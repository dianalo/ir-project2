MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Jesse Jackson is sounding an Easterseason call for renewed humanitarian efforts to gain freedom forAmerican hostages held in Lebanon, saying that ``we should go onthe offensive, the moral offensive.''   ``Renewed effort and hope must replace futility,'' Jackson said.``It's time now to roll the stone away.''   Nine Americans are held hostage in Lebanon, as are six men fromother foreign nations. Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped onMarch 16, 1985.   ``We are concerned about all of those who are held captive,whether they are Lebanese or French or British of American,''Jackson said in an interview on the hostage situation. ``We areconcerned that a whole nation is held captive to these continuedshellings and bombings.   ``In a sense, Terry and the others are prisoners of war.''   Anderson had covered Jackson's 1984 mission to Syria which ledto the release of a Navy lieutenant whose plane was shot downduring a U.S. raid over Lebanon. The Navy man was held for a month,then released to Jackson. Anderson himself was seized by gunmen inBeirut little more than 15 months later.   Jackson said it is important that the Lebanese Moslems holdingU.S. hostages know that Americans are concerned about therebuilding of that country, about children in refugee camps, aboutbombing and shelling.   ``We are concerned about that,'' he said. ``So was Terry.''   ``We should not take the position that Lebanon is a no man'sland cursed with eternal and perpetual war,'' the black civilrights and political leader, twice a Democratic presidentialcandidate, said in the interview. He said the United States shouldmake clear that it is prepared to help rebuild and restore Lebanon,just as Europe was rebuilt after World War II.   He advanced no new proposals for hostage release efforts, buturged a return to some that have been tried before, saying that thearms-for-hostage deal with Iran had undone humanitarian effortsthat might otherwise have made headway.   Two Americans were released during the Reagan administration'sarms-for-hostages dealings with Iran.   Jackson said that at the time, the administration complainedthat ``citizen-to-citizen appeals would get in the way ofgovernment operations. Then it turned out that governmentoperations meant straight swaps of hostages for arms and money.   ``We want to put the focus again back on the captured as well ason our concern about the basic agony of the captors,'' he said.   Jackson said he is seeking sponsors and support for an effort toreach the captors of American and other hostages throughadvertisements and announcements in newspapers and on radio andtelevision in the area.   ``We have no way of knowing the impact, but we do know that theyare read,'' he said.   Jackson said he would make the radio and TV tapes and would signthe advertisements.   ``In Lebanon, the captors are basically nameless and faceless,''Jackson said. ``Therefore the appeal has to be a broad-based appealto the religious and political leaders, and to others who care.''   Jackson said he has talked with religious leaders from Lebanonduring the past few weeks and will continue those appeals. ``Weshould not leave our friends in an out-of-sight, out-of-mindposition,'' he said.   He also suggested that the United States should seek action onits offer to pay reparations to the families of 290 people killedwhen an Iran Air jetliner was shot down by mistake by a U.S.warship in the Persian Gulf last summer. That has been stalledbecause the Tehran government has not proposed a system for directpayment to the families.   Jackson said he would be prepared to return to the Middle Eastin the cause of the hostages if he had leads and contacts thatwould indicate it would help.   ``Whenever I make these approaches, I always do so with respectfor our government and whatever plans it may have,'' Jackson said.``But I still think that within the law, citizens have the rightand the obligation, citizen to citizen, church to church, to alsomake appeals and approaches.   ``Sometimes there's less hostility to citizens.''</TEXT></DOC>
