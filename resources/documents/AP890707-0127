Gotti, younger brother of John Gotti, the man law enforcers callthe head of the Gambino crime family and one of the nation's mostpowerful criminals, showed no reaction as U.S. District Judge JohnR. Bartels sentenced him.   Co-defendant John Carneglia also was sentenced to 50 years, andboth men were fined $75,000.   They were convicted May 23 of running a multimillion-dollarheroin ring.   ``These are very serious crimes,'' said Bartels. ``The governmenthas proved these defendants are members of the Gambino crime familyand that their allegiance is placed above the laws of this country.''   Defense lawyers said they were shocked by the severity of thesentence, but confident the conviction would be overturned on appeal.   Gotti and Carneglia will remain at the Metropolitan CorrectionalCenter at least until fall, pending the outcome of their appeals.   Gotti, 42, of Valley Stream, and Carneglia, 44, of New York,would likely spend 25 years in jail before becoming eligible forparole, said U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney.   Authorities describe Gotti as a Gambino capo, or captain, andCarneglia as a soldier in the family reputedly involved inloansharking, extortion, labor rackets, gambling and drug dealing.   Defense attorneys Gerald Shargel and Ronald Fischetti argued forlighter sentences, saying their clients have wives and children andhave been convicted of no crimes since their arrest on the drugcharges in August 1983.   Gotti and Carneglia have been jailed since June 29, the day afterBartels revoked bail because he found they had continued to dealdrugs and associate with other mobsters after their conviction.   At the bail hearing, an FBI agent testified that Gotti helped hisbrother John plan the assassination of the former Gambino boss, PaulCastellano, to escape a possible mob death sentence for dealingheroin.   John Gotti took command of the Gambino family after Castellanoand his bodyguard were shot Dec. 16, 1985, outside a restaurant,law-enforcement officials say.   Under Castellano's rules for his crime family, trafficking inheroin was punishable by death, the agent testified.   Gene Gotti and Carneglia had remained free on $1 million baileach while the case made its way through the courts. The caseresulted in two mistrials and became one of the oldest cases on thefederal docket.</TEXT></DOC>
