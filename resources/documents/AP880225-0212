Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost, visiting Pakistan,said the plan announced this week by the seven-party guerrillaalliance was a ``very welcome step toward the resolution of theAfghan problem.''   The alliance, led by Yunis Khalis and based in Pakistan,proposes an executive council of all seven guerrilla leaders topreside over a 28-member Cabinet of rebels, Afghan refugees and``Moslems presently living in Kabul.''   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979 andan estimated 115,000 now are in the country helping fight theguerrillas.   About 3.5 million Afghans have fled to neighboring Pakistan.Most live in border cities and camps that serve as bases and supplypoints for the guerrillas.   Thursday's editions of the Afghan Communist Party newspaper Anissaid the plan ``resembles more a hysterical and disturbed dream,''Kabul radio reported.   ``It is clear that this void and unfounded plan has nolegitimacy and therefore is unacceptable,'' the paper said, addingthat the insurgent proposal was like the ``story of sharing thewolf's prey.''   The radio also broadcast a Foreign Ministry statement that``there is only one legal government in Afghanistan, which has beenrecognized by 80 countries in the world.''   Armacost arrived Wednesday to discuss progress toward Sovietwithdrawal. He met with President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, and a U.S.Embassy official said he also had ``frank and open'' discussionswith leaders of the Moslem guerrillas.   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Feb. 8 that Soviet troops will startpulling out May 15 if U.N.-sponsored talks in Geneva betweenAfghanistan and Pakistan bring a settlement by March 15, andcomplete the withdrawal in 10 months. The talks are to resumeWednesday.   Pakistan demands a military settlement be accompanied by apolitical one to ensure transitional stability. Washington, whichsupports the guerrillas, has devoted most of its effort toobtaining a withdrawal.</TEXT></DOC>
