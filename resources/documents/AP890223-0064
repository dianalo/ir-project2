The first lady's decision was disclosed today by her presssecretary, Anna Perez, as Mrs. Bush arrived in Tokyo with herhusband to attend the funeral of Emperor Hirohito on Friday.   Ms. Perez said Mrs. Bush had adopted a new policy oncontroversial issues such as guns and abortion.   ``She will not discuss them,'' the spokeswoman said. ``They arenot the issues where she wishes to have a focus. It doesn't mean shedoesn't have a right to an opinion. It means she has a right todiscuss them or not.''   Ms. Perez said the first lady has decided instead to highlightsuch concerns as the homeless, AIDS and illiteracy.   Mrs. Bush and the president appeared at odds after she said in aninterview with The Associated Press that she ``absolutely'' favorsbanning military-style assault weapons such as the one used recentlyin a schoolyard massacre in Stockton, Calif., in which five childrenwere killed and more than two dozen children were wounded.   The president, questioned separately, said he does not believesemiautomatic weapons should be banned because they are used bysportsmen and hunters. A semiautomatic AK-47 was used in theStockton incident.   Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, thenation's biggest gun lobby, said police should do more to enforceexisting gun laws.   Ms. Perez quoted the first lady as saying ``there isn't that muchof a difference of opinion'' between her and the president over theissue of outlawing assault-style weapons.   ``If there is, they will discuss it among themselves,'' Ms. Perezsaid.   The press secretary said Mrs. Bush does not want her views to bethe focus of attention.   ``She's not the one that makes policy,'' Ms. Perez said. ``Shedoesn't lobby Congress. She's not the president.''   Reflecting Mrs. Bush's views, Ms. Perez said, ``The opinions thatare important, that require the spotlight, are those of herhusband.''   Mrs. Bush wore an elegant black suit and her customary strand offake pearls today for tea with Naoko Takeshita, wife of JapanesePrime Minister Noboru Takeshita.   ``How very, very kind of you to invite me,'' said Mrs. Bush asshe greeted Mrs. Takeshita, who wore a navy blue suit.   They met at the official residence of the Takeshitas, althoughthe family actually lives in a private home in Tokyo.   Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Takeshita drank tea and coffee at a marbletable in a small, green-carpeted room decorated with flowers and apastel painting of Mount Fuji.   Mrs. Bush expressed her sympathy over Hirohito's death and Mrs.Takeshita offered her congratulations on Bush's election aspresident, Ms. Perez said.</TEXT></DOC>
