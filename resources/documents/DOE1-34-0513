Many individuals infected with HIVeventually develop an immunodeficiency characterized by selective depletionof CD4/sup +/ lymphocytes that is associated with a variety of opportunisticinfections and/or Kaposi's sarcoma. The pathogenetic mechanism, wherebya subclinical infection leads to overt clinical disease, is poorly understood.As many HIV-infected individuals harbor a variety of microorganisms,the possibility exists that some of these pathogens can act as cofactorscapable of stimulating HIV expression and thereby accelerate the diseaseprocess. In this paper, the authors investigated one class of cofactors,DNA viruses, for their ability to augment gene expression of the HIVlong terminal repeat (LTR). These viral cofactors include members ofthe papovavirus and herpesvirus families and encode gene products thatstimulate HIV gene expression in specific host cells. The implicationsof this observation for viral latency and the course of HIV disease arealso discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
