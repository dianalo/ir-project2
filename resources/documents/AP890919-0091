(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The jury at Jim Bakker's fraud trial todaywatched a videotape in which the TV evangelist pleaded for millionsin donations while assuring followers, ``I would not lie to youabout anything.''   Prosecutors on Monday began showing the eight-hour tape culledfrom broadcasts of Bakker's ``The PTL Show.''   On the tape, Bakker asked followers to send $1,000 in exchangefor ``lifetime partnerships'' guaranteeing three nights' lodging ayear for life at PTL's Heritage USA theme park.   A segment played today had Bakker encouraging viewers to usetheir credit cards to buy a partnership.   ``I'm sincere, I would not lie to you about anything,'' Bakkertold viewers in 1984. He explained that he paid for his ownpartnership by credit card because he did not have the cash.   ``Mr. IRS got to me first, Uncle Sam just took everything wecould scrape together,'' he said.   On Monday, actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr. testified that the PTL boardof directors, on which he once served, was little more than a rubberstamp for Bakker.   Bakker is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million in PTLmoney raised from the partnerships so that he could live in style.If convicted on all 24 counts, Bakker could be sentenced to 120years in prison and fined more than $5 million.   Witnesses have testified they bought the partnerships but couldnot get rooms. Others testified that partnerships were oversold andthat the money often was used to cover PTL's day-to-day operatingcosts rather than finance construction of the guaranteed rooms.         FBI agent Harold Pearson, who compiled the videotape, said morethan 66,000 partnerships were sold to viewers by the time Bakkerleft PTL, despite a publicized limit of 25,000.   ``All we need is 25,000 people to become members,'' Bakker saidon a program televised Feb. 20, 1984. ``That's all the membershipswe can have in the Heritage Grand Hotel. In two weeks, we will beclosed.''   On the tape, Bakker consistently mentioned the restrictions.   ``When we reach the cutoff number, we will have to refuse thegifts,'' he told viewers. ``To be honest, we can't offer morememberships than we can physically handle.''   On a March 7, 1984, show, Bakker told viewers that about 1,000partnerships had been sold each day since the promotion began 13days earlier. But Pearson said records showed fewer than 7,300 hadbeen sold at that point.   About a week earlier, Bakker said 12,500 partnerships had beensold.   ``The memberships will be gone in a few days,'' Bakker said.   Zimbalist testified that the PTL board of directors did notchallenge Bakker.   ``It was called a board of directors, but at no time did itoperate like one,'' said Zimbalist, star of ``The FBI'' televisionseries and board member from 1981 to 1986. ``It was a board ofapproval or affirmation only.''   Asked if he recalled approving a $390,000 bonus for Bakker,Zimbalist said, ``Oh no, oh no.''   The white-haired actor, who testified during a break in theproduction in Spain of a television series, ``Zorro,'' said theboard was not informed of financial problems at its meetings.   ``The financial condition of PTL was never discussed,'' he said.   Asked if he would have approved bonuses had he known about thefinancial condition of the ministry, Zimbalist said, ``I think Iwould have left the board at that point if that were the case.''</TEXT></DOC>
