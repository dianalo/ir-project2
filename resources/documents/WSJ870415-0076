Rough spoke to a group of bankers yesterday, but failed to mention a subject that was on many of their minds: The Justice Department investigation into allegations he leaked confidential Federal Reserve Bank data to a securities firm.    Fed officials have said they believe the inquiry marks the first time a director of the system has been suspected of such a breach of trust since the Fed was organized in 1913. Mr. Rough was director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1982 through 1984.    Mr. Rough addressed a convention of the New Jersey Bankers Association in Palm Beach, Fla. As outgoing chairman of the group, he talked about things like regional banking and legislation. But he didn't discuss the Fed. And afterward, he declined to comment on the allegations, as he has since they became public last week.    &quot;He's in a very difficult position,&quot; said one New Jersey bank executive at the session, Richard G. Post. &quot;Fortunately for our country, a man is innocent till proven guilty, and his side has yet to speak.&quot; Added Donald T. Senterfitt, a past president of the American Bankers Association: &quot;I think it's unfortunate that accusations get made like that in public without an opportunity for the person to present his side. A person ought not to be branded with something until there's been a complete hearing and an opportunity for both sides to be heard.&quot;    As previously reported, allegations against Mr. Rough came to light in the securities fraud trial of Gilbert C. Schulman, former president of Bevill, Bresler andamp; Schulman Inc., a defunct government securities brokerage. Mr. Rough is not a defendant in the case.    According to court testimony, Mr. Rough allegedly leaked interest-rate-sensitive information to executives of Bevill Bresler in exchange for a $47,000 loan, the U.S. attorney's office in Newark, N.J., said. Former executives of Bevill Bresler testified they tried to use the inside data to make money in trading, according the U.S. attorney.    Testimony in a federal court trial in Newark alleged that Mr. Rough, of Hainesville, N.J., &quot;routinely&quot; leaked, in advance of public disclosure, information on the Fed's closely guarded discount rate, the U.S. attorney's office said. Changes in the discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges financial institutions for loans -- signal the direction in which the Fed is attempting to push interest rates and often precipitate changes in other interest rates and in the prices of debt securities.    The FBI, the U.S. attorney in Newark, and the New York Fed are jointly investigating the allegations against Mr. Rough.    Before the convention, the president of the New Jersey bankers group, Robert C. Forrey, had said that Mr. Rough has denied any wrongdoing. &quot;He stated the allegation is totally false and I am confident of his integrity,&quot; Mr. Forrey said.    The association initially said Mr. Rough would issue a statement Sunday, but Mr. Forrey said later that Mr. Rough had changed his mind and wouldn't comment, on the advice of counsel.    Mr. Rough, whose first job out of college was as an examiner at the New York Fed in 1961, &quot;has always shown the utmost respect, and even reverence for the Federal Reserve System. That's why these allegations are particularly difficult,&quot; said Mr. Forrey.    Authorities say they have no evidence implicating any one else at the Fed in leaking information on the discount rate.    Constantinos I. Costalas, treasurer of the state bankers association, said he was &quot;stunned&quot; by the allegations. Mr. Costalas, who is also chairman of the Glendale National Bank of New Jersey, in Voorhees, N.J., said of Mr. Rough, &quot;I just looked at him as having the highest integrity.&quot;    The last known breach of the Fed's security system occurred in late 1982, but it didn't involve a director. A former Fed employee, who had left his job to join E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. as an analyst, tried to get unauthorized advance information about Fed money-supply numbers by using a former colleague's name and access code to tap into the Fed's computer. He lost his job at Hutton, and was given a year's suspended sentence. </TEXT></DOC>
