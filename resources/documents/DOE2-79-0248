This tolerance can be based onboth functional requirements and an allowance for measurement error.Sandia National Laboratories has provided general guidance for settingtolerances for its parts in Sandia General Requirements Specification9900000, Sec. 3.3.2, titled Absolute Tolerance Concept. Implementingthis guidance, particularly for parts other than Sandia's, has been asource of controversy, so in 1986 a Working Group of DOE statisticiansundertook a study of statistical aspects of tolerance specification.This report presents the Group's analysis and findings. Several measuresof consumer's risk were defined and then evaluated with respect to computationalconvenience, information requirement, rationale, and economic considerations.As an aid in setting tolerances, several cost models were consideredand the optimum tolerances derived and compared. Because cost considerationshave a major effect on the choice of tolerances, it is recommended thatdesign and production personnel attempt to realistically model the costof nonconformance in jointly arriving at appropriate measurement tolerances.9 refs., 4 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
