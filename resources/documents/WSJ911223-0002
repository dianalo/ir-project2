The IG's office at the Veterans Administration inWashington, D.C., that is conducting the investigationdeclined to name the company or companies and the hospitalsinvolved. &quot;It wouldn't be fair to the companies and thepeople if we were to identify them at this time,&quot; saidMichael Costello, assistant inspector general forinvestigation.</LP><TEXT>   He would only confirm that his office is investigating whyveterans' hospitals, in their requests for bids for servicecontracts, used restrictive language that favored themanufacturer of the machine. In response to complaints fromindependent service companies, the VA's office of policy,planning and resources reviewed the VA's service contracts.In a special report, issued last June, it reported that 21 ofthe 36 contracts it investigated &quot;contained restrictivespecifications . . . that could only have been achieved bythe original equipment manufacturer, in this case, Picker.&quot;   Picker International Inc., whose tactics were the subjectof a front-page story in this newspaper last October, hasinstalled its machines in more than 90% of the nation's VAmedical centers. The Cleveland-based unit of Britain'sGeneral Electric Co. PLC, which isn't related to the GeneralElectric Co. based in Fairfield, Conn., has disagreed withthe report. Picker didn't return calls seeking comment on theInspector General's investigation.   John Keller, president of Houston-based Electronics inMedicine Inc., said a week ago that IG investigatorscontacted him to ask whether he knew of any &quot;bribery andentertaining of VA officials by Picker.&quot; Electronics inMedicine, also known as ETEK, is an independent servicecompany that has sued Picker in a federal court in Texas,charging, among other things, &quot;tortious interference withexisting and prospective contracts&quot; by Picker.   Thomas Quinn, president of IES Inc., a Pittsburgh-basedindependent service company also involved in litigationagainst Picker, said federal investigators &quot;spent a wholeday&quot; going through his files in search of evidence of whether&quot;Picker influenced government employees.&quot;   Mr. Costello, the assistant inspector general forinvestigation at the VA, said his investigators are lookingat whether there is any evidence of &quot;fraud, conflict ofinterest, and bribery&quot; and will turn over the findings to theU.S. Justice Department to determine whether any action iswarranted.   The high-tech medical machines, such as computedtomography or CT, and magnetic resonance imaging or MRI,machines, are used in imaging internal organs for medicaldiagnosis. They cost between $1 million and $2 millionapiece, and hospitals that purchase them also obtaincontracts to service and maintain the machines. The cost ofthese service contracts typically ranges between $125,000 and$200,000 annually.   This service and maintenance market, estimated to be about$3 billion annually, is dominated by the manufacturers of themachines, which include General Electric Co. of Fairfield,Conn., N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, Germany's Siemens AG,and Japan's Toshiba Corp. A burgeoning industry ofindependent service organizations, which hospitals say offersimilar service contracts at 40% to 50% cheaper, have beencomplaining in their suits and countersuits against themanufacturers that they are being kept out of the market bythe manufacturers' restrictive software licensing agreementsand parts-supply policies.   The broader issue of whether manufacturers' refusal tolicense crucial diagnostic software, other maintenancemanuals and parts to independent companies amounts tostifling competition is currently the subject of pendinglawsuits, including one in the U.S. Supreme Court.</TEXT></DOC>
