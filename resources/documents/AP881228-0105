The presidential proclamation said the extension will give theUnited States, for an additional nine miles offshore, ``asovereignty and jurisdiction that extend to the airspace over theterritorial sea, as well as to its bed and subsoil.''   Assistant White House Press Secretary Bob Hall said the actionwas taken because almost all other countries in the world use the12-mile limit, and the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea hadcalled on all nations to conform.   The president said the action ``will advance the nationalsecurity and other significant interests of the United States.''   The proclamation said the new limit applies to the ``territorialsea of the United States of America, the Commonwealth of PuertoRico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, theCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and any otherterritory or possession over which the United States exercisessovereignty.''   Reagan said ships of all countries would continue to have ``theright of innocent passage'' through U.S. territorial waters andships and aircraft of all countries would have ``the right oftransit passage through international straits.''   He said the proclamation does not extend or alter existingfederal or state law, or impair the determination of maritimeboundaries.</TEXT></DOC>
