Euan Baird, chairman and chief executive officer, told a meeting of securities analysts in New York that the company doesn't plan to increase its level of cash; Schlumberger's net liquidity is &quot;at a comfortable level of $500 million,&quot; he said.    The big world-wide oil-service company recently completed the repurchase of 30.5 million shares at $35 each, or about $1.07 billion, leaving it with 238 million common shares outstanding.    Schlumberger doesn't expect any major increases in oil prices over the next few years. But Mr. Baird said aggressive moves by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries into downstream operations may put OPEC in a position to raise prices in the early 1990s.    Mr. Baird declined to estimate results for the fourth quarter or year. For the year-ago fourth quarter, Schlumberger earned $315.8 million, or $1.15 a share, on revenue of $1.3 billion. Total 1987 net was $352.6 million, or $1.27 a share, on revenue of $4.73 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
