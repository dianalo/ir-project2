Christopher</HL><DATE>06/13/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14</SO><LP>   In the general rejoicing over the historic blow that thebig tuna canners recently struck in defense of dolphins,nobody seems to be paying much attention to the unhappy lotof another group of our fellow creatures. Who, as Dr. Seussmight put it, speaks for the fish? How is it that the samefolks who struggled so valiantly to make the seas safe fordolphins and whales can dig into a tuna salad platter or adish of herring in sour cream without blinking an eye?   Chances are that your instinctive response to thosequestions will be that tuna and herrings, after all, aren'tendangered species. True enough, but neither are dolphins normost kinds of whales. If preserving species from extinctionwere actually the central issue, there would be no need for aban on all commercial whaling nor for imposing on U.S. tunafishermen restrictions that could drive them to abandon theirtraditional fishing grounds to foreign fleets that kill evenmore tuna.</LP><TEXT>   But if pure environmentalism isn't the spur, what doesexplain the protective urge that dolphins and whales arousein so many of us and that tuna and flounder so conspicuouslyfail to stir? The answer, I believe, is inescapable. Fish arescaly, cold-blooded creatures with no communications skillsand nerdlike personalities. Dolphins and whales, on the otherhand, are whimsical, warm-blooded extroverts who, just likeus humans, can sing, whistle and solve simple quadraticequations. (Well, just like some of us humans anyway;personally, I can't sing for sour apples and have neverknowingly solved a quadratic equation in my life.)   What we're talking about here, in other words, ismammalian chauvinist piggery. And like all other forms ofchauvinist piggery, this one rests on some pretty flimsyfoundations. Isn't it sheer cultural arrogance to assume thatfish are fit only for bouillabaisse simply because theyaren't as good at humanoid activities as dolphins? We try toeliminate culture-specific and gender-specific questions frompolicemen's and firefighters' exams these days, don't we? Sowhere do we get off setting up species-specificqualifications for immunity from being broiled, baked orsauteed?   Similarly, to argue that fish rate less consideration thandolphins or whales because they are less intelligent issurely nothing but elitism. And in this day and age the evilsof elitism hardly need belaboring. Start down that slipperyslope and the next thing you know they'll be re-introducingtracking into your local high school.   I'm under no illusion about the magnitude of the problemI'm attacking. There are millions of folks out there sounimaginative and indifferent to basic philosophical concernsthat it would take sustained public-relations wizardry of thehighest order to sensitize them to the plight of Charlie theTuna. But, hey, that's one field where we Americans are stillacknowledged to be world leaders, and I'm going to try topick up some tips from our local Greenpeace person as soon aspossible. Maybe over lunch at this little place I know wherethey have the most terrific fish chowder.   ---   Mr. Christopher is a journalist and author who isunusually fond of fish.</TEXT></DOC>
