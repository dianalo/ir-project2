A member of a class of minerals termed zeolites,it differs markedly from asbestos in many physico-chemical characteristics.For preliminary biological studies, experiments were based on the hypothesisthat the active surface sites within the internal voids are contributoryto the unusual activity of this mineral. Two approaches were followed:encapsulation of isopentane into the internal spaces and exchange ofcations, Cr{sup 2+} and Ca{sup 2+}. Preliminary data suggests that toxicityto V79 cells was altered by these processes. The implication of the intensetumorigenesis of erionite may be of great basic importance in contributingdata for mechanistic studies such as the illumination of a second variablein tumor induction.</TEXT></DOC>
