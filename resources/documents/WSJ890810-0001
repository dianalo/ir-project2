The president said the White House was open to talks to win the release of captives in Lebanon, but ruled out &quot;trading&quot; for their freedom. Bush also renewed an appeal for Iran's help in the hostage crisis. In southern Lebanon, a Moslem launched a suicide attack on Israeli troops, driving an explosives-laden truck into an army convoy. Six people were wounded. The pro-Iranian Hezbollah called the assault a &quot;down payment&quot; for Israel's abduction of a Shiite cleric.    Israel said the attack was &quot;another horrible reminder&quot; of security problems along its northern border, and an official in the area threatened to retaliate.    ---   POWELL IS EXPECTED to be named chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.    The four-star Army general, national security adviser to Reagan, is expected to be named to the post by Bush today, a senior administration official said. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the nation's senior military officer, is the principal military adviser to the president and defense secretary. Powell would become the first black to hold the post. Upon confirmation by the Senate, the 52-year-old Powell would succeed Adm. Crowe, who is to retire Sept. 30.    Bush's decision means that Powell, who is expected to be well-received on Capitol Hill, will leapfrog over several more senior military officers.    ---   Poland's Peasant Party leader said the traditional Communist Party ally would join Solidarity in voting against a Communist-led coalition government. In Gdansk, officials of the trade union called for a one-hour strike Friday at 470 factories to protest food price increases of as much as 500% under a government-imposed &quot;marketization&quot; plan.    ---   The Justice Department confirmed that it has asked some prestigious colleges and universities for documents as part of an antitrust inquiry into tuition and student-aid rates.

The U.S. troops withdrew after the soldiers were exchanged for two arrested Panamanians. The fort is a shared U.S.-Panama area that houses Noriega's office.    ---   HUD aides provided lucrative housing subsidies and gave preferential treatment to a housing project linked to Pierce's old law firm and politically connected developers.    Records show that funding for the Amherst, N.Y., project was awarded in an irregular fashion and that a waiver of federal rules was granted in 1988.    ---   Japan's Kaifu assumed the office of prime minister and, in an apparent attempt to bolster the Liberal Democratic Party's image as it heads into parliamentary elections, included two women in his new cabinet. Kaifu's other cabinet choices maintained an acceptable balance between the various LDP factions.    ---   About 20,000 ethnic Russians joined a strike in the republic of Estonia to protest Tuesday's approval of legislation that tightens residency requirements to vote and run for public office. The new law was aimed at stemming the influence of Estonia's Russian minority. The strike affected several factories and public transport.    ---   Ethiopian rescue workers extended their search into Sudan in an attempt to find Democratic Rep.

Poor track conditions and bad weather in Sinaloa state appeared to have caused the accident, at least the fifth involving a train in Mexico this year.    ---   China's leadership expelled two leading social scientists from the Communist Party. Yan Jiaqi and Bao Zunxin, who urged the dismissal of Premier Li Peng in May, are believed to be the first party members ousted in Beijing's two-month-old crackdown on dissent. They also lost their research posts, the Xinhua news agency said.    ---   Hungary's fledgling opposition said the Communist Party had destroyed the nation in 42 years of rule, but offered to cooperate with some lawmakers after free elections planned for next year. The parliamentary group ruled out any coalition with the Communists before the general elections.    ---   Three Salvadoran rebels were killed in fighting with government forces after President Cristiani urged the guerrillas to adopt a cease-fire ahead of peace talks with the rightist government.
