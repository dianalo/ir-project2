In 1988they invested nearly one-third of the $6.5 billion they spenton all research and development looking for medicines for theheart.   The incentives are huge. Nearly 66 million Americans, orone in four, suffer some type of cardiovascular problem, andmore than one million people are expected to die from suchailments this year. Last year, 48 drug companies weredeveloping 91 medicines to treat patients with diseasedhearts and coronary arteries, hypertension and stroke.</LP><TEXT>   For all the work in the field, none of these experimentalcompounds are cures. At best, these medicines are more potentand produce fewer side effects than existing therapies. Noneof them can reverse the damage to the heart and its arteriescaused by decades of high blood pressure, the clogging ofarteries by fatty plaques or the killing of heart musclecaused by a heart attack.   But scientists say advances taking place in a few dozenlaboratories suggest that by the end of the century drugmakers will be testing medicines designed to reverse thecourse of disease.   &quot;The important new drugs in the future won't justameliorate disease but, instead, will prevent thephysiological changes that, over time, lead to high bloodpressure, heart attacks and angina,&quot; says Jay Cohn, a leadingheart-disease researcher at the University of MinnesotaSchool of Medicine. &quot;Such drugs will profoundly affect thefrequency of disease by inhibiting disease at the most basic,cellular level in the body.&quot;   Driving this optimism is the rapid pace at whichscientists are uncovering the inner workings of cells that,when in proper condition, keep the cardiovascular systemrunning efficiently. Principal targets for this research arereceptors, spikelike chemicals on the surface of cellsthrough which hormones and enzymes control thousands ofminute actions taking place instantaneously.   It is widely believed that defects in these receptors,often caused by mutated genes, underlie most heart disease.The important heart drugs of the future will repair thesedefects, scientists predict.   Scientists are convinced the decadeslong buildup of fattydeposits that eventually block blood flow to the heart --causing angina and heart attacks -- occurs only in peopleborn with one of about a dozen receptor defects. The mosteffective drugs now under study for lowering cholesterol workby coaxing certain receptors to soak up excess cholesterol inthe bloodstream. Already one such drug is available --Mevacor, produced Merck andamp; Co. A half-dozen similar drugs arein advanced stages of testing.   &quot;The challenge to developing even better drugs is to getat the other receptors involved in normal cholesterolprocessing,&quot; says Edgar Haber, the director of research atBristol-Myers Squibb Corp. &quot;If we knew exactly whichreceptors were defective in an individual, we could tailorvery potent drugs that, given early in life, would go a longway toward preventing disease.&quot;   Dr. Haber says researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb alsoare chasing after cell receptors that normally regulate themusclelike tissue surrounding coronary arteries. Drugs thatcan affect these receptors, thereby relaxing the muscletissue, could keep the arteries from constricting, thustreating a common type of angina. It is hoped that thesedrugs would be targeted specifically at receptors near theheart, thus avoiding the side effects of currentvessel-dilating drugs that work throughout the body.   Researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Upjohn Co.,SmithKline Beecham PLC. and elsewhere have been racing forseveral years to create drugs that would block the action ofrenin, a kidney hormone. Renin is known to turn on numerousreceptors that control cells involved in the pumping actionof the heart. Scientists believe a renin-inhibiting drugwould be a potent treatment for high blood pressure and alsowould reduce the workload burdening hearts that have beenseverely weakened by a heart attack.   To date, the hunt for a useful renin blocker has failed.Instead, scientists now are pursuing compounds that interactdirectly with the renin receptors. It might be possible toadminister such drugs beginning early in life to repairinborn receptor defects.   But, the scientists say, breakthroughs in receptortechnology must also be accompanied by better methods atdetecting which individuals have specific receptor defects.One technique will rely on the growing ability for scientiststo test a person's genetic material to determine whether agene responsible for the production of a particular receptoris damaged. Another technique will depend on whetherscientists can create imaging devices that can see thebuildup of artery plaque or constricted vessels years beforethe first dangerous signs of disease appear.   &quot;When that happens, and most everyone in the fieldbelieves it will,&quot; says Dr. Cohn of Minnesota, &quot;we will havemoved into a new age of disease prevention much better thananything we can do now.&quot;   ---   Mr. Waldholz covers medicine from The Wall StreetJournal's New York bureau.   ---                   A Guide to Heart Drugs                                                                                                          Here's a listing of some of the major drug groups and someof the more commonly used drugs to treat problems caused bycardiovascular disease.
