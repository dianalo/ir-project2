This town's swimming pool is now open to all races, as isthe library, golf course, tennis court and rugby field. Eventhe Dutch Reformed Church, which elevated the politics ofracial segregation to theology, recently opened its localhall to blacks and &quot;coloreds&quot; (people of mixed-race) for ahealth seminar.</LP><TEXT>   All of this is enough to make the town's white forefathersturn in their graves. But the real revolution is happeninginside city hall, where whites and blacks sit at the sametable and pour each other coffee while slowly shapingKirkwood -- with its 1,500 whites, 1,500 coloreds and 12,000blacks -- into South Africa's first non-racial city. Like theBerliners who hammered their Cold War wall to rubble, thepeople of Kirkwood are chipping away at apartheid's walls.   &quot;We are one community, very closely related to eachother,&quot; says Johan Erasmus, Kirkwood's white mayor. &quot;The onlydistance between us was created by apartheid. It is time toclose this distance, to destroy the barriers.&quot;   For decades, white men gathered in these council chambersto divide rather than unite. They kept for themselves thefruits of the lush Sundays River valley, while the coloredswere stuck behind a barren hill out beyond the watertreatment plant. The blacks were moved three miles fartherout, beyond another fold of hills. Out of sight and out ofmind, the non-white communities became feudal villages ofpoverty and despair, deprived of the things whites enjoyed:electricity, paved roads, indoor plumbing and dignity.   These days, the white councilors are joined by an equalnumber of blacks and coloreds. Flanked by a huge SouthAfrican flag and the town's coat of arms, they thrash outmunicipal affairs as a team, deciding together which road topave next and who gets to use the rugby field this weekend.Equally important, they discuss political differences, argueabout the past and share their dreams for the future.   &quot;Sometimes we talk to each other quite loudly,&quot; saysMpumelelo Tiyo, the black secretary of the inter-racialcouncil. He smiles broadly. &quot;But we can talk like that now.It shows we are making progress.&quot;   Though change is fueling violence elsewhere, Kirkwood'sstyle of racial rapprochement is nonetheless catching on. Mr.Erasmus gets calls from other mayors seeking advice inmanaging the country's nervous transition. And both theruling National Party and the main black liberation group,the African National Congress, support the &quot;Kirkwood model&quot;as a way to reduce tensions locally while government and ANCnegotiators work things out on the national level.   But, as the people of Kirkwood are discovering, when wallscome down the differences they hid become more glaring. &quot;Wesee that there is a lot of mistrust amongst us that built upover the years,&quot; says Mr. Erasmus, a gregarious Afrikaner.&quot;If we can create a climate of trust, it will make it mucheasier to accept whatever comes in the future.&quot;   This change of heart by Kirkwood's whites wasn't broughton by a sudden surge of altruism. In fact, many whites werehoping that the seismic political events of last year -- thewhite government's unbanning of both the ANC and the SouthAfrican Communist Party, and the release of ANC leader NelsonMandela -- would somehow bypass their valley. Then came ablack consumer boycott of Main Street's white stores lastspring, followed by a farm workers' strike at the height ofthe fruit picking season.   As the valley's citrus fruits lay rotting, the whitesfinally faced up to something apartheid had taught them todeny: South Africans, no matter their color, need oneanother. The whites listened to their neighbors' grievancesand set up a joint management committee to act on them. Theboycott and strikes ended. From here on, the valley'sabundance would be shared.   &quot;The boycott opened the eyes of white businessmen to seethat their bread is buttered by the black side of theeconomy,&quot; says Philip du Plessis, a white town councilor andowner of a liquor store. &quot;We realize that we do need thesepeople.&quot;   As eyes have opened, so have minds. &quot;We can see a changein attitude among the whites toward us,&quot; says Boy Finnis, a27-year-old colored who led the boycott and now leads thetalks with the white councilors. &quot;We brought home the pointthat we are suffering in this beautiful valley.&quot;   Electricity, paved roads and more water taps for thenon-white townships are now on the way. In the Main Streetshops, black customers are now served as they come in, ratherthan having to wait until all the whites are first satisfied.Instead of neglect and humiliation, there is recognition andrespect.   &quot;Whites are now seeing us as people who live with them onthe same earth,&quot; says Mr. Tiyo. &quot;They accept us,&quot; he says,&quot;as human beings.&quot;   Mr. Erasmus, 49 years old, lives in an elegant ranch houseon one of his several farms on Kirkwood's outskirts.Sprinklers water the front lawn, bringing out the vivid reds,pinks and purples of the bouganvillea. Several cars sit inthe driveway. A piano and antique organ fill the living room.His wife serves a round of juice, squeezed from the orangesout back.   In this comfortable spot, the mayor squirms as heconsiders what apartheid has wrought. &quot;Even though we've beenliving in Kirkwood for decades, we've developed into threeseparate communities. We don't know each other,&quot; he says.&quot;Oh, they know us, because they work in town, in our houses,on our farms. But we don't know them.&quot;   He wonders how many of his fellow whites know, forinstance, that the black and colored children have to dotheir homework by the light of parafin lamps. &quot;They're fellowSouth Africans, but they have to live like that,&quot; he says,grimacing.   In reconstructing city management, he and the other whitecouncilors, all staunch National Party members, decided tobypass apartheid's hand-picked &quot;town councils&quot; in the coloredand black townships and deal directly with the popularcommunity leaders who led the boycott. Bontrug, the blackarea, and Bergsig, the colored area, were unofficiallybrought into the white town as two additional wards. Today, amanagement committee of six whites, four blacks and twocoloreds -- the latter six all avid supporters of the AfricanNational Congress -- set priorities. In the past severalmonths, they have freed up several million dollars of federalmoney that was earmarked for development but never spent.   Joe Tibshraeny, whose family has been running the townbutcher shop since 1912, was the mayor in the late 1970s. Hesays he &quot;more or less&quot; knew the conditions in Bontrug, butfigured any upgrading was the responsibility of thegovernment's Bantu Administration Board.   &quot;Maybe we did slip up in the past,&quot; he admits, &quot;likeeverywhere else in the country.&quot;   A black man enters the shop, which was hit hard by theboycott, and Mr. Tibshraeny jumps up from his chair andbegins slicing some choice lamb chops. &quot;They used to come inand ask for a shilling, 10 cents, of scrap meat,&quot; he says asthe customer leaves. Marveling at black advancement in thecommunity, he adds: &quot;Now, they come in and ask for a T-bone.Same as a white man.&quot;   When the swimming pool was first opened, some members ofthe pro-apartheid Conservative Party put up signs saying&quot;Kaffirs carry AIDS.&quot; (&quot;Kaffir&quot; is the equivalent of&quot;nigger.&quot;) But the controversy faded quickly. The firstnon-white rugby tournament on the previously whites-onlyrugby field went off without a hitch.   &quot;We got the field, the bathrooms, everything, back in thesame way we gave it to them,&quot; says Mr. du Plessis, the whitecouncilor. &quot;This type of thing will be a great influence towhites who can't make up their minds. They'll see that thegrass won't die on the rugby field just because blacks playon it.&quot;   M.F. Londt, a Conservative who runs a general store, needsmore convincing. He believes a non-racial town is doomed tofail because it goes against the natural order of things. &quot;Wehave an old saying,&quot; he notes. &quot;Each baboon on his own rock.&quot;   Some walls, says Mr. Erasmus, are harder to break downthan others.   Mr. Tiyo, the secretary of the council, lives in a smallmud-brick house in Bontrug. It is dark but for the glow ofone parafin lamp, which illuminates a Nelson Mandela posterand a framed slogan: &quot;Life is Struggle.&quot; Outside, donkeys andgoats pick through a mound of garbage. On the side of thedirt road is a water tap, one of 50 that service 12,000blacks.   &quot;Our people had a bad attitude toward the whites. Wefigured they weren't prepared to accept us, that they justwanted to perpetuate white dominance,&quot; he says. &quot;When we setup the working committee with the whites, people feared thatit was just another way to co-opt us.&quot;   But as promises begin to be fulfilled -- street paving andconstruction of a long-awaited soccer field have started --trust begins to grow.   &quot;Attitudes are changing here, too,&quot; says Vuyani Booysen, ablack youth leader. &quot;Our people feel they are part of theprocess now. They are coming together in street committees todiscuss what they need and what they want to see happen.There is a certain excitement.&quot;   Mr. Finnis lives in a tiny three-room cinderblock house inthe colored area of Bergsig. The television runs off a carbattery. The bathroom is out back.   Though he has lived in the area all his life, he says hehas never felt at home. When he was 10, he recalls, all thechildren were given little South African flags and buttons onRepublic Day. He and his brother proudly wore them into townand were immediately beaten up by a group of white boys.&quot;They said Hotnots {short for Hottentot, a derogatory wordfor coloreds} weren't allowed to wear these things,&quot; Mr.Finnis says.   In 1985, as a young man, he led a revival ofanti-apartheid activism in the Sundays River valley and wasdetained for six months when he tried to organize a consumerboycott. Back then, the white community saw him as adangerous radical and was relieved about his arrest. LastApril, he was again detained during the boycott. But thistime the whites pressed the minister of law and order for hisrelease because he was needed for talks on ending theboycott. He was freed.   &quot;Our fight isn't to be just like white people, but to betreated equally, with respect,&quot; says Mr. Finnis, who works ata Volkswagen plant in Uitenhage, a city 30 miles away. He iswearing a yellow T-shirt that says &quot;the struggle continues.&quot;His next goal, he says, is to get Kirkwood's schools open toall races, and then to have blacks and coloreds buy propertyand open up shops on Main Street once the government scrapsthe Group Areas Act as expected this month. The statutedivides neighborhoods by race.   &quot;There is still much to be done,&quot; he says. &quot;But alreadyour people have a new sense of dignity, of freedom.&quot;   William Cook, the 63-year-old secretary of the BergsigCivic Association, is certainly walking taller. &quot;When I as aman of color enter a shop these days,&quot; he notes, &quot;the verypeople who used to say `Hey, what do you want,' now say `Goodmorning, sir, can I help you.'&quot;   He savors the thought. &quot;It's a wonderful feeling,&quot; hesays.</TEXT></DOC>
