(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A laid-off but still loyal PTL employeetestified today that Jim Bakker truly cared about the contributorshe is accused of fleecing because they were the ones who built hisempire.   Elizabeth Sacco, who answered correspondence at PTL until herlayoff in 1986, testified for the defense today that Bakker wasconcerned about the ministry's ``partners'' _ $1,000 contributorswho were promised free lodging at the Heritage USA theme park inFort Mill, S.C.   ``He wanted them treated fairly and politely,'' she testified.``He said these were the people who built this place.''   Prosecution witnesses in the 3{-week-old trial have testifiedthat many PTL employees were laid off at the same time Bakker andhis wife were receiving six-figure bonuses. But Ms. Sacco continuesto back Bakker.   ``Yes, I do, and I'm proud of it,'' Ms. Sacco said. ``I feelloyalty because I've seen what this man built. A greedy man doesn'thave his hair turn gray in five years. I wouldn't have taken his jobfor $10 million a year.''   Bakker is accused of defrauding his followers by diverting $3.7million so that he could live in high style. If found guilty on all24 counts, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prison andfined more than $5 million.   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter rejected adefense motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that Bakker'sreligious freedom was violated.   ``This is not a case about religion,'' said prosecutor JerryMiller. ``This is a case about lying to people over television andcheating them out of their money. ... This is a case about fraud.''   Earlier Wednesday, prosecutors wrapped up their case, sayingBakker's ministry had oversold partnerships at its hotels.   The jurors saw 3-year-old tapes of ``The PTL Club'' show in whichBakker called the purchase of such time shares ``a deal of alifetime.''   ``We're not here to make money,'' Bakker said. ``I hope mycritics wake up and realize I'd be a fool if I tried to make moneyoff something like this.''</TEXT></DOC>
