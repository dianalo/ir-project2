At the moment, ``we don't anticipate at all that it will land onthe United States,'' says Peg Malloy, a spokeswoman for the FederalEmergency Management Agency. ``But we need to have our act togetherto respond to any catastrophic emergency, so we're coordinating aninter-agency effort right now.''   The planning work has drawn together representatives from theDepartments of Defense, State, Health and Human Services and Energyin addition to the Environmental Protection Agency, the spokeswomanadded.   The various agencies are working to tailor FEMA's general``Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan'' to deal with thepossibility of radioactive satellite pieces being spread across thecountryside, Ms. Malloy said.   The agency's radiological emergency plan was originallydeveloped in the wake of the Three-Mile Island nuclear plantdisaster, she added.   The concern of the planners is a nuclear-powered,ocean-surveillance satellite launched by the Soviet Union lastDecember 12 to keep track of U.S. Navy vessels. The satellite,designated by the Soviets as Cosmos 1900, began its life in spacein a low circular orbit about 160 miles above the earth's surface.   Soviet controllers unexpectedly lost radio contact with thecraft in April and the Russian news agency Tass reported May 11that the satellite could fall to Earth in August or September.   Soviet officials have insisted there is no reason to fearradioactive debris from the spacecraft's re-entry. But according toPentagon officials, the Soviets have apparently been unable toseparate either the nuclear reactor or the fuel section from therest of the satellite _ two common safeguards.   That raises the possibility Cosmos 1900 could re-enter theatmosphere in one piece, meaning it might not burn up completely.That could spread harmful radioactive debris, just as Cosmos 954did over Canada in 1978.   ``At the moment, it's still a one-piece satellite,'' Navy Cmdr.Dugald Gillies, a spokesman for the U.S. Space Command, saidrecently.   The orbit of Cosmos 1900 is continuing to decay and thespacecraft is now under constant surveillance, Gillies said.   ``Re-entry is not imminent,'' he said. ``But the period for arevolution is continuing to decline and it's continuing to come incloser to Earth. We're keeping a close watch on it.''   While the U.S. Space Command is not yet prepared to predict whenthe Russian satellite will re-enter the atmosphere, the EuropeanSpace Agency in Paris said last week it thought the plunge wouldoccur in mid-September.   ``Cosmos 1900 is expected to re-enter around the middle ofSeptember, give or take four weeks,'' the agency said in astatement. ``Only a few days before the satellite re-enters can theentry location be predicted.   ``Until then, experts can only say that Cosmos 1900 willre-enter somewhere between latitudes 65 degrees north and 65degrees south'' _ meaning anywhere in the world between the Arcticand Antarctic Circles.   ``It's not coming down as fast as originally anticipated, butit's coming down,'' added Ms. Malloy.   Should Cosmos 1900 fall within U.S. borders, FEMA will have anemergency response team ready, she said.   The size and composition of the response team will depend upon avariety of factors, including whether the satellite debris isradioactive and where it lands, she said.   The Soviet Union has launched more than 30 nuclear-poweredsatellites over the years and in at least two cases, radioactivedebris from such satellites has fallen to the Earth's surface.Besides the crash of Cosmos 954 over Canada in 1978, the nuclearcore of Cosmos 1402 splashed into the Indian Ocean in 1983.</TEXT></DOC>
