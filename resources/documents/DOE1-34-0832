A project in Northern Ontario,by Chapleau Co-generation, is described. The project utilizes wood wastefrom a local sawmill, produces steam for sale to the mill, and powerto accomodate all local energy needs. The opportunity for investors anddevelopers to operate co-generation energy from waste plants is discussed.As in the case of the Chapleau project, government assistance was unavailable,and economic benefits are brought to the region. The advantages of cogenerationare its financial viability a market available for its output, and powertechnology for its development. Consideration is also given to the limitedscale of energy produced by waste plants, and the quality and supplyof fuel for waste cogeneration.</TEXT></DOC>
