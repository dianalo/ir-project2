Among this class of machines, look for a shiftfrom 16-MHz to 20-MHz SX processors, bigger hard disks, a price erosion offrom $500 to $1,000, and weight reductions that will put the leading-edgemachines closer to 10 pounds than 15.andP;  You'll also see a few more colorportables for the well-heeled.andP;  Right now, color on pioneering machines fromNEC and Sharp adds about $2,500 to their price, and frankly, the color isn'tbreathtaking.andP;  In addition, the feature remains an AC-only option.andP;  Real,affordable color may have more to do with 1992-93 technology than 1991.andM;NOTES ON NOTEBOOKSandM;The first serious DOS-based notebook PC was the Toshiba T1000 in 1987.andP;  Whenevery other portable weighed at least 10 pounds, the T1000's 6 pounds was arevelation.andP;  This minimalist machine, with its pokey 4.77-MHz 80C88 CPU, asingle 720K floppy disk drive, and a non-illuminated 3- by 10-inch CGAdisplay, cost $1,748 with a 768K RAM disk card.andP;  Still in production, you canfind it today at a street price of less than $600.andM;In October 1988, NEC unveiled a technological tour de force, the disklessUltraLite: 4.4 pounds (now down to 4.1), with a 9.83-MHz V-30(8086-compatible) processor, a 2MB RAM disk, an illuminated 4- by 8-inchdisplay, a ROM card slot, a built-in 2,400-bps modem, and a 1.5- by 12- by8-inch size, for $2,999.andP;  But compromises and tradeoffs made the UltraLitemore of an image leader than a sales leader.andP;  To transfer files to other PCs,you needed to buy and connect an external floppy disk drive or use acantankerous file-transfer program.andP;  If you left the UltraLite unplugged formore than a week, you risked losing your RAM disk files as the batterydrained.andM;In 1989, Toshiba modernized the T1000 concept with a bigger, backlit screenand a faster 9.54-MHz 80C86 processor.andP;  The emerging machine, the T1000SE,weighs 6 pounds and costs $1,699.andP;  But it was Compaq that lit a fire underthe notebook market last October with the Citizen-built LTE and LTE/286.andO;Scaled exactly to the size of a stack of notebook paper--2 by 11 by 8.5inches--and weighing 7 pounds, the LTE provides two disk drives to Toshiba'sone.andM;Currently, the state of the art is represented by the new Sharp PC-6220.andO;Measuring 1.5 by 11 by 8.5 inches and weighing 4.5 pounds, it uses a 12-MHz286 and includes a dazzling 6- by 8-inch VGA screen that displays 16 shadesof gray.andP;  The Sharp (and the identical Texas Instruments TravelMate 2000) hasjust one drive, a 20MB hard disk.andP;  The floppy disk drive is a $299 slide-onoption.andM;Among makers of notebook PCs, opinion varies sharply as to what features youmust include--and how much you can leave out without annoying the customer.andO;NEC, Sharp, and Toshiba believe there is a market for ultrasmall, ultralightmachines with single drives (or no drives other than nonvolatile RAM disks).andO;Compaq represents the opposite camp, saying that customers won't settle for aportable without a floppy disk drive.andM;If market share is the judge, Compaq knows best.andP;  Buoyed by the phenomenalsuccess of the sales-leader LTE and LTE/ 286, Compaq today controls (by oneindustry estimate) 60 percent of the market for DOS portables, against 20percent for Toshiba and a bit under 10 percent for NEC.andP;  That representsmajor progress for Compaq, treading water for Toshiba, downtimes for NEC, andlo, how the mighty have fallen&quot; for Zenith, which used to control more than25 percent of the market.andP;  Other major market shareholders: IBM, Sharp, andTandy/GRiD.andM;PALM-SIZE PCsandM;If you want a system even smaller than the Sharp PC-6220 at 4.5 pounds,you're in the market for a hand-held or &quot;palmtop&quot; DOS work-along like theCasio B.O.S.S., the Atari Portfolio, or the Sharp Wizard.andP;  These provideadequate functionality for many users.andP;  Hint: Look for QWERTY keyboards.andO;ABCD keyboards just don't cut it.andM;Another evolving area in ultralight, ultraportable computing is the categorycalled (pick a term) notepad, slate, workslate, or pen PC computer.andP;  See JimSeymour's column in this issue (&quot;The 'Slate PC' Wave Is About To Break&quot; for adiscussion of the market potential for the hardware and technology beingdeveloped by Data Entry Systems, GRID Systems, Go, IBM, MicroSlate,Microsoft, Momenta, Slate, Sony, and SuperScript.andM;Basically, to build a slate PC, you pour computer circuitry into anEtch-A-Sketch, add a writing stylus, and compose beyond-state-of-the-artcharacter-recognition software.andP;  Many of these systems will be non-DOSmachines intended for specialized applications.andP;  They're most likely tocomplement PCs and laptops, not compete with them.andP;  Slates will be used byservice-industry personnel who now work with pencil and paper or withexpensive hand-held terminals.andP;  A second, perhaps sexier market will be forexecutive notepads.andM;Be warned: handwriting recognition is still lousy except for blockcharacters.andP;  But so what? Many applications will involve choosing from listspresented on-screen; there'll be little handwriting involved.andP;  What's comingalong more rapidly is shape recognition.andP;  Draw something that looks like adunce cap when your slate PC is in architectural mode and your slate willrecognize that you've drawn a cone.andP;  Draw a line parallel to one side of thecone, put an arrowhead at each end, block-print &quot; 20mm&quot; atop the line, andyour slate will auto-dimension the edge of the cone.andP;  Using this technique,you can give any shape the proper proportions.andM;KEY FEATURESandM;Here's a summary of features to consider as you read the reviews and plotyour buying plans.andP;  The features table details the specifics of each portableand notebook-style unit.andM;*  Video.andP;  Settle for nothing less than VGA.andP;  Double-scan CGA (640 by 400pixels) on Toshiba's notebooks is a poor second choice.andM;You can't overstate the importance of multiple gray scales for crisp images;the best video controllers display 16 shades of gray.andP;  Sharp is a leaderhere.andM;Arguably the best display among these machines is the Toshiba T3100SX's 6-by8-inch low-power gas plasma display.andP;  Toshiba and Twinhead let you run anexternal display without disabling the screen on your portable, which isgreat if you use your system to run demos.andP;  To save space, some notebookportables have no provisions for connecting an external monitor.andP;  You decidewhether that's a problem.andM;*  Size and weight.andP;  Don't worry too much about one or two extra pounds orinches among the portables.andP;  The difference is not all that significant.andM;Among notebook machines, the smaller you go, the greater the compromises.andO;Compaq's 8.5 - by 11-inch LTE/286 has a smallish screen and four awkwardlyplaced cursor keys; Toshiba's 11- by 12-inch T1200XE provides a bigger screenand eight properly placed cursor keys.andP;  To get its PC-6220 down to 4.5pounds, Sharp jettisoned the floppy disk drive and made some of the I/Oconnectors nonstandard.andM;*  Mass storage.andP;  The 10-ounce, 2.5-inch hard disks from Conner Peripherals,JVC, and PrairieTek constitute a core technology found in the currentgeneration of notebook PCs.andP;  These disk drives are limited to 20MB now, with40MB expected at year's end.andP;  (That's why you can't get 40MB on the smallestnotebook PCs right now, if they use single-platter 2.5-inch hard disks; thisis not a conspiracy on the part of the makers.) They are also fast, typicallywith an access time of 25 milliseconds.andP;  Dual-platter 2.5-inchers do provide40MB, with 80MB en route; they'll enable the downsizing of today's 15-pounddo-everything portables to 10 pounds within the next year.andM;Compaq currently holds the leader's role among purveyors of multiplatter3.5-inch disk drives, thanks to the breathtaking Conner-built 19-millisecond60MB and 120MB disks on the Compaq SLT 386s/20.andM;All floppy disk drives now are 1.44MB 3.5-inch high-density units, which readand write 720K disks perfectly.andP;  You are not likely to see any more laptopswith 2.5-inch floppy disk drives anytime soon, based on Zenith's misadventurelast year with the MinisPort.andM;*  Expansion units.andP;  According to NEC, half of all buyers of high-endportables opt for docking stations, also called expansion units or expansionstations.andP;  These cost $ 1,000 to $1,500.andM;The best expansion units are click-and-run affairs that provide configurationinformation, so your portable automatically knows about the hard disk, tapedrive, 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, high-resolution video card, networkadapter, and modem in the expansion unit.andP;  These are especially popular whena company settles on one brand of portable for all its business travelers andoutside sales force.andP;  The traveling user brings a portable into the office,finds an open desk with a docking station, snaps the portable in place, andties into the company's computing resources in less than 30 seconds.andM;*  Connectivity.andP;  If you want to tie into a network, you can buy Ethernet,Token-Ring, and other adapters for most portables from the vendor or thirdparties.andP;  In some cases, the network card fits in the modem slot, so you canuse either the network or a modem but not both.andP;  Alternatively, you can plugyour network card into a docking station, use a parallel-port network adaptersuch as Xircom's, or piggyback onto a desktop PC's network connection with azero-slot LAN such as Traveling Software's DeskLink or Artisoft's LANtastic/Z.andP;  (For details on that idea, see  Zero-Slot LANS,&quot; PC Magazine, April 24,1990.)andM;Last year it appeared that some companies were going to build proprietaryexpansion slots common to their lines to encourage third-party developers.andO;Now, they're backsliding.andP;  NEC, for instance, has omitted the ProSpeed 286and ProSpeed SX LTX slot from its pending ProSpeed SX/20.andM;For more on connecting your portable with the outside world, see  PortableProductivity: Communications and Connectivity,&quot; PC Magazine, May 15, 1990.andO;For information on fax modems useful with portables, see the sidebar &quot;FaxModems: The External Connection&quot; in our August 1990 issue.andM;*  Batteries, power, and power conservation.andP;  Regrettably, there is still norevolutionary new power source that will double or triple battery runningtime.andP;  Most progress comes in the form of lower power consumption.andM;Every portable dims the display and spins down the hard disk after a fewminutes of inactivity.andP;  Several provide a deep-sleep or standby mode thatlets you go away for lunch with minimal drain on the battery.andP;  Better stillis instant resume (Toshiba calls it AutoResume), which saves your session tononvolatile RAM, or sometimes to the hard disk.andP;  When you hit this button toturn your unit off, you can be up and running again in a second or two,rather than the minute or two required to perform a cold boot and reload yourprogram and data files from disk.andM;Virtually all portables have quick-change batteries.andP;  If you want more timeaway from the power line, just buy extra batteries.andP;  Some batteries rechargein 2 to 3 hours; others still require an overnight charge.andP;  Several vendorssell external chargers that keep multiple spares topped up at all times.andM;In all cases, be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions forprolonging battery life.andP;  With nickel cadmium batteries, that means lettingthem fully discharge before recharging; otherwise they develop &quot;memory&quot; andquit working before they should.andM;Buying tip: If you regularly carry your portable between two office sites, orbetween home and office, buy a second transformer and keep one in eachlocation.andM;By the way, just about every portable today runs on both 110 and 220 volts,so you can take your machine anywhere in the world.andP;  A handful of portablesoffer 12-volt adapters to let you work in your car or boat.andM;*  Keyboard.andP;  Most machines have industry-standard .75 -inch key spacing now,with 10 or 12 function keys across the top.andP;  Some have only four cursor keys,forcing you to hit Fn and an arrow key for PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End.andP;  Nonehave separate numeric keypads (you can hit NumLock and temporarily use theright half of the alpha pad), but most offer plug-in numeric keypads ($100 to$150) for number crunchers.andP;  Some also provide connectors for externalkeyboards.andM;Of course, there are differences in keyboard feel among the machines, butchoosing one is a subjective call.andM;*  Caveat emptor.andP;  When you compare prices, make sure you're looking atcomparably equipped systems.andP;  Add $100 if DOS isn't included with the system.andO;Occasionally, a battery-capable portable comes only with the AC transformer,or with only one one of two batteries.andP;  This may also affect the weight themanufacturer quotes.andM;Carry cases typically are extra.andP;  So are modems.andP;  External floppy disk drivesfor no-floppy-disk portables (such as the units from Sharp and TexasInstruments) will usually cost extra.andM;REVIEW CRITERIAandM;To be included in this review, a portable PC had to meet the criteria of whatwe believe are the two most significant DOS-to-travel categories: abattery-powered 386 CPU, with no weight restriction, or a battery-powered 286unit weighing no more than 8.5 pounds.andP;  The computers had to be new machines(not reviewed in our special issue on portables, March 13, 1990) and had tobe available to buyers at the beginning of this summer.andM;We expected the 386 units to be SX machines, but we didn't discriminate whenZenith opted for a standard 386 DX CPU.andP;  We also reevaluated two Editor'sChoice portables: the Compaq LTE/286, which, with the 8086-based LTE, definedthe notebook market, and the Toshiba T3100SX, which we consider the best SXportable.andM;Setting the weight ceiling for notebook PCs at 8 pounds was no arbitrarydecision.andP;  We believe that a notebook starts to lose its go-anywhere appealonce it pushes beyond 6 pounds, but the market sees the heaviest of the 286notebook units--the Compaqs and Toshibas--as the leaders.andP;  Note thatToshiba's T1200XE began life at 7.9 pounds, but with a newer, denser battery,it weighs a shade over 8 pounds.andM;We asked vendors to provide machines outfitted the way they would be used inbusiness, with 2MB of memory, their best modems, carrying cases, and all theaccessories, including docking stations.andM;The Sharp PC-6220 and Texas Instruments TravelMate 2000 are reviewed togetherbecause they are the same machine, designed by Sharp and built by TexasInstruments.andP;  The TI has a different case than the Sharp and includes ahandful of extra utilities.andP;  We suspect the biggest difference is that TIwill attract sales from people who want to Buy American.andP;  Don't laugh; itwill happen.andP;  Also expect to see the same machine pop up under additionallabels, for instance as the CompuAdd Companion (with a street price of$2,895).andM;JUST MISSEDandM;More than a dozen battery-powered portables shipped too late for testing byPC Labs.andP;  They include: Airis  (VH-286), Altima (NSX), American Mitac  (LT386SX), CompuAdd (316SL and Companion), Commax (Excell LT-386SX), Dataworld,GoldStar, Hyundai, Leading Edge, NEC (ProSpeed SX/20, UltraLite 286V), Tandon(LT-SX), and Top PCs (LT5600).andP;  In addition, NEC was unable to provide forreview its 16-MHz ProSpeed SX, which was announced in March.andM;The Airis VH-286 has the most exciting specs: the price is $1,895 for a6-pound, 12-MHz 286 with 2MB RAM, a 20MB hard disk (but no internal floppydisk drive), a backlit 11-inch VGA display, and a 2,400-bps modem.andP;  You canuse either line current or a rechargeable battery, or you can drop in tenstandard C-cell batteries for a claimed 12-hour battery life.andP;  Engineered inChicago by a group of Zenith veterans, the Airis is planned strictly as amail-order machine.andP;  It was to have shipped in spring, but financing problems(not uncommon to start-ups) pushed the schedule back to late summer or earlyfall.andM;NEC's ProSpeed SX/20 has a 20-MHz 386SX processor, 1MB RAM (5MB maximum),40MB hard disk, 1.44MB floppy disk drive, VGA display, removable keyboard,&quot;intelligent reconfiguration &quot; when connected to an NEC docking station, anda tentative $5,999 list price.andP;  Its weight including battery is 12.6 pounds.andM;NEC also just missed our deadline with its UltraLite 286V, which looks likethe fatter big brother of the familiar NEC UltraLite.andP;  In fact, that's whatit is: 1.7 by 12 by 9 inches and 6.5 pounds (versus the UltraLite's 1.4 by11.75 by 8.25 inches and 4.1 pounds).andP;  The 286V includes 1MB RAM (expandableto 2MB or 5MB), a 20MB hard disk, and a VGA display.andP;  The $3,999 price willinclude an external 1.44MB floppy disk drive, but the 2,400-bpsmodem-standard on the Ultra-Lite-will now be optional.andM;NEC retains the ROM card slot in the 286V, an odd decision because only a fewapplications were ever published, and most of those are woefully out of date.andO;In addition, NEC acknowledges that it is likely to shift to a new,incompatible ROM card on future products, as agreed during an industryconclave in Japan this May. Yet NEC will continue to market the originalUltraLite, reducing its price from $2,999 to $1,999 for a 2MB unit.andM;BUYING CONSIDERATIONSandM;What's the best portable for you? If this unit is going to be your only PC,you need lots of CPU power and a sizable hard disk.andP;  Look to one of theSX-powered portables reviewed here.andP;  Also check the machines previouslyreviewed in our issue of March 13, 1990, particularly two of our Editor'sChoices, the battery-powered Toshiba T3100SX and Dell 316LT.andM;If you don't need battery power, you'll find additional choices among AC-onlyportables, including 20- to 25-MHz 386 power, internal slots, and sometimes aseparate numeric keypad.andP;  Best of the bunch: the IBM PS/2 Model 70 386 (20MHz), Toshiba T5200/100 (20 MHz), and Dolch P.A.C.andP;  386-25C (25 MHz), allEditor's Choices in March.andP;  Also check out the new Zeos 386SX Portable:$2,195 (street price) for a 12-pound, 4- by 14- by 15-inch AC-only machinewith 1MB RAM and a 42MB hard disk.andM;If you have your heart set on a full-size 286 portable, keep your eyes openfor ongoing price reductions and rebates.andP;  Rather than reducing the listprice of a machine that will be discontinued in six months, the vendor oftenslaps on a  200 to $500 rebate.andM;If you want low-power, semiportable computing for next to nothing, you canexpect even greater closeout deals on 12-to 15-pound 8088/8086 portables.andO;With a 20MB hard disk, the price should be around $ 1,000.andP;  Just don't planto do much beyond light word processing or electronic mail.andM;Our favorite light-duty notetakers are the Toshiba T1000SE and T1000XE,8086-based 6-pounders with a single hard disk and floppy disk drive, for$1,699 and $2,699, respectively.andP;  With its recent  500 price reduction, theCompaq LTE begins to look a bit more reasonable ($2,999 with a 20MB hard diskand a 1.44MB floppy disk drive).andP;  Now that the NEC UltraLite is only $1,999list, it's a great deal if you can live without a floppy disk drive.andP;  Justremember to recharge it weekly whether you use it or not.andM;EDITOR'S CHOICEandM;*  PC-6220 (80286)andM;*  TravelMate 2000 (80286)andM;*  Compaq SLT 386s/20 (80386SX)andM;*  Toshiba T3100SX (80386SX)andM;Four products stand out among the 14 battery-powered notebook and portablePCs we reviewed.andP;  Of the four 12-MHz 80286 notebooks, the Sharp PC-6200 andTexas Instruments' TravelMate 2000 represent significant advances in trulyportable computing.andM;Among the 15-pound 386SX-based portables, the Compaq SLT 386s/20 packs themost power yet in a battery-operated PC, and the Toshiba T3100SX, meanwhile,has the best display.andM;The Sharp and TI notebooks are marvels of efficiency, with many of the samespecs: a 20MB hard disk, an 8- by 6-inch VGA display with 16 shades of gray,a weight of 4.4 pounds, an 11- by 8.5-inch footprint.andP;  They suffer from onesignificant design compromise: no internal floppy disk drive.andP;  We stronglyrecommend the $299 external drive option, which clips onto the right side andadds 1.4 pounds.andP;  The machine is also replete with options, such as afax/data modem, math coprocessor, and a five-hour battery pack, if you don'tmind the extra weight.andP;  The Texas Instruments version has a different caseand utilities, but otherwise it's the same package.andM;If you must have both a hard disk and a floppy disk drive in your notebookPC, you'll be satisfied with either the Compaq LTE/286 or the ToshibaT1200XE.andP;  The Compaq is smaller and lighter and offers a 40MB hard disk inplace of Toshiba's 20MB, but the small CGA screen is ill proportioned, andthe cursor-key layout is the worst among all portables reviewed.andP;  WhileToshiba strains the upper boundary of notebook computing at 8.5 pounds, youdo get an 8-by 5-inch CGA screen and eight cursor keys.andP;  Both of these unitsdeserve honorable mention.andM;For overall performance, Compaq's rugged SLT 386s/20 stands alone, thanks tothe 20-MHz SX processor and 4K memory cache, 60MB hard disk (with 120MBoptional), and detachable keyboard, as well as a sophisticatederror-correcting modem as an option.andP;  As on the LTE/286, the quality of the8-by 6-inch VGA display is merely adequate, which is disappointing for anotherwise impeccable machine.andP;  If you opt for either of these Compaq machines(the LTE/286 is currently the best-selling portable), you can expect to payseveral hundred dollars more than for the next-most-expensive portable.andM;The dazzling 8-by 6-inch, 16-gray-scale gas plasma display on the 16-MHzToshiba T3100SX makes this the best demo machine, especially since you canrun the display and a monitor simultaneously.andP;  In addition, Toshiba'sexcellent power conservation features extend battery life beyond three hours.andO;We can reasonably expect Toshiba to introduce a 20MHz SX version in shortorder to keep up with Compaq.andM;As for the Editor's Choices in our previous portable roundup (March 13,1990), we're still comfortable with the 386 and 386SX choices: the Dell316LT, an affordable battery-powered 16-MHz SX unit; the Dolch P.A.C.andO;386-25C, a husky, speedy 25-MHz AC-only lunchbox; the IBM PS/2 Model P70 386,a 20-MHz AC-only lunchbox; the Toshiba T3100 SX, with its 16-MHz processor;and the Toshiba T5200/100, a 20-MHz AC-only clamshell portable.andM;We chose two 8088/8086-based notebook units in March and conditionallycontinue to recommend them.andP;  The condition: they're for light-duty tasks.andP;  Ifyou can live without a hard drive or floppy disk drive, the 4-pound NECUltraLite is an attractive machine, with its price dropped by $1,000 to$1,999, and the 6-pound, single-floppy-drive Toshiba T1000SE also bearsinvestigation.andM;Five 286-based battery-powered portables were Editor's Choices in March, butwe now recommend that you choose a 386SX.andM;If you do opt for a 286, watch for price reductions, rebates, and closeouts,which can save you an extra $500.andM;MNP, CCITT, V-DOT-22-BISS,, AND LAP-M:andM;Won't Somebody Please Speak English?andM;Understanding the industry jargon will help you get the right modem for yourportable PC.andM;Progress is a mixed blessing.andP;  Updated technology in communications hardwaremeans fewer errors, increased throughput, and more terminology to comprehend.andO;Here's a crash course in modem terminology: all you need to know to make aninformed buying judgment now that you have multiple choices in laptop modems.andM;*  Speed.andP;  CCITT V.22bis, usually shortened to V.22bis and pronounced&quot;V-dot-22-biss, &quot; means your modem runs at 2,400 bits per second  bps) or2,400 baud.andP;  V.32 means 9,600 bps.andP;  Bell 212A and V.22 (with no bis) are1,200-bps standards.andM;Suggestion: Say 2,400 bps, not Vdot-22-biss.andP;  Everyone knows what you mean.andO;Technically, the baud rate is not the same as bits per second, but the onlypeople who lose sleep over this are equally horrified to see I kilobyterounded off to 1,000 bytes.andP;  Rule of thumb: To tell how fast the modem runs,divide the bps by 10.andP;  A 2,400-baud (sorry, 2,400-bps) modem runs at about240 characters per second.andM;*  Data compression.andP;  Squeeze the volume out of your transmission and youdouble or quadruple the effective speed.andP;  MNP 5 is today's standard (up to2:1 compression), and CCITT V.42bis (4:1) is where it's headed.andP;  Modems canhave both; it's not an either/or situation.andM;By the way, MNP stands for Microcom Networking Protocol.andP;  CCITT is theacronym for a long French phrase that means &quot; International Phone StandardsCommittee.&quot;andM;*  Error correction.andP;  Modems with no error correction are the most common,but MNP 4 is where it's at, and V.42 is the future.andP;  The main V.42 errorcorrection protocol is called LAP-M; V.42 also includes MNP 4 errorcorrection.andP;  MNP 5 is sometimes described as error correction (&quot;I've got anMNP 5 error-correcting modem&quot;) because MNP 5 (data compression) includeslower NM classes like MNP 4 (error correction).andM;Buying hint: A modem may. be described as V.42 compatible or V.42 compliant.andO;The terms sound the same but V.42 compliant is better.andM;*  Fax.andP;  Some modems also support Group III fax, which is what the faxmachine in your office understands.andP;  The fax terminology is called V.29, butjust say Group III.andM;Some modem fax devices are outbound only, which is no great loss; incomingfaxes devour disk space, and viewing them on a computer screen is an exercisein frustration.andP;  The sane choice: Use a normal modem and public e-mailservices (CompuServe, MCI, Western Union) to send text-only faxes on theroad.andP;  Have inbound faxes sent to a fax machine at your hotel or remote worksite.andM;CARRY-ALONG COMMUNICATIONSandM;The most common modem on a portable today is an asynchronous Hayes-compatible2,400-bps (V.22bis) unit with fallback to 1,200/300 bps, no error correction,and no data compression; it works pretty well most of the time.andP;  If you'rebuying one, however, you should get at least a 2,400-bps modem with MNP 5,which is supported by public e-mail services and corporate dial-up LANS.andO;Better yet, get one with MNP 5 (compression), plus V.42bis (compression) andV.42 (correction).andP;  Your new modem will automatically negotiate with anyother modem and use all the protocols available at both ends; you don't lifta finger.andM;Among die portables reviewed here, the best modem is available for the CompaqSLT 386s/20: $599 list for V.22bis (2,400 bps); V.42bis and KM 5 (datacompression); V.42, LAP-M, and MNP 2-4 (error correction); various 300-and1,200-bps fallback modes; and a synchronous mode that lets you talk tomainframes.andP;  The GRID 1450sx also has a modem that understands correction andcompression better than most.andM;If your portable doesn't have the modem you want, look into the portableexternal modems and fax boards from Touchbase Systems  (516) 261-0423) andThe Complete PC  (408) 434-0145).andP;  To extend the life of your plain-vanillamodem, you can add MNP 4 and 5 as a software layer with MTE communicationssoftware ($79 from MagicSoft, (708) 953-2374).andM;OUR CONTRIBUTORSandM;Bill Howard is executive editor of PC Magazine.andM;Wendy Dugas-Perez is PC Labs' project leader for the PCs team.andM;Bruce Brown, Bill O'Brien, andandM;Alfred Poor are contributing editors of PC Magazine.andM;Fredric Burke, Robert Kendall, and Salvatore P.
