The bank-holding company's $60 million pretax charge may indicate that some banks holding loans to Mexico could be willing to accept less than 50 cents on the dollar under a debt-exchange plan announced last week. Since the unveiling of the debt-exchange program, some other regional banks have said they would accept as little as 50 cents on the dollar. If they accept steeper discounts, it could put money-center banks in a more difficult position.    NCNB said its write-off will reduce fourth-quarter net income by $36 million, or 44 cents a share. The Charlotte, N.C.-based company said it would report fourth-quarter earnings of about $12 million to $15 million, or 13 cents to 16 cents a share, compared with $45.9 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier.    As previously reported, Mexico and the U.S. government last week agreed to a plan that would allow Mexico to issue as much as $10 million in bonds backed by U.S. Treasury securities. Banks would bid for the bonds by offering their Mexican loans, accepting some discount to face value.    An NCNB spokesman wouldn't say how much the company would bid in the debt-swap auction, but he said NCNB intends to participate. The 56% write-down &quot;serves as an estimate. It's our best guess,&quot; he said. &quot;It means we will be aggressive in the auction.&quot;    Regional banks are considered more able to take big losses on their Mexican loans than the more heavily exposed money-center banks.    NCNB said the charge wouldn't materially affect its capital position.    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, NCNB shares rose $1.125 to close at $18.375.    Separately, NCNB said it allocated $54 million to reserves for losses on $105 million in loans to developing countries other than Mexico. The move doesn't affect earnings because the $54 million was shifted from a pool of loan-loss reserves that wasn't specifically allocated.    The spokesman for NCNB said its strategy has been to &quot;aggressively reduce NCNB's exposure&quot; to loans to developing countries. The company sold its entire portfolio of Chilean loans in 1986, and did the same thing with its Argentine loans in the third quarter of 1987.    The company yesterday said it expects to report 1987 earnings of $164 million to $167 million, or $2 to $2.03 a share, compared with $199 million, or $2.53 a share, a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
