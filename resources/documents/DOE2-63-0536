With use of a specially-designed penetration and optical fiberbundle and optical fiber cables featuring superior heat resistivity andradiation resistivity, our equipment allows direct insertion into thevacuum vessel of JT-60. It is furthermore applicable to the light transmissionin hyper-vacuum. This report describes the outline of design, manufactureand installation of the light transmission equipment for JT-60.</TEXT></DOC>
