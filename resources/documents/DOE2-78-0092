<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0092 </DOCNO><TEXT>An automatic governor station has been developed to efficiently countergas supply load fluctuations depending on the season and time. The systemperforms various functions, including (a) automatic pressure controlaccording to memorized patterns, (b) special pressure correction thatallows reservations to be made on each site concerning temporary pressurerises and falls, (c) the automatic/manual closing of the cut-off valve,and (d) concentrated monitoring. Each site is provided with a monitoringcontrol signal relay panel equipped with a governor controller. Thispanel is connected to the control center via a special-purpose NTT lineand protected by using an uninterruptive power supply device. The pipingis of the dual type. Even though the governor controller fails, secondarypressure control is possible by telecontrol. Monitoring functions forgas leakage, a power failure, and a CPU failure are also available. Anoperational suitability test has revealed good results. (4 figs, 2 tabs,1 ref)</TEXT></DOC>
