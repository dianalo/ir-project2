Until airlines changed to a new winter timetable last Sunday,rights to fly the Berlin route were closely restricted to theairlines of the victorious World War II Allies.   You could fly to Berlin from London, Paris, Moscow and a fewother European cities outside Germany. Pan Am had four New Yorkflights a week. Otherwise, Berlin was an international air-trafficdeadend, though for isolated West Berlin its air routes were atreasured bridge across Communist East Germany.   The German flag carrier, Lufthansa, was founded in Berlin in1926 but could not fly to the city, frozen out by the specialrights given to the United States, Britain, France and the SovietUnion as occupying powers of the divided city.   A typical long-haul journey to Berlin would mean changing planesin Frankfurt, often to Pan Am, which had the lion's share ofFrankfurt-Berlin traffic.   No more. The Allies' special privileges ended on Oct. 3 when thetwo Germanys united. Lufthansa paid Pan Am $150 million for itsdomestic German operations, and last Sunday Lufthansa made itsfirst Berlin flight in 45 years.   The German airline has plastered the city with ads saying``We're home again,'' and now offers nonstop flights from Berlin toTokyo, Moscow and Newark, N.J., serving New York.   Airlines from other countries, including Iberia, Alitalia,Singapore Airlines, Swissair and El Al are shouldering into theBerlin market.   But last Sunday, a surprise job action disrupted the galawelcomes laid on for a raft of new international flights. ThirteenPan Am pilots who were supposed to be flying Lufthansa flightscalled in sick.   Lufthansa spokesman Peter Hoebel said four flights had to becanceled and 40 were delayed as the airlines struggled to deal withthe unexpected difficulty.   Tegel airport was chaotic. Some passengers waited hours forbaggage, several flights had to share the same departure lounge,and access roads were jammed with double-parked cars left by peoplewaiting for delayed passengers.   ``We sent a message to New York, asking Pan Am to work on theproblem,'' Hoebel said, ``and the next day the pilots were suddenlywell again.''   Hoebel said the pilots were all Americans who have settled inGermany and want to be taken over into Lufthansa as Pan Am cabincrew workers were. But they were not part of the takeover deal andPan Am must eventually find other jobs for them, the Lufthansaspokesman said.   For the time being, the pilots are flying old Boeing 727s in PanAm colors under Lufthansa flight numbers, but Lufthansa plans tostop using the 727s next year.   Despite the startup confusion, Lufthansa sees a great future forBerlin as an air-travel hub and expects it to grow to equalFrankfurt, Germany's busiest, Hoebel said.   But the city suffers a lack of capacity even with three airportscurrently in operation, and there are only vague plans to build anew airport south of the city. Environmental issues are expected tocomplicate the choice of a site for a major airfield.   Meanwhile, the former western sector of Berlin has Tegel airportas the main international flight center and Tempelhof forshort-haul flights. In former East Berlin, Schoenefeld airport isin operation for long-haul flights.   The Soviet airline Aeroflot, formerly restricted to Schoenefeldin the east, has started daily flights to Moscow from Tegel in thewest. Lufthansa has gone the other direction, basing some of itsflights in Schoenefeld.</TEXT></DOC>
