Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas warned that ``a dreadful wave ofrevenge, repression and witch hunting may follow'' may follow theguerrilla withdrawal. The attorney general said Rivera Damas and aRoman Catholic auxiliary bishop should leave El Salvador for theirown safety.   About 800 mourners attended the burial of six Jesuit priests andtwo others who were slain and mutilated early Thursday at theirresidence at Jose Simeon Canas Central American University.   The United States has pressed rightist President AlfredoCristiani for a full investigation of the killings. In Washington,Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., warned Sunday that U.S. aid to ElSalvador could be curtailed if Cristiani cannot control right-wingdeath squads from operating in the country.   There was virtually no gunfire in the capital as troops regainedcontrol of the working-class districts of Zacamil and Metropolis onthe north side and Mejicanos in the northeast.   The guerrillas, however, retained their grip on parts ofSoyapango, a working class suburb to the east of the capital, andsoldiers said there had been fighting throughout the day. Fourhelicopter gunships were rocketing the area at dusk.   Around the capital, army patrols moved through the shatteredstreets, strewn with the rubble of fighting. On some streets,several burned bodies could be seen.   Later Sunday, security troops raided a small church in thecapital haboring refugees from the fighting.   A military news release gave a tentative count of nearly 1,000soldiers and guerrillas killed since the rebels launched theirnationwide offensive Nov. 11.   The military said 784 guerrillas were killed, 527 wounded and129 captured and government forces lost 208 killed and 627 wounded.   Radio Venceremos, the Farabundo Marti National LiberationFront's clandestine radio station, claimed 827 soldiers were killedor wounded but gave no breakdown.   Neither side gave an estimate of casualties among civilians, whosuffered heavily in the block-by-block fighting. The Red Cross saidan estimate was difficult because many bodies are still in thestreets.   About 800 mourners gathered for the burial of six Jesuitpriests, their cook and her teen-age daughter, who were slainThursday and their bodies mutilated. Cristiani and U.S. AmbassadorWilliam Walker was among those who attended the funeral Mass.   Rivera Damas said before the service that ``there exists thevehement presumption that the murders were committed by members ofthe armed forces or people in intimate connivance with them.''   Later, in his regular Sunday homily, Rivera Damas called therebel offensive ``useless and unjustifiable'' and said the militaryresponse was ``excessive.''   He said with the guerrilla withdrawal ``a dreadful wave ofrevenge, repression and witch hunting may follow.''   Rivera Damas was asked about a letter sent by Attorney GeneralMauricio Colorado to Pope John Paul II asking that some bishops beremoved from El Salvador for their own safety. Colorado claimed thebishops were fomenting violence.   The archbishop said he did not have the text of the letter,which was published by Sunday newspapers, but added, ``Certainly, Ihave received some terse threats.''   Colorado said he sent the letter as a private citizen. Hementioned no names in the letter but told reporters Sunday that hewas referring to Rivera Damas and auxiliary bishop Gregorio RosaChavez. Colorado claimed he had information ``confirming there is aplan to attempt against (the lives) of these church dignataries.''   They could be assassinated by any ``resentful person,'' Coloradosaid.   ``Monsignor Rosa Chavez has participated, even his brothers arepart of the guerrillas, which is known by everyone and MonsignorRivera Damas have expressed some controversial and veryobjectionable opinions ... and this places them at gave risk,'' headded.   Members of Cristiani's right-wing Republican NationalistAlliance have frequently criticized Jesuit priests as beingsympathetic to the rebels.   At the Vatican, the pope told thousands of people in St. Peter'sSquare that the world was viewing ``with profound apprehension thetragic events'' in El Salvador.   He said the Jesuit priests ``were barbarically assassinated''and that many other innocent people were killed in the``fratricidal fighting.'' He made no mention of Colorado's appeal.   In San Salvador, many pharmacies and food stores were open forthe first time in a week. They were crowded by customers, many ofwhom had been trapped in their homes and neighborhoods during thefighting.   An estimated 40,000 people in San Salvador's population of 1million fled the battle zones during the offensive.   Many occupied soccer stadiums, schools and Red Cross and churchshelters with little food or water.   As they returned to damaged or destroyed homes they pokedthrough the ruins for possessions, trying to ignore bodies lyingnearby.   In Mejicanos, a man searched through his damaged home, hisburned car parked nearby.   ``This is over now,'' he said. ``The guerrillas came, and thenthe army came and they shot from helicopters and look at what theydid!'' He declined to give his name, fearing reprisal.</TEXT></DOC>
