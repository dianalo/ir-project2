Today's action proposes treatmentstandards and prohibition effective dates for these wastes, as well asfor some of the wastes listed in andSection;andSection; 268.10 and 268.11 (FirstThird and Second Third), and for two newly listed wastes. The Agency alsois proposing prohibition effective dates for these wastes when they areinjected into deep underground wells regulated under 40 CFR 148. If theseproposed actions are finalized, Third Third wastes can be land disposedafter the applicable effective dates if the respective treatment standardsare met, or if disposal occurs in units that satisfy the statutory no migrationstandard.The Agency is also proposing certain interpretations of general applicability.The most important of these involve: implementation of the dilution prohibition;whether wastes formerly excluded by the Bevill Amendment are to be considerednewly identified or listed for purposes of the land disposal restrictions;applicability of California list prohibitions to Third Third wastes thatreceive national capacity variances; and applicability of the Californialist prohibitions to newly identified or listed wastes. EPA is also proposingto clarify the scope of paragraphs (c) and (d) of 40 CFR 261.33 (commercialchemicals that are hazardous wastes when discarded) due to the possiblelack of clarity that became apparent in the course of establishing treatmentstandards for these wastes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Comments on this proposed rule must be submitted on or beforeJanuary 8, 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> The public must send an original and two copies oftheir comments to EPA RCRA Docket (OS-305), U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Summary of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 and theLand Disposal Restrictions Framework <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Statutory Requirements </ITAG>The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA), enacted on November 8,1984, prohibit the land disposal of hazardous wastes. Specifically, theamendments specify dates when particular groups of hazardous wastes areprohibited from land disposal unless ``. . . it has been demonstrated tothe Administrator, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that there willbe no migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit or injectionzone for as long as the wastes remain hazardous'' (RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1),(e)(1), (g)(5); 42 U.S.C. 6924 (d)(1), (e)(1), (g)(5)). Congress establisheda separate schedule for restricting the disposal by underground injectionof solvent and dioxin-containing hazardous wastes, wastes referred to collectivelyas California list hazardous wastes (RCRA section 3004(f)(2), 42 U.S.C.6924(f)(2)), and soil and debris resulting from Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) sections 104 and 106response actions, and RCRA corrective actions when the soil and debriscontains listed spent solvent, dioxin, and California list hazardous wastes.The amendments also require the Agency to set ``. . . levels or methodsof treatment, if any, which substantially diminish the toxicity of thewaste or substantially reduce the likelihood of migration of hazardousconstituents from the waste so that short-term and long-term threats tohuman health and the environment are minimized'' (RCRA section 3004(m)(1),42 U.S.C. 6924(m)(1)). Wastes that meet treatment standards establishedby EPA are not prohibited and may be land disposed. In addition, a hazardouswaste that does not meet the treatment standard may be land disposed providedthe ``no migration'' demonstration specified in RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1),(e)(1) and (g)(5) is made. For the purposes of the restrictions, HSWA defines land disposal ``. .. to include, but not be limited to, any placement of such hazardous wastein a landfill, surface impoundment, waste pile, injection well, land treatmentfacility, salt dome formation, salt bed formation, or underground mineor cave'' (RCRA section 3004(k), 42 U.S.C. 6924(k)). HSWA defines landdisposal to include underground injection wells; therefore, disposal ofhazardous wastes in injection wells is subject to the land disposal restrictions.The land disposal restrictions are effective when promulgated unless theAdministrator grants a national capacity variance from the otherwise-applicabledate and establishes a different date (not to exceed two years beyond thestatutory deadline) based on ``. . . the earliest date on which adequatealternative treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity which protects humanhealth and the environment will be available'' (RCRA section 3004(h)(2),42 U.S.C. 6924(h)(2)). The Administrator may also grant a case-by-caseextension of the effective date for up to one year, renewable once forup to one additional year, when an applicant successfully makes certaindemonstrations (RCRA section 3004(h)(3), 42 U.S.C. 6924(h)(3)). A case-by-caseextension can be granted whether or not a national capacity variance hasbeen granted. The statute also allows treatment of hazardous wastes in surface impoundmentsthat meet certain minimum technological requirements (or certain exceptionsthereto). Treatment in surface impoundments is permissible provided thetreatment residues that do not meet the treatment standard(s) (or applicablestatutory prohibition levels) are ``. . . removed for subsequent managementwithin one year of the entry of the waste into the surface impoundment''(RCRA section 3005(j)(11)(B), 42 U.S.C. 6925(j)(11)(B)). In addition to prohibiting the land disposal of hazardous wastes, Congressprohibited storage of any waste which is prohibited from land disposalunless ``. . . such storage is solely for the purpose of the accumulationof such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate properrecovery, treatment or disposal'' (RCRA section 3004(j), 42 U.S.C. 6924(j)).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Applicability to Injected Wastes </ITAG>As noted above, disposal of hazardous wastes in injection wells is subjectto the provisions of HSWA. The injection of hazardous wastes is controlledby two statutes, RCRA and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The regulationsgoverning injection of these wastes have been codified along with otherregulations of the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program under theSDWA in parts 124, 144, 145, 146, 147, and 148 of the Code of Federal Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Solvents and Dioxins </ITAG>Effective November 8, 1986, HSWA prohibited land disposal (except by deepwell injection) of solvent-containing hazardous wastes numbered F001-F005listed in 40 CFR 261.31 and dioxin-containing hazardous wastes numberedF020-F023 and F026-F028 (RCRA sections 3004 (e)(1), (e)(2), 42 U.S.C. 6924(e)(1), (e)(2)). On November 7, 1986, EPA promulgated a final rule (51FR 40572) implementing RCRA section 3004(e). This rule established thegeneral framework for the land disposal restrictions program, and establishedtreatment standards for the F001-F005 solvent wastes and F020-F023 andF026-F028 dioxin-containing wastes. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. California List Wastes </ITAG>Effective July 8, 1987, the statute prohibited further land disposal (exceptby deep well injection) of the following listed or identified wastes (RCRAsection 3001) set out in RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1) and (d)(2) (42 U.S.C.6924 (d)(1), (d)(2)): (A) Liquid hazardous wastes, including free liquids associated with anysolid or sludge, containing free cyanides at concentrations greater thanor equal to 1,000 mg/1. (B) Liquid hazardous wastes, including free liquids associated with anysolid or sludge, containing the following metals (or elements) or compoundsof these metals (or elements) at concentrations greater than or equal tothose specified below: (i) arsenic and/or compounds (as As) 500 mg/ (ii)cadmium and/or compounds (as Cd) 100 mg/l; (iii) chromium (VI and/or compounds(as Cr VI)) 500 mg/l; (iv) lead and/or compounds (as Pb) 500 mg/l; (v)mercury and/or compounds (as Hg) 20 mg/l; (vi) nickel and/or compounds(as Ni) 134 mg/l; (vii) selenium and/or compounds (as Se) 100 mg/l; and(viii) thallium and/or compounds (as Tl) 130 mg/l. (C) Liquid hazardous waste having a pH less than or equal to two (2.0).(D) Liquid hazardous wastes containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)at concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm. (E) Hazardous wastes containing halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) intotal concentration greater than or equal to 1,000 mg/kg. On July 8, 1987, EPA promulgated a final rule (52 FR 25760) implementingRCRA section 3004(d). This rule established treatment standards for Californialist wastes containing PCBs and certain HOCs, and codified the statutoryprohibition on liquid corrosive wastes. The statutory prohibition is ineffect for the California list wastes containing free cyanides, metals,and the California list dilute HOC wastewaters. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Disposal of Solvents, Dioxins and California List Wastes in InjectionWells </ITAG>Section 3004(f) of RCRA required that the Administrator prohibit the disposalof solvents, dioxins and California List wastes in deep wells, effectiveAugust 8, 1988, unless such disposal had been determined to be protectiveof human health and the environment for as long as the wastes remainedhazardous, or unless a variance had been granted under RCRA section 3004(h).On July 26, 1988, the Agency established effective dates for the prohibitionon injection of solvents and dioxin wastes (53 FR 28118). In another regulation,effective August 6, 1988 and published August 16, 1988 in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>the Agency established effective dates for theprohibition on injection of California List wastes (53 FR 30908). <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Scheduled Wastes </ITAG>HSWA required the Agency to prepare a schedule by November 8, 1986 forrestricting the land disposal of all hazardous wastes, including undergroundinjected wastes, listed or identified as of November 8, 1984 in 40 CFRpart 261, excluding solvent- and dioxin-containing wastes and Californialist wastes covered under the schedule set by Congress. The schedule, basedon a ranking of the listed wastes that considers their intrinsic hazardand their volume, ensures that prohibitions and treatment standards arepromulgated first for high volume hazardous wastes with high intrinsichazard before standards are set for low volume wastes with low intrinsichazard. The statute further requires that these determinations be madeby the following deadlines: (A) At least one-third of all listed hazardouswastes by August 8, 1988; (B) at least two-thirds of all listed hazardouswastes by June 8, 1989; and (C) all remaining listed hazardous wastes andall hazardous wastes identified as of November 8, 1984, by one or moreof the characteristics defined in 40 CFR part 261 by May 8, 1990. Furthermore, if EPA failed to set a treatment standard by the statutorydeadline for any hazardous waste in the first third or second third ofthe schedule, the waste was required to be disposed in a landfill or surfaceimpoundment that met the minimum technological requirements specified inRCRA section 3004(o) for new facilities (RCRA section 3004(g)(6)). (NOTE:In the August 17, 1988 First Third final rule, EPA interpreted the term``such facility'' in section 3004(g)(6) to refer to the individual surfaceimpoundment or landfill unit.) In addition, prior to disposal, the generatorwas required to certify to the Administrator that he had investigated theavailability of treatment capacity and had determined that disposal insuch landfill or surface impoundment was the only practical alternativeto treatment currently available to the generator. This restriction onthe use of landfills and surface impoundments applied until EPA set a treatmentstandard for the waste, or until May 8, 1990, whichever was sooner. Theserequirements are collectively referred to as the soft hammer provisions.Other forms of land disposal, including underground injection, were notsimilarly restricted, and could continue to be used for disposal of untreatedwastes until EPA promulgated a treatment standard, or until May 8, 1990,whichever was sooner.If the Agency fails to set a treatment standard for any scheduled hazardouswaste by May 8, 1990, the soft hammer provisions are superseded by thehard hammer. These wastes are automatically prohibited from all forms ofdisposal on May 8, 1990, unless the wastes are the subject of a successful``no migration'' demonstration (RCRA section 3004(g)(5), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(5)).(Note: RCRA section 3004(h)(2) permits extensions of the effective datesuch as national capacity extensions or case-by-case extensions beyondthe hard hammer date.)On May 28, 1986, EPA promulgated the schedule for setting treatment standardsfor the listed and identified hazardous wastes (51 FR 19300). All wastesthat are identified as hazardous by characteristic are scheduled in theThird Third, as required by RCRA. This schedule is incorporated in 40 CFR268.10, 268.11 and 268.12.For the scheduled wastes, the statute does not provide different deadlinesfor restriction of wastes that are injected underground versus disposedof in surface land units. The Agency did, however, propose and promulgateFirst Third regulations for surface disposed and injected wastes on separatedates. The First Third final rule, promulgated on August 8, 1988 and publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31138), set out theconditions under which wastes included in the first one-third of the scheduleof restricted hazardous wastes listed in 40 CFR 268.10 may continue tobe land disposed (other than by injection). Final regulations prohibitingdeep well injection of certain First Third wastes were published on August16, 1988 (53 FR 30908) and on June 14, 1989 (54 FR 25416).The Second Third final rule, promulgated on June 8, 1989 and publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 23, 1989, (54 FR 26594) established treatmentstandards and prohibition effective dates for land disposal and undergroundinjection for certain wastes included in 40 CFR 268.11. In addition, treatmentstandards and effective dates for certain First Third soft hammer wastes,Third Third wastes and newly listed wastes were promulgated.Today's notice proposes the conditions under which wastes included in thethird one-third of the schedule of restricted hazardous wastes, listedin 40 CFR 268.12, may continue to be land disposed including disposal inunderground injection wells. Treatment standards for some restricted hazardouswastes listed in andSection;andSection; 268.10 and 268.11 (First Third andSecond Third wastes) and two newly listed waste (<T3>i.e.,</T3> listed after November 8, 1984) are also proposed.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Newly Identified and Listed Wastes</ITAG>RCRA requires the Agency to make a land disposal prohibition determinationfor any hazardous waste that is newly identified or listed in 40 CFR part261 after November 8, 1984 within six months of the date of identificationor listing (RCRA section 3004(g)(4), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(4)). However, thestatute does not provide for an automatic prohibition of the land disposalof such wastes if EPA fails to meet this deadline. Today's notice proposestreatment standards for two newly listed wastes (see section III.A).B. Regulatory FrameworkBy way of preface, we note that the following description of existing rulesis for the readers' convenience, and is not intended to reopen any of theserules for public comments. The November 7, 1986 final rule (51 FR 40572)established the regulatory framework for implementing the land disposalrestrictions program. Some changes to the framework were made in the July8, 1987, final rule (52 FR 25760) that prohibited the land disposal ofCalifornia list wastes, as well as in the August 17, 1988 final rule. Someadditional changes are also being proposed in today's rule. Regulationsspecifying how the framework applies to injected wastes were promulgatedJuly 26, 1988 (53 FR 28118). The following discussion summarizes the majorprovisions of the land disposal restrictions framework.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Applicability</ITAG>The land disposal restrictions apply prospectively to the affected wastes.In other words, hazardous wastes land disposed after the applicable effectivedates are subject to the restrictions, but wastes land disposed prior tothe effective dates are not required to be removed or exhumed for treatment(51 FR 40577). Similarly, only surface impoundments receiving restrictedwastes after the applicable deadline are subject to the restrictions ontreatment in surface impoundments contained in 40 CFR 268.4 and RCRA section3005(j)(11). Also, the storage prohibition applies to wastes placed instorage after the effective dates.The provisions of the land disposal restrictions apply to wastes producedby generators of greater than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per calendarmonth, as well as small quantity generators of 100 to 1,000 kilograms ofhazardous waste (or greater than 1 kilogram of acute hazardous waste) ina calendar month. However, wastes produced by small quantity generatorsof less than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste (or less than l kilogramof acute hazardous waste) per calendar month are conditionally exempt fromRCRA, including the land disposal restrictions (see 40 CFR 268.1).The land disposal restrictions apply to all facilities subject to RCRA,including both interim status and permitted facilities. The requirementsof the land disposal restrictions program supersede 40 CFR 270.4(a), whichcurrently provides that compliance with a RCRA permit constitutes compliancewith subtitle C of RCRA. Therefore, even though the requirements may notbe specified in the permit conditions, all permitted facilities are subjectto the restrictions.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Treatment Standards</ITAG>By each statutory deadline, the Agency must establish the applicable treatmentstandards under 40 CFR part 268 subpart D for each restricted hazardouswaste (RCRA section 3004(m)(1)). After the applicable effective dates,restricted wastes may be land disposed in subtitle C facilities only ifthey meet the treatment standards. If EPA does not promulgate treatmentstandards by the statutory deadlines, such wastes are prohibited from landdisposal (with the exception of First Third and Second Third scheduledhazardous wastes, which are subject to the soft hammer provisions of RCRAsection 3004(g)(6) until May 8, 1990).A treatment standard is based on the performance of the best demonstratedavailable technology (BDAT) to treat the waste (51 FR 40578). EPA may establishtreatment standards either as specific technologies or as performance standardsbased on the performance of BDAT technologies. Compliance with performancestandards may be monitored by measuring the concentration level of thehazardous constituents (or in some circumstances, indicator pollutants)in the waste, treatment residual, or in the extract of the waste or treatmentresidual. When treatment standards are set as performance levels, the regulatedcommunity may use any technology not otherwise prohibited (such as impermissibledilution) to treat the waste to meet the treatment standard. Treaters thusare not limited to only those technologies considered in determining thetreatment standard. However, when treatment standards are expressed asspecific technologies, such technologies must be employed.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. National Capacity Variances from the Effective Dates</ITAG>The Agency has the authority to grant national capacity variances fromthe statutory effective dates, not to exceed two years, if there is insufficientalternative protective treatment, recovery or disposal capacity for thewastes (RCRA section 3004(h)(2)). To make capacity determinations, EPAcompares the nationally available alternative treatment, recovery, or protectivedisposal capacity at permitted and interim status facilities which willbe in operation by the effective date with the quantity of restricted wastegenerated. If there is a significant shortage of such capacity nationwide,EPA will establish an alternative effective date based on the earliestdate such capacity will be available. During the period such a capacityvariance is in place, if the waste is disposed in a landfill or surfaceimpoundment, such disposal may be made only in a unit meeting the minimumtechnological requirements of RCRA section 3004(o) (53 FR 31186 and 40CFR 268.5(h)(2)). It should be noted, however, that if a waste subjectto a national capacity variance is treated to meet the applicable treatmentstandard, it may be disposed in a Subtitle C landfill or surface impoundmentregardless of whether the unit meets minimum technological requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Case-By-Case Extensions of the Effective Dates</ITAG>The Agency will consider granting up to a one-year extension (renewableonly once) of a prohibition effective date on a case-by-case basis. Therequirements outlined in 40 CFR 268.5 must be satisfied, including a demonstrationthat adequate alternative treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity forthe petitioner's waste cannot reasonably be made available by the effectivedate due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, and that thepetitioner has entered into a binding contractual commitment to constructor otherwise provide such capacity. During the period that such a case-by-caseextension is in place, the waste may be land disposed only in a unit meetingthe minimum technological requirements of RCRA section 3004(o).<ITAG tagnum="81">5. ``No Migration'' Exemptions from the Restrictions</ITAG>EPA has the authority to allow the land disposal of a restricted hazardouswaste which does not meet the treatment standard provided that the petitionerdemonstrates that there will be no migration of hazardous constituentsfrom the disposal unit or injection zone for as long as the waste remainshazardous (40 CFR 268.6). If a petition is granted, it can remain in effectfor no longer than ten years for disposal in interim status land disposalunits, and for no longer than the term of the RCRA permit for disposalin permitted units (40 CFR 268.6(h)).Section 148.20 of 40 CFR (promulgated on July 26, 1988, see 53 FR 28118)outlines in detail the Agency's plan for implementing the ``no migration''provisions of RCRA with respect to injected wastes. Briefly, a petitioneris required, through modeling, to demonstrate that there is no migrationof hazardous constituents from the injection zone for as long as the wasteremains hazardous. This demonstration can be made in one of two ways: theuse of flow and transport models to show that injected fluids will notmigrate vertically out of the injection zone for a period of 10,000 years;or, use of geochemical modeling to show that the waste is transformed soit will become nonhazardous at the edge of the injection zone. Also, ashowing must be made that the well was in compliance with the substantivearea of review, corrective action, and mechanical integrity requirementsof part 146.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Variances from the Treatment Standards</ITAG>EPA established the variance from the treatment standard to account forthose wastes that cannot be treated to meet the applicable treatment standards,even if well-designed and well-operated BDAT treatment systems are used(40 CFR 268.44). This variance is somewhat analogous to the fundamentallydifferent factors variance in the Agency's Clean Water Act effluent limitationsguidelines regulation. Among other things, petitions must demonstrate thatthe waste is significantly different from the wastes evaluated by EPA inestablishing the treatment standard, and the waste cannot be treated tothe level or by the method specified by the treatment standard, or thatsuch standard or method is inappropriate for the waste (51 FR 40605). Thisvariance procedure can result in the establishment of a new treatabilitygroup and corresponding treatment standard that applies to all wastes meetingthe criteria of the new waste treatability group. A site-specific variancefrom the treatment standard may also be granted administratively (withoutrulemaking), but the variance has no generic applicability to other wastesat other sites (53 FR 31199).<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Exemption for Treatment in Surface Impoundments</ITAG>Wastes that would otherwise be prohibited from one or more methods of landdisposal may be treated in a surface impoundment that meets certain technologicalrequirements (40 CFR 268.4(a)(3)) as long as treatment residuals that donot meet the applicable treatment standard (or statutory prohibition levelswhere no treatment standards are established) are removed for subsequentmanagement within one year of entry into the impoundment and are not placedinto any other surface impoundment. The owner or operator of such an impoundmentmust certify to the Regional Administrator that the technical requirementshave been met and must also submit a copy of the waste analysis plan thathas been modified to provide for testing treatment residuals in accordancewith section 268.4 requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Storage of Prohibited Wastes</ITAG>Storage of prohibited wastes is prohibited except where storage is solelyfor the purpose of accumulating sufficient quantities of wastes to facilitateproper treatment, recovery, or disposal (40 CFR 268.50). A facility thatstores a prohibited waste for more than one year bears the burden of proofthat such storage is solely for this purpose. <T3>Id.</T3> EPA bears the burden of proof if the Agency believes thatstorage of a restricted waste by a facility for up to one year is not forthe purpose of accumulating sufficient quantities to facilitate propertreatment, recovery, or disposal. <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">9. The ``Soft Hammer'' Provisions</ITAG>First Third and Second Third wastes for which EPA has not promulgated treatmentstandards may continue to be disposed in landfill and surface impoundmentunits until May 8, 1990, or until EPA promulgates treatment standards,whichever is sooner. Such land disposal may occur only if certain demonstrationsare made, and provided the landfill or surface impoundment units meet theminimum technology requirements of RCRA section 3004(o) (see 53 FR 31181,August 17, 1988). Other types of land disposal are not similarly restricted.On May 8, 1990, those wastes for which EPA has not established treatmentstandards are prohibited from land disposal and underground injection (thehard hammer provision). On May 8, 1990, therefore, the soft hammer provisionswill no longer be in effect for the First, Second, or Third Third wastes.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Today's Proposed Rule</ITAG>Today's notice describes the Agency's proposed approach to implementingRCRA Section 3004(g) requirements with respect to certain listed and identified(<T3>i.e., </T3>characteristic) hazardous wastes included in 40 CFR 268.10-268.12.The Agency is required to promulgate regulations establishing conditionsunder which the Third Third wastes included in andSection; 268.12 may beland disposed by the statutory deadline of May 8, 1990. Today's noticeis the fifth rulemaking promulgated by the Agency in response to Congress'1984 HSWA mandate.A. Applicability of Proposed Treatment StandardsToday the Agency is proposing treatment standards and effective dates forall Third Third wastes (<T3>i.e., </T3>those wastes included in 40 CFR 268.12) (see section III.A.2).The Agency is also proposing treatment standards and effective dates forall First and Second Third soft hammer wastes (currently subject to therequirements of 40 CFR 268.8), and for two newly listed wastes. The treatmentstandards being proposed today will apply to wastes that are land disposed(including those that are injected into deep wells).In previous rulemakings, the Agency amended the schedule so that certainFirst and Second Third wastewater residues, derived-from wastes (<T3>i.e., </T3>multi-source leachate), and mixtures of hazardous/radioactivewastes were moved to the Third Third of the schedule (see 53 FR 31214,andSection; 268.12(b), (c), and (d); 54 FR 8264; and 54 FR 26648, andSection;268.12(b) and (c)). The Agency today is proposing treatment standards forthese wastes. In addition, the Agency is proposing treatment standardsfor two newly listed wastes (<T3>i.e., </T3>a waste listed after enactment of the Hazardous and SolidWaste Amendments of 1984) that fall into the F002 and F005 waste codes.In the Second Third rulemaking, the Agency solicited comments, data, andspecific suggestions regarding the regulation of lab packs. In today'srule, the Agency is proposing alternative treatment standards expressedas specified technologies for certain lab packs as a separate treatabilitygroup.In the Second Third proposed rule, the Agency also solicited data and commentson the options and approaches that were being considered for establishingBDAT treatment standards for characteristic wastes. In today's rule, theAgency is proposing treatment standards for wastes that exhibit one ormore of the characteristics.B. Applicability of Today's Proposed Rule to Class I-H Hazardous WasteInjection Wells Regulated Under 40 CFR 148The Agency has, on occasion, proposed and promulgated regulations and effectivedates for underground injected hazardous wastes covered under RCRA sections3004 (f) and (g) separately from regulations addressing wastes disposedin surface facilities. EPA is addressing all methods of land disposal ofwastes in today's proposal, including injection wells regulated jointlyunder the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and RCRA.C. Characteristic WastesIn today's rule, EPA is proposing treatment standards for those wasteswhich exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: ignitability,corrosivity, reactivity or EP toxicity (40 CFR 261.21-24). EPA today isproposing methods of treatment for some characteristic wastes, and concentrationlevels for others. For certain characteristic wastes, EPA is proposingto require treatment below the level at which the waste ceases to exhibitthe particular characteristic. A detailed discussion of these issues isprovided in section III.C.D. Proposed Treatment Standards for Multi-Source LeachateOn February 27, 1989, the Agency amended the schedule for prohibiting hazardouswastes from land disposal by placing multi-source leachate derived fromhazardous waste in the Third Third (see 54 FR 8264). The Agency took thisstep to study more fully the most appropriate treatment standards for suchleachate. The Agency's original approach to multi-source leachate was thatthe leachate carries the waste codes of all of the listed hazardous wastesfrom which it is derived and, therefore, is subject to the prohibitionsand treatment standards for those wastes. In the event a particular constituentin the leachate is present in more than one prohibited waste, the strictertreatment standard applies (53 FR 31138, August 17, 1988).Today the Agency is proposing two options for the development of treatmentstandards for multi-source leachate: (1) Continued application of the treatmentstandards developed for the underlying wastes from which the leachate isderived; or (2) establishment of one set of wastewater standards and oneset of nonwastewater standards which would apply to all multi-source leachate.The Agency is specifically requesting comment on these two options.A detailed discussion of the proposed options for the development of treatmentstandards for multi-source leachate is contained in section III.A of today'sproposed rule.E. Mixed (Hazardous/Radioactive) WastesEPA is proposing to grant a two-year national capacity variance under section3004(h)(2) for mixed hazardous/radioactive wastes subject to today's rulemaking.The Agency bases the proposed national variance for these wastes upon adetermination that there is inadequate treatment capacity available forthese wastes. The Agency is continuing to evaluate the volumes, characteristics,and treatment options for such wastes. A detailed discussion of EPA's approachfor mixed wastes subject to today's rulemaking is provided in section III.Dof today's proposed rule.F. Applicability of Today's Proposed Rule to Mineral Processing WastesSection 3001(b)(3)(A)(ii) of RCRA excludes from the hazardous waste regulations(pending completion of studies by the Agency) solid wastes from the extraction,beneficiation and processing of ores and minerals. On September 1, 1989,EPA published a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 36592) that narrowed the scope of thistemporary exclusion as it applies to mineral processing operations to 25enumerated wastes that meet the exclusion criteria of ``high volume/lowhazard,'' as specified in the September 1 rule. EPA determined that fivespecific mineral processing wastes clearly remain within the scope of theexclusion, and that 20 additional specified mineral processing wastes remainwithin the exclusion pending collection of further volume and hazard data.All previously excluded mineral processing wastes, other than these 25specified wastes, that exhibit one or more of the characteristics of hazardouswaste will no longer be excluded from the hazardous waste regulations whenthe final rule becomes effective. (On September 25, 1989 (see 54 FR 39298-39318),EPA proposed to remove an additional 7 of these wastes from the exclusionbased on additional volume and/or hazard data.)EPA believes that the wastes withdrawn from the exclusion are ``newly identified''for the purposes of these provisions. Although technically the wastes arenot being identified by a new characteristic, they are being brought intothe subtitle C system after the date of enactment of the HSWA on November8, 1984. The Agency is proposing that these newly identified mineral processingwastes not be subject to the BDAT treatment standards proposed today forcharacteristic hazardous wastes. A detailed discussion is provided in sectionIII.E.G. Proposed Alternative Treatment Standards for Lab PacksThe Agency received many comments concerning the applicability of the landdisposal restrictions to lab packs in response to previous rulemakings.The Agency maintains that these wastes cannot be exempt from the statutoryrequirements, since the plain language of the statute includes them, andthere is no indication in the legislative history to exclude them fromthe land disposal restrictions if they contain prohibited wastes. In theSecond Third final rule, however, the Agency solicited further comment,data, and specific suggestions to support treatment options for lab packsand modifications to the notification and certification requirements.The Agency is today proposing alternative treatment standards for lab packsthat contain certain organic constituents, and is specifying incinerationas the treatment standard for these wastes. The Agency is also proposingstabilization as an alternative treatment standard for lab packs that containcertain inorganic constituents. The Agency believes that the proposed approachprovides some of the administrative relief sought by the commenters, andminimizes the risks posed by land disposal of these small volumes of hazardouswaste. Section III.A of today's proposed rule provides a detailed discussionof the alternate requirements for lab packs.H. Nationwide Variances From the Effective DateDue to lack of sufficient treatment or recovery capacity, EPA is proposinga national capacity variance for soil and debris contaminated with someof the waste codes covered by today's notice. EPA also is proposing a two-yearnational capacity variance for certain wastes disposed by deep well undergroundinjection.Such determinations are based on a comparison of the volumes of wastesrequiring treatment to the amount of capacity available for such treatment(see section III.B). Although EPA does not require that BDAT technologiesbe used to meet the applicable treatment standards, unless otherwise specified,EPA assesses available capacity by evaluating the availability of technologiesidentified as BDAT.The Agency is proposing to grant a two-year national capacity variancefor the surface-disposed and deep well-injected hazardous wastes, and mixedhazardous/radioactive wastes listed in the following tables:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 1._<T4>Summary of Proposed</T4> 2-<T4>Year National Capacity Variance for Surface-Disposed Wastes</T4><H1>Required alternative treatment technology</H1><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Physical form</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Combustion of sludge/solids <D>\1\ D001 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>\2\ Leachate </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Incineration followed by Mercury retorting <D>\3\ D009 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>P065 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>P092 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury retorting <D>\4\ D009 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>K071 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>K106 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>U151 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Thermal recovery <D>\5\ D006 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>P015 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"/><D>P073 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>P087 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Vitrification <D>D004 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>D010 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"/><D>K031 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"/><D>K084 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"/><D>K101 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"/><D>K102 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"/><D>P010 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"/><D>P011 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"/><D>P012 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"/><D>P036 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"/><D>P038 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"/><D>P103 </D><D>Nonwastewater </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>P114 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>U136 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>U204 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>U205 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Wet-air oxidation <D>F019 </D><D>Nonwastewater. </D><F>\1\ D001 (Ignitables). </F><F>\2\ Multi-source Leachate. </F><F>\3\ D009 (Organo-Mercury). </F><F>\4\ D009 Inorganic Mercury). </F><F>\5\ D006 (Cadmium batteries).</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Summary of Proposed Two-Year National Capacity Variance for UndergroundInjected Wastes </T4><H1>Required alternative treatment technology </H1><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Physical form</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Alkaline chlorination <D>\6\ D003 </D><D>Wastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chemical oxidation followed by chemical precipitation <D>\7\ D003 </D><D>Wastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium reduction followed by chemical precipitation <D>D007 </D><D>Wastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury retorting <D>D009 </D><D>Nonwastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Neutralization <D>D002 </D><D>Wastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Treatment of reactives followed by chromium reduction andamp; chemicalprecipitation <D>\8\ D003 </D><D>Wastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wet-air oxidation <D>K011 </D><P>K013 </P><P>K014 </P><D>Wastewater. </D><P>Wastewater. </P><P>Wastewater.</P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wet-air oxidation followed by carbon adsorption <D>Leachates\9\ </D><D>Wastewater. </D><F>\6\ D003 (Cyanides). </F><F>\7\ D003 (Sulfides). </F><F>\8\ D003 (Explosives, Reactives). </F><F>\9\ Multi-Source Leachate.</F></ITAG></ITAG>I. Best Demonstrated Available Technologies (BDAT)Today's proposed rule defines waste treatability groups by waste code,and identifies the Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT) for eachwaste code within the treatability group (see section III.A.1). Treatmentstandards are based on the performance levels achievable by the BDAT identifiedfor each waste code. Any technology not otherwise prohibited (<T3>e.g.,</T3> impermissible dilution) may be used to meet the concentration-basedtreatment standards. Where treatment standards are expressed as a technology,the waste must be treated using the specified technology prior to landdisposal.J. Determining When Dilution is PermissibleEPA believes that its existing rules regarding impermissible dilution ofprohibited wastes require further clarification when applied to situationsinvolving aggregation for centralized treatment of more than one waste.Therefore, the Agency is today amplifying its interpretation of permissibledilution to clarify that, with respect to prohibited wastes containingBDAT constituents at concentrations exceeding the treatment standard, aggregationfor centralized treatment of such wastes must result in actual reductionin the toxicity or mobility of at least one BDAT constituent in each prohibitedwaste that is centrally treated. In many cases, such a reduction must occurfor more than one BDAT constituent. In addition, given the site-specificnature of the determination, EPA retains its authority to deviate fromthis general principle in individual cases where centralized treatmentis inadequate. A detailed discussion of this clarification is providedin section III.G of today's proposed rule.K. Other Impermissible Dilution IssuesEPA today is proposing that: (1) Impermissible dilution of a waste thatexhibits the characteristic of toxicity be prohibited; (2) impermissibledilution of listed wastes to achieve a delisting level be prohibited; and(3) impermissible dilution of a waste that exhibits the characteristicof ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity be prohibited if EPA has establisheda method of treatment as the treatment standard for the waste. The Agencybelieves that these types of dilution are incompatible with the language,goals, and legislative history of HSWA, where Congress expressed clearintent that dilution not be used as a substitute for treatment standardspromulgated pursuant to RCRA section 3004(m). A detailed discussion ofthese proposed prohibitions on dilution is provided in section III.H oftoday's proposed rule.L. Storage ProhibitionSection 3004(j) provides that storage of prohibited hazardous waste isitself prohibited ``. . . unless such storage is solely for the purposeof the accumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessaryto facilitate proper recovery, treatment or disposal.'' See andSection; 268.50(a)(2),and 51 FR 1709, January 14, 1986. This language applies only to storageof prohibited wastes in non-land based storage units (<T3>e.g., </T3>tanks and containers), land-based storage being a type ofdisposal. The Agency is today soliciting comment on its interpretationthat the storage prohibition does not apply where storage precedes legitimate,protective treatment, recovery or disposal. A detailed discussion of thisinterpretation is provided in section III.I of today's proposed rule.M. Generator Notification RequirementsThe generator notification requirements set forth in 40 CFR 268.7 specifythat when the generator has determined, either through testing or his knowledgeof the waste, that the waste is restricted and does not meet the applicabletreatment standards, the generator must, with each shipment of waste, notifythe treatment facility in writing of the appropriate treatment standards.If the generator has determined that the waste he is shipping is restricted,but can be land disposed without further treatment, he must submit to theland disposal facility the same information, as well as a certificationstating that the waste meets the applicable treatment standards. In today'srule the Agency is considering changing the interpretation of andSection;268.7 to allow referencing the treatment standards. In addition, the Agencyis proposing to amend andSection; 268.7 to allow a one-time notificationand certification for small quantity generator (SQG) shipments subjectto tolling agreements. A detailed discussion of these amendments is providedin section III.J of today's notice.N. Waste Analysis Requirements The Agency today is proposing to incorporate the approach to waste analysispromulgated in the First and Second Third final rules (53 FR 31146 and54 FR 26594). Where BDAT is a destruction or removal technology, a totalwaste analysis is required because it is most appropriate for measuringsuch destruction or removal. The legislative history indicates a strongpreference for treatment that destroys hazardous constituents (see, <T3>e.g., </T3>130 Cong. Rec., S9179, daily ed. July 25, 1984, statementof Senator Chaffee), and the only reliable way to verify that destructionhas occurred is to measure the total waste. Similarly, where BDAT is identifiedas an immobilization technology such as stabilization, analysis of a TCLPwaste extract is required because it is the most appropriate measure ofimmobilization. In cases where both technologies are identified as BDAT,both types of waste analysis are required. In order for the initial generator to determine whether his waste meetsthe applicable treatment standard as generated, he should analyze the wasteextract if a treatment standard is in 40 CFR 268.41, or he should analyzethe total waste if the treatment standard is found in andSection; 268.43(see proposed section 268.35). The generator may also make this determinationbased on his knowledge of the waste (see andSection; 268.7(a)), providedthere is a reasonable basis for doing so (for example, the generator usesso little of a key constituent that it could not be found in the wasteat levels exceeding a treatment standard). The Agency has discussed thisprinciple in past rulemakings, and is not reopening it for comment here.O. Modification to the Framework: Waste Analysis Plans and Treatment/DisposalFacility Testing Requirements Today, the Agency is soliciting comment on proposed revisions to the treatmentand disposal facility testing requirements contained in andSection;andSection;264.13(a), 265.13(a), 268.7(b), and 268.7(c). Currently, the comment containedin andSection;andSection; 264.13(a)(2) and 265.13(a)(2) indicates that theowner/operator of a treatment or disposal facility may rely on the generatorof the hazardous waste to supply part or all of the waste analysis information(provided that this information is sufficient for the treatment or disposalfacility to meet the regulatory requirements imposed by part 268). Thislanguage has been mistakenly construed to preclude requiring the owneror operator of a treatment or disposal facility to conduct a detailed analysisof a representative sample of a waste. The Agency is today seeking commenton the following two approaches that would specify the circumstances underwhich EPA may require testing: (1) The generator may supply the waste analysis information only if anEPA-approved waste analysis plan allows the generator to do so. The Agencyis clarifying that the owner or operator of the treatment or disposal facilitywill be required to conduct this testing unless otherwise stated in anEPA-approved waste analysis plan. The Agency is proposing to amend andSection;andSection;268.7(b) and 268.7(c), the waste analysis requirements under the land disposalrestrictions, to reflect this change; or (2) The owner/operator of the treatment or disposal facility is requiredto test the waste a minimum of once a year. The Regional Administratormay require more frequent testing, through the waste analysis plan, ona site-specific basis.A detailed discussion of the two approaches is provided in section III.K.The Agency is also addressing the testing requirements of wastes treatedin so-called 90-day tanks (or containers). There is a regulatory gap withrespect to treatment of prohibited wastes that is conducted in such tanksor containers regulated under andSection; 262.34. This is because such tanks(or containers) are not subject to a waste analysis plan requirement. Thus,there is presently no regulatory vehicle for determining testing frequencyin such circumstances (although the existing testing requirement obviouslyapplies, and continues to apply, to persons conducting treatment of prohibitedwastes in section 262.34 tanks and containers). In order to close this regulatory gap, EPA is proposing today that personstreating prohibited wastes in section 262.34 tanks and containers mustprepare a plan justifying the frequency of testing that they choose toadopt. A detailed discussion of the proposed requirements is provided insection III.L of today's proposed rule. P. Clarification of ``P'' and ``U'' Solid Wastes The Agency is proposing amendments to the existing language of 40 CFR 261.33to clarify the regulations pertaining to ``P'' and ``U'' hazardous wastes.The first amendment involves andSection; 261.33(c), a provision that listsresidues from containers and inner liners of containers that have heldcommercial chemical products listed in andSection; 261.33 (e). This languageis partially in error, and the Agency is proposing to correct it. EPA isalso proposing a change to clarify when contaminated soil, water, and spilldebris contaminated with 40 CFR 261.33 (e) and (f) materials can be solidwastes. A detailed discussion of the Agency's proposed amendments is providedin section III.F of today's preamble. Q. Applicability of California List Prohibitions After May 8, 1990 With the promulgation of the Third Third final rule, almost all of theCalifornia list prohibitions will be superseded by more specific prohibitionsand treatment standards.\10\<NOTE/> The only continued applicability of the California list appearsto be (1) for liquid hazardous wastes that contain over 50 ppm PCBs; (2)for HOC-containing wastes identified as hazardous by a characteristic propertythat does not involve HOCs, as, for example, an ignitable waste that alsocontains greater than 1000 ppm HOCs (but not an EP toxic waste that exhibitsthe characteristic because it contains one of the six chlorinated organicpesticides covered by the EP toxicity characteristic; and (3) for liquidhazardous wastes that exhibit a characteristic and also contain over 134mg/l of nickel and/or 130 mg/l of thallium. In section III.M of today'sproposal, the Agency is soliciting comment on whether the California listprohibitions should be applicable to newly listed or identified wastesand discusses this option at length.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ See 52 FR 29993 (August 12, 1987) and 52 FR 25773 (July8, 1987); see also 40 CFR 268.32(h) (HOC prohibition superseded by treatmentstandard and effective date for a particular HOC). Also, EPA is restating that the California list prohibitions apply to wasteswhich receive national capacity variances in later rulemakings. This discussionalso appears in section III.M of this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Detailed Discussion of Today's Proposed Rule</ITAG>A. Development and Identification of Treatment StandardsToday's notice proposes treatment standards for the remaining Third Thirdscheduled wastes for which treatment standards have not been promulgated.(Land disposal restrictions were promulgated ahead of schedule for 16 wastesoriginally scheduled in the Third Third: K100 nonwastewaters on August8, 1988 (53 FR 31174, August 17, 1988), clarified on May 2, 1989 (54 FR18836); and K005, K007, K023, K093, K094, P013, P021, P099, P109, P121,U069, U087, U088, U102 and U190 wastes on June 8, 1989 (54 FR 26594, June23, 1989). Details of the development of treatment standards for thesewastes can be found in the First Third and Second Third administrativerecords in the RCRA docket.) Treatment standards are also being proposedfor the remaining First Third and Second Third wastes which are currentlysubject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions of 40 CFR 268.8.Development and identification of the proposed treatment standards arepresented on a waste code basis in sections III.A.2. through III.A.6. oftoday's notice. Section III.A.7. presents the development of proposed treatmentstandards for wastes identified as multi-source leachate and includes areference table for the BDAT list constituents that correspond to a goodportion of the U and P chemicals. This table is a handy reference to thediscussion of the development of standards for these U and P chemicalsand includes: an alphabetical list of the chemicals proposed for regulationin multi-source leachate, their corresponding U or P code (if applicable),and a reference to sections III.A.2. through III.A.6. that presents backgroundon the development of treatment standards for the corresponding U or Pcode.The bulk of the following discussion and that of section III.A.1. has appearedin previous preambles and is being repeated here as an aid to the reader'sunderstanding, not to reopen these issues for comment. (The final paragraphin this section, relating to whether the standards proposed today are belowlevels that minimize threats to human health and the environment is a newdiscussion and is open for comment.)The first step in the development of treatment standards is to divide thewastes to be regulated into groups based on similar physical and chemicalproperties. These waste treatability groups take into account differencesin the applicability and effectiveness of treatment for those particularwastes. The Agency initially decides how wastes should be grouped by examiningwhether the wastes are generated by similar industries or from similarprocesses. This is a valid starting point because the waste characteristicsthat affect treatment performance are expected to be similar for thesewastes even though the wastes themselves are somewhat different.The next step in the development of treatment standards is to identifythe Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT) for each treatabilitygroup. A treatment technology is considered to be ``demonstrated'' primarilybased on data from full-scale treatment operations that are currently beingused to treat the waste (or a similar waste). Once the ``demonstrated''technologies have been identified, the Agency determines whether thesetechnologies may be considered ``available''. To be ``available'' the technologyitself or the services of the technology must be able to be purchased,and the technology must substantially diminish the toxicity of the wasteor reduce the likelihood of migration of the waste's hazardous constituents.EPA notes that it prefers to base BDAT on technologies that further thestatutory goals of waste minimization and recycling. In some circumstancesEPA may select this type of technology as BDAT over more conventional treatment,provided the disparity in performance of the technologies is not too pronounced,and the technology selected minimizes threats to human health and the environmentby substantially diminishing waste toxicity and reducing mobility of toxicconstituents.Treatment data from ``demonstrated'' ``available'' technologies are thenscreened with regard to the design and operation of the equipment, thequality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) analyses of the performance andoperating data, and the accuracy and precision of the analytical testsused to assess treatment performance. After this screening, the treatmentdata are adjusted for each constituent based on the analytical recoveryof that constituent from treatment residuals. The Agency has chosen toperform this adjustment in order to account (in part) for analytical interferencesassociated with the chemical makeup of the treatment residual. Where datafor more than one treatment technology exist, the individual performancedata for each of the various treatment technologies are then statisticallyevaluated. The mean concentrations of constituents in the treatment residualsfrom each technology are compared using an analysis of variance test (referredto as ``ANOVA'') in order to determine if one technology performed significantlybetter than the other. (A detailed discussion of the methodology for identificationof BDAT and the ANOVA test is provided in the November 7, 1986 final rule(51 FR 40572)). Where data exist for only one technology, the Agency usesbest engineering judgement to assess whether that particular technologyrepresents the best applicable technology for that particular waste andwhether the data indicate that the treatment system was well-designed andwell-operated.Once BDAT is identified, EPA establishes the treatment standard as maximumconstituent-specific concentrations allowed in the waste (or in an extractof the treated waste), as a specific technology (or group of technologies),or as combinations of these. Although the statute provides discretion toestablish treatment standards as either levels or methods of treatment,EPA normally attempts to set concentration-based treatment standards wheneverpossible, because this allows the use of other technologies or combinationof technologies that can achieve the same level of performance (as measuredby compliance with these standards). Thus, concentration-based standardsprovide the regulated community some degree of flexibility in choosingtreatment technologies and also allow the investigation and developmentof new and alternative technologies. In addition, establishing concentration-basedstandards provides a means of ensuring that the treatment technologiesare operated at conditions that the Agency has determined will result inthe best demonstrated performance.(Note: EPA is presently studying its response to the Court's remand orderin the land disposal prohibition framework case <T3>(Hazardous Waste Treatment Council</T3> v.<T3> EPA, </T3>No. 86-1657, D.C. Cir. Sept. 15, 1989). Although the Agencyhas not formulated its final response, we are finding for purposes of thisproposal that, based on present knowledge, none of the treatment standardsbeing proposed appear to be below levels where threats to human healthand the environment are minimized. In many cases, the standards being proposedare greater than various standards developed pursuant to less exactingstatutory directives. For example, most of the standards for metals aregreater than, or in the same order of magnitude, as maximum contaminantlevels established pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act, which takeinto account technical feasibility and cost. Other examples include thetreatment standards for polyaromatic hydrocarbons in organic and petroleumrefining wastes that are orders of magnitude higher than risk-based levelsdeveloped for purposes of the Clean Water Act's Water Quality Criteria.For other wastes, the Agency is presently unable to determine with confidenceas to when threats would be minimized because of various uncertaintiessuch as the amount of a carcinogen that can pose a risk, behavior of hazardouswastes in a land disposal environment, extrapolation of animal toxicitydata to human data. Based on the information the Agency at this time viewsthe technology-based standards proposed today as not being below levelswhere threats to human health and the environment are minimized.)<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Applicability of Treatment Standards and Overview of theRemainder of This Preamble Section</ITAG>Section III.A.1. of today's preamble discusses certain general issues arisingfrom developing or applying today's proposed treatment standards. In orderto provide a comprehensive general discussion, sections III.A.1.a. throughIII.A.1.f. restate the Agency's position on certain issues pertinent tothe development of today's proposed treatment standards. The Agency isalso providing a clarification on how treatment standards compare to PracticalQuantitation Limits (PQLs) (see section (III.A.1.e.)), and a clarificationon the use of grab and composite samples for purposes of establishing andenforcing treatment standards (see section III.A.1.f.). The Agency is notreopening these issues for public comment, nor is it here presenting acomplete discussion of these issues (references to previous <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices and background documents will be provided).Sections III.A.1.g. and h. provide overviews of general issues and informationon the applicability of treatment standards to all characteristic (D001through D017) wastes and to all U and P wastes, respectively. Section III.A.1.i.presents procedures the public should follow for requesting copies of additionaldata that the Agency expects to receive during the public comment period,and the reasons that these procedures have been established. <T3>a. Restrictions on the Use of Technologies Identified as BDAT. </T3>Compliancewith a concentration-based treatment standard requires only that the treatmentlevel be achieved; once achieved, the waste may be land disposed in a subtitleC unit. The waste need not be treated by the BDAT technology; in fact,a concentration-based treatment standard provides maximum flexibility inone's choice of treatment technology because any treatment, including recyclingor any combination of treatment technologies, unless prohibited (e.g.,impermissible dilution) or unless defined as land disposal (e.g., landtreatment), can be used to achieve these standards. Some treatment standards in today's proposed rule, however, are expressedas a technology rather than as a concentration-based standard. EPA typicallyestablishes a treatment method as the standard when the Agency has no meansof calculating valid concentration-based standards that can be used forcompliance monitoring. In such cases, that particular technology must beused to treat that particular waste (including any mixture that containsthe waste). After the waste is treated using the specified method it maybe land disposed, unless EPA has specified otherwise in the rule (see forexample, the proposed standard for certain mercury containing wastes),or (in some situations) if the residue exhibits a hazardous waste characteristicand does not meet BDAT for that characteristic. In cases where EPA has specified the use of a technology (or technologies)a generator or treater can, however, demonstrate that an alternative technologycan achieve the equivalent level of performance as that of the specifiedtreatment method (40 CFR 268.42(b)). This demonstration is anticipatedto typically be both waste-specific and site-specific and may be basedon: (1) The development of a concentration-based standard that utilizesa surrogate or indicator compound that guarantees effective treatment ofthe hazardous constituents; (2) the development of a new analytical methodfor quantifying the hazardous constituents (see discussion of analyticalcomplications in establishing concentration-based standards for U and Pwastes in section III.A.1.h.(2) of today's preamble); and (3) other demonstrationsof equivalence for an alternative method of treatment based on a statisticalcomparison of technologies, including a comparison of specific design andoperating parameters. As a result, a new treatment standard based on this demonstration, as wellas any analytical methodology used in the demonstration, could then beproposed to be applicable to other wastes determined to be in the sametreatability group. It should be noted that promulgating standards expressedas specified methods of treatment does not preclude the Agency from establishingconcentration-based standards in the future without receiving specificvariance requests from industry, if adequate data and information becomeavailable through other means. In situations where wastes subject to concentration-based standards aremixed with wastes subject to treatment standards expressed as a method,the mixture must be treated by the specified method and must also meetthe concentration-based treatment standards for any other prohibited wastecontained in the matrix (see generally 53 FR 31146-7, August 17, 1988).<T3>b. Applicability of Treatment Standards to Treatment Residues Identifiedas ``Derived-From'' Wastes and to Waste Mixtures. (1) ``Derived-From''Wastes. </T3>The Agency emphasizes that all residues from treating theoriginal listed F, K, U and/or P wastes are likewise normally consideredto be the listed waste by virtue of the ``derived-from'' rule found in40 CFR 261.3(c)(2). Consequently, all wastes generated in the course oftreatment are prohibited from land disposal unless they comply with thetreatment standard or are otherwise exempted from the prohibition, suchas, through a no-migration petition or by a capacity variance. Treatment operations including those identified as BDAT, typically generatewastewater and nonwastewater residuals that may require further treatment.For example, incineration generates two residues, ash and scrubber waters.In order to comply with the treatment standards, the ash may need to bestabilized in order to immobilize the metal constituents that have concentratedin the ash. In addition, subsequent treatment of the scrubber waters maygenerate additional inorganic residues that may contain metals that werecaptured in the scrubber water. Thus, these inorganic residues may alsoneed to be stabilized prior to land disposal, in order to comply with thesame treatment standards as the stabilized ash. (Note: The Agency has nottested every possible waste that may result from every subsequent partof the treatment train. However, since the treatment standards proposedtoday are generally based on treatment of a relatively concentrated formof the waste (i.e., the ``original'' waste), the Agency believes that residuesfrom subsequent treatment are less difficult to treat.)The ``derived-from'' rule does not apply to wastes that are identifiedas hazardous solely because they exhibit a characteristic of hazardouswaste (see 40 CFR 261.3(d)(1)). Once these characteristic wastes are treatedin compliance with today's proposed treatment standards (and in accordancewith the restrictions on impermissible dilution of prohibited characteristicwastes), any residue (provided that it no longer exhibits the characteristicor a new characteristic) is no longer considered to be a RCRA hazardouswaste. This does not necessarily mean, however, that treatment is curbedby the characteristic level. See section III.C. of today's preamble. The Agency is also investigating ``de minimis'' levels for certain hazardousconstituents in listed wastes below which the waste will no longer be ahazardous waste for purposes of subtitle C regulation. The Agency has yetto propose these ``de minimis'' levels; thus it has not completed its evaluationof the regulations that would be affected, in particular, the relationshipof ``de minimis'' levels to treatment standards promulgated under the landdisposal restrictions. <T3>(2) Mixtures of Different Hazardous Waste Streams.</T3> Today's proposedtreatment standards apply to mixtures of different waste streams. Wherea waste mixture has more than one applicable concentration-based treatmentstandard for a particular constituent, the most stringent standard mustbe met prior to land disposal (see 40 CFR 268.41(b)). In the event thata waste mixture cannot be treated to meet the most stringent standard,one may petition the Agency for a variance from the treatment standardpursuant to 40 CFR 268.44. <T3>c. Wastewater Versus Nonwastewater Standards.</T3> In today's proposedrule the treatment standards (both concentration-based and specified methods)are generally presented as applicable to wastewaters or to nonwastewaters.However, for certain wastes or waste treatability subcategories the Agencyis not making a distinction between wastewater and nonwastewaters. As an example, for some treatability subcategories of D001, D002, and D003wastes, the definition of these wastes in 40 CFR 261.21, 261.22, and 261.23establishes only a single treatability group (e.g., the characteristicof corrosivity only applies to ``aqueous'' wastes (i.e., water) and to``liquids'' according to andSection;andSection; 261.22(a) (1) and (2) respectively.In other cases, making such a distinction would be nonsensical (e.g., D001ignitable compressed gases). Thus, the Agency is generally proposing toapply only one standard to these treatability subcategories for which thedistinction between wastewater and nonwastewater cannot be made. (See discussionof proposed standards for each D001, D002, and D003 treatability subcategoryin section III.A.4. of today's preamble.) The Agency believes that thisis the most reasonable approach for these characteristic wastes becausethe difference between wastewater and nonwastewater may be difficult (orimpossible) to establish, or is unnecessary to make because the same technologycan be logically applied to the entire treatability subgroup. <T3>(1) Definition of Wastewaters and Nonwastewaters.</T3> Generally, theAgency is adopting in this notice the definition of wastewaters that wasused to promulgate treatment standards for the First and Second Third finalrules. Wastewaters are defined as those wastes (listed wastes, includingwastes generated as a result of the ``mixture'' and ``derived-from'' rules)that contain less than 1% total organic carbon (TOC) <T3>and</T3> less than 1% total suspended solids, except for those wastesidentified as F001, F002, F003, F004, and F005 solvent-water mixtures.(See 53 FR 31145 (August 17, 1988) which adopts this definition for mostFirst Third wastes, and 51 FR 40579 (November 7, 1986) for the definitionof F001, F002, F003, F004, and F005 solvent-water mixtures.) Those wastes(listed wastes, including wastes that are hazardous as a result of the``mixture'' and ``derived-from'' rules) that do not meet these criteriaare defined as nonwastewaters and thus would contain greater than or equalto 1% TOC, <T3>or</T3> greater than or equal to 1% total suspended solids. (Note,however, the discussion in III.B. of further subcategorization of nonwastewatersfor purposes of national capacity variances based on a lack of solids incinerationcapacity.) <T3>(2) Impermissible Switching of Applicable Wastewater and NonwastewaterStandards.</T3> It is not permissible to dilute or partially treat a wastein order to switch the applicability of a nonwastewater standard to a wastewaterstandard, or vice versa (see 52 FR 21012 (June 4, 1987); but see 52 FR25767 (July 8, 1987) noting special circumstances when California listwastes are involved). The Agency has established this principle becausetechnologies applicable to nonwastewaters are not generally applicableto wastewaters, or require special designs (in the cases of incineration)in order to simultaneously handle wastewaters. Furthermore, treatment residuesmeeting the definition of nonwastewaters must comply with all applicablenonwastewater treatment standards; likewise, residual wastewaters mustcomply with all applicable wastewater treatment standards. The Agency recognizes, however, that certain technologies are specificallydesigned to separate wastewaters from nonwastewaters. Such technologiesmay or may not be considered partial treatment under this principle, asdiscussed in the following paragraphs. Dewatering technologies such as filtration and centrifugation are typicallydesigned to remove suspended solid materials (TSS) from aqueous wastes.(Note: For the purposes of applying BDAT treatment standards, the Agencydoes not consider carbon adsorption a dewatering technology even thoughit may act as a filter for suspended material.) When these technologiesare applied to a nonwastewater that contains greater than 1% TSS but lessthan 1% TOC, the resultant liquid residue will probably meet the definitionof a wastewater (i.e., it will probably contain less than 1% TSS and lessthan 1% TOC). The Agency does not consider this impermissible switchingof applicable treatment standards. When the suspended material is organic and the overall untreated wastecontains greater than 1% TOC, these dewatering technologies are also notprecluded from use. The resultant residuals (i.e., the removed solids andthe liquids) must comply with the applicable wastewater or nonwastewatertreatment standards depending on their TOC and TSS content. If the liquidresidues from these dewatering technologies meet the definition of wastewaters,the Agency does not consider this impermissible switching of applicablestandards. The importance of the TOC level in determining impermissible switchingof applicable wastewater or nonwastewater treatment standard is apparentin the scenario of treatment of a waste containing less than 1% TSS andslightly more than 1% TOC (such as 2 or 3% TOC), and thereby being a nonwastewaterby definition. If EPA has established concentration-based treatment standardsfor the corresponding wastewater form of this waste, it would be permissibleto use carbon adsorption to treat this nonwastewater, so long as theseconcentration-based treatment standards for the wastewaters are ultimatelyachieved (i.e., if the residual wastewater contains hazardous constituentsat levels above the concentration-based wastewater treatment standards,additional treatment with other technologies is necessary prior to landdisposal.) However, if EPA has established a wastewater treatment standardexpressed as ``Carbon Adsorption as a Method of Treatment'' for this wastecode, the nonwastewater described above must comply with the standard forthe nonwastewater form, despite the fact that the TOC content is only slightlygreater than 1%. This is not just a mechanical application of the requirementthat treatment must be conducted by the specified method, with the treatabilitygroup determined at the point of generation. EPA established ``Carbon Adsorptionas a Method of Treatment'' standard for certain wastewaters based on theassumption that wastewaters typically contain TOC levels much less than1%, so that removal of the organic constituents from these wastewaterswas anticipated to be effective. If the nonwastewater previously describedis subjected to carbon adsorption as a method of treatment, there wouldbe no means of assuring optimum removal of the hazardous constituents.Thus, in such a situation, the use of carbon adsorption for this nonwastewater,is not permitted as a means of complying with BDAT. The Agency considersthis an impermissible switching of applicable treatability groups and treatmentstandards. <T3>(3) Application of Wastewater/Nonwastewater Standards To Residues GeneratedFrom Use of a Specified Method.</T3> When EPA specifies a treatment methodas the treatment standard, residues resulting from the required treatmentmethod are no longer prohibited from land disposal unless EPA should otherwisespecify. Commenters during previous rulemakings suggested that EPA specificallyclarify the applicability of the treatment standards expressed as a requiredmethod for certain residues generated from the use of the specified methods.In the Second Third final rule (see generally 54 FR 26625, 26630, June23, 1989), the Agency presented specific guidelines on this. This summaryis repeated here for the reader's convenience. Where EPA has established``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' as a treatment standard for nonwastewatersand/or wastewaters, or where EPA has established ``Carbon Adsorption asa Method of Treatment'' for wastewaters, the following statements concerningresiduals from treatment trains incorporating these technologies are true:(1) Scrubber waters from incinerators in compliance with the substantiveprovisions of 40 CFR 264 subpart O or 265 subpart O are considered to meetthe treatment standard and can be land disposed; (2) the scrubber watersfrom incinerators in compliance with the substantive provisions of 40 CFR264 subpart O or part 265 subpart O are not required to undergo ``CarbonAdsorption as a Method of Treatment'' when this specified wastewater treatmentmethod also has been established; (3) incinerator ashes and residues fromthe subsequent treatment of scrubber waters from incinerators in compliancewith the substantive provisions of 40 CFR 264 subpart O or 265 subpartO are considered to meet the required ``Incineration'' treatment standard,and can be land disposed; (4) incinerator equipment (such as fire brick)derived from sections of the incinerator that have been directly subjectedto the high temperatures of the incinerator that was operated in compliancewith the substantive provisions of 40 CFR 264 subpart O or 265 subpartO, or are downstream from the high temperature zones, are considered tomeet the treatment standards for these wastes and can be land disposed;(5) wastewater effluent and any subsequent nonwastewater treatment residuesfrom carbon adsorption units treating wastewater forms of these wastes(i.e., wastes from downstream from the carbon column) are considered tomeet the specified treatment standard and can be land disposed; and (6)where EPA specifies carbon adsorption as the treatment method for wastewaters,spent carbon, as well as any other nonwastewater residues from the wastewatertreatment preceding carbon adsorption, are <T3>not</T3> considered to meet the treatment standard; such spent carbonand nonwastewater residues must be treated by the specified nonwastewatermethod prior to land disposal. <T3>d. Transfer of Treatment Standards.</T3> Rather than testing the performanceof BDAT on every waste, for certain wastes the Agency examines similaritiesin waste stream characteristics and constituents in order to transfer treatmentstandards from a tested waste to a similar untested waste. EPA believesthat transferring treatment performance data for untested wastes is technicallyvalid, particularly when the untested wastes are generated from similarindustries or similar processing steps. EPA also believes that transferringtreatment performance data for tested constituents in one waste to untestedconstituents in another similar waste is technically valid, particularlywhen the constituents and wastes have similar chemical and physical properties.To determine whether wastes generated by different processes can be treatedto the same performance levels, EPA reviews data on waste characteristicsto identify parameters that are expected to affect treatment selection.When this analysis suggests that an untested waste can be treated withthe same technology as a tested waste, the Agency examines a more comprehensivelist of constituents that represent the most important waste characteristicsthat will affect treatment performance.The complete methodology for transferring treatment standards, however,depends upon the waste itself and often differs from treatability groupto treatability group. For a detailed discussion of the transfer methodologyfor the wastes presented in today's notice, refer to the background documentsfor each waste or treatability group and the background documents for thewastes from which the treatment standards were transferred.EPA notes further that in the case of transfers of standards based on performanceof incineration, EPA is most often transferring standards that were basedon the ability of the incinerator to achieve destruction of organics todetection limits as measured in the ash and scrubber water. This is supportedby data from approximately fourteen different test burns of a variety ofdifferent RCRA hazardous wastes. These wastes contained varying concentrationsof many BDAT list organics. While not all of the organics on the BDAT listwere present in the untreated wastes, the residues were analyzed for themand thus detection limits were calculated for a variety of incineratorresidues. In developing concentration-based treatment standards for U andP wastes, the Agency considered all of these detection limits and determinedwhich were the most representative of U and P wastes. In order to accountfor the anticipated variability in waste characteristics of untreated Uand P wastes, the Agency typically selected the highest detection limitsfor the constituent that corresponded to the chemical represented by theU or P code. Thus, the Agency believes the resultant treatment standardsshould be achievable on a routine basis for the majority of U and P wastes.However, in developing concentration-based treatment standards for specificF and K wastes containing organics, the Agency considered all of thesedata and determined which particular waste was the most representativeof that particular F or K waste (based on the availability of waste characterizationdata for the untreated F or K waste). As a result, the Agency often transferredtreatment standards that were significantly lower than those developedfor the U and P wastes. The Agency believes that these lower treatmentstandards are achievable for these F and K wastes based on the achievabilityof detection limits in the waste matrix from which the standard was transferred.<T3>e. Analytical Requirements and Relationship of PQLs to BDAT_</T3>(1)<T3>Waste Analysis Requirements. </T3>In today's proposed rule, BDAT hasbeen identified as a destruction technology for organic constituents andcyanides in many wastes. For these wastes the best measure of treatmentperformance is one that reflects the extent to which these organics andcyanides have been destroyed. This approach is likewise consistent withthe Congressional preference to destroy hazardous wastes where possible.See, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec. S 9179 (July 25, 1984) (statement of Sen. Chaffee)(wastes with high organic content should be incinerated). This approachis also consistent with the strong Congressional goal of eliminating uncertaintyfrom land disposal of hazardous waste, see, e.g., RCRA section 3004(d)(1),because it ensures removal of hazardous constituents from the land disposalenvironment. Therefore, the corresponding treatment standards for theseconstituents are based on an analysis of total constituent concentrationsin a representative sample of the treated waste. [NOTE: The land disposalrestrictions for solvent waste codes F001-F005 (51 FR 40572) require analysisof waste extracts obtained from the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure(TCLP) as a measure of performance. At the time that the treatment standardsfor F001-F005 were promulgated, useful data were not available on totalconstituent concentrations in treated residuals and, as a result, the TCLPwas considered to be the best available measure of performance.]In cases where treatment standards for metals in nonwastewaters are basedon stabilization, the use of the TCLP is typically required as the measureof the performance of the treatment technology. Where treatment standardsfor nonwastewaters are based on multiple treatment processes due to mixturesof organics and metals, or where recovery of metals is the basis of thetreatment standards, analysis of total constituent concentrations and analysisof the TCLP extract (or EP extract depending upon the standard) must beperformed prior to land disposal.<T3>(2) The BDAT List. </T3>The Agency has established a list of chemicals,primarily derived from the constituents in 40 CFR 261 Appendix VII andAppendix VIII, that are evaluated for regulation as BDAT constituents (i.e.,concentration-based treatment standards) when they are present in a listedwaste. The rationale for selection of the particular constituents to beregulated can be found in the background document for each waste or wastetreatability group. The Agency believes that it is not limited to regulatingonly those constituents for which a waste is listed (40 CFR 261 AppendixVII). Appendix VII sets forth only the constituents that were the basisfor the listing and is not an exhaustive list of hazardous constituentsin each waste. Additional support for taking this approach is found inRCRA section 3001(f), which specifies that EPA must consider additionalhazardous constituents other than those for which the waste was listedwhen evaluating delisting petitions. Section 3001(f) thus acknowledgesthat Appendix VII is only a partial list of the hazardous constituentsthat can be present in a listed waste.<T3>(3) Relationship of Treatment Standards to PQLs. </T3>The regulatedcommunity has asked a number of questions about the relationship of treatmentstandards to the practical quantitation limits (PQLs) for a number of constituents.It is important, therefore, to clarify the definition of PQLs, their intendeduse, and their relationship to treatment standards.In proposed revisions to the September 1986 edition of Test Methods forEvaluating Solid Wastes (also known as and herein referred to as SW-846),the Agency defines PQLs as `` * * * the lowest level of quantitation thatthe Agency believes a competent laboratory can be expected to reliablyachieve.'' The intended use of PQLs is mentioned in Method 8250 of SW-846(the analytical method for the determination of semivolatile organics inwastes by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry). This discussion states:``Sample PQLs are highly matrix-dependent. The PQLs listed herein are providedfor guidance and may not always be achievable'' (SW-846, September, 1986,Table 2, p. 8250-5). The discussion further defines PQLs as the methoddetection limit in reagent water (from Table 1, pp. 8250-2, 8250-3, and8250-4) multiplied by a matrix dependent factor that was estimated forfour matrices (Table 2, p. 8250-5). As is evident from the above citations, the PQLs are directly related tothe amount of interferences that are present in the different waste matrices,and the PQLs listed in SW-846 are not always achievable for constituentsas measured in untreated wastes. However, the Agency points out that mosttreatment processes, particularly destructive technologies such as incineration,destroy not only the hazardous constituents of the waste but also otherorganics that typically interfere with the analysis for constituents inuntreated wastes as well. Thus, PQLs typically are significantly lowerfor treatment residuals such as incinerator ash than for untreated wastes.Such differences in PQLs for untreated versus treated wastes are demonstratedby the data for almost every incineration test burn performed by the Agencyin developing BDAT treatment standards (see appropriate background documentsfor each waste treatability group).Potential users of PQLs should keep in mind that the PQLs in SW-846 wereestablished to provide guidance for the analysis of waste samples by actingas minimum performance criteria for analytical laboratories. The PQLs donot necessarily represent the lowest limits of analytical performance achievablefor any given waste.The PQLs in SW-846 were intended to be broadly applied to groups of wastes.As a result, matrix dependent correction factors were not developed forany particular waste code, and do not specifically apply to any particulartreatment residuals (i.e., only correction factors for matrices identifiedas ground water, low-level soil, high-level soil, and non-water misciblewaste were specified in Method 8250 of SW-846). Furthermore, the Agencyis currently modifying and expanding the matrix correction factors, aswell as modifying the detection limits from which the PQLs are derived.The PQLs listed in SW-846 for some constituents are less stringent thansome of the treatment standards. This apparent anomaly results primarilyfrom the fact that the PQLs in SW-846 were not based on the same wastematrices (i.e., treatment residues) that were tested in developing thetreatment standards. The treatment standards for a given waste code arebased on analysis of the treatment residuals of the waste (or in some cases,a similar waste from which the treatment standards are transferred). Consequently,the resulting treatment standards appropriately reflect the level of analyticalperformance achievable for that waste. Thus, the PQLs in SW-846 are generallynot used directly in developing the part 268 treatment standards. The question has been raised whether constraints posed by the limits ofapplicable analytical methods allow treatment standards to be met reliablyon a routine basis. The Agency points out that the laboratories used todevelop the treatment standards are reliable and must maintain compliancewith EPA's Quality Assurance/Quality Control requirements on a routinebasis. The background documents for all wastes for which incineration hasbeen established as BDAT provide additional support that treatment standardsare above the limits of detection for regulated constituents on a routinebasis. These documents provide data that indicate that the laboratoriesconsistently obtain low detection limits for the regulated constituentsin the wastes.In cases where a facility believes that waste-specific treatment standardscannot be met because their laboratory is unable to achieve PQLs belowthe treatment standards on specific treatment residuals, the facility maysubmit a petition for a variance from the treatment standards for thatparticular waste code (EPA construes 40 CFR 268.44 as encompassing suchpetitions). The facility must demonstrate that the analyses are in compliancewith all other BDAT QA/QC provisions (as outlined in the BDAT Generic QualityAssurance Project Plan (EPA/530-SW-87-011, March 1987). Moreover, the petitionermust also demonstrate that the treatment process is a well-designed andwell-operated BDAT process.(Note: The Agency may use analytical methods that are not specificallyidentified in SW-846 for setting treatment standards, provided that themethods comply with all appropriate detection limits, spike/surrogate recoveries,and other quality assurance criteria. Thus, a facility may also developa petition in a similar manner.)<T3>f. Treatment Standards Based on Single Facility Data, Grab SamplesVersus Composite Samples, and Waste Analysis Plans_(1) Single FacilityData.</T3> As discussed in the August 17, 1988 final rule for First Thirdwastes, the Agency believes that the use of a small number of data setsfrom a single treatment facility can be representative of the treatmentachieved by the particular treatment system. This is particularly truewhen no other treatment data are available, or when data exist but thereis no verification that the treatment process from which the data wereobtained was well-designed or well-operated. It is not possible for theAgency to sample every facility generating the waste or every treatmentsystem treating the waste. For the purposes of determining treatment standards,the Agency has established a methodology for selecting particular facilitiesand treatment systems that it considers to be well-designed and well-operated.The Agency also selects wastes that are representative of those most difficultto treat.The Agency recognizes that there is variability inherent in every treatmentsystem, as well as variability in the characteristics of the wastes. TheAgency accounts for these by multiplying the mean of the constituent concentrationsby a correction factor known as the variability factor. This factor isderived through a quantitative procedure that determines the statistical99th percentile for the treatment standard. This establishes a treatmentstandard that should be achievable 99 percent of the time by a well-designed,well-operated system. The Agency further adjusts the treatment standardto account for variabilities due to analytical recovery. In addition, allanalyses of hazardous constituents are performed in accordance with anestablished QA/QC plan as outlined in the BDAT Generic Quality AssuranceProject Plan. The Agency is confident that this methodology will resultin treatment standards that accurately represent the performance of a particulartreatment system.Standards based on incineration are always established above the limitof detection rather than at the detection limit. This is because the Agencyprefers to account for the variability inherent in the treatment systemand in the analysis of the recovery data. Therefore, following EPA's methodologyfor establishing treatment standards, the data (the average detection limit)are adjusted through use of the variability factor (typically 2.8) anda correction for recovery of a spiked analyte (or surrogate). The resultingtreatment standards for the organic constituents are above the detectionlimits. The standards are thus actually greater than the achievable levels(which are at or below the detection limits) and should be easily met bya well-designed, well-operated incineration system.<T3>(2) Grab versus Composite Samples.</T3> Where performance data existbased on both the analysis of composite samples and the analysis of grabsamples, the Agency establishes the treatment standards based on the analysisof grab samples. Grab samples normally reflect maximum process variability,and thus would reasonably characterize the ranges of treatment system performance.In cases where only composite data exist, the Agency considers the QA/QCof the data, the inherent efficiency of the process design, and the levelof performance achieved. The Agency may then choose to use this compositedata to develop the treatment standard. Where these data are used to establishthe treatment standard, the treatment standard is identified as based onanalysis of a composite sample. Enforcement of that standard thus wouldalso be based on composite samples.<T3>(3) Waste Analysis Plans.</T3> The waste analysis plan shall providethe basis for monitoring a disposal facility's compliance with promulgatedtreatment standards. This plan must be adequate to assure compliance withpart 268. The disposal facility is, however, ultimately responsible ifit disposes a waste that does not meet a treatment standard. Therefore,a disposal facility may violate the land disposal restrictions while atthe same time complying with the provisions of its waste analysis plan.Put another way, a waste analysis plan may be written to authorize typesof sampling and monitoring different from those used to develop the treatmentstandard(s). In such an instance, the disposal facility must demonstratethat the waste analysis plan (and the specific deviating feature) is adequateto assure compliance with part 268 (see 40 CFR 264.13). This might require,for example, a demonstration of statistical equivalence between a compositesampling protocol and one based on grab sampling, or a demonstration ofwhy monitoring for a subset of pollutants would assure compliance of thosenot monitored.In any case, enforcement of the land disposal restrictions is based ongrab samples (except as described in the previous section) and analysisof all constituents regulated by the applicable treatment standards, noton the facility's waste analysis plan.<T3>g. General Issues on Developing Treatment Standards for CharacteristicWastes.</T3> This section of today's preamble presents a discussion ofgeneral issues on establishing treatment standards for all characteristicwastes. EPA initially took the position that wastes that are hazardousexclusively by virtue of exhibiting a characteristic are not subject tothe RCRA section 3004(g)(C) ``hard hammer'' (See 51 FR 1607 n.4., January14, 1986). EPA no longer takes this position, and is now reading RCRA section3004(g)(6)(C) to encompass all wastes for which EPA has an obligation toestablish treatment standards for under paragraph (g)(5), which includesidentified characteristic wastes. The legislative history also indicatesthat Congress intended EPA to include identified characteristic wastes(i.e., those identified as of the effective date of HSWA) by the statutorydeadline (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1133, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 88 (1984)). Inany case, since EPA intends to promulgate treatment standards for thesewastes, the issue has no practical significance.The criteria for identifying a waste as a characteristic hazardous wasteare defined in 40 CFR 261.21 through 261.24. These criteria identify fivemajor groups of characteristic wastes: Ignitable (D001), Corrosive (D002),Reactive (D003), EP Toxic Metals (D004-D011), and EP Toxic Pesticides (D012-D017).There are several criteria within each of these major groups that definethe particular characteristic. EPA used these individual criteria as thebasis for identifying treatability groups (subcategories) within each majorcharacteristic group.There are a number of options for developing treatment standards for anycharacteristic waste code or subcategory. One option is to propose concentration-basedstandards when the Agency has data to support such an action. A secondoption is to propose a treatment standard expressed as a required method.A third option is to simply establish the characteristic level as the treatmentstandard. A fourth option is to establish a method of treatment along witha required performance level. (See preamble section III.C. for furtherdiscussion of EPA's authority to establish treatment standards for characteristicwastes.)Section III.A.4. of today's preamble presents the proposed treatment standardsfor: ignitable (D001), corrosive (D002), and reactive (D003) characteristicwastes; their treatability subcategories; and related U and P reactivewastes. Proposed treatment standards for EP Toxic Metals (D004-D011) arepresented in section III.A.5. along with proposed treatment standards forsome K, U and P wastes that contain these metals. Proposed treatment standardsfor EP Toxic Pesticides (D012-D017) are presented in section III.A.2.c.along with treatment standards for related K, U, and P halogenated pesticides.For many of the wastes that are hazardous only because they exhibit oneof the characteristics in 40 CFR 261.3(c)(1) and (d)(1), the use of someBDAT technologies will result in a residue that no longer exhibits anyof the characteristics. In some cases, however, the use of a BDAT treatmenttechnology to remove one characteristic will result in a residue whichhas a different characteristic, and thus requires further treatment (e.g.,incineration of an ignitable D001 waste may generate an ash that exhibitsthe characteristic of EP Toxicity for metals (D004-D011)). Furthermore,if the characteristic waste or its treatment residue is mixed with a listedhazardous waste, the entire mixture is considered to be the listed hazardouswaste due to the derived-from rule, even if treated to remove all characteristics.The Agency is today proposing that characteristic wastes and residues fromtreatment of characteristic wastes must be treated to meet all characteristictreatment standards prior to land disposal. When the treatment standardfor one characteristic is expressed as a required method of treatment,the method must be used <T3>and </T3>the treatment standard for any additional characteristic inthe residue must be met. See preamble section III.A.4.a. for a furtherdiscussion of this concept as it applies to ignitable, reactive, and corrosivecharacteristic wastes. For purposes of complying with today's proposed treatment standards, dilutionof characteristic wastes in order to remove the characteristic (in lieuof meeting the treatment standard) is not allowed. Dilution does not destroythe chemical constituents causing the characteristic; it is merely a physicalprocess that provides temporary removal of the characteristic which canbe reversed if the physical conditions are changed. The Agency understands,however, that dilution is sometimes necessary in order to facilitate treatment(e.g., in order to lower the BTU value of a D001 waste with a very highBTU value). This type of dilution to effect treatment is not prohibitedas long as it is not used as treatment or to avoid compliance with treatmentstandards, or in the case of California list wastes, prohibition levels.(See preamble sections III.C. and III.D. for further discussion of issuesrelating to dilution.) <T3>h. General Issues Pertaining to All Remaining U and P Wastes. </T3>Today'sproposed rule addresses several issues pertinent to the development ofconcentration-based treatment standards for U and P wastes as defined in40 CFR 261.33 (e) and (f). These include issues such as deficiencies inwaste characterization, analytical complications, sporadic generation patterns,infrequent land disposal, potential necessity for dissolution prior totreatment, and difficulties in evaluation of recycling potential. EPA isalso proposing two clarifying corrections to the existing scope of section261.33: one change to correct an unintended gap in paragraph (c), and theother to clarify that contaminated soils and other spill residues are notautomatically excluded from being solid wastes if recycled. The Agency believes that concentration-based treatment standards can bedeveloped for many of the U and P wastes based on existing data. EPA hasgrouped all of the U and P wastes into various treatability groups basedon similarities in elemental composition (e.g., carbon, halogens and metals)and the presence of key functional groups (e.g., phenolics, esters, andamines) within the structure of the individual chemical represented bythe U or P waste code. The Agency has also accounted for physical and chemicalfactors that are known to affect the selection of treatment alternativesand to affect the performance of the treatment, such as volatility andsolubility, when developing these treatability groups. The use of the chemical(e.g., pesticides and pharmaceuticals) was also important in establishingthese groups. Emphasizing the use of these chemicals allows the Agencyto identify issues specific on these groups of chemicals, to target potentialsources of data, and to solicit comments and data from specific industriesand public interest groups. <T3>(1) Waste Characterization of U and P Wastes. </T3>EPA has designateda specific U or P waste code number referring to the specific chemicalconstituent associated with that code. EPA's listing sorts these wastesinto two general hazard categories. Those wastes identified as P wastesare defined as ``acute hazardous'' wastes and those wastes identified asU wastes are defined as ``toxic'' wastes. The Agency has determined thatthese distinctions generally have no significant bearing on treatabilityof the particular chemical or waste, and thus did not consider these distinctionsbetween U and P wastes in developing the treatability groups identifiedin this section. The U and P wastes are defined as out-of-date commercial products, chemicalintermediates, off-specification (off-spec) products, container liners(or residues), or spill residues. (See 40 CFR 261.33.) These wastes canalso exist as wastewater or nonwastewater treatment residues based on thederived-from or mixture rules. In addition, U and P wastes are often containedin lab packs as complex mixtures of discarded concentrated chemicals, contaminatedlaboratory samples, old analytical laboratory standards, and contaminatedequipment. The composition of these wastes can vary significantly. Some U and P wastesmay not contain the same constituents or concentration of the specificU or P chemical that was present in the waste from which concentration-basedstandards may be proposed to be transferred. However, given the statutorytime constraints that exist, the Agency cannot possibly test every singleU and P chemical. The Agency believes that the transfer of data and developmentof concentration-based standards is the best alternative for these U andP wastes, and is therefore proposing such standards whenever possible.<T3>(2) Analytical Complications. </T3>The Agency has determined that formany U and P wastes, as well as for some K wastes, there are several complicationsthat arise in terms of how reliably the primary hazardous constituentscan be quantified. These complications appear to preclude the establishmentof concentration-based treatment standards. As a direct result of thesecomplications, the Agency is compelled to establish a method (or methods)of treatment as a treatment standard rather than concentration-based constituentspecific standards. For any particular U or P chemical, there are four major reasons that thesequantification complications exist: (1) there are no methods that are currentlyverified for the quantification of the constituent of interest in treatmentresiduals; (2) calibration standards (i.e., standard solutions of knownpurity for validating compliance with QA/QC procedures) of that chemicalare not currently available on the commercial market; (3) the chemicalmay be unstable in water, or react with water; and (4) the chemical maynot be listed as a single chemical entity (e.g., P030 is listed as ``solublecyanide salts, not otherwise specified''). Chemical specific complicationsare presented in the appropriate section of today's preamble that discussesthe specific treatability group where the U or P chemical has been classified.Implications of these complications on the general procedures for establishmentof concentration-based standards are outlined in greater detail below.<T3>(a) Availability of a Verified Analytical Method. </T3>The September,1986, edition of Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Wastes (also known asSW-846), does not include analytical methods that are currently verifiedfor the quantification of some U and P chemicals in treatment residuals.This does not imply that an existing analytical method cannot be used toquantify that particular chemical, but rather, it indicates that the Agencyhas not verified the quantification of that U or P chemical in the specifictreatment residuals of interest. However, in the absence of this verificationand where the Agency has sufficient belief that a particular analyticalmethod can analyze a particular chemical, the Agency is not precluded fromestablishing a concentration-based treatment standard for that U or P chemical.In fact, the Agency anticipates that for many U and P chemicals, analyticalmethods will be verified as appropriate for complex matrices such as treatmentresiduals. EPA is currently working to validate analytical methods fora growing number of chemicals in a variety of matrices. It is anticipatedthat treatment data obtained during the development of BDAT for specificwaste codes will also assist in the validation of these methods. For many U and P chemicals, the Agency has determined that only High PerformanceLiquid Chromatography (HPLC) analytical methods can be used to measuretheir concentration. Although HPLC techniques have been used to quantifycertain chemicals in relatively clean aqueous matrices, the Agency hasnot completely verified that HPLC is appropriate for analysis of eitheruntreated wastes or treatment residuals. There is only one HPLC methodthat is currently listed in SW-846 as applicable to analysis of solid wastes,with very limited applicability. However, the Agency is in the processof validating other HPLC methods, including multiple-column HPLC systemsand HPLC units coupled with mass spectroscopy. Until this method validationwork is completed, the Agency does not believe that it should establishconcentration-based treatment standards for these particular U and P chemicals.Further, the Agency currently lacks data on treatment of hazardous wastesbased on HPLC analyses. The Agency also recognizes the existence of methods other than those specificallyidentified in SW-846, that can successfully quantify some U and P compoundsin complex matrices, and for the purposes of today's proposed rule solicitsinformation about them. In particular, the commenter should supply allavailable QA/QC information and the data must represent analysis of treatedresiduals from the use of technologies that are equivalent to that examinedor specified in today's preamble as BDAT for that particular chemical.Commenters should specify that the submitted data are applicable to a particularwaste code. <T3>(b) Commercial Availability of Calibration Standards. </T3>Solutionsof known purity and concentration of a chemical or mix of chemicals areoften referred to as calibration standards. These are used by analyticallaboratories to verify the accuracy and precision (QA/QC) of a particularanalysis for a particular chemical or group of chemicals. The continuedavailability of these standards from commercial chemical suppliers is importantin maintaining proper QA/QC of quantitative analysis for the chemical constituentsin treatment residuals. For the purposes of routine compliance with treatmentstandards, the Agency believes that an analytical laboratory must be ableto readily and consistently purchase these calibration standards.EPA determined which compounds are commercially available by asking fivemajor suppliers whether they had the chemicals in stock and whether theywere available for shipping to prospective buyers. Only those chemicalsthus found to be ``commercially available'' were included on the list ofthose for which EPA will set concentration-based standards and requireanalytical quantification. However, EPA realizes that some analytical reagentsmay exist for these chemicals, outside the commercial inventories of themajor supply houses contacted. Nevertheless, unless a compound is consistentlyin stock at major suppliers, the Agency believes that the difficultiesin obtaining these standards and in verification of their purity are sufficientcause to not establish concentration-based treatment standards for theseU and P chemicals. This does not, however, preclude the Agency from promulgatinga concentration-based standard at a later date.While the use of calibration standards is an integral component of allanalyses, the Agency's SW-846 methods do not typically require that a calibrationstandard be available for every compound being analyzed. Surrogate compoundsare often used as calibration standards in many analytical methods. TheAgency could establish concentration-based treatment standards for a surrogatecompound in the waste or for some other waste characteristic that couldact as an indicator of effective treatment (i.e., an indicator parameter),provided that a correlation of the concentration of the surrogate or indicatorparameter to the concentration of the constituent of interest can be established.In general, the lack of waste characterization data and the variabilityin waste composition for U and P wastes interferes with the establishmentof surrogate or indicator parameters for many U and P wastes. This does not preclude the Agency from the use of surrogates or indicatorparameters in establishing concentration-based treatment standards. Wheredeemed appropriate, the Agency has specifically identified these surrogatesor indicators on a waste code specific basis in today's proposed rule.In fact, in the Land Disposal Restrictions for Second Third Wastes (54FR 26614, June 23, 1989), treatment standards for total and amenable cyanideshave already been promulgated for several U and P waste codes that arelisted as specific cyanide salts. In general, commenters to the proposedrule for these wastes supported the use of these indicator parameters.In cases where these U and P chemicals are no longer produced or used inthis country, and are not reasonably expected to be detected in environmentalor waste samples, the Agency may choose to not establish concentration-basedtreatment standards for particular constituents. In most cases, EPA doesnot wish to encourage a market for high-purity samples of these compounds,as might happen if it required that these compounds be analyzed, thus creatinga demand for quantification reagent samples. <T3>(c) Stability in Water. </T3>Some U and P compounds dissociate, decomposeor otherwise significantly change their identity when exposed to water.EPA chooses not to set concentration-based BDAT standards for these compounds,because there is generally a high probability of the presence of waterin many treatment residuals and particularly in wastes classified as wastewaters.Thus, while analytical methods may exist for some of these ``unstable''chemicals when measured in nonaqueous matrices and even in aqueous samples(depending on their ``half-life'' of instability), accurate quantificationof their concentration in treatment residuals where there is a reasonableexpectation that water may be present would be severely hampered. For manyof these chemicals, a high level of coordination of sampling and analyticalpersonnel would be required in order to assure a consistency in holdingtimes and thus highly variable analytical results might be expected. In developing the list of chemicals to be analyzed for purposes of compliancewith groundwater monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 264 (i.e., the chemicalslisted in Appendix IX), EPA faced the same problem of identifying thosechemicals that are ``unstable'' in water and therefore not amenable tothese groundwater monitoring requirements. Consequently, EPA designatesas ``unstable'' those U and P chemicals that were particularly excludedfrom Appendix IX for this reason. EPA is confident that it is correct inrelieving the regulated community from the burden of undertaking analysisof hazardous waste treatment residuals for those U and P compounds excludedfrom Appendix IX because of their instability in water. <T3>(d) Multiple or Ambiguous Identity. </T3>For several U and P wastecodes, the specific listing for that waste code does not identify onlyone particular chemical for which the listing applies (e.g., P075 is listedas ``Nicotine and salts'' and P051 is listed as ``Endrin and metabolites'').For purposes of compliance with the treatment standards, the Agency hasdetermined which chemicals should be analyzed (if any). In cases where the U or P listing did not specify particular isomers andthere are a limited number of isomers, treatment standards are typicallyreported as applicable to all isomers, are isomer specific, or are applicableto the sum of the isomers depending upon whether the identity of isomerscan be distinguished. When the exact identity of the chemical for which the U or P waste codeis listed is ambiguous, or where the listing specifies ``and salts'' or``and metabolites'', the Agency typically chooses to set a technology ratherthan a concentration-based standard in order to preclude analysis for aparticular chemical that may not have even been present originally. TheAgency also may choose to establish an indicator compound for these wastes(or the primary listed compound) that would assure treatment of any additionalchemical that may fall into the broad listing (See earlier discussion ofP030 in this section of today's preamble). <T3>(3) Current Generation and Land Disposal Practices.</T3> Data indicatethat there are relatively few generators of many of the U and P wastes.Information from the 1986 TSDR survey also suggests that the majority ofthese U and P wastes are not typically land disposed. The Agency consideredproposing a treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''for many of these wastes. However, the sporadic nature of generation suggeststhat these wastes may be generated at any time and thus may require landdisposal of treatment residues. While establishing a treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based onNo Generation'' allows generators to petition for a variance from the treatmentstandard (40 CFR 268.44), the Agency prefers to establish concentration-basedstandards or methods of treatment whenever a transfer of standards canbe reasonably performed. However, for some U and P wastes that have a verylow probability of generation, the ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''alternative may be feasible. This alternative may be particularly attractivefor a few U and P wastes for which the Agency cannot identify sufficientdata to show that treatment technologies are demonstrated or even applicable.<T3>(4) Dissolution for Treatment. </T3>Some of the discarded or off-specU and P chemicals, when existing as concentrated chemicals or mixtures,may be dissolved in a suitable solvent or water prior to treatment. Becausethis is a form of dilution, the question arises whether it is a form ofpermissible dilution. Two such instances occur as follows: 1) concentratedorganic liquids and solids are sometimes dissolved in appropriate organicsolvents (or waste solvents) and then incinerated in a liquid injectionsystem; and 2) concentrated inorganic chemicals and metal salts are sometimesdissolved in water or acidic media, chemically oxidized (or reduced), andprecipitated as an insoluble salt. In all of these cases, this type ofmanagement is permissible because it renders the chemical suitable fortreatment by the designated BDAT technology. Where organic U and P wastes are generated in small amounts, however, incinerationin a rotary kiln may be preferred over dissolution in order to reduce therisk from mixing and handling. However in other cases, dissolving the organicU and P chemicals in solvents may actually be desirable in order to reducethe maximum emission rate of halides or oxides of phosphorus, nitrogen,or sulfur that may occur from incinerating excessive amounts of the concentratedforms of these U or P chemicals. Thus, EPA does not wish to preclude dissolutionfor purposes of effective treatment. <T3>(5) Recycling Potential. </T3>The Agency believes that it may be feasibleto legitimately recycle some organic U and P wastes. For example, a true``off-spec'' product could potentially undergo further on-site processingrather than land disposal, be sold as a low grade chemical product in themarket, or be exchanged as a raw material to other industry participatingin a hazardous waste exchange program. Indeed, these materials may notbe solid wastes if legitimately recycled (see 40 CFR 261.33). However, other forms of organic U and P wastes may require further treatmentprior to recycling (e.g., organics that tend to polymerize or solidifymay need to be stabilized prior to reuse). In addition, other organic Uand P wastes may not be amenable to recycling for a variety of reasons.The major reason being that quite often other chemicals such as residualcatalysts, unreacted reagent chemicals, by-products, or process contaminantsare present in the waste that preclude their reuse. Because of the varietyin possible contaminants per organic U and P waste, the Agency cannot identifyspecific waste characteristics per waste code that would allow the Agencyto establish direct reuse as a treatment standard for the majority of Uand P organic chemicals. The Agency solicits data and information to identifythose wastes (or subcategories based on certain waste characteristics),that are amenable to direct reuse and recycling. EPA does not intend to preclude the legitimate recycling of any of thesewastes. EPA notes, however, that soil and other residues from spillingthese commercial chemicals would ordinarily not be recyclable. Indeed,the spilling onto the land is itself a type of disposal. Thus, EPA is proposingas part of today's rule a clarifying change whereby such soils and otherspill residues would be solid wastes unless they are recycled a short timeafter the spill event (see section II.P. above and III.F. below). <T3>(6) Analysis of Existing and Newly Developed Treatment Data. </T3>Overall,there are over 300 organic chemicals represented by the U and P waste codes.Existing treatment data for wastewater and nonwastewater forms of specificU and P wastes are somewhat limited. The treatability data that does existis primarily for the corresponding U or P constituents as they are presentin other wastes (such as the K wastes tested by the Agency). Therefore,in the development of today's proposed treatment standards, EPA examinedall of the available BDAT data for the corresponding U and P constituentsin approximately fourteen different incineration test burns of RCRA hazardouswastes. In addition, the Agency examined available data on the treatmentof wastewaters. The majority of all of these data appear to be for the U and P treatabilitysubcategories identified as halogenated aliphatics, aromatics, polynucleararomatic hydrocarbons, and oxygenated hydrocarbons. This seems logicalin that for wastewaters most of the available data are for those constituentsthat are also designated as priority pollutants under regulation by theAgency's Office of Water, and that for nonwastewaters most of the availabledata are for organic chemicals that are typically used as solvents or pesticides.More information on the development of treatment standards for these wastescan be found in the background document for each treatability group inthe RCRA docket. <T3>(a) Treatment Data for U and P Nonwastewaters.</T3> For the purposeof this rulemaking, the Agency examined the relative availability, expense,and ease of generating new incineration data for nonwastewater forms ofthe organic U and P waste codes. EPA decided to select for testing a limitednumber of compounds representative of the various classifications inherentto the structure of these chemicals. These new data were used in conjunctionwith previous data to develop treatment standards that were then transferredto the remaining untested wastes. The compounds that were tested were carefullyselected as representative of the treatability of each group of waste codes,based on similarities in chemical structure (i.e., presence of key functionalgroups, elemental composition (including chlorine, sulfur, and nitrogen),number of carbon atoms, arrangement and number of aromatic and nonaromaticrings, isomer and homologue series, and degree of chlorination). These new performance data on the treatment of the representative compoundswere obtained utilizing a rotary kiln incinerator and performed by EPAin June, 1989. The feed included three specific RCRA hazardous wastes thatcontained constituents in the halogenated pesticide and chlorobenzene treatabilitygroup, in concentrations of up to 8%. The hazardous wastes from this treatabilitygroup that were burned include: Heptachlor process waste (which containedChlordane, Heptachlor, hexachlorobutadiene and hexachlorocyclopentadiene),D014 (EP Toxic for Methoxychlor), and D016 (EP Toxic for 2,4-D). In addition to the three hazardous wastes, the feed contained fifteen commercialchemical products representing other various U and P waste codes. Thesecommercial chemical products were used because the Agency was unable toobtain any wastes specifically identified as U or P wastes in the periodof time required to perform the test. The burn was designed such that the physical forms, concentrations, andsoil content of the feed would represent a range of wastes likely to exist.The treatability test consisted of two 6-hour burns consisting of 11 liquidsand 7 solids. Clean fill (i.e., dirt) was added to produce ash that isnecessary in order to analyze for treated concentrations (or detectionlimits), and to simulate a waste spilled on soil. Four sample sets of ashand scrubber water were analyzed for BDAT list constituents. (More informationon the test burn can be found in the Onsite Engineering Report of the ThirdIncineration Treatability Test, July, 1989.) The Agency is proposing to use much of these data to transfer concentration-basedstandards from these compounds to the various U, P, K, and D waste codeswhere other data are unavailable or of questionable value. These data willalso supplement existing data that have been judged to represent BDAT forother wastes. <T3>(b) Treatment Data for U and P Wastewaters.</T3> Similar to the aforementionedtest burn for nonwastewaters, the Agency is conducting wastewater treatmenttests for selected U and P chemicals using wet air oxidation, powderedactivated carbon treatment (PACT), and carbon adsorption. Since much ofthe currently available wastewater treatment data is from the treatmentof relatively low concentrations of U and P constituents in industrialwastewaters, these studies have been particularly designed to examine theapplicability of these technologies to wastewaters containing relativelyhigh concentrations of U and P constituents. The data developed in thesestudies have been placed in the administrative record for inspection andcomment. For many of the U and P waste codes in today's rule, concentration-basedstandards for the wastewater forms have been developed based on concentrationsof the constituents measured in incinerator scrubber waters. In general,when the Agency has appropriate wastewater treatment data from well-designedand well-operated wastewater treatment units, it prefers to use these datarather than use scrubber water concentrations to develop wastewater treatmentstandards. This does not, however, preclude the Agency from establishingtreatment standards for other wastes based on constituent concentrationsin incinerator scrubber waters and given the time constraints imposed bythe statutory deadline, the Agency believes that the use of scrubber waterdata for the development of wastewater standards is a viable alternativeto developing no standard. Treatment standards for these wastewaters basedon incinerator scrubber water may also be appropriate when one considersthat incineration typically provides significant destruction (even forwastewaters) and that some of these wastewaters may actually contain <T3>high concentrations </T3>(near 1% TOC) of organics. Furthermore, commentersto the Second Third proposed rule, indicated that they were indeed incineratingmany wastewaters and that they did not want to be precluded from doingso where EPA had proposed only carbon adsorption as a method of treatmentfor wastewater forms of certain U and P organo-phosphorus pesticides. The Agency has recently gathered and analyzed wastewater treatment datafrom various sources including: (1) the Office of Water's Industrial TechnologyDivision (ITD) and National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)data (specifically from the Organic Chemicals, Plastics, and SyntheticFibers (OCPSF) data base); (2) the Hazardous Waste Engineering ResearchLaboratory (HWERL) database; (3) the Office of Solid Waste's BDAT data(from previous land disposal restrictions rules); and (4) additional wastewatertreatment data were gathered from literature articles on wet air oxidationand PACT. As expected, these data include the treatment of wastewatersthat are not specifically listed as D, F, K, U, or P wastewaters, but docontain varying concentrations of many of the corresponding constituents.While these data were not available in time to incorporate into the discussionof individual treatability groups in sections III.A.2. through III.A.7.of today's notice, or into the background document for each treatabilitygroup, these data <T3>are</T3> being placed in the administrative record for today's noticeand the Agency has been able to develop alternative standards for wastewatersbased on these data. These alternative wastewater treatment standards are presented in sectionIII.A.7. of today's notice as treatment standards for wastewater formsof multi-source leachate. While these standards are presented on a constituentbasis, they correspond to the respective waste code. (For example, thealternative standard for ``U220 (toluene)'' wastewaters based on thesenew data is presented simply as a standard for ``toluene'' for wastewaterforms of multi-source leachate in section III.A.7.; the standard for U220(toluene) presented in section III.A.3.b. is the standard based on analysisof scrubber water.) Thus, the Agency is proposing these standards as alternativestandards for all U and P wastewaters for which concentration-based standardsbased on incinerator scrubber waters have been proposed in sections III.A.2.and III.A.3. of today's preamble and for some wastewater forms of EP Toxicmetals. Further information on these alternative standards based on thesedata can be found in the ``BDAT Background Document for Wastewaters ContainingBDAT List Constituents'' in the administrative record for today's notice.Much of these new data for wastewaters include analysis of composite samplesrather than grab samples. Thus, the Agency has developed many of the alternativeconcentration-based treatment standards based on an analysis of compositesamples rather than grab samples. Where data from analysis of compositesamples were used as the basis of the treatment standard, the Agency soindicates in the appropriate table of treatment standards.The Chemical Manufacturing Association (CMA) has calculated suggested wastewatertreatment standards for many constituents based on data contained in theOCPSF database, and has submitted these suggested limits to the Agencyfor review. However, standards based solely on these data may not be representativeof the treatability of all wastewaters, in particular wastewater formsof U, P, and D wastes containing high concentrations of the respectivechemicals. As an example, the standard suggested by CMA for chloroformin wastewaters is lower than that promulgated by the Agency specificallyfor K009 and K010 wastewaters. The Agency has not completed its reviewof CMA's suggested standards; however, it has placed this information inthe administrative record for today's notice. <T3>(7) Methods of Treatment as U and P Wastewater Standards. </T3>Basedon analytical complications previously discussed in section III.A.1.h.(2.),the Agency is proposing certain methods of treatment as the treatment standardfor many U and P wastewaters and nonwastewaters. Generally, for U and Pnonwastewaters this process is relatively easy because incineration processesare relatively indiscriminate in the destruction of organics due to thehigh temperatures, efficient mixing, and consistent residence times. However,in the case of wastewater treatment technologies, there are more chemicalspecific factors that are involved such as: water solubility, instability,molecular size, volatility, elemental composition, and polarity of thespecific chemical that is to be treated. Other waste characteristics willalso affect the efficiency of treatment such as: total organic carbon,oil and greases, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, pH, andalkalinity/acidity. For these reasons, the Agency has grouped the organic U and P waste codesinto treatability groups (as presented in sections III.A.2. and III.A.3.)that are designed to reflect similarities in wastewater and nonwastewatertreatment besides similarities in structure or elemental composition. However,in some cases these similarities may not reflect similarities in treatabilityfor all wastewater treatment technologies. As a result, the Agency hastypically proposed more than one method of treatment as the treatment standardfor these U and P wastewater treatability groups. In all cases, the Agency believes that incineration, while not always practicalfor wastewaters, will provide an efficient destruction of these organicU and P constituents in wastewaters. While the Agency does not want toidentify incineration as the primary BDAT treatment technology for thesewastewaters, it also does not want to preclude its use. In addition, theAgency does not want to process needless variances for a technology thatis recognized to be effective. Therefore, in all cases, ``Incinerationas a Method of Treatment'' is proposed as one of the alternative treatmentstandards for wastewater forms of these organic U and P wastes.The wastewater treatment technology that most closely resembles incinerationis wet air oxidation. It is specifically designed to destroy organics inwastewaters and efficiently oxidizes organics in aqueous media by operatingat relatively high temperatures and high pressures. Furthermore, wet airoxidation is typically performed on wastewaters that contain relativelyhigh concentrations of organics (i.e., those that are at or near the 1%TOC cut-off for wastewaters). For wastewaters that contain significantlylower concentrations of organics, chemical oxidation and biodegradationcan typically provide the necessary destruction of organics to levels thatcan then be adsorbed onto activated carbon (as a polishing step). Sincethese technologies are known to provide effective treatment for constituentsthat can be analyzed, the Agency is therefore proposing multiple treatmenttechnologies for most of the organic U and P constituents that requirespecified methods of treatment. None of these technologies have been specificallyidentified as better than the others due to the current lack of data forthese constituents that are difficult to analyze, or for any other surrogate/indicatorparameters. However, the Agency is currently investigating the potentialuse of surrogates/indicators that could be used to ensure complete destructionand to determine which technology performs best for these U and P constituentsin wastewaters. The Agency is soliciting comment on the selection of surrogates(such as COD, BOD, TOC, and etc.) that could be established per waste ortechnology, and any data that may aid in the comparison of these technologiesfor these wastes. The Agency reminds commenters that these particularlydifficult to analyze U and P wastewaters are generated at relatively fewfacilities, and that surrogates that can be used to measure performancefor these constituents may be best addressed in an individual facility'swaste analysis plan.For quite a few of the organic and some inorganic U and P wastes that requirespecified methods of treatment, concentration-based treatment standardshave not been proposed because the compounds are relatively unstable inwater. This instability implies that they should easily be destroyed withany chemical oxidant (and most probably at ambient temperature and airpressure). In a similar manner, biodegradation can be expected to resultin oxidation of certain U and P organics. Again, due to the instabilityof these organic compounds in water, the Agency believes that biodegradationcan provide effective removal of some of these organics from wastewaters.<T3>(8) Regulated Constituents. </T3>The regulated constituents for theD, U, and P wastes generally are those specific constituents for whichthe D, U, or P waste is listed (as specified in 40 CFR 261.33 (e) and (f)).The regulated constituents for the F and K wastes were determined basedon waste characterization, the constituents for which the F and K wastewas listed, and compounds shown or expected to be present in the waste.Other than the D wastes, metals are typically regulated only for selectedU, P, F, and K wastes in these treatability groups when they are expectedto be present. More detail on the selection of regulated constituents canbe found in the background documents for each treatability subcategory.The proposed regulated constituents for these wastes and the proposed treatmentstandards are presented in the tables at the end of each section.i. Procedures for Requesting Additional Data on Specific Treatment StandardsThe Agency is today proposing treatment standards according to a relativelyrapid schedule. This schedule is statutorily imposed and requires thattreatment standards must be developed for all remaining RCRA waste codesby May 8, 1990. If treatment standards are not developed by this so-called``hard hammer'' date, the wastes are automatically prohibited from landdisposal by statute.Every effort has been made to develop treatment standards for all of theseremaining waste codes in this proposed rule. In certain cases, however,EPA expects to receive additional data during the public comment periodpertaining to the proposed treatment standard. This additional data maybe used to refine the proposed treatment standard. In order to give otherinterested parties the opportunity to comment on any data submitted duringthe public comment period, EPA will make these data available upon specificrequest.In instances where EPA expects additional data to be submitted during thepublic comment period, the Agency identifies this potential in the appropriatesection of the preamble. Commenters should attempt to identify all areaswhere additional data can be submitted without the Agency specificallyrequesting it. Commenters should view this proposal as their opportunityto provide the additional data required to develop these standards. Datasubmissions should be in compliance with all appropriate BDAT data requirementsand should include all appropriate QA/QC information. The Agency also pointsout that treatment data must include analyses of treatment residuals andthat operational evidence must be provided indicating that the treatmentsystem was both well-designed and well-operated. Submission of such datadoes not guarantee that BDAT will be developed based on the submitted data.(EPA notes that commenters could have been legitimately aware of the needto generate such data since November, 1984. EPA thus will look with disfavoron comments protesting the lack of time to develop such data.)Data submitted during the comment period must be properly noticed and availableto the public. All new data must be submitted within 30 days of this noticein order for the Agency to give subsequent notice of these new data followingthe procedures outlined in this section. Data received after 30 days willbe placed in the administrative docket for the final rule, but may notbe considered in development of the final standards. Given the time constraintsfor this rule, data that are submitted as confidential business informationlimits the Agency's ability to incorporate into these treatment standards.Commenters wishing to receive a copy of any additional data, should specificallyrequest it in writing and submit it to the RCRA docket, identifying therequest according to the specific preamble section numbers and title ofinterest (i.e., ``III.A.5.g._Arsenic Stabilization Data''). This requestfor additional data may be included as part of your comments on the overallproposed rule, or it may be made separately. The request for additionaldata (as well as all comments on the overall proposed rule) must be submittedto the RCRA docket during the 45-day public comment period_the Agency prefersthat these requests be submitted early in the comment period, i.e., within30 days of the notice, in order to expedite this subsequent notice of dataas it arrives.The Agency intends to send copies of additional data only to persons specificallyrequesting it, following the aforementioned procedures. It will be extremelyburdensome for the Agency to process requests for data that are nonspecific(e.g., requests for all data submissions). The Agency also points out thatall new data will be submitted to the RCRA docket for public viewing asrapidly as possible. The Agency will allow 21 days from the date the additionaldata are mailed to those requesting it for review and submittal of anywritten response. Subsequent comments on the additional data must be sentto the RCRA docket and be clearly identified as ``Response to AdditionalData Pertaining to * * *'' [preamble sections numbers and specific treatmentstandard title].<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Proposed Treatment Standards for Halogenated Organic Wastes</ITAG><T3>a. Introduction.</T3> Many of the chemicals represented by the U andP wastes and many of the major constituents present in several D, F, andK wastes fall under a general category of chemicals known as halogenatedorganics. For the purposes of assessing BDAT, the Agency has determinedthat within this general category, there are six major subcategories ofwastes based primarily on similarities in the structure of these halogenatedorganic chemicals. These subcategories are also based partially on theindustrial use and waste generation patterns of the wastes. These majorsubcategories include: chlorinated aliphatics, halogenated pesticides,chlorobenzenes, halogenated phenolics, brominated organics, and miscellaneoushalogenated organics.<T3>(1) Relationship to the California List Rule for HOCs.</T3> The Agencypromulgated treatment standards for certain California list wastes on July8, 1987 (52 FR 25760). Treatment standards were promulgated for certainhalogenated organic compounds (HOCs) when present in hazardous wastes ata total HOC concentration of greater than 1,000 parts per million (ppm),as well as for liquid RCRA hazardous wastes containing greater than 50ppm of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Although PCBs are also halogenatedorganics, this stricter limit for PCBs was mandated by HSWA.There is a regulatory overlap between treatment standards for Californialist HOCs and treatment standards for halogenated organics proposed intoday's rule. The Agency has stated in previous rulemakings (see 52 FR25773; 53 FR 31187) that, in cases when there is a regulatory overlap,the more waste-specific treatment standard and effective date applies.This principle is set out in the rules in section 268.32(h). The concentration-basedtreatment standards being proposed today, when promulgated, will thereforesupercede the California list treatment standards because they are morespecific treatment standards. However, if there is a national capacityvariance based on the new standards, the old standards will continue toapply during the period of the variance. (See further discussion of thisfinal point in section III.M. below.)<T3>(2) Specifying Incineration for Halogenated Nonwastewaters.</T3> Asgenerated, the majority of the wastes listed in this section of the preambleare likely to contain greater than 1,000 ppm of HOCs, and thus land disposalof these wastes is most likely already restricted by the California listprohibition for HOCs. This prohibition further establishes that BDAT forthese HOCs is Incineration as a Method of Treatment, with Fuel Substitutionas a Method of Treatment (burning in a boiler or industrial furnace) allowedas an alternative. The Agency assumed that there was sufficient fuel contentin many of the wastes that would fall under the broad definition of HOCwastes.In the proposal for the Second Third wastes (54 FR 1056, (January 11, 1989)),the Agency presented advance notice that it was considering the transferof performance data to the majority of the remaining waste codes that containhalogenated organics from the incineration of various other halogenatedwastes (such as K0l9 and F024). In doing so, the Agency indicated thatincineration was the appropriate treatment technology and would probablybe determined to be BDAT for these halogenated organic wastes. (The Agencyin fact, specifically indicated each waste code that was considered a halogenatedorganic.) No comments were received indicating that any other technologyshould be considered BDAT for the majority of these halogenated organicwastes.Due to the high concentrations of specific, identified halogenated organicsknown or anticipated to be present in these U and P off-spec chemicals;the relatively high toxicity of some of the pesticides and miscellaneoushalogenated organics; the anticipated low fuel value of these U and P wastes;and the need for control of HCl emissions from the destruction of halogenatedorganics, the Agency does not believe that fuel substitution is a viablealternative for the majority of specific U and P waste codes identifiedin this section.In today's rule, the Agency is proposing that incineration represents BDATfor all of the halogenated organics presented in this section. Where theAgency is proposing ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' as the treatmentstandard for a particular halogenated organic waste code, it has not includedfuel substitution as an alternative. However, where the Agency has proposedconcentration-based standards, thermal destruction in fuel substitutionunits is not precluded.<T3>(3) Additional Wastewater Treatment Data. </T3>Additional wastewatertreatment data primarily from the Agency's Office of Water have been recentlyanalyzed for incorporation into the treatment standards for many of theU and P wastes in this section. These data include the treatment of wastewatersthat are not specifically listed as U or P wastewaters, but do containmany of the corresponding U, P, and metal constituents. While these datawere not available in time to incorporate into this discussion or intothe background document for these wastes, these data are being placed inthe administrative record for today's notice. Therefore, the Agency isnot precluded from using these data in promulgating the standards for thesewastes. Further information on these data can be found in section IlI.A.1.h.(6.).Alternative standards based on these data are presented in section III.A.7.of today's notice for wastewater forms of multisource leachate. These standardsare presented on a constituent basis and correspond to the respective Uor P wastewater. Thus, the Agency is proposing these standards as alternativestandards for all U and P wastewaters for which concentration-based standardsbased on incinerator scrubber waters have been proposed in the followingsections.<T3>(4) Specifying Technologies for Halogenated Wastewaters. </T3>Basedon analytical complications previously discussed in section III.A.1.h.(2.),the Agency is also proposing certain methods of treatment as the treatmentstandards for many U and P wastewaters. In the following sections (III.A.2.b.through f.) of the preamble the Agency identifies twenty five specifichalogenated organic U and P wastes for which the Agency is proposing threetreatment technologies as alternative BDAT treatment standards: (1) Wetair oxidation followed by carbon adsorption; (2) Chemical oxidation followedby carbon adsorption; or (3) Incineration of wastewaters. Since these technologiesare known to provide effective treatment for the halogenated organic constituentswithin each treatability group (as identified in III.A.2.) that can beanalyzed, the Agency is therefore proposing these multiple treatment technologiesfor all of the twenty five U and P halogenated organics that require specifiedmethods of treatment.Biodegradation has not been specified as an alternative technology forhalogenated organics, because they are generally thought of as more difficultto biodegrade than nonhalogenated organic due to the overall higher toxicityof the halogenateds compared to their nonhalogenated counterparts. However,the Agency solicits comment and data that would indicate that the twentyfive specific U and P halogenated organics are similar to the biodegradabilityof other halogenated organics and/or other nonhalogenated organics, andthereby, potentially serving as surrogates or indicators of efficient destruction.While biodegradation is not specifically specified as BDAT, it is not precludedfrom use as part of a treatment train, provided that it is not elsewhereprohibited as land disposal.Carbon adsorption has been specified as part of the treatment train becausethese particular twenty five halogenated U and P organics are believedto be adsorbable when present in low concentrations, as might be expectedin an effluent from either wet air or chemical oxidation.The Agency further recognizes that while difficulties can arise in specifyingonly one treatment method for these wastewaters (as outlined in greaterdetail in section III.A.1.h.(7.)), the Agency must develop a treatmentstandard for these wastes to avoid the hard hammer and at the same time,somehow justify that these technologies provide significant treatment.None of these technologies have been specifically identified as betterthan the others by the Agency because of the lack of data for these specifictwenty five halogenated organic constituents (due to the identified analyticalcomplications) or for any surrogate parameters.<T3>b. Halogenated Aliphatics. </T3>This subcategory of halogenated organicsconsists of six K wastes from the production of various halogenated organicsand nineteen U wastes. The individual waste codes are provided at the beginningof each subheading in this section. EPA grouped these waste codes togetherbecause the primary constituents for which the wastes were listed are halogenatedaliphatic compounds. These compounds are all open chain, alkane or alkenehydrocarbons consisting of up to six carbons, with varying numbers of hydrogenatoms replaced by chlorine. The Agency is proposing to transfer standardsfor the organic constituents in these wastes based in part on this structuralsimilarity. Thus, for purposes of BDAT, the Agency has grouped all of thesewastes into one general treatability group identified as halogenated aliphatics.<T3>(1) K017 and K073 Wastes.</T3><ITAG tagnum="25">K017_Heavy ends (still bottoms) from the purification column in theproduction of epichlorohydrin.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">K073_Chlorinated hydrocarbon waste from the purification step of thediaphragm cell process using graphite anodes in chlorine production.</ITAG>Treatment standards for K017 and K073 wastes were originally scheduledto be promulgated as part of the First Third rulemaking (i.e., they wereto be promulgated by August 8, 1988). The Agency did not promulgate standardsfor K017 or K073 by August 8, 1988, and as a result, land disposal of thesewastes are currently subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions of 40 CFR268.8.Concentration-based treatment standards for all wastewater and nonwastewaterforms of K017 are proposed today based on the transfer of performance datafrom incineration of nonwastewater forms of F024 (wastes from the productionof chlorinated aliphatics such as distillation residues, heavy ends, tars,and reactor clean-out wastes). Treatment standards for F024 were promulgatedwith the Second Third wastes on June 8, 1989 (54 FR 26594 (June 23, 1989)).Concentration-based treatment standards for all wastewater and nonwastewaterforms of K073 are proposed today based on the transfer of performance datafrom incineration of nonwastewater forms of K019 (heavy ends from the distillationof ethylene dichloride in ethylene dichloride production). Treatment standardsfor K019 were promulgated with the First Third wastes on August 8, 1988.The transfer of standards is dependent upon the constituents present ineach waste and the corresponding concentrations and waste characteristicsof K019 and F024. The Agency compared these data to determine which ofthe constituents in each waste most resembled the anticipated treatabilityof the constituents in K017 and K073. Details of the transfers can be foundin the Background Document for K017 and K073 Wastes in the RCRA docket.The Agency reminds commenters that there are very few (if any) of thesewastes that are currently being generated as originally listed and thatin practice, the standards will probably only be necessary for residuesfrom previous disposal. The Agency believes that these residues shouldbe similar or less difficult to treat than the original waste as generated.<T3>(2) K02l Waste.</T3><ITAG tagnum="25">K021_Aqueous spent antimony catalyst from fluoromethane production.</ITAG>Treatment standards for K021 wastes were originally scheduled to be promulgatedas part of the First Third rulemaking (i.e., K021 wastes were to be promulgatedby August 8, 1988). A treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based onNo Generation'' for K021 nonwastewaters was promulgated on August 8, 1988.This standard, however, was subsequently revised on May 2, 1989 (54 FR18836) to be applicable only to ``Nonwastewater forms of these wastes generatedby the process described in the listing description and disposed afterAugust 17, 1988, and not generated in the course of treating wastewaterforms of these wastes [Based on No Generation].'' The Agency did not promulgatestandards for the wastewater forms of K021 by August 8, 1988, and as aresult, land disposal of K021 wastewaters is currently subject to the ``softhammer'' provisions of 40 CFR 268.8.In the proposal for the Second Third wastes (54 FR at 1100 (January 11,1989)), EPA stated its intention to develop concentration-based treatmentstandards for all forms of K021 prior to May 8, 1990, and has thereforedecided to propose to revoke the promulgated treatment standard of ``NoLand Disposal Based on No Generation'' for K021 nonwastewaters. This isbecause there is a reasonable chance that these nonwastewaters may be generated.Concentration-based treatment standards for organics in wastewater andnonwastewater forms of K021 are proposed today based on the transfer ofperformance data from incineration of nonwastewater forms of K019 (heavyends from the distillation of ethylene dichloride in ethylene dichlorideproduction). Treatment standards for K019 nonwastewaters were promulgatedwith the First Third wastes on August 8, 1988. Concentration-based treatmentstandards for antimony in nonwastewater forms of K021 are proposed todaybased on the transfer of performance data from the stabilization of ashfrom the incineration of nonwastewater forms of K048 (dissolved air flotation(DAF) float from the petroleum refining industry) and K051 (API separatorsludge from the petroleum refining industry) wastes.Because the concentration of antimony in the untreated incinerator ashwas relatively low compared to concentrations of antimony that might beexpected in a K021 waste or clean-up residue, the Agency is simultaneouslyproposing a concentration-based standard for antimony nonwastewaters of5.6 ppm, based on the performance of vitrification of arsenic wastes (seesection III.A.5.(a.) of today's notice describing the development of thisarsenic standard for D004 wastes). The Agency believes that this transferof treatment performance data may be appropriate due to the chemical similaritybetween arsenic and antimony. The Agency, however is seeking comment ofwhich standard is more appropriate for K021 waste.The treatment standard for antimony in K021 wastewaters is based on concentrationsfound in the scrubber water from the incineration of K048 and K051. However,additional data are available for the treatment of antimony in wastewatersand as a result the Agency is simultaneously proposing a concentration-basedstandard for antimony wastewaters of 1.9 ppm, based on the performanceof lime precipitation, sedimentation, and filtration (see previous discussionon these additional data in III.A.2.a.(3.) above). Details on the transferscan be found in the Background Document for K02l wastes in the RCRA docket. <T3>(3) K028, K029, K095 and K096 Wastes.</T3><ITAG tagnum="25">K028_Spent catalyst from the hydrochlorinator reactor in the productionof 1,1,1-trichloroethane. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">K029_Waste from the product steam stripper in the production of 1,1,1-trichloroethane.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">K095_Distillation bottoms from the production of 1,1,1-trichloroethane.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">K096_Heavy ends from the heavy ends column from the production of1,1,1-trichloroethane.</ITAG>Treatment standards for K028, K029, K095, and K096 wastes were originallyscheduled to be promulgated as part of the Second Third rule. Treatmentstandards were only promulgated, however, for the wastewater forms of K028and the nonwastewater forms of K028, K029, K095 and K096. Since the Agencydid not promulgate standards for the wastewater forms of K029, K095, andK096 by their statutory deadline, land disposal of these wastewaters arecurrently subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions in 40 CFR 268.8. Initially, the Agency stated that there was no need to develop wastewaterstandards for K029, K095, and K096 because it was unlikely that they werebeing generated due to the recycling and generation practices for thesethree wastes. However, comments were received that indicated that the likelihoodfor their generation was reasonably good. While the Agency agreed withthe commenters, concentration-based treatment standards were not promulgatedbecause none had been proposed. In today's rule, the Agency is proposing concentration-based standardsfor organics in K029, K095 and K096 wastewaters based on the transfer ofperformance data from rotary kiln incineration of K019 (heavy ends fromthe distillation of ethylene dichloride in ethylene dichloride production)nonwastewaters. These treatment standards for organics have been developedsimilar to those promulgated for K028 wastewaters. The Agency is however,proposing to revoke the reserved status for metal standards in K029, K095and K096 <T3>wastewaters.</T3> The Agency has determined that based on waste characterizationdata on the corresponding nonwastewaters, it is believed that these threewastes are essentially all organic and would not be expected to containany BDAT list metal constituents. The Agency stated that it intended to develop standards for metals in <T3>nonwastewater</T3> forms of K028 and propose them with the Third wastesprior to promulgation by May 8, 1990. The Agency reserved standards basedon TCLP analyses for chromium and nickel in the promulgated standards forK028 nonwastewaters. While EPA proposed standards based on stabilizationof K048 and K051 incinerator ash for K028 nonwastewaters as part of theSecond Third proposed rule, the Agency did not promulgate these standardsas proposed because new data on the stabilization of F024 incinerator ashwere developed. However these data were received too late to be promulgatedin the final rule for Second Third wastes (54 FR 26617). The Agency believesthat these new data for stabilized F024 ash more closely resemble whatwould be expected for stabilized K028 ash. Thus, treatment standards formetal constituents in K028 nonwastewaters are proposed today based on thetransfer of TCLP data from stabilization of F024 wastes. These treatmentstandards for metals are simultaneously being proposed for F024 nonwastewatersin today's rule. The Agency will consider all comments on the standardsfor F024 as they also relate to K028 nonwastewaters. <T3>(3) U Wastes for Which EPA is Proposing Concentration-Based Standards.</T3><ITAG tagnum="25">U044_Chloroform </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U074_1,4-Dichloro-2-butene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U076_1,1-Dichloroethane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U077_1,2-Dichloroethane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U078_1,1-Dichloroethylene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U079_1,2-Dichloroethylene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U080_Methylene chloride </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U083_1,2-Dichloropropane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U084_1,3-Dichloropropene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U131_Hexachloroethane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U184_Pentachloroethane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U208_1,1,1,2-Tetrachloroethane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U209_1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U210_Tetrachloroethylene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U211_Carbon tetrachloride </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U226_1,1,1-Trichloroethane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U227_1,1,2-Trichloroethane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U228_Trichloroethylene </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U243_Hexachloropropene</ITAG>In developing the treatment standards for these nineteen halogenated aliphaticU wastes, the Agency reviewed treatability and detection limit data fromseveral different incineration test burns conducted by EPA for variousF and K wastes. These data represented a myriad of different hazardouswastes that were generated and treated at several different incinerationfacilities. The Agency determined that there was substantial treatment data for manyof these halogenated aliphatics from the incineration of K019 and F024.Data from the test burns of both F024 and K019 wastes included detectionlimit information on the majority of the halogenated aliphatic chemicalswhich correspond to these U wastes. The waste characterization data forthe untreated wastes showed concentrations of these halogenated aliphaticconstituents ranging from very low levels in some wastes, to high levelsin others. In general, the majority of the measured values for halogenatedaliphatics in the incinerator residues were approximately at the detectionlimit for all of the constituents analyzed. In the incinerator ash, themeasured values or detection limits ranged from andless;0.005 mg/kg to andless;10mg/kg. In the scrubber water, the measured values or detection limits rangedfrom andless;0.005 ppm to andless;0.05 ppm. The Agency also reviewed new performance data for carbon tetrachloride,methylene chloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, tetrachloroethane and hexachloroethaneobtained from a rotary kiln incinerator test burn EPA performed in June,1989. These five chemicals were specifically selected for this test burnas representatives of all of the U wastes in the halogenated aliphatictreatability group. See details of this test burn previously discussedin section III.A.1.h.(6.) of today's preamble. The Agency believes thatthese new data coupled with the previously mentioned data provide a sufficientrange of concentration of halogenated aliphatic chemicals in untreatedwastes to be considered representative of all halogenated aliphatic U wastes.The Agency has reviewed both characterization and performance data foreach of the halogenated aliphatics present in treated and untreated F024wastes, K019 wastes, and wastes from the June, 1989, EPA incineration testburn, and has determined that the transfer of performance data primarilyfrom the incineration of K019 nonwastewaters is appropriate for the developmentof the concentration-based treatment standards for all halogenated aliphaticwaste codes proposed in today's rule. Details on the development of treatmentstandards can be found in the Background Document for Halogenated Aliphaticsin the RCRA docket. U074, U079 and U084 wastes are listed as 1,4-dichloro-2-butene, 1,2-dichloroethyleneand 1,3-dichloropropene, respectively. Due to the position of the chlorineson these alkenes, all of the chemicals have stereoisomers identified as``cis-'' and ``trans-''. For U074 and U084 wastes both the ``cis-'' andthe ``trans-'' isomers can be quantified using verified SW-846 methods.Therefore, concentration-based treatment standards are being proposed forboth isomers of the two compounds. While 40 CFR 261.33(f) lists U079 wastesas 1,2-dichloroethylene, the chemical abstracts identification number thatis listed for this compound (156-60-5) is specific for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene.Since the trans-isomer is also specified in 40 CFR 261 Appendix VIII, theAgency is thus proposing concentration-based treatment standards only fortrans-1,2-dichloroethylene for U079 wastes. The treatment standards for wastewater forms of the U wastes presentedin the tables following this section, have been calculated based primarilyon the detection limits of these constituents in scrubber waters from incinerationof K019 nonwastewaters. However, additional data are available for thetreatment of these constituents in wastewaters and alternative standardsbased on these data are presented in section III.A.7. of today's noticefor wastewater forms of multi-source leachate.

Halogenated Pesticides and Chlorobenzenes. </T3>This subcategoryof halogenated organics consists of six characteristic D wastes, nine Kwastes from the production of various halogenated pesticides and chlorobenzenes,and twenty six U and P wastes. EPA grouped these waste codes together becausethe primary constituents for which the wastes were listed are halogenatedorganic compounds that are (or have been) primarily used as pesticides.While other halogenated organics have been (or could be) used as pesticides,the Agency has grouped these particular halogenated organics together dueto their similarities in their common use as pesticides, their abilityto be analyzed, and similarities in structure. Thus, for purposes of BDAT,the Agency has grouped all of these wastes into one general treatabilitygroup identified as ``halogenated pesticides and chlorobenzenes''. This subcategory has been further divided into five subcategories basedprimarily on similarities in chemical structure for the purposes of transferringtreatability data. These subcategories include: 1) Chlorinated Norbornaneand Norbornene Derivatives; 2) Chlorobenzenes; 3) ChlorophenoxycarboxylicAcids and Derivatives; 4) Chlorinated Diphenyls; and 5) Lindane and Hexachlorobutadiene.The individual waste codes within each subcategory are provided at thebeginning of each subheading in section III.A.2.c.(3.) of today's preamble.<T3>(1) Availability of Treatment Data for These Wastes</T3>. The Agencyhas determined that only a limited amount of treatability data on halogenatedpesticides and chlorobenzenes exist. In section III.A.1.h.(6.) of today'spreamble, the Agency presented information on an extensive June, 1989 testburn for multiple chemical wastes including several halogenated pesticides.The data obtained from this test burn were used in conjunction with otherexisting incineration data to develop proposed treatment standards forthe pesticides tested. The Agency is also proposing to transfer these performancedata to the remaining untested pesticide wastes.The feed wastes for this test burn included three RCRA hazardous wastesthat contained constituents in the halogenated pesticide and chlorobenzenetreatability group present in concentrations of up to 8% by weight. Thesethree wastes included: (1) a Heptachlor process waste which contained Chlordane,Heptachlor, hexachlorobutadiene and hexachlorocyclopentadiene; (2) a D014(EP Toxic for Methoxychlor) waste; and (3) a D016 (EP Toxic for 2,4-D)waste. Specific details and additional information on the test burn canbe found in the Onsite Engineering Report of the Third Third IncinerationTreatability Test, July, 1989.The Agency is proposing to transfer concentration-based standards fromthese compounds as well as from the other existing data to the remainingD, U, P, and K halogenated pesticide and chlorobenzene waste codes. Moreinformation on the development and transfer of treatment standards forthese wastes can be found in the background document for these wastes inthe RCRA docket.<T3>(2) Treatment Standards for Wastewaters. </T3>The treatment standardsfor wastewater forms of the U wastes presented in the tables followingthis section, have been calculated based primarily on the detection limitsof these constituents in scrubber waters from incineration of nonwastewaterscontaining halogenated pesticides. However, additional data are availablefor the treatment of these constituents in wastewaters and alternativestandards based on these data are presented in section III.A.7. of today'snotice for wastewater forms of multi-source leachate. (See previous discussionson these data and alternative standards in section III.A.1.h.(6.) and III.A.2.a.(3.)).<T3>(3) Regulation of EP Toxic Halogenated Pesticides </T3>The new datafrom EPA's June, 1989 testing of rotary kiln incineration on multiple wastes,including D014 and D016 wastes, (see section III.A.1.h.(6.)) indicate thatall of the halogenated pesticides that were present in the feed can beincinerated to detection limits (as measured using analysis of total constituentconcentrations in both the ash and scrubber water). As a result, concentration-basedstandards that are near the detection limits in their respective media(i.e., wastewaters and nonwastewaters) are being proposed today for allof the halogenated pesticides in the respective U, P, and K wastes of thistreatability group. The Agency believes that the wastes tested representthe most difficult to treat wastes.The Agency is proposing two options for treatment standards for EP Toxichalogenated pesticides wastes (D012, D013, D014, D015, D016 and D017).Based on the aforementioned data, the Agency is proposing one option ofconcentration-based treatment standards based on the ability of incinerationto destroy these pesticides to detection limits. (Note: These proposedstandards are based on the analysis of total constituents rather than analysisof EP or TCLP leachates.) The Agency believes that this provides a consistencyin approach with the proposed treatment standards for the correspondingU, P and K wastes.Because these data indicate that these D pesticides can be incineratedto detection limits, the Agency further believes that compliance with thisstandard can be demonstrated by performing a total constituent analysisof the ash samples for these pesticides rather than performing the moreexpensive and more time-consuming extraction procedure for these pesticides.One can then assume that the total concentration of the pesticide measuredin the incinerator ash corrected for the appropriate dilution factor (whichis part of the extraction procedure protocol) provides a reasonable surrogatefor actual measurement of the concentration in an extract provided thatthe total concentration is expected to be near the detection limit.As discussed in detail in section III.C. of today's preamble, the Agencyhas determined that it may have the authority to establish treatment standardsbelow the characteristic level for these wastes. The Agency is also proposinga second option of limiting the treatment standard for D012, D013, D014,D015, D016 and D017 wastes to their respective characteristic levels. TheAgency believes that the total constituent standards proposed in optionone are preferable in that it assures the public that these chemicals arebeing destroyed to the best levels that are achievable. This comports withthe statutory policy of reducing the uncertainties inherent in hazardouswaste land disposal, as well as specific Congressional directives to destroyhazardous organic constituents, see, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec. S9179 (July 25,1984) (statement of Sen. Chaffee), and results in minimization of threatsto human health and the environment. EPA also finds it anomalous that standardsfor the same pesticides will be lower than the characteristic level whenthe pesticides are disposed in their U or P form, but cannot be so limitedwhen the pesticides are discarded in the EP toxic form. This result doesnot appear to further any statutory policy. The Agency specifically solicitscomments on these two options, and on the policy support for choosing alevel based on the characteristic level.The Agency points out to the commenters that there are not very many ofthese wastes being generated and that although the treatment standardsare based on incineration for these wastes, the use of other technologiesis permitted to achieve these concentration-based standards. In addition,the Agency refers commenters to section III.A.1.g. of today's preamblefor a more complete discussion of other general issues pertaining to allcharacteristic wastes, including these D pesticides.<T3>(4) Discussion of Individual Treatability Groups_(a) Chlorinated Norbornaneand Norbornene Derivatives.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">D012_EP Toxic for Endrin. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">D015_EP Toxic for Toxaphene.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K032_Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of Chlordane.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K033_Wastewater treatment scrubber water from the chlorination ofcyclopentadiene in the production of Chlordane.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K034_Filter solids from filtration of hexachlorocyclopentadiene inthe production of Chlordane.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K041_Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of Toxaphene.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K097_Vacuum stripper discharge from the Chlordane chlorinator in theproduction of Chlordane.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K098_Untreated process wastewater from the production of Toxaphene.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P004_Aldrin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P037_Dieldrin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P050_Endosulfan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P051_Endrin and metabolites</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P059_Heptachlor</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P060_Isodrin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P123_Toxaphene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U036_Chlordane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U130_Hexachlorocyclopentadiene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U142_Kepone</ITAG>The Agency has grouped these eighteen waste codes together because theyall contain or represent halogenated pesticides that have the structuralclassification known as chlorinated norbornane and norbornene derivatives.This classification basically consists of compounds having multicyclical,fused-ring, hydrocarbon structures (one of which being a six-membered ring)that have varying numbers of hydrogen atoms replaced by chlorine, methylgroups or other simple functional groups. Hexachloro- cyclopentadiene andKepone, the compounds for which U130 and U142 were listed, are exceptionsto the norbornene classification since they do not have a six-memberedring in their structure. However, their structures are somewhat similarto the norbornane and norbornene derivatives, and thus, are included inthis subcategory of halogenated pesticides.The Agency has data on incineration of Heptachlor, Chlordane, and hexachlorocyclopentadienethat were used in developing the standards for this subgroup of halogenatedpesticides. The new data from EPA's June 1989 testing of rotary kiln incinerationindicate that Heptachlor, Chlordane and hexachlorocyclopentadiene can beincinerated to detection limits (as measured in both the ash and scrubberwater). As a result, concentration-based standards based on these detectionlimits (using analysis of total constituent concentrations) are being proposedtoday for P059, U036, and U130 wastes. Standards for P004, P037, P050,P051, P060, P123 and U142 are being proposed based on detection limitsfor the corresponding constituents from fourteen incineration treatmenttests.In a similar manner, concentration-based standards have been developedfor the major hazardous constituents anticipated to be present in K032,K033, K034, K041, K097, and K098 wastes. The organic constituents selectedfor regulation in these K wastes are specified in the treatment standardsat the end of this section. Details on the selection of constituents andthe transfer of performance data for these wastes are provided in the backgrounddocument for these halogenated pesticide wastes.As discussed earlier in this section, the Agency is today proposing twosets of concentration-based standards for D012 and D015 characteristicwastes. One set of standards is based on the characteristic levels andthe other set of standards were developed from incineration treatment data.Endosulfan, the compound for which P050 was listed as a hazardous waste,commonly exists as a mixture of two isomers (i.e., Endosulfan I and EndosulfanII). Both can be analyzed by SW-846 Method 8080 for organochlorine pesticides.In fact, analytical laboratories typically report analysis for each. Accordingly,the concentration-based standards for P050 are proposed for EndosulfanI and II. In addition, Endosulfan can be converted to Endosulfan sulfatein environmental samples. The Agency anticipates that Endosulfan sulfate,which is also on the Priority Pollutant List used by the Agency's Officeof Water, will be typically found in the presence of Endosulfan.In a similar manner, Heptachlor (P059) can be commonly converted to Heptachlorepoxide in certain environmental conditions. Again analytical laboratoriestypically report results for Heptachlor and for Heptachlor epoxide (whichis also on the Priority Pollutant List). Accordingly, concentration-basedstandards for P059 are today proposed for Heptachlor and Heptachlor epoxide.P051 is specifically listed in 40 CFR 261.33(e) as ``Endrin and metabolites''.The most common metabolite of Endrin is the Priority Pollutant, Endrinaldehyde. Concentration-based standards for P051 are thus proposed forEndrin and Endrin aldehyde.<T3>(b) Chlorobenzenes.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">K042_Heavy ends or distillation residues from the distillation oftetrachlorobenzene in the production of 2,4,5-T.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K085_Distillation of fractionation column bottoms from the productionof chlorobenzenes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">K105_Separated aqueous stream from the reactor product washing stepin the production of chlorobenzenes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U037_Chlorobenzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U070_1,2-Dichlorobenzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U071_1,3-Dichlorobenzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U072_1,4-Dichlorobenzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U127_Hexachlorobenzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U183_Pentachlorobenzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U185_Pentachloronitrobenzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U207_1,2,4,5 - Tetrachlorobenzene</ITAG>The Agency has grouped these three K wastes and eight U wastes togetherbecause they all contain or are represented by halogenated organics thathave the structural classification known as chlorobenzenes. These chemicalsconsist of one benzene ring with increasing chlorine substitution and theirassociated isomers.The Agency has data on the incineration of all of the chlorobenzenes withthe exception of 1,3-dichlorobenzene. More information on these data canbe found in the background document for these wastes. These data were usedto develop standards for all of the chlorobenzene wastes in this treatabilitygroup. Treatment standards for 1,3-dichlorobenzene were developed fromexamination of detection limit data for this constituent from the fourteenincineration treatment tests.The data indicate that these chemicals can be incinerated to at or neardetection limits for these chemicals, which generally range in the treatmentresiduals from andless;0.005 ppm to andless;10 ppm in the ash and from andless;0.002mg/l to andless;0.013 mg/l in the scrubber water. As a result, EPA is proposingconcentration-based standards based on these detection limits (using analysisof total constituent concentrations) for the organic constituents in thesewaste codes. These incineration data are also the only available treatmentdata for these wastes. More information on the development of these standardscan be found in the background document for these wastes in the RCRA Docket.For K085 wastes the Agency determined that the untreated wastes often containedvarious concentrations of PCBs. As indicated in the proposed rule for SecondThird wastes, there were some indications that some K085 wastes may containgreater than 50 ppm of PCBs. However, the Agency could not verify thatthese levels were always exceeded. Nevertheless, the Agency has decidedto propose concentration-based treatment standards for PCBs for both wastewaterand nonwastewater forms of K085. These standards are listed for seven ofthe common mixtures of PCBs known originally by the brand name of Aroclor(i.e., the proposed standards are listed for Aroclor 1016, 1221, 1232,1242, 1248, 1254, and 1260). If K085 Wastes exceed 50 ppm PCBs, they mustbe incinerated in a TSCA permitted facility (several of the commercialfacilities that are permitted for RCRA wastes are also permitted for PCBcontaminated wastes under TSCA).<T3>(c) Chlorophenoxycarboxylic Acids and Derivatives.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">D016_EP Toxic for 2,4-D</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">D017_EP Toxic for 2,4,5-TP (Silvex)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U240_2,4-D, salts and esters</ITAG>These three waste codes have been grouped together because they contain2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (commonly referred to as 2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxypropionicacid (commonly referred to as 2,4,5-TP), or salts and esters of 2,4-D.All of these chemicals are classified as chlorophenoxy carboxylic acidsor esters. The functional groups common to these compounds are an aromaticring, a carbon-oxygen ester linkage, and several chlorine atoms (two orthree) on the aromatic ring.The Agency has data on the incineration of 2,4-D that were used in developingthe standards for D016 and U240. The data indicate that 2,4-D can be incineratedto detection limits in the ash and in the scrubber water (based on analysisof total constituent concentrations). Detection limit data for 2,4,5-TPin fourteen incineration tests were used in developing treatment standardsfor D017. The Agency is proposing concentration-based standards for thesewastes based on their respective detection limits.According to 40 CFR 261.33(f), wastes identified as U240 are listed forthe presence of 2,4-D or its various salts and/or esters. Because 2,4-Dsalts and esters are not analyzed as 2,4-D, the Agency is today proposing``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' for 2,4-D salts and esters identifiedas U240 nonwastewaters. For the wastewater forms of 2,4-D salts and esters,EPA is proposing a treatment standard of ``Wet Air Oxidation or ChemicalOxidation, Followed by Carbon Adsorption; or Incineration as Methods ofTreatment''. (See discussion on selecting these technologies as BDAT forhalogenated organics in section III.A.2.a.(4.) above.) These wastewatertechnologies are appropriate for these constituents and have been demonstratedand/or promulgated for similar U and P waste codes. The use of other technologiesis not precluded prior to or following the use of these specified technologiesprovided the other technologies do not allow land disposal (i.e., landtreatment). For U240 wastes expected to be simply 2,4-D, the Agency isalso proposing concentration-based standards based on the analysis foronly 2,4-D. Thus, where a facility can reasonably assume that only 2,4-Dis being handled, only the concentration-based treatment standard for 2,4-Dwould be applied. However, should one expect that salts or esters couldbe formed during storage, treatment, or disposal, the U240 wastes wouldhave to be treated according to the standard methodology for salts andesters.As discussed earlier in this section, the Agency is today proposing twosets of concentration-based standards for D016 and D017 characteristicwastes. One set of standards is based on the characteristic levels andthe other set of standards were developed from incineration treatment data.Accuracy data for these compounds from the test burn data indicate a highlyvariable recovery of spiked ash samples. This, coupled with the fact thatU240 is listed as 2,4-D, salts and esters, has led the Agency to simultaneouslypropose an alternative treatment standard of ``Incineration as a Methodof Treatment'' for all three of these wastes. The Agency is specificallysoliciting comment and data on the routine achievability of these standardsfor chlorophenoxy carboxylic acids and esters. In particular, the Agencyis requesting QA/QC data as well as detection limit data (as measured inash samples from the incineration of these or similar wastes) for not only2,4-D and 2,4,5-TP, but also the salts and esters of 2,4-D.<T3>(d) Chlorinated Diphenyls.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">D014_EP Toxic for Methoxychlor</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U038_Chlorobenzilate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U060_DDD</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U061_DDT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U132_Hexachlorophene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U247_Methoxychlor</ITAG>These six waste codes have been grouped together because they all containhalogenated pesticides classified as chlorinated diphenyl compounds. Diphenylsare compounds consisting of two benzene rings attached to a single, commoncarbon atom. (Diphenyls are not to be confused with biphenyls which havethe structure of two benzene rings attached directly to each other.) Thechlorinated diphenyls represented by these waste codes have varying degreesof chlorine substitution on the benzene rings and on the carbon in themiddle.The Agency has data on the incineration of Methoxychlor that were usedin developing the standards for D014 and U247. The data indicate that Methoxychlorcan be incinerated to detection limits in the ash and in the scrubber water.Standards for the remaining waste codes in this treatability group weredeveloped using detection limit data from fourteen incineration treatmenttests. As a result, concentration-based standards based on these detectionlimits (using analysis of total constituent concentrations) are being proposedtoday for U038, U060, U061, U132, and U247 wastes. As with the other characteristicpesticide D wastes, the standard for D014 (Methoxychlor) is being proposedas two sets of concentration-based standards. One set of standards is basedon the characteristic levels and the other set of standards were developedfrom incineration treatment data.DDD and DDT, the compounds for which U060 and U061 were respectively listed,can both exist as one of two isomers (i.e., o,pandmin16;-DDD and p,pandmin16;-DDD;o,pandmin16;-DDT and p,pandmin16;-DDT respectively). All of these isomers canbe analyzed by SW-846 Method 8080 for organochlorine pesticides. Analyticalresults for DDD and DDT are often reported separately for each isomer.However, the predominant isomer for both is the p,pandmin16;- isomer. Becauseof this, the Agency is proposing that the concentration-based standardsfor U060 and U061 are based on the analysis for both isomers. In addition,DDD and DDE are common breakdown products of DDT. Accordingly, the Agencyis today proposing to regulate the two isomers of DDD, DDE and DDT in U061wastes. However, the Agency is soliciting comment on the need to regulatethese waste codes for all isomers of the constituents and their breakdownproducts, and is not precluded from promulgating the standards for onlythe p,pandmin16;- isomers.<T3>(e) Lindane and Hexachlorobutadiene.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">D013_EP Toxic for Lindane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U128_Hexachlorobutadiene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U129_Lindane</ITAG>Lindane (U129) is the gamma- isomer of a class of compounds known as hexachlorocyclohexanes(a cyclic six membered hydrocarbon ring with a chlorine substituted oneach carbon) and is often referred to as ``gamma-BHC'' (Note: BHC is anabbreviation for benzene hexachloride_which is a misnomer because benzeneis not part of the structure). Hexachlorobutadiene (U128) has been placedin this subcategory because it has the same number of chlorine atoms (six)and has a hydocarbon structure consisting of four carbon atoms linked bya conjugated double bond system. Both of these chemicals are thus chlorinatedaliphatics and both were typically used as pesticides or in the productionof pesticides. The three wastes represented by these chemicals have notbeen grouped with the chlorinated aliphatics due to the differences inuse of the compounds. (The chlorinated aliphatics discussed in sectionIII.A.2.a. are typically used as solvents.)The Agency has incineration data for hexachlorobutadiene from the June,1989 test burn. In addition to the data from the June, 1989 test: burn,the Agency has detection limit data for hexachlorobutadiene in ash samplesof K019. These K019 data consists of six sample sets of andless;10 ppm inthe ash and andless;0.01mg/1 in the scrubber water from rotary kiln incineration.As a result, concentration-based standards based on detection limits forhexachlorobutadiene (using analysis of total constituent concentrations)are being proposed today for the U128 and U129.Lindane is the most common isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane (BHC). Typicalcommercial mixtures of Lindane were manufactured such that three otherisomers were present in reasonably high concentrations: alpha-, beta-,and delta-BHC. Analytical results for hexachlorocyclohexane are often reportedfor all four of these isomers (which are also Priority Pollutants). Accordingly,the Agency is today proposing concentration-based standards for all fourisomers for wastes identified as U129. As with the other characteristicpesticide D wastes, the standard for D013 (Characteristic for Lindane)is being proposed as two sets of concentration-based standards. One setof standards is based on the characteristic levels and the other set ofstandards were developed from incineration treatment data.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for

Brominated Organics.<ITAG tagnum="15">P017_Bromoacetone </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U129_Methyl Bromide </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U030_4-Bromophenyl phenyl ether </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U066_1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U067_Ethylene dibromide (EDB) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U068_Dibromomethane </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U225_Bromoform</ITAG>The chemicals represented by these six U wastes and one P waste are allhydrocarbons or oxygenated hydrocarbons that contain the halogen, bromine.The presence of bromine in the structure complicates the evaluation ofincineration for these wastes: The primary complication is the releaseof significant quantities of molecular bromine (Br<T2>2</T2>) from the incineration chambers. Thus, these seven wastes havebeen grouped together and identified as the brominated organics treatabilitygroup. While cyanogen bromide (U246) is also an organic chemical containing bromine,it is not grouped with these other brominated organics due to its instabilityin water under alkaline conditions. It breaks down relatively quickly intosoluble bromide and soluble cyanide. Consequently, the soluble cyanidemust then be treated and thus, the Agency has grouped U246 with the cyanidewastes rather than with these brominated organics. Standards for U246 areproposed in section III.A.6.a.(4.) of today's notice. EPA is proposing concentration-based standards for the six brominated organiccompounds amenable to quantification in waste treatment residuals, namelyU029, U030, U066, U067, U068 and U225. The methodology used to developthese standards differs from that used for other organic U and P wastes.Incineration data from an Office of Toxic Substances burn of ethylene dibromideincluded analysis of ethylene dibromide in the untreated waste as wellas the ash and scrubber water treatment residuals, but did not includeanalysis for any of the other brominated organics. EPA used these datato develop the proposed treatment standards for U067 (EDB) wastes. At thesame time, the Agency is proposing to directly transfer these standardsto U029, U030, U066, U068 and U225 wastes. Bromoacetone (P017) is relatively unstable in water and therefore cannotbe reliably analyzed in wastewaters or other residues where contact withwater might be expected. Based on this relative instability of bromoacetone,the resultant difficulty in analyzing treatment residues for bromoacetone,and the demonstration of incinerability of ethylene dibromide (which ismore difficult to incinerate than bromoacetone), the Agency is proposingto establish ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' as a treatment standardfor P017 nonwastewaters. During the EPA-sponsored rotary kiln incineration of the ethylene dibromidewastes, the Agency determined that certain operating conditions were requiredin order to prevent the release of toxic bromine gas. In order to oxidizethe bromine released in the organobromine compound combustion process tosoluble bromide which can be removed effectively with an air pollutioncontrol device such as a scrubber, sulfur was added to modify flame stoichiometryto form soluble bromide rather than molecular bromine gas. These specificconditions are outlined in the background document for these wastes.Federal regulations currently do not limit the amount of bromine emittedto the air. The Agency is specifically soliciting comment and data on whetherthese particular incinerator operating conditions can or should be specifiedas part of the incineration requirements for these wastes. The Agency recognizesthat different incinerators have different designs, and that the conditionsidentified in the test burn may not be reasonably extrapolated to otherincinerators. As an alternative to specifying these conditions, the Agency is also consideringestablishing a maximum bromide level in the feed to the incinerators forthese seven brominated organic wastes and thereby establish a blendingrequirement. However, the Agency has not identified a maximum level forbromide and thus has not determined the resultant blending requirementsfor these seven brominated organics. Another alternative to achieve thesame results may be to establish an overall maximum loading of the concentratedbrominated organics in the incinerator feed stream. The Agency is therefore soliciting comment and data that would assist theAgency in determining the viability of these alternative standards forthese wastes. Specifically, the Agency solicits supporting evidence onconcentrations of bromine in waste feeds that have been successfully incineratedincluding substantiation that emissions of bromine gas do not pose significantrisk to human health and the environment. This information should includespecific design and operating conditions established to prevent these emissionsand/or specific established restrictions (either regulatory or companypolicy) on the concentrations of total bromine in waste feeds. Prospectivecommenters are referred to section III.A.1.i. for explanation of the specialprocedures that the Agency intends to utilize to provide additional rapidnotice and comment on any new data and information received prior to theclosure of the comment period and should identify their interest in receivingnotice on data for brominated organics specifically as III.A.2.e. The Agency is currently investigating recent information suggesting thatconcentrated brominated organics can be processed through a specific thermalunit designed to break off the bromine for purposes of recovery of bromine.Sufficient details of this process were not available in time to describeit in this proposal. While the Agency may not be able to identify thisprocess as BDAT in time for promulgation of the final rule, it is not precludedfrom establishing this as BDAT sometime in the future. Finally, the Agencyreiterates that in-plant recycling preceding disposal is nowhere prohibitedunder RCRA. The treatment standards for wastewater forms of these U wastes presentedin the tables following this section, have been calculated based on thedetection limits of these constituents in scrubber waters from incinerationof the ethylenedibromide wastes. However, additional are available forthe treatment of some of these constituents in wastewaters (see previousdiscussion in section III.A.2.a.(3.) on the proposed promulgation of standardsbased on these additional data) and will probably be used for the promulgationof the final standards. While the Agency currently lacks data indicating the treatability of bromoacetone(P017) in water, its relative instability in water supports the inferencethat it should easily be destroyed with any chemical oxidant and most probablyat ambient temperature and air pressure. Since wet air oxidation is typicallyoperated at relatively high temperatures and pressures, the Agency believesthat wet air oxidation should provide a more efficient oxidation than simplechemical oxidation. In order to ensure complete destruction, the Agencyis therefore proposing that wet air oxidation represents BDAT for P017wastewaters. However, because bromoacetone is relatively unstable in water,the Agency is also proposing chemical oxidation as an alternative methodof treatment. The Agency also believes that incineration, while not always practicalfor wastewaters, will provide an efficient destruction of P017 wastewaters.Since the Agency does not want to preclude the use of incineration forP017 wastewaters, it is also being proposed as an alternative treatmenttechnology. In a similar manner, while the Agency currently lacks data on the biodegradabilityof bromoacetone in wastewaters, biodegradation typically results in oxidationof organics. Again, due to the instability of this compound in water, theAgency believes that biodegradation can provide effective removal of P017from wastewaters. EPA thus is also proposing biodegradation as an alternativetreatment method. Since the Agency must specify  treatment for P017 wastewatersand currently has no data or means of determining which of the wastewatertreatment technologies can provide the most effective treatment and sincethe technologies can theoretically provide efficient treatment for thisrelatively unstable compound, the Agency is proposing all four treatmenttechnologies as BDAT.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>U029, U030, U066, U067, U068, U225<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">U029 <D>Methyl Bromide </D><D>15 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U030 <D>4-Bromopheny phenyl ether </D><D>15 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U066 <D>1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane </D><D>15 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U067 <D>Ethylene dibromide (EDB) </D><D>15 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U068 <D>Dibromomethane </D><D>15 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U225 <D>Bromoform </D><D>15</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,6,r50,10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>U029, U030, U066, U067, U068, U225<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] \1\</ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">U029 <D>Methyl Bromide </D><D>16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U030 <D>4-Bromophenyl phenyl ether </D><D>16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U066 <D>1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane </D><D>16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U067 <D>Ethylene dibromide (EDB) </D><D>16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U068 <D>Dibromoethane </D><D>16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U225 <D>Bromoform </D><D>16  </D><F>\1\ Note: Alternative standards for these U and P wastewaters are alsoproposed and are presented in section III.A.7. as standards for the correspondingchemical in wastewater forms of Multi-source Leachate.

Miscellaneous Halogenated Organics.</T3> EPA has grouped all ofthe remaining halogenated organics (i.e., twenty-six U wastes and ten Pwastes) together into a general category identified as miscellaneous halogenatedorganics. These U and P wastes represent a wide range of chemicals producedin a variety of individual processes. In general, these miscellaneous halogenatedorganics can be further distinguished by similarities in structure as werethe previously mentioned halogenated organic treatability groups. To facilitatedeveloping appropriate treatability standards, EPA thus divided this generalcategory into seven subcategories: 1) chlorinated diphenyls; 2) chlorinatedpolynuclear aromatics; 3) chlorinated amines, amides, and nitriles; 4)chlorinated methylbenzenes; 5) halogenated aliphatics; 6) halogenated aldehydes,ethers and esters; and 7) halogenated organo-sulfur compounds. EPA examined data from a total of fourteen test burns that were performedduring the course of determining BDAT standards for First Third and SecondThird wastes plus data generated in a rotary kiln incinerator test burnEPA performed in June, 1989. (See section III.A.1.h.(6.) of today's preamblefor a more complete discussion of this test burn.) These data include analysisof untreated wastes and all residues, including ash and scrubber water,for virtually all the compounds which the BDAT program regulates by meansof concentration-based standards (the ``BDAT List'' compounds) includingthe miscellaneous halogenated compounds in this subcategory. However, formost of these compounds the only data that were available were detectionlimits. In today's notice, EPA is proposing concentration-based standards for fourteenof these thirty-six miscellaneous halogenated organic U and P nonwastewatersbased on a transfer from other ``surrogate'' halogenated constituents thatwere determined to be similar in structure to the compounds within eachsubcategory of miscellaneous halogenated organics. EPA believes that nonwastewaterforms of all thirty-six miscellaneous halogenated U and P compounds canbe destroyed by incineration to detection limits. However, the Agency doesnot have specific data on the direct incineration of the majority of thesemiscellaneous halogenated U and P wastes or their corresponding constituents.The treatment standards for wastewater forms of these U and P miscellaneoushalogenated organics presented in the tables following this section, havebeen calculated based on the detection limits of these constituents orsurrogate halogenated organics in scrubber waters from incineration. However,additional data are available for the treatment of these constituents inwastewaters and alternative standards based on these data are presentedin section III.A.7. of today's notice for wastewater forms of multi-sourceleachate. (See previous discussions on these data and alternative standardsin section III.A.1.h.(6.) and III.A.2.a.(3.)). For twenty-two of these miscellaneous halogenated organics there are analyticalcomplications that preclude the establishment of concentration-based treatmentstandards. (See complete discussion of analytical complications for U andP wastes in section III.A.1.h.(2.) of today's preamble.) In addition, thequality of the data and resultant concentration-based standard for U017(benzal chloride) is being re-examined to determine whether the concentration-basedstandard is valid. As a result EPA is specifying ``Incineration as a Methodof Treatment'' for nonwastewater forms of twenty-three of these miscellaneoushalogenated organic wastes and ``Wet Air Oxidation or Chemical Oxidation,Followed by Carbon Adsorption; or Incineration as Methods of Treatment''for the corresponding wastewater forms. (See discussion on selecting thesetechnologies as BDAT for halogenated organics in section III.A.2.a. (2.)and (4.) above.) The specified technologies are appropriate for these constituentsand have been demonstrated and/or promulgated for similar halogenated organicU and P waste codes. The Agency reminds commenters that there are veryfew (if any) of these twenty-three wastes that are currently being generatedas originally listed and that in practice, the standards will probablyonly be necessary for residues from previous disposal. The Agency believesthat these residues should be less difficult to treat than the originalwaste as generated. <T3>(1) Chlorinated Diphenyls.</T3> There are two miscellaneous halogenatedorganics that are classified as chlorinated diphenyls; 3,3andmin16;-dichlorobenzidine(U073) and 4,4-methylene-bis-(2-chloroaniline) (U158). Diphenyls are compoundsconsisting of two benzene rings attached to a single, common carbon atom.(Diphenyls are not to be confused with biphenyls which have the structureof two benzene rings attached directly to each other.) The chlorinateddiphenyls represented by these waste codes differ from those previouslymentioned in the halogenated pesticide category (e.g., DDD, DDT, and Methoxychlor)because these diphenyls contain fewer chlorine atoms and also include methyleneand amine functional groups. DDD, DDT, and Methoxychlor are believed to be more difficult to destroythan the U073 and U158 because the chlorines at the carbon bridge in DDD,DDT, and Methoxychlor are believed to stabilize the aromatic ring. TheAgency has data on the incineration of wastes containing Methoxychlor andanother structurally similar halogenated organic known as Pronamide (U192)that were used in developing the standards for U073 and U158 wastes. TheAgency believes that Pronamide, a halogenated organo-nitrogen compound(3,5-dichloro N-(1,1-dimethyl-2-propynyl)- benzamide), is more difficultto incinerate than these two chlorinated diphenyls. Both of the chemicals represented by U073 and U158 are amenable to quantificationin treatment residuals by verified SW-846 methods. EPA believes these canboth be incinerated to detection limits in ash and scrubber water basedon data indicating that DDD, DDT and methoxychlor can be incinerated todetection levels. Therefore EPA is proposing concentration-based standardsfor U073 and U158 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. <T3>(2) Chlorinated Polynuclear Aromatics.</T3> Chloronaphazine (U026)and 2-chloronaphthalene (U047) are both classified as chlorinated polynucleararomatic hydrocarbons. This means that both chemicals contain fused aromaticrings (i.e., polynuclear aromatics) with one having only one attached chlorinewhile the other has an attached chlorinated amine functional group. TheAgency believes that both U026 and U047 can be incinerated to detectionlimits in ash and scrubber water because of their similarity to Pronamide.The Agency believes that Pronamide, a halogenated organo-nitrogen compound(3,5-dichloro N-(1,1-dimethyl-2-propynyl)-benzamide), is more difficultto incinerate than these chlorinated polynuclear aromatics. Therefore,EPA is proposing treatment standards for U026 and U047 based on incinerationas BDAT. Only U047 is amenable to quantification in treatment residuals by verifiedSW-846 methods. While chloronaphazine (U026) is amenable to analysis byHPLC, EPA currently rejects HPLC methods as the sole means of establishingtreatment standards for reasons discussed in III.A.1.h.(2.). EPA is thereforeproposing concentration-based standards for all forms of U047, ``Incinerationas a Method of Treatment'' for nonwastewater forms of U026, and ``Wet AirOxidation or Chemical Oxidation, Followed by Carbon Adsorption; or Incinerationas Methods of Treatment''. (See discussion on selecting these technologiesas BDAT for all halogenated organics in section III.A.2.a.(4.) and in theintroductory discussion for miscellaneous halogenated organics above.)<T3>(3) Chlorinated Amides, Amines, and Nitriles.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">P024_p-Chloroaniline</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P027_3-Chloropropionitrile</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P057_2-Fluoroacetamide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U049_4-Chloro-o-toluidine hydrochloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U097_Dimethylcarbomyl chloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U192_Pronamide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U222_o-Toluidine hydrochloride</ITAG>These seven miscellaneous halogenated organics were grouped together becausethey contain an amide, amine, or nitrile group attached to a relativelysimple hydrocarbon structure. Only p-chloroaniline (P024) and Pronamide(U192) are amenable to quantification in treatment residuals by verifiedSW-846 methods. EPA has data on the incineration of Pronamide that indicatePronamide can be incinerated to detection levels in the ash and the scrubberwater. Thus, concentration-based standards for U192 nonwastewaters areproposed in today's notice based directly on these data. The Agency believesp-chloroaniline (P024) resembles Pronamide closely enough that incinerationwill also destroy p- chloroaniline to detection limits, and is thereforeproposing concentration-based standards for P024 based on a transfer ofthese data.While 2-fluoroacetamide (P057) is amenable to analysis by HPLC, EPA currentlyrejects HPLC methods as the sole means of establishing treatment standardsfor reasons discussed in III.A.1.h.(2.). In addition, no analytical methodshave been verified for 4-chloro-o-toluidine hydrochloride (U049), dimethylcarbomylchloride (U097), or 3-Chloropropionitrile (P027). Information also indicatesthat o-Toluidine hydrochloride (U222) is unstable in water. EPA believesincineration is effective for P027, P057, U049, U097 and U222, becausethree are halogenated aliphatics and expected to be less stable than Pronamide(an aromatic molecule), and the other two are polar aromatics, similarin stability to Pronamide. Thus EPA is proposing a standard of ``Incinerationas a Method of Treatment'' for P027, P057, U049, U097 and U222, based onthe incineration data for Pronamide.For the wastewater forms of P027, P057, U049, U097 and U222, EPA is proposinga treatment standard of ``Wet Air Oxidation or Chemical Oxidation, Followedby Carbon Adsorption; or Incineration as Methods of Treatment''. (See discussionon selecting these technologies as BDAT for halogenated organics in sectionIII.A.2.a.(4.) above.) These wastewater technologies are appropriate forthese constituents and have been demonstrated and/or promulgated for similarhalogenated U and P waste codes.<T3>(4) Chlorinated Methylbenzenes.</T3> Benzyl chloride (P028) and benzalchloride (U017) have been grouped together because they both consist ofa toluene moiety with chlorines attached to the methyl group. In sectionII.A.6.(d.) of today's notice EPA is proposing concentration-based standardsfor benzal chloride in K015 wastes (still bottoms from the distillationof benzyl chloride) based on a transfer of K019 incineration data for p-dichlorobenzene.Wastewater standards for benzal chloride in K015 wastewaters were promulgatedwith the First Third Wastes. Therefore, the Agency is proposing these treatmentstandards for U017 wastewaters and nonwastewaters based on a similar transfer.Benzal chloride (U017) is relatively unstable in water and the Agency isconcerned that the analysis for this compound in treatment residuals maynot be reproducible. As an alternative to the concentration-based standardfor U017 nonwastewaters, the Agency is also proposing ``Incineration asa Method of Treatment'' as BDAT. Commenters on this approach should submitQA/QC data that verify their particular position of this matter. The Agencypoints out that it currently has no QA/QC data that support the reproducibilityof the benzal chloride analysis for treatment residues, and that the Agencyprefers to establish a method of treatment rather than a concentration-basedstandard for U017 wastewaters and nonwastewaters.In a similar manner, benzyl chloride (P028) is unstable in water. The Agencyis thus proposing a standard of ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment''for P028 nonwastewaters, based on the incineration data that indicatesp-dichlorobenzene and Pronamide can be destroyed to detection levels inincinerator ash. Both of these chemicals are more stable than P028.For the wastewater forms of U017 and P028, EPA is also proposing a treatmentstandard of ``Wet Air Oxidation or Chemical Oxidation, Followed by CarbonAdsorption; or Incineration as Methods of Treatment''. (See discussionon selecting these technologies as BDAT for halogenated organics in sectionIII.A.2.a.(4.) above.) These wastewater technologies are appropriate forthese constituents and have been demonstrated and/or promulgated for similarU and P waste codes.<T3>(5) Halogenated Aliphatics.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">U043_Vinyl chloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U045_Chloromethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U075_Dichlorodifluoromethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U121_Fluorotrichloromethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U138_Iodomethane</ITAG> This subcategory of miscellaneous halogenated organics consists of fivechemicals that have been grouped together because they have one or twocarbon atoms with at least one chlorine, fluorine, or iodine attached.EPA believes that 1,1,1-trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride, whichalso contain one or two carbons with three or four chlorines attached,represent the degree of difficulty anticipated in incinerating the simplehalogenated aliphatics belonging to this subgroup. While the carbon-fluoridebonds in U075 and U121 are known to be much stronger than the carbon-chlorinebond in carbon tetrachloride molecule, EPA believes that the overall degreeof difficulty of incineration is similar enough to justify a transfer ofthese incineration data for the purposes of developing treatment standardsfor land disposal of these wastes.Thus, EPA concludes incineration will reduce these wastes to detectionlimits in ash and scrubber water and is proposing concentration-based standardsaccordingly. Since all five of these compounds are amenable to quantificationin treatment residuals by verified SW-846 methods, EPA is proposing concentration-basedstandards for wastewater and nonwastewater forms of U043, U045, U075, U121and U138.<T3>(6) Halogenated Aldehydes, Ethers and Esters.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">P016_Bis-chloromethyl ether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P023_Chloroacetaldehyde</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P058_Fluoroacetic acid, sodium salt</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P095_Phosgene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U006_Acetyl Chloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U024_Bis 2-chloroethoxymethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U025_Dichloroethyl ether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U027_Bis-2-chloroisopropyl ether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U033_Carbonyl fluoride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U034_Trichloroacetaldehyde</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U04I_n-Chloro-2,3-epoxypropane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U042_2-Chloroethyl vinyl ether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U046_Chloromethyl methyl ether</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U156_Methyl chlorocarbonate</ITAG>This subcategory of miscellaneous halogenated organics consists of fourteenchemicals grouped together because they are relatively simple oxygenatedhydrocarbons with various degrees of halogenation. The oxygenated hydrocarbonsinclude ethers, esters, and aldehydes.Of these fourteen chemicals, only bis 2-chloroethoxymethane (U024), dichloroethylether (U025), bis-2-chloroisopropyl ether (U027), and 2-chloroethyl vinylether (U042) are amenable to quantification in treatment residuals by verifiedSW-846 methods. However, EPA's data on the detection limits of 2-chloroethylvinyl ether (U042) in incinerator ash are so variable that the resultantcalculated treatment standard results in a standard that is in the lowpercent range. Since the data show that incineration can achieve detectionlimits for a variety of wastes, and since the resultant high treatmentstandard could potentially allow a waste with high concentrations of U042to go untreated; the Agency has chosen to propose ``Incineration as a Methodof Treatment'' as a treatment standard for U042 nonwastewaters. The Agencybelieves that this will ensure these wastes will be treated to levels thatrepresent BDAT. For U024, U025, and U027 (which are also amenable to quantification)EPA is proposing concentration-based standards based on the ability ofincineration technologies to destroy Pronamide and chlorobenzene to detectionlimits in ash and scrubber water. The Agency believes that Pronamide (ahalogenated organo-nitrogen compound also identified as 3,5-dichloro N-(1,1-dimethyl-2-propynyl)-benzamide)and chlorobenzene are more difficult to incinerate than these halogenatedsbecause both have more complex structures and stronger bonding than U024,U025, and U027 wastes.There are currently no verified SW-846 methods for the constituents representedby P058, U034, or U156. In addition, constituents represented by P016,P023, P095, U006, U033, U041, and U046 are all unstable in water. As aresult, EPA is proposing ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' as treatmentstandards for nonwastewater forms of P016, P023, P058, P095, U006, U033,U034, U041, U042, U046, and U156. Based on the simplicity of structure,EPA believes all of these compounds are easier to incinerate than chlorobenzeneand/or Pronamide. This is particularly substantiated by the aforementionedrelative instability of seven of these U and P wastes.For the wastewater forms of P016, P023, P058, P095, U006, U033, U034, U041,U042, U046, and U156, EPA is proposing a treatment standard of ``Wet AirOxidation or Chemical Oxidation, Followed by Carbon Adsorption; or Incinerationas Methods of Treatment''.

The majority of theorgano-sulfur compounds are discussed in section III.A.3. of today's preamble.Note: The Agency is soliciting comment on the potential need for controlof sulfur dioxide emissions from the incineration of these wastes.The Agency is proposing a standard of ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment''in nonwastewaters for all four of these wastes. While P026 and U062 areamenable to analysis by HPLC, EPA currently rejects HPLC methods as thesole means of establishing treatment standards for reasons discussed in``Analytical Considerations''. In addition, no verified SW-846 analyticalmethods are available for the constituents represented by P118 or U020.The Agency bases this choice of incineration as a method on the incinerationdata that indicates 1,1,1-trichloroethane as well as tetrachloroethene,Pronamide, and chlorobenzenes can all be destroyed to detection levelsin incinerator ash and scrubber water.For the wastewater forms of P026, Pl18, U020, and U052, EPA is proposinga treatment standard of ``Wet Air Oxidation or Chemical Oxidation, Followedby Carbon Adsorption; or Incineration as Methods of Treatment''.

Proposed Treatment Standards for Additional Organic Wastes_a. Introduction.</T3>In the previous section of today's preamble (III.A.2.), the Agency identifiedthat many of the chemicals represented by the U, P, and K wastes fall undera general category of chemicals known as halogenated organics. The majorityof the remaining organic U and P wastes have been grouped together intoseven additional subcategories of ``nonhalogenated'' organic wastes anda discussion of each is presented in this section (III.A.3.) of today'spreamble. The seven major subcategories of wastes are based primarily onsimilarities in the structure of these organic chemicals (i.e., elementalcomposition and the presence of organic functional groups). These subcategoriesare also based partially on the industrial use (e.g., the wastes of a pharmaceuticalnature) and waste generation patterns of the U and P wastes. These majorsubcategories include: aromatics and other hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatichydrocarbons, phenolics, oxygenated hydrocarbons and heterocyclics, organo-nitrogencompounds, organo-sulfur compounds, and wastes of a pharmaceutical nature.<T3>(1) Fuel Substitution as an Alternative Treatment Method.</T3> BDATstandards for the nonwastewater forms of these U and P nonhalogenated organicsare proposed based primarily on performance data from incineration of similarwastes. Since many of the nonhalogenated chemicals represented by theseU and P waste codes generally have reasonably high BTU values (e.g., thearomatics and the polynuclear aromatics) and since U and P wastes are typicallyoff-specification or discarded products, they might be expected to be wellsuited for fuel substitution purposes. However, despite this fuel valueand the fact that these compounds consist primarily of hydrogen and carbon,many of these wastes may be considered unacceptable for fuel substitutiondue to their relatively high toxicity and acid formation capability (dueincineration). In addition, it appears that there is sufficient incinerationcapacity to accommodate these wastes, so that use of fuel substitutioncapacity is not needed to avoid granting a national capacity variance forthese wastes. It also appears that only the oxygenated hydrocarbons andheterocyclics (seventeen of the eighty two U and P nonhalogenated wastes)are likely candidates for use as fuel substitutes. The Agency does notbelieve that fuel substitution is a viable alternative for the majority(sixty five) of the specific U and P waste codes identified in this section.In today's rule, the Agency is proposing that incineration represents BDATfor all of the nonhalogenated organics presented in this section. Wherethe Agency is proposing ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' as thenonwastewater treatment standard for a particular organic waste code, ithas not included fuel substitution as an alternative except for seventeenof the oxygenated hydrocarbon and heterocyclic wastes. However, where theAgency has proposed concentration-based standards (i.e., sixty one U andP nonhalogenated wastes), thermal destruction in fuel substitution unitsis not precluded. The Agency points out that all facilities incineratingthese wastes must comply with 40 CFR 264 Subpart O or 265 Subpart O.<T3>(2) Additional Wastewater Treatment Data.</T3> Additional wastewatertreatment data primarily from the Agency's Office of Water have been recentlyanalyzed for incorporation into the treatment standards for many of theU and P wastes in this section. These data include the treatment of wastewatersthat are not specifically listed as U or P wastewaters, but do containmany of the corresponding U or P constituents. While these data were notavailable in time to incorporate into this discussion or into the backgrounddocument for these wastes, these data are being placed in the administrativerecord for today's notice. Therefore, the Agency is not precluded fromusing these data in promulgating the standards for these wastes. Furtherinformation on these data can be found in section III.A.1.h.(6.).Alternative standards based on these data are anticipated to be similarto those presented in section III.A.7. of today's notice for wastewaterforms of multi-source leachate. These standards are presented on a constituentbasis and correspond to what may be promulgated for the respective U orP wastewater. Thus, the Agency is proposing these standards as alternativestandards for all U and P wastewaters for which concentration-based standardsbased on incinerator scrubber waters have been proposed in the followingsections.<T3>(3) Specifying Technologies for Nonhalogenated Wastewaters.</T3>  Basedon analytical complications previously discussed in section III.A.1.h.(2.),the Agency is also proposing certain methods of treatment as the treatmentstandards for many of the nonhalogenated U and P wastewaters. In the followingsections (III.A.3.b. through h.) of the preamble the Agency identifieseighty two specific nonhalogenated organic U and P wastes for which theAgency is proposing four treatment technologies as alternative BDAT treatmentstandards: (1) Wet air oxidation followed by carbon adsorption; (2) Chemicaloxidation followed by carbon adsorption; (3) Biodegradation followed bycarbon adsorption; or (4) Incineration of wastewaters. Since these technologiesare known to provide effective treatment for the other nonhalogenated organicconstituents within each treatability group (as identified in III.A.3.)that can be analyzed, the Agency is therefore proposing these multipletreatment technologies for all of the eighty two U and P constituents thatrequire specified methods of treatment.Biodegradation has been specified as an alternative technology for thesenonhalogenated organics in wastewaters, because these chemicals are generallythought of as more easily biodegraded than the halogenated organics dueto the overall higher toxicity of the halogenateds compared to their nonhalogenatedcounterparts. This is further supported by the fact that there are certainforms of biota that utilize the nitrogen or the sulfur contained in manyof these nonhalogenated organics for metabolic purposes and that the hydrogen,carbon, and oxygen contained in the majority of the structures of thesechemicals serve as a food source for many forms of the biota.Carbon adsorption has been specified as part of the treatment train becausethe eighty two nonhalogenated U and P organics are believed to be adsorbablewhen present in low concentrations, as might be expected in an effluentfrom either wet air oxidation, chemical oxidation, or biodegradation. TheAgency further recognizes that while difficulties can arise in specifyingonly one treatment method for these wastewaters (as outlined in greaterdetail in section III.A.l.h.(7.)), the Agency must develop a treatmentstandard for these wastes to avoid the hard hammer and at the same time,somehow justify that these technologies provide significant treatment.None of these technologies have been specifically identified as betterthan the others by the Agency, because of the lack of data for these constituents(due to the identified analytical complications) or for any surrogate parameters.<T3>b. Aromatics and Other Hydrocarbons</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">U019_Benzene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U055_Cumene (isopropyl benzene)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U056_Cyclohexane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U186_1,3-Pentadiene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U220_Toluene (methyl benzene)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U239_Xylenes (dimethyl benzenes)</ITAG>EPA grouped these waste codes together because the primary constituentsfor which the waste was listed are either aromatic or alicyclic compounds.This group of chemicals, except for cyclohexane (U056) and 1,3-Pentadiene(U186), all contain one benzene ring. Cumene (U055), toluene (U220), andxylenes (U239) consist of a benzene ring with aliphatic side chains. Cyclohexane(U056), a cycloalkane, has been included in this group because of its abilityto be converted by catalytic reforming into aromatic hydrocarbons. Conversely,the addition of hydrogen (hydrogenation) to an aromatic compound yieldscyclic aliphatic compounds, specifically cyclohexane derivatives, e.g.,the hydrogenation of benzene yields pure cyclohexane. 1,3-pentadiene (U186)is a five carbon chain with two conjugated double bonds (i.e., a diene)that provide a certain degree of aromaticity to the chemical, making itsomewhat similar to the others in the group. For the purpose of determiningBDAT, all of these wastes have been grouped together into one treatabilitygroup identified as aromatics and other hydrocarbons. The proposed treatmentstandards for this waste group are presented expressed either as a concentration-basedstandard or as a method of treatment.<T3>(1) Wastes for Which EPA is Proposing Concentration-Based Standards.</T3>In developing the standards for aromatics and other hydrocarbon wastes,the Agency incorporated into its analysis some chemical variability byreviewing data from several incineration test burns conducted by EPA forvarious F and K wastes. Analysis of these data identified extensive treatmentand detection limit data for benzene (U019), toluene (U220), and xylenes(U239) from the test burns of K001, K037, K048, K051, K087, K101, and K102wastes. These data represent a myriad of different hazardous waste typesgenerated and treated at several different facilities. The waste characterizationdata indicates that for these three constituents, concentrations in thedifferent wastes varied from very low levels in some wastes to high levelsin others. For example, toluene concentrations in the wastes ranged from17 ppm in K087 waste to 2,000 ppm in K037 waste.Concentration-based treatment standards for U019, U220 and U239 wastesare thus proposed based on the analysis of data on the performance of incinerationof: (1) K001 (bottom sediment sludge from the treatment of wastewatersfrom wood preserving processes that use creosote and/or pentachlorophenol);(2) K037 (wastewater treatment sludges from the production of disulfoton);(3) K048 (dissolved air flotation (DAF) float from the petroleum refiningindustry); (4) K051 (API separator sludge from the petroleum refining industry);(5) K087 (decanter tank tar sludge from coking operations); (6) K101 (distillationtar residues from the distillation of aniline-based compounds in the productionof veterinary pharmaceuticals from arsenic or organo-arsenic compounds)and (7) K102 (residue from the use of activated carbon for decolorizationin the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals from arsenic or organo-arseniccompounds) wastes.Treatment standards for K001, K037, K048, K051, K087, K101 and K102 wastewatersand nonwastewaters were promulgated in the First Third final rule on August8, 1988. These standards, measured as concentrations found in the ash andscrubber water, were based on the performance of rotary kiln or fluidizedbed incineration.EPA analyzed for benzene (U019), toluene (U220) and xylenes (U239) in theincineration residues (ash and scrubber water) from these test burns asfollows: (1) six data sets for benzene and toluene in K001; (2) six datasets for xylene in K037; (3) six data sets for benzene and toluene in K048and K051; (4) six data sets for benzene, toluene and xylene in K087; (5)six data sets for toluene in K101 and (6) six data sets for toluene andxylene in K102. In general, data from the test burns showed that the majorityof the measured values for the three aromatic constituents were analyzedat concentrations below detection levels in the incineration residues.Detection limits for the ash ranged from 0.005 ppm to 10 ppm. The detectionlimits for the scrubber water ranged from 0.002 ppm to 0.010 ppm.The Agency also reviewed performance data on the treatment of toluene andxylenes obtained from a rotary kiln incinerator test burn EPA performedin June, 1989. The feed also included other RCRA hazardous wastes thatcontained these constituents yielding total concentrations of these constituentsat the percent level. (See further discussion of this test burn in sectionIII.A.1.h.(6.) of today's preamble.)The Agency believes that all of these data represent a sufficient rangeof concentrations of these aromatic hydrocarbons in the untreated wastesand are thus considered representative of what the Agency would anticipateto find present in the respective U wastes. The Agency has reviewed bothcharacterization and performance data from all seven test burns to developconcentration-based treatment standards for U019, U220, and U239 and hasdetermined, as explained in the background document, that K001 is mostappropriate for the transfer to these U wastes.The Agency is regulating xylenes (U239) by setting a single concentration-basedtreatment standard which will represent the sum of the concentrations ofo-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene present in the waste treatment residual.The basis of concentration numbers therefore will be the sum of the areasunder all peaks identified as o-xylene, m-xylene or p-xylene in the chromatographicspectrum. The forthcoming first update to the third edition of SW-846 includesMethod 8260 (GC/MS for volatile organics using a capillary column) whichcan quantify the individual isomers of xylene. Nevertheless, the Agencychooses to regulate xylenes as a collective unit, rather than individually,to allow the regulated community to use SW-846 Method 8240 because it isalready validated for xylenes, less cumbersome and available in currenteditions of SW-846. More information on the development of treatment standardscan be found in the Background Document for Aromatic Compounds in the RCRAdocket.<T3>(2) Wastes for Which EPA is Proposing a Method of Treatment as BDAT.</T3>The Agency does not believe that concentration-based standards can be establishedfor U055, U056 and U186 wastes at this time. The major problem in establishingconcentration-based standards for these wastes is that EPA does not currentlyhave a verified SW-846 analytical method that can analyze for the concentrationsof cumene (U055), cyclohexane (U056), or 1,3-pentadiene (U186) in treatmentresidues. As a result, a concentration-based treatment standard for thesewaste codes is apparently not feasible and thus, the Agency is proposinga treatment standard of ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' for U055,U056 and U186 nonwastewaters. For U055, U056 and U186 wastewaters, EPAis proposing ``Wet Air Oxidation or Chemical Oxidation, Followed by CarbonAdsorption; Biodegradation Followed by Carbon Adsorption; or Incinerationas a Method of Treatment.'' These wastewater technologies are appropriatefor these constituents and have been demonstrated and/or promulgated forsimilar U and P waste codes (see preceding discussion in III.A.3.a.(3.)).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,xls24,r25,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>U019, U220, <T4>and</T4> U239<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Waste code</H1><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">U019<D>Benzene</D><D>36</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U220 <D>Toluene</D><D>28</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U239 <D>Xylene(s)</D><D>33</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,xls24,r25,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>U019, U220, <T4>and </T4>U239<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] \1\ </ITAG><H1>Waste code</H1><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">U019<D>Benzene</D><D> 0.033</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U220<D>Toluene</D><D> 0.028</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U239<D>Xylene(s)</D><D> 0.032 </D><F>\1\ Note: Alternative standards for these U and P wastewaters are alsoproposed and are presented in section III.A.7. as standards for the correspondingchemical in wastewater forms of Multi-source Leachate.

Analysis of these data identified extensive treatabilityand detection limit data for many polynuclear aromatic constituents fromthe test burns of F024, K001, K019, K048, K051, and K087 wastes. Thesedata represent a myriad of different hazardous waste types generated andtreated at several different facilities. The characterization data foruntreated wastes indicate that concentrations of these polynuclear aromaticsvaried from very low levels in some wastes to high levels in others. Forexample, chrysene waste concentrations ranged from 0.41 ppm in F024 to6500 ppm in K087.Concentration-based treatment standards for U005, U018, U022, U050, U063,U120, U137, U157, and U165 wastes are thus proposed based on data on theperformance of incineration of: (1) F024 (various wastes from the productionof chlorinated aliphatics such as distillation residues, heavy ends, tars,and reactor clean-out wastes); (2) K001 (bottom sediment sludge from thetreatment of wastewaters from wood preserving processes that use creosoteand/or pentachlorophenol); (3) K019 (heavy ends from the distillation ofethylene dichloride in ethylene dichloride production); (4) K048 (dissolvedair flotation (DAF) float from the petroleum refining industry); (5) K051(API separator sludge from the petroleum refining industry); and (6) K087(decanter tank tar sludge from coking operations) nonwastewaters.Treatment standards for K001, K019, K048, K051, and K087 wastewaters andnonwastewaters were promulgated in the First Third rule on August 8, 1988.Treatment standards for F024 wastes were promulgated in the Second Thirdrule on June 8, 1989. These standards, measured as concentrations foundin the ash and scrubber water, were based on the performance of rotarykiln or fluidized bed incineration.EPA analyzed for various polynuclear aromatic compounds in the incinerationresidues (ash and scrubber water) from these test burns as follows: (1)six data sets for benz(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, chrysene, and indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrenein F024; (2) six data sets for benz(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, chrysene,fluoranthene, and naphthalene in K001; (3) six data sets for naphthalenein K019; (4) six data sets for benz(a)anthracene, chrysene, and naphthalenefor K048; (5) six data sets for benz(a)anthracene, chrysene, and naphthalenein K051; and (6) six data sets for benz(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, chrysene,fluoranthene, indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrene and naphthalene in K087. In general,the majority of the measured values for polynuclear aromatics were belowdetection for the six constituents analyzed. The Agency has determined that the waste characterization and incinerationperformance data from F024, K001, K019, K048, K051, and K087 wastes weresufficient to develop concentration-based treatment standards for U005,U018, U022, U050, U063, U064, U120, U137, U157, and U165 wastes. Whilespecific data were not available on all of these polynuclear aromatic chemicals,EPA is proposing concentration-based standards for the remaining wastesbased on a transfer of performance data from structurally similar polynucleararomatics where data do exist. More information on the development of treatmentstandards for these wastes can be found in the Background Document forPolynuclear Aromatic Compounds in the RCRA docket.<T3>(2) Standards for U051 Waste. </T3>Treatment standards for U051 (creosote)wastes are proposed based on the transfer of performance data from incinerationof K001 wastes. Treatment standards for K001 wastewaters and nonwastewaterswere promulgated in the First Third final rule on August 8, 1988. The standardsfor organics in K001 wastes were based on the performance of rotary kilnincineration of K001 nonwastewaters. Treatment standards for the leachablemetal constituents in K001 nonwastewaters were established based on theperformance of stabilization. The metal constituents in K001 wastewaterswere based on chemical precipitation.The Agency is also proposing to revise the concentration-based treatmentstandards for K001 organics due to a mathematical error that was made inthe calculation of the standards. The revised standards are being proposedalong with the corrected standards for U051. Additional information onthe revised standards can be found in the amendment to the K001 BackgroundDocument.U051 wastes differ from other U wastes in the polynuclear aromatic groupin that the waste is not defined by one chemical or constituent, but bya group of chemicals defined by the generic term of ``creosote''. Creosoteis a derivative of coal that contains a wide range of constituents includingcresols, phenols, naphthalene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, fluoranthene,chrysene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and acenaphthalene. The presence of thesepolynuclear aromatics is the main reason why this waste code has been placedin this treatability group. The transfer of performance data from K001 waste is particularly appropriatefor U051 because data on the incineration of a K001-creosote waste anda K001-pentachlorophenol waste were used in the development of the treatmentstandards for that waste. Based on the similarities in concentration ofthe major hazardous organic constituents anticipated in creosote (U051)to those in K001, and the primary use of creosote as a wood preservative(and hence the relationship to K001) the Agency has decided to proposeto regulate the same constituents in U051 as were regulated in K001.Incineration in a rotary kiln will achieve a level of performance thatrepresents BDAT for the organics in U051. Thus, EPA is proposing concentration-basedstandards for six organic constituents in U051. These are naphthalene,pentachlorophenol, phenanthrene, pyrene, toluene, and xylenes. Since theperformance data for K001 indicate the presence of treatable quantitiesof lead in the incinerator ash and based on the anticipated similaritiesof U051 wastes to K001 wastes, EPA is also proposing treatment standardsfor lead. These standards are based on stabilization as BDAT for U051 nonwastewatersand chemical precipitation as BDAT for U051 wastewaters.EPA notes, however, that if U051 is simply discarded before it is used,for example because it is off-specification, then it would be unlikelyto have all of the same contaminants as K001 wastes. On the other hand,when U051 is spilled at a wood preserving site, then it could contain thesame contaminants, in particular pentachlorophenol and lead, as K001 wastesdue to the high potential for cross-contaminated due to prior use of pentachlorophenolat the site. Since the Agency anticipates that most of the U051 wastescome from spill residues at wood preserving sites, EPA is conservativelyproposing standards that include those constituents that are likely tobe present in this form of the waste. In situations where a facility neverused pentachlorophenol or where the U051 is only anticipated to be generatedas an off-spec product (and pentachlorophenol was never used in the productionequipment), EPA anticipates that the facility's waste analysis plan couldbe revised so that only the constituents that are likely to be presentin that form of the waste are monitored. (See also the discussion in sectionIII.A.1.f.(3.) on waste analysis plans.)<T3>(3) Wastes for Which EPA is Proposing a Method of Treatment as BDAT.</T3>The Agency has determined that currently there are no calibrationreagents that are routinely available for the measurement of benzo(c)acridine(U016), 1,2,7,8-dimethylbenzo(a) anthracene (U064) and 7,12-dimethylbenzo(a)anthracenein treatment residuals. As a result, a concentration-based standard forthese constituents is apparently not feasible. See section III.A.1.h.(2.)(b.)of today's preamble for a further discussion of the Agency's approach insuch instances. Since 3004(m) allows the Agency to establish either levelsor methods of treatment, the Agency is proposing a standard of ``Incinerationas a Method of Treatment'' for U016, U064 and U094 nonwastewaters. ForU016, U064, and U094 wastewaters the Agency is proposing ``Wet Air Oxidationor Chemical Oxidation Followed by Carbon Adsorption; Biodegradation Followedby Carbon Adsorption; or Incineration as a Methods of Treatment.'' TheAgency believes that these technologies are appropriate for treatment ofthese constituents and have been demonstrated and/or promulgated for similarU and P waste codes (see preceding discussion in III.A.3.a.(3.)).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>U005, U018, U022, U050, U063, U120,U137, U157, <T4>and </T4>U165 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">U005 <D>2-Acetylaminofluorene </D><D>13 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U018 <D>Benz(a)anthracene </D><D>3.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U022 <D>Benzo(a)pyrene </D><D>3.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U050 <D>Chrysene </D><D>3.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U063 <D>Dibenzo(a,h)anthracene </D><D>13 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U120 <D>Fluoranthene </D><D>3.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U137 <D>Indeno(1,2,3,-c,d)pyrene </D><D>3.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U157 <D>3-Methylchloanthrene </D><D>33 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U165 <D>Naphthalene </D><D>5.9</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,6,r25,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>U005, U018, U022, U050, U063, U120,U137, U157, <T4>and </T4>U165 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] \1\ </ITAG><H1>Waste Code </H1><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">U005 <D>2-Acetylaminofluorene </D><D>0.058 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U018 <D>Benz(a)anthracene </D><D>0.030 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U022 <D>Benzo(a)pyrene </D><D>0.030 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U050 <D>Chrysene </D><D>0.15 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U063 <D>Dibenzo(a,h)anthracene </D><D>0.012 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U120 <D>Fluoranthene </D><D>0.030 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U137 <D>Indeno(1,2,3,-c,d)pyrene </D><D>0.030 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U157 <D>3-Methylchloanthrene </D><D>0.58 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U165 <D>Naphthalene </D><D>0.007 </D><F>\1\ Note: Alternative standards for these U and P wastewaters are alsoproposed and are presented in section III.A.7. as standards for the correspondingchemical in wastewater forms of Multi-source Leachate.

These compounds are further divided into two subcategoriesbased on whether or not a nitro group (NO<T2>2</T2>) is attached to the phenolic compound. EPA selected one compound that is representative of the treatability ofboth subcategories for the purpose of transferring standards. Dinoseb isa representative of the nitrophenolics and phenol is a representative ofthe other phenolics. Because the representative wastes are so similar tothe other wastes in this treatability group, the Agency is proposing totransfer treatment performance data to the other waste codes they representin each subcategory with the exception of P034, as discussed at the endof this section.<T3>(1) P020, P047, P048, U101, U170, U188, and U201.</T3> The Agency hasperformance data on the treatment of Dinoseb and phenol obtained from arotary kiln incinerator test burn EPA performed in June, 1989. The feedincluded three hazardous wastes and fifteen commercial chemical productsrepresenting a number of treatability groups. Dinoseb and phenol were presentin the waste feed at concentrations of 8.9% and l.4%, respectively. (Moreinformation on the test burn can be found in section III.A.1.h.(6.) oftoday's preamble as well as in the Onsite Engineering Report of the ThirdThird Incineration Treatability Test, July, 1989).Additional treatment data exist for phenol and p-cresol. The wastes forwhich these data exist include: (1) K001 (bottom sediment sludge from thetreatment of wastewaters from wood preserving processes that use creosoteand/or pentachlorophenol); (2) K019 (heavy ends from distillation of dichloridein ethylene dichloride production); (3) K022 (distillation bottom tarsfrom the production of phenol/acetone from cumene); (4) K087 (decantertank tar sludge from coking operations); and (5) K102 (residue from theuse of activated carbon for decolorization in the production of veterinarypharmaceuticals from arsenic or organoarsenic compounds).These data represent different waste types containing phenol and p-cresolthat were treated by incineration. Six sample sets were analyzed in K001,nine in K019, six in K022, and five samples in K102. In general, phenoland p-cresol were treated to the detection limits in the ash and scrubberwater. The detection limits ranged from 0.50 ppm to 3.8 ppm for the ash,and 0.002 mg/l to 0.023 mg/l for the scrubber water. The concentrationsin the untreated waste ranged from 4 ppm to 1000 ppm.These data, along with the data from the June, 1989 test burn, were usedto develop concentration-based standards for nonwastewater forms of P020,P047, P048, U101, U170, U188, and U201. These incineration data are alsothe only available treatment data for these wastes.The Agency is in the process of conducting wastewater treatment tests forwastewater forms of these wastes using wet air oxidation, PACT (powderedactivated carbon treatment), and carbon adsorption. These data are availablein the administrative record for today's notice. Where the Agency has actualwastewater treatment data, it prefers to use that data rather than usescrubber water concentrations to develop wastewater treatment standards.Today's concentration-based wastewater standards are based on incineratorscrubber water.<T3>(2) P034.</T3> Because no calibration standard exists for 2-cyclohexyl-4,6-dinitrophenol (P034), the compound cannot be routinely analyzed. When theAgency is unable to set a concentration-based treatment standard, the Agencyprefers to set a method of treatment. Thus, the Agency is proposing a standardof ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' for P034 nonwastewaters. Thisis justified because of the structural similarity between 2-cyclohexyl-4,6-dinitrophenoland 2-sec-Butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol (P020_Dinoseb), and because the Agencyhas data on P020 demonstrating incineration can achieve detection limitsfor these phenolics.For P034 wastewaters the Agency is proposing ``Wet Air Oxidation or ChemicalOxidation, Followed by Carbon Adsorption; Biodegradation Followed by CarbonAdsorption; or Incineration as Method of Treatment.'' The Agency believesthat these technologies are appropriate for treatment of P034 and havebeen demonstrated and/or promulgated for similar phenolics (see also precedingdiscussion in III.A.3.a.(3.)).<T3>(3) P047.</T3> According to 40 CFR 261.33(e), wastes identified asP047 are listed for the presence of 4,6-dinitrocresol and salts. Becausethese salts are not analyzed as 4,6-dinitrocresol, the Agency is todayproposing standards of ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' for P047nonwastewaters identified as ``salts of 4,6-dinitrocresol'' and ``Wet AirOxidation or Chemical Oxidation, Followed by Carbon Adsorption; BiodegradationFollowed by Carbon Adsorption; or Incineration as Methods of Treatment''for P047 wastewaters identified as ``salts of 4,6-dinitrocresol''. Thisis justified because of the structural similarity between 4,6- dinitrocresoland 2-sec-Butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol (P020_Dinoseb), and because the Agencyhas data on P020. (See preceding discussion in sections III.A.3.a.(3.)on specifying treatment for wastewaters containing nonhalogenated organicsand the related discussion of treatment standards for U240 wastes (2,4-D,salts and esters) in section III.A.2.c.(4.)(c.).)For P047 wastes expected to be simply 4,6-dinitrocresol, the Agency isalso proposing concentration-based standards based on the analysis foronly 4,6-dinitrocresol. Thus, where a facility can reasonably assume thatonly 4,6-dinitrocresol is being handled, only the concentration-based treatmentstandard for 4,6-dinitrocresol would be applied. However, should one expectthat salts or esters could be formed during storage, treatment, or disposal,the P047 wastes would have to be treated by the specified methods dependingupon the form of the waste.<T3>(4) U052.</T3> U052 is listed as ``cresols (cresylic acid)''. Cresylicacid is the name given to a mixture of three isomeric cresols (methyl phenols),in which the meta-cresol predominates. Thus, U052 typically contains variouslevels of ortho-cresol, meta-cresol and para-cresol. Analytical methodsare usually reported for o-cresol and a combination of m- and p-cresol,because m-cresol and p-cresol cannot be distinguished by the analyticalmethod. Thus, the Agency is today proposing concentration-based standardsfor U052 based on an analysis for o-cresol and the mixture of m-cresoland p-cresol.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>P020, P047, P048, U052, U101, U170,U188, <T4>and </T4>U201<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">P020 <D>2-sec-Butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol. </D><D>2.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P047 <D>4,6-dinitrocresol (incineration for salts)</D><D>140</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P048 <D>2,4-dinitrophenol </D><D>140</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U052 <D>o-Cresol </D><D>5.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U052 <D>Cresol (m- and p-isomers)</D><D> 3.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U101 <D>2,4-Dimethyl phenol </D><D>14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U170 <D>4-Nitrophenol </D><D>65</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U188 <D>Phenol </D><D>6.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U201 <D>Resourcinol </D><D>1.8</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,6,r25,5.4 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>P020, P047, P048, U052, U101, U170,U188, <T4>and </T4>U201<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]\1\</ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">P020 <D>2-sec-Butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol </D><D>0.036</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P047 <D>4,6-dinitrocresol (wet air/carbon for salts) </D><D>0.18</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P048 <D>2,4-dinitrophenol </D><D>0.18</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U052 <D>o-Cresol </D><D>0.0066</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U052 <D>Cresol (m- and p- isomers) </D><D>0.028</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U101 <D>2,4-Dimethyl phenol </D><D>0.045</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U170 <D>4-Nitrophenol </D><D>0.18</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U188 <D>Phenol </D><D>0.091</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U201 <D>Resourcinol </D><D>8.2 </D><F>\1\ Note: Alternative standards for these U and P wastewaters are alsoproposed and are presented in section III.A.7. as standards for the correspondingchemical in wastewater forms of Multi-source Leachate.

The hydrocarbons contain at least one oxygen atom integratedinto the chemical structure by a single or double bond to a carbon. Asa result, this group includes functional groups such as ketones, aldehydes,and alcohols. These compounds are also distinguished from other nonhalogenatedorganics by the absence of nitrogen, sulfur, and/or phosphorous in theirelemental composition.<T3>(1) Wastes for Which Concentration-Based Standards are Proposed asBDAT. </T3>The Agency has identified incineration or fuel substitutionas an applicable technology for treatment of nonwastewater forms of P003(wastewaters), U002, U004, U031, U057, U108, U112, U117, U118, U140, U159,U161, U162, U166, and U197 wastes. While the Agency has been unable toobtain performance data based on incineration or fuel substitution forthese particular U and P wastes, the Agency is aware that many facilitiesgenerating these wastes also incinerate them prior to land disposal. Therefore,the Agency believes incineration and fuel substitution are BDAT for theseU and P wastes. As a result, EPA is proposing concentration-based treatmentstandards for these wastes based on the transfer of available incinerationperformance data on these constituents (or structurally similar constituents)as they appear in other RCRA hazardous wastes. Detailed information forEPA's rationale and the source of performance data for each waste are providedin the BDAT Background Document for U and P Hydrocabon and Heterocyclicwastes.The Agency notes that the primary constituents for which U031, U112, andU117 are listed as hazardous wastes in the 40 CFR 261.33 (n-Butanol, ethylacetate, and ethyl ether respectively) were not originally considered BDATList Constituents. The primary constituents of these wastes are now consideredBDAT List Constituents because EPA has identified several EPA SW-846 TestMethods that may be able to quantify them in wastewaters. The identifiedEPA SW-846 Test Methods are as follows: 8015 for U031 (GC/MS) and 8240for both U112 (direct injection_GC/MS) and U117 (Purge and Trap_GC/MS).As a result, the Agency urges facilities that are unable to meet the proposedconcentration based treatment standards to submit comments addressing theuse of these EPA SW-846 test methods or test methods that are used routinelyby them. The treatment standards for wastewater forms of the U wastes presentedin the tables following this section, have been calculated based primarilyon the detection limits of these constituents in scrubber waters. However,additional data are available for the treatment of these constituents inwastewaters and alternative standards based on these data are presentedin section III.A.7. of today's notice for wastewater forms of multi-sourceleachate. (See previous discussions on these data and alternative standardsin section III.A.1.h.(6.) and III.A.3.a.(2.)).<T3>(2) Wastes for Which the Agency is Proposing a Method of Treatmentas BDAT. </T3>The Agency had identified incineration and fuel substitutionas BDAT for treatment of nonwastewaters forms of P001, P003, P005, P088,P102, U001, U008, U053, U085, U113, U122, U123, U124, U125, U126, U147,U154, U182, U213, and U248 wastes. For various reasons outlined in thebackground document for these wastes, all of these chemicals except P003and U154 currently lack analytical methods that can satisfactorily analyzefor their constituents of concern in complex waste matrices. Thus, as discussedin detail in section III.A.1.h.(2.) of today's preamble, the Agency isproposing a standard of ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' for theseU and P nonwastewaters. For wastewater forms of these wastes, the Agency is proposing ``Wet AirOxidation or Chemical Oxidation, Followed by Carbon Adsorption; BiodegradationFollowed by Carbon Adsorption; or Incineration as a Methods of Treatment.''The Agency believes that these technologies are appropriate for treatmentof these constituents and have been demonstrated and/or promulgated forsimilar U and P waste codes (see preceding discussion in III.A.3.a.(3.)).<T3>(3) Standards for P003 and U154 Wastes. </T3>EPA's limited data onthe detection limits of acrolein (P003) in incinerator ash are highly variable.Since these data do show that incineration can achieve detection limitsfor acrolein in a variety of wastes, and since a high treatment standardcould potentially allow a waste with high concentrations of P003 to gountreated; the Agency has chosen to propose both ``Incineration as a Methodof Treatment'' P003 nonwastewaters. For methanol (U154) EPA lacks characterizationdata from incineration ash or scrubber water. However, EPA believes thatmethanol can be effectively treated by incineration based on the informationthat other alcohols of higher molecular weight can be incinerated. As aresult, EPA is proposing ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' forU154 nonwastewaters and wastewaters. EPA notes that it prefers promulgationof a concentration-based standard for reasons discussed in section III.A.l.a.and therefore is soliciting comment and data that could be used as additionalsupport for the establishment of an achievable concentration-based standardfor acrolein and methanol in P003 and U154 wastes, respectively.The main reason that the Agency lacks data on methanol is that it typicallyutilizes data for volatile compounds that are obtained through the analysisof samples by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The mass spectrumof methanol is difficult to distinguish from other low molecular weightspecies. Therefore the quantification of methanol by GC/MS techniques isdifficult and as a result methanol is not routinely analysed.The Agency is aware of GC methods that can analyze for methanol in wastewaters;however, it currently has no data for the analysis of nonwastewaters usingGC methods. Additional data primarily from the Agency's Office of Waterare available for the treatment of alcohols similar to methanol in wastewaters.A concentration-based standard for methanol in wastewater forms of multi-sourceleachate has been calculated using these data and is presented in sectionIII.A.7. of today's notice. (See previous discussions on these data andalternative standards in section III.A.1.h.(6.) and III.A.2.a.(3.)). TheAgency may promulgate this standard for U154 wastewaters based on a transferof these data. The Agency specifically solicits comment and data that supportthe establishment of a concentration-based standard for U154 wastes.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> U002, U004, U031, U057, U108, U112,U117, U118, U140, U159, U161, U162, U166, <T4>and</T4> U197<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">U002 <D>Acetone </D><D>0.14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U004 <D>Acetophenone </D><D>9.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U031 <D>n-Butanol </D><D>2.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U057 <D>Cyclohexanone </D><D>1.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U108 <D>1,4-Dioxane </D><D>280</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U112 <D>Ethyl acetate </D><D>5.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U117 <D>Ethyl ether </D><D>140</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U118 <D>Ethyl methacrylate </D><D>160</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U140 <D>Isobutanol </D><D>170</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U159 <D>Methyl ethyl ketone </D><D>200</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U161 <D>Methyl isobutyl ketone </D><D>33</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U162 <D>Methyl methacrylate </D><D>160</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U166 <D>1,4-Naphthoquinone </D><D>1.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U197 <D>p-Benzoquinone </D><D>180</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,6,r25,8.2</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4> P003, U002, U004, U031, U057, U108,U112, U117, U118, U140, U159, U161, U162, U166, <T4>and</T4> U197<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] \1\  </ITAG><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">P003 <D>Acrolein </D><D>3.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U002 <D>Acetone </D><D>0.25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U004 <D>Acetophenone </D><D>0.17</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U031 <D>n-Butanol </D><D>0.56</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U057 <D>Cyclohexanone </D><D>1.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U108 <D>1,4-Dioxane </D><D>0.80</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U112 <D>Ethyl acetate </D><D>0.0052</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U117 <D>Ethyl ether </D><D>0.28</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U118 <D>Ethyl methacrylate </D><D>0.47</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U140 <D>Isobutanol </D><D>1.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U159 <D>Methyl ethyl ketone </D><D>0.14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U161 <D>Methyl isobutyl ketone </D><D>0.028</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U162 <D>Methyl methacrylate </D><D>0.47</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U166 <D>1,4-Naphthoquinone </D><D>0.073</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U197 <D>p-Benzoquinone </D><D>13</D><F>\1\ Note: Alternative standards for these U and P wastewaters are alsoproposed and are presented in section III.A.7. as standards for the correspondingchemical in wastewater forms of Multi-source Leachate.

Organo-Nitrogen Compounds.</T3> EPA has grouped eleven P wastesand thirty seven U wastes together into a single general treatability category,identified as organo-nitrogen compounds. These P and U wastes representa wide range of chemicals produced in a variety of individual processes.EPA's reasons for grouping these organic chemicals together is that theyall contain nitrogen and do not contain chlorine or any other halogen.To facilitate transferring appropriate treatability data, EPA further dividedthis category into six subgroups based on structure, giving functionalgroup similarities particular priority. These subgroups are: (1) NitrogenHeterocyclics; (2) Amines and Amides; (3) Nitrogen-Bearing Diphenyls; (4)Nitriles; (5) Nitro Compounds and (6) Nitroso Compounds.<T3>(1) Concentration-based Standards for Organo-Nitrogens.</T3> In today'snotice, EPA is proposing concentration-based standards for these U andP nonwastewaters based on a transfer of performance data from other ``surrogate''organo-nitrogen constituents that were determined to be similar in structureto the compounds within each subcategory of organo-nitrogen compounds.As a result, EPA believes all of these U and P constituents can be destroyedby incineration to detection limits. However, the Agency does not havespecific data on the direct incineration of the majority of these specificU and P wastes or their corresponding constituents.The concentration-based treatment standards for wastewater forms of theseU and P organo-nitrogen compounds presented in the tables following thissection, have been calculated based primarily on the detection limits ofthese constituents (or surrogates) as measured in scrubber waters fromincineration of nonwastewaters containing these organo-nitrogen constituents.However, additional data are available for the treatment of these constituentsin wastewaters and alternative standards based on these data are presentedin section III.A.7. of today's notice for wastewater forms of multi-sourceleachate. (See previous discussions on these data and alternative standardsin section III.A.1.h.(6.) and III.A.2.a.(3.)).<T3>(2) Technology-based Standards for Organo-Nitrogens.</T3> The Agencyhas determined that currently there are considerable difficulties in analyzingmany of these organo-nitrogen compounds. As a result, concentration-basedstandards for these constituents are apparently not feasible. See sectionIII.A.1.h.(2.)(b.) of today's preamble for a further discussion of theAgency's approach in such instances. Since 3004(m) allows the Agency toestablish either levels or methods of treatment, the Agency is proposinga standard of ``Incineration as a Method of Treatment'' for the nonwastewaterforms and ``Wet Air Oxidation or Chemical Oxidation Followed by CarbonAdsorption; Biodegradation Followed by Carbon Adsorption; or Incinerationas a Methods of Treatment'' for wastewaters. The Agency believes that thesetechnologies are appropriate for treatment of these constituents and havebeen demonstrated and/or promulgated for similar U and P waste codes (seepreceding discussion for wastewaters in III.A.3.a.(3.)).The Agency reminds commenters that there are very few (if any) of thesewastes that are currently being generated as originally listed and thatin practice, the standards will probably only be necessary for residuesfrom previous disposal. The Agency believes that these residues shouldbe less difficult to treat than the original waste as generated. EPA alsorequests comment on the choice of transfer data for concentration-basedstandards and on the validity of the subgroupings used to assign standards.<T3>(3) Potential Air Emission Concerns with Organo-Nitrogens.</T3> Becausethe Agency expects that the incineration of these organo-nitrogen compoundsmay adversely impact air quality due to the emission of nitrogen oxides,EPA is considering the need to impose additional air quality controls onthe incineration of these wastes, either under RCRA or under the CleanAir Act. For a more complete discussion of the alternatives under consideration,see the discussion of organo-sulfur compounds later in this section.<T3>(4) Discussion of Individual Treatability Groups_(a) Nitrogen HeterocyclicCompounds.</T3><ITAG tagnum="25">P008_4-Aminopyridine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">P018_Brucine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">P054_Aziridine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">P067_2-Methylaziridine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U011_Amitrole</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U148_Maleic Hydrazide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U179_N-Nitrosopiperidine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U180_N-Nitrosopyrrolidine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U191_2-Picoline</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U196_Pyridine</ITAG>This subgroup consists of ten wastes grouped together because they containa ring of carbon atoms which also includes a nitrogen atom. Three havearomatic rings, six have rings made of single bonds. Only N-nitrosopiperidine(U179), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (U180), and pyridine (U196) are amenab1e toquantification in treatment residuals by SW-846 methods. Therefore, EPAis proposing concentration-based standards for only these three wastesin this treatability subcategory. EPA believes incineration will reduceU179, U180 and U196 to detection limits in ash and scrubber water becauseof the Agency's incineration data that indicate destruction to detectionlevels of Pronamide. The Agency believes that Pronamide, a halogenatedorgano-nitrogen compound (3,5-dichloro N-(1,1-dimethyl-2-propynyl)-benzamide),is more difficult to incinerate than these ten nitrogen-containing heterocycles.Based on this, the Agency is also proposing specified methods of treatmentfor both wastewater and nonwastewater forms of the seven members of thenitrogen heterocyclic subcategory which are not amenable to quantificationin waste treatment residual matrices. P054, P067, U011 and U048 are amenableonly to analysis by HPLC. (Note: EPA rejects HPLC methods for waste treatmentresidual matrices for reasons discussed in section III.A.1.h.(2.)(a.).)For P008, P018, and U191 there are no verified SW-846 analytical methodsavailable.

Four of these wastes are amenable to quantification in wastetreatment residual matrices by current SW-846 methods: acrylamide (U007),aniline (U012), 1-naphthylamine (U167), and 2-naphthylamine (U168); however,the Agency does not have adequate analytical data characterizing incineratorash and scrubber water to set concentration-based standards based on detectionlimits for U007. Therefore, EPA is proposing concentration-based treatmentstandards only for U012, U167 and U168 nonwastewaters. These standardsare based on data showing how 4-nitrophenol can be incinerated to detectionlimits in ash and scrubber water. EPA believes that 4-nitrophenol is moredifficult to incinerate than the amines and amides identified as in thistreatability group.In a similar manner, for P046, P064, U092, U110, U194, and U238 (the sixmembers of the amines and amides subcategory not amenable to quantification)_plusU007 which can be quantified but for which no analytical data is available_EPAis proposing treatment standards based on incineration as BDAT. U007 andU238 have amide groups and thus are easier to incinerate than 4-nitrophenol,which has been proven to be treated to detection levels by incineration.P064 has an amide-like structure with an attached nitrile group, wherethe nitrogen has a double bond to a carbonyl group which appears to bemore amenable to destruction by incineration than 4-nitrophenol or pronamide.P046, U092, U11O, and U194, have amine groups which are more easily destroyedby incineration than nitro-groups.Six wastes in this treatability group are not amenable to quantificationfor the following reasons: (1) calibration reagents are not commerciallyavailable for P046 and P064; (2) U238 is only quantifiable by HPLC methods(Note: EPA rejects HPLC methods for waste treatment residual matrices forreasons discussed in section III.A.1.h.(2.)(a.).); and (3) for U092, U110and U194 there are no verified SW-846 analytical methods available.

The concentration based treatment standards for U093 wastewatersand nonwastewaters are proposed based on incineration to detection limitstransferred from data showing that methoxychlor (a chlorinated diphenylbelieved to be more difficult to incinerate) and Pronamide can be destroyedto detection limits in incinerator ash and scrubber water.EPA believes U014, U021, U091, U095 and U236 can be effectively incineratedfor the same reason as U093. For these remaining five members of the aminateddiphenyls and biphenyls subcategory, in addition to U091 and U095, EPAis proposing treatment standards based on incineration as BDAT.

Some also contain nitrogen and/or oxygenin their structure. EPA is proposing treatment standards as specified methodsfor all eighteen of these organo-sulfur compounds. While several of theseorgano-sulfurs are amenable to quantification in waste treatment residualmatrices by current SW-846 analytical methods, the Agency has not obtainedany data characterizing either treated or untreated organo-sulfur wastes.In addition, the Agency has not determined a surrogate compound from whichto transfer concentration-based standards. The other members of the Organo-Sulfur treatability group are not amenableto quantification in waste treatment residual matrices because there areno verified SW-846 analytical methods available. The specified methodsproposed as wastewater and nonwastewater treatment standards for all organo-sulfurU and P wastes are the same as those for all of the organo-nitrogen subcategories.These technologies are presented in section III.A.3.f.(3.) as they relateto organo-nitrogens. The Agency also points out that many of these compounds have very offensiveor strong odors associated with them. In fact, the Agency attempted toinclude benzene thiol (Thiophenol-P014) and carbon disulfide (P022) asrepresentatives of this treatability group in its massive test burn (seediscussion of this burn in section III.A.1.h.(6.)(a.)), however permittingproblems arose (due to the odors specifically associated with these compounds)that could not be solved in a reasonable time frame. This jeopardized thecompletion of the test burn, so the Agency had to drop these chemicalsfrom the list of chemicals to be burned. However, the Agency does believethat these odor problems could have been resolved with appropriate technicalprecautions (given the Agency had had more time). These odor problems alsopresent a interesting reason for specifying technologies rather than concentration-basedstandards, i.e., the less handling of these compounds, the better. (Note:In case the reader has had no experience with these compounds, methanethiol (U153) has the distinct odor of rotten cabbage.) EPA believes that these compounds are all amenable to treatment by incinerationbecause they resemble aliphatic, aromatic and other organic compounds thathave been successfully treated by incineration. EPA requests comments onthe choice of incineration as the method of treatment for organosulfurwastes. Specifically, the Agency solicits supporting evidence on concentrationsof sulfur in waste feeds that have been successfully incinerated. Thisinformation should include specific design and operating conditions establishedfor incineration of these specific organo-sulfur compounds and/or specificestablished restrictions (either regulatory or company policy) on the concentrationsof total sulfur in waste feeds. Prospective commenters are referred tosection III.A.1.i. for explanation of the special procedures that the Agencyintends to utilize to provide additional rapid notice and comment on anynew data and information received prior to the closure of the comment periodand should identify their interest in receiving notice on these data as``Organosulfur Wastes III.A.3.g.''. The Agency is concerned, however, with the potential nitrogen and sulfuremissions generated from the incineration of these wastes. The formationof nitrogen or sulfur oxides in the process of incinerating any of thesecompounds may require additional controls in order to meet air qualityrequirements pursuant to Section 108, 110, and 111 of the Clean Air Actor New Source Review under the CAA's Prevention of Significant Deteriorationprogram. Therefore, EPA requests comment on incinerator design and operation.EPA particularly seeks operating data addressing nitrogen and sulfur oxidegeneration and control in burning wastes containing nitrogen or sulfur,information on combustion units equipped with nitrogen or sulfur oxidecontrols such as selective noncatalytic reduction or selective catalyticreduction, and information concerning the availability of facilities thatcan incinerate these wastes while meeting applicable air quality requirementsfor sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions. (This information also bears onthe issue of availability of sufficient treatment capacity for purposesof RCRA section 3004(h).) EPA also solicits comment on the advisabilityof invoking the omnibus permitting requirements of RCRA (section 3005(c),final sentence) for all sources burning these wastes, or restricting thetreatment of these wastes to combustion units that have appropriate airpollution controls, in order to reduce the adverse human health and environmentaleffects of burning these wastes.

While some of these compounds may not bespecifically identified as ``drugs'' and a few are not specifically generatedby the pharmaceutical industry, EPA's main reasons for grouping these 22waste codes together is the relative similarities in structures withinthis treatability group versus the compounds in the other treatabilitygroups (i.e., all of twenty two of these chemicals are relatively largecomplex heavily substituted molecules). Eighteen of the twenty two compoundshave aromatic rings, nine of which also contain nitrogen or sulfur incorporatedinto the ring. Six of these wastes include aromatic rings that are fusedinto polynuclear aromatic structures. All have multiple double bonds andall include oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atoms. The Agency has data on incineration of Isosafrole that were used in developingthe standards for this treatability subgroup of ``pharmaceutical'' wastes.The new data from EPA's June, 1989 testing of rotary kiln incinerationindicate that Isosafrole can be incinerated to detection limits as measuredin both the ash and scrubber water. Given the size and complexity of thesewaste molecules, EPA believes they can all be incinerated to the limitof detection in ash and scrubber water and is therefore proposing wastewaterand nonwastewater standards based on incineration as BDAT. Four of these wastes, Isosafrole (U141), Methapyrilene (U155), Phenacetin(U187), and Safrole (U203) are amenable to quantification in treatmentresiduals by SW-846 methods. EPA is transferring the incineration performancedata for Isosafrole to all four of these wastes and thus is proposing concentration-basedstandards. Although Strychnine (P108) is also amenable to quantification(by Method 8270 of SW-846), EPA is proposing incineration as a treatmentstandard in order not to stimulate generation of this acutely toxic chemicalfor use as a calibration reagent. The Agency is proposing specified methods of treatment for the seventeenremaining ``pharmaceutical'' wastes which are not amenable to quantificationin waste treatment residual matrices.

Introduction. </T3>This section of today's preamble presentsa discussion of the proposed treatment standards for ignitable (D001),corrosive (D002), and reactive (D003) characteristic wastes. This sectionalso presents proposed treatment standards for certain U and P wastes thateither have the potential to be reactive, particularly in the concentratedform, or are structurally similar to one another. Discussion of the generalissues related to all characteristic wastes and an overview of the majoroptions that the Agency considered in proposing treatment standards forall characteristic wastes are presented in sections III.A.1.g. and III.C.of today's preamble. Ignitable and reactive wastes are already subject to some restrictionson placement in surface impoundments, waste piles, land treatment units,and landfills according to 40 CFR 264.229, 264.256, 264.281, 264.312, 265.229,265.256, 265.281, and 265.312. Additional requirements for disposing labpacks containing ignitable and reactive wastes in landfills are establishedin 40 CFR 264.316. Preamble section III.A.4.f. presents a discussion ofthe impact that today's proposed treatment standards will have on theseprovisions. When today's proposed rule is promulgated, these wastes aresubject to the land disposal restrictions (40 CFR 268) including wasteanalysis, record keeping, and treatment standards. <T3>(1) Treatment of All Characteristic Properties. </T3>The use of a specifiedtreatment method for a particular characteristic waste does not necessarilyensure that the residues from this treatment are no longer a characteristichazardous waste. In other words, treatment for a given characteristic maynot, under today's proposal, completely satisfy the requirements to treatother characteristics in the waste or any new characteristics appearingin the treatment residue. For example, ash residues from the incinerationof an ignitable waste will no longer be ignitable, but may exhibit thecharacteristic of EP toxicity for metals (due to the metals concentratingin the ash) even though the waste may not have been EP toxic prior to incineration;this residue may therefore require further treatment. The Agency expects that residues from treating many corrosive or reactivewastes may exhibit EP toxicity for metals. As discussed in preamble sectionIII.C., the Agency is therefore requiring that no characteristic wastesor their treatment residues may be land disposed unless the treatment standardfor the particular characteristic is above the characteristic level orthe residue has complied with the applicable specified method. Proposedtreatment standards for EP toxic metal wastes (D004-D011) are presentedin section III.A.5. of today's preamble. Because of the nature of some subcategories of these D001, D002, or D003wastes, the Agency is not distinguishing wastewater versus nonwastewaterstandards in all cases. Sometimes this is because there is no way to physicallydistinguish one from the other (e.g. D001 compressed gases are neitherwastewaters nor nonwastewaters), or sometimes it is prudent to apply thesame technology to both wastewaters and nonwastewaters. In other cases,only nonwastewater standards or only wastewater standards are proposedfor subcategories of these characteristic wastes. The Agency solicits commenton the potential for generation of forms of these wastes where no standardsare specified for that particular form or where the commenter believesthat there is a different technology that should be specified. (2) <T3>Treatment Below Characteristic Levels. </T3>The Agency is proposingtwo options for treatment standards for wastes in the D001 Ignitable Liquids,D002 Acid, D002 Alkaline, D002 Other Corrosives, D003 Reactive Cyanide,and D003 Reactive Sulfides treatability groups. As discussed in detailin section III.C. of today's preamble, the Agency has initially determinedthat it has the authority to establish treatment standards below the characteristiclevel for these wastes or at least to make failure to treat to the lowerlevel a violation of section 3004 (m). Therefore, the Agency is proposingsuch standards in particular for wastes in the D001 Ignitable Liquids,D002 Acid, D002 Alkaline, D002 Other Corrosives, D003 Reactive Cyanideand D003 Reactive Sulfides Subcategories. (The specific standards are presentedin the respective discussions of the treatability subcategories below.)The Agency is soliciting comment on the option of treating to reach thecharacteristic level (i.e., removing the characteristic). These particular subcategories of D001, D002, and D003 wastes are definedby specific testing requirements or narrative standards (i.e., reactivecyanides and reactive sulfides). Thus, the Agency is also proposing a secondoption of limiting these treatment standards to the respective characteristiclevels for these D001, D002, or D003 subcategories only (i.e., other subcategoriesof these wastes do not have specific testing requirements or guidance).The Agency specifically solicits comments on these two options. (3) <T3>Deactivation as a Treatment Standard.</T3> The Agency is proposinga general treatment standard of ``Deactivation as a Method of Treatment''for several subcategories of D001, D002, and D003 wastes (i.e., D001 IgnitableReactives, D001 Oxidizers, D002 Other Corrosives, D003 Explosives, D003Water Reactives, and D003 Other Reactives). The Agency has determined thatwithin each of these subcategories there appear to be a further varietyof different waste groups, each with a certain degree of uniqueness withrespect to hazard and handling requirements. Therefore, the Agency believesthat the actual method of ``Deactivation'' chosen for each waste may bespecific to that waste and may be best determined by the generator or thetreater most knowledgeable as to the waste's unique hazards and handlingrequirements.Further, the Agency currently has no information that suggests that oneparticular technology may be generally applicable to all the wastes withineach particular characteristic subcategory, nor that there is one particulartechnology that can be identified as ``Best''.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>This does not preclude the Agency from making such a determinationin the future should additional information and data become available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">However, information does suggest that all of these wastes can betreated by some form of deactivation (e.g., open detonation, thermal destruction,specialized incineration, chemical oxidation, chemical reduction, and controlledreaction with water) and that there apparently are no wastes that requireland disposal without treatment to remove these particular characteristics(i.e., ignitable reactivity, oxidizing potential, explosivity, water reactivity,and other corrosivity or reactivity).The Agency considered proposing a ``No Land Disposal'' standard to thesesubcategories of wastes; however, some commenters to previous land disposalrestriction rules have raised concerns over the effect of these standards.(Note: This concern should be moot, in that, today's notice proposes torevoke all ``No Land Disposal'' standards that were previously promulgated.)There may be similar concerns that the proposed ``Deactivation as a Methodof Treatment'' is also not a treatment standard per se. As a result, theAgency is proposing an alternative of specifying a treatment standard identifiedas ``Thermal Destruction, Specialized Incineration, Chemical Oxidation,Chemical Reduction, and Controlled Reaction with Water as Methods of Treatment''for all wastes in the characteristic subcategories identified as D001 IgnitableReactives, D001 Oxidizers, D002 Other Corrosives, D003 Explosives, D003Water Reactives, and D003 Other Reactives. The Agency is specifically solicitingcomment and data on these technologies (or other technologies) that couldassist the Agency in promulgating these as an alternative standard forthese particular subcategories of characteristic wastes.The Agency believes, however, the proposed standard of ``Deactivation asa Method of Treatment'' provides a needed flexibility in choice of protectivetreatment technology for the anticipated uniqueness of these wastes atspecific sites, while at the same time allowing safe handling proceduresfor the waste because of their overall ``reactive'' nature. The Agencybelieves this is an appropriate approach for these wastes since the hazardouscharacteristic is based on imminent hazard (e.g., violent reactions andignition) rather than on other criteria such as levels of hazardous constituents.The Agency considered another option, that of specifying one technology(e.g., open detonation) for all the wastes that could be included in eachsubcategory and deal with cases where a waste could not be treated by thattechnology through the variance procedures of 40 CFR 268.44. The Agencydoes not prefer this option because of the time and resources that arenecessary to process a large number of petitions for a variance from thetreatment standard.Furthermore, there are no known analytical methods to measure the characteristicsfor which the majority of these wastes are identified, nor a test thatdistinguishes the reactive chemical from the deactivated chemical in thetreatment residues. The Agency solicits comment and data on the proposedoverall approach for setting treatment standards for these subcategoriesof characteristic wastes.<T3>b. Ignitable Characteristic Wastes.</T3> According to 40 CFR 261.21,there are four criteria for identifying a waste as D001 Ignitable. Paraphrasingthese criteria, a waste is a D001 Ignitable if: (1) it is a liquid witha flash point less than 140 anddegrees;F; (2) it is an ignitable compressedgas; (3) it is not a liquid and is capable of causing fire through friction,absorption of moisture, or spontaneous chemical changes and when ignitedburns vigorously and persistently; or (4) it is an oxidizer. EPA has determinedthat these four criteria translate directly into four major D001 Subcategories.If a waste is classified as D001 because it fits under more than one D001subcategory, the waste must be treated by the specified treatment methodthat is the treatment standard for each applicable subcategory.<T3>(1) Ignitable Liquids Subcategory.</T3> The first D001 subcategoryis described as the Ignitable Liquids Subcategory and refers to those D001wastes that exhibit the properties listed in andSection; 261.21(a)(1). Dataindicate that the majority of all D001 wastes generated fall into thissubcategory and are typically described as solvents, paint thinners, contaminatedoils, and various organic hydrocarbons.These wastes are typically classified as nonwastewaters due to their highorganic content (usually greater than 1% TOC). The major organic constituentsin these wastes are volatile flammable hydrocarbons or oxygenated hydrocarbonsthat provide the characteristic of ignitability to the waste (i.e., a flashpoint of less than 140 anddegrees;F). Some of these organics are water solubleand can theoretically be biodegraded in some wastewater treatment systems.Typically these constituents must be diluted to significantly lower concentrationsin the wastewater in order for microorganisms to degrade them. Also, thebiodegradation processes often require an aeration step. During the dilutionand aeration steps, significant amounts of these volatile organic compounds(VOCs) can be emitted to the air. While biodegradation processes may beapplicable for certain D001 Ignitable Liquids, the Agency believes thisprocess is not as protective as thermal destruction technologies.Thermal destruction technologies such as incineration and reuse as a fuelwill completely remove the characteristic of low flash point by completelydestroying the VOCs, thereby rendering the waste nonignitable. Based onthe fact that these techniques remove the characteristic of ignitabilitypermanently and completely, EPA is proposing a treatment standard of ``Incineration,Fuel Substitution, or Recovery as Methods of Treatment'' for D001 in theIgnitable Liquids subcategory. This standard will establish incineration,fuel substitution, or recovery as mandatory processes for handling D001Ignitable Liquids.The Agency has data showing that the majority of D001 Ignitable Liquidsare already treated by incineration, reused as a fuel substitute due totheir high BTU content, or recovered for reuse through processes such asdistillation. The Agency does not want to preclude anyone from using distillationor other recovery techniques for these wastes. At the same time, the Agencydoes not believe that most of these wastes are necessarily recoverableby processes such as distillation. While recovery options may be preferableover incineration or fuel substitution for some of the D001 wastes in thissubcategory, the end result is the same. The choice between incineration,fuel substitution, or recovery may then be made by the generator or treater,based on economics and on the ability of the particular recovery systemto handle the waste. (Additional discussion on fuel substitution as a treatmentmethod for these wastes is contained in the discussion of national capacityvariances in section III.B.)Some D001 Ignitable Liquids have been shown to contain organic constituentsthat are also constituents in F001-F005 solvents. The Agency studied theoption of transferring the standards for these constituents from the correspondingF001-F005 standards promulgated in the November 7, 1986 final rule (51FR 40642). However, the Agency believes that this option would create anunnecessary burden on the regulated community in several ways. The majorityof D001 wastes in the Ignitable Liquids subcategory probably do not containthese constituents. It seems an unreasonable burden to require generatorsof D001 wastes to conduct the significant amount of testing and certificationrequired under the land disposal restrictions, when it is likely that constituentsare not present. Also, the F001-F005 standards are based on analysis ofan extract obtained from use of the TCLP, not on analysis of the totalconcentration in a representative sample of the waste. Therefore, the Agencyprefers to deal with this difference in required testing in a future rulemaking,by establishing treatment standards based on analysis of total constituentconcentrations to replace the F001-F005 standards; the new standards couldthen be transferred to the appropriate wastes in the Ignitable Liquidssubcategory. The Agency has not investigated all the technical issues associatedwith transferring data based on analysis of the TCLP extract to constituentsmeasured by a total waste analysis. Therefore, the Agency is not proposingconcentration-based D001 treatment standards based on a transfer of F001-F005data at this time, although it may reevaluate this decision in the future.The Agency is currently unable to determine whether any D001 wastes inthis subcategory conform to the definition of wastewaters (i.e., containingless than 1% TOC and 1% TSS) as initially generated. The Agency believes,however, if wastewater forms are generated, the treatment standard proposedfor nonwastewaters apply to these wastewaters as well, since the end resultwill be the removal of the ignitability characteristic and destructionof the hazardous constituents.<T3>(2) Ignitable Compressed Gases Subcategory.</T3> The second subcategoryis classified as the Ignitable Compressed Gases subcategory and refersto those D001 wastes that exhibit the properties listed in andSection; 261.21(a)(3)and meet the definitions in 49 CFR 173.300. The Agency has very limitedinformation on the generation and characterization of D001 wastes in thissubcategory, but suspects that while these wastes may be generated, itis unlikely that they require placement in any type of land disposal unit.The Agency believes that there are no gas cylinders containing compressedignitable gases placed in surface impoundments, and that it is physicallyimpossible to dispose them by means of deep well injection. Some cylinderscontaining D001 ignitable gases may be placed in waste piles; however,such placement of a container in a storage unit is not land disposal undersection 3004(k). In addition, these types of cylinders are usually returnedto distribution facilities to be refilled. The Agency does not intend toprevent short-term storage of cylinders prior to refilling.The Agency considered several options for proposing treatment standardsfor compressed ignitable gases. The preferred option is that of recoveryby direct reuse, since typically, the cylinders are directly refilled.A second option is incineration by venting the gas into an incinerator.There may be cases when it is preferable to vent the gas into an appropriateadsorbent material (provided that air emissions can be controlled), andthen incinerate the adsorbed gas/adsorbent material combination to permanentlyremove the characteristic, because this would reduce the risk of explosion.The Agency is not proposing to specify fuel substitution as a method becauseit knows too little about these wastes. EPA will reconsider this questionif additional data adequately characterizing these wastes are submitted.Today, the Agency is proposing a treatment standard of ``Recovery or Incinerationof Vented Ignitable Gases'' for these wastes. This treatment standard willapply to all forms of the Ignitable Compressed Gases, since the definitionsof wastewater and nonwastewater do not apply to this group of wastes (seesection III.A.1.g of today's preamble).<T3>(3) Ignitable Reactives Subcategory. </T3>The third subcategory isclassified as the Ignitable Reactives subcategory and refers to those D001wastes that exhibit the properties listed in andSection; 261.21(a)(2). D001wastes in the Ignitable Reactives subcategory are primarily inorganic solidsor wastes containing reactive materials. These include materials such asreactive alkali metals or metalloids (such as sodium and potassium) andcalcium carbide slags. All of these are very reactive with water and willgenerate gases that can ignite due to heat generated from the reactionwith water. Other ignitable solids in this subcategory include metals suchas magnesium and aluminum that, when finely divided, can vigorously reactwith the oxygen in the air when ignited.There appears to be an overlap between wastes in this D001 subcategoryand certain D003 (characteristic of reactivity) wastes. A close examinationof the definitions in andSection; 261.21(a)(2) for ignitable wastes and andSection;andSection;261.23(a) (2), (3) and (6) for reactive wastes reveals the distinctionbetween these two groups. The key difference is in the definition of ignitablewastes which states: ``* * * when ignited, burns vigorously and persistently.''This phrase implies that the hazard is due primarily to the ignition potentialrather than to the extreme reactivity.D001 Ignitable Reactives are generated on a sporadic basis and generallyin low volumes. They typically are not placed in surface impoundments becausethey often react with water, thus creating a fire hazard. Current managementpractices for some of these wastes, such as calcium carbide slag, involveplacing the wastes in specially designed units for the purpose of controlleddeactivation with water. EPA has determined previously that such deactivationdoes not constitute land disposal. See 51 FR at 40577 (Nov. 7, 1986) and52 FR 21011 (June 4, 1987). Thus, this treatment practice is permissible.Where residues from deactivation in land disposal units (such as wastepiles) leave an EP toxic residue on the land (within the meaning of section3004(k)), a different method of deactivation may be necessary. EPA solicitscomment on this point, including comment regarding implications for availabilityof adequate treatment capacity pursuant to the section 3004(h)(2) determination.Other D001 Ignitable Reactives, such as those containing reactive alkalimetals (sodium or potassium) are sometimes open-detonated. The Agency alsohas data indicating that these wastes are sometimes chemically deactivated.Radioactive zirconium fines that are pyrophoric under 40 CFR 261.21(a)(2)(i.e., that cause fire through friction) have been included in this D001subcategory. The Department of Energy submitted data that appears to indicatethat this waste can be stabilized to remove the reactivity characteristic.Stabilization is not usually considered to be a method of deactivation,and EPA is concerned that this treatment may be a form of impermissibledilution rather than a chemical reaction (i.e., oxidation) that removesthe reactivity characteristic. The Agency solicits comment and additionaldata on whether stabilization is appropriate for radioactive zirconiumfines. Furthermore, the Agency requests comment on whether stabilizationis an appropriate deactivation treatment for all zirconium fine wastes,as well as for the other reactive metals.The Agency is proposing a treatment standard of ``Deactivation as a Methodof Treatment'' for wastes in the D001 Ignitable Reactive subcategory. TheAgency believes this is an appropriate approach for these wastes sincethe hazardous characteristic is based on imminent hazard (i.e., ignitionand violent reaction) rather than on other criteria such as levels of hazardousconstituents, and that technologies exist that can completely remove thischaracteristic. A more complete discussion of the implications of thisstandard is presented in section III.A.4.a.(2.) above, as well as an alternativeproposed standard for wastes in this subcategory.<T3>(4) Oxidizers Subcategory. </T3>The fourth subcategory is classifiedas the Oxidizers subcategory and refers to those D001 wastes that exhibitthe properties listed in andSection; 261.21(a)(4) and meet the definitionsin 49 CFR 173.151. D001 wastes in the Oxidizers subcategory are primarilyinorganic, and include such things as waste peroxides, perchlorates, andpermanganates. The Agency has very limited information on the generationand characterization of D001 wastes in this subcategory. It is possiblethat certain aqueous solutions of these oxidizers may be useful in thetreatment of other hazardous wastes. These wastes must, however, be usedas treatment reagents in tanks and not in surface impoundments due to thepotential release of heat and volatile organics during the oxidation/reductionreactions (see 40 CFR 264.229 and 265.229).The Agency is proposing a treatment standard of ``Deactivation as a Methodof Treatment'' for wastes in the D001 Oxidizers Subcategory. The Agencybelieves this is an appropriate approach for these wastes since the hazardouscharacteristic is based on imminent hazard (i.e., oxidizers can react violentlywith organics or other materials and result in the rapid generation offires) rather than on other criteria such as levels of hazardous constituents,and that technologies exist that can completely remove this characteristic.A more complete discussion of the implications of this standard is presentedin section III.A.4.a.(2.) above, as well as an alternative proposed standardfor wastes in this subcategory.<T3>(5) Need to Treat Rather Than Dilute Ignitable Wastes. </T3>In sectionIII.D. below, EPA discusses the issue of dilution to remove a characteristicand proposes that a prohibited form of dilution that is used to removea characteristic from a prohibited hazardous waste would be a violationof the dilution prohibition in section 268.3. In this section the Agencyaddresses policy concerns that lead to the conclusion that dilution isnot automatically a legitimate mode of treatment of ignitable wastes (andtherefore is not a prohibited form of dilution for purposes of the section268.3 dilution prohibition).On first impression, one might assume that it does not matter how the ignitabilitycharacteristic is removed so long as the waste ends up non-ignitable. Ignitability,however, reflects presence of volatile organic compounds (VOC), which areozone precursors. If ignitable wastes are diluted, VOC will ordinarilybe emitted in concentrations far exceeding those emitted by treatment processesin which these volatiles are destroyed. Control of VOC is a legitimateconcern under RCRA (section 3004 (m)) specifically calls for minimizingthreats to the environment as well as to human health, and the Agency hasspecifically called attention to control of VOC in the 1987 proposed ruleimplementing RCRA section 3004 (n)). Volatile emissions from dilution alsomay pose a reignition hazard. Dilution of ignitable wastes also fails toutilize the wastes' energy value, contravening a fundamental RCRA goalof encouraging recovery of energy from wastes (RCRA section 1002 (d)).EPA also believes that allowing dilution of D001 wastes will create anincentive for generators to miscode the listed, prohibited solvent wastes(F001-F005) as D001 wastes, frustrating the treatment requirements forthose wastes.Accordingly, the Agency believes that dilution should not be a legitimatemethod for treating ignitable wastes. Commenters on this point should addresspolicy reasons for allowing dilution as treatment, or identify circumstanceswhen dilution may occur as a legitimate adjunct to treatment.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> D001<T4> Ignitable Liquids</T4> 261.21(a)(1) <H1>Incineration; Fuel Substitution; or Recovery as Methods of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s25</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> D001<T4> Ignitable Compressed Gases</T4> 261.21(a)(3) <H1>Incineration of Vented* Ignitable Gases; or Recovery as Methods ofTreatment </H1> <ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><F>*Ignitable gases may be vented directly into an incinerator or ventedinto a suitable adsorbent prior to incineration.

Corrosive Characteristic Wastes.</T3> Paraphrasing the criteriafor defining a waste as a D002 Corrosive waste (40 CFR 261.22), a wastecan be a D002 waste if it is aqueous and has a pH less than or equal to2, or greater than or equal to 12.5; or it is a liquid and corrodes steelat a specified rate and temperature. EPA determined that these criteriatranslated into three subcategories for D002 wastes, the Acid Subcategory,the Alkaline Subcategory, and the Other Corrosives Subcategory. <T3>(1) D002 Acid and Alkaline Subcategory.</T3> The Acid Subcategory andthe Alkaline Subcategory, refer to those D002 wastes that exhibit the propertieslisted in 40 CFR 261.22(a)(1) and are distinguishable by the approporiatepH specifications. The Acid subcategory is defined as those wastes witha pH of less than or equal to 2.0, and the Alkaline Subcategory is definedas those with a pH of greater than or equal to 12.5. Also by definition,D002 wastes in these two subcategories only include wastes which are consideredto be ``aqueous'', due to the fact that standard pH measurements can onlybe performed in the presence of significant amounts of water (i.e., pHis the measure of the concentration of hydronium ions in water). D002 wastes in the Acid subcategory typically include concentrated spentacids, acidic wastewaters, and spent acid strippers and cleaners. Wastesin the Alkaline subcategory typically include concentrated spent bases,alkaline wastewaters, and spent alkaline strippers and cleaners. D002 wastesrepresent a significant portion of all hazardous wastes generated by almostevery industry. The Agency believes that many D002 wastes in both the Acid and Alkalinesubcategories are already being treated by chemical neutralization. Thesesubcategories have been defined as hazardous due to their extremes in pH;therefore, any chemical neutralization technology will completely removethe extremes of pH and thereby render the waste noncorrosive. The choiceof neutralizing reagents are dependent upon the subcategory of the waste,i.e., the acid wastes will require bases for neutralization and alkalinewastes will require acids. Based on this, EPA is proposing a treatment standard of ``Base Neutralizationto pH 6-9 and Insoluble Salts'' for the D002 Acidic Subcategory. Likewise,EPA is proposing a treatment standard of ``Acid Neutralization to pH 6- 9 and Insoluble Salts'' for the D002 Alkaline Subcategory. Neutralization with chemicals is not the same as simple dilution to achievea neutral pH. While dilution will change the pH (i.e., the concentrationof the hydronium ions), neutralization with chemicals involves a chemicalreaction. Dilution is merely the addition of significant quantities ofwater in order to arrive at a neutral pH with the anions associated withthe acid (or base) remaining in solution. Neutralization with acids orbases involves a reaction which utilizes a chemical change to achieve neutralpH with the anions either remaining in solution or precipitating as a sludge.The Agency is proposing a range of pH 6 to 9 instead of the characteristicrange of pH 2-12.5 for several reasons. First, hydronium ions from acidssolubilize metals from clay liners, impacting their ability to act as barriersto migration. Moreover, acid wastes between pH 2 and 6 can increase themobility of many hazardous constituents in groundwater relative to wastesin the pH range of 6 to 9. Another reason the Agency is proposing thisrange because this matches the buffering of natural aquatic systems basedon carbonate/bicarbonate pH relationship (i.e., pH 5.5 and 8.5 are carbonate/bicarbonatepH levels indicating what is referred to as the acidity and alkalinity(respectively) of an aqueous environmental sample). The Agency notes, however, that the pH range of 6 to 9 may not be appropriatefor deep well injection into certain formations. A different pH range maybe specified in permits to ensure that injected fluid flows properly throughthe injection zone without plugging. Moreover, deep well injection zonesare not near surface aquatic ecosystems. The Agency does not want to createanomalous results in the context of injected wastes and solicits commentson whether any pH range specified in an underground injection control permitshould supercede the proposed treatment standard range of pH 6 to 9. The Agency prefers neutralization of corrosive wastes over simple dilutionbecause dilution simply creates a larger volume of wastes but does nottreat or remove hazardous constituents in the wastes. Moreover, neutralizationis more conservative of natural resources and more protective of aquaticecosystems. An example of how neutralization conserves natural resources(i.e., water) is shown in the following scenario. Dilution of one gallonof the most frequently used industrial acid, concentrated sulfuric acid,to a pH of just above 2 requires 3,600 gallons of water. Dilution to completelyneutralize the concentrated sulfuric acid to a level that is expected tohave no ecological impact on fresh water systems would require 360,000,000gallons of water. On the other hand, one gallon of this acid can be neutralizedto pH 7 with only 12 pounds of caustic (sodium hydroxide) or only 11 poundsof lime (calcium hydroxide). Treatment to achieve pH 2 actually requiresslightly less caustic or lime; however, the amount is not substantiallyless than the amount required to neutralize to pH 7. The Agency recognizes, however, that dilution in order to facilitate treatmentmay be necessary (i.e., the added water serves as a heat sink that is necessaryto control very exothermic reactions or toxic air emissions). Dilutionin order to facilitate treatment is not prohibited (see sections III.A.1.g.and III.H. for further discussion of dilution of characteristic wastes).When selecting neutralization reagents, it is important to consider thesolubility of the salts produced as a result of neutralization. This isillustrated by the following scenario. Chemical neutralization of one gallonof concentrated sulfuric acid with caustic (sodium hydroxide) results in22 pounds of dissolved salts (in the form of sodium sulfate) that, if improperlymanaged, could adversely impact fresh water ecosystems. However, chemicalneutralization with lime (calcium hydroxide) results in 19 pounds of relativelyinsoluble, nontoxic sludge which would have to be land disposed or otherwiserecovered. (This solid waste could potentially be recycled or reused dependingupon other constituents such as metals that may co-precipitate along withthe solids.) In fact, data from the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) indicatesthat sodium sulfate is the chemical being discharged in largest volumesto surface water. Therefore, the Agency prefers to neutralize D002 wastessuch that relatively nontoxic solid wastes are generated rather than wastewaterdischarges with high dissolved solid contents that could potentially haveadverse impacts on fresh water ecosystems. This is further illustratedby the discharge of soluble nitrate (from either neutralization or dilutionof nitric acid, the second largest acid used in industry) and soluble phosphate(from phosphoric acid). Both of these ions are considered nutrients toaquatic ecosystems and at low levels contribute to the overall growth offresh water ecosystems. However, the discharge of excessive amounts (orslugs of concentrations) of these ions could expedite algal growth andadversely impact the balance of the ecosystems.It is important to point out that when neutralizing some concentrated acidssuch as nitric acid, the point that the acid enters the treatment reactorshould be under the surface of water to avoid possible toxic gas generation(i.e., NOx). Some facilities generate waste streams which fluctuate fromthe Acid subcategory to the Alkaline subcategory depending upon what processis used on a given day. These facilities might be able to utilize thesefluctuations in pH as a means of performing on-site neutralization.<T3>(2) Recoverable Acids. </T3>Recovery options have been demonstratedfor a variety of corrosive wastes. The Agency prefers recovery as a treatmentstandard, in that it results in no discharge of acidic constituents intothe environment and conserves resources. The legislative history of theland disposal restriction provisions also indicates that recovery is thepreferred management alternative. The Agency lacks waste characterizationdata which indicates the wastes that are most amenable to recovery, therefore,the Agency is establishing for this subcategory ``Recovery as a Method''as the treatment standard. The choice between neutralization and recoverymay be made by the generator or the centralized treatment operation, accordingto the applicability and performance of a given type of acid/base recoverysystem.By establishing these treatment standards, the Agency is leaving open theopportunity to the regulated community to apply for a variance from thetreatment standard to account for D002 wastes which cannot be effectivelyneutralized or recovered (40 CFR 268.44). Such a situation could occurfor small quantities of corrosive materials that contain extremely toxicor otherwise hazardous chemicals that may cause an unnecessary risk duringneutralization.The Agency promulgated regulations for liquid hazardous wastes having apH of less than or equal to 2.0 in the California list final rule (52 FR25760, July 8, 1987) by codifying this statutory pH level into 40 CFR 268.32.This regulation, however, is not adequate to address the universe of D002wastes. The California list restrictions apply only to liquid corrosivewastes without specifically identifying them as D002 wastes. Furthermore,the California list final rule did not specify neutralization as a requiredtreatment standard; in fact, the waste may be merely rendered nonliquidprior to land disposal and still satisfy the California list requirements.Therefore, the Agency is today proposing treatment standards for D002 wastesthat will supercede the California list regulations because they are morespecific. (Note the discussion in section III.M., however, regarding continuedapplicability of the California list prohibitions during the periods ofa national capacity variance.)<T3>(3) Other D002 Corrosives. </T3>The third major subcategory is classifiedas the Other Corrosives subcategory and is defined as those D002 wastesthat exhibit corrosivity to steel as defined in andSection; 261.22(a)(2).They often are nonaqueous corrosive wastes such as certain organic liquids,but can represent inorganic chemicals as well.Wastes in the Other D002 Corrosives subcategory are generated on a sporadicbasis and generally in low volumes. The Agency suspects that these wastesare often identified as corrosive without performing the specified testingwith steel (i.e., the corrosivity of the waste may be assumed due the presenceof known corrosive constituents). This may also be due, in part, to thehigh cost of testing and to the difficulties in identifying laboratoriesthat are experienced in steel corrosion testing.The physical and chemical characteristics of this group of wastes varygreatly. The wastes may be aqueous or they may be primarily organic. Inaddition, a large variety of corrosive chemicals may appear as constituentsin this type of corrosive waste. Depending on the concentration of thesecorrosive chemicals, they may corrode SAE 1020 steel. Examples of chemicalsthat may contribute to corrosivity include ferric chloride, benzene sulfonylchloride, benzotrichloride, acetyl chloride, formic acid, hydrofluoricacid, some catalysts, various resins, metal cleaners, and etchants. Highlyconcentrated acids that have no water content may also be included in thissubcategory, since pH measurements are not possible on these wastes.Wastes in the Other Corrosives subcategory are often treated by deactivatingthe corrosive constituents of the waste with an appropriate chemical reagent.Wastes that contain high concentrations of corrosive organics are oftenincinerated, however. Due to the great variety of potential corrosive organics,the Agency does not believe that it should establish concentration-basedstandards based on incineration for these D002 wastes. Removal and recoveryof either organic or inorganic corrosive constituents may also be applicabletechnologies, since recovery could extract the corrosive constituents untilthe waste itself is no longer corrosive to steel.EPA is proposing a treatment standard of ``Deactivation: SAE 1020 SteelCorrosion Rate andless;6.35 mm/yr'' for D002 wastes in the Other Corrosivessubcategory. The Agency believes this is an appropriate approach for thesewastes since the hazardous characteristic is based on imminent hazard (i.e.,the corrosivity to steel may cause rupture of a tank or container, thusreleasing the contents either suddenly or through leaks) rather than onother criteria such as levels of hazardous constituents, and that technologiesexist that can completely remove this characteristic. A more complete discussionof the implications of this standard is presented in section III.A.4.a.(2.)above, as well as an alternative proposed standard for wastes in this subcategory.The Agency is soliciting comments and data on the physical and chemicalcharacterization of all three subcategories of D002 wastes, as well ason the applicability of chemical deactivation and recovery. Facilitieswith D002 wastes that are not amenable to neutralization or deactivationtechniques should submit data on the characteristics of their wastes andtechnically justify why they are not amenable to neutralization or deactivationearly in the comment period for this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for D</T4>002 <T4>Acid Subcategory </T4>261.22(a)(1)<H1>Neutralization with Bases to: 6andless;pHandless;9 and Insoluble Salts;or Recovery as a Method of Treatment</H1> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s100</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for D</T4>002 <T4>Alkaline Subcategory </T4>261.22(a)(1)<H1>Neutralization with Acids to: 6andless;pHandless;9 and Insoluble Salts;or Recovery as a Method of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s100</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for D</T4>002 <T4>Other Corrosives </T4>261.22(a)(2) <H1>Deactivation to: SAE 1020 Steel Corrosion Rate andless;6.35 mm/yr asa Method of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <T3>d. Reactive Characteristic Wastes. </T3>According to 40 CFR 261.23,there are eight criteria for defining a waste as a D003 Reactive waste.Paraphrasing these criteria, a waste can be a D003 waste if: (1) It isunstable and readily undergoes violent changes without detonating; or (2)it reacts violently with water; or (3) it forms potentially explosive mixtureswith water; or (4) when mixed with water, it generates toxic gases; or(5) it is a cyanide or sulfide bearing waste which under certain conditionscan generate toxic gases; or (6) it is capable of detonation or explosivereaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or if heatedunder confinement; or (7) it is readily capable of detonation or explosivedecomposition or reaction at standard temperature and pressure; or (8)it is a forbidden explosive, a Class A explosive, or a Class B explosive.EPA determined that these eight criteria translated into five subcategoriesfor D003 wastes. The first subcategory is classified as the Reactive Cyanidessubcategory and refers to those D003 wastes that exhibit the propertieslisted in andSection; 261.23(a)(5) for cyanide. The second subcategory isclassified as the Explosives subcategory and refers to those D003 wastesthat exhibit the properties listed in andSection;andSection; 261.23(a)(6) through261.23(a)(8). The third subcategory is classified as the Water Reactivesubcategory and refers to those D003 wastes that exhibit the propertieslisted in andSection;andSection; 261.23(a)(2) through 261.23(a)(4). The fourthsubcategory is classified as the Reactive Sulfides subcategory and refersto those D003 wastes that exhibit the properties listed in andSection; 261.23(a)(5)for sulfide. The fifth subcategory is classified as the Other Reactivessubcategory and refers to those D003 wastes that exhibit the propertieslisted in andSection; 261.23(a)(1).All of the known treatment processes for the five D003 subcategories canresult in significant amounts of solid residues. These residues may ormay not exhibit the characteristic of EP toxicity for metals. As discussedin preamble section III.C., no residue which is a characteristic wastemay be land disposed unless the treatment standard is a level above thecharacteristic level or the residue has otherwise complied with the applicablespecified methods.For all subcategories of D003 wastes except the Reactive Cyanides, theAgency believes that development of concentration-based treatment standardswould be difficult because there are no known analytical tests that arespecifically designed to measure the particular reactivity associated witheach D003 treatability subcategory, nor is there a test that distinguishesthe reactive chemical from the deactivated chemical (e.g., sodium is alwaysmeasured as ``total'').The Agency is soliciting comments and data on the physical and chemicalcharacterization of all five subcategories of D003 wastes. The Agency alsorequests comment on the applicability of chemical deactivation, incineration,open detonation, and any other type of chemical or physical deactivationtechnology to these wastes. Facilities with D003 wastes that are not amenableto treatment using these technologies should submit data on the characteristicsof their wastes and technically justify why they are not amenable to theproposed treatment methods early in the comment period for this proposal.<T3>(1) Reactive Cyanides.</T3> D003 wastes in the Reactive Cyanides subcategoryare by definition those cyanide-bearing wastes that generate toxic gases(assumed to be hydrogen cyanide) when exposed to pH conditions between2 and 12.5, in a sufficient quantity to present a danger to human healthand the environment. The Reactive Cyanide wastes typically are generatedby the electroplating and metal finishing industries, and include mixedcyanide salts, cyanide solutions, and cyanide-bearing sludges. Most ofthe volume of all D003 wastes that are generated can be identified as theReactive Cyanides subcategory. Reactive cyanide wastes are not typicallyplaced directly in most types of land disposal units without treatment;however, it is possible that some are placed in surface impoundments.Reactive Cyanide wastes are already subject to special requirements priorto disposal in landfills, surface impoundments, and waste piles under existingregulations. Also, as of July 8, 1987 (the statutory deadline for the Californialist prohibitions), liquid hazardous wastes having a free cyanide concentrationin excess of 1,000 mg/kg (ppm) were prohibited from land disposal. Theseexisting regulations and prohibitions are insufficient, however, to applyto the Reactive Cyanides subcategory. The statute did not specificallyidentify the California list cyanides as D003 wastes, and furthermore,it did not specify a required method of treatment, nor did it establishthe 1,000 mg/kg prohibition level as a ``treatment standard''.The Agency is proposing to transfer concentration-based treatment standardsfor total and amenable cyanides from treatment standards developed in theSecond Third final rule (54 FR 26594, June 23, 1989) for P030 nonwastewaters,to the Reactive Cyanides subcategory. The Agency believes that D003 wastesresemble P030 rather than the cyanide-containing F006-F009 wastes becauseD003 wastes are described as ``reactive'' cyanides and P030 is listed as``soluble'' cyanides. Soluble cyanides are most likely to be reactive becausethey are dissolved. Reactive Cyanides are thus expected to be easily treatedby treatment technologies such as alkaline chlorination and wet air oxidationto meet today's proposed treatment standard for total cyanide of 110 mg/kgand amenable cyanide of 9.1 mg/kg. (Note: The treatment standards for P030were developed based on a transfer from data on the treatment of an F011waste containing low levels of iron and high levels of simple, solublecyanides (i.e., low levels of complexed cyanides). However, the principleof relating P030 wastes, i.e., ``soluble'' cyanides, to D003 ``reactive''cyanides remains essentially the same.)The Agency is also proposing that if data are submitted in public commentsthat clearly indicate that D003 wastes in the Reactive Cyanides subcategorymore closely resemble F006 wastes containing high concentrations of ironor other complexed cyanide, the Agency will promulgate the higher F006treatment standards for cyanides that were established in the Second Thirdrule which reflect the presence of iron cyanide complexes. The Agency believesthat F006 wastes containing high concentrations of iron represent wastesthat are more difficult to treat than those containing only reactive cyanides(or those containing low concentrations of iron). Thus, if D003 ReactiveCyanides are shown to be more similar to F006, they will be subject toa total cyanide level of 590 mg/kg and an amenable cyanide level of 30mg/kg.The Agency will not promulgate the higher (i.e., F006) treatment standardsfor D003 Reactive Cyanides unless the data clearly indicate that the wastesare not merely mislabeled F006, F007, F008, F009, F010, F011, F012, F019or P cyanide wastes. The Agency suspects that some generators are currentlymisclassifying these wastes as D003. The Agency believes that this is primarilyan issue for enforcement. However, by promulgating the lower treatmentstandards (transferred from P030) for D003 Reactive Cyanides, proper identificationof the F and P cyanide wastes will be encouraged. Of greater importanceis the fact that the Agency believes that <T3>soluble </T3>cyanide wastes (e.g., P030) and wastes containing lowiron (e.g., some F011) are more likely to be similar to D003 <T3>Reactive </T3>Cyanides, so that the lower cyanide standards are achievableand therefore would apply. (See also section III.A.6.(a) of today's preamblefor a further discussion of proposed cyanide treatment standards for otherwastes and a proposed clarification of the analytical methodology for compliancewith the promulgated standards.)<T3>(2) Reactive Sulfides Subcategory. </T3>D003 wastes in the ReactiveSulfides subcategory are by definition those sulfide-bearing wastes thatgenerate toxic gases (assumed to be H<T2>2</T2>S) when exposed to a pH between 2 and 12.5, in a sufficient quantityto present a danger to human health and the environment. The Agency isin the process of developing a quantitative threshold for toxic gas generatedfrom reactive sulfide wastes. The interim value the Agency is consideringis 500 mg of H<T2>2</T2>S generated per kilogram of waste. Although this number is onlyan interim guideline, for the purpose of BDAT determinations the Agencyis proposing to use this number to identify the wastes in this subcategory(given the need for an objective means of determining the subcategory'sapplicability.Reactive sulfides may be treated and chemically converted to relativelyinert sulfur, to insoluble metallic sulfide salts, or to soluble sulfatesthat can be removed or recovered. Some data indicate that these wastescan be treated by alkaline chlorination, specialty incineration, or otherchemical deactivation techniques. The Agency believes that some of thesewastes may also be contaminated with organic sulfides known as mercaptans.These malodorous chemicals are believed to complicate the treatment ofthese reactive sulfide wastes. It is believed that these wastes have posedparticular treatment problems for the petroleum refining industry and thepaper and pulp industry.The Agency is proposing a treatment standard of ``Alkaline Chlorination,Chemical Oxidation, or Incineration Followed by Precipitation to InsolubleSulfates'' for the Reactive Sulfide subcategory. (Note: While alkalinechlorination is a form of chemical oxidation, the Agency did not want tospecifically preclude the use of any particular oxidant.) The treatmentstandard is expressed as a required method of treatment rather than asa concentration-based standard because the Agency has not approved a standardanalytical method for testing either sulfides or ``reactive'' sulfidesin hazardous wastes or in treatment residues (however, as noted above,the Agency is working to develop a quantitative threshold for reactivesulfides). The Agency solicits waste characterization and treatment datathat could potentially be used to develop concentration-based treatmentstandards for these wastes.<T3>(3) Explosives subcategory.</T3> D003 wastes in the Explosives subcategoryare by definition those wastes that are capable of detonation or explosivereaction under various conditions, or are forbidden, Class A, or ClassB explosives (according to 49 CFR 173.52, 173.53, and 173.88 respectively).These wastes have typically been identified as being generated by the explosivesindustry and by the U.S. Department of Defense. While these wastes arenot generated as frequently as the Reactive Cyanides, they are generatedmore often than all other Reactive subcategories. Explosives are alreadysubject to special requirements prior to disposal in landfills, surfaceimpoundments, and waste piles under existing regulations. These explosivewastes are not typically placed in most types of land disposal units; rather,they are treated by either open burning, open detonation, or incinerationin specially designed units. Such treatment is expected to permanentlyremove the explosive characteristic of this D003 waste.Incineration also appears to be an applicable technology, so long as theincineration units must be specially designed and fitted with explosion-proofequipment. Such units are not typically found at commercial incinerationfacilities. The Agency is aware that these types of units are currentlyused by the Department of Defense to treat explosive wastes, and thereappears to be a decrease in reliance on open detonation. Due to the largenumber of explosive formulations and the difference in applicable treatments(see Department of the Army Technical Manual TM9-1300-214, Military Explosives)the Agency is proposing a general standard of ``Deactivation as a Methodof Treatment'' for the D003 Explosives subcategory. By establishing thisstandard, the Agency is allowing the regulated community to use that treatmenttechnology (e.g., incineration, chemical deactivation) that best fits thetype of explosive waste. The Agency believes this is an appropriate approachfor these wastes since the hazardous characteristic is based on imminenthazard (i.e., explosivity) rather than on other criteria such as levelsof hazardous constituents, and that technologies exist that can completelyremove this characteristic. A more complete discussion of the implicationsof this standard is presented in section III.A.4.a.(2.) above, as wellas an alternative proposed standard for wastes in this subcategory. (Seealso the Background Document for Characteristic Wastes for more informationon explosive waste characterization.)<T3>(4) Water Reactive and Other Reactives Subcategories.</T3> D003 wastesin the Water Reactive or Other Reactives subcategories can be either organicor inorganic. Water Reactive D003 wastes are either very reactive withwater, or can generate toxic or explosive gases with water. These reactionsare usually very vigorous and therefore difficult to control. Wastes inboth of these subcategories are generated on a sporadic basis and generallyin low volumes. These wastes are not typically placed in land disposalunits nor are they placed in surface impoundments due to their violentreactivity.The Agency has information that suggest that some water reactives are beingopen detonation. It is theorized that the reactive organic constituentsare destroyed by the explosion, and the reactive inorganic constituentsform less hazardous oxides or react with other chemicals in the explosion(such as moisture from the air).In today's notice, the Agency is proposing a general standard of ``Deactivationas the Method of Treatment'' for the D003 Water Reactives and Other Reactivessubcategories. The Agency believes this is an appropriate approach forthese wastes since the hazardous characteristic is based on imminent hazard(i.e., potential violent reactions with water) rather than on other criteriasuch as levels of hazardous constituents, and that technologies exist thatcan completely remove these reactive characteristics. A more complete discussionof the implications of this standard is presented in section III.A.4.a.(2.)above, as well as an alternative proposed standard for wastes in thesesubcategories.<T3>(5) Treatment of Reactive Wastes Does Not Automatically Include Dilution.</T3>As discussed with respect to ignitable wastes, EPA is proposing to classifydilution that removes a prohibited waste's characteristic as impermissiblein certain circumstances (see section III.D. below). This part of the preambleaddresses why dilution of reactive wastes should not automatically be consideredto be a legitimate form of treatment.For reactive wastes that contain cyanide or sulfides, the dilution prohibitionshould clearly apply for the same reason that it applies to any toxic waste.Indeed, the legislative history to the treatment standard provision statesspecifically that cyanides should be destroyed. 130 Cong. Rec. S 9178-79(July 25, 1984) (statement of Sen. Chafee). With respect to other reactivewastes, most cannot be diluted without violent reaction so that dilutionis not a viable management alternative in any event. It thus is the Agency'sview that dilution is not automatically a permissible means of treatingreactive hazardous wastes.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for D</T4>003 <T4>Reactive Cyanides </T4>261.23(a)(5)<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Total) <D>110</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Amenable) <D>9.1</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for D</T4>003 <T4>Reactive Cyanides </T4>261.23(a)(5)<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Total) <D>1.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Amenable) <D>0.10</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s100</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> D003 <T4>Reactive Sulfides </T4>261.23(a)(5) <H1>Alkaline chlorination, chemical oxidation, or incineration followedby precipitation to insoluble sulfates as methods of treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s100</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> D003 <T4>Explosives, Water Reactives, and other Reactives </T4>261.23(a)(6),261.23(a)(2) <T4>Through </T4>(4), <T4>and </T4>261.23(a)(1) <T4>Respectively</T4><H1>Deactivation as a method of treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><T3>e. Effect of Treatment Standards on Disposal Provisions in 40 CFR 264and 265 for Ignitable and Reactive Wastes. </T3>Management practices havebeen established for ignitable and reactive wastes in surface impoundments,waste piles, land treatment units, and landfills (see 40 CFR 264.229, 264.256,264.281, and 264.312, as well as 265.229, 265.256, 265.281, and 265.312).When finalized, the treatment standards proposed today for ignitable (D001)and reactive (D003) wastes will supersede the above-mentioned provisionsand exclusions for permissible land disposal of these waste outlined inPart 264 and 265; therefore, the Agency is proposing to amend these sectionsto reflect the new regulations in Part 268. Facilities handling ignitableand reactive wastes will have to comply with the promulgated treatmentstandards for these wastes in order to land dispose them.f. <T3>U and P Wastes That are Potentially Reactive. </T3>These wastes weregrouped together because they are either highly reactive or explosive,or they are polymers that tend to be highly reactive. These wastes posea significant risk during handling due to their reactivity; this is reflectedin the fact that there are no standard SW-846 methods for analyzing reactivity.Because of the difficulties in handling and analyzing these wastes, theAgency is proposing treatment standards expressed as required methods oftreatment (thus eliminating the need to analyze treatment residues).The Agency investigated several options for developing treatment standardsfor these wastes, including incineration, open burning, open detonation,and chemical deactivation. Most of these wastes are currently managed byincineration. Other wastes included in this group can be recovered or recycled.For the purpose of BDAT determinations, the Agency has identified foursubcategories according to similarities in treatment, chemical composition,and structure. These groups are: (1) Incinerable Reactive Organics andHydrazine Derivatives; (2) Incinerable Inorganics; (3) Fluorine Compounds;and, (4) Recoverable Metallics. The discussion of the treatment standardsapplicable to each subcategory are as follows.<T3>(1) Incinerable Reactive Organics and Hydrazine Derivatives.</T3><ITAG tagnum="25">P009_Ammonium picrate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">P081_Nitroglycerin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">P112_Tetranitromethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U023_Benzotrichloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U096_a,a-Dimethyl benzyl hydroperoxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U103_Dimethyl sulfate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U160_Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">P068_Methyl hydrazine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U086_N,N-Diethylhydrazine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U098_1,1-Dimethylhydrazine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U099_1,2-Dimethylhydrazine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U109_1,2-Diphenylhydrazine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">U133_Hydrazine</ITAG>Incineration represents BDAT for the wastes in this treatability group.Data indicate that these wastes are currently incinerated by commercial,as well as military facilities. The Agency does not believe, however, thatconcentration-based treatment standards based on incineration can be establishedfor these wastes at this time. The major problems in establishing concentration-basedstandards for these wastes are: (1) EPA does not currently have an analyticalmethod for measuring many of these wastes in treatment residues; and (2)where the Agency does have methods, there are no data available on thetreatment of these chemicals. In cases when there is no verified analyticalmethod for a particular waste, EPA tries to find an appropriate measurablesurrogate or indicator compound; however, no constituent has been identifiedin these wastes that could be used as a surrogate or indicator compound.(See section III.A.1.h.(2) for a detailed discussion of analytical problems.)One of the specific problems encountered in analysis of P068, P112, U023,U098, U099, and U103 is that these wastes break down quickly in water (hydrolyze)and that the analysis of wastewater forms of these wastes is very difficultas well as often hazardous due to the intensity of the reaction. See furtherdiscussion on the impact of instability in water on the development oftreatment standards in section III.A.1.h.(2.)(c.) of today's notice. Inaddition, the Agency lacks data on what effects the hydrolysis productswould have on the environment. Besides, verified analytical methods donot currently exist for the quantification of these hydrolysis productsin treatment residues.Another analytical problem is created because P081 wastes are only quantifiableby HPLC methods (Note: EPA rejects HPLC methods for waste treatment residualmatrices for reasons discussed in section III.A.2.h.(2.)(a.).) In addition,there are no verified SW-846 analytical methods for measuring P009 andU133 in treatment residues.These analytical problems preclude setting concentration-based treatmentstandards. The Agency is thus proposing ``Thermal Destruction'' (e.g.,incineration) as a required method of treatment for the nonwastewater formsof these U and P wastes. Although there is an SW-846 method for U109, theAgency is not proposing a numerical standard for this waste since it isvery similar to P068, U086, U098, U099, and U133 (all are hydrazine compounds)and it is the Agency's belief that thermal destruction will be effectivetreatment for this waste.The Agency is proposing ``Carbon Adsorption'' as a required method of treatmentfor the wastewater forms of this group of U and P wastes. Wastewater formsof these wastes can easily be adsorbed due to the branched and ionic natureof their structures. After adsorption (and before disposal) the contaminatedcarbon must be incinerated (in compliance with the proposed treatment standardfor nonwastewaters).Data indicate that some of these wastes (i.e., P068) can be treated byozone/ultraviolet light oxidation. For complete removal and destructionof these wastes from wastewaters, however, ozone/ultraviolet light oxidationmust be followed by carbon adsorption in order to meet the treatment standardwhen it is promulgated.The Agency is unaware of any alternative treatment or recycling technologiesthat have been examined specifically for these U and P wastes and is, therefore,soliciting data and comments on such technologies. In any case, today'sproposed treatment standard does not preclude recycling (provided the recyclingdoes not involve burning as fuel or is not a use constituting disposal;see andSection; 261.33, first sentence).<T3>(2) Incinerable Inorganics.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">P006_Aluminum phosphide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P096_Phosphine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P105_Sodium azide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P122_Zinc phosphide (andgreater;10%)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U135_Hydrogen sulfide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U189_Phosphorus sulfide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U249_Zinc phosphide (andless;10%)</ITAG>These wastes were grouped together because they consist of compounds containingonly inorganics such as sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorous, and metals.

The Agency does not believe, however, that numerical treatmentstandards based on incineration can be established for these wastes atthis time. The major problem in establishing concentration-based standardsfor these wastes is that EPA does not currently have an analytical methodfor measuring these wastes in treatment residues. In cases when there isno analytical method for a particular waste, EPA tries to find an appropriatemeasurable surrogate or indicator compound; however, no constituent hasbeen identified in these wastes that could be used as a surrogate or indicatorcompound for nonwastewaters. See section III.A.1.h.(2.) for a detaileddiscussion of analytical problems.One of the specific problems encountered in analysis of P006 and P105 isthat these wastes break down quickly in water (hydrolyze), making the analysisof wastewater forms of these wastes very difficult. In addition, SW-846analytical methods do not exist for P105 and U189. In today's rule theAgency is proposing a treatment standard of ``Thermal Destruction'' forthe nonwastewater forms of these wastes. While these wastes are inorganic,thermal destruction will convert these reactive and acutely toxic materialsto less toxic, nonreactive inorganic oxides. However, these wastes willprobably contain high concentrations of sulfur and phosphorous when discardedas off-spec products, making their treatment more difficult. Incinerationof these wastes will require the use of air pollution control equipmentcapable of controlling the emissions of phosphorous and sulfur to acceptablelevels (see the discussion of this issue as it relates to organo-nitrogensand organo-sulfur U and P wastes in section III.A.3.g.).For wastewater forms of P006, P096, P122, U135, U189, and U249, the Agencyis proposing a standard of ``Chemical Oxidation Followed by Precipitationas Insoluble Salts''. For the wastewater forms of P105, the Agency is proposing``Chemical Oxidation'' as a method of treatment because the sodium azideforms sodium ions in solution rather than forming salts.The Agency is currently unaware of any alternative treatment or recyclingtechnologies that have been examined specifically for these wastes andsolicits data and comments on these. The proposed rule, in any case, doesnot preclude recycling (provided the recycling does not involve burningas fuel or is not a use constituting disposal; see andSection; 261.33, firstsentence).<T3>(3) Fluorine Compounds.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">P056_Fluorine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U134_Hydrofluoric Acid</ITAG>These wastes were grouped together because of their physical form and becausethey contain fluorine. Both of these chemicals may be generated as gases(although U134 is often generated as an aqueous acid). Both of these chemicalsare also highly reactive and highly corrosive.The Agency is proposing a treatment standard of ``Solubilization in WaterFollowed by Precipitation as Calcium Fluoride'' as a method for the nonwastewaterform of these wastes, based on the chemical properties of aqueous fluorideions and the insolubility of calcium fluoride. The Agency is also proposingthat recovery as an alternative specified method. The Agency is requestingcomments and data on these options.The Agency has recently collected data for the wastewater forms of thesewastes (see BDAT Background Document for Wastewaters Containing BDAT ListConstituents in the RCRA Docket). Based on these data, the Agency is proposinga concentration-based treatment standard of 35 mg/l.<T3>(4) Recoverable Metallics.</T3><ITAG tagnum="15">P015_Beryllium dust</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P073_Nickel carbonyl</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">P087_Osmium tetroxide</ITAG>The Agency has identified the wastes in this group as metal wastes thathave a high potential for recovery.

Information availableto the Agency indicates that recovery of these metallic elements from thesewaste is feasible and is currently practiced. The Agency is proposing astandard of ``Recovery as a Method of Treatment'' for both nonwastewaterand wastewater forms of these wastes. At this time the Agency is not awareof any treatment alternative applicable to these wastes and is solicitingcomments and information that may help to identify alternative treatment.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>P009, P068, P081, P112, U023, U086,U096, U098, U099, U103, U109, U133, <T4>and</T4> U160<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Thermal Destruction as a Method of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s100</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>P009, P068, P081, P112, U023, U086,U096, U098, U099, U103, U109, U133, <T4>and</T4> U160<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Incineration or Carbon Adsorption as Methods of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s100</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4> P006, P096, P105, P122, U135, U189,<T4>and</T4> U249<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Chemical Oxidation Followed by Precipitation as Insoluble Salts asa Method of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s100</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>P006, P096, P105, P122, U135, U189,<T4>and</T4> U249<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Thermal Destruction as a Method of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s100</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>P015, P073, <T4>and</T4> P087<H1>Recovery as a Method of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s100</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>  P056 <T4>and</T4> U134<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Solubilization in Water Followed by Precipitation as Calcium Fuoride;or Recovery as Methods of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,10</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>P056<T4> and </T4>134<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Fluoride<D>35 </D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>5. Proposed Treatment Standards for Metal Wastes_a. Introduction.</T3>Metal wastes are hazardous wastes containing metallic compounds such asmetallic salts, organometallics, and bimetallic compounds. Certain K, U,and P wastes were listed specifically for the presence of metallic compounds.Additionally, a waste can be identified as an EP toxic characteristic wastebased on the concentration of one of eight different metals (see 40 CFR261.24). Paraphrasing the criteria in 40 CFR 261.24, a waste exhibits thecharacteristic of EP toxicity if the extract from the EPA-specified extractionprocedure (EP) contains arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury,selenium, or silver at a concentration equal to or greater than the levelspresented in Table I_Maximum Concentration of Contaminants for Characteristicof EP Toxicity.<T3>(1) General Characterization of Metal Wastes. </T3> There are alsopatterns encountered in characterizing metal compounds that had to be dealtwith in order to propose treatment standards for these wastes. Some wastecharacterization data was gathered by EPA in the National Survey of Treatment,Storage, Disposal, and Recovery Facilities (the TSDR Survey); however,the major source of waste characterization data was the National Surveyof Hazardous Waste Generators (the Generator Survey). The Generator Surveywas statistically designed to represent a cross-section of all major hazardouswaste generators. Results of this survey have been used to develop today'sproposed treatability groups and corresponding treatment standards wheneverpossible. (However, one problem encountered was that the U and P wastesare generated sporadically; thus, characterization data on the U and Pforms of these metal wastes are limited.)Results of the Generator Survey indicate that many metalbearing wastesoften exhibit another characteristic such as reactivity, or contain concentrationsof other metals above their characteristic levels. For example, P065 (mercuryfulminate) exhibits the characteristic of reactivity which must be removedprior to land disposal. Another example is that of P114 (thallium selenite),where proposed treatment standards address both total thallium and totalselenium. If metal wastes exhibit multiple characteristics, treatment mustaddress each characteristic (including the characteristic of EP toxicityfor each metal where a waste is EP toxic for a number of metal constituents),in addition to the primary metal constituent. Generally, this requirementpresents no problem in that most metals are amenable to conventional metalhydroxide or sulfide precipitation and stabilization. There are problems,however, asscciated with arsenic, barium, selenium, and mercury. Thesemetals are discussed separately in subsequent sections due to their uniquechemistries.There are certain analytical difficulties associated with metal compoundsthat EPA had to deal with in order to propose treatment standards for thesewastes. Analytical methods are capable of measuring the concentration ofa specific toxic metal in a waste. There is no way, however, to measurethe concentration of a specific metallic compound (e.g., a metal salt).For example, given a mixture of chromium nitrate and chromium sulfate,analytical methods will measure chromium but will not determine whetherit is in the sulfate or nitrate form. Further complications in identifyingthe specific metallic compound arise because many of these compounds willdissociate in water. Therefore, treatment standards for metallic compoundsare based on a quantitative analysis for the metal constituent only, andnot on the metallic salt. The Agency believes that by regulating the metal,the primary toxic hazard associated with these metallic compounds willbe controlled. For example, the Agency believes that by regulating totalchromium in U032 (calcium chromate), the hazards associated with that wastewill be addressed. The Agency requests comment on whether it is appropriateto regulate only the toxic metal constituents in these wastes.<T3>(2) Development of Treatment Standards for Metals.</T3> Most metalwastes are generated in inorganic matrices such as inorganic solutions,wastewater treatment sludges, or incinerator ash-type residues. These wastesare typically amenable to conventional treatment such as metal hydroxideor sulfide precipitation and stabilization. Metal wastes may be present,however, in complex matrices such as contaminated soil or have significantquantities of organic constituents. Stabilization techniques may not alwaysbe effective treatment for these organometallic wastes; therefore, incinerationis typically required to destroy the organic constituents prior to recoveryor stabilization.In today's notice, the Agency is proposing treatment standards for manyof the D, F, K, U, or P wastes expressed as concentrations of specificmetals. Performance data are available from treatment of various F andK wastes which contain these metals. Characterization data on many of thesemetal wastes are limited, and therefore, the Agency is proposing treatmentstandards for many metal-bearing wastes based on a transfer of performancedata from other wastes containing these metals having similar waste characteristics.The Agency is soliciting comment on these transfers for metal wastes. The Agency is proposing treatment standards for the characteristic metalsexpressed as concentration-based standards or as required methods of treatment.Consistent with the discussion in preamble section III.C., the Agency is,in some cases, proposing concentration-based treatment standards lowerthan the characteristic levels. In other cases, the Agency is specifyinga method of treatment. EPA could possibly develop concentration-based treatmentstandards, however, if commenters submit data supporting such an action.The preamble sections that follow contain summaries of the Agency's initialconclusions. More detailed information is contained in the Background Documentfor each metal. (3) <T3>Relationship to California List Prohibitions</T3>. There is regulatoryoverlap between the statutory levels in effect for California list metalsand the treatment standards for characteristic metal wastes being proposedtoday. The Agency has stated in previous rulemakings (see 52 FR 25773 (July7, 1987); and 53 FR 31187 (August 17, 1989)) that in cases where thereis regulatory overlap, the more waste-specific treatment standard applies.The Agency is today proposing treatment standards for characteristic EPtoxic metal wastes. The proposed concentration-based wastewater and/ornonwastewater treatment standards, when promulgated, will supercede theCalifornia list statutory levels for these metals because they are morespecific. The California list statutory levels will continue to apply tothe land disposal of liquid hazardous wastes containing nickel and thallium(except for those F, K, U, or P listed wastes for which treatment standardsfor nickel and/or thallium are promulgated) because these toxic metalsare currently not covered by the EP toxicity test. (See also section III.M.below dealing with the issue of continued applicability of California listprohibitions including during national capacity variance periods.) <T3>b.

The Agency considersarsenic and selenium to be in the same general treatability group due tosimilarities in their chemical behavior. Although arsenic and seleniumexhibit positive valence states, they show little tendency to exist assolitary cationic species in aqueous matrices. Arsenic and selenium typicallyexist in aqueous conditions as oxo-anions (e.g., arsenic appears primarilyas anionic arsenite (AsO<T2>2</T2>^) or arsenate (AsO<T2>4</T2>^3)). This behavior is important, in that selection and performanceof treatment technologies for other metals are based primarily on the cationicbehavior of the metals in aqueous conditions. Thus, treatment technologiesfor both wastewaters ard nonwastewaters containing arsenic and seleniumare often different compared to wastes containing only other metal constituents.The treatment standards presented in today's preamble for all arsenic andselenium wastes are based on a limited amount of treatment data. In thisnotice the Agency is soliciting data on the characterization and treatmentof wastes containing arsenic or selenium. Copies of any additional datapertaining to these proposed treatment standards that may be submittedduring the public comment period can be specifically requested in writingby identifying the request for data as ``Additional data on treatment ofarsenic and selenium_Section III.A.5.b.''. See section III.A.1.i. of today'spreamble for additional information on procedures for requesting additionaldata on specific standards. <T3>(1) Identification of BDAT for Wastewaters. </T3>When evaluating treatmenttechnologies to establish wastewater treatment standards for arsenic andselenium wastes, the Agency believes that it must consider not only theefficiency of removal of these metals from the wastewater, but also thephysical and chemical state of the arsenic and the selenium that ends upin the wastewater treatment residues. Wastewater treatment for most metalsis typically based on precipitation with anionic species such as hydroxideor sulfide. Soluble arsenic species have been reported to be removed from wastewatersby using lime (calcium hydroxide) as a precipitant, resulting in arsenicprecipitation as a calcium salt (calcium arsenate) rather than as a hydroxideas is typical for most other metals. Sulfide precipitation using sodiumsulfide or hydrogen sulfide as reagents has also been reported as beingpartially effective for wastewaters containing arsenic in the form of arsenates,but relatively ineffective for arsenites. The removal of arsenic throughthe addition of a sulfide is believed to be the result of a chemical reactionof the arsenate anions with the sulfide anions thereby converting the arsenateform to a relatively insoluble arsenic sulfide. While calcium arsenateis slightly soluble in water, arsenic sulfide is practically insolublein water. Although lime may be effective in precipitating arsenic fromwastewaters, sulfide precipitation should result in a precipitate thatis less soluble in water than the calcium salt. To further complicate matters, while arsenic sulfide is relatively insolublein water under acid conditions, information indicates that the leachability(i.e., solubility) of the arsenic sulfide increases under alkaline conditions.Therefore, the decrease in solubility of arsenic sulfide versus the calciumarsenate must be balanced against the potential for leachability of theresulting wastewater treatment sludges during co-disposal with alkalinewastes or materials. This potential for increased leachability under theseconditions is a legitimate concern, in that some operators of hazardouslandfills co-dispose all ``metal'' wastes and it is typical practice toadd excess lime to prevent migration of the other metals prior to disposal.The Agency solicits comment on whether it should specify the use of sulfideas the precipitating reagent for all wastewaters containing arsenic aspart of the treatment standard. In a similar manner, the Agency solicitscomment on whether it should establish disposal requirements under 40 CFRparts 264 and 265 for all arsenic and selenium wastewaters that would requiresulfide precipitation followed by segregation of the treatment residualsfrom alkaline materials (in either monofills or separate subcells withina landfill). Such a requirement would be a type of management standarddesigned to prevent co-disposal of incompatible wastes. By soliciting comment,EPA notes that these proposed requirements may be promulgated as additionalrequirements to meeting the proposed concentration-based standards. Some arsenic and selenium wastewaters, such as those from wood preservingoperations, may require more extensive treatment trains in order to treathexavalent chromium, other metals, and organics which could possibly interferewith the treatment of the arsenic or selenium. A reduction step for hexavalentchromium and an oxidation step (with reagents such as hydrogen peroxideor hypochlorite) may be necessary to treat the organics. In addition, complexedorganometallics which may be present will probably have to be oxidizedor otherwise removed prior to conversion of the metals to their propervalence state for further metal treatment by precipitation. However, theAgency currently lacks data that indicate that the proposed concentration-basedstandards cannot be achieved for these types of wastes and anticipatesthat pretreatment steps such as hexavalent chromium reduction and chemicaloxidation of organics could remove these potential interferences. Thisis further supported by the fact that quantitative analytical methods forarsenic and selenium in waste samples include such pretreatment steps toremove the interferences during analysis. The Agency specifically solicitscomments on the applicability of these and other pretreatment technologiesfor arsenic and selenium wastewaters and data that indicate the achievabilityof the concentration-based standards proposed in the following sections.<T3>(a) Proposed Standards for Arsenic-Containing Wastewaters</T3>. TheAgency has data on precipitation of arsenic from wastewaters identifiedas D004 from the veterinary pharmaceutical industry using lime followedby manganese sulfate and ferric in a three stage alkaline process. TheAgency believes that these data represent a matrix that is very difficultto treat since it consists of a mixture of organic and inorganic compounds,including organo-arsenicals and inorganic arsenic compounds in concentrationsup to 1,600 ppm. The data show that this three stage alkaline precipitationprocess provides effective treatment and removal of arsenic from thesewastewaters because it reduces the concentration of arsenic in the wastewaterto levels below the characteristic level of 5.0 mg/l. Therefore, the Agencyis proposing two options for treatment standards for D004 wastewaters.Based on these treatment data, the Agency is proposing a treatment standardof 0.79 mg/l arsenic for all D004 wastewaters. The Agency believes thatthese wastes represent the most difficult to treat wastewaters. As discussedin detail in section III.C. of today's preamble, the Agency has initiallydetermined that it has the authority to establish treatment standards belowthe characteristic level for these wastes or at least to make failure totreat to the lower level a violation of section 3004(m). The Agency isalso proposing a second option of limiting the treatment standard for D004wastewaters to the characteristic level of 5.0 mg/l. The Agency specificallysolicits comments on these two options.The constituents for which P010, P011, and P012 wastes are listed are allinorganic forms of arsenic. The constituents for which P036, P038, andU136 wastes are listed are all organic forms of arsenic. K031 and K084are typically generated as process wastes that contain mixtures of bothorganic and inorganic forms of arsenic. While all of these wastes are typicallygenerated as nonwastewaters, the Agency expects that wastewater forms ofthese wastes may be generated from incidental spills or from the treatmentprocess itself and thus would require treatment standards. The Agency expectsthat untreated wastewaters will be more dilute than the untreated D004wastewaters that were used to develop the treatment standards, and thuswould be expected to be less difficult to treat. Further, while K031, K084,P036, P038, and U136 wastes all contain organic forms of arsenic, the Agencybelieves that they can be chemically oxidized (using peroxides, permanganates,persulfates, or perchlorates) to destroy the organometallic bond priorto precipitation.The Agency is proposing to transfer the D004 performance data and concentration-basedtreatment standard of 0.79 mg/l for K031, K084, P010, P011, P012, P036,P038, and U136 wastewaters. This is a reasonable approach given that: (1)The D004 wastewater that was tested by the Agency contained organo-arsenicalssimilar in structure to (or more complex than) those contained in K031,K084, P036, P038, and U136; (2) the D004 wastewater also contained inorganicarsenic compounds similar to those contained in K031, K084, P010, P011,and P012; (3) the untreated wastewater forms of these wastes are expectedto be more dilute than the untreated D004 wastewater; and (4) the performancedata demonstrate that the arsenic in the D004 wastewater can effectivelybe removed.Additional wastewater treatment data primarily from the Agency's Officeof Water have been recently analyzed for incorporation into the treatmentstandards for arsenic wastewaters. These data include the treatment ofwastewaters that are not specifically listed as RCRA hazardous wastes,but do contain many of the corresponding U, P, and metal constituents.While these data were not available in time to incorporate into this discussionor into the background document for these wastes, these data are beingplaced in the administrative record for today's notice. Therefore, theAgency is not precluded from using these data in promulgating the standardsfor these wastes. Further information on these data can be found in sectionIII.A.1.h. (6.).An alternative standard for arsenic based on these data are presented insection III.A.7. of today's notice for wastewater forms of multi-sourceleachate. This standard is based on single step chemical precipitationprocess. Thus, the Agency is proposing these standards as alternative standardsfor wastewaters for which concentration-based standards based on incineratorscrubber waters have been proposed in the following sections.<T3>(b) Proposed Standards for Selenium-Containing Wastewaters. </T3>TheAgency has no specific treatment data on RCRA hazardous wastewaters containingselenium. However, based on the similarities in chemical behavior of arsenicand selenium, the Agency is proposing to extrapolate the performance datafor arsenic contained in D004 wastewaters to the selenium contained inD010 wastewaters and is thus proposing two options for treatment standardsfor D010 wastewaters.Based on these treatment data, the Agency is proposing a treatment standardof 0.79 mg/l selenium for all D010 wastewaters. This is based on a levelof treatment achieved for wastewaters that are representing the most difficultto treat. As discussed in detail in section III.C. of today's preamble,the Agency has initially determined that it has the authority to establishtreatment standards below the characteristic level for these wastes orat least to make failure to treat to the lower level a violation of Section3004(m). The Agency is also proposing a second option of limiting the treatmentstandard for D010 wastewaters to the characteristic level of 1.0 mg/l.The Agency solicits comments regarding the transfer of these performancedata to D010 wastewaters and is specifically soliciting additional treatmentdata for wastewaters containing treatable levels of selenium that wouldclassify the wastewaters as D010 prior to treatment.Similar to the preceding discussion and the discussion for U and P arsenicwastewaters, the Agency is also proposing to transfer the D004 performancedata for arsenic to the selenium in P103, P114, U204, and U205 wastewaters.Thus, the treatment standard for these wastewaters is proposed as 0.79mg/l selenium.Additional wastewater treatment data primarily from the Agency's Officeof Water have been recently analyzed for incorporation into the treatmentstandards for selenium wastewaters. These data include the treatment ofwastewaters that are not specifically listed as RCRA hazardous wastes,but do contain many of the corresponding U, P, and metal constituents.While these data were not available in time to incorporate into this discussionor into the background document for these wastes, these data are beingplaced in the administrative record for today's notice. Therefore, theAgency is not precluded from using these data in promulgating the standardsfor these wastes. Further information on these data can be found in sectionIII.A.1.h.(6.).An alternative standard for selenium based on these data are presentedin section III.A.7. of today's notice for wastewater forms of multi-sourceleachate. This standard is also based on single step chemical precipitationprocess. Thus, the Agency is proposing these standards as alternative standardsfor wastewaters for which concentration-based standards based on incineratorscrubber waters have been proposed in the following sections.<T3>(2) Identification of BDAT for Nonwastewaters. </T3>The success ofconventional stabilization processes for hazardous wastes containing metalsis due partly to the ability of the alkaline cementitious reagents to chemicallybind the cationic metal species. The Agency attempted pozzolanic stabilizationof K031 nonwastewaters that contained relatively high concentrations ofarsenic (133,000 ppm). The resultant data indicate that in some cases arsenicleachability from the treated residues was 10% <T3>higher</T3> than that from the untreated wastes. The increase in arsenicleachability after stabilization is probably due to the anionic characterof the arsenic complexes that may be present in the waste, the inapplicabilityof stabilization processes to anionic metal species, and to the probableincrease in solubility of some forms of arsenic at higher pH. This increasein leachability appears to indicate that the arsenic is not being chemicallybound by the conventional stabilization reagents that were chosen for examination.Some data indicate that cementitious or pozzolanic stabilization of wastescontaining low concentrations of arsenic can be performed. These stabilizationdata using cement, lime, and other proprietary binder mixtures are inconclusivein demonstrating stabilization of arsenic. Although the amount of leachablearsenic is sometimes reduced, the results are not reproducible and, insome cases, can be attributed to dilution with the binders (high binderto waste ratios). While the Agency has not fully investigated these potentialproblems in solidification for high concentrations of selenium, the Agencybelieves, based on selenium's chemical similarities to arsenic, that thesesame complications will occur. Some data also indicate that asphalt stabilization of inorganic, low levelarsenic waste can be performed, and may be especially appropriate for stabilizingarsenic in waste matrices containing other metals, because cementitiousstabilization may increase the arsenic leachability. The two major concernsthe Agency has regarding the application of this technology to arsenicand selenium wastes are: (1) the possibility that hazardous organic constituents(such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) that may be present in theasphalt itself will leach; and (2) the lack of performance data on thistechnology for arsenic and selenium wastes. An analysis of a TCLP extractfrom a sample of asphalt binder showed no sign of leaching organics, seeminglyeliminating one of these concerns. Additional information regarding performanceof this technology on arsenic and selenium wastes still remains necessary.The Agency therefore solicits comment and data on this technology. No attempt was made by the Agency to differentiate between low leve1 andhigh level arsenic or selenium wastes in the development of the proposednonwastewater standards. The Agency does not have the data to properlymake a distinction between a high level and a low level subgroup, or todetermine applicable treatment for wastes in each subgroup. However, theAgency recognizes that a high level and a low level treatability groupmay exist and that treatment technologies for wastes in each group maybe different. Therefore, the Agency is requesting data and comments identifyingapplicable treatment technologies for these potential subgroups. If nodata is received, the standards proposed in today's rule will apply toall forms of nonwastewaters containing arsenic and selenium, regardlessof the concentration of these metals in the waste. As an alternative to cementitious stabilization for arsenic and seleniumwastes, the Agency has identified vitrification as a stabilization technologythat is applicable to nonwastewaters. Vitrification is a technology thatuses high temperatures (1200 anddegrees;C to 1500 anddegrees;C) generated byelectrodes or direct flame to melt a mixture of glass formers and wastematerials into a molten slag which then cools and incorporates the metalsand other materials into this glass/slag matrix. The waste materials areusually added after the glass is liquefied. This technology can be appliedto wastes containing organic as well as inorganic forms of arsenic sinceit operates at temperatures that will destroy the organics present in thewastes. When the glass/slag matrix cools and solidifies, it forms a relativelyimpermeable mass. (See the Arsenic/Selenium Background Document for additionaldiscussion of this technology). Vitrification uses high operating temperatures that may cause the arsenicand selenium in the waste to volatilize. The glass melting furnaces, however,are designed so that any volatiles will condense in the cooler areas atthe top of the furnace that falls back down into the molten glass, thusbeing further treated. Additional information indicates that precalcinationof materials containing arsenate (ferric or calcium) at temperatures closeto 400 anddegrees;C has been found to reduce potential losses of arsenicdue to vaporization during vitrification. After these arsenate materialshave been calcined as a pretreatment step, they were dissolved in an ironsilicate slag at temperatures up to 1290 anddegrees;C without volatilizationof arsenic oxides. Therefore, this appears to demonstrate that for certainarsenic wastes volatilization resulting from the vitrification treatmentprocess should not be an air pollution problem. Vitrification has beenused successfully by the nuclear industry for the disposal of low levelradioactive waste containing metallic elements. The Agency is solicitingcomments and data on this stabilization technique for arsenic and seleniumwastes. Of particular interest is data for those wastes that are knownto contain organo-complexes of these metals. Arsenic and selenium are produced as a by-product of copper and gold miningoperations. The Agency believes that for some wastes, recovery of arsenicand selenium is feasible using high temperature metal recovery technologiesused by mining operations, provided the metal has been first chemicallyconverted to an easily recoverable form. Information available to the Agencyindicates that recovery of elemental selenium out of certain types of scrapmaterial and other type of wastes is currently practiced in the UnitedStates. The Agency is requesting comments and data on the applicabilityof these, and any other, recovery technologies for wastes containing arsenicor selenium. While recovery options may be preferable over vitrificationor stabilization for some of these wastes, the choice of treatment optionsmust be made by the generator or treater based on the ability of the particularrecovery system to handle the waste. <T3>(a) Proposed Standards for Arsenic-Containing Nonwastewaters. </T3>Dataavailable to the Agency indicate that vitrification can incorporate arsenicin concentrations up to 23.5% into a glass/slag matrix with a maximum leachabilityof arsenic at 1.8 mg/l (using the EP toxicity protocol). In all, thesedata consist of 14 separate data points, with arsenic concentration inthe untreated wastes ranging from 0.3% to 23.5% and leachate concentrationsranging from 0.007 mg/l to 1.8 mg/l. The Agency is specifying that theEP toxicity test be performed to measure compliance with today's proposednonwastewater standards. The EP should be used rather than the TCLP becauseall of the performance data from vitrification upon which EPA is relyingused the EP to evaluate the technology's performance. However, a facilityis not precluded from demonstrating the statistical equivalency of theTCLP to EP test for these wastes. The Agency views the continued use ofthe EP test as a measure of compliance with treatment standards as unfortunate.We strongly encourage the submission of TCLP performance data for arsenicthat will eliminate the need for a separate analytical protocol for thismetal. In addition, as noted in other rulemakings, EPA views the TCLP asthe most appropriate protocol for measuring the effectiveness of stabilizationas BDAT). All of these data indicate that the vitrification can achieve stabilizationof arsenic to leachate levels below the characteristic level (5.0 mg/l).However, using the analytical recovery data transferred from the Agency'sanalysis of K102 incinerator ash (which had the appearance of a slag) anda variability factor of 2.8, a concentration-based treatment standard forarsenic of 5.6 mg/l in the leachate (measured by the EP toxicity test)was calculated. The Agency is also proposing to transfer the concentration-based treatmentstandard of 5.6 mg/l arsenic to K031, K084, P010, P011, P012, P036, P038,and U136 nonwastewaters. We believe that the performance of the vitrificationtechnology, and analytic variability of treatment residues, also will notchange for different arsenic-containing wastes. Thus, we think this transferis legitimate. <T3>(b) Proposed Standards for Selenium-Containing Nonwastewaters.</T3>The Agency has no treatment data on D010 nonwastewaters. However, basedon the similarities in chemical behavior of arsenic and selenium, the Agencyis extrapolating the performance data for vitrification of arsenic to D010nonwastewaters and thus is proposing the same concentration-based standard,5.6 mg/l selenium as measured in the leachate generated by the EP toxicitytest. In a similar manner, the Agency is proposing to transfer this concentration-basedtreatment standard of 5.6 mg/l selenium to P103, P114, U204, and U205 nonwastewaters.The Agency solicits comment on the transfer of these performance data toD010 nonwastewaters, and requests data on any treatment or recovery technologiesapplicable to these nonwastewaters. Because this treatment standard (5.6 mg/l) is above the level of leachableselenium that defines the waste as D010 (1.0 mg/l), D010 wastes that aregenerated at a level between 5.6 mg/l and 1.0 mg/l are considered to meetthe treatment standard, but are still considered hazardous wastes and,therefore, must be land disposed in a subtitle C facility. <T3>(3) Revisions to KI01 and K102 Treatment Standards. </T3>In the FirstThird final rule (53 FR 31170, August 17, 1989) , the Agency establishedtwo subcategories of K101 and K102 nonwastewaters based on the concentrationof arsenic in the waste. A low arsenic subcategory was established forwaste containing less than 1% arsenic and a high arsenic subcategory forwaste containing 1% or greater. EPA believed this distinction establishinga subcategory for high arsenic K101 and K102 nonwastewaters was necessaryto ensure that facilities did not burn arsenic-containing wastes that couldpotentially create a significant risk due to stack emissions of arsenic.Treatment standards for the organics contained in these wastes were developedbased on incineration of K101 and K102 nonwastewaters in the low arsenicsubcategory. The corresponding nonwastewater standards included the regulationof certain metals based on stabilization. However, EPA did not establisha nonwastewater treatment standard for arsenic because the data did notindicate treatment for the arsenic. In today's notice the Agency is proposing to change the nonwastewater standardsfor K101 and K102 promulgated in the First Third final rule by eliminatingthe low and high level arsenic subcategories and by replacing the existingstandards with a concentration-based treatment standard for arsenic of5.6 mg/l (measured in the EP extract) based on the performance of vitrification.The Agency believes that the organic constituents present in these wastes(for which treatment standards were based upon incineration) will be destroyedby the high temperatures at which vitrification operates (temperaturescomparable to incineration). Therefore, the Agency is proposing to removethe organic standards for K101 and K102 nonwastewaters. In addition, EPAis proposing to eliminate the existing metal standards for nonwastewatersbecause they were based on performance of a different stabilization technology.The Agency is also proposing new wastewater treatment standards for K101and K102 in today's rule. Standards for K101 and K102 wastewaters werepromulgated in the First Third rule (53 FR 31170, August 17, 1988) andwere applicable to all forms of K101 and K102 wastewaters (i.e., they didnot distinguish between high arsenic or low arsenic subcategories). Thesepromulgated standards were based on the same D004 wastewater treatmentdata used in today's proposal to establish arsenic standards for otherK, U, and P wastes. In the process of reevaluating the D004 wastewatertreatment data for today's proposed rule, however, EPA discovered an errorin the calculation of the promulgated K101 and K102 wastewater standardsfor the metal constituents. The Agency is proposing today to correct thiserror by amending the wastewater standards for the metal constituents (arsenic,cadmium, lead, and mercury) in K101 and K102. Therefore, a new treatmentstandard of 0.79 mg/l for arsenic, 0.24 mg/l for cadmium, 0.17 mg/l forlead, and 0.82 mg/l for mercury is being proposed. These proposed standardsare based on the same D004 data but using a different data set than thatused for the development of the promulgated standards. Since there wasno error in the calculation of the promulgated standards for the organicconstituents, the Agency is not proposing to change the standards for theorganics present in K101 and K102 wastewaters. The promulgated standardsfor the organics are being presented for convenience of the reader andare not being reconsidered. Therefore, no comment on this subject willbe accepted. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4><T4>D</T4>004, <T4>K</T4>031, <T4>K</T4>084, <T4>P</T4>010, <T4>P</T4>011, <T4>P</T4>012, <T4>P</T4>036, <T4>P</T4>038, <T4>and</T4> <T4>U</T4>136<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic<D>0.79</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,9.1</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4><T4>D</T4>004, <T4>K</T4>031, <T4>K</T4>084, <T4>P</T4>010, <T4>P</T4>011, <T4>P</T4>012, <T4>P</T4>036, <T4>P</T4>038, <T4>and</T4> U136<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, EP leachate (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic<D>5.6</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for D</T4>010, <T4>P</T4>103, <T4>P</T4>114, <T4>U</T4>204 and <T4>U</T4>205<ITAG tagnum="96"> [Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium<D>0.79</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,9.1</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for D</T4>010, <T4>P</T4>103, <T4>P</T4>114, <T4>U</T4>204 and <T4>U</T4>205 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, EP leachate (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Selenium<D>5.6 </D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>101<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Ortho-nitroaniline<D>0.27</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic<D>0.79</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>0.24</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>0.17</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury<D> 0.082 </D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>102<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total Composition (mg/l)</H1>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Ortho-nitrophenol<D>0.028</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Arsenic<D>0.79</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Cadmium<D>0.24</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Lead<D>0.17</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Mercury<D>0.082 </D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(4,4,0),i1,s50,9.1 </C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> K101 <T4>and K102</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters*] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, EP leachate (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic<D>5.6 </D></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="59"><F>* This proposes to remove subcategories based on high and low arseniccontent</F></ITAG> <T3>c. Barium. </T3>The Agency has identified two hazardous wastes thatpotentially contain high levels of barium. These include P013 (barium cyanide)and D005 (EP toxic for barium; 100 mg/l barium as measured in an EP leachate).Treatment standards for cyanides contained in P013 wastes were promulgatedwith the Final Rule for second Third Wastes (54 FR 26614 (June 23, 1989)).At the same time, treatment standards for barium in P013 wastewaters werenot promulgated based on the lack of treatment data. Today's notice proposestreatment standards for P013 wastewaters and all D005 wastes.According to the periodic chart of elements, barium is a group II elementthat has chemical properties similar to magnesium and calcium. In aqueousconditions it typically exists as a divalent, cationic species. This behavioris important, in that selection and performance of treatment technologiesfor barium is somewhat similar to most other metals based on this cationicbehavior in aqueous conditions. However, due to differences in solubilitiesof certain salts of barium compared to other metals, treatment technologiesfor both wastewaters and nonwastewaters containing barium are slightlydifferent compared to wastes containing only other metal constituents.The treatment standards presented in today's preamble for all barium wastesare based on a limited amount of treatment data. In this notice, the Agencyis soliciting data on the characterization and treatment of all wastescontaining barium. Copies of any additional data pertaining to these proposedtreatment standards that may be submitted during the public comment period,can be specifically requested in writing by identifying the request fordata as ``Additional data on treatment of barium_Section III.A.5.c.''.See section III.A.1.i. of today's preamble for additional information onprocedures for requesting additional data on specific standards.<T3>(1) Identification of BDAT for Wastewaters. </T3>When evaluating treatmenttechnologies to establish wastewater treatment standards for barium wastes,the Agency believes that it must consider not only the efficiency of removalof barium from the wastewater, but also the physical and chemical stateof the precipitated barium salts that end up in the wastewater treatmentresidues.While some data indicate that barium can be removed from wastewaters byusing lime (calcium hydroxide) or caustic (sodium hydroxide) as a precipitatingreagent (resulting in precipitation of the barium as a hydroxide salt (bariumhydroxide)), barium is typically precipitated as a sulfate salt (bariumsulfate) using sodium sulfate, ferric sulfate, or aluminum sulfate as aprecipitating reagent. Most other cationic metals are typically removedfrom wastewaters based on precipitation as hydroxides or sulfides. Whilebarium hydroxide is slightly soluble in water, barium sulfate is practicallyinsoluble in water. Although lime or caustic may be effective in precipitatingbarium from wastewaters, sulfate precipitation should result in a precipitatethat is less soluble in water than the hydroxide salt.To further complicate matters, the resultant nonwastewater treatment residuescontaining barium sulfate salts may not be effectively stabilized by conventionalstabilization reagents. This is primarily due to the anticipated presenceof excess soluble sulfate (used as the precipitating reagent) which isknown to interfere with the cementitious reactions. (Note: Conventionalstabilization processes are typically applied to wastes containing primarilymetal hydroxide salts). Therefore, in development of the appropriate BDATtreatment standards for wastewaters containing barium, the decrease insolubility of the resultant nonwastewaters containing barium sulfate (versusthe more soluble barium hydroxide) must be balanced against the potentialdifficulty in conventional stabilization processes for the barium sulfatenonwastewaters. However, there are stabilization reagents (such as certaintypes of Portland cements) that have been developed that are specificallydesigned to handle materials containing high sulfates.Due to a well established chemical relationship known as the ``common ioneffect'' and due to the relatively higher solubility of barium hydroxide(compared to barium sulfate), there exists a reasonable potential for anincrease in leachability of the resulting wastewater treatment sludges(either the barium hydroxide or the barium sulfate) during co-disposalwith alkaline wastes or materials. This potential for increased leachabilityunder these conditions is a legitimate concern, in that some operatorsof hazardous landfills co-dispose all ``metal'' wastes and it is typicalpractice to add excess lime to prevent migration of the other metals priorto disposal.Thus, EPA solicits comments on whether it should (as part of the treatmentstandard) specify the use of sulfate as the precipitating reagent for allwastewaters containing barium. In a similar manner, the Agency solicitscomment on whether it should establish disposal requirements under 40 CFRParts 264 and 265 for all barium wastewaters that would include sulfateprecipitation followed by segregation of the treatment residuals from alkalinematerials (i.e., in either monofills or separate subcells within a landfill).EPA notes that these proposed requirements may then be promulgated as additionalrequirements to meeting the proposed concentration-based standards.Additional information indicates that barium could be precipitated as bariumcarbonate at pH 10-10.5, with lime used for pH adjustment, as an alternativetreatment technology for barium wastewaters. Ion exchange also has beenreported as achieving extremely high removal efficiencies. The Agency,however, lacks data to support these treatment technologies as being BDATfor D005 wastes.For some barium wastewaters, more extensive treatment trains may be necessaryin order to treat hexavalent chromium, other metals, and organics whichcould possibly interfere with the treatment of the barium. A reductionstep for hexavalent chromium and an oxidation step (with reagents suchas hydrogen peroxide or hypochlorite) may be necessary to treat the organics.However, the Agency currently lacks data indicating that the proposed concentration-basedstandards cannot be achieved for these type of wastes, and anticipatesthat pretreatment steps such as hexavalent chromium reduction and chemicaloxidation of organics could remove these potential interferences. The Agencyspecifically solicits comments on the applicability of these and otherpretreatment technologies for barium wastewaters, as well as data indicatingthe achievability of the concentration-based standards proposed in thefollowing sections.The Agency has very little data on precipitation of barium from RCRA hazardouswastewaters identified as P013 or D005. However, the Agency's Office ofWater does have data from its analysis of various treated wastewaters underthe Agency's Effluent Guidelines Program. In the absence of treatment dataspecific to P013 or D005 wastewaters, the Agency believes that these datafrom the Effluent Guidelines Program can be transferred to develop treatmentstandards for P013 and D005 wastewaters.Based on these treatment data, the Agency is proposing a treatment standardof 1.15 mg/l barium for all D005 wastewaters. As discussed in detail insection III.C. of today's preamble, the Agency has initially determinedthat it has the authority to establish treatment standards below the characteristiclevel for these wastes or at least to make failure to treat to the lowerlevel a violation of Section 3004 (m). The Agency is also soliciting commentson an option of limiting the treatment standard for D005 wastewaters tothe characteristic level of 100 mg/l.Based on Effluent Guidelines data, the Agency is also proposing a treatmentstandard for barium in P013 wastewaters of 1.15 mg/l barium. While P013wastes (barium cyanide) are typically generated as nonwastewaters, theAgency expects that wastewater forms of these wastes may be generated fromincidental spills or from the treatment process itself and thus would requiretreatment standards. The Agency expects that untreated wastewaters willbe relatively dilute, and thus would not expect to be difficult to treat.The Agency points out that it is not reopening the promulgated treatmentstandards for cyanides in P013 for comment.<T3>(2) Identification of BDAT for Nonwastewaters. </T3>For nonwastewaterforms of P013 and D005, which primarily consist of inorganic barium saltsother than hydroxides or sulfates, the Agency believes that the bariumcan be dissolved and reprecipitated as the sulfate or carbonate in orderto generate a treatment residual meeting the characteristic level. In addition,barium may be able to be leached from these wastes by concentrated strongacid solutions, with the acid leachate subsequently neutralized and treatedby sulfate or carbonate precipitation. The Agency is proposing a requiredmethod as the treatment standard for these barium wastes. D005 nonwastewatersmust be treated by acid or water leaching followed by chemical precipitationas sulfate or carbonate followed by stabilization.For D005 wastes that are generated containing high levels of organics theAgency believes that these wastes can be incinerated prior to stabilizationof the ash. The Agency is soliciting information on whether these wastesactually exist, the concentration of barium and organics within these wastes,and treatment data for these wastes. If the Agency finds that these wastesdo exist and treatment data is submitted, the Agency may define these wastesas a separate treatability group based on the level of organics and bariumand promulgate the resultant concentration-based standards based on thesedata. However, information is submitted that these wastes exist but notreatment data are submitted from which concentration-based standards canbe developed, the Agency may promulgate ``Incineration Followed by Stabilizationas a Method of Treatment'' for these wastes.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>  BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D005 <T4>and </T4>P013<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Acid or water leaching followed by chemical precipitation as sulfateor carbonate or stabilization as methods of treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="59"><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D005 <T4>and</T4> P013<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any 24 hour composite sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Barium<D>1.15</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>d. Cadmium.</T3> The criterion for classifying a solid waste as a D006hazardous waste is the presence of cadmium in a concentration exceeding1.0 mg/l, as measured in an EP leachate. On July 8, 1987, a 100 mg/l statutoryprohibition level went into effect for liquid hazardous wastes containingcadmium (see the California list final rule, 52 FR 25760). The Agency receiveddata during the comment period for the California list rule (that it presentedin a subsequent Notice of Data Availability) indicating that the full rangeof California list wastes containing cadmium, except those containing highlevels of oil and grease, could be treated to a concentration level of1.0 mg/l through precipitation of wastewaters and stabilization of nonwastewaters.The l.0 mg/l level was not promulgated at that time, but EPA has used thedata received in response to both the California list proposal and theNotice of Data Availability, along with other waste specific data, to developtoday's proposed treatment standards.Based on information from the 1986 Bureau of Mines report on the productionof cadmium and cadmium salts, cadmium is typically extracted from sulfideminerals bearing zinc, lead, and copper. Cadmium is used primarily in electroplatingand in the production of nickel/cadmium rechargeable batteries (as wellas other types of batteries), pigments, and plastics. Other uses of cadmiuminclude television picture tube and fluorescent light phosphors, catalystsfor primary ester and alcohol production, nuclear reactor controls, firedetection alloys, alloys and solders, and copper hardening agents.The treatment standards presented in today's preamble for all cadmium wastesare based on a limited amount of treatment data. In this notice, the Agencyis soliciting data on the characterization and treatment of all wastescontaining cadmium. Copies of any additional data pertaining to these proposedtreatment standards submitted during the public comment period can be requestedin writing by identifying the request for data as ``Additional data ontreatment of cadmium_Section III.A.5.d.''. See section III.A.1.i. of today'spreamble for information on procedures for requesting additional data onspecific standards.Treatment data indicate that cadmium follows treatment patterns of mostother metallic waste in that conventional metal hydroxide or sulfide precipitationand stabilization appear effective for cadmium-bearing wastes. Based onall available waste characterization and treatment data, the Agency isproposing to group all D006 wastes into one of three treatability groups:(1) Wastewaters, (2) nonwastewaters, and (c) cadmium-containing batteries.The Agency is requesting data that will assist in further categorizingD006 wastes into these (and any other) treatability groups.<T3>(1) Identification of BDAT for Wastewaters.</T3> This treatabilitygroup encompasses the largest volume of cadmium wastes, which are generatedprimarily as electroplating rinsewaters. The technologies typically usedfor treating these wastewaters include chemical precipitation (as a hydroxide,carbonate, phosphate, sulfide, or ferrous sulfate coprecipitant), ion exchange,activated carbon adsorption, and evaporative and electrolytic recovery.The Agency has very little data on precipitation of cadmium from RCRA hazardouswastewaters identified as D006. However, the Agency's Office of Water doeshave data from its analysis of various treated wastewaters under the Agency'sEffluent Guidelines Program. In the absence of treatment data specificto D006 wastewaters, the Agency believes that these data from the EffluentGuidelines Program can be transferred to develop treatment standards forD006 wastewaters. The data show that the treatment provided by these industriescan reduce the concentration of cadmium in the wastewater to levels belowthe characteristic level of 1.0 mg/l. Therefore, the Agency is proposinga concentration based treatment standard for D006 wastewaters based onthe performance of precipitation in treating cadmium wastewaters.Based on these treatment data, the Agency is proposing a treatment standardof 0.20 mg/l cadmium for all D006 wastewaters. As discussed in detail insection III.C. of today's preamble, the Agency has initially determinedthat it has the authority to establish treatment standards below the characteristiclevel for these wastes or at least to make failure to treat to the lowerlevel a violation of section 3004(m). The use of other technologies toachieve this concentration-based treatment standard is not prohibited bytoday's rule.<T3>(2) Identification of BDAT for Nonwastewaters.</T3> Wastes which arecomprised of concentrated cadmium metal, such as the residuals from therecovery of K061 (electric arc furnace dust containing cadmium) and zincmining wastes, are amenable to recovery, direct reuse, or stabilization.The Agency has data on the stabilization of nonwastewaters indicating thatcadmium can be effectively stabilized to levels below the characteristiclevel. For example, the Agency has data on the stabilization of K061 (electricarc furnace dust containing cadmium primarily in the form of cadmium oxides)nonwastewaters indicating that cadmium can be stabilized to a level of0.14 mg/l using TCLP extraction (53 FR 3l164). Furthermore, the Agencyhas data indicating that stabilized cadmium in F006 (wastewater treatmentsludges containing primarily cadmium in the form of cadmium hydroxides)can achieve a TCLP extract level of 0.066 mg/l (53 FR 31153). Based onthese available data, the Agency believes that all cadmium nonwastewaterscan either be stabilized such that the technologies reduce the leachabilityand total composition of cadmium in D006 nonwastewaters to below the characteristiclevel.As discussed in detail in section III.C. of today's preamble, the Agencyhas initially determined that it may have the authority to establish treatmentstandards below the characteristic level for these wastes or at least tomake failure to treat to the lower level a violation of section 3004 (m).The Agency is proposing two options for the development of treatment standardsfor D006 nonwastewaters.The first option is to propose a concentration-based treatment standardfor D006 nonwastewaters of 0.14 mg/l based on a transfer of K061 data.The Agency believes that this transfer is technically feasible due to factthat K061 wastes probably contain cadmium oxides which appear to be slightlymore difficult to stabilize than the cadmium hydroxide found in a F006wastes. Waste K061 is also a particularly difficult matrix to stabilize(see e.g., Comments of Steel Bar Mills Association and other steel producers)in the First Third rulemaking. The second option is to propose a methodof treatment of stabilization or metals recovery. The Agency is solicitingcomments on the concentration of cadmium that can be recovered and whetherthe Agency can identify a concentration of cadmium in nonwastewaters thatis not amenable to metals recovery.<T3>(3) Identification of BDAT for Cadmium-Containing Batteries. </T3>Nickel/cadmium rechargeable batteries are widely used in many householdelectronic products and are also used industrially in railroad signaling,diesel locomotive starting, commercial and jet aircraft starting, satellites,missile guidance systems, television and camera lighting, portable hospitalequipment, computer memories, pinball machines, and gasoline pumps. Variationsof this battery are the silver/cadmium cell and the mercury/cadmium battery,which are more costly and limited in their use.Because the Agency does not have adequate data to establish a concentration-basedstandard, the Agency is proposing a treatment standard for cadmium-containingbatteries expressed as ``Recovery as a Method of Treatment''. The Bureauof Mines has conducted studies on pyrometallurgical techniques for recyclingnickel/cadmium batteries. Data indicates that cadmium-containing batteriesmay be recycled through the use of smelting technologies. More informationon this data can be found in the background document for cadmium wastes.EPA is specifically requesting data on the recovery of cadmium-containingbatteries.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D006<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any 24 hour composite sample</H1><H2>Total Composition (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>0.20</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D006<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>0.14</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,4),s25</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D006<ITAG tagnum="96">[Cadmium Batteries]</ITAG><H1>Thermal recovery as a method of treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><T3>e. Chromium. </T3> U032 (calcium chromate) and D007 (EP toxic for chromium;5.0 mg/l) are two of the many RCRA hazardous wastes that are listed fortheir chromium content. Typically, these wastes contain chromium as trivalentor hexavalent cations. Primarily in untreated wastewaters, chromium ispresent in its hexavalent state and is reduced by treatment to the trivalentstate. The Agency is proposing to regulate chromium in wastes as ``total''chromium rather than distinguishing between these two valence states. Thisis primarily because of the difficulty in analyzing treatment residuesfor hexavalent chromium. (Note: Concentrations of trivalent chromium aredetermined by subtracting the concentration of hexavalent chromium fromtotal chromium concentrations).The Agency has data treatment of chromium in wastewaters such as K062 wastesthat contain significant concentrations of chromium and other metals. Thesedata on K062 wastes indicated treatment of up to 7,000 ppm of total chromium.This is similar to waste characterization data on other wastewaters (suchas those generated in battery manufacturing) indicating concentrationsof up to 10,000 ppm of total chromium in untreated waste. The data fortreatment of nonwastewaters (sludges or solids) indicate that high levelsof chromium in hydroxide sludges, incinerator ash, and in furnace dust,can be treated by conventional stabilization processes to below the characteristiclevel for D007.<T3>(1) Identification of BDAT for D007 Wastewaters.  </T3>Treatment dataavailable to the Agency indicate that chemical reduction processes canconvert a significant range of concentrations of hexavalent chromium inwastes to chromium in the trivalent state using chemical reducing agentssuch as sulfur dioxide, sodium bisulfite, metabisulfite, hydrosulfite,or ferrous sulfate. The trivalent chromium is then removed, usually byhydroxide precipitation. The Agency has treatment data on chromium reductionfollowed by precipitation and sludge dewatering for K062 wastes. The Agencybelieves that K062 would be similar or more difficult to treat than D007wastes because of the high concentration of chromium and other metals inK062 wastes. Therefore, the Agency is transferring the performance datafor K062 to D007 wastewaters and is proposing a treatment standard of 0.32mg/l. The Agency is soliciting additional treatment performance data, includingdata on ion exchange processes which can remove hexavalent chromium directlyfrom wastewaters.(2) <T3>Identification of BDAT for D007 Nonwastewaters.</T3> Treatment dataavailable to the Agency indicate that D007 nonwastewaters can be treatedby stabilization provided the chromium has been reduced to the trivalentstate. The Agency has performance data from the stabilization of F006 wastesthat contain high concentrations of chromium. The data indicates that totalchromium can be stabilized to 5.2 mg/l as analyzed by the TCLP analysis.For the K062 nonwastewaters, the concentration of total chromium in thenonwastewaters did not need to be stabilized. The reason was during theprecipitation step, the treater added lime such that it reduced the mobilityof chromium and other metals that were present in the wastes. This informationjustifies that fact that chromium wastes can be easily stabilized.Therefore, the Agency has two sets of treatment data for chromium containingnonwastewaters. The Agency believes that the F006 wastes could have containedhexavalent chromium as opposed to trivalent chromium. The reason for thisis that the Agency believes that a F006 wastes is generated from the treatmentof electroplating rinsewaters by alkaline chlorination treatment ratherthan a chromium reduction treatment. An alkaline chlorination process wouldnot reduce the hexavalent chromium to trivalent. Therefore the Agency isproposing a treatment standard for D007 nonwastewaters of 0.094 mg/l basedon an analysis of TCLP extracts and based on the performance of chromiumreduction followed by lime and sulfide precipitation and dewatering forK062 wastes. The Agency is soliciting comments and treatment data fromindustry on whether this treatment standard is achievable for all D007nonwastewaters. If comments indicate that the standard is not achievable,the Agency may promulgate the 5.2 mg/l treatment standard based on a transferof the performance of stabilization for the F006 wastes.(3) <T3>Identification of BDAT for Calcium Chromate.</T3>  In today's proposedrule, the Agency is proposing wastewater and nonwastewater concentration-basedtreatment standards for chromium in this waste (U 032). BDAT for wastewatersand nonwastewaters are based on a transfer of the treatment performanceof chemical reduction followed by lime/sulfide precipitation and filtrationfor K062 wastes.The Agency believes that the transfer of the performance data for the treatmentof K062 to calcium chromate wastewaters is technically feasible due tothe high concentration of chromium in K062 wastewater.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D007 <T4>and </T4>U032<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total)<D>0.094</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D007 <T4>and </T4>U032<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total)<D>0.32</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>f.

Lead, as a metal, is usedas an industrial raw material in the manufacture of batteries, pigments,leaded glass, fuels, photographic materials, matches, explosives, and inelectroplating baths. Lead is also used in the iron and steel industryand in the mining industry. Typically the lead in the D008 nonwastewatersmay appear as lead in its elemental form (i.e., solid lead) or as chemicalsalts. In aqueous solutions (such as wastewaters), lead can easily be precipitatedby adding lime, carbonate, or sulfides. This behavior is important, inthat selection and performance of treatment technologies for lead is somewhatsimilar to other metals, based on this cationic behavior in aqueous conditions.Lead salts typically contain lead in the divalent state and are mostlyinsoluble in water. The nitrate, Pb(NO<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>, and the acetate, Pb(C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>3</T2>O<T2>2</T2>)<T2>2</T2>, are the only common soluble salts. The solubility of thesetwo salts form the basis for certain analytical determinations of leadconcentrations in some particular matrices. The treatment standards presented in today's preamble for all lead wastesare based on a limited amount of treatment data. In this notice, the Agencyis soliciting data on the characterization and treatment of all wastescontaining lead. Copies of any additional data pertaining to these proposedtreatment standards that may be submitted during the public comment periodcan be requested in writing by identifying the request for data as ``Additionaldata on treatment of lead_Section III.A.5.e.''. See Section III.A.1.i.of today's preamble for information on procedures for requesting additionaldata on specific standards. <T3>(1) Treatment Standards for Wastewaters. </T3>When evaluating treatmenttechnologies to establish wastewater treatment standards for lead wastes,the Agency believes that it must consider not only the efficiency of removalof lead from the wastewater, but also the chemical state of the precipitatedlead salts that end up in the wastewater treatment residuals. Most of the data indicates that lead oxides can be removed from wastewatersby using carbonate or hydroxide as precipitating reagent. In most precipitationtreatment systems, two factors influence lead removal. These are lead solubilityand lead precipitate settleability. Lead oxides are more insoluble in carbonaterather than lead hydroxide. (Note: Lead hydroxide is actually amphotericand will become more soluble as the pH moves beyond optimum insolubility.)This suggests that a method of treatment for lead in wastewaters shouldbe precipitation with carbonate, followed by sludge dewatering. The Agencyis requesting comments on the approach of specifying a precipitant withthe method of treatment. The Agency has data on the treatment of wastewaters containing lead byprecipitation with lime and sulfide filtration, and settling for K062 andD008 mixed wastes. The Agency believes that these data represent a matrixthat is very difficult to treat since it consists of other dissolved metalsin concentrations up to 7,000 ppm. While the lead concentration in K062waste ranged up to only 200 ppm, treatment by precipitation acts to concentratethe lead in the sludge. K062 wastewaters were treated by chemical reduction,followed by precipitation with lime and sulfide and sludge dewatering.The sludge generated from this process contained leachable lead concentrationsof less than 0.10 mg/l, indicating that the sludge did not need furthertreatment. The wastewater residual from this treatment contained lead concentrationsof less than 0.01 mg/l. These data indicate that the performance of precipitationwith lime and sulfide can achieve concentration levels lower than the EPtoxic concentration for lead (i.e., 5 mg/l). Therefore, the Agency is proposing two options for treatment standardsfor D008 wastewaters. The first option is a treatment standard of 0.04mg/l 1ead for all D008 wastewaters. As discussed in detail in section III.C.of today's preamble, the Agency has initially determined that it has theauthority to establish treatment standards below the characteristic levelfor these wastes or at least to make failure to treat to the lower levela violation of Section 3004 (m). However, the Agency is proposing a secondoption of limiting the treatment standards for D008 wastewaters to thecharacteristic level of 5.0 mg/l. The Agency specifically solicits commentson these two options. The Agency also solicits comment on use of the standardsdeveloped for the secondary and primary lead industries as part of theAgency's effluent limitations guidelines program. The constituents for which U144, U145, and U146 wastes are listed are allsoluble salt forms of lead. The constituents for which P110, U144, andU146 are listed are organic forms of lead. While all of these wastes aretypically generated as nonwastewaters, the Agency expects that wastewaterforms of these wastes may be generated from incidental spills or from atreatment process itself, and thus would require treatment standards. TheAgency expects that untreated wastewaters will be more dilute than theuntreated K062 wastewaters that were used to develop the treatment standards,and thus would be expected to be less difficult to treat. Given that: (1) U144, U145, and U146 are all soluble lead compounds, (2)untreated K062 wastewaters are expected to be more difficult to treat thanuntreated P110, U144, U145, and U146 wastewaters, and (3) the performancedata demonstrate that the lead in K062 wastewaters can effectively be removed,EPA is proposing to transfer K062 performance data and concentration-basedtreatment standard of 0.04 mg/l for P110, U144, U145, and U146 wastewaters.<T3>(2) Treatment Standards for Nonwastewaters Containing Lead. </T3> TheAgency has identified many types of D008 nonwastewaters that are different,and can be classified as those wastes that can be stabilized, recycled,and incinerated. The Agency has proposed a cut-off concentration of 2.5%total lead as a means of distinguishing between those essentially inorganicnonwastewaters containing recyclable levels of lead and those which canbe effectively stabilized. This cut-off level has been proposed based ona limited amount of data from both recycling and stabilization of wastescontaining lead. <T3>(a) Standards for Wastes in the Low Lead Subcategory.</T3> For D008nonwastewaters, the Agency has identified two sets of stabilization dataon electroplating wastewater treatment sludges (F006) and wastewater treatmentsludges from explosives manufacturing (K046). Data on electroplating nonwastewatersindicate that wastes with total lead concentration of 24,500 can be reducedto lead concentrations of 0.51 ppm using the TCLP extract test. At thesame time, the Agency has treatment data for K046 wastes that contain totallead concentrations of 1,000 ppm with reductions to 0.l8 ppm of leachablelead. Both of these data sets for diverse waste types indicate that conventionalstabilization processes can reduce the leachability of lead to concentrationslower than the EP levels.Therefore, using the treatment data for F006 wastes, the Agency is proposinga treatment standard of 0.51 mg/l 1eachable lead for D008 wastes that canbe effectively stabilized. In order to define this subcategory, the Agencyexamined the available data and determined that total concentrations oflead up to 2.5 percent can be effectively stabilized. The Agency is proposingthis level as a cut-off for those D008 nonwastewaters that can be stabilized.Based on this 2.5% level, the Agency is identifying these wastes that canbe stabilized as wastes in the D008 Low Lead Subcategory. The Agency believesthat these data for F006 and K046 represent the treatment of wastes thatare more difficult to stabilize (due to the presence of organo-lead initiatingcompounds and residuals organics in the K046 wastes, and high dissolvedmetals and oil and grease in the F006 wastes).As discussed in detail in section III.C. of today's preamble, the Agencyhas initially determined that it has the authority to establish treatmentstandards below the characteristic level for these wastes or at least tomake failure to treat to the lower level a violation of section 3004 (m).However, the Agency is proposing a second option of limiting the treatmentstandard for these D008 nonwastewater treatment sludges to the characteristiclevel. The Agency is soliciting comments on this approach and on the definitionof stabilized D008 nonwastewaters based on a 2.5 percent cutoff concentrationof lead.<T3>(b) Standards for High Lead Subcategory.</T3> In determining whichD008 lead wastes are amenable to thermal recovery, the Agency has datathat indicate that wastes containing concentrations of lead as low as 5percent can be recovered.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>(Note: </T4>This 5% level correlates well with the proposed cut-offlevel of 2.5% based on the performance of stabilization.)</ITAG>Thus, the Agency is defining wastes in the High Lead Subcategory as thosewastes containing greater than or equal to 2.5% lead (based on an analysisof total lead concentration in the waste). The Agency has identified someparticular D008 wastes which appear to have good recovery potential, suchas lead acid batteries, lead dross, and electric arc furnace dust.Data available to the Agency indicates that lead can be recovered fromelectric arc furnace dust (K061) by high temperature metals recovery. SomeK061 wastes contained total lead concentrations up to 14 percent, and werereduced to leachate levels well below the characteristic level of 5.0<ITAG tagnum="10">mg/l. Based on these data, the Agency believes that residues fromthermal recovery of D008 wastes containing high levels of lead will nolonger leach lead above the EP toxic level. (See also the discussion onrecovery of lead acid batteries and the solicitation of comments and databelow.) Therefore, the Agency is proposing a treatment standard of ``ThermalRecovery as a Method of Treatment'' for wastes in the High Lead Subcategory.<T3>(c) Standards for Lead Acid Batteries Subcategory.</T3> Currently,the Agency does not have waste characterization and treatment data fromthe recycling of lead acid batteries (i.e., influent lead concentrationsand total and leachable residual data). Therefore, the Agency is solicitingrecovery data of lead from secondary smelting operations. In particular,the Agency is interested in the minimum concentration of lead that canbe recovered from other D008 wastes, the resultant waste characteristicsassociated with the slag (assuming that the slag is either a D008 waste,or comes from smelting a waste that is not indigenous to the industrialfurnace), and any treatment data on the slag. As a result, the Agency is proposing treatment standards for non-indigenousrecyclable D008 wastes (identified as the D008 High Lead Subcategory) basedon the performance of the high temperature metals recycling of K061 wastesthat contain significant concentrations of lead. (Residues from recyclingindigenous D008 materials would be subject to the D008 standard if suchresidues exhibit EP toxicity for lead, and their subcategory would be determinedat the time of their generation.) Incidentally, the Agency notes in response to inquiries from the affectedindustries that lead acid batteries themselves, when stored before landdisposal, are not considered to be land disposed. This is because the batteryis considered to be a container (see 40 CFR 264.314(d)(3)). Battery storage,however, typically is subject to the subpart J storage standards (relatingto secure storage, secondary containment in some instances, and other requirements).For the lead acid batteries treatability group, the Agency is proposingmetals recovery as a method of treatment. The Agency believes that mostof the treaters for lead acid batteries are using a recovery process. Thesestandards only apply for lead acid batteries that are identified as RCRAhazardous wastes and that are not elsewhere excluded from regulation underthe land disposal restrictions of 40 CFR 268 or exempted under other EPAregulations (see 40 CFR 266.80). <T3>(d) Standards for P110, U144, and U146 Nonwastewaters.</T3> The Agencyhas determined that some nonwastewater forms of lead wastes including P110,U144, U146, and some D008 wastes, would need to be incinerated prior tostabilization due to the presence of high concentrations of organics inorder to achieve a treatment standard based on stabilization. This is primarilybecause the organics typically interfere with conventional stabilizationprocesses (particularly at concentrations exceeding 1% TOC). The Agencyhas data on the incineration of organic wastes containing up to 1,000 mg/kglead (such as K048/K051 and K087 wastes) followed by stabilization of theash. These data indicate that the proposed standard (i.e. 0.51 mg/1 leachablelead) for D008 nonwastewaters in the Low Lead Subcategory based on stabilizationcan be achieved for wastes that also contain significant concentrationsof organics, provided the organics are destroyed by pretreatment. The Agencyis therefore proposing that this standard is applicable to those U andP lead wastes that are organo-lead compounds, i.e., P110, U144, and U146.This is further supported by the fact that the lead contained in the K048-K052petroleum refinery wastes that were incinerated, probably was present astetraethyl lead thus supporting the extrapolation to P110, off-specificationtetraethyl 1ead. Lead acetate (U144) and lead subacetate (U146) are anticipatedto be less difficult (or at least of similar difficulty) to treat thantetraethyl lead. <T3>(e) Standards for Radioactive Lead Solids Subcategory.</T3> The Agencyis also proposing treatment standards for radioactive lead solids. Theselead solids include, but are not limited to, all forms of lead shielding,lead ``pigs'', and other elemental forms of lead. These lead solids donot include treatment residuals such as hydroxide sludges, other wastewatertreatment residuals, or incinerator ashes that can undergo conventionalpozzolanic stabilization, nor do they include organo-lead materials thatcan be incinerated and then stabilized as ash. These wastes are differentthan the other D008 nonwastewaters containing high levels of lead, becauseof their radioactivity. EPA does not believe that metal recovery (i.e., smelting) is an availabletechnology for radioactive solids. Any lead recovery would be radioactive,and thus unusable. If the radioactive lead was smelted along with normallead, the entire mass recovered would be unusable. However, conventional stabilization technologies generally should not beimpacted by the presence of radioactive versus nonradioactive lead. Asa result, the Agency is not subcategorizing wastewater treatment residuesand incinerator ash containing radioactive lead or other metals exceptfor purposes of determining availability of treatment capacity (i.e., stabilizationprocesses for radioactive materials should employ special safety precautionsdue to the radioactivity). Therefore, the Agency has developed a separatetreatability group and BDAT for the specified radioactive lead solids.For these radioactive lead solids, the Agency is proposing a treatmentstandard of ``Surface Deactivation or Removal of Radioactive Lead PortionsFollowed by Encapsulation; or Direct Encapsulation as Methods of Treatment''.The Agency believes that most radioactive lead results from the use ofthe elemental lead (a solid) either directly or indirectly as a shieldfrom radioactivity. Typically, the radioactivity penetrates slowly intoone side of the lead (shield), thus providing the necessary protection.Therefore, depending upon the thickness of the lead shield the radioactiveportion of the lead may be able to be shaved off from the nonradioactiveportion. The remaining nonradioactive lead would then be subject to thetreatment standard for High Lead wastes, ``Thermal Recovery as a Methodof Treatment''. The radioactive portion (or in some cases the entire shieldor solid) would then be either macro- or micro-encapsulated into a protectivematerial that would prevent the lead from leaching in the disposal environment.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D008, P110, U144, U145, U146 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.040</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for P11O, U144, U145, and U146 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, TCLP (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.51</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D008 <T4>Low Lead Subcategory_Less Than </T4>2.5% <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, TCLP (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.51</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,4),s25</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D008 <T4>High Lead Subcategory Greater Than or Equal</T4> to 2.5% <T4>Lead </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Thermal recovery as a method of treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,4),s25 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D008 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Lead Acid Batteries*] </ITAG><H1>Thermal recovery as a method of treatment</H1> <F>*This standard only applies to lead acid batteries that are identifiedas RCRA hazardous wastes and that are not excluded elsewhere from regulationunder the land disposal restrictions of 40 CFR 268 or exempted under otherEPA regulations (see 40 CFR 266.80).</F></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,4),s25 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D008 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Radioactive Lead Solids*] </ITAG><H1>Surface deactivation or removal of radioactive lead portions followedby encapsulation; or direct encapsulation of radioactive lead solids asmethods of treatment</H1></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="59"><ITAG tagnum="22"> *These lead solids include, but are not limited to, all forms oflead shielding, lead ``pigs'', and other elemental forms of lead.

The Agency is grouping these wastes togetherin order to simplify the explanation of the chemistry of mercury and theoperational treatment principles of technologies for treating the relatedmercury wastes. <T3>(1) Review of Applicable Technologies for Nonwastewaters_(a) ThermalRecovery Processes.</T3> Based on the available treatment data from thermalrecovery processes for K071, K106, and for cinnabar ores, EPA is proposingthermal recovery as part of the treatment standards for many of the nonwastewaterforms of these six mercury wastes. EPA has examined data on the mercurycontent of residues from roasting/retorting of K071 and K106 wastes, andbelieves that it shows substantial reductions in mercury mobility. Thedata indicated that mercury can be recovered from these wastes such thatthe residues contain less than 16 mg/kg of total mercury. In addition, EPA believes the thermal processing of cinnabar ores simulatesthe roasting/retorting of mercury sulfide containing wastes. These additionaldata indicates that the thermal processing of cinnabar ores yields a calcinatedresidue containing 100 mg/kg total mercury, and none of treated residuesexceed EP toxicity Levels for mercury. As a result, EPA is proposing touse the lowest concentration based number achieved by these two sets ofthermal recovery data, i.e., the 16 mg/kg, to reflect the level of mercuryamenable to recovery. It is not clear from the available data whether organo-mercury wastes (likeP065 and P092) can be retorted directly, or if the organic fraction mustbe destroyed first. Consequently, for certain organo-mercury wastes, EPAis proposing an initial treatment step to destroy the organics followedby thermal recovery of mercury if the incineration residues contain sufficientmercury to be amenable to recovery. The Agency is aware of other thermal processes, such as scrap metal distillationincorporating steam stripping and vacuum distillation, that are used forrecovery of mercury from debris and equipment. However, the Agency hasno particular data from these processes for use in the development of treatmentstandards. Therefore, the Agency is soliciting data and information onthese technologies. <T3>(b) Acid Leaching.</T3> The promulgated treatment standards for K07lnonwastewaters in the First Third rule based on the performance of a treatmentprocess involving acid leaching to solubilize and extract the mercury containedin the K071 brine sludge and later convert the mercury to a relativelyinsoluble mercury sulfide sludge. (See further discussion of proposed rulefor K071 in 53 FR 11758-11759 (April 8, 1988) and final rule in 53 FR 31166-31167(August 17, 1988).) The Agency is using these data and promulgated standardsfor transfer to wastes that contain less than 16 mg/kg total mercury asgenerated (i.e., wastes with insufficient mercury to warrant recovery).Residues from this acid leaching process must be evaluated for mercurycontent to determine whether they must undergo thermal recovery. <T3>(c) Stabilization.</T3> Existing stabilization data for K106 nonwastewaterscontaining over 2% total mercury (by weight) indicate that the overallleachability of mercury from the K106 wastes actually increases with theaddition of the alkaline stabilization reagents. Thus, conventional cementitiousand pozzolanic stabilization processes (all of which involve alkaline materials)are not considered BDAT for wastes containing concentrations above 2% totalmercury. No data have been received on K106 stabilization using proprietary binderssuch as asphalts, silicates, or sulfide. While some vendors have expressedtheir interest in submitting data to EPA, these data have not been submittedat the time of this rule. If these data become available, anyone interestedin reviewing performance data for the stabilization of K106 wastes (mercurysulfides), must request such data following the procedures described insection III.A.1.i. of today's preamble. This request should be identifiedas ``III.A.5.g. Stabilization of Mercury Wastes''. <T3>(d) Incineration.</T3> EPA has information from a few facilities thatindicate routine incineration of some wastes containing organo-metallics.EPA believes that these include organo-mercury wastes such as spent organo-mercurycatalysts, organo-mercurials in lab packs, and paint sludges containingmercury. Thus, incineration is considered to be demonstrated to treat avast array of mercury-containing wastes. The mercury from these wastesis not destroyed by the incineration process but rather accumulates asinorganic mercury compounds in the ash, the scrubber water, and the wastewatertreatment sludges from the treatment of the scrubber waters. Thus, theAgency is specifying further treatment of incineration residues in orderto reduce the mobility or concentration of mercury to levels that morefully minimize threats to human health and the environment. <T3>(2) Complications of Co-disposal with Alkaline Materials.</T3> Mercurysulfide is relatively insoluble in water under acid conditions. However,the information on the attempted pozzolanic stabilization of K106 (whichis primarily mercury sulfide) indicates that the leachability (i.e., solubility)of the mercury increases under alkaline conditions. Therefore, the lowsolubility of mercury sulfide must be balanced against the potential forleachability of the resulting wastewater treatment sludges during co-disposalwith alkaline wastes or materials. This potential for increased leachabilityunder these conditions is a legitimate concern, in that some operatorsof hazardous landfills co-dispose all ``metal'' wastes and it is typicalpractice to add excess lime to prevent migration of the other metals priorto disposal. The Agency solicits comment on whether it should establish disposal requirementsunder 40 CFR parts 264 and 265 for all mercury sulfide wastewater treatmentresiduals in the Low Mercury Subcategory which would require segregationof the treatment residuals from alkaline materials (in either monofillsor separate subcells within a landfill). Such a requirement would be atype of management standard designed to prevent co-disposal of incompatiblewastes. By soliciting comment, EPA notes that these proposed requirementsmay be promulgated as additional requirements to meeting the proposed concentration-basedTCLP standards. The Agency also solicits comment on an alternative of simply classifyingD009, K071, K106, P065, P092, and U151 nonwastewaters in the Low MercurySubcategory as ``incompatible'' with alkaline wastes like hydroxide sludges.The basis would be the increased potential for leachability of the mercurywhen exposed to alkaline pH. <T3>(3) Standards for All Wastewaters.</T3> The Agency has identified ionexchange, carbon disulfide sorption, chemical oxidation/reduction, chemicalprecipitation, or combinations of these technologies as applicable technologiesto treat inorganic mercury wastewaters. Chemical oxidation/reduction processestypically alter the chemical valence of mercury species for subsequentprecipitation or removal by ion exchange or carbon disulfide sorption.While ion exchange and carbon disulfide sorption may be used directly ona mercury-containing wastewater, all of the mercury must be in the propervalence state. Typically these two removal technologies are used primarilyas polishing steps after precipitation. Several facilities are believedto be treating mercury wastewaters with ion exchange or carbon disulfidesorption. However, the Agency lacks sufficient wastewater treatment databased on the use of these two technologies. The Agency has data on precipitation of mercury from wastewaters identifiedas K071 from the chlor-alkali industry using sulfide as the precipitant.The Agency believes that these data represent a matrix that is difficultto treat since it consists of a mixture of different forms of inorganicmercury. The data show that this precipitation process provides effectivetreatment and removal of mercury from these wastewaters because it reducesthe concentration of mercury in the wastewater to levels below the characteristiclevel of 0.2 mg/l. Based on these treatment data, the Agency is proposing a treatment standardof 0.030 mg/l mercury for all D009 wastewaters. The Agency believes thatthese wastes represent the most difficult to treat wastewaters. As discussedin detail in section III.C. of today's preamble, the Agency has initiallydetermined that it has the authority to establish treatment standards belowthe characteristic level for these wastes or at least to make failure totreat to the lower level a violation of section 3004(m). The Agency isalso proposing a second option of limiting the treatment standard for D009wastewaters to the characteristic level of 0.2 mg/l. The Agency specificallysolicits comments on these two options.The Agency is also proposing to transfer these performance data and standardsto K106, P065, P092, and U151 wastewaters. EPA is soliciting and data onthe achievability of these standards for all mercury wastewaters. In particular,the Agency solicits data characterizing the untreated and treated mercury-contaminatedwastewaters that are routinely generated, information pertinent to thedesign and operation of their wastewater treatment technologies, and informationpertinent to the manufacturing processes generating these mercury-bearingwastewaters.Some mercury-containing wastewaters may require more extensive treatmenttrains in order to treat hexavalent chromium, other metals, and organicswhich could possibly interfere with the treatment of the mercury. A reductionstep for hexavalent chromium and an oxidation step (with reagents suchas hydrogen peroxide or hypochlorite) may be necessary to treat the organics.In addition, complexed organometallics which may be present will probablyhave to be oxidized or otherwise removed prior to conversion of the mercuryto their proper valence state for further metal treatment by precipitation.However, the Agency currently lacks reliable data that indicate that theproposed concentration-based standards cannot be achieved for these typesof wastes. Nevertheless, EPA anticipates that pretreatment steps such ashexavalent chromium reduction and chemical oxidation of organics may benecessary and these pretreatment steps could remove these potential interferences.This is further supported by the fact that quantitative analytical methodsfor mercury in waste samples include such pretreatment steps to removethe interferences during analysis. The Agency specifically solicits commentson the applicability of these and other pretreatment technologies for mercury-containingwastewaters and data that indicate the achievability of the proposed wastewaterstandard. <T3>(4) Standards for K106 and U151 Nonwastewaters.</T3> The Agency previouslyproposed treatment standards for K106 wastes based on retorting in theFirst Third proposed rule (53 FR 17578, May 17, 1988). The proposed standards,however, were not promulgated because, at that time, there was insufficientinformation to support the transfer from the retorting of mercury sulfideores or other mercury wastes that the Agency believed were similar to theK106 wastes (53 FR 31173-31174, August 17, 1988). The Agency has sincecollected performance data on the thermal processing of cinnabar ores thatthe Agency believes simulates the roasting/retorting of mercury sulfidecontaining wastes. (See section III.A.5.g.(1.)(a.) above). The Agency is proposing to establish a High Mercury Subcategory and a LowMercury Subcategory for K106 and U151 nonwastewaters based on a cut-offof 16 mg/kg. For wastes in the High Mercury Subcategory (i.e., containinggreater than or equal to 16 mg/kg total mercury) the Agency is proposinga treatment standard of ``Roasting or Retorting as a Method of Treatment''.Since it is likely that K106 and U151 wastes will be considered indigenousto the thermal recovery processes, the residues from these processes wouldno longer be considered K106 or U151. However, if these wastes are EP toxicfor mercury (D009) they must then comply with the appropriate standardsfor D009 wastes (i.e., High or Low Mercury Subcategory) presented below. For K106 and U151 nonwastewaters in the Low Mercury Subcategory (i.e.,less than 16 mg/kg total mercury) the Agency is proposing a treatment standardof 0.025 mg/l mercury measured in a TCLP leachate based on the transferof performance of acid leaching data for K071 nonwastewaters. (See sectionIII.A.5.g.(1.)(b.) above.) Residues from this acid leaching process mustbe evaluated for mercury content to determine whether they must undergothermal recovery. K106 and U151 nonwastewaters that contain less than 16mg/kg total mercury and that also leach less than 0.025 mg/l mercury (asmeasured in the TCLP extract) are considered to have met the BDAT and canbe land disposed. <T3>(5) Proposed Revisions of K071 Nonwastewaters. </T3>The Agency promulgatedtreatment standards for K071 nonwastewaters with the First Third FinalRule based on the performance of a treatment process involving an acidleaching to solubilize and extract the mercury contained in the K071 brinesludge and later convert the mercury to a relatively insoluble mercurysulfide sludge. (See further discussion of proposed rule for K071 in 53FR 11758-11759 (April 8, 1988) and final rule in 53 FR 31166-31167 (August17, 1988).) The Agency is proposing to create a new subcategory identified as K071High Mercury Subcategory and is thus proposing to partially replace theK071 nonwastewater treatment standard previously promulgated. Thus, forK071 nonwastewaters in the High Mercury Subcategory (i.e., greater thanor equal to 16 mg/kg total mercury) the Agency is proposing a treatmentstandard of ``Roasting or Retorting as a Method of Treatment''. (See alsodiscussion for K106 and U151.) The Agency is also proposing to create anew subcategory identified as Low Mercury Subcategory, i.e., less than16 mg/kg total mercury, for K071 nonwastewaters and is retaining the promulgatedstandard (0.025 mg/l mercury based on analysis of a TCLP extract) for thesewastes. <T3>(6) Standards for P065 and P092 Nonwastewaters. </T3>Mercury fulminate(P065) and phenylmercury acetate (P092) are mercury compounds containingcarbon. The Agency has determined that incineration represents part ofthe BDAT for P065 and P092 nonwastewaters. This is because incinerationis demonstrated for destruction of carbon-metal bonds in organo-metallics,and may be necessary to make mercury available for recovery. (See discussionof incineration in section III.A.5.g.(1.)(a.) and (c.) above.) Also, theAgency notes that available information for P065 indicates that mercuryfulminate can be destroyed in an incinerator designed to destroy explosivewastes. (Detailed information on the treatment methods identified for mercuryfulminate can be found in the Department of the Army Technical Manual,TM-9-1300-214, Military Explosive, September 1984). lncineration of P065 and P092 will not destroy mercury, which will endup in the residues. The residues therefore must be treated further. Thisis reflected in the proposed standard for these wastes: ``Incinerationfollowed by roasting or retorting of incinerator nonwastewater residues(ash and wastewater treatment sludges from the treatment of incineratorscrubber waters) provided such residues exceed 16 mg/kg total mercury;and scrubber waters from incineration must comply with the 0.030 mg/l wastewaterstandard'' for D009, K106, P065, P092, and U151 wastewaters. In other words, residues from incinerating these wastes (including wastewatertreatment sludges from the treatment of scrubber waters) require furthertreatment for mercury. For nonwastewaters, if the residues contain sufficientmercury to warrant recovery (16 mg/kg total mercury) they would have tobe roasted or retorted. If not, they would have to meet the standard forlow mercury wastes. Scrubber waters would be required to meet the samestandard applicable to all wastewaters within the mercury treatabilitygroup. Thus, for these wastes, incineration serves as a type of pretreatment,and nonwastewaters from incineration are then evaluated to determine ifthey are in the High or Low Mercury Subcategory, and the appropriate treatmentstandard for mercury applies. <T3>(7) Standards for D009 Nonwastewaters. </T3>Treatment standards forD009 nonwastewaters in the High Mercury Subcategory are being proposedbased on a combination of the standard for K106 and that for P065 and P092.The main reason for this is that D009 wastes may be contaminated with organicsor other organo-mercury constituents (along with inorganic mercury). EPAis thus proposing a standard for D009 nonwastewaters in the High MercurySubcategory of ``Roasting or retorting as a method of treatment; or incinerationfollowed by roasting or retorting of incinerator nonwastewater residues(ash and wastewater treatment sludges from the treatment of incineratorscrubber waters) provided such residues exceed l6 mg/kg total mercury''.As a result, if the organic content is too high for the retorting or roasting,incineration would be required as a pretreatment step. The Agency consideredproposing a subcategory of organic-mercury wastes; however, the Agencyhad no means of establishing a definition for these wastes. Thus, the Agencyis soliciting data and comment that would assist the Agency is subdividingthis standard according to the organic content. <T3>(8) Standards for Radioactive Wastes Containing Mercury.</T3> Informationprovided recently to EPA by the United States Department of Energy (DOE)indicates the generation of two particular mixed radioactive/hazardouswastes that contain mercury. This information also suggests that the BDATtechnologies and standards proposed for the corresponding nonradioactivewastes may not be applicable. The Agency, therefore, has developed alternativetreatment standards for these wastes which are presented in the followingsection.<T3>(a) Elemental Mercury.</T3> Elemental mercury is typically found invacuum pumps and related manometers. In the nuclear industry, this formof mercury has been contaminated with radioactive tritium (a radio-isotopeof hydrogen). These wastes are often identified as D009 or U151. The treatmentstandard proposed for the nonradioactive wastes of this type is ``Roastingor Retorting as a Method of Treatment''. However, the Agency has no dataor information that would indicate that these processes would be able toseparate the mercury from the radioactive material (i.e., tritium) resultingin a reusable mercury. Thus, the Agency believes that these processes wouldnot necessarily be applicable to these wastes and therefore developed aproposed standard based on the following information.As a result of the high vapor pressure associated with elemental mercuryin the liquid form, the predominant safety concern with the mercury inthese wastes is from air emissions. One method that has been developedto handle spills of nonradioactive liquid mercury involves the applicationof elemental zinc powder to areas that have been contaminated with themercury (the visible droplets of liquid mercury are physically collectedin a separate step before application of the zinc). The zinc is dampenedwith dilute sulfuric acid (5-10%) until a paste is formed. This paste isthen collected for disposal. The mercury forms an amalgam with the zincproviding a significant reduction in air emissions of mercury. (EPA prefersthis procedure over the conventional spill cleanup procedures involvingaddition of calcium polysulfide or flowers of sulfur because use of zincresults in lower air emissions of mercury.)The Agency currently has no information on whether this procedure willreduce the overall leachability of mercury. However, the Agency has determinedthat this procedure does provide significant treatment due to the decreasein air emissions, the change in mobility from liquid mercury to a paste-likesolid, and the potential reduction in leachability due to the amalgamationwith the zinc. Based on this information, the general lack of treatmentdata, the lack of alternative technologies, and the unique handling problemsassociated with the radioactivity, the Agency is proposing a treatmentstandard for D009 and U151 elemental mercury wastes contaminated with radioactivematerials of ``Amalgamation with Zinc as a Method of Treatment''. Roasting,retorting or other recovery process are not precluded from use by thisstandard as long as all residuals from these recovery processes complywith the amalgamation treatment standard prior to land disposal.<T3>(b) Hydraulic Oil Contaminated with Mercury. </T3>The DOE also indicatedthe generation of a hydraulic oil that is contaminated with mercury andtritium. EPA is assuming that the hydraulic oil referred to by DOE is organicand can be incinerated. EPA has determined that the technologies applicableto nonradioactive mercury wastes that contain high levels of organics areincineration followed by roasting or retorting of all of the inorganicresidues and wastewater treatment for the scrubber waters. (See the exactproposed standards for P065 and P092 nonwastewaters above.)The Agency is proposing to modify this standard for this type of radioactivemercury waste by removing the requirement to recover mercury from the inorganicresidues. Because the Agency is uncertain that roasting or retorting willbe able to recover a reusable mercury (i.e., nonradioactive) from theseresidues, the Agency is proposing a treatment standard of ``Incinerationas a Method of Treatment with incinerator residues meeting the following:(1) Ash and wastewater treatment sludges from the treatment of scrubberwaters must comply with a TCLP concentration of 0.025 mg/l; and (2) Scrubberwaters must comply with a total concentration of 0.030 mg/l wastewaterstandard'' for D009 Hydraulic Oil Contaminated with Radioactive Materials.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D009, K106, P065, P092, <T4>and </T4>U151<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>0.030</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,4),s25</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K106 <T4>and </T4>U151<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[High Mercury Subcategory_Greater than or equal to 16 mg/kg totalmercury]</ITAG><H1>Roasting or Retorting as a Method of Treatment</H1> <ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K106 <T4>and </T4>U151<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Low Mercury Subcategory_Less than 16 mg/kg total mercury]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>0.025</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,4),s25</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> K071*<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[High Mercury Subcategory_Greater than or equal to 16 mg/kg totalmercury]</ITAG><H1>Roasting or Retorting as a Method of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><F>* This standard creates a new subcategory identified as K071 High MercurySubcategory and would replace the K071 nonwastewater treatment standardpromulgated August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31167) for wastes that would now fallinto this new subcategory.</F></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> K071*<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Low Mercury Subcategory_Less than 16 mg/kg total mercury]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>0.025</D><F>* This standard is the same as the standard for K071 nonwastewaterspromulgated August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31167), but now would only be applicableto the new subcategory identified as the K071 Low Mercury Subcategory.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,4),s25</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> P064 <T4>and </T4>P092<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Incineration Followed by Roasting or Retorting of Incinerator NonwastewaterResidues (Ash and Wastewater Treatment Sludges from Treatment of the IncineratorScrubber Waters) Provided Such Residues Exceed 16 mg/kg Total Mercury;and Scrubber Waters from Incineration Must Comply With the 0.030 mg/l WastewaterStandard</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,4),s25</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> D009<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[High Mercury Subcategory_Greater than or equal to 16 mg/kg totalmercury]</ITAG><H1>Roasting or Retorting as a Method of Treatment; or Incineration Followedby Roasting or Retorting of Incinerator Nonwastewater Residues (Ash andWastewater Treatment Sludges from Treatment of the Incinerator ScrubberWaters) Provided Such Residues Exceed 16 mg/kg Total Mercury</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> D009<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Low Mercury Subcategory_Less than 16 mg/kg total mercury]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury <D>0.025</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,4),s25</C>BDAT <T4>Treatment Standards for</T4> D009 <T4>and</T4> U151 <T4>Elemental Mercury Contaminated With Radioactive Materials</T4><H1>Amalgamation with Zinc as a Method of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,4),s25</C>BDAT <T4>Treatment Standards for</T4> D009 <T4>Hydraulic Oil Contaminated with Mercury and Radioactive Materials</T4><H1>Incineration as a Method of Treatment with Incinerator Residues Meetingthe Following: (1) Ash and Wastewater Treatment Sludges from Treatmentof the Incinerator Scrubber Waters Must Comply with a TCLP Concentrationof 0.025 mg/l; and (2) Scrubber Waters must Comply with a Total Concentrationof 0.030 mg/l Wastewater Standard)</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><T3>h. Silver. </T3>The Agency has identified three hazardous wastes thatpotentially contain high levels of silver. These include P099 (potassiumsilver cyanide), P104 (silver cyanide), and D011 (EP toxic for silver;5.0 mg/l silver as measured in an EP leachate). Treatment standards forcyanides contained in P099 and P104 wastes were promulgated with the FinalRule for Second Third Wastes (54 FR 26614 (June 23, 1989)). At the sametime, treatment standards for silver in P099 and P104 wastewaters werenot promulgated based on the lack of treatment data. Today's notice proposestreatment standards for P099 and P104 wastewaters and all D011 wastes.Silver is part of the Group I elements and has chemical properties similarto lead and mercury. In aqueous conditions silver typically exists as amonovalent, cationic species. This behavior is important, in that selectionand performance of treatment technologies for silver is somewhat similarto most other metals based on this cationic behavior in aqueous conditions.However, due to differences in solubilities of certain salts of silvercompared to other metals, treatment technologies for both wastewaters andnonwastewaters containing silver are slightly different compared to wastescontaining only other metal constituents. The treatment standards presented in today's preamble for all silver wastesare based on a limited amount of treatment data. In this notice, the Agencyis soliciting data on the characterization and treatment of all wastescontaining silver. Copies of any additional data pertaining to these proposedtreatment standards that may be submitted during the public comment period,can be specifically requested in writing by identifying the request fordata as ``additional data on treatment of silver_section III.A.5.h.''.See section III.A.1.i. of today's preamble for additional information onprocedures for requesting additional data on specific standards. <T3>(1) Identification of BDAT for Wastewaters. </T3>When evaluating treatmenttechnologies to establish wastewater treatment standards for silver wastes,the Agency believes that it must consider not only the efficiency of removalof silver from the wastewater, but also the physical and chemical stateof the precipitated silver salts that end up in the wastewater treatmentresidues. Some data indicate that silver can be removed from wastewaters by usinglime (calcium hydroxide) or caustic (sodium hydroxide) as a precipitatingreagent (resulting in precipitation of the silver as a hydroxide salt (silverhydroxide)). However, silver is typically precipitated as a chloride salt(silver chloride) using a soluble chloride salt as a precipitating reagent.Most other cationic metals are typically removed from wastewaters basedon precipitation as hydroxides, carbonates or sulfides. While silver hydroxideis slightly soluble in water, silver chloride is relatively insoluble inwater. Although lime or caustic may be effective in precipitating silverfrom wastewaters, chloride precipitation should result in a precipitatethat is less soluble in water than the hydroxide salt. Due to the relatively higher solubility of silver hydroxide (compared tosilver chloride), there exists a reasonable potential for an increase inleachability of silver from the resulting wastewater treatment sludge containingsilver as a chloride during co-disposal with alkaline wastes or materials.This potential for increased leachability under these conditions is a legitimateconcern, in that some operators of hazardous landfills co-dispose all ``metal''wastes and it is typical practice to add excess lime to prevent migrationof the other metals prior to disposal. Thus, EPA solicits comments on whether it should (as part of the treatmentstandard) specify the use of chloride as the precipitating reagent forall wastewaters containing silver. In a similar manner, the Agency solicitscomment on whether it should establish disposal requirements under 40 CFRparts 264 and 265 for all silver wastewaters that would include chlorideprecipitation followed by segregation of the treatment residuals from alkalinematerials (i.e., in either monofills or separate subcells within a landfill).In doing so, EPA notes these proposed requirements may then be promulgatedas additional requirements to meeting the proposed concentration-basedstandards. The Agency has information that sulfide has been used to precipitate silvercontained in photoprocessing wastewaters. Also, ion exchange of silverhas been reported as achieving extremely high removal efficiencies. TheAgency is soliciting data on the efficiency of these treatment technologiesfor D011 wastes. For some silver wastewaters more extensive treatment trains may be necessaryin order to treat hexavalent chromium, other metals, and organics whichcould possibly interfere with the treatment of the silver. A reductionstep for hexavalent chromium and an oxidation step (with reagents suchas hydrogen peroxide or hypochlorite) may be necessary to treat the organics.However, the Agency currently lacks data that indicate that the proposedconcentration-based standards cannot be achieved for these type of wastesand anticipates that pretreatment steps such as hexavalent chromium reductionand chemical oxidation of organics could remove these potential interferences.The Agency specifically solicits comments on the applicability of theseand other pretreatment technologies for silver wastewaters and data thatindicate the achievability of the concentration-based standards proposedin the following sections. The Agency has very little data on precipitation of silver from RCRA hazardouswastewaters identified as P099, P104, or D011. However, the Agency's doeshave data from its analysis of various treated wastewaters under the Agency'sEffluent Guideline Program. In the absence of treatment data specific toP099, P104, or D011 wastewaters, the Agency believes that these data fromthe Effluent Guidelines Program can be transferred to develop treatmentstandards for P099, P104, or D011 wastewaters. The data show that the treatmentprovided by these industries can reduce the concentration of silver inthe wastewater of levels below the characteristic level of 5.0 mg/l. Therefore, the Agency is proposing two options for treatment standardsfor D011 wastewaters. Based on these treatment data, the Agency is proposinga treatment standard of 0.29 mg/l silver for all D011 wastewaters as oneoption. As discussed in detail in section III.C. of today's preamble, theAgency has initially determined that it has the authority to establishtreatment standards below the characteristic level for these wastes orat least to make failure to treat to the lower level a violation of section3004(m). The Agency is also proposing a second option of limiting the treatmentstandard for D011 wastewaters to the characteristic level of 5.0 mg/l.The Agency specifically solicits comments on these two options. Based on this same data, the Agency is also proposing a treatment standardfor silver in P099 and P104 wastewaters of 0.29 mg/l of silver. While P099(potassium silver cyanide) and P104 (silver cyanide) wastes are typicallygenerated as nonwastewaters, the Agency expects that wastewater forms ofthese wastes may be generated from incidental spills or from the treatmentprocess itself and thus would require treatment standards. The Agency expectsthat untreated wastewaters will be relatively dilute, and thus would notbe expected to be difficult to treat. The Agency points out that it isnot recpening the promulgated treatment standards for cyanides in P099and P104 for comment. <T3>(2) Identification of BDAT for Nonwastewaters.</T3> The Agency is proposingseveral options for treatment standards for D011 nonwastewaters. Theseoptions are based on the inherent economic value of silver and the generallack of treatment data for wastes containing various levels of silver.For nonwastewater forms of D011, the Agency believes that the silver canbe dissolved or leached using an appropriate media (each chemical formof silver may require a different dissolving media) and either reprecipitatedas the chloride or hydroxide or better yet, recovered for its inherenteconomic value through processes involving electro-deposition or electro-winning.As an example, while silver chloride is generally insoluble in dilute acids,it is considerably soluble in strong ammonia (NH<T2>4</T2>OH) and could theoretically be leached by ammonia and recovered.The Agency believes that due to the relatively high economic value of silver,an economic incentive already exists for most generators to investigateall recovery options as well as source reduction techniques to preventgeneration. The Agency is thus proposing one option for D011 nonwastewaterstreatment standards as ``Recovery as a Method of Treatment''. However, the Agency does not think that at very low concentrations (i.e.,just above the EP level) and low waste volumes, recovery may not be a viablealternative for D011 wastes. Therefore, the Agency investigated the availabilityof stabilization data for wastes containing silver. Treatment standardsfor silver in nonwastewater forms of P099 and PI04 were promulgated inthe Second Third Rule (53 FR 26615, (June, 23, 1989)). These standardswere transferred from stabilization data for F006 nonwastewaters. However,these data represent the stabilization of a waste that originally containedlow concentrations of silver. The Agency received no comments disputingthe achievability of the silver standards for P099 and P104 wastes, eventhough the Agency anticipates that these wastes could contain reasonablyhigh levels of silver. As a result, the Agency is proposing the same concentration-basedstandards for silver in D011 nonwastewaters. However, the Agency is concernedabout the validity of the transfer of these standards to D011 wastes thatcontain high levels of silver, and is thus proposing ``Recovery or Stabilizationas Methods of Treatment''. EPA is currently unaware of any silver wastes contaminated with high levelsof organics being generated on a routine basis. If these wastes do exist,the Agency believes that these wastes can be incinerated prior to stabilizationof the ash. The Agency is soliciting information on whether these wastesactually exist, the concentration of silver and organics within these wastes,and treatment data for these wastes. If the Agency finds that these wastesdo exist and treatment data is submitted, the Agency may define these wastesas a separate treatability group based on the level of organics and silverand promulgate the resultant concentration-based standards based on thesedata. However, information is submitted that these wastes exist but notreatment data are submitted from which concentration-based standards canbe developed, the Agency may promulgate ``Incineration Followed by Stabilizationas a Method of Treatment'' for these wastes. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> D011, P099, <T4>and </T4>P104<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any 24 hour composite sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D>0.29</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>D011 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, TCLP (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D>0.072</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>i.

The Agency has been able to identify only one manufacturer of Thalliumwastes. (In fact, the Bureau of Mines estimates the production of thalliumas only 4,000 pounds per year.) Most of thallium compounds are used inresearch, in the electrical industry for the production of thallium activatedsodium iodide crystals, in the glass industry as low melting alloys, andas catalysts in the organic chemical industry.<T3>(1) Wastewaters.</T3> The Agency has reviewed characterization datafrom the Generator Survey and the TSDR Survey for thallium wastewaters.Based on the information from these surveys, most thallium wastewatersare characterized as metallic acidic liquids. There may be other metalssuch as lead, nickel, and zinc present within the wastes. The concentrationof thallium in these wastes range from 0.1-10 ppm.The Agency has information indicating that thallic hydroxide compoundsare very insoluble. The Agency is proposing to use this information toextrapolate treatment standards to these thallium wastes. The Agency believesthat because thallic hydroxide is so insoluble, if these thallium wastesare treated by chemical oxidation followed by chemical precipitation withhydroxide reagents, settling and filtration, most of the thallic compoundswill precipitate out in the sludge. Therefore, BDAT for thallium wastewatersis chemical oxidation followed by chemical precipitation with hydroxidereagents, settling and filtering. The treatment standard being proposedtoday is based on the detection limit of thallium in wastewaters.As an alternative, the Agency has recently analyzed additional wastewatertreatment data primarily from the Agency's Office of Water for incorporationinto the treatment standards for many of the U and P wastes in this section.These data include the treatment of wastewaters that are not specificallylisted as U or P wastewaters, but do contain many metal constituents. Whilethese data were not available in time to incorporate into this discussionor into the background document for these wastes, these data are beingplaced in the administrative record for today's notice. Therefore, theAgency is not precluded from using these data in promulgating the standardsfor these wastes. Further information on these data can be found in sectionIII.A.1.h.(6.). The resultant alternative standard calculated for thalliumin wastewaters is 1.400 mg/l.<T3>(2) Nonwastewaters.</T3> The Agency is proposing several options fortreatment standards for P113, P114, P115, U214, U215, U216, and U217 nonwastewaters.These options are based on the inherent economic value of thallium andthe general lack of treatment data for wastes containing various levelsof thallium.Based on information from the Generator Survey, most of the thallium nonwastewatersare characterized as inorganic salts used as research chemicals, off-specification,or out-dated materials. Because of the insolubility of thallic hydroxidecompounds and the information that suggest that these thallium compoundsare mostly inorganic, the Agency believes that P113, P114, P115, U214,U215, U216, and U217 nonwastewaters are also primarily inorganic and thereforecan be stabilized. Thus, the Agency is proposing that stabilization isalso BDAT for the nonwastewaters. In addition, the Agency believes thatdue to the relatively high economic value of thallium, an economic incentivealready exists for most generators to investigate all recovery optionsas well as source reduction techniques to prevent generation. However,the Agency does not think that at very low concentrations and low wastevolumes, recovery may not be a viable alternative for thallium wastes.The Agency is thus proposing for a nonwastewater treatment standard of``Recovery or Stabilization as a Method of Treatment'' for P113, P114,P115, U214, U215, U216, and U217. The Agency is also soliciting comments on the regulation of P114 (thalliumselenite). In section III.A.5.b. of today's rule, the Agency is proposinga concentration-based treatment standard for D010 nonwastewaters basedon vitrification data for arsenic. Thus, the Agency is proposing ``Vitrification<T3>or</T3> Stabilization as a Method of Treatment'' for P114 nonwastewatersand is soliciting comments on whether vitrification is necessary to immobilizeboth thallium and selenium.

Vanadium.</T3><ITAG tagnum="25">P119_Ammonium vanadate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">P120_Vanadium pentoxide</ITAG>Vanadium compounds are used primarily as alloying materials in iron andsteel production or as catalysts in several chemical manufacturing processessuch as adipic acid, sulfuric acid, synthetic rubber, and crude oil. Mostof the vanadium produced in the United States comes from mined ores orrecovery processes. Vanadium is recovered from mining ores by calciningand leaching of the calcined material. Recovery processes usually recoverthe vanadium in its pentoxide state. Vanadium is recovered in uranium productionvia liquid/liquid extraction; and the product is usually in the form ofammonium metavanadate. The Agency believes that these wastes comprise one treatability group becausethey are produced from the same mined ores and are used as catalysts insimilar industries. Vanadium wastes such as P119 and P120, can be generatedas a fly ash or slag from the iron and steel industry or as a spent catalystfrom the chemical manufacturing process. Based on information from theGenerators Survey, these wastes could be classified as inorganic solids,organic liquids, or used bags or drums. <T3>(1) Wastewaters. </T3>The Agency believes that P119 and P120 wastewaterscould be generated from recovery or incineration of the nonwastewater formsof P119 and P120, and as leachate from landfill closure operations. A reviewof the literature indicates that vanadium compounds can be treated withferric sulfate. By treating with ferric sulfate, the vanadium is removedfrom the wastewaters and ferric metavanadate, which is relatively insoluble,remains in the filter cake. The Agency has recently analyzed additional wastewater treatment data primarilyfrom the Agency's Office of Water for incorporation into the treatmentstandards for many of the metal wastes in this section. These data includethe treatment of wastewaters that are not specifically listed as P119 orP120 wastewaters, but do contain many metal constituents. While these datawere not available in time to incorporate into this discussion or intothe background document for these wastes, these data are being placed inthe administrative record for today's notice. Therefore, the Agency isnot precluded from using these data in promulgating the standards for thesewastes. Further information on these data can be found in section III.A.1.h.(6.).The resultant alternative standard calculated for vanadium in wastewatersis 0.042 mg/1. <T3>(2) Nonwastewaters.</T3> The Agency believes that P119 and P120 nonwastewaterscan be generated as spent catalysts from chemical production or as flyash from the iron and steel industry. The Agency has information indicatingthat nonwastewaters containing greater than seven percent of vanadium canbe recovered. The Agency is proposing a treatment standard for P119 andP120 nonwastewaters of ``Thermal Recovery as a Method of Treatment'' basedon the following: (1) P119 and P120 are generated primarily as off-specproducts and would probably contain greater than seven percent vanadiumdue to their elemental composition, thus making them technically viableto recovery; (2) Due to these high levels of vanadium, P119 and P120 containan inherent high economic value that acts as an incentive for most generatorsto investigate all recovery options as well as source reduction techniquesto prevent generation; and (3) The Agency has no other treatment data fornonwastewaters containing vanadium.However, the Agency does not think that at very low concentrations andlow waste volumes, recovery may not be a viable alternative for vanadiumwastes. Because these vanadium compounds are inorganic, the Agency believesthat P119 and P120 nonwastewaters could be easily stabilized. Thus, theAgency is also proposing that stabilization is BDAT for the nonwastewaters.The Agency is thus proposing a treatment standard of ``Recovery of Stabilizationas a Method of Treatment'' for P119 and P120 nonwastewaters. The Agencyis soliciting comments on potential cut-off levels for vanadium wastesthat can be recovered versus those that can be stabilized and any stabilizationdata on wastes containing vanadium.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> P119<T4> and</T4> P120<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any 24 hour composite sample</H1><H2> Total Composition (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Vanadium<D>0.042</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,04),s25</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> P119 <T4>and</T4> P120 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Thermal Recovery or Stabilization as a Method of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22">_</ITAG></ITAG><T3>6. Proposed Treatment Standards for Additional Waste Code SpecificTreatability Groups._a. Cyanide Wastes.</T3> In the June 23, 1989 SecondThird final rule, the Agency promulgated treatment standards for amenableand total cyanide constituents for the electroplating, heat treating, andacrylonitrile F and K wastes (54 FR 26610-615). The Agency transferredcertain of these treatment standards to the cyanide wastes listed as Pwaste codes. The analytical method used to measure cyanide concentrationsin treatment residues (thereby determining compliance with the treatmentstandard) was SW-846 Method 9010. After promulgation of the Second Third rule, the National Associationof Metal Finishers (NAMF) requested that the Agency confirm that generatorsof F006 nonwastewaters containing cyanides will be in compliance with theSecond Third Land Disposal Restrictions if the total cyanide treatmentstandard (590 mg/kg) is measured using Method 9010 as currently written,that is analyzing the largest sample size practical, distilling for approximatelyone (1) hour, and one (1) liter distillation flask. NAMF asserted thatfor certain F006 nonwastewaters the total cyanide concentration variedsignificantly depending on the length of distillation time and the samplesize used for the analysis. Data submitted by NAMF indicated that as thesample size increased and distillation time decreased, the concentrationof total cyanide increased. EPA regards the lack of specificity as to the sample size and distillationtime in the description of Method 9010 to be potential loopholes that couldallow persons to misuse the analytical method in order to demonstrate compliancewithout treating the waste. The Agency believes that a generator or treatercould analyze a large sample size (i.e., greater than 10 grams) and shortenthe length of the distillation time_thereby impacting the amount of cyanidesthat ultimately is analyzed_in order to comply with the treatment standard.Most of the samples being analyzed for cyanides are treatment residuescontaining significant amounts of alkaline materials, such as lime andmetal hydroxides. The analytic method uses a fixed amount of sulfuric acid(as specified in Method 9010) which amount is supposed to be sufficientto neutralize alkaline materials and to acidify the sample such that thecyanide is converted to HCN and subsequently distilled and analyzed astotal cyanide. However, the method does not limit the sample size nor thedistillation time, and too large of a sample size could result in incompleteneutralization of the alkalinity, thus reducing the amount of HCN releasedand a resultant lower analysis of total cyanide. Similarly, too short adistillation time would also result in a lower analysis of total cyanide.To prevent this from happening, EPA is proposing an amendment to 40 CFR268.43 that would require amenable and total cyanide concentration in wastesto be analyzed by Method 9010 of SW-846 with a sample size and a distillationtime ranging from 0.5 to 10 grams and one hour to one hour and fifteenminutes, respectively. By proposing these constraints on sample size anddistillation time, the Agency believes that compliance of the BDAT treatmentstandard will be done by actual treatment. Also, based on information fromcommercial laboratories, these values represent a range of sample sizeand distillation time that is commonly used for cyanide analysis.EPA does not believe that this proposed clarification to the analyticalmethod affects the achievability of the cyanide standards already promulgated.In fact, the sample size and the distillation time used to develop thetreatment standards for F006, F007, F008, and F009 nonwastewaters were10 grams and one hour and fifteen minutes, respectively (see RCRA DocketLD10-L0032, letter dated May 1, 1989). The Agency subsequently has solicitedinformation from several treaters of cyanide wastes, who indicated to theAgency during the Second Third rulemaking that they were achieving theF006 nonwastewater cyanide standard as to the sample size and distillationtime they are using. These facilities stated that they use a sample sizeof less than 5 grams and a distillation time of 1 hour (see administrativerecord for cyanide wastes in today's notice), again within the range beingproposed today. Therefore, the Agency believes that the data in the SecondThird rule documenting achievability of the cyanide treatment standardreflects the analytic procedure being proposed today.<T3>(1) F006 Wastewaters. </T3>Today's rule proposes wastewater treatmentstandards for amenable and total cyanides and metal constituents for F006wastewaters. (Nonwastewater standards for F006 metal constituents werepromulgated in the First Third final rule, and nonwastewater standardsfor F006 cyanides were promulgated in the Second Third final rule.) Wastewatertreatment standards are based on the performance of alkaline chlorinationfor the amenable and total cyanides, and chromium reduction followed bychemical precipitation using lime and sulfides and sludge dewatering forthe metals. Detailed information on F006 waste characterization and thetechnical feasibility of the transfer of the performance of the treatmentsystems can be found in the Proposed Addendum to the Best DemonstratedAvailable Technology (BDAT) Background Document for F006.F006 wastewaters are expected to result primarily from waste treatmentoperations in the electroplating or metal finishing industries. For example,the filter and/or clarifier overflow from treated electroplating wastewatersmay be considered F006 wastewaters. F006 wastewaters may also be generatedat a CERCLA site, during corrective action at a RCRA facility, or as aresult of spills.The Agency is proposing amenable and total cyanide standards for F006 wastewatersbased on the performance of alkaline chlorination. The Agency is transferringthese standards from the F007, F008, and F009 wastewaters. This transferis based on the similarities in concentrations of cyanides in these wastewatersand on the fact that F006 wastewaters, like F007, F008, and F009 wastewaters,are generated from electroplating operations. The Agency also believesthat the F006 wastewaters contain lower or at most, similar, concentrationsof amenable and total cyanides than F007, F008, and F009 wastewaters andare therefore less difficult to treat.The Agency is proposing four metal standards (cadmium, total chromium,lead, and nickel) for F006 wastewaters based on the transfer of treatmentstandards for metals in K062. These standards are based on chromium reductionfollowed by chemical precipitation using lime and sulfide and sludge dewatering.(In fact, the Agency has information that certain facilities currentlyusing these same treatment processes on F006 wastewaters.) The Agency believesthat this transfer is technically feasible because the metals in K062 wastewatersare more difficult to treat (due to the high acidity of K062 wastes andthe higher overall concentrations of total dissolved salts and metals)than the F006 wastewaters (e.g., individual metal concentrations in K062ranged up to 7,000 ppm).During the process of determining today's proposed standards, the Agencyalso evaluated performance data that were developed by EPA's Office ofWater for hydroxide precipitation, sedimentation, and filtration for wastesfrom the metal finishing industry. However, the Agency did not use thesedata in the development of today's proposed F006 metal standards becausethe metal finishing waste characterization data indicated that the untreatedconcentrations of these metals in these wastewaters were low compared tothose in F006 wastewaters. In fact, the individual metal concentrationsin F006 wastewaters ranged up to 400 ppm and overall were typically ordersof magnitude higher than those in the database for metal finishing rawwastewaters. The Agency believes, therefore, that these treatment datafor the metal finishing wastewater streams do not represent treatment ofF006 wastewaters and may result in wastewater treatment standards thatwould be unachievable for the F006 wastewaters. Thus, the Agency is notproposing F006 wastewater treatment standards based on these data.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F006<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total)<D>1.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable)<D>0.10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>1.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium<D>0.32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>0.040</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>0.44</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>(2) F019.</T3> Today's rule proposes treatment standards for amenableand total cyanides and metals in F019 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. Treatmentstandards for the wastewaters are based on the performance of wet air oxidationfor the amenable and total cyanides. Treatment standards for metals inwastewaters are based on chromium reduction, chemical precipitation withlime and sulfide, and sludge dewatering. Treatment standards for the nonwastewatersare based on the performance of wet air oxidation for amenable and totalcyanides, and stabilization for the metals.In the Second Third final rule, the Agency stated that F019 wastes area different treatability group than F006, F007, F008, and F009 electroplatingwastes or F010, F011, and F012 heat treating wastes. This difference isprimarily due to the presence of high concentrations of iron-cyanide complexes(ferric or ferrous cyanides) in F019 wastes (54 FR 26613, June 23, 1989).The source of the iron-cyanide complexes is the soluble ferrocyanide compoundsused in the coating baths and in components of the coating. A detailedtechnical description of the generation and characterization of F019 wastesand discussion of the applicable technologies can be found in the BackgroundDocument for F019 wastes.For the F019 wastes, the Agency investigated the technologies of ultraviolet(UV) ozonation and wet air oxidation. For the UV ozonation test, the Agencytreated a F009 waste that contained primarily complex cyanides at a concentrationof 60 to 63 ppm. This waste was then spiked with approximately 1,900 ppmof the ferricyanide, in order to simulate an F019 wastewater. The performancedata from the UV ozonation technology indicated that the total cyanideconcentration was not substantially reduced, indicating that UV ozonationwas not an effective treatment for these wastes.The Agency also investigated wet air oxidation of F019 wastes. The originalF019 wastes collected by the Agency contained a total concentration ofcyanide of 5,000 ppm. The waste was then diluted four to one with waterin order to fluidize and charge the waste through the wet air oxidationprocess. Therefore, the theoretical influent concentration of cyanide shouldhave been 1,250 ppm. However, the analysis of the influent concentrationof cyanides indicated a concentration of 300 ppm (which was analyzed asmostly amenable cyanides). Because of these apparent discrepancies in theanalytical data, the Agency is proposing two options for the developmentof treatment standards for total and amenable cyanides for F019 wastewatersand nonwastewaters.The first option proposes concentration-based treatment standards for cyanidesbased on the performance data for wet air oxidation. Although there apparentlyare some discrepancies (noted above) with the cyanide analyses for F019,these data do represent treatment of an F019 waste and indicate that significantdestruction of cyanides was achieved by the technology. Since wet air oxidationis an applicable technology and has been demonstrated on other cyanidewastes, the Agency believes that these standards based on wet air oxidationcan be achieved.As an alternative, the Agency is also proposing to transfer the concentration-basedtreatment standards for F006-F009 based on the performance of alkalinechlorination for F006 through F009 wastes. In the Second Third Final Rule(54 FR 26611), the Agency promulgated a treatment standard for total cyanidein F006 through F009 nonwastewaters as 590 mg/kg. While the Agency statedthat F019 wastes were different from F006-F009 wastes because the F019wastes contained high concentrations of iron-cyanide complexes, reviewof the waste characterization data for F006 wastes indicates that manyF006 wastes also contain high concentrations of iron-cyanide complexesthat are somewhat similar. Based on this information and the fact thatF019 wastes could be diluted to levels similar to those found in the highiron F006 wastes in order to effect treatment, the Agency believes thatthe alternative proposed treatment standards for F019 based on a transferfrom these F006 high iron wastes may be appropriate. The Agency is requestingcomments on these two options for developing treatment standards for F019wastes.In addition, the Agency is proposing a treatment standard for amenablecyanides in F019 nonwastewaters based on the reproducibility of the analyticalmethod for total cyanides. Details of the calculation of the amendablecyanide standards can  be found in the background document. The Agencyused a similar procedure for developing treatment standards for amenablecyanides in F006-F012 wastes in the Second Third Final Rule (see 54 FR26611).The Agency is proposing treatment standards for total chromium based ona transfer of treatment performance data for K062 wastewaters. These dataare from a treatment train that included chromium reduction followed byprecipitation with lime or sulfide and dewatering. In addition, generatorsof F019 wastes have indicated to the Agency that this treatment train isconsistent with the onsite treatment of F019 wastewaters that is currentlybeing performed. The Agency believes that this transfer is technicallyfeasible because the metals in K062 wastewaters are more difficult to treat(due to the high acidity of K062 wastes and the higher overall concentrationsof total dissolved salts and metals) than the F006 wastewaters (e.g., individualmetal concentrations in K062 ranged up to 7000 ppm). The Agency is also proposing treatment standards for total chromium inF019 nonwastewaters based on a transfer of performance data from the stabilizationof F006 wastes. The Agency believes that the transfer of the performanceof stabilization data from F006 to F019 is technically feasible due tothe higher concentration of metals within F006 wastes.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F019<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Total)<D>0.27</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Amendable)<D>0.11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total)<D>0.32</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> F019<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Total)<D>390</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Amendable)<D>20</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,ns,tp0,i1,s25,7.3</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, TCLP (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total)<D>5.2</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>(3) K011, K013 and K014. </T3>In the Second Third final rule, the Agencypromulgated treatment standards for the K011, K013, and K014 nonwastewaters(54 FR 26614, June 23, 1989). Treatment standards for the nonwastewaterswere based on the performance of incineration. In addition, the Agencyproposed treatment standards for K011, K013, and K014 wastewaters in theSecond Third proposed rule on January 11, 1989 (54 FR 1056). Commenterson the proposed wastewater standards indicated that they were in the processof developing wet air oxidation data for these wastewaters. Since the Agencyconcurred that wet air oxidation was an applicable technology for thesewastes and since the other data that was available to the Agency for treatmentof these wastewaters was relatively incomplete, the Agency chose not topromulgate the proposed wastewater treatment standards at that time. Afterthe close of the comment period, commenters submitted these performancedata for treatment of K011, K013, and K014 wastewaters using wet air oxidation.As a result, the Agency is proposing treatment standards for organics andtotal cyanides in K011, K013, and K014 wastewaters. Treatment standardsare based on the performance of wet air oxidation for the organics andcyanides.The Agency is defining K011, K013, and K014 wastewaters (as generated)as containing less than 3.5% Total Organic Content (TOC) and less thanl% Total Suspended Solids (TSS). The Agency believes that the 3.5% cutofflevel is applicable based on the available waste characterization datafor K011, K013, and K014 wastes. As generated all of these wastes are liquidand contain primarily water, yet they sporadically contain over 1% TOC(but not more than 3%) and would have been classified as nonwastewatersbased on the Agency's standard cut-off of 1% TOC.The Agency originally established the 1% TOC cut-off based on evaluationof waste characterization data for solvent-water mixtures. These data indicatedthat the majority (99%) of the wastewaters containing solvents were significantlylower in total organics. These lower concentrations also corresponded tothe appropriate concentrations of feed streams for the technologies applicableto the solvent-water mixtures (i.e., steam stripping, biodegradation, andcarbon adsorption). The proposed 3.5% TOC cutoff for K011, K013, and K014wastewaters is based on similar logic and calculation. In addition, thetechnology of choice for K011, K013, and K014 liquids with less than 3.5%TOC is wet air oxidation. Since wet air oxidation is typically designedto handle similar or slightly higher TOC levels although 10% TOC is citedin guidance as a typical maximum level for wet air oxidation, but, wetair oxidation systems are usually designed for lower levels, the Agencydetermined that it is an appropriate technology for these wastes and thatthe TOC cut-off for K011, K013, and K014 wastewaters should be adjustedaccordingly.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K011, K013, K014<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters andless;3.5% TOC and andless;1% TSS]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Acetonitrile<D>38</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acrylamide<D>19.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acrylonitrile<D>0.06</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene<D>0.02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total)<D>21.</D></ITAG></ITAG>(4) U and P Waste Codes Containing CyanidesP031_CyanogenP033_Cyanogen chlorideU246_Cyanogen bromideToday's rule proposes alkaline chlorination or incineration as a methodof treatment for amenable and total cyanides for P031, P033, and U246 Wastes.For these wastes, the Agency is proposing a technology rather than concentration-basedstandards due to the high toxicity of these wastes and due to the imprecisionof the analytical method for these wastes.In a cyanide oxidation process such as alkaline chlorination, the cyanidepresent within a waste is converted to carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Beforethe carbon dioxide and nitrogen are formed, there are two intermediatereactions that occur. The first reaction is the reaction of cyanide withchlorine to form cyanogen compounds. The second reaction is cyanogen compoundshydrolyzed to cyanate compounds. These cyanate compounds are further oxidizedwith excess chlorine to carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Based on informationfrom the ``Standards Method for the Examination of Wastewater,'' the cyanogencompounds are highly toxic and have limited solubility. At alkaline pH,these compounds hydrolyze to the cyanate compound and the rate of reactionis pH and time dependent. However, these cyanogen compounds convert rapidlyto the cyanate compound when there is excess chlorine.The Agency believes that because the cyanogen compounds are very unstable,these compounds are destroyed by incineration. Since the Agency has datathat indicate that other more stable cyanide wastes can be completely destroyedto the detection limits, the Agency is proposing that incineration is anoption for these cyanogen U and P wastes.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s100</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> P031, P033, U246<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters and Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Alkaline Chlorination or Incineration as Methods of Treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>b. F024 and F025<T3>(1) Addition of Standards for F024 Wastes. </T3>Concentration-basedtreatment standards for organics in F024 wastewater and nonwastewater werepromulgated in the Second Third final rule (54 FR 26615, June 23, 1989).The treatment standards were based on the performance of rotary kiln incinerationfor organic constituents, and chemical precipitation followed by vacuumfiltration for metal constituents in wastewaters.After the close of the comment period, the Agency completed an analysisof TCLP extracts obtained from the stabilization of F024 incinerator ashresidues. The results of this analysis showed substantial reduction ofmetals; however, because these data were not available for public noticeand comment and the resultant treatment standards were significantly differentfrom the proposed standards, the Agency decided to reserve treatment standardsfor metals in F024 nonwastewaters.Stabilization is an available technology for metals in F024 nonwastewatersbecause this technology is commercially available and can be purchasedfrom a proprietor, and provides substantial reduction of metal hazardousconstituents in the TCLP extract. The stabilization data obtained fromthe Agency's BDAT treatment test of F024 incinerator ash residues is theonly available data on treatment of metal constituents in F024 nonwastewaters.EPA therefore considers stabilization to be BDAT for metals in F024 nonwastewaters.The specific constituents being proposed by EPA for regulation and theproposed treatment standards are presented in the table at the end of thissection. For a detailed description of the reductions exhibited by stabilizationof these wastes refer to the Addendum to the BDAT Background Document forF024. EPA has received anecdotal information that some treatment facilities whichpreviously treated F024 wastes are now refusing to do so because the treatmentstandard for the waste includes standards for various chlorinated-dibenzodioxins and furans. EPA has not had the opportunity to pursue whether thisis the case, or the extent of the problem, if any. EPA solicits commenton these points here. In addition, the Agency solicits comment on whetherthe other treatment standards for organics in F024 serve as an adequatesurrogates for these chlorinated-dibenzo dioxins and furans (i.e., whetherachieving the treatment standards for the other organic constituents inthe waste means that the treatment standards for chlorinated-dibenzo dioxinsand furans will also be achieved). Based on these comments, the Agencymay amend the treatment standard for chlorinated-dibenzo dioxins and furansin F024 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. <T3>(2) Proposed Standards for F025 Wastes.</T3> Although the listing ofF025 as a RCRA hazardous waste has not been promulgated as of today's rule,the Agency believes that promulgation of the listing for F025 will occurprior to the promulgation of the Third Third final rule, and has thereforedecided to propose concentration-based treatment standards for F025 wastesat this time. The proposed concentration-based standards for F025, however,may change or become further refined as a result of the final listing ofthe waste. (EPA would not, however, establish an effective date for a prohibitionand treatment standard for this waste before the effective date of theF025 waste listing.) F025 wastes have been characterized as condensed light ends, spent filtersand filter aids, and spent desiccant wastes from the production of chlorinatedaliphatics. For the purposes of establishing treatment standards, the wasteshave been grouped into two subcategories: condensed light ends and filters/aidsand desiccants. Available characterization data suggest that differentconstituents may be contained in each of these subcategories. Therefore,the Agency is proposing concentration-based treatment standards to reflectthese differences in physical and chemical composition. Concentration-basedtreatment standards for all wastewater and nonwastewaters forms of F025are proposed today based of the transfer of performance data used in thedevelopment of treatment standards for specific U and P wastes that areconstituents in the various F025 subcategories. (See sections III.A.2.c.and III.A.2.d. for additional information). The Agency believes that theconstituents expected to be contained in F025 wastes can be incineratedto below detection limits. Those constituents for which the Agency hasnot set concentration-based standards can also be incinerated to belowdetection limits because the Agency believes that these constituents areeasier to treat than those constituents for which EPA is proposing concentration-basedtreatment standards. Further information on the development of treatmentstandards can be found in the Addendum to the Background Document for F024Wastes in the RCRA docket. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F024<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, TCLP (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>0.073</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.021</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.088</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F025<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">Light Ends Subcategory</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloroform <D>6.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloroethane <D>6.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethylene <D>6.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene chloride <D>31</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbon tetrachloride <D>6.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2-Trichloroethane <D>6.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trichloroethylene <D>5.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vinyl chloride <D>0.035</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F025<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">Light Ends Subcategory</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloroform <D>0.035</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloroethane <D>0.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethylene <D>0.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene chloride <D>0.037</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbon tetrachloride <D>0.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2-Trichloroethane <D>0.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trichloroethylene <D>0.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vinyl chloride <D>0.033</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F025<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">Spent Filters/Aids and Desiccants Subcategory</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloroform <D>6.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene chloride <D>31</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbon tetrachloride <D>6.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2-Trichloroethane <D>6.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trichloroethylene <D>5.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vinyl chloride <D>0.035</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorobenzene <D>37</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorobutadiene <D>28</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachloroethane <D>30</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>F025<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">Spent Filters/Aids and Desiccants Subcategory</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloroform <D>0.035</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene chloride <D>0.037</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbon tetrachloride <D>0.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2-Trichloroethane <D>0.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trichloroethylene <D>0.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vinyl chloride <D>0.033</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorobenzene <D>0.055</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorobutadiene.<D>0.031</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachloroethane.<D>0.034</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3> c. Wastes from Inorganic Pigment Production</T3>. These wastes aregenerated by facilities manufacturing and processing inorganic pigments,as well as from the treatment of the wastes themselves. Detailed technicaldescriptions of the specific production processes generating these wastescan be found in the Listing Background Document for these wastes, as wellas the BDAT Background Document for Inorganic Pigment Wastes. <T3>(1) Nonwastewaters.</T3> In the Final Second Third Rule (53 FR 26594;June 23, 1989), EPA promulgated treatment standards of ``No Land DisposalBased on No Generation'' for K005 and K007 wastes. In today's proposedrule, the Agency is revoking these standards because a source wishing tomanufacture these pigments in the future would be forced to apply for avariance from the treatment standard (40 CFR 268.44) in order to do so.In the First Third final rule, EPA also promulgated a standard of ``NoLand Disposal Based on No Generation'' for K004 and K008. EPA modifiedthis standard to apply only to certain newly generated waste as part ofthe May 2, 1989 final rule (54 FR 18836). On January 11, 1989 EPA alsoproposed to modify this designation to ``No Land Disposal Based on Recycling''.During the comment period for the Second Third proposed rule, EPA receivedinformation that the recycling operation under consideration for thesewastes may involve a limited captive market for the waste by-product; therefore,not all generators would be able to sell their processed K004 and K008.As a result, EPA revoked the ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''standard in the Second Third final rule (54 FR 26617). For K002, K003, and K006 (anhydrous) EPA considered proposing a treatmentstandard based on total recycling using secondary lead smelting. However,this process could also produce residues which may be subject to land disposalrestrictions. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to transfer the performanceof chromium reduction followed by precipitation and filtration from K062to K002, K003, K004, K005, K006 (anhydrous), and K008. The filter cakethat is generated from this treatment train may need further treatmentsuch as stabilization in order to prevent immobilization of toxic metals.EPA is proposing to transfer the K062 nonwastewaters standards to K002,K003, K004, K005, K006, and K008 nonwastewaters because the wastewatersfrom which K062 sludge are derived are similar in nature to the inorganicpigment wastewaters (i.e., consisting of inorganic constituents). The concentrationsof heavy metals in the untreated wastewaters are also similar. The onlydifference is that K062 wastewaters contain higher concentrations of nickeland chromium (see the BDAT Background Document for Inorganic Pigments).The Agency, however, is soliciting TCLP data on treated inorganic pigmentsludge. In the case of hydrated K006, one facility is manufacturing this pigment,hydrated chrome oxide green, using a boric acid process. Due to the presenceof boron, the sulfide precipitation results for K062 sludges may not betransferrable to this waste. Therefore, EPA is proposing to transfer thechromium standard from F006 to hydrated K006. This level is achievablefor hydrated K006 nonwastewaters. Data submitted by the manufacturer ofhydrated K006 indicates that five different stabilizing agents can reducethe hexavalent chromium to its trivalent stage. The process wastewatersunderwent chromium reduction and lime precipitation, then the sludge wasstabilized using various mixes of cement, fly ash, gypsum, ground burntlime, and silicate gel (a combination of fly ash and gypsum was the mostsuccessful). All of the five mixes easily met the chromium standard forF006. The Agency is soliciting further TCLP data on treated hydrated K006.<T3>(2) Wastewaters.</T3> The treatment of pigment sludge can generatewastewaters. These wastewaters are similar to treated and untreated wastewatersfrom the inorganic pigment manufacturing processes, depending on the typeof pigment being processed. EPA is therefore proposing regulations basedon the chrome pigment effluent guidelines for discharges from this industrialcategory regulated under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System(NPDES) (40 CFR 415.340). The proposed standards are taken directly fromthe concentrations as stated in the ``Development Document for EffluentLimitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards, and PretreatmentStandards for the Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing Point Source Category'',June, 1982. These standards are based on chromium conversion and lime precipitationto remove toxic metals. Because the effluent limitations guidelines andstandards contain both 30 day and one day numbers, the RCRA treatment standardlikewise requires compliance with 30 day and one day standards. The minimumsampling frequency recommended is once a week. The basis of the 30 daylimit is consecutive calendar days and not sampling days. The statisticalbasis for these one and 30 day values is set forth in the Development documentcited above.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K002, K003, K004, K006 <T4>(anhydrous), and </T4>K008 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, TCLP (mg/1)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>0.094</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.37</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K006 <T4>(hydrated) </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, TCLP (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>5.2</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K005 <T4>and </T4>K007 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, TCLP (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>0.094 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.37</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,6.2,8</C><T4>5BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4> K002, K003, K004, K006, <T4>and </T4>K008 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]  </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Total concentration (in mg/l)</H1><H2>30 day maximum </H2><H2>24 hour maximum</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>1.2 </D><D>0.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>1.4 </D><D>3.4</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,6.2,6.2</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K005 <T4>and </T4>K007 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Total concentration (in mg/l) </H1><H2>30 day maximum </H2><H2>24 hour maximum</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>1.2 </D><D>.9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>1.4 </D><D>3.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Total)<D>0.31 </D><D>0.74</D></ITAG></ITAG>d. K015 In the final First Third Rule (53 FR 31154), the Agency promulgated a treatmentstandard of ``No Land Disposal Based on No Ash'' for K015 nonwastewaters.Concentration-based standards for K015 wastewaters were promulgated atthat time. After promulgation, a facility generating K015 nonwastewaterssubmitted information indicating that their K015 waste generated an ashresidue upon combustion. Therefore, the Agency's assessment of these wastesnot having an ash content was incorrect. As a result, EPA is proposingto revoke the ``No Land Disposal Based on No Ash'' standard for the nonwastewaterforms of K015 (as well as the subcategorization based on ash content),and is proposing numerical treatment standards for all K015 nonwastewaterstoday. The Agency is proposing treatment standards for five organic and two metalconstituents. Treatment standards for the organic constituents are basedon a transfer of the performance data of incineration for similar wastes.Treatment standards for metal constituents are based on a transfer of theperformance of stabilization of incinerator ash for similar wastes. Sixsample sets from the treatment of K019 and five sample sets from the treatmentof K087 had been collected for rotary kiln incineration. These data setswere transferred to K015 nonwastewaters based on structural similarities.The constituent p-Dichlorobenzene is being used as a surrogate for benzalchloride; p-dichlorobenzene treatment data from K019 will be transferredto benzal chloride in K015. These constituents are similar in that theyare both chlorinated benzenes. The proposed toluene standards for KO15 are transferred directly from K019treatment data. Toluene is present at higher levels in untreated K019 wastethan in untreated K015 waste. Therefore, treatment by incineration shouldresult in at least as low a level of toluene in K015 nonwastewater as inK019. The proposed standards for benzo(b/k)fluoranthene in K015 are transferredfrom K087 treatment data. Both the b and k forms are found in K087, whereasonly the k form is present in K019. In addition, the untreated benzo(b/k)fluoranthenein K087 should be more difficult to treat than in K019, hence K087 is abetter source of transferred incineration data for benzo(b/k)fluoranthene.Proposed standards for anthracene and phenanthrene are transferred fromK087 data. These constituents are also found in untreated K019 waste; however,the concentrations of these constituents in K019 are not as high as inuntreated K015. Anthracene and phenanthrene are, however, present at higherconcentrations in K087 than in K015. Therefore, treatment by incinerationshould result in at least as low a level of these constituents in K015as in K087. The Addendum to the Background Document for K015 describeshow each standard was developed and presents the K019 and K087 treatabilitydata used to generate these standards. No performance data are available for treatment of metals in K015 nonwastewaters.However, data are available for stabilization of metals in the incineratorash of K048-K052. Based on the similarity of the constituents and theirconcentrations expected to be found in the untreated K015 incinerationash compared to K048-K052 ash, K015 ash appears to be sufficiently similarto the ash generated by incinerating K048-K052. No data exist characterizingmetal concentrations in untreated KO15 ash; however, nickel and chromiumwere found in the incinerator scrubber water. Hence, nickel and chromiumshould be expected in the ash and consequently EPA is proposing to regulatethem in K015 nonwastewaters. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s20,9,6.3</C>BDAT <T4>Treatment Standards for K</T4>015 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters; Revised from no land disposal] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l) </H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Anthracene <D>3.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzal chloride <D>6.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzo(b/k)fluoranthene <D>3.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene <D>3.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>6.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>1.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.048 </D></ITAG></ITAG> <T3>e. K022, K025, K026, K035, and K083. </T3>All of these wastes generallycontain similar treatable concentrations of aromatic organics and hydrocarbons.They thus are amenable to similar treatment technologies and present similartechnical difficulties in developing treatment standards. Thus, these wasteshave been grouped together under the same section for purposes of discussion.K022, K035, and K083 are scheduled First Third wastes, K025 is a SecondThird waste, and K026 is a Third Third waste. EPA promulgated nonwastewatertreatment standards for K022, K025, and K083 in the First Third final rule(53 FR 31138). EPA later deferred treatment for K083 nonwastewaters containingash to the Third Third in the May 2, 1989, final rule (53 FR at 18837).<T3>(1) Development of Treatment Standards.</T3> EPA has data that indicatenonwastewater forms of K025 and K026 are no longer generated in the UnitedStates. These wastes are currently subject to a treatment standard expressedas ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''. The Agency is proposingto revoke these standards in order that a source wishing to manufacturecommercial products by the manufacturing processes described in the listingdocument for these wastes will not be forced to apply for a variance fromthe treatment standard in order to do so.K025 is generated from the nitration of benzene which is a similar processto that which generates K111, K112, K103, and K104. Each one of these wasteshas constituents which are as difficult to treat as those constitutentsin K025. Available data characterizing the chemical composition of K025are very limited, therefore the Agency is proposing to transfer performancedata from K103 and K104 wastes to K025 in order to establish, as one option,concentration-based treatment standards, and as another option, a treatmentstandard expressed as a method.For K035 wastewaters, EPA is proposing standards based on process wastewatersfrom the distillation of coal-tars as a surrogate waste for developingtreatment standards. These process wastewaters are the precursors of K035wastewater treatment sludges listed as hazardous wastes in 40 CFR andSection;261.32.These process wastewaters contain the same constituents for regulationas those identified in the K035 nonwastewaters with the exception of o-cresol,p-cresol, and phenol. These three constituents were identified in the processwastewaters at treatable concentrations and EPA is proposing to regulatethem.EPA is proposing concentration based standards for the organics identifiedin K022, K026, K035, and K083 wastes. These treatment standards are basedon the incineration of similar nonwastewaters. As a result, EPA is alsoproposing incineration of these wastes as a prerequisite for land disposal.The concentration based standards for K026, K035, and K083 nonwastewatersare based on the concentration of organics achieved in the residual ashof the waste tested by EPA. Similarly, treatment standards for the K022,K026, K035, and K083 wastewaters are supported by the concentration organicsachieved in the incineration scrubber waters.  For K025, EPA is proposing concentration based treatment standards fororganics. The proposed treatment standards for the organics in K025 wastewatersare based on liquid-liquid extraction followed by stream stripping followedby carbon adsorption. As an alternative, the agency believes that the organicsin these wastes can be effectively treated and removed by either directcarbon adsorption or wet air oxidation followed by carbon adsorption. Theproposed treatment standards for K025 nonwastewaters are based on incineration.Alternatively, EPA is proposing requiring these methods of treatment asa prerequisite for land disposal of K025. Incineration of K025 wastewatersis also proposed as an equivalent method of treatment for K025 wastewaters.EPA prefers establishing methods of treatment for K025 and K026 becausethe lack of characterization data for them makes our approach uncertainin whether other constituents in the uncharacterized wastes that may beat treatable concentrations will or will not be regulated by the constituentsproposed for regulation.Available characterization for all these wastes show that only K022 andK083 have treatable concentrations of metals. As a result, EPA is proposingconcentration based treatment standards for the metals identified in K022and K083. The proposed treatment standards for K022 and K083 wastewatersare based on chemical precipitation of a similar waste to K022 and K083wastewaters. For the metals in K083 nonwastewaters, the proposed treatmentstandards are based on stabilization. Alternatively, EPA is proposing forK022 and K083 treatment standards expressed as methods of treatment. Themethods of treatment would be those BDAT technologies supporting the proposedconcentration based standards for these two wastes. To determine the applicabilityof the proposed treatment standards, the standard BDAT criteria shouldbe used to classify K022, K026, K035, and K083 as wastewaters or nonwastewaters.These standard BDAT criteria classify a waste as a wastewater if it containsless than one percent total suspended solid (TSS) and less than one percenttotal organic content (TOC). In contrast, K025 wastes are classified aswastewaters if they contain less than one percent TSS and less than 4 percentTOC. These wastes are classified as nonwastewaters if the TSS or TOC percentlevels are exceeded. EPA is proposing a different wastewater definitionfor K025 because, upon study, it appears that normal liquids carrying thiswaste code that are amenable to wastewater treatment can legitimately containup to 4% TOC (see BDAT Background Document of K025).The BDAT Background Documents for these wastes provide further discussionon the constituents proposed for regulation as well as the developmentof the treatment standards proposed today. The BDAT Background Documentfor K022 is referred as a Proposed Amendment to the Final BDAT BackgroundDocument for K022.

K036 and K037Today's rule proposes revised treatment standards for the wastewater formsof K037 and the nonwastewater forms of K036. Detailed technical descriptionsof the specific production processes generating these wastes can be foundin the background document for the listing of these wastes. These compoundswere included in the organophosphorus pesticides treatability group inthe Second Third proposed rule (54 FR 1085).The Agency promulgated a treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Basedon No Generation'' for K036 nonwastewaters in the First Third final ruleon August 8, 1988 (53 FR 31174, August 17, 1988). EPA amended this standardon May 2, 1989, to apply to wastes generated from the process describedin the listing description and disposed after August 17, 1988 (54 FR 18836).In today's rule the Agency is proposing to transfer a concentration basedstandard from K037 nonwastewaters to other forms of K036 nonwastewaters,such as K036 spill residues, and is proposing to revise the K037 wastewaterstandards. (The Agency promulgated concentration-based treatment standardsfor K037 wastewaters and nonwastewaters in the First Third final rule.)<T3>(1) Development of Standards.</T3> In the January 11, 1989, proposedrule for Second Third wastes (54 FR 1056), the Agency proposed a directtransfer of the concentration-based standards from the incineration ofK037 wastes (wastewater treatment sludge from the production of Disulfoton)to a number of organophosphorus pesticide wastes. The basis for transferringthe K037 standards is the similarity in structure and elemental compositionof Disulfoton, the principal hazardous constituent of concern in K037 wastes,to all of the organophosphorus pesticides. In addition, the Agency believesthat Disulfoton is one of the most difficult chemicals in that group oforganophosphorus pesticides to incinerate. Given that Disulfoton can beeffectively treated by incineration, the Agency believes that all the otherwastes in the organophosphorus pesticides treatability group can be effectivelytreated by incineration, and the concentration-based standard for eachrepresentative regulated organophosphorus pesticide can be identical tothat achieved by incineration of Disulfoton in K037 wastes. Therefore,the Agency believes that the performance achievable by incineration representsBDAT for nonwastewater forms of K036 and is proposing concentration-basedstandards based on a transfer from the incineration of K037 nonwastewaters.In the Second Third final rule, the Agency promulgated concentration-basedtreatment standards for the wastewater forms of the organophosphorus pesticides.These standards were proposed based on the concentrations found in scrubberwater from a K037 incineration test burn. The Agency received data duringthe comment period on biological treatment of wastewaters containing Parathion,a constituent similar to Disulfoton, that were used as the basis of thepromulgated treatment standards. Today the Agency is proposing to revisethe wastewater treatment standards for K037 to be consistent with the otherwastewater standards for organophosphorus pesticides.<T3>(2) Identification of BDAT and Regulated Constituents.</T3> Standardsapplicable to K036 nonwastewaters are based on the performance achievedby rotary kiln incineration and the concentration of organophosphorus pesticidemeasured in the ash residuals. Standards applicable to K037 wastewatersare based on the performance achieved by biological treatment and the concentrationof the regulated constituent (Disulfoton or Toluene) measured in the resultanteffluent wastewaters. Where the treatment standards are expressed as concentration-basedstandards, other treatment technologies that can achieve these concentration-basedtreatment standards are not precluded from use by this rule. The regulatedconstituents and treatment standards for these wastes are listed in thetables at the end of this section. The Agency points out that the promulgated concentration-based treatmentstandards for K037 wastewaters are based on the analysis of composite samplesrather than grab samples. These performance data used to develop the standardfor Disulfoton were received during the comment period for the Second ThirdProposed Rule, and were based on the analysis of composite effluent samples.The data used to develop the standard for Toluene is from the Office ofWater's Industrial Technology Division Database. See further discussionof composite samples in section III.A.1.f. of today's preamble. These dataare a preferable measure of treatment performance because where the Agencyhas performance data that conform with BDAT methodology on wastewater treatmentprocesses as well as data on incineration as measured by constituent concentrationsin scrubber water, the Agency prefers to establish treatment standardsbased on the wastewater treatment processes. (Note: This does not precludethe Agency from establishing treatment standards for other wastes basedon constituent concentrations in incinerator scrubber waters.)Today's rule proposes revised concentration-based standards for the wastewaterforms of K037 and the nonwastewater forms of K036.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K036<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Revised From No Land Disposal]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Disulfoton<D>0.1</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K037<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Revised Based on Biotreatment Data]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single composite sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Disulfoton<D>0.025</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene<D>0.080</D></ITAG></ITAG> <T3>g. K044, K045, K046, K047_(1) K044, K045, K047.</T3> Today's rule proposesto revoke the ``No Land Disposal Based on Reactivity'' treatment standardfor K044, K045, and K046 wastes and proposes to set a method of treatmentrather than concentration-based standards for these wastes. In the May2, 1989, final rule (54 FR 18836), the Agency indicated that it would notamend the standard for these wastes because the wastes are listed for exhibitingthe characteristic of reactivity. Although this is true, the Agency believesthat by revoking the standard and setting ``Deactivation as a Method ofTreatment'', a generator or treater can continue to dispose of this wasteafter the removal of the characteristic hazard.<T3>(2) K046.</T3>  In the August 17, 1989, final rule (53 FR 31158), theAgency developed two subcategories for the K046 nonwastewaters identifiedas the Reactive and Nonreactive Subcategories. The Agency based this subcategorizationon the comments received by industry indicating that K046 Reactive wasteswere not similar to the K046 Nonreactive wastes due to their reactivity.The nonreactive K046 wastes could be directly stabilized; however, stabilizationof the reactive K046 wastes would result in a residual that could remainreactive. The Agency agreed and promulgated a treatment standard for leadin K046 Nonreactive nonwastewaters, but did not promulgate a standardsfor the K046 Reactive nonwastewaters nor did it promulgate wastewater standardsfor any K046 wastewaters. The Agency indicated in the First Third Rulethat it would examine the data from testing of Nonreactive K046 nonwastewaters,and would determine whether these data could be extrapolated to ReactiveK046 wastes or whether new data had to be obtained to set treatment standardsfor open detonation, open burning, or specialized incineration.In this rule, the Agency is proposing a nonwastewater treatment standardfor lead in the K046 Reactive Subcategory. BDAT for this waste is basedon information that indicates that the K046 nonreactive waste for whichthe treatment standard was promulgated, originally started out as reactivewastewaters. The Agency believes that by removing the reactivity of thesewastewaters, the resultant nonwastewater K046 will not be reactive andthus will be similar to the K046 nonreactive wastes for which the Agencypromulgated standards (see 54 FR 26607-608 (June 23, 1989) regarding wastetreatment that may occur before the listed waste is generated). In addition,the Agency believes that if the K046 nonwastewaters are generated as reactive,they could also be slurried in water and then treated by the same controlledchemical oxidation processes, again resulting in a nonreactive K046 nonwastewater.Thus, the nonwastewater standard for K046 reactive wastes is based on datatransferred from the performance of stabilization of the K046 nonreactivewastes. BDAT is based on the performance of deactivation for the reactivewastewaters followed by alkaline precipitation, settling, and filtrationto form a nonreactive K046 nonwastewater that is then stabilized for lead.For all of the K046 wastewaters, BDAT is based on the performance of alkalineprecipitation, settling, and filtration. The Agency is transferring theperformance of this treatment system from K062 wastes. The Agency believesthat the K062 wastewaters are just as difficult to treat based on the concentrationof lead in K062 (up to 212 ppm) which is the same or higher than that whichhas been found in K046 wastewaters (up to 200 ppm).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),s100</C><T4> BDAT Treatment for </T4>K044, K045, K047<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters and Wastewaters]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Revised From No Land Disposal]</ITAG><H1>Deactivation as a method of treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K044, K045, K046 <T4>and</T4> K047 <T4>Subcategories </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single composite sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>0.037</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K046<T4> Reactive Subcategory</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single composite sample, TCLP (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>0.18</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>h. K060.</T3> In the August 17, 1989 final rule (53 FR 31174), theAgency promulgated ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' for K060nonwastewaters. EPA amended this standard in the May 2, 1989 final ruleto apply only to certain newly generated wastes (54 FR 18838). Today, theAgency is proposing to revoke this standard since a facility might legitimatelyuse ammonia as a reagent in the coking process and therefore may generatethis waste. For more detailed technical information about waste characterizationand treatment technologies refer to the Best Demonstrated Available Technology(BDAT) Background Document for K060. <T3>(1) Wastewaters.</T3> Today, the Agency is proposing wastewater standardsbased on the performance of biological treatment followed by settling andclarification. These treatment standards are transferred from the Officeof Water Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standardsfor the Iron and Steel Industry Manufacturing Point Source Category CokeMaking Subcategory.The Agency evaluated two types of treatment processes: dephenolizationfollowed by alkaline chlorination and biological treatment followed bysettling and clarification. Both data sets were available from the Officeof Water Development Document for Effluent Guidelines and Standards forthe Iron and Steel Industry Manufacturing Point Source Category Coke MakingManufacture. The Agency believes that the performance data from biologicaltreatment followed by settling and clarification were best because theuntreated values were higher and the treated values were lower. Therefore,this treatment system treated a more difficult waste and therefore thesystem's performance should be transferrable to K060. For the cyanide constituents in the wastewaters, the treatment standardsare based on the performance of alkaline chlorination for F006 throughF009 wastes. The Agency believes that this is technically feasible dueto the fact that the F006 through F009 wastes are more difficult to treatbecause of the higher cyanide concentrations (i.e., 30,000 ppm) and presenceof non-cyanide complexes. <T3>(2) Nonwastewaters.</T3> In today's rule, the Agency is proposing nonwastewatertreatment standards for organic and cyanides based on a transfer of theperformance of incineration for K087. K087 wastes are generated from thesame industry (coking industry) as K060 wastes and have similar or higherconcentrations of K060. Therefore, the Agency believes that this technologytransfer is feasible.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K060<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any 24 hour composite sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene<D>0.17 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzo(a) pyrene<D>0.035 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene<D>0.028 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenol<D>0.042 </D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,ns,tp0,i1,s50,7.3</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l) </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Total)<D>1.9 </D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K060 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Revised From No Land Disposal] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene<D>0.071 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzo(a) pyrene<D>3.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthalene<D>3.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenol<D>3.4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Total)<D>1.2</D></ITAG></ITAG> <T3>i. K061. </T3>In the August 17, 1988 final rule (53 FR 31162), theAgency promulgated treatment standards for K061 nonwastewaters but didnot promulgate treatment standards for K061 wastewaters. K061 wastewaterscan be generated from dewatered sludges, CERCLA sites, and during correctiveaction at RCRA facilities. Based on single source leachate informationfrom the Generator's Survey, K061 wastewaters generally have low concentrationsof dissolved metals (i.e., less than 100 ppm). Because of these low concentrationsof dissolved metals, the Agency believes that a transfer of the performanceof hexavalent chromium followed by precipitation with lime or sulfide andsludge dewatering for K062 wastewaters is technically feasible. In addition,the Agency believes that the K062 wastewaters are more difficult to treat than the K061 wastewaters because of the high concentration of dissolvedmetals, i.e. 5,000 ppm of dissolved metals.EPA promulgated treatment standards for nonwastewater forms of K061 aspart of the First Third final regulation. In this rule, two subcategoriesfor nonwastewaters forms of K061 were defined. The low zinc subcategory(less than 15%) and the high zinc subcategory (greater than 15%) were definedas separate treatability groups. BDAT for the low zinc subcategory wasbased on the performance of stabilization. For the high zinc subcategory,the final standard was ``No Land Disposal Based on High Temperature MetalsRecovery as a Method of Treatment'' technology (53 FR 31221). The standardtakes effect in August, 1990 and due to a shortage of treatment capacity,an interim numerical standard based on performance of stabilization technologyis in force until that time.Today, EPA is proposing to revise the promulgated treatment standard forthe high zinc subcategory to be ``Resmelting in a High Temperature ZincMetal Recovery Furnace.'' Specifying this treatment method more accuratelyreflects the Agency's intentions in promulgating the first third regulation,and does not reflect a change in regulatory approach.EPA also notes that in establishing resmelting technology as a treatmentmethod, residues from the process may be land disposed without furthertreatment. (54 FR 26631-32, June 23, 1989) (Where EPA specifies a methodof treatment under section 3004(m), residues from that treatment processmay be land disposed without further treatment.) That result is appropriatehere. Data gathered as part of the First Third rulemaking (and part ofthis rulemaking record) indicate that the slag that results from high temperaturemeta1s recovery has metals mobility levels comparable to (and in some cases,lower than) that achieved by stabilization technologies. To the extentthat stabilization may perform somewhat better, EPA still views high temperaturemetals recovery as superior because it furthers the statutory objectivesof recycling and waste minimization while still achieving significant reductionsof metal mobility. (See H. Rep. No. 198, 98th Cong, 1st Sess. 31 describinga preferred hierarchy of management options, and ranking recycling andmaterials recovery as preferable options to conventional treatment.) Sincestabilization potentially adds to the volume of waste requiring land disposal(through addition of cementitious binding agents), and does not performsignificantly better in reducing metals mobility, EPA does not believethat it constitutes the ultimate best available technology for K061.To assure that the metals recovery process performs efficiently, however,EPA is also reiterating that any residues must not exhibit any of the characteristicsof hazardous waste (see also the general discussion of this issue in preamblesection III.C). If they do, they would have to meet the treatment standardfor that characteristic. None of the residues from recovery of K061 inEPA's existing data base exhibit any hazardous waste characteristic.EPA is further soliciting comment regarding the advisability of extendingthe duration of the existing, interim treatment standard (based on performanceof stabilization technology) for another year. EPA is doing so becauseavailable information suggests that there is insufficient high temperaturemetals recovery capacity to handle demand for this waste. If this werethe sole treatment standard, generators could apply for and potentiallyreceive case-by-case variances and the waste would not be required to betreated before being land disposed. EPA is also concerned about the administrativecosts and burdens of applying for a case-by-case variance, and the difficultiesfaced by waste generators while variance petitions are being evaluated.On the other hand, the Agency does not wish to create a disincentive toconstruction of new metal recovery capacity. Nor does the Agency wish toreward companies that have not prepared for meeting a treatment standardbased on high temperature metals recovery. Accordingly, EPA seeks informationabout efforts made to construct and operate this type of technology, andwhat arrangements are being made to enter into binding contractual arrangementsto utilize this technology (cf. RCRA Section 3004(h)(3) where this is partof the test for granting a case-by-case variance). Based upon this information(and other relevant information that may develop), the Agency will determinewhether to extend the existing standard as an alternative to high temperaturemetals recovery.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K061<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters_High Zinc Subcategory]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Revised from No Land Disposal]  </ITAG><H1>Resmelting in high temperature zinc metal recovery furnace as a methodof treatment.</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> K061<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>1.61</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium<D>0.32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>0.04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>0.44</D></ITAG></ITAG> <T3>j. K069. </T3>In today's rule, the Agency is proposing treatment standardsfor K069 nonwastewaters in the Calcium Sulfate Subcategory, and for wastewaterforms of K069. In addition, the Agency is proposing to revoke the no landdisposal based on recycling treatment standard for the Non Calcium SulfateSubcategory for K069 nonwastewaters and is proposing ``Recycling as a Methodof Treatment''. <T3>(l) Wastewaters.</T3> BDAT treatment standards for K069 wastewatersare based on the performance of precipitation with lime and sulfide andsludge dewatering for K062 wastes. Waste characterization data available to the Agency indicate that K069wastewaters contain cadmium and lead. The concentration of cadmium is lessthan 2 ppm and the concentration of lead ranges up to 80 ppm. The Agencybelieves that this transfer is technically feasible due to the higher concentrationof dissolved metals that are present in K062 wastes. Therefore, the Agencybelieves that the K062 waste is a more difficult waste to treat and thusthe performance of the treatment system can be legitimately transferred.<T3>(2) Nonwastewaters.</T3> BDAT for K069 nonwastewaters in the CalciumSulfate Subcategory is stabilization. The Agency believes that there isonly one generator of this waste and that this waste cannot be directlyrecycled to recover lead. The waste characterization data from the onegenerator indicate that this waste contains metal constituents such ascadmium and lead. The metal concentrations range up to 3300 ppm. For the K069 nonwastewaters in the Calcium Sulfate Subcategory, the Agencyis proposing to transfer the treatment performance of stabilization forK061 waste to the K069 nonwastewaters. The Agency believes that this isa technically feasible transfer because the K061 waste is a more difficultwaste to treat. In fact, the metal concentrations in K061 waste rangesup to 20,300 ppm. Therefore, the Agency believes that K069 nonwastewaterscan be treated to similar concentration levels as K061, thus the performanceof the treatment system can  be ligitimately transferred.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K069 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>1.61 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.04</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for</T4> K069 <T4>Calcium Sulfate Subcategory </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any simple Grab sample TCLP (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>0.14 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>0.24</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(4,4,0),i1,s50  </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K069 <T4>on Calcium Subcategory </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">[Revised from No Land Disposal]  </ITAG><H1>Recycling as a method of treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><T3>k. Revisions to K086. </T3>Revisions are being proposed today for theK086 solvent washes treatment standards that were promulgated in the FirstThird final rule (53 FR 31168, August 17, 1988). Treatment standards forthe other K086 treatability groups that have been subject to the ``softhammer'' provisions of 40 CFR 268.8. are also being proposed. For a descriptionof K086 wastes, see 40 CFR 268.33 and the K086 Listing Background Document.Since promulgation of the First Third rule, EPA has collected samples ofK086 caustic sludges and water sludges for the purposes of waste characterizationand determination of BDAT. Based on the treatment of these samples, EPAbelieves that it is unnecessary to subcategorize this waste code (beyondsubcategorization for wastewaters and non-wastewaters).The majority of the facilities generating K086 claim they are phasing outor no longer formulating inks derived from chromium and lead based materials.Current management practices include solvent recoveries (from solvent washesand sludges), incineration (corrosive K086 wastes), and fuel substitution(solvent and metal-containing wastes). These technologies are demonstratedand applicable to K086.Treatment data for wastes believed similar to K086 show that all K086 wastes_solvent,caustic, and water washes, and their sludges_can be treated by incineration.These treatment data also show that a wide range of technologies are availableto recover valuable constituents or energy from K086 wastes. (These recoverytechnologies, however, frequently result in residues that require furthertreatment prior to land disposal.) Based on these data, EPA is proposingtreatment standards for organics in K086 wastewaters and nonwastewatersbased on incineration. For the metal constituents, the Agency is proposingtreatment standards based on the performance of hexavalent chromium reductionto trivalent chromium followed by excess lime precipitation, filtration.Except for methanol, the development of the treatment standards for theorganics in K086 wastes is consistent with the corresponding U and P treatmentstandards. Both the BDAT Background Document for K086-Solvent Washes andits November 1989, Addendum further discusses the treatment data supportingthe proposed treatment standards for the organic and inorganic constituentsin K086 wastes. The Agency is proposing to expand the list of regulated constituents inK086 to include acetophenone, di-n-butylphthalate, and cyanide. Bis (2-ethylhexyl)phthalate is currently subject to regulation in the current K086 solventwash treatability group. New characterization data indicate that K086 alsocontains treatable concentrations of di-n-butylphthalate; therefore, theAgency is proposing to add this constituent for regulation. In addition,the Agency is proposing to include other phthalates identified in the BDATlist in order to prevent the regulated community from simply switchingto other phthalates for the purpose of avoiding regulation.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>086<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Acetone <D>0.14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Acetophenone <D>9.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate <D>28</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> n-Butyl alcohol <D>2.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Butylbenzylphthalate <D>28</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Cyanide (total) <D>1.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Cyclohexanone <D>1.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> I,2-Dichlorobenzene <D>6.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Diethyl phthalate <D>28</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Dimethyl phthalate <D>28</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Di-n-butyl phthalate <D>28</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Di-n-octyl phthalate <D>28</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Ethyl acetate <D>5.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Ethylbenzene <D>33</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Methanol <D>140</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Methyl isobutyl ketone <D>33</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl ethyl ketone <D>200</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Methylene chloride <D>31</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Napthalene <D>5.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Nitrobenzene <D>14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Toluene <D>28</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> 1,1,1-Trichloroethane <D>6.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Trichloroethylene <D>5.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Xylenes (Total) <D>33  </D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,7.3</C> <H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, TCLP (mg/1)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium<D>0.094</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>0.37 </D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,6.4</C>BDAT Treatment Standards for K086<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/1)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Acetone <D>0.25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acetophenone <D>0.I7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate <D>0.54</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">n-Butyl alcohol <D>0.56</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Butylbenzylphthalate <D>0.54</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyclohexanone <D>1.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichlorobenzene <D>0.058</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Diethyl phthalate <D>0.54</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Diethyl phthalate <D>0.54</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Di-n-butyl phthalate <D>0.54</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Di-n-octyl phthalate <D>0.54</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethyl acetate <D>0.0052</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethylbenzene <D>0.032</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methanol <D>\1\ 0.033</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl isobutyl ketone <D>0.028</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl ethyl ketone <D>0.14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methylene chloride <D>0.037</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Napthalene <D>0.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrobenzene <D>0.033</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Toluene <D>0.032</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,1-Trichloroethane <D>0.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trichloroethylene <D>0.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xylenes (Total) <D>0.028</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Total) <D>1.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>0.32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.037</D><F>\1\ Standard for methanol is based on analysis of a composite sampleusing SW-846 Method 8000.</F></ITAG></ITAG>1. K100. Treatment standards for K100 wastes were originally scheduledto be promulgated as part of the Third Third rulemaking. However, a treatmentstandard of ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' for K100 nonwastewaterswas promulgated on August 8, 1988 and subsequently revised on May 2, 1989(54 FR 18836) to be applicable only to ``Nonwastewater forms of these wastesgenerated by the process described in the listing description and disposedafter August 17, 1988, and not generated in the course of treating wastewaterforms of these wastes [Based on No Generation].'' In the proposal for the Second Third Wastes (54 FR 1056 (January 11, 1989)),EPA stated its intention to develop concentration-based treatment standardsfor all forms of K100 prior to May 8, 1990, and has decided to proposeto revoke the promulgated treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Basedon No Generation'' for K100 nonwastewaters. EPA prefers to set concentration-basedtreatment standards in lieu of this standard and is today proposing thesefor K100 nonwastewaters. Concentration-based treatment standards for all wastewater forms of K100are proposed today based on the transfer of performance data for metalsprecipitation from K062 wastewaters and data for metals stabilization fromf006 nonwastewaters. The Agency reminds commenters that there are very few (if any) of thesewastes that are currently being generated as originally listed and thatthe standards will probably only be applied to residues from previous disposalthat should be less difficult to treat than the original waste as generated.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>100 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>1.61 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium<D>0.32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>0.040</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>100 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="96">(REVISE FROM NO LAND DISPOSAL)</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, TCLP (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>0.066 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium<D>5.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>0.51</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>m.

The wasteslisted below are typically found as gaseous materials when existing athigh concentrations. Since it is difficult to ``spill'' a gas on soil orin water, it is unlikely that these wastes could exist as spill residues.While these compounds may exist as aqueous or organic solutions, the solutionsmay not be considered the listed product. The original listing specificallyexcluded chemical products that simply contained U or P constituents. However,EPA is concerned about the possibility that full containers of these wastesmay have to be disposed of in a cleanup situation. EPA solicits commentsfrom anyone who feels they may be land disposing these wastes or may haveto do so in the future.Since all three of these wastes are probably generated as gases and sinceindustry typically reuses or recovers compressed gases directly, the Agencyis proposing a treatment standard of ``Recovery as a Method of Treatment''for all P076, P078, and U115 wastes. Besides, the Agency currently hasno specific data on the treatment of P076 or P078, nor can it determinea treatment technology that would be applicable. Thus, the Agency solicitscomment on these issues for these wastes and also whether there is evena need to promulgate treatment standards for these wastes.Concentration-based standards for these wastes would be complicated bythe fact that these compounds are gases. While some analytical techniquesdo exist, the fact that they are gases complicates the analysis of treatmentresiduals. (The sampling and analysis procedures for these constituentswould have to minimize potential losses.) However, the Agency has recently received data from a facility that hadgenerated a U115 wastewater and nonwastewater. Under the soft hammer provisions,the facility had to demonstrate treatment for these wastes prior to landdisposal. The wastes contained up to 26.5 ppm of ethylene oxide. Treatmentincluded incineration of the nonwastewaters and chemical oxidation of thewastewaters. In all cases, the ethylene oxide was reduced to detectionlimits. These data were received too late for the Agency to develop concentration-basedtreatment standards for U115 wastes. However, these data are being placedin the administrative record for today's notice and treatment standardsfor U115 wastes may be promulgated based on these data.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(,0,4),s25</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for P</T4>076, <T4>P</T4>078, <T4>and U</T4>115  <H1>Recovery as a method of treatment</H1><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG></ITAG><T3>n. Revision of Petroleum Refining Wastes. </T3>On August 8, 1988, EPApromulgated treatment standards for regulated constituents in K048-K052wastewaters and nonwastewaters. The promulgated BDAT treatment standardswere based on data that were collected by EPA on incineration of thesewastes, data that were submitted to the Agency on solvent extraction ofthe wastes, and data for treatment of metals in the wastewater and nonwastewaterresiduals. However, some of the solvent extraction data were not submittedto the Agency in time to allow them to be fully evaluated before the promulgationdate. As a result, EPA reserved the treatment standards for several organicconstituents in K048-K052 nonwastewaters. Since promulgation of K048-K052treatment standards, the Agency has received additional data on treatmentof these wastes. The Agency has also recently collected data on solventextraction of these wastes. Where EPA has set a treatment standard, it is not precluded from revisingthat standard after the statutory date provided that rulemaking proceduresare followed. RCRA Section 3004(m)(1) states specifically that treatmentstandards are to be revised as appropriate. EPA believes that revisionof these standards is appropriate and timely. Therefore, the EPA is todayproposing revised BDAT treatment standards based on a re-evaluation ofthe currently available data and is proposing that these revised standards,with five exceptions, take effect exactly one year following the ThirdThird Rulemaking promulgation date to allow the petroleum refining industrysufficient time to adjust to changes from the K048-K052 BDAT treatmentstandards previously promulgated. The five exceptions are benzo(a) pyrene,ortho- and para-cresols, di-n-butyl phthalate, and phenol. These standardswould increase based on the revised data, and therefore, are proposed tobe effective on August 8, 1990. Until the revised standards take effectfor all other constituents, the previously promulgated standards which,due to the 2 year capacity variance issued for K048-K052 wastes as partof the First Third rule, become effective on August 8, 1990, will remainin effect. Specific changes to the BDAT treatment standards that are beingproposed today are discussed below. The Agency is today proposing to add cyanide as a regulated constituentfor K048-K052 wastewaters and is proposing a BDAT treatment standard forcyanide based on incineration of these wastes. At the time of proposalfor the First Third wastes, the Agency did not have data on treatment ofcyanide for K048-K052 wastewaters and did not have data on treatment ofcyanide in other wastes that could be transferred to K048-K052 wastewaters.Data on cyanide in combustion gas scrubber water from incineration of K048became available to the Agency late in the regulatory schedule for theFirst Third wastes. These data have now been used to develop the proposedThird Third treatment standards for cyanide in K048-K052 wastewaters. Thus,for K048-K052 wastes containing cyanide, the Agency expects treatment tooccur using incineration technologies. Solvent extraction, although considereda BDAT technology for all other organic constituents regulated in K048-K052nonwastewaters, has not been demonstrated to treat cyanide. The proposedtreatment standard for cyanide in K048-K052 wastewaters is shown in thetable at the end of this section. After the close of the comment period for the proposed regulations forFirst Third wastes, EPA received additional data on solvent extractiontreatment of K048-K052 wastes. These data were received too late to allowa full evaluation and inclusion in the development of the promulgated BDATtreatment standards. Since promulgation of the land disposal restrictionsfor First Third wastes in August 1988, the Agency has reviewed these dataas well as additional new data submitted following promulgation. The Agencyhas also recently completed a solvent extraction treatment test on a mixtureof K048 and K051 waste. For most of the regulated organic constituentsin K048-K052 nonwastewaters, the new solvent extraction data show betteror similar treatment than the data used to develop the previously promulgatedstandards. Overall, the Agency believes that the new data provide the mostsubstantial treatment for the greatest number of organic constituents ofconcern than all of the other solvent extraction data available to theAgency. Therefore, the Agency is proposing revised treatment standardsfor the organics already covered in the K048-K052 nonwastewater treatmentstandards based on the results of this treatment test. The Agency has notreevaluated the selection of solvent extraction and incineration as BDATfor organics in nonwastewaters but has instead incorporated the additionalsolvent extraction performance data into the revision of these treatmentstandards. As before, these wastes may be treated by any treatment technologycapable of achieving the treatment standard. The Agency also is proposing nonwastewater treatment standards for twoconstituents for which it reserved treatment standards in the First Thirdrule, naphthalene and xylene. The results from the recently completed Agency-sponsoredsolvent extraction test provide treatment performance data for solventextraction of these constituents as well (as the other regulated organicconstituents in K048-K052 nonwastewaters). There are important environmentalreasons to develop treatment standards for xylene and naphthalene in thesewastes. These solvents have been found to be present at high concentrationsin these wastes (0.1 percent or higher), and at these levels can readilymobilize other land disposed constituents or degrade landfill liners resultingin increased mobilization. The Agency also is concerned about the potentialcontribution of these constituents to VOC emissions from land disposalfacilities. Thus, treatment of these constituents will clearly serve toreduce the mobility of land disposed K048-K052 wastes (and any wastes withwhich they are co-disposed) (see Section 3004(m)(1)). EPA has recently received treatment performance data, and a separate rulemakingpetition, from Exxon Company, U.S.A. and the American Petroleum Institute(API). The thrust of the petition is that certain of the promulgated treatmentstandards are unachievable. These data were not received by the Agencyin time to be fully evaluated for this proposed rulemaking. The data arementioned here and included in the administrative record for this proposedrulemaking to provide sufficient notice to commenters of their availability.These data will be fully evaluated by the Agency and may be used by theAgency to provide further revisions to the K048-K052 BDAT treatment standards,if appropriate, in the Third Third final rule. The revised BDAT treatment standards that are being proposed for organicconstituents in K048-K052 nonwastewaters and for cyanide in K048-K052 wastewatersare listed in the tables at the end of this section. The Agency is notproposing revisions to promulgated BDAT treatment standards for constituentsin K048-K052 wastewaters other than cyanide, nor for any metal constituentsin either K048-K052 wastewaters or nonwastewaters. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>048, <T4>K</T4>049, <T4>K</T4>050, <T4>K</T4>051 <T4>and K</T4>052<ITAG tagnum="96"> [Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (Total)<D> 0.028</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2</C><T4> REVISED BDAT Treatment Standards for Organics in K</T4>048<ITAG tagnum="96"> [Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene <D>3.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzo(a)pyrene <D>1.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate <D>4.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Chrysene <D>0.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Di-n-butyl phthalate <D>4.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Ethylbenzene <D>0.08</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Naphthalene <D>0.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenanthrene <D>0.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Phenol <D>4.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pyrene <D>1.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Toluene <D>3.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Xylenes (Total) <D>8.5</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2</C><T4> Revised BDAT Treatment Standards for Organics in K</T4>049<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1"> Anthracene <D>1.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Benzene <D>3.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Benzo(a)pyrene <D>1.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate <D>4.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Chrysene <D>0.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Ethylbenzene <D>0.08</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Naphthalene <D>0.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Phenanthrene <D>0.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Phenol <D>4.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Pyrene <D>1.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Toluene <D>3.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Xylenes (Total) <D>8.5</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,9.1</C><T4> Revised BDAT Treatment Standards for Organics in K</T4>050<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1"> Benzo(a)pyrene <D>1.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Phenol <D>4.3</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2</C><T4> Revised BDAT Treatment Standards for Organics in K</T4>051<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1"> Anthracene <D>1.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Benzene <D>3.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Benzo(a)anthracene <D>I.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Benzo(a)pyrene <D>1.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate <D>4.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Chrysene <D>0.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Di-n-butyl phthalate <D>4.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Ethylbenzene <D>0.08</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Naphthalene <D>0.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Phenanthrene <D>0.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Phenol <D>4.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Pyrene <D>1.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Toluene <D>3.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Xylenes (Total) <D>8.5</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2</C><T4> Revised BDAT Treatment Standards for Organics in K</T4>052<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1"> Benzene <D>3.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Benzo(a)pyrene <D>1.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> o-Cresol <D>6.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> p-Cresol <D>6.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Ethylbenzene <D>0.08</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Naphthalene <D>0.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Phenanthrene <D>0.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Phenol <D>4.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Toluene <D>3.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> Xylenes (Total) <D>8.5</D></ITAG></ITAG> <T3>o. Additional Treatment Standards for F002 and F005. </T3>The Agencypromulgated treatment standards for F001-F005 listed wastes in the Solventsand Dioxins Rule (51 FR 40572, November 7, 1986). On February 25, 1986the Agency amended the listing of F002 and F005 to include four new constituents:1,1,2-trichloroethane, benzene, 2-ethoxyethanol, and 2-nitropropane (51FR 6737). These are organic compounds that are usually used for their solventproperties.Although HSWA directs the Agency to restrict the disposal of these newconstituents six months after they were listed, EPA was unable to proposeor promulgate treatment standards because there were no SW-846 analyticalmethods that could satisfactorily analyze 2-ethoxyethanol and 2-nitropropanein complex waste matrices. Therefore, the Agency has been unable to proposetreatment standards for these constituents until today's notice.The Agency synthesized several wastewaters containing these constituentsin order to conduct treatability studies and to identify appropriate analyticalmethods. To develop today's proposed treatment standards, the Agency modifiedexisting SW-846 analytical methods so that they were applicable to 2-ethoxyethanoland 2-nitropropane. (For further information on the synthesis of thesewastewaters and the development of these analytical methods, consult theF002 and F005 Background Document in the administrative record for today'sproposal.)The Agency has determined that biological treatment represents BDAT fortreatment of 1,1,2-trichloroethane, benzene, and 2-ethoxyethanol. Wastewatertreatment standards are being proposed today for 1,1,2-trichloroethaneof 0.03 mg/l, benzene of 0.07 mg/l, and 2-ethoxyethanol of 73.3 mg/l basedon the performance of biological treatment.The Agency has determined that liquid-liquid extraction followed by steamstripping followed by carbon adsorption represents BDAT for 2-nitropropanewastewaters. Based on the performance of this treatment train the Agencyis proposing a treatment standard of 0.056 mg/1 for this constituent inwastewaters. The Agency also examined the performance of steam strippingalone for treatment of 2-nitropropane wastewaters and developed a treatmentstandard of 1.35 mg/1. The Agency is concerned about the validity of thesteam stripping data because the holding times of the samples supportingthe 1.35 mg/1 limit were exceeded. The Agency is also evaluating the needfor recreating the steam stripping test studies of 2-nitropropane becausethe reduction of 2-nitropropane was achieved at the expense of significantamounts of energy. The high energy demands may have been a result of aninappropriate steam stripper design or the azeotropic behavior of 2-nitropropanewith water. As a result, the Agency is proposing the 0.056 mg/1 level,and solicits comment on this proposed approach.Incineration represents BDAT for all of the newly listed F002 and F005constituents in nonwastewaters. The Agency does not have incineration datafrom the treatment of the four newly-listed F002 and F005 organics. However,the Agency has performance data from incineration of nonwastewaters containingtreatable concentrations of the same or similar constituents. (See preamblesection III.A.1.d. for further discussion of the transfer of treatmentstandards.) Nonwastewater treatment standards are being proposed todayfor 1,1,2-trichloroethane of 7.6 mg/kg, benzene of 3.72 mg/kg, and 2-ethoxyethanolof 47.5 mg/kg, and 2-nitropropane of 5.6 mg/kg, based on the transfer ofincineration performance data.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F</T4>002<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Regulated Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2-Trichloroethane<D>6.2</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F</T4>002<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any composite sample, total Composition (mg/l)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2-Trichloroethane<D>0.054</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,8.2</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F</T4>005<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample, total composition (mg/kg)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene<D>3.72</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2-Ethoxyethanol<D>47.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2-Nitropropane<D>5.6</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,7.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F</T4>005<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Regulated constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any composite sample, total composition (mg/l)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene<D>0.07</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2 Ethoxyethanol<D>73.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2-Nitropropane<D>0.073</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>7. Development of Treatment Standards for Multi-Source Leachate_a.Background. </T3>In the final rule for the First Third Wastes (August 17,1988 (53 FR 31146-31150)) the Agency reiterated that leachate derived fromthe disposal of listed wastes is a hazardous waste based on the derived-fromrule. The Agency took the position that the waste code-specific treatmentstandards for the land disposed waste(s) from which the leachate is derivedapplied to the leachate (this idea has acquired the label of ``waste codecarry-through principle'', although this label is something of an oversimplificationbecause it merges the ideas of carry-through of a treatment standard withcarry-through of a waste label for permitting purposes; these issues neednot be identical, as discussed in section e. below). EPA later revisitedthe issue of leachate treatability and determined that there were significantunresolved issues regarding availability of leachate treatment capacity,and that further study of treatability of leachate derived from the co-disposalof multiple waste codes (i.e., more than two waste codes) was warranted.These wastes have thus been designated as multi-source leachate (see 54FR 8264 (Feb. 27, 1989)). Single-source leachate must meet the wastewaterand nonwastewater standards for the underlying waste code from which itwas derived. <T3>Id.</T3>The Agency consequently rescheduled most multi-source leachate to the third-thirdof the schedule. <T3>Id.</T3> The only type of multisource leachate not rescheduled is thatderived from disposal of the listed dioxin-containing hazardous wastes.Such leachate remains the subject of a judicial stay order entered by apanel from the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals which staysthe applicability of the waste code carry-through principle to multi-sourceleachate whose prohibition date was not rescheduled by the Agency.<T3>(1) Definition of Multi-source Leachate. </T3>Leachate is defined in40 CFR 260.10 as any liquid, including any suspended components in theliquid, that has percolated through or drained from hazardous waste. Leachatethat is derived from the disposal of listed hazardous wastes is classifiedas a hazardous waste by virtue of the ``derived-from'' rule in 40 CFR 261.3(c)(2).Multi-source leachate is leachate that is derived from the disposal ofmore than one listed hazardous waste (i.e., more than one waste code).54 FR 8264 (February 27, l989). EPA is soliciting comment below on consideringleachate derived exclusively from F021-F023, and F025-F028 dioxin-containingwastes to be single-source leachate. EPA also solicits comment on a narrowerdefinition of multi-source leachate which would say that leachate mustbe derived from more than one treatability group (rather than more thanone waste code) to be considered ``multi-source''. EPA is soliciting commenton this point both because it appears that leachate derived exclusivelyfrom wastes within a single treatability group would be able to meet thetreatment standards for that treatability group because it is more dilute,and because members of the regulated community have voiced concern at beingsubject to standards encompassing all toxic pollutants (a virtually inevitableconsequence of classifying multi-source leachate as any leachate derivedfrom more than one waste code). By ``treatability group, EPA is referringto the groupings of wastes in this proposed rule such as ``halogenatedaliphatics'', or ``phenolics''. Scheduled wastes from earlier rulemakingswould be part of a single treatability group if grouped within an industrygrouping in andSection; 261.32 (hazardous wastes generated from specificsources). For example, the K048-052 series of wastes would constitute asingle treatability group since all the wastes come from the petroleumrefining process.<T3>(2) Applicability. </T3>Leachate can become subject to the land disposalrestrictions if it is removed from a land disposal unit for disposal afterthe prohibition effective date for the underlying waste (see <T3>Chemical  Waste Management </T3>v<T3>. EPA</T3>, 869 F. 2d. 1526, 1536 (D.C.Cir. 1989)). Furthermore, tothe extent that such leachate is derived from wastes that were listed ashazardous on November 8, 1984 (the date of the HSWA amendments), it issubject to the statutory hard hammer in section 3004(g) which applies toall wastes that were listed as hazardous on the date of enactment of theHSWA amendments. The time the waste was originally disposed is irrelevantto this analysis; the status of wastes as listed hazardous wastes (andwastes derived from them as listed hazardous wastes) is determined by whatthe wastes are, not by when they were initially disposed (<T3>Chemical Waste Management</T3>, 869 F. 2d at 1536-37).To further clarify the applicability of the treatment standards to multi-sourceleachate, the Agency points out the following: (1) Groundwater contaminatedwith multi-source leachate must comply with the multi-source leachate standards(see e.g. <T3>Chemical Waste Management </T3>v.<T3> EPA, supra,</T3> 869 F.2d at 1539-40); (2) Single-source leachate(i.e., leachate derived-from only one waste code such as might be expectedfrom a monofill) cannot be combined to create multi-source leachate; and(3) Single-source leachate from separate facilities cannot be combinedto create multi-source leachate. These last two interpretive principlesare needed to prevent abuses that would forestall treatment of prohibitedwastes. <T3>b. Development of Proposed Treatment Standards. </T3>The Agency istoday proposing two options for applicability of BDAT treatment standardsfor multi-source leachate and residues from leachate treatment: (1) Continuedapplication of only those treatment standards for the waste codes thatwere land disposed; and (2) application of one fixed set of wastewatertreatment standards and one set of nonwastewater treatment standards forall multi-source leachate and treatment residues. These options are discussedlater in this preamble section. The Agency is specifically requesting commenton both of these options. For both options, the number of applicable concentration-based constituentstandards could be very large (i.e., there could be more than 200 individualconstituent concentrations that would have to be met). This is a consequenceof viewing multi-source leachate as its own treatability group; it thuspotentially contains any or all of the BDAT list constituents which consequentlymust be addressed in treatment standards. It is important to point outthat under either option, EPA envisions the rule being implemented by leavingthe frequency of monitoring for constituents (or indicator parameters)to the judgement of the permit writer, who would specify monitoring frequencyin the facility's waste analysis plan. (See further discussion of wasteanalysis plans in section III.A.1.f.(3.) of today's preamble). As withall BDAT treatment standards, this provides site-specific considerationof the need for monitoring regulated pollutants likely to be present. EPA is in the process of reviewing these constituents to determine if treatmentof the BDAT list of constituents will assure treatment of these other onehundred or so Appendix VIII constituents. If the BDAT list is not adequateas a surrogate for all constituents contained in multi-source leachate,a treatment train could also be specified to assure adequate treatmentof all codes. <T3>(1) Continued Application of Only Those Treatment Standards for theWaste Codes that were Land Disposed. </T3>The first option is to continueto apply the derived-from rule to multi-source leachate for only thosetreatment standards for the waste codes that were land disposed. As discussedearlier in this section, the derived-from rule would require that leachatemeet the standards set for the waste codes from which the leachate is derived.In previous rules, the Agency stated that these treatment standards couldbe appropriate because leachate is expected to be more dilute than theoriginal wastes on which the standards were based. At that time, the availablewaste characterization data for leachate indicated that the concentrationsof hazardous constituents in untreated leachate were slightly higher butvery similar to the concentrations of hazardous constituents that wouldmeet the promulgated treatment standards. Thus, the Agency concluded thatleachate is easier to treat than the original wastes and so could be treatedto comply with BDAT. Administrative complications can arise from applying these standards basedon the vast number of potentially applicable treatment standards and thevarious combinations and permutations of applicable treatment standards.This is further complicated if more than one standard exists for a particularconstituent, since the most stringent standard then applies (see andSection;268.41(b)).Because of the variety in potential applicable treatment standards dueto the wide variety of combinations of waste codes, the Agency cannot present,in today's preamble, all of the options of treatment standards that wouldapply for all combinations of wastes. EPA solicits comment regarding applicability of treatment standards thatare specified methods of treatment should the Agency decide to adopt thisoption in the final rule. The Agency's tentative resolution is that, forleachate wastewaters, any treatment standard that is a method should apply.This is because all of the specified treatment methods for wastewaters(typically wet air oxidation or chemical precipitation and filtration)are readily applicable wastewater treatment methods to which leachate wastewatersshould be amenable. The situation for leachate non-wastewaters, i.e. the residues from treatingleachate, is more complicated. The nonwastewater treatment methods thatEPA has specified most frequently are incineration to destroy organicsand chemical stabilization for inorganics. Since these are generally-applicabletreatment technologies (and form the basis for most of the numerical standardsin any case), EPA does not see any difficulty in applying these methods.EPA, however, has also required deactivation and recovery as methods forcertain wastes. These methods are less likely to be appropriate to leachatenonwastewaters. As a practical matter, however, EPA expects that the propertyof reactivity will be removed by treating the leachate itself, so thatthe treatment residue would never require deactivation. Thus, EPA is notproposing to require this treatment method for leachate nonwastewaters(should it ultimately adopt standards based on this option). EPA has specifiedor proposed recovery as a method for certain wastes that contain zinc,lead, or mercury (see section III.A.5. of today's preamble). These treatmentmethods are required for waste treatability groups that contain recoverableamounts of the target metal. For zinc in K061 wastes the percentage is15%; for lead in the D008 High Lead Subcategory, the percentage is greaterthan 2.5 %; for mercury in D009 High Mercury Subcategory, the concentrationis l6 mg/kg. EPA is proposing to apply these same thresholds to leachatenonwastewaters derived from wastes subject to these treatment methods.Should the leachate nonwastewater contain less than these concentrationsof the target metal, the concentration level based on stabilization wouldapply. (See also 54 FR 18836 (May 2, 1989) where the Agency adopted a similarapproach in revising certain of the no land disposal treatment standards.)<T3>(2) Establishing One Set of Wastewater Standards and NonwastewaterStandards for Multi-Source Leachate and Treatment Residues. </T3>The Agencyreceived several comments during the first third rulemaking alleging thatmulti-source leachate can be difficult to treat due to its complex wastematrix (i.e., each leachate and treatment residue has various combinationsand concentrations of different hazardous constituents). The commenterssuggested that multi-source leachate should be a specific treatabilitygroup with its own separate waste code, and that one set of treatment standards(i.e., one standard per constituent) should be established for this group.At that time, however, insufficient data were available to substantiatethat multi-source leachate and treatment residues constitute a separatetreatability group. Since the time this issue was first raised, the Agency has received dataon the physical and chemical composition of various multi-source leachatesand on current multi-source leachate treatment. These data were submittedfrom various TSDFs to show that multi-source leachate is more difficultto treat than EPA originally thought, and that it deserves classificationas a separate treatability group. The Agency is examining waste characterizationdata and some treatment data to determine the frequency that leachate (bothtreated and untreated) fails to achieve the existing treatment standards.The treatment data are from treatment systems that are currently beingapplied to leachate collected from several sources. These data are beingplaced in the administrative record for today's proposed rule and willbe considered in the promulgation of treatment standards for leachate.Based on a preliminary analysis of industry data and the various complicationsthat arise in applying the treatment standards to a seemingly endless arrayof waste combinations, the Agency is proposing, as one option, the applicabilityof one set of wastewater treatment standards and one set of nonwastewaterstandards for all multi-source leachates as a means of complying with thewaste code carry-through. Although this option may ease the burden of compliancefor those facilities land disposing numerous waste codes, it may increasethe burden for those facilities land disposing only a few waste codes,who, under this second option, would have to analyze for the entire BDATlist of constituents. (See the earlier solicitation of comment on redefiningmulti-source leachate as a means of dealing with this potential problem.)The Agency also is specifically requesting comment on the treatabilitydata submitted by industry that can be found in the administrative recordfor today's proposed rule. These data may be used by the Agency to developor to revise the proposed standards based on the second approach (althoughinitial indications are that these data do not come from optimized treatmentsystems). If any person desires a copy of any additional data pertainingto this proposed treatment standard that is received during the publiccomment period, please request it in writing by identifying the data ofinterest as III.A.7 Development of Treatment Standards for Multi-SourceLeachate. See section III.A.1.i. for more information on requesting data.<T3>c. Proposed Treatment Standards Based on Option Two. </T3>In today'snotice, EPA is proposing one set of nonwastewater and one set of wastewatertreatment standards based on the data currently available according tooption two discussed above. As noted previously, the final treatment standardsbased on this option will depend upon the analysis of additional treatmentdata received just prior to proposal (these data have been placed in theadministrative record for today's notice but have not yet been analyzedfor impact on the treatment standards proposed in this notice) and anyadditional data or comments received during the comment period. These treatment standards propose the regulation of the entire BDAT listof constituents. The reasoning behind this is that commenters have previouslystated that their multi-source leachate is typically derived from the landdisposal of every listed hazardous waste, and thus can potentially containany or all of the BDAT list constituents. More information on how thesestandards were developed can be found in sections of today's preamble andvarious background documents. The proposed wastewater and nonwastewatermulti-source leachate standards for option two are included in tables atthe end of this preamble section. It is EPA's tentative conclusion that establishing treatment standardsfor each BDAT constituent obviates the need to specify methods of treatment,should the Agency adopt this option. In other words, the BDAT list wouldserve as a surrogate for those constituents for which there are no analyticmethods. The Agency solicits comment on this point, and specifically requestsdocumentation of the validity of using the BDAT list as surrogates. <T3>(1) Nonwastewaters. </T3>The Agency is proposing to transfer most ofthe concentration-based nonwastewater standards for multi-source leachate(option two) based on a direct transfer of existing and proposed nonwastewatertreatment standards for the U and P waste codes that correspond to theproposed regulated constituents. For convenience of the reader, the Agencypresents a table at the end of this section entitled Basis of Transferfor Multi-Source Leachate Treatment Standards which gives the waste codefrom which the standard has been proposed to be transferred. This tablealso includes a reference to further discussion of the development of theproposed standard either in the administrative record, the preamble oftoday's notice, or the appropriate background document for that particularstandard. Almost all of the nonwastewater standards for organic constituents arebased on incineration as BDAT. These constituent concentrations are transferredfrom treatment standards for U and P waste codes promulgated in the SecondThird Rule or proposed in today's preamble. The metal constituent concentrations(except for arsenic, selenium and mercury) are primarily based on a transferof the performance achieved by stabilization for F006. <T3>(2) Wastewaters. </T3>Most of the concentration-based wastewater standardswere transferred from treatment data on those constituents developed forvarious other regulatory programs administered by the Agency, and are basedon data from numerous sources. (Since these data apply to the developmentof treatment standards for other wastewaters besides multi-source leachate,further discussion of these data is presented in section III.A.1.h.(6.)of today's notice.) Some of the treatment standards for wastewater formsof multi-source leachate have been transferred from other listed RCRA wastes.Details on the development or transfer of these wastewater standards perconstituent can be found in the administrative record for multi-sourceleachate. EPA also has recently conducted a study of the treatment of wastewatersby wet air oxidation followed by PACT or activated carbon. Subsequent tothis proposal, these data will be examined for applicability to wastewaterconstituents in multi-source leachate. In the interim, these data can befound in the administrative record for today's proposed rule. EPA specificallysolicits comment on the appropriate use of these data in establishing standardsfor leachate. <T3>d. Multi-Source Leachate That Exhibits a Characteristic of HazardousWastes. </T3>EPA is not proposing separate standards under option 2 formulti-source leachate that exhibits a characteristic of hazardous wastes.This is because, by proposing standards for all of the BDAT list constituents,the treatment standards will address all of the constituents and propertiesthat the treatment standard for characteristics address. As described morefully in section III.C below, the Agency's proposed resolution of situationswhere prohibited listed wastes also exhibit a characteristic is that thespecific treatment standard for the listed waste would control becauseit is more specific. As stated further in that section, however, shouldmulti-source leachate or its treatment residues exhibit a characteristicat the point of disposal, it would have to be treated to meet the treatmentstandard for that characteristic. Under option 1, if multi-source leachate exhibited a characteristic, onewould have to ascertain if the treatment standard for the listed wastesfrom which the leachate is derived addressed the same constituents or propertiesidentified by the characteristic. If so, the treatment standard for thelisted waste would supercede the standard for the characteristic. If not,the leachate and/or treatment residues would have to be treated to meetthe treatment standard for both the listed wastes and the characteristic.See section III.C. This same result would obtain for single source leachatethat exhibits a characteristic. Finally, if leachate simply exhibits a characteristic of hazardous wastewithout being derived from a listed waste, it is subject to the treatmentstandard for that characteristic. <T3>e. Multi-Source Leachate Containing Dioxins and Furans. </T3>A finalset of issues pertaining to multi-source leachate involves the status ofmulti-source leachate that contains chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans(``dioxins'' and ``furans''). Specific points for discussion are applicabilityof the waste code carry-through principle where the leachate may be derivedin part from treatment, storage, or disposal of listed dioxin-containingwastes, applicability of the dioxin land disposal prohibitions, applicabilityof management standards for acute hazardous wastes, and a need for treatmentstandards for dioxins and furans. The most recent characterization data for multi-source leachate indicatespresence of dioxins at low concentration levels. These data are gatheredfrom several very large commercial facilities that treat a great numberof different wastes: these data should thus be representative of the majorityof leachate that may be generated. Based on a review of waste characterizationdata for fifteen different sources of untreated multi-source leachate,only two data points indicated detectable concentrations of dioxins (basedon a range of detection limits of 0.0001 ppb to 0.01 ppb): concentrationsof 0.031 ppb tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in one sample, and .026 ppb pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxinin another sample (TCDD equivalence: .013 ppb, based on a Toxic EquivalenceFactor of 0.5, see 51 FR 19661, June 3, 1986). All other samples showednondetectable levels for hexa-, penta-, and tetra-chlorodibenzo-furansand dioxins. (It is not known if any of the leachates tested derived inpart from disposal of listed dioxin-containing wastes.)These concentration levels are very low, and below the level the Agencybelieves warrants the special concerns which prompted special managementstandards for the F021-F023 and F025-F028 wastes, and which prompted Congressto prioritize the dioxin waste land disposal prohibitions (see 51 FR 19859,June 3, 1986). Based on these data, EPA is proposing that the dioxin wastecodes not apply to multi-source leachate. Thus, the leachate would remaina hazardous waste but would not be classified under these waste codes.These waste codes trigger extraordinary regulatory and nonregulatory burdensin the form of extra management standards (50 FR 1978, January 17, 1985),permitting obstacles due to public perceptions, extra management costs,and prioritized land disposal prohibitions. These extraordinary consequencesshould be reserved for situations where the concentrations of dioxin meritthe need for extraordinary controls. This does not appear to be the casefor multi-source leachate. (EPA notes that the derived-from rule does notbar the type of reclassification that we are proposing here. The derived-fromrule, and the interpretive waste-code carry through principle, establishpresumptions that can be rebutted either by an individual party, or bythe Agency. Indeed, EPA itself indicated in the original dioxin waste listingregulation that not all wastes derived from managing the listed dioxin-containingwastes are acute hazardous. EPA thus listed waste F028, which is a residuefrom treating listed dioxin-containing wastes, as a toxic hazardous wasteunder its own waste code.) However, to guard against situations where leachate might have higherconcentrations of dioxins and furans as a result of management of the listeddioxin-containing wastes (the only circumstance under the existing ruleswhen presence of dioxins would trigger acute hazardous waste status forthe leachate), EPA is proposing that leachate that is derived from anyor all of the listed dioxin-containing wastes (F021-F023 and F025-F028)and no other hazardous waste continue to be classified as multi-sourceeven if it was derived exclusively from these dioxin-containing wastes,provided more than one was involved. A consequence of the proposal is rescheduling to the Third multi-sourceleachate that could have been classified under the dioxin waste code. EPAdoes not see a legal impediment to this action. As the Agency determinedwith respect to multi-source leachate that contains listed solvent wastes,EPA does not believe that either the solvent or dioxin statutory prohibitions(RCRA section 3004(e)) are so definite as to the prohibition effectivedate for multi-source leachate not directly attributable to disposal ofa particular solvent or dioxin that the Agency is without discretion todetermine an alternative prohibition effective date (see 54 FR 8265, February27, 1989). Rather, the Agency sees some ambiguity in the classificationof multi-source leachate and thus some discretion to reschedule. Becauseexisting data show that the levels of dioxins and furans are so low ornondetectable, EPA does not presently believe it would be appropriate toclassify those multi-source leachates that technically are derived in partfrom disposal of the listed dioxin-containing waste codes under the dioxinwaste prohibition. For the same reasons, imposition of the special standards for acute hazardouswastes do not appear appropriate for multi-source leachate. Indeed, EPAhas already made determinations (or proposed them) that comparable levelsof dioxins are not properly classifiable as acute hazardous wastes (see51 FR 30271 (July 25, 1985); 53 FR 7903 (March 11, 1988); 53 FR 20103 (June2, 1988); 54 FR 27167 (June 28, 1989)).The final issue is whether the treatment standards for multi-source leachateshould include a treatment standard for dioxins and furans. The Agencyis proposing a treatment standard of 1 ppb in the waste, the routinelyachievable analytical detection limit. However, it may be that there isno need for a dioxin standard (or a standard for many of the other BDATlist constituents) if control of other constituents will also control thedioxins and furans. Given the apparent low level of dioxins and furansin the untreated leachate, these would appear to be possible candidatesfor indicator pollutant status since most of the samples could meet thetreatment standard even as generated. EPA notes, however, that the issueof indicator pollutants for multi-source leachate treatment standards isnot unique to dioxin and potentially includes any of the BDAT list pollutants.EPA accordingly solicits comment on this issue not only for dioxins andfurans, but as part of the general issue. EPA also solicits comment onthe other issues discussed in this part of the preamble, including anymore raw leachate characterization data that may be available.<T3>f. Separate Waste Code for Multi-Source Leachate. </T3>EPA also solicitscomment on one remaining issue: whether multi-source leachate should beredesignated by a separate waste code. This issue is not necessarily relatedto the question of the treatment standards that should apply to multi-sourceleachate, since EPA could still determine that the treatment standardsproposed under either option 1 or option 2 could apply to multi-sourceleachate (although, should the Agency adopt an approach based on option1_carry through of treatment standards_then waste generators and treatmentfacilities probably could comply with andSection;268.7 (a) and (b) only bylisting numerical treatment standards on the land disposal prohibitiontracking document). Members of the commercial waste management industryhave urged the Agency to establish a separate waste code for multi-sourceleachate on the grounds that it is a distinct type of waste different fromthe underlying wastes from which it is derived. In addition, they assertthat they will face fewer administrative obstacles, particularly with respectto permit modifications if multi-source leachate and treatment residueshave a separate waste code.EPA solicits comment on this approach, provided it is understood that adecision on this issue does not determine what the treatment standard(s)for multi-source leachate and treatment residues should be. In addition,EPA solicits comment on the possible effect on RCRA permitting of designatingmulti-source leachate (and treatment residues derived therefrom) by a separatewaste code. It would appear that this necessitates amending all RCRA permitsthat do not already include a narrative description for leachate and leachatetreatment residues. EPA also solicits comment on whether designating multi-sourceleachate by a single waste code should be considered a HSWA regulationimmediately effective in authorized states.<ITAG

Clarification of Applicability of Treatment Standards to Soil andDebris.</T3> Soil and debris contaminated with wastes subject to the landdisposal restrictions are likewise subject to the restrictions. Contaminatedsoil and debris must meet the promulgated treatment standards for the contaminatinghazardous wastes prior to land disposal.The Agency realizes, however, there are certain problems associated withregulating hazardous wastes in soil and debris matrices. It is often difficultto determine the level of contaminant concentrations found in soil anddebris because it may be difficult to obtain a representative sample ofthe waste. Another problem is posed by the wide variety of soil and debristhat could be subject to the land disposal restrictions. In the case ofdebris, the size ranges from clay-sized particles to large contaminatedtanks and buildings. Therefore, a separate rulemaking is being preparedthat will establish treatability groups and treatment standards for contaminatedsoil and debris. Until contaminated soil and debris can be better organized into treatabilitygroups, alternate treatment standards for these wastes can be establishedas a site-specific variance from the treatment standards (see 53 FR 3122l,August 17, 1988). Categorizing such waste according to type, volume, form,and contaminant concentration poses several problems best resolved on asite-specific basis. To be granted a site-specific variance from the treatmentstandard, the petitioner must demonstrate that because the physical (orchemical) properties of the waste differ significantly from the waste analyzedin developing the treatment standard, the waste cannot be treated to specifiedlevels or by the specified methods.A particularly difficult problem arises with respect to scrap metal contaminatedwith some listed wastes. When BDAT standards for these listed wastes limitmetal concentrations to relatively low leachable levels based on stabilization,it can be infeasible to achieve these standards, in some cases, due tothe presence of metals scrap in the waste mixture. Therefore, EPA solicitscomment as to whether these scrap metal/listed waste mixtures should beexempt from BDAT standards associated with the listed wastes for metalcontained in the scrap prior to contamination with the listed waste. Anycomments supporting this approach should address the obvious difficultiesin demonstrating which metals were present (and at what concentrations)in the uncontaminated scrap. We also solicit comment on whether the definitionof scrap in 40 CFR 261.1 provides an adequate basis for the purposes ofthis exemption. EPA wishes to emphasize that, under this scenario, the contaminated scrapmetal would remain a listed hazardous waste for the purposes of other SubtitleC requirements. In addition, any such scrap/listed waste mixture that exhibitsa hazardous characteristic (such as EP toxicity) would be subject to theBDAT standards for those characteristic wastes. We also believe that thedilution prohibition properly extends to this situation. Unless EPA requiresthat the exemption applies only scrap unavoidably contaminated with listedwaste (such as materials generated by remedial clean-ups or discarded treatmentequipment that contained the waste), there would be an obvious incentiveto mix scrap with listed wastes that have BDAT metal standards to avoidthe need to comply with those standards. Therefore, EPA intends to restrictthe exemption to scrap metal that (1) has been unavoidably contaminatedand (2) has had all listed waste removed by rinsing or other demonstrateddecontamination techniques. EPA requests comment on whether it should, in the near term, establishspecific measures for ``unavoidably contaminated'' and ``all listed wasteremoved''. We think that these concepts will prove difficult to establishin the near term, and, therefore, expect to leave these determinationsto permit writers to establish on a site-specific basis in waste analysisplans. In the longer term, however, EPA will be developing BDAT standardsfor contaminated soil and debris that may well establish the proper methodsof decontamination. Because of an apparent need to resolve this issue ona rapid basis to avoid impacting needed remedial cleanups and correctiveactions, EPA today is rescheduling the F006, F007, F008, F009, F010, F011,and F012 standards for cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel, and silver to the``third third''. This rescheduling applies only to scrap which has beendetermined to be unavoidably contaminated and to no longer contain listedwaste. Because of the urgent need for action and specific statutory languageexempting such decisions from review, we do not intend to solicit commenton the rescheduling and, instead, are making the action effective today.The effect of this rescheduling is to provide temporary relief for thesewastes while EPA considers the comments on these issues.<T3>9. Treatment Standards for Lab Packs.</T3> The Agency received severalcomments in response to the Second Third proposed rule on the regulatorystatus of lab packs. The commenters stated that lab packs are typicallyused by industry to dispose of small quantities of commercial chemicalproducts (U and P wastes) and analytical samples that may contain F andK wastes. These lab packs may contain hundreds of restricted wastes, andthe applicable treatment standards (or soft hammer requirements until May8, 1990) must be achieved for each waste code contained in the lab pack.The commenters stated that these requirements pose an administrative burdenthat is incommensurate with the amount of waste land disposed. In the Second Third final rule (54 FR 26594), the Agency restated its positionthat all restricted wastes placed in lab packs and land disposed must complywith the land disposal restrictions. However, the Agency solicited comments,data, and specific suggestions to support treatment options for lab packs.The Agency is today proposing an approach for lab packs that establishesalternate treatment standards expressed as technologies for those lab packsmeeting certain criteria. Lab packs that do not meet these criteria mustmeet the applicable treatment standard for each waste contained in thelab pack. The Agency notes that the proposed approach would not be mandatoryand that generators of lab packs who wish to comply with the current implementationof the land disposal restrictions regulatory framework as it appIies tolab packs would be free to do so. The approach proposed in today's rule establishes incineration as the alternatetreatment standard for lab packs containing certain characteristic wasteand listed organic hazardous waste codes only, and stabilization for labpacks containing certain EP toxic metals only. The Agency has developedappendices to 40 CFR part 268 for the purpose of identifying waste codesand constituents to which the alternate treatment standards are applicable.Appendix IV to part 268 identifies waste codes that may be included inan ``organic lab pack.'' Appendix V to part 268 lists inorganic constituentsthat may be included in an ``inorganic lab pack.'' Where lab packs containorganic or inorganic waste other than those specified in Appendix IV orV (including non-hazardous waste), or where organic and inorganic wastesare commingled in a lab pack, the treatment standards and other restrictionsfor each waste code in the lab pack must be achieved. The Agency believes its proposed approach, although narrowly defined, providessome administrative relief sought by the commenters. It simplifies themanagement system for these wastes because owners/operators will not berequired to analyze the treatment residue for compliance with individualtreatment standards. However, generators must continue to list each wastecode contained in the lab pack on the notification form according to therequirements of andSection; 268.7. Lab packs that are treated by the specifiedtechnology may be disposed of in Subtitle C facilities without furthertesting or analysis. Agency data indicate that organic constituents can be effectively destroyedby incineration in well-designed, well-operated incinerators that meetthe requirements of part 264 or 265 subpart O. For example, treatment standardsfor most solvents, dioxins, California list halogenated organic compounds(HOCs), and First, Second, and Third Third organic wastes are expressedas a numerical standard derived from incineration of the waste. In somecases, the treatment standard is specified as incineration (e.g., for mostCalifornia list HOCs). Although the Agency lacks specific treatabilitydata for lab packs containing organic waste, it believes that incinerationof organic lab pack waste will significantly reduce the risks posed byland disposal, and simplify the management of these small volume wastes.Therefore, the Agency is proposing to specify incineration as the treatmentstandard for lab packs containing these wastes. The Agency is limiting the applicability of this alternate standard fororganics to wastes that have a promulgated or proposed treatment standardbased on the performance of incineration, or where incineration only isspecified as the treatment standard. Appendix IV to part 268 contains alist of F, K, P, and U wastes and characteristic wastes that meet thesecriteria. These wastes must be incinerated in accordance with the requirementsof part 264 subpart O and part 265 subpart O. Ignitable and corrosive wastesmay be included in the ``organic lab pack'' provided they comply with therequirements for incompatible wastes in andSection; 264.316(d) or 265.316(d).Reactive wastes are excluded from placement in the organic lab pack. Thesewastes remain subject to the applicable treatment standards. The Agency is proposing to include California list PCBs and dioxin-containingwaste (F020-F023, F026-F028) in the ``organic lab pack'' treatability group,but emphasizes that treatment of these wastes requires more stringent performancestandards than wastes included in part 268 Appendix IV (i.e., dioxins mustachieve a destruction and removal efficiency of 99.9999 percent and PCBsmust meet the technical standards in 40 CFR 761.70). Where generators chooseto commingle one or both of these wastes with ``organic lab pack'' wastelisted in Appendix IV, the entire lab pack must be incinerated to meetthe more stringent standard. For example, a lab pack containing dioxin-containingwaste, California list PCBs, and Appendix IV waste must be incineratedaccording to the technical standards of 40 CFR 761.70 and the applicablerequirements of parts 264, 265, and 266 (including all applicable performancestandards for dioxin-containing waste). The Agency recognizes that generators may also dispose of inorganic (metals-bearing)wastes in lab packs. Therefore, the Agency is proposing an alternate treatmentstandard of stabilization for the following EP toxic metals listed in AppendixV to part 268: barium, cadmium, lead, silver, and trivalent chromium. TheAgency believes that stabilization of these metals that are removed fromthe vials and lab packs can be accomplished using Portland cement in a20 percent binder-to-waste ratio (by weight). The Agency believes thisto be a demonstrated and available technology for these constituents. TheAgency would like to allow other stabilizing agents that are ``equivalent''to Portland cement to also be used, but has been unable to develop a methodof demonstrating equivalence that does not involve review and approval.The Agency is soliciting suggestions for demonstrating such equivalence.The Agency, therefore, is proposing a treatment standard of stabilization(i.e., the wastes must be removed from the containers and stabilized),performed in the manner described above, for lab packs containing onlythose inorganic constituents specified in Appendix V to part 268 (i.e.,``inorganic lab packs''). In cases where non-hazardous wastes are commingled with Appendix V inorganicconstituents prior to stabilization, the lab pack is ineligible for thealternate treatment standard due to possible interferences caused by thesenon-hazardous constituents. The alternate treatment standard for ``inorganiclab packs'' is not applicable where generators or owners/operators commingle``inorganic lab pack'' waste with wastes listed in part 268 Appendix IV,dioxin-containing waste, PCBs, or other wastes. The Agency is not establishing an alternate treatment standard expressedas a specified technology for lab packs containing the remaining EP toxicmetals (i.e., arsenic, selenium, mercury, and hexavalent chromium) becauseof concern regarding the successful stabilization of these inorganic constituents.Agency data indicate that there is difficulty in stabilizing these constituents,and a TCLP analysis is necessary to verify the results. In cases wherethe Agency specifies a technology as the treatment standard, however, treatmentusing the specified technology satisfies the land disposal restrictionrequirements, and analysis of the treatment residues is not required. Consequently,lab packs containing constituents other than those specified in AppendixV to part 268 must comply with the treatment standards for each of therestricted wastes included in the lab pack. The Agency's proposed alternate treatment standards for lab packs appliesonly if the following conditions are met: (1) The lab pack contains only organic hazardous waste codes, the wastecodes are listed in Appendix IV to part 268, and the ``organic lab pack''is incinerated according to the provisions in part 264 or 265 subpart O;or (2) The lab pack contains only inorganic constituents listed in AppendixV to part 268, and the ``inorganic lab pack'' is stabilized with Portlandcement in a 20 percent binder-to-waste ratio by weight. Again, the Agencyis aware that equivalent technologies to Portland cement stabilizationexist. Therefore, the Agency is soliciting comment on methods for establishingequivalency that are short of establishing a variance procedure.Lab packs that contain PCBs or dioxin-containing wastes must continue tomeet the applicable treatment standards for these wastes. Examples areprovided for clarification: (1) A lab pack that contains only dioxin-containing waste (F020-23 andF026-28) <T3>or</T3> a mixture of dioxin-containing waste and organic hazardouswaste codes listed in Appendix IV to part 268 must be incinerated accordingto the provisions in part 264 or 265 subpart O (including the applicableperformance standards for dioxin-containing waste). (2) A lab pack containing California list PCBs and dioxin-containing wastemust be incinerated according to the technical standards of 40 CFR 761.70and the applicable standards of parts 264, 265, and 266 (including theperformance standards for dioxin-containing waste). Generators or owners/operators who dispose of hazardous organic waste accordingto the provisions in today's proposed rule must also meet the requirementsfor lab packs specified in andSection;andSection; 264.316 and 265.316, whicheveris applicable. Such persons must also comply with the notification, certification,and recordkeeping requirements of andSection; 268.7. The Agency is continuingto require generators to list each hazardous waste code on the notificationform according to the requirements in andSection; 268.7. The Agency is alsoproposing to require generators to certify that organic and inorganic labpacks destined for treatment as described in today's notice contain onlythe applicable waste codes or constituents listed in Appendix IV or AppendixV, whichever is applicable. The Agency emphasizes that lab packs containingwastes other than those listed in Appendix IV or Appendix V to part 268,including nonhazardous wastes, are excluded from the alternate treatmentstandards for lab packs proposed in today's rule.The Agency is requesting comments on all aspects of its proposed approachfor lab packs. <ITAG tagnum="84">III.B Capacity Determinations</ITAG>1. Determination of Alternative Capacity and Effective Dates for SurfaceLand-Disposed Wastes <ITAG tagnum="81">a. Total Quantity of Land-Disposed Wastes </ITAG>The capacity analyses for wastes for which EPA is today proposing treatmentstandards were conducted using the National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment,Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Facilities (the TSDR Survey). EPA conductedthe TSDR Survey during 1987 and early 1988 to obtain comprehensive dataon the nation's capacity for managing hazardous waste and on the volumesof hazardous waste being disposed of in or on the land (i.e., land disposal).Survey data are part of the record for this proposed rule. Other major sources of data include the National Survey of Hazardous WasteGenerators, conducted by EPA during 1988 and 1989. It includes data onwaste generation, waste characterization, and hazardous waste treatmentcapacity in units exempt from RCRA permitting. These data are used to supportthis proposal and are part of the record for this proposed rule. For mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes, EPA has used data supplied by the U.S.Department of Energy. State and State compact low-level radioactive wastesurvey data were also used, as were data summaries in several overviewreports on mixed radioactive waste. The various land disposal methods used in 1986 and the quantities of wastethey handled (excluding mixed radioactive wastes) are presented in TableIII.B.1.(a). The data indicated that about 5,566 million gallons of thewastes for which standards are proposed today were disposed of in or onthe land. This estimate includes less than 1 million gallons of wastesthat were stored in surface impoundments and 76 million that were storedin waste piles. These stored wastes will eventually be treated, recycled,or permanently disposed of in other units. To avoid double counting, thevolumes of wastes reported as being stored in surface impoundments or wastepiles have not been included in the volumes of wastes requiring alternativetreatment. Furthermore, this rule proposes prohibitions on the placementof wastes affected by this rule in waste piles or surface impoundmentsfor storage. EPA estimates that about 11 million gallons of treatment residuals fromminimum technology impoundments or from impoundments that were replacedby a tank (e.g., standard cement, steel tanks, or filter presses) willrequire alternative treatment. EPA assumes that this waste is now beingsent off-site for treatment. Consequently, this amount is included as treatmentcapacity required in today's rule. In addition, 29 million gallons of wastes were treated in waste piles,20 million gallons were disposed of in surface impoundments, 246 milliongallons were disposed of in land treatment units or landfills, and 5,184million gallons were injected underground. All of these wastes will requirealternative treatment capacity. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,6 </C><T4>Table III.B.</T4>1.(a) <T4>Volume of Wastes by Land Disposal Method for Which Standards Are BeingProposed </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Millions of gallons/year] </ITAG><H1>Land disposal method </H1><H1>Volume</H1> Storage: <ITAG tagnum="3">Waste piles </ITAG><D>76 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Surface impoundments </ITAG><D>andless;1 </D>Treatment: <ITAG tagnum="3">Waste piles </ITAG><D>29 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Surface impoundments </ITAG><D>11 </D>Disposal: <ITAG tagnum="3">Landfills </ITAG><D>240 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Land treatment </ITAG><D>6 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Surface impoundments </ITAG><D>20 </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Underground injected </ITAG><D>5,184</D><R>n,s</R><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>5,566</D></ITAG></ITAG>EPA notes, however, that the TSDR survey may overstate demand for treatmentcapacity for wastewaters that were treated or disposed in surface impoundmentsat the time of the survey (1987 and early 1988). This is because such impoundmentsmust now be retrofitted to meet minimum technology requirements, or takenout of service, as a result of RCRA section 3005(j). If the impoundmentcontinues to operate after being retrofitted, it would be a section 3005(j)(11)impoundment if the wastewaters are treated and residues are removed annually.Wastewaters that are not treated or disposed in surface disposal units,or that are treated in section 3005(j)(11) impoundments, do not createany demand for alternative treatment capacity. Thus, the Agency solicitscomment on what wastewaters currently disposed of in surface units do requirealternative treatment capacity. Based on the above analysis, EPA believesthat the volume is low and that, as a result, no capacity variance ordinarilyis required for wastewaters destined for surface disposal. (This discussionobviously does not apply for wastewaters destined for deepwell disposal.)There is one exception to the discussion in the preceding paragraph. Thisinvolves wastewaters that exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste butthat are diluted before they reach surface disposal units. As discussedin detail in section III.C below, EPA believes that such dilution normallyis impermissible (although the Agency is soliciting comment on the issue).As a result, these wastes may require alternative treatment capacity andthe volumes of these wastes would likely not be reflected in the TSDR survey(because the waste would not exhibit a characteristic by the time it reachesa surface disposal unit). EPA solicits comment on the volumes of wastespotentially affected by this interpretation and whether a national capacityvariance would be required for such wastes. (Readers should be aware, however,of potential implications of the California list prohibitions for characteristicwastes receiving a national capacity variance. See the discussion in sectionIII.M below.)EPA is also requesting comments on the quantity of P and U RCRA waste codescurrently being disposed of in deepwells. The TSDR Survey data includesome large volume waste streams containing P and U RCRA codes. However,P and U wastes are by definition discarded off-specification products orresidues and are usually generated in small volumes. Facilities disposingof these large volume waste streams in deepwells have indicated that smallvolumes of U and P wastes were mixed with large volumes of other wastes.However, the facilities were not able to provide a specific volume forthe deepwell-disposed P and U wastes. Since the facilities generally describedthe volume of U and P wastes deepwell-disposed as ``very small'', EPA hasassumed for the analysis of alternative treatment capacity that the volumeof P and U wastes needing alternative capacity is less than 100,000 gallons;therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant a national variance to P and Uwastes that are deepwell-disposed. EPA requests information of the generationand management of P and U wastes, especially on the disposal of P and Uwastes in deepwells. EPA also requests comments on the assumption thatthe volume of P and U wastes being deepwell-disposed are less than l00,000gallons.The following sections provide a summary of the capacity analysis for theproposed rule; the detailed analyses are presented in the background document,and all data are included in the public docket.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Required Alternative Capacity for Surface Land-Disposed Wastes</ITAG>EPA assessed the requirements resulting from today's proposed rule foralternative treatment capacity for surface land-disposed wastes. Usingprimarily the TSDR and Generator Survey data, EPA first characterized thevolumes of wastes for which treatment standards are being established.Waste streams were characterized on the basis of land disposal method,waste code, physical and chemical form, and waste characterization data.Using this information, EPA placed the wastes in treatability groups identifyingapplicable treatment technologies. The waste volume were then summed bytreatability group to determine the amount and type of alternative treatmentcapacity that would be required when owners or operators comply with theland disposal restrictions being proposed today.Based on this analysis, EPA estimates that today's proposal could affectabout 5,556 million gallons of wastes that are landdisposed annually. Thistotal includes wastes that were stored only, that already meet BDAT, orthat can be treated on-site. Consequently, only about 5,411 million gallonswill require alternative treatment capacity. Of this total, 266 milliongallons were surface-disposed (i.e., excluding underground injection),and the remaining 5,184 million gallons were underground injected. (Seesection 2 for determinations of alternative capacity and effective datesfor wastes injected underground.) EPA estimates that treatment of thesewastes will generate approximately 48 million gallons of residuals requiringtreatment before land disposal. In addition, EPA realizes that petroleum-refining wastes (K048, K049, K050,K051, and K052 wastes) will increase demand for capacity. The two-yearcapacity variance that was granted to petroleum refining wastes in theFirst Third rule will expire on August 8, 1990, three months after thepromulgation of the Third Third rule. The best demonstrated available technology(BDAT) standard for these wastes is based on sludge incineration followedby stabilization of the ash, or on solvent extraction and stabilizationof the residuals. EPA anticipates that available capacity for these technologiesmay be insufficient for handling the total volume of K048-K052 land-disposedwastes. Thus, EPA is requesting comments on current generation and managementpractices, industries' plans for treating and disposing of K048-K052 wastes,and the quantities of K048-K052 wastes disposed of based on current andplanned management practices. EPA will analyze this information to estimatethe impact of K048-K052 wastes on available capacity after August 8, 1990.The volumes of surface-disposed wastes that require alternative commercialtreatment and/or recycling capacity are presented in Table III.B.1.(b).This table does not include wastes that can be treated on-site by the generator,nor does it contain volumes of mixed radioactive wastes. As explained in section III.A of this preamble, EPA is proposing treatmentstandards expressed either as concentration limits based on the performanceof the BDAT, or as a specific treatment technology. When a treatment standardis expressed as a concentration limit, a specific treatment method is notrequired to achieve that concentration level. However, the BDAT (and technologiesthat EPA finds perform comparably), as discussed in section III.A., wereused as the basis for determining available capacity. When the treatmentstandard is expressed as a specific technology (rather than a concentrationlimit), that technology must be used.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>Table III.B.1.(b) <T4>Required Alternative

facilities.The data enable EPA to identify specific BDAT treatment (and treatmentthat EPA has determined performs comparably) in its assessment of bothoff-site and on site capacity. Therefore, EPA believes that the capacityidentified as available for a specific treatment technology will be capableof meeting the BDAT standard, which has been developed such that a well-designedand well-operated BDAT treatment process should be capable of meeting it.EPA is concerned that there may be insufficient incineration capacity totreat the sludge and solid hazardous wastes that must be incinerated tomeet BDAT standards. To establish criteria for differentiating betweena liquid and a solid waste as it pertains to the adequacy of existing incinerationcapacity, EPA examined the way in which these materials are fed into combustionsystems. Solids are typically fed in a containerized form or through anauger system. Liquids are atomized and fed through burners or nozzles (sometimesreferred to as feed guns). Some facilities burn sludges that are not handledas either solids or liquids in the conventional feed mechanisms mentionedabove. Sludges are typically fed to an incinerator by pumping them througha lance (i.e., essentially an open-ended pipe). EPA considers sludges to be solids in the context of the adequacy of existingincineration capacity. Sludges are pumpable but generally not atomizable.As such, the key to differentiating between solid and liquid feed materialsis whether or not the feed material can be atomized. The Agency believes that viscosity of the waste can be used to determineif it can be atomized. Wastes with a viscosity of greater than 1500 to2500 centipoise are generally considered too viscous to be atomized. Giventhat a waste with high viscosity can be blended with a waste with low viscosityso that the mixture can be atomized, the Agency is proposing a viscosityrepresenting the high end of the range_2500 centipoise_to identify ``non-liquid''waste (i.e., wastes that cannot be atomized). The Agency considered other criteria for distinguishing between liquidand solid wastes with respect to how wastes are fed into incinerators.Criteria such as solids content, particle size, and salt content of thewaste were considered but ultimately rejected. Although the Agency recognizesthat these waste parameters are important factors in incinerator designand operation, we believe that viscosity alone is an adequate parameterfor the purpose at hand. EPA requests comments on this approach for differentiatingbetween a liquid and a solid waste as it pertains to the adequacy of existingincineration capacity. With respect to variances based on lack of solids incineration capacity,EPA is only proposing to grant national capacity variances for <T3>non-atomizable</T3> solids (as defined above). Thus, for this purpose,EPA is proposing to further subcategorize the wastewater and nonwastewatertreatability groups that are used as the basis for treatment standards.Only the nonatomizable nonwastewaters would receive the variance. Thisis because (for most waste codes) there is ample treatment capacity inliquid injection furnaces, and in boilers and industrial furnaces, foratomizable nonwastewaters. EPA realizes that this approach is differentfrom and more sophisticated than that utilized in previous rulemakings.However, there is clearly no reason to grant national capacity varianceswhen EPA can define a reasonable subcategory for prohibited wastes forwhich there exists treatment capacity.<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Capacity Currently Available and Effective Dates </ITAG>Table III.B.1.(c) presents an estimate of the volumes of wastes that willrequire alternative treatment before land disposal to comply with the standardsproposed today. The amount of capacity that is available at commercialfacilities in each case is also presented. Available capacity is equalto the specific treatment system's maximum capacity minus the amount usedin 1986; available capacity was calculated using the TSDR Survey data.In addition, the available capacity presented in this section was adjustedto account for wastes previously restricted from land disposal by subtractingthe capacity required for land-disposed solvent wastes, First Third wastes,and Second Third wastes. In general, Table III.B.1.(c) indicates that there is inadequate capacityfor certain technologies: combustion of sludges and solids, mercury retorting,therma1 recovery, vitrification, and wet-air oxidation.

However, thereis adequate capacity for all other wastes needing combustion of sludgesand solids. For mercury retorting, there is not adequate capacity for D009,K071, K106, and U151. However there is adequate capacity for other wastesneeding this technology. Also, for wet-air oxidation, there is not enoughcapacity for F019, but there is adequate capacity for other wastes needingthis technology.It is important to note that some of the wastes, because of their actualphysical form, cannot be treated to meet standards simply by using thetechnology identified as BDAT. These wastes must be treated through severalsteps, called a treatment train. EPA assumes that the resultant residualswill also need to be treated using alternative technologies before landdisposal; therefore, the total volumes reported were assigned to appropriatetechnologies.The following sections discuss the results of the individual capacity analysesand effective dates for each waste code included in today's proposal. TableIII.B.1.(d) summarizes all the surface-disposed wastes for which EPA isproposing to grant a two-year variance.

For U141, U155, U187, and U203,EPA is proposing BDAT treatment standards based on the performance of incinerationfor wastewaters and nonwastewaters. Sufficient capacity exists for treatmentof these nonhalogenated organic wastes; therefore, EPA is not proposingto grant a national capacity variance for these wastes.(3) Ignitable, corrosive, and reactive characteristic wastes, and reactiveU and P wastes. This group includes ignitable characteristic wastes (D001),corrosive characteristic wastes (D002), reactive characteristic wastes(D003), and potentially reactive P and U wastes.(a) <T3>Ignitable Characteristic Wastes (D001). </T3>EPA has identified fourtreatability groups for D001 wastes: ignitable liquids, ignitable reactives,oxidizers, and ignitable gases. For ignitable liquids, EPA is proposingincineration, fuel substitution, or recovery as a method of treatment,rather than proposing numerical standards. EPA believes that the majorityof these wastes are already being either incinerated or reused as fuelor recovered for reuse. Sufficient treatment capacity exists for the D001ignitable liquid wastes destined for surface disposal; therefore, no capacityvariance is being proposed for them.EPA notes, that there may be inadequate treatment capacity for these ignitableliquid wastes if fuel substitution capacity were not considered. Sinceit makes environmental sense for ignitable wastes to be used as fuel substitutes,since final boiler and furnace RCRA air emission permit standards shouldbe in place relatively soon (standards were re-proposed on October 26,1989), since ignitable wastes are likely to be destroyed in such units,and because the Agency believes it is important not to grant a nationalcapacity variance for this waste treatability group (during which timethe wastes would most likely be used as fuel substitutes anyway, or beland-disposed), EPA believes it preferable to include fuel substitutionas a method of treatment for these wastes.However, significant volumes of D001 sludges and solids are being surface-disposed.These wastes would require incineration or reuse as fuel. Presently, EPAbelieves that adequate capacity does not exist for them. Therefore, EPAis proposing to grant a two-year national capacity variance only to thesubcategory of D001 sludges and solids (which is defined as having a viscosityof greater than 2,500 centipoise) requiring incineration or reuse as fuel.Planned capacity could possibly become available by May 1990 for D001 ignitablewastes. If planned facilities become operational by May 1990, there maybe adequate capacity for these wastes and a variance would not be needed.EPA requests comments on the need for and availability capacity for incinerationof non-atomizable sludges and solids as well as comments on the use ofa subcategory of D001 waste based on viscosity as the basis for grantinga national capacity variance.EPA is proposing deactivation as a method of treatment for D001 ignitablereactives and oxidizers. EPA has determined that sufficient capacity existsfor these wastes; therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant a national capacityvariance for them.For D001 ignitable gases, EPA is proposing recovery or incineration ofvented ignitable gases as a method of treatment. EPA believes that adequatecapacity exists for this waste form; therefore, EPA is not proposing anational capacity variance for this waste. (b) <T3>Corrosive Characteristic Wastes (D002). </T3>EPA has identified threetreatability groups for D002 wastes: acids, alkalines, and other corrosives.For the acid and alkaline subcategories, EPA is proposing neutralizationas a method of treatment. These wastes must be treated with chemicals andneutralized into an insoluble salt. However, EPA is also considering theuse of recovery of acids for these wastes, and EPA requests comments onthe current use of recovery of acids. By definition, wastes in these subcategoriesare liquids; therefore, based on the minimum technology requirements forsurface impoundments and the ban on liquids in landfills, EPA believesthat few, if any, of these wastes are surface-disposed. EPA believes sufficientneutralization capacity does exist for acid and alkaline D002 wastes thatare surface-disposed; therefore, EPA is not proposing a national capacityvariance for them. For the D002 other corrosives category, EPA is proposing deactivation asa method of treatment. These wastes can be deactivated using chemical reagents.In addition, EPA believes that these wastes are generated sporadicallyand in low volumes. Therefore, it is not proposing to grant a nationalcapacity variance for them. (c) <T3>Reactive Characteristic Wastes (D003). </T3>For D003 wastes, EPA hasidentified five treatability groups: reactive cyanides, explosives, waterreactives, reactive sulfides, and other reactives. For D003 reactive cyanides,EPA is considering the transfer of numerical standards from cyanide wastesfrom electroplating, heat treating, or acrylonitrile production. Althoughreactive cyanides account for the majority of the quantity of D003 generated,EPA believes that most are already being treated by alkaline chlorination,wet-air oxidation, or electro-oxidation. Furthermore, these wastes arealready restricted from landfills by existing regulations (40 CFR part264.312, 265.312). EPA believes that sufficient capacity does exist forthe volume of surface-disposed D003 cyanide reactive wastes and is notproposing a national capacity variance for them. For D003 reactive sulfides, the Agency is proposing to require chemicaloxidation and chemical precipitation, alkaline chlorination and chemicalprecipitation, or incineration and chemical precipitation to insolublesulfates rather than proposing numerical standards. EPA believes sufficientcapacity does exist for the volume of surface-disposed D003 sulfide wastesand is not proposing a national capacity variance for them. For D003 explosive wastes, the Agency is proposing deactivation as a methodof treatment. Because these wastes are already restricted from land disposalby existing regulations and are commonly burned and/or detonated openly,EPA is not proposing to grant a national capacity variance for their surfacedisposal. The proposed method of treatment for D003 water-reactive wastes is alsodeactivation. EPA believes that these wastes are generated sporadicallyand in low volumes and are not typically land-disposed. Therefore, EPAis not proposing to grant a national capacity variance for their surfacedisposal. For other reactive D003 wastes, EPA is proposing deactivation as a methodof treatment. EPA believes these wastes could be incinerated or open detonated.EPA believes that there is adequate capacity for the treatment of smallvolumes of these wastes that are surface-disposed. Therefore, EPA is notproposing to grant a national capacity variance to surface disposal. (d) <T3>Potentially Reactive P and U Wastes. </T3>This subgroup includes thefollowing waste codes: <ITAG tagnum="16">P006_Aluminum phosphide (R,T) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P009_Ammonium picrate (R) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P015_Beryllium dust </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P056_Fluorine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P068_Methyl hydrazine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P073_Nickel carbonyl </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P081_Nitroglycerin (R) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P087_Osmium tetroxide </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P096_Phosphine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P105_Sodium azide </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P112_Tetranitromethane (R) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P122_Zinc phosphide (andgreater;10%) (R,T) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U023_Benzotrichloride (C,R,T) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U086_N,N-Diethylhydrazine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U096_a,a-Dimethyl benzyl hydroperoxide (R) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U098_1,1-Dimethylhydrazine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U099_1,2-Dimethylhydrazine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U103_Dimethyl sulfate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U109_1,2-Diphenylhydrazine </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U133_Hydrazine (R,T) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U134_Hydrofluoric acid (C,T) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U135_Hydrogen sulfide </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U160_Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (R,T) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U189_Phosphorus sulfide (R) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U249_Zinc phosphide (andless;10%) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These wastes are either highly reactive or explosive or are polymersthat also tend to be highly reactive. For the purpose of BDAT determinations, EPA has identified four subgroups:incinerable reactive organics and hydrazine derivatives (P009, P068, P081,P112, U023, U086, U096, U098, U099, U103, U109, U133, and U160); incinerableinorganics (P006, P096, P105, P122, U135, U189, and U249); fluorine compounds(P056 and U134); and recoverable metallic compounds (P015, P073, and P087).For incinerable organics, EPA is proposing to require the use of thermaldestruction (i.e., incineration) as a method of treatment for nonwastewatersand carbon adsorption or incineration as methods of treatment for wastewaters,rather than establishing numerical standards. Because EPA believes sufficienttreatment capacity exists for the small volume of surface-disposed incinerableorganic wastes (P009, P068, P081, P112, U023, U086, U096, U098, U099, U103,U109, U133. U160, and U186), EPA is not proposing to grant a national capacityvariance for them. For incinerable inorganic wastes, EPA is proposing a standard based onthermal destruction (i.e., incineration) for nonwastewaters and chemicaloxidation followed by precipitation to insoluble salts (rather than numericalstandards) for wastewaters. EPA believes sufficient treatment capacitydoes exist for the small volume of surface-disposed incinerable metallicwastes (P006, P096, P105, P122, U135, U189, and U249) and is not proposinga national capacity variance for them. For fluorine compounds, P056 and U134 nonwastewaters, EPA is proposingto require chemical precipitation as a method of treatment. For P056 andU134 wastewaters, EPA is proposing concentration standards based on chemicalprecipitation. EPA believes that adequate treatment capacity exists forthese wastes and is therefore not proposing to grant a capacity variancefor their surface disposal. For recoverable metallic compounds (P015, P073, and P087), EPA is proposingrecovery as a method, rather than numerical standards. EPA has determinedthat there is not enough capacity available for the volumes of these wastes.Therefore, EPA is proposing to grant a capacity variance for them. (4) Metal Wastes. This group includes arsenic, selenium, barium, cadmium,chromium, lead, mercury, silver, thallium, and vanadium wastes. (a) <T3>Arsenic and Selenium Wastes.</T3><ITAG tagnum="16"> D004_EP Toxic for arsenic</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> D010_EP Toxic for selenium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> K031_By-product salts generated in the production of MSMA and cacodylicacid</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> K084_Wastewater treatment sludges generated during the productionof veterinary pharmaceuticals from arsenic or organo-arsenic compounds</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> K101_Distillation tar residues from the distillation of aniline-basedcompounds in the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals from arsenicor organo-arsenic compounds</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> K102_Residues from the use of activated carbon for decolorizationin the production of veterinary pharmaceuticals from arsenic or organo-arseniccompounds</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> P010_Arsenic acid</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> P011_Arsenic (V) oxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> P012_Arsenic (III) oxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> P036_Dichlorophenylarsine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> P038_Diethylarsine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> P103_Selenourea</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> P114_Thallium selenite</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> U136_Cacodylic acid</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> U204_Selenious acid</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> U205_Selenium disulfide</ITAG> For arsenic and selenium nonwastewaters, EPA is proposing concentrationstandards based on vitrification. The TSDR Survey indicates that no commercialvitrification capacity exists. Therefore, EPA is proposing to grant a two-yearcapacity variance to all of the surface-disposed arsenic and selenium nonwastewaterslisted above. However, the Agency is requesting information on commercialvitrification capacity. For arsenic and selenium wastewaters, EPA is proposing treatment standardsfor which chemical precipitation may be used as an alternative treatment.The TSDR survey indicates that adequate chemical precipitation capacityexists; therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant arsenic and selenium wastewatersa capacity variance. (b) <T3>Barium Wastes. </T3>For D005 and P013 barium wastes, EPA is proposingacid or water leaching followed by chemical precipitation as sulfate orcarbonate or stabilization as methods of treatment for nonwastewaters,and a concentration standard based on chemical precipitation for wastewaters.EPA is not reopening promulgated treatment standards for cyanides in P013for comment. Sufficient capacity exists to treat surface-disposed D005and P013 wastes. Therefore EPA is not proposing to grant a national capacityvariance for these wastes. (c) <T3>Cadmium Wastes. </T3>For D006 wastes, EPA is proposing treatment standardsfor three categories: cadmium batteries, wastewaters, and nonwastewaters.For D006 cadmium batteries, EPA is proposing thermal recovery as a methodof treatment. For D006 wastewaters, EPA is proposing concentration standardsbased on chemical precipitation. For D006 nonwastewaters, EPA is proposingtwo options: (1) Concentration standards based on stabilization, and (2)stabilization or recovery as a method of treatment. EPA believes that sufficientcapacity exists to treat surface-disposed cadmium nonwastewaters and wastewaters.Therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant a national capacity variance forthem. Because cadmium batteries are land-disposed but there is no capacityfor thermal recovery, EPA is proposing to grant a national capacity variancefor cadmium batteries. (d) <T3>Chromium Wastes. </T3>For D007 chromium waste and U032 (calcium chromate)wastewaters and nonwastewaters, EPA is proposing concentration treatmentstandards based on chromium reduction and lime or sulfide precipitationand sludge dewatering. EPA believes sufficient treatment capacity existsfor the volume of these wastes. Therefore, EPA is not proposing to granta national capacity variance for them. (e) <T3>Lead Wastes.</T3><ITAG tagnum="16"> D008_EP toxic for lead</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> P110_Tetraethyl lead</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> U144_Lead acetate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> U145_Lead phosphate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"> U146_Lead subacetate</ITAG> For D008 high-concentration lead wastes, EPA is proposing thermal recoveryas a method of treatment for nonwastewaters. For D008 low-concentrationlead wastes, EPA is proposing treatment standards based on stabilizationfor nonwastewaters. For D008 low-concentration nonwastewaters containingsignificant concentrations of organics, EPA is proposing that these wastesbe pretreated by incineration prior to stabilization. For all U145 andD008 wastewaters, treatment standards are proposed based on chemical precipitationwith lime or sulfide, and sludge dewatering. For D008 lead acid batteries,EPA is proposing thermal recovery as a method of treatment. EPA believessufficient capacity exists for surface-disposed D008 wastes. Therefore,EPA is not proposing to grant a national capacity variance for them. EPA solicits comment, however, on the need for a national capacity variancefor lead-bearing wastes that are stored in land disposal units such aspiles <T3>before </T3>being resmelted. EPA has limited information suggestingthat secondary lead smelters may use storage piles for lead-bearing wastesprior to smelting. This storage is a form of land disposal under section3004(k). (As noted earlier, however, batteries themselves are containersand so placement of a battery in a storage pile is not land disposal undersection 3004(k), any more than placement of a 55-gallon drum. The storagestandards for containers still apply to battery storage areas, however.See 40 CFR part 266 subpart G.) Consequently, there must be alternativestorage (i.e., tanks or no-migration piles) for these materials. EPA thereforesolicits comment on the volumes of lead-bearing wastes that are storedin land disposal units prior to treatment by metal recovery facilities,and the need for a national capacity variance for such materials. For P110, U144, U145, and U146, EPA is proposing treatment standards basedon chemical reduction and precipitation with lime or sulfide and sludgedewatering for wastewaters, and stabilization for nonwastewaters. For P110,U144, U145, and U146 nonwastewaters containing significant concentrationsof organics, EPA is proposing pretreatment by incineration prior to stabilization.EPA believes sufficient capacity exists for the small volume of these wastesthat are surface-disposed; therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant a nationalcapacity variance for them.(f) <T3>Mercury Wastes.</T3><ITAG tagnum="16">D009_EP toxic for mercury</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">K071_Chlorine production wastes</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">K106_Wastewater treatment sludges from the mercury cell process inchlorine production</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P065_Mercury fulminate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P092_Phenylmercuric acetate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">U151_Mercury</ITAG>For D009, K071, K106, P065, P092 and U151 wastewaters, EPA is proposingconcentration standards based on chemical precipitation. Mercury-bearingwastewaters containing hexavalent chromium may require chromium reductionprior to treatment of the mercury. Likewise, wastewaters containing organicsmay require chemical oxidation prior to treatment of the mercury.For K106 and U151, EPA is proposing to establish a low mercury subcategoryand high mercury subcategory for nonwastewaters. For the high mercury subcategory,EPA is proposing roasting or retorting as a method of treatment. For thelow mercury subcategory, EPA is proposing concentration standards basedon acid leaching. Residues from the acid  leaching of the low mercury subcategorymay require thermal recovery of mercury. Treatment standards for K071 nonwastewaters were originally promulgatedin the First Third rule. EPA is proposing to revise the standards for thehigh mercury concentration subcategory. For these high mercury nonwastewaters,EPA is now proposing roasting or retorting as a method. For the low mercurysubcategory, promulgated standards are unchanged. For D009, P065, and P092 nonwastewaters, EPA is proposing roasting orretorting as a method for high mercury concentrations. If the organic contentis too high for the roasting or retorting, incineration would be requiredas a pretreatment step for these nonwastewaters. EPA believes sufficient capacity exists to treat the volume of all surface-disposedmercury wastewaters. Thus, EPA is not proposing to grant a variance forthem. Current data do not provide sufficient information on the volumeof mercury wastes that contain high and low concentrations of mercury.Although EPA does not have any data on these mercury waste volumes, thereis no commercial acid leaching capacity and there is insufficient mercuryretorting capacity for D009, K071, K106, P065, P092, and U151 nonwastewaters.Thus, EPA is proposing to grant a two-year national variance for mercurynonwastewaters. (g) <T3>Silver Wastes. </T3>Treatment standards for P099 and P104 nonwastewaterswere promulgated in the Second Third final rule. For D011, P099, and P104wastewaters, EPA is proposing concentration standards based on chemicalprecipitation. For D011 nonwastewaters, EPA is proposing two alternatives:(1) A concentration standard based on stabilization; or (2) recovery orstabilization as a method of treatment. EPA believes adequate capacityexists to treat surface-disposed D011, P099, and P104 wastes. Therefore,EPA is not proposing a capacity variance for them.

For P114, EPA is proposing stabilizationor vitrification for nonwastewaters, and concentration standards basedon chemical oxidation followed by chemical precipitation and filtrationfor wastewaters. Based on the TSDR Survey, adequate capacity exists forsurface-disposed thallium wastewaters. Therefore, EPA is not proposingto grant a national capacity variance for thallium wastewaters. No commercialcapacity exists for vitrification; therefore, EPA is proposing to grantP114 nonwastewaters a national capacity variance. Capacity is availableto treat other thallium nonwastewaters; therefore, EPA is not proposingto grant other thallium nonwastewaters a national capacity variance. <T3>(i) Vanadium Wastes.</T3><ITAG tagnum="16">P119_Ammonium vanadate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P120_Vanadium pentoxide</ITAG>For treating these wastes, EPA is proposing thermal recovery or stabilizationas a method of treatment for nonwastewaters, and concentration standardsbased on chemical precipitation for wastewaters. Although no commercialvanadium recovery capacity has been identified, adequate stabilizationcapacity exists for treating P119 and P120 nonwastewaters. Therefore, EPAis not proposing to grant a two-year national capacity variance for P119and P120 nonwastewaters. Adequate capacity exists for chemical precipitation,and therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant P119 and P120 wastewatersa national capacity variance. (5) Specific Treatability Groups. These groups include wastes from pigmentproduction (K002 through K008); cyanide wastes (F006, F019, K011, K013,K014, P031, P033, U246); K015; gases (P076, P078, U115); K086; F002 andF005; K022, K025, K026, K035, and K083; K036 and K037; F024 and F025; K044,K045, K046, K047; K060; K061; K069; K100 wastes; and K048 through K052.(a) <T3>Cyanide Wastes. </T3>For F006 wastewaters, EPA is proposing BDAT treatmentstandards based on alkaline chlorination for cyanides and chemical reductionand precipitation with lime and sulfide and sludge dewatering for metals.EPA believes that adequate capacity exists for the volume of surface-disposedF006 wastewaters. Therefore, EPA is not proposing a variance for them.Treatment standards for F019 wastewaters are based on the performance ofwet-air oxidation for cyanides. Treatment standard for metals in wastewatersare based on chromium reduction, chemical precipitation with lime and sulfide,and sludge dewatering. Treatment standards for the nonwastewaters are basedon the performance of wet-air oxidation for cyanides and stabilizationfor metals. EPA believes that inadequate capacity exists for wet-air oxidation;therefore, EPA is proposing to grant a two-year variance to F019 nonwastewaters.Because sufficient wet-air oxidation capacity exists to treat the F019wastewaters, EPA is not proposing to grant a national capacity variancefor F019 wastewaters. Treatment standards for the surface disposal of nonwastewater forms ofK011, K013, and K014 were promulgated in the Second Third rule. For K011,K013, and K014 wastewaters, EPA is proposing BDAT treatment standards basedon wet-air oxidation. The TSDR Survey shows that sufficient capacity existsfor the volume of surface-disposed K011, K013, and K014 wastewaters. Therefore,EPA is not proposing to grant a capacity variance for them.For the P and U wastes containing cyanide, P031 (Cyanogen), P033 (Cyanogenchloride), and U246 (Cyanogen bromide), EPA is proposing incineration oralkaline chlorination as methods for both wastewaters and nonwastewaters.EPA has determined that sufficient capacity exists to treat these wastes;therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant a national capacity variance forthese wastes.(b) <T3>F024 and F025 Wastes. </T3>EPA promulgated standards for F024 wastewatersand nonwastewaters in the Second Third rule based on rotary kiln incinerationfor organic constituents and chemical precipitation and vacuum filtrationfor metal constituents in wastewaters. Today, EPA is proposing stabilizationas the BDAT for treatment of metal constituents in F024 nonwastewaters.The TSDR Survey indicates that adequate treatment capacity exists for thevolume of surface-disposed F024 nonwastewaters requiring treatment. Therefore,EPA is not proposing to grant a capacity variance for them. However, thestandard for F024 includes a standard for dioxins. There is concern thatthere may not be adequate capacity for these wastes, because facilitiesmay not be accepting wastes that must meet a dioxin standard. EPA is solicitingcomments on the need for and the availability of capacity for F024, includinginformation on capacity needed and available to meet dioxin standards.Although listing of F025 waste (condensed light ends, spent filters andfilter aids, and spent dissicant wastes from the production of certainchlorinated aliphatics) has not been promulgated as a RCRA hazardous waste,EPA believes that promulgation of the listing for F025 will occur priorto the promulgation of the Third Third final rule. Most generators alreadytreat F025 as if it were hazardous, and some facilities comingle F024 andF025. Today EPA is proposing concentration treatment standards for allcategories of F025 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. The BDAT for F025 wastewaterand nonwastewater light ends, spent filters, filter aids and dessicantsis incineration. EPA has determined that no alternative treatment capacityis needed for F025 wastes. Therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant thesewastes a national capacity variance.(c) <T3>Wastes from Inorganic Pigment Production. </T3>EPA is proposing torevoke the no land disposal standard previously promulgated for K004, K005,K007, and K008 nonwastewaters. EPA is proposing BDAT based on chromiumreduction and precipitation and filtration for K002, K003, K004, K005,K006, K007, and K008 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. EPA believes thatsufficient capacity exists for surface-disposed K002, K003, K004, K005,K006, K007, and K008 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. Therefore, EPA isnot proposing to grant a capacity variance for them.(d) <T3>K015 Wastes. </T3>EPA is proposing to revoke the no land disposal basedon no generation standard previously promulgated for K015 (benzyl chloridedistillation wastes) nonwastewaters because of the reported generationof ash containing this waste. Consequently, for this waste, EPA is proposingtreatment standards for five organic and two metal constituents. Treatmentstandards for the organic constituents are based on a transfer of the performancedata of incineration for similar wastes. Treatment standards for metalconstituents are based on a transfer of the performance of stabilizationof incinerator ash for similar wastes. These technologies both have availablecapacity; therefore, EPA is not proposing a variance for K015 nonwastewaters.(e) <T3>K022, K025, K026, K035, and K083 Wastes.</T3> EPA promulgated treatmentstandards for K022, K025 and K083 nonwastewaters in the First Third rule.For organics in K022 wastewaters and nonwastewaters, EPA is proposing treatmentstandards based on incineration. For metals in K022 wastewaters, EPA isproposing treatment standards based on chemical precipitation. Alternatively,EPA is proposing K022 treatment standards expressed as methods of treatment.For K025 nonwastewaters, EPA is revising the treatment standard of no landdisposal based on no generation. For K025 wastewaters, EPA is proposingconcentration treatment standards for organics based on liquid-liquid extractionand steam stripping and carbon adsorption. The proposed treatment standardsfor K025 nonwastewaters are based on incineration. Alternatively, EPA isproposing to require these methods of treatment as a prerequisite for landdisposal of K025 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. Incineration of K025 wastewatersis also proposed as an equivalent method of treatment for K025 wastewaters.For K026 and K035, the treatment standards for wastewaters and nonwastewatersare based on incineration. Alternatively, EPA is proposing to require incinerationas a prerequisite for land disposal of K026 wastewaters and nonwastewaters.EPA is revising the standard of no land disposal for K083 nonwastewaters.For organics identified in K083 wastewaters and nonwastewaters, EPA isproposing treatment standards based on incineration. For metals in K083wastewaters, EPA is proposing treatment standards based on chemical precipitation.For metals in K083 nonwastewaters, EPA is proposing treatment standardsbased on stabilization. Alternatively, EPA is proposing K083 treatmentstandards expressed as methods of treatment.EPA believes that adequate capacity exists for K022 wastewaters, K025 wastewatersand nonwastewaters, K026 wastewaters and nonwastewaters, K035 wastewatersand nonwastewaters, and K083 wastewaters and nonwastewaters, and therefore,EPA is not proposing to grant these wastes a capacity variance.(f) <T3>K036 and K037 Wastes. </T3>EPA promulgated a treatment standard ofno land disposal based on no generation for K036 nonwastewaters in theFirst Third rule. EPA also promulgated treatment standards based on incinerationfor K037 wastewaters and nonwastewaters in the First Third rule. Today,EPA is proposing revised treatment standards for the nonwastewater formof K036 (still bottoms from toluene reclamation distillation in the productionof disulfoton) and the wastewater form of K037 (wastewater treatment sludgesfrom the production of disulfoton). EPA is proposing to transfer the concentrationstandards from K037 nonwastewaters based on incineration to other formsof K036 nonwastewaters (e.g., K036 spill residues). EPA believes that adequatecapacity exists for these surface-disposed K036 nonwastewaters. Therefore,EPA is not proposing to grant a national capacity variance for them. For K037 wastewaters, EPA is proposing a revised concentration standardfrom one based on rotary kiln incineration to one based on biological treatment.EPA believes that adequate capacity exists for surface-disposed K037 wastewaters;therefore, EPA is not proposing a capacity variance for them.(g) <T3>K044, K045, K046, K047 wastes. </T3>For K044, K045, and K047, EPA isproposing to revoke the no land disposal based on reactivity standard promulgatedin the First Third rule. EPA is proposing deactivation as a method of treatmentfor wastewaters and nonwastewaters. EPA believes adequate capacity existsto treat these wastes; therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant them anational capacity variance.In the First Third rule, EPA promulgated treatment standards based on stabilizationfor K046 nonreactive nonwastewaters. Today EPA is proposing standards forK046 reactive nonwastewaters based on stabilization. For K046 reactivewastewaters, EPA is proposing the use of deactivation and chemical precipitation,settling, and filtration as a BDAT. For K046 non-reactives wastewaters,EPA is proposing chemical precipitation, settling and filtration for wastewatersas a BDAT. EPA believes that adequate capacity exists for these wastesand, therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant them a national capacityvariance.(h) <T3>K060 Wastes. </T3>Today EPA is proposing to revoke the no land disposalbased on no generation standards promulgated for K060 nonwastewaters inthe First Third rule. For K060 nonwastewaters, EPA is proposing incinerationas the BDAT. EPA is proposing BDAT standards for K060 wastewaters basedon biological treatment. For K060 arsenic nonwastewaters, EPA is proposingBDAT standards based on vitrification. EPA believes that adequate capacityexists for the volume of surface-disposed  K060 wastewaters and nonwastewatersrequiring treatment. Therefore, it is not proposing to grant a capacityvariance for them.(i) <T3>K061 Wastes. </T3>In the First Third final rule, EPA promulgated treatmentstandards for K061 nonwastewaters. In this rule, two subcategories fornonwastewater forms of K061 were defined. The low zinc subcategory (lessthan 15 percent) and the high zinc category (greater than 15 percent) weredefined as separate treatability groups. BDAT for the low zinc subcategorywas based on the performance of stabilization. For the high zinc subcategory,the final standard was ``No Land Disposal Based on High Temperature MetalsRecovery as a Method of Treatment'' technology. Today, EPA is proposingto revise the promulgated treatment standard for the high zinc subcategoryto be resmelting in a high temperature zinc metal recovery furnace. Forthe First Third final rule, K061 nonwastewaters were granted a nationalcapacity variance. Today's proposed refinement in the treatment standarddoes not change the schedule for the capacity variance for K061 nonwastewaters.Today, EPA is proposing the BDAT standard based on chromium reduction andchemical precipitation with lime and sulfide and sludge dewatering forwastewaters. EPA believes adequate capacity exists for the volume of surface-disposedK061 wastewaters. Therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant a variance forthem.(j) <T3>K069 Wastes. </T3>Today, EPA is proposing to revoke the no land disposalbased on recycling standard promulgated in the First Third rule for thenon-calcium sulfate subcategory for K069 nonwastewaters. For calcium sulfatenonwastewaters, EPA is proposing a standard based on the performance ofstabilization. For non-calcium sulfate nonwastewaters, EPA is proposingrecycling as a method of treatment. For wastewaters, EPA is proposing aBDAT standard based on chemical precipitation. EPA believes adequate capacityexists to treat the volume of surface-disposed K069 wastewaters and nonwastewaters;therefore, EPA is not proposing a capacity variance for them.(k) <T3>Revisions to K086 Wastes. </T3>EPA promulgated treatment standardsfor K086 solvent washes in the First Third Rule based on incineration andstabilization of ash for nonwastewaters and incineration and chromium reduction,chemical precipitation and filtration for wastewaters. Today EPA is proposingto revise these standards and propose standards for the caustic sludgesand water sludges subcategories. EPA is proposing treatment standards forall K086 wastewater and nonwastewater wastes based on incineration fororganics and chromium reduction, followed by excess lime precipitation,and filtration for metals. As a ``worst-case'' analysis, EPA included inthe capacity analysis conducted for First Third wastes all of the K086wastes identified in the TSDR Survey. Consequently, no additional capacitywill be required by today's proposal, and no capacity variance is beingproposed for K086 wastes.(l) <T3>K100 Wastes. </T3>For K100 nonwastewaters, EPA is proposing to revokethe no land disposal based on no generation standards promulgated in theFirst Third rule. Today, EPA is proposing treatment standards based onstabilization for nonwastewaters and chemical precipitation for wastewaters.EPA believes adequate capacity exists to treat the volume of surface-disposedK100 wastes. Therefore, EPA is not proposing a capacity variance for them.(m) <T3>Gases. </T3>This treatability group includes the following groups:P076 (Nitric oxide), P078 (Nitrogen dioxide), and Ul15 (Ethylene oxide).For P076, P078, and U115 wastewaters and nonwastewaters, EPA is proposingrecovery as a method of treatment. EPA believes that these wastes are generatedas gases and industry typically reuses or recovers compressed gases directly.EPA also believes that these gases are not land disposed. Although no commercialcapacity exists for recovery of these gases, EPA is not proposing to granta national capacity variance for these wastes, because the Agency believesthese wastes will not require commercial alternative treatment.(n) <T3>Revisions to Petroleum Refining Wastes (K048-K052).</T3> For the FirstThird rule, EPA promulgated treatment standards for K048 through K052 basedon data from incineration, solvent extraction, and treatment of the metalsin wastewater and nonwastewater residuals. Today, EPA is proposing additionaltreatment standards based on a reevaluation of the data and is proposingthat these revised standards, with five exceptions, take effect exactlyone year following the Third Third rulemaking promulgation date. The fiveexceptions, whose standards have been increased based on the revised dataare: benzo (a) pyrene, ortho and para cresols, di-n-butyl phthalate, andphenol. For these exceptions, EPA is proposing that the new standards becomeeffective on August 8, 1990, when the capacity variance issued on K048through K052 wastes expires. EPA is proposing treatment standards for cyanide K048 through K052 wastewatersbased on incineration. EPA is also proposing BDAT concentration standardsfor organics in K048 through K052 nonwastewaters based on solvent extraction.The Agency is not proposing revisions to promulgated BDAT treatment standardsfor wastewater constituents in K048 through K052 wastewaters, other thancyanide, nor for any metal constituents in the K048 through K052 wastewatersor nonwastewaters. The Agency has only revised the concentration-basedtreatment standards for K048 through K052 nonwastewaters; EPA has not reevaluatedthe selection of solvent extraction and incineration as BDAT for organicsin nonwastewaters. Because the capacity analysis was conducted for thesewastes in the First Third rule and the technologies needed to achieve BDATtreatment standards are not being revised, EPA did not reevaluate the alternativecapacity requirements for K048 through K052 wastes.(o) <T3>Additional Treatment Standards for F002 and F005 Wastes.</T3> Treatmentstandards for F002 and F005 were promulgated in the Solvents and Dioxinsrule. Today EPA is proposing revisions to the treatment standards for F002and F005 to account for four newly listed F002 and F005 constituents. TheBDAT for wastewaters is based on biological treatment, and liquid-liquidextraction and steam stripping and carbon adsorption. The BDAT for nonwastewatersis based on incineration. The Agency believes that adequate treatment capacityexists for these wastes and therefore, EPA is not proposing a nationalcapacity variance for these wastes.(p) <T3>Capacity Determination for Multi-Source Leachate_</T3>(1) <T3>Definition and Applicability. </T3>EPA defines multi-source leachateas leachate that is derived from the treatment, storage, disposal, or recyclingof more than one listed hazardous waste. Under today's proposed rule, suchleachate will be restricted from land disposal. Residues from treatingsuch leachate, as well as residues such as soil and ground water that arecontaminated by such leachate, are also restricted from land disposal underthis rule. Leachate deriving from a single source must meet the standarddeveloped for the waste code from which it is derived; therefore, suchleachate is not subject to the standards developed for multi-source leachate.(EPA is also soliciting comment on modifying the definition of multi-sourceleachate.) (2) <T3>Previous Treatment Standards. </T3>EPA originally imposed a land disposalrestriction on multi-source leachate under the First Third of the landdisposal restrictions (LDRs). Under the LDRs, multi-source leachate wouldhave to be treated to satisfy all the standards applicable to the originalwastes from which the leachate is derived (see 53 FR 31146-150 (August17, 1988)). EPA revisited the issue of treatability of multi-source leachateto address concerns raised by the hazardous waste management industry,and rescheduled promulgation of a land disposal restriction for multi-sourceleachate to the Third Third of the LDRs in order to fully study the mostappropriate section 3004(m) treatment standards for multi-source leachate(see 54 FR 8264 (January 27, 1989)). Leachate derived from disposal ofthe listed dioxin-containing hazardous wastes and California list wasteswere not rescheduled.(3) <T3>Proposed Treatment Standards. </T3>In section 7.b of this preamble,EPA is proposing two options for the development of treatment standardsfor multi-source leachate. Under the first option, EPA would continue theapplication of the carry-through principle under which multi-source leachatemust meet the standards established for all the waste codes from whichit is derived. Under the second option, EPA would establish one set ofwastewater standards and one set of nonwastewater standards for multi-sourceleachate; these standards would also apply to residuals derived from thestorage, treatment, or disposal of multi-source leachate. For treatingmulti-source leachate in the form of wastewater, EPA is considering recommendingthe treatment of wastewaters by wet-air oxidation or biological treatment,followed by carbon adsorption, or incineration. For nonwastewaters derivedfrom treating multi-source leachate, EPA is considering a treatment standardbased on incineration for organic constituents and on stabilization formetals. (4) <T3>Determination of Volumes Requiring Alternative Treatment or RecoveryCapacity. </T3>EPA relied primarily on data from the TSDR Survey and fromthe Generator Survey to determine whether sufficient alternative treatmentor recovery capacity is available for multi-source leachate. Multi-sourceleachate is primarily generated in landfills. All the active regulatedfacilities generating and managing leachate are accounted for in the TSDRand Generator Surveys because (1) the TSDR Survey is a census of all thehazardous waste treatment, storage, disposal, and recycling facilitiesin the country; and (2) the Generator Survey, while it is a sample of hazardouswaste generators, includes every facility that responded to the TSDR Survey.EPA recognizes that multi-source leachate can also be generated at closedfacilities. However, only sparse data characterizing leachate currentlyexist for those facilities and how much is presently land-disposed in surfacedisposal units. The Agency requests comments on the characterization ofmulti-source leachate at closed facilities and how much is presently land-disposedin surface disposal units. EPA also welcomes the submission of current data from interested partieson the volumes of multi-source leachate generated, the current managementof such leachate, the amount of residuals generated, and the waste constituentcomposition of multi-source leachate.In addition to data from the TSDR and Generator Surveys, EPA examined datasubmitted as part of a leachate study plan by four major companies managinghazardous wastes at 17 facilities. These companies included Chemical WasteManagement (CWM)/Waste Management of North America (WMNA), Browning FerrisIndustries (BFI)/CECOS, DuPont, and Dow Chemical.Based on evaluation of this information, EPA estimated volume of multi-sourceleachate requiring alternative treatment or recovery. EPA recognizes thatthe actual total quantity of multi-source leachate generated, managed,and land-disposed may be much larger than the volumes reported in the surveysupon which this analysis is based. Consequently, EPA welcomes commentsby interested parties on the current generation, management, and land disposalof multi-source leachate.(5) <T3>Determination of National Variances for Multi-Source Leachate. </T3>EPAanalyzed the alternative treatment or recovery capacity for two categoriesof multi-source leachate: wastewaters and nonwastewaters.Treatment standards for wastewaters are based on wet-air oxidation andcarbon adsorption, biodegradation and carbon adsorption, and incinerationfor organic constituents; for inorganic constituents, treatment standardsare based on chemical precipitation. Given the very low volumes of surface-disposedmulti-source leachate wastewaters and the adequate capacity to treat thesewastes using the above treatment technologies, EPA is not proposing togrant a variance for surface-disposed multi-source leachate wastewaters.Treatment standards for nonwastewaters are based on incineration as a methodfor wastes containing organic constituents, and on stabilization for wastescontaining inorganic constituents. EPA is proposing to grant a two-yearvariance for surface-disposed multi-source leachate nonwastewaters in theform of non-atomizable sludges and solids, because there is insufficientincineration capacity for these wastes. However, EPA is not proposing togrant a national capacity variance to nonwastewater multi-source leachatein the form of atomizable organic liquids because there are very low volumesof such wastes and there is sufficient capacity for them. (q) <T3>Capacity Determination for Mixed Radioactive Wastes</T3>_(1) <T3>Background.</T3> EPA has defined a mixed RCRA/radioactive waste asany matrix containing a RCRA hazardous waste and a radioactive waste subjectto the Atomic Energy Act (53 FR 37045, 37046, September 23, 1988). Regardlessof the type of radioactive constituents that these wastes contain (e.g.,high-level, low-level, or transuranic), they are subject to RCRA hazardouswaste regulations, including the land disposal restrictions.Radioactive wastes that are mixed with spent solvents, dioxins, or Californialist wastes are subject to the land disposal restrictions already promulgatedfor those hazardous wastes. EPA has determined, however, that radioactivewastes that are mixed with First Third and Second Third wastes will beincluded in the Third Third rulemaking (40 CFR 268.12(c)). Thus, today'sproposal addresses radioactive wastes that contain First Third, SecondThird, and Third Third wastes.(2) <T3>Data Sources. </T3>The Department of Energy (DOE) is a major generatorof mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes. For data on DOE wastes, EPA used a dataset submitted by DOE. The data set, which is based on a recent DOE survey,contains information on mixed RCRA/radioactive waste inventories, generationrates, and existing and planned treatment capacity at 21 DOE facilities.A variety of non-DOE facilities also generate mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes,including nuclear power plants, academic and medical institutions, andindustrial facilities. A variety of information sources were used to identifythe non-DOE generators, estimate the quantities and types of mixed RCRA/radioactivewastes that they generate, and determine current management practices andtreatment capacity. These sources included the TSDR Survey, the GeneratorSurvey, and other studies. EPA believes that these sources provide the best available informationon non-DOE mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes. However, EPA is interested inobtaining additional information on their generation, characterization,and management. (3) <T3>Determinations of National Variances for Mixed RCRA/Radioactive Wastes.</T3>After investigating the data sources noted above, EPA estimated thatapproximately 363 million gallons of radioactive waste mixed with First,Second, and Third Third wastes will require treatment. This volume includeswastes generated annually as well as untreated wastes in storage and contaminatedsoil and debris. EPA has also determined that alternative treatment capacityis not available for mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes. Consequently, EPA proposesto grant a national variance for mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes. AlthoughDOE has plans to increase its capacity to treat mixed RCRA/ radioactivewastes, data supplied by DOE indicate that DOE currently lacks adequatecapacity to treat its mixed RCRA/ radioactive wastes. In addition, adequatecommercial treatment capacity is not available. Thus, EPA has determinedthat sufficient alternative treatment capacity is not available and isproposing a two-year national capacity variance for mixed RCRA/radioactivewastes.EPA recognizes that its information on mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes generatedand managed by non-DOE facilities may be incomplete. Consequently, theAgency requests comments by interested parties on the current generationof mixed RCRA/radioactive wastes. Of particular interest to EPA is informationon mixtures of radioactive wastes and First, Second, or Third Third wastestreams. <T3>2. Determination of Alternative Capacity and Effective Dates for UndergroundInjected Waste.</T3> The Agency is today proposing effective dates forthe restrictions against the underground injection of virtually all remainingRCRA section 3004(g) wastes, including characteristic wastes, for whichno effective dates have been set. EPA is not acting on certain newly listedor newly identified wastes. EPA solicits comment on the volumes and characteristicsof the wastes represented in this section, as well as any information onthe characteristics and volumes of any multi-source leachate that is currentlybeing injected.<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Proposed Effective Date Determinations for Wastes With TreatmentStandards Proposed in Today's Rule</ITAG>Consistent with the policy established in previous land disposal restrictions,the Agency is proposing to restrict on May 8, 1990, the underground injectionof all wastes, with treatment standards proposed in today's rule, thatare not currently being deepwell-injected. This decision is consistentwith the intent of RCRA in moving hazardous wastes away from disposal andtoward treatment. Wastes that are not currently being deepwell-injectedare listed in Table III.B.2.(a). The volumes of deepwell-injected wastes that require alternative commercialtreatment and/or recycling capacity are presented in Table III.B.2.(b).This table does not include wastes that are currently being deepwell-injected,and the facility has an appropriate on-site alternative treatment technologyfor treating the waste. The Agency is proposing effective date determinations for all undergroundinjected wastes in treatability groups. If there is adequate availablealternative treatment capacity for all the injected volume in a singletreatability group, then every waste in that group will be restricted fromunderground injection on May 8, 1990. If there is inadequate availablealternative treatment capacity for the injected volume in a single treatabilitygroup, then the Agency is proposing to allocate as much of the availablecapacity to the wastes requiring treatment. All remaining wastes in thetreatability group, for which no capacity exists, will receive a two-yearnational capacity variance. EPA believes this is most consistent with Congressionalintent, which both favors treatment over disposal, and minimal use of capacityvariances. EPA specifically solicits comment on this approach. Table III.B.2.(c)indicates the amount of capacity available for treating underground injectedwastes, the demand from these injected wastes on each treatability group,and which treatability groups require capacity variances. More informationon the Agency's procedure for apportioning treatment capacity in thesetreatability groups can be found in the Third Thirds Background Documentfor the treatability groups.<ITAG

than 100,000 gallons/year) amounts of underground injected wastes.The Agency believes that these small streams place little demand on nationwidetreatment capacity.Presented below are the BDATs for treating deepwell-injected wastes. (1) <T3>Alkaline Chlorination. </T3>Treatment standards based on alkaline chlorinationare today being proposed for D003a (cyanide) and P056 wastes. As shownin Table III.B.2.(c), the 1.9 million gallons per year of available capacityare inadequate to address the quantity of hazardous waste annually deepwell-injectedrequiring this type of treatment. Excluding D003a (cyanide), however, adequatecapacity exists for the remaining waste. The Agency is proposing to granta two-year capacity variance to D003a (cyanide) wastewaters. This wastewill be restricted from injection on May 8, 1992.(2) <T3>Alkaline Chlorination and Chemical Precipitation.</T3>Treatment standardsbased on alkaline chlorination and chemical precipitation are today beingproposed for F006 cyanide wastewaters. As shown in Table III.B.2.(c), the6.4 million gallons of available capacity is adequate to treat the quantityof hazardous waste annually deepwell-injected requiring this type of treatment.(3) <T3>Carbon Adsorption and Chemical Precipitation. </T3>Treatment standardsbased on carbon adsorption (or wet air oxidation) and chemical precipitationare today being proposed for metals in K022 and K083 wastewaters. As shownin Table III.B.2.(c), the 41 million gallons of available capacity areadequate to treat the quantity of hazardous waste annually deepwell-injectedrequiring this type of treatment. (4) <T3>Chemical Oxidation and Chemical Precipitation. </T3>The treatment standardsbased on a ``treatment train'' of chemical oxidation and chemical precipitationare today being proposed for D003b (sulfides) and P122 wastes. As shownin Table III.B.2.(c), the 24 million gallons per year of available capacityare inadequate to address the quantity of hazardous wastes annually deepwell-injectedrequiring this type of treatment. Excluding D003b (sulfide), however, adequatecapacity exists to treat the remaining waste. The Agency is proposing atwo-year capacity variance to D003b (sulfide) wastewaters. This waste willbe restricted from injection on May 8, 1992. (5) <T3>Chemical Precipitation. </T3>Wastewater forms of D004, D005, D006,D008a, (lead-non-battery), D009a (inorganic mercury), D010, D011, F006,K031, P011, U134, and U151 represent those wastes best treated by chemicalprecipitation. As shown in Table III.B.2.(c), the 339 million gallons peryear of available chemical precipitation are adequate to treat the quantityof hazardous waste annually deepwell-injected requiring this type of treatment.The Agency is proposing to restrict these wastes from underground injectionon May 8, 1990. (6) <T3>Chromium Reduction and Chemical Precipitation. </T3>Treatment standardsbased on chromium reduction and chemical precipitation are today beingproposed for wastewater forms of D007, K002, K086, and U032. As shown inTable III.B.2.(c), the 48 million gallons per year of available chromiumreduction and chemical precipitation are inadequate to treat the quantityof hazardous waste annually deepwell-injected requiring this type of treatment.Excluding D007, however, adequate capacity exists to treat the remainingwastes. The Agency is proposing to grant a two-year treatment capacityvariance to D007, restricting this waste from underground injection onMay 8, 1992. (7) <T3>Combustion of Liquids. </T3>Combustion of liquids is the BDAT for D001a(ignitables), D012, D013, D014, D015, D016, D017, K032, K097, P005, P020,P048, P050, P051, P057, P059, P069, P075, P102, U001, U002, U007, U008,U009, U012, U019, U031, U034, U037, U044, U045, U055, U056, U070, U074,U080, U103, U105, U106, U112, U113, U115, U118, U122, U133, U138, U140,U147, U154, U157, U159, U160, U162, U165, U169, U170, U185, U188, U192,U194, U197, U200, U210, U211, U219, U220, U226, U227, U228, U239, and U244.Although U041, U077, U083, U084, and U213 are also underground injected,because they will be treated on-site, their quantities are not includedin required capacity for combustion of liquids. As shown in Table III.B.2.(c),the 233 million gallons per year of available capacity are adequate totreat the quantity of hazardous waste annually deepwell-injected requiringthis type of treatment. These wastes will be restricted from undergroundinjection on May 8, 1990. (8) <T3>Mercury Retorting. </T3>Treatment standards based on mercury retortingare today being proposed for nonwastewater forms of D009 wastes. As shownin Table III.B.2.(c), the less than .01 million gallons per year of availablemercury retorting capacity are inadequate to treat the quantity of thiswaste annually deepwell-injected requiring this type of treatment. TheAgency is proposing to grant a two-year treatment capacity variance tothe nonwastewater forms of D009, restricting this waste from undergroundinjection on May 8, 1992. (9) <T3>Neutralization. </T3>Neutralization is the treatment standard for D002wastes. As shown in Table III.B.2.(c), the 15 million gallons per yearof available neutralization capacity are inadequate to treat the quantityof hazardous waste annually deepwell-injected requiring this type of treatment.The Agency is proposing to grant a two-year treatment capacity varianceto the D002 wastewaters, restricting this waste from underground injectionon May 8, 1992. (10) <T3>Stabilization. </T3>For residuals containing D005, D006, D007, D008a(Lead-non-battery), D011, K002, P056, U002, U032, U055, and U188, the treatmentstandard being proposed is based on stabilization. As shown in Table III.B.2.(c),the 345 million gallons per year of available capacity are adequate totreat the quantity of hazardous waste residuals requiring this type oftreatment. These residuals will be restricted from land disposal on May8, 1990. (11) <T3>Treatment of Reactives and Chromium Reduction and Chemical Precipitation.</T3>Treatment standards based on treatment of reactives and chromium reductionand chemical precipitation are today being proposed for D003 (explosives/reactives).As shown in Table III.B.2.(c), the less than 1 million gallons per yearof available capacity are inadequate to treat the quantity of D003 (explosives/reactives)waste annually deepwell-injected requiring this type of treatment. TheAgency is proposing to grant a two-year treatment capacity variance tothis waste, restricting D003 (explosives/reactives) wastewaters from undergroundinjection on May 8, 1992.(12) <T3>Wet-Air Oxidation.</T3> K011, K013, and K014, represent all of theunderground injected hazardous wastes addressed in today's rule that arebest treated by wet-air oxidation. As shown in Table III.B.2.(c), the lessthan l million gallons of available capacity are inadequate to treat thequantity of K011 wastewaters, K013 wastewaters, and K014 wastewaters annuallydeepwell-injected requiring this type of treatment; therefore, EPA is proposingto grant a two-year treatment capacity variance to the wastewater formsof K011, K013, and K014, restricting these wastes from underground injectionon May 8, 1992. (13) <T3>Wet-Air Oxidation And Carbon Adsorption.</T3> For P058 wastewaters,treatment standards based on wet-air oxidation and carbon adsorption arebeing proposed today. As shown in Table III.B.2.(c), the less than 1 milliongallons of available capacity are adequate to treat the quantity of P058annually deepwell-injected requiring this type of treatment; therefore,EPA is not proposing to grant a national capacity variance for this waste.(14) <T3>Wet-Air Oxidation And Chemical Precipitation.</T3> Treatment Standardsbased on wet-air oxidation and chemical precipitation are today being proposedfor F019 wastewaters. As shown in Table III.B.2.(c), the less than l milliongallons of available capacity are adequate to treat the quantity of F019 wastewaters annually deepwell-injected requiring this type of treatment;therefore, the Agency is not proposing to grant a two-year treatment capacityvariance to F019 wastewaters, restricting this waste from underground injectionon May 8, 1990.Table III.B.2.(d) summarizes the wastes for which EPA isproposing to granta two-year national capacity variance for underground injected wastes.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. A Request for Data on Underground Injected K014 Nonwastewaters</ITAG>EPA addressed the underground injection of K011 and K013 nonwastewatersin the June 8, 1989, Second Third final rule. In that rule, a two-yearcapacity variance was granted due to the lack of alternative incinerationcapacity (54 FR 26642). Action of K014 nonwastewaters was deferred so thatthe Agency could evaluate information on the composition, characteristics,and volumes associated with this waste. EPA currently has no informationindicating that K014 nonwastewaters are being underground injected. TheAgency specifically solicits information on this situation. EPA is proposingto restrict the underground injection of K014 nonwastewaters on May 8,1990. EPA will take into account any data received before finalizing thisdate.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s220,r100,xs72</C><T4>Table </T4>III.B.2.(d)_<T4>Summary of Proposed Two-Year National Capacity Variance for UndergroundInjected Wastes</T4><H1>Required alternative treatment technology </H1><H1>Waste code </H1><H1>Physical form</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Alkaline Chlorination <D>D003\4\ </D><D>Wastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chemical Oxidation and Chemical Precipitation <D>D003\5\ </D><D>Wastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium Reduction and Chemical Precipitation <D>D007 </D><D>Wastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mercury Retorting <D>D009 </D><D>Nonwastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Neutralization <D>D002 </D><D>Wastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Treatment of Reactives and Chromium Reduction andamp; Chemical Precipitation<D>D003\6\ </D><D>Wastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wet-Air Oxidation <D>K011 </D><D>Wastewater.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>K013 </D><D>Wastewater.</D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>K014 </D><D>Wastewater.</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Wet-Air Oxidation and Carbon Adsorption, Biological Treatment and CarbonAdsorption, or Incineration <D>Leachate\7\ </D><D>Wastewater.</D><F>\4\ D003 (Cyanides).</F><F>\5\ D003 (Sulfides).</F><F>\6\ D003 (Explosives, Reactives).</F><F>\7\ Multi-Source Leachate.</F></ITAG></ITAG>c. <T3>Deepwell Injected Multi-Source Leachate. </T3>EPA is estimating thatmulti-source leachate containing both organic and inorganic constituentsare currently underground injected. The Agency is proposing a treatmentstandard for multi-source leachate wastewaters based on wet-air oxidationfollowed by carbon adsorption, biological treatment followed by carbonadsorption, or incineration for wastes containing organic constituents,and on chemical precipitation and filtration for wastes containing inorganicconstituents. Because there is insufficient capacity to treat wastewatersbased on these treatment technologies, EPA is proposing to grant a two-yearvariance for multi-source leachate that is underground injected.d. <T3>Mixed Radioactive Wastes. </T3>EPA requires radioactive wastes mixedwith RCRA regulated solvents and dioxins to meet LDRs and treatment standardsestablished for those solvents and dioxins when mixed with radioactivewastes. EPA currently has no information on mixed radioactive wastes thatare underground injected; therefore, EPA is not proposing to grant a nationalcapacity variance for these wastes. EPA is requesting comments on mixedradioactive wastes that are being underground injected. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Capacity Variances for Contaminated Soil and Debris </ITAG>EPA is proposing today to grant an extension of the effective date forcertain First, Second, and Third Third contaminated soil and debris forwhich the treatment standards proposed today are based on combustion, wet-airoxidation, vitrification, or mercury retorting. RCRA section 3004(h)(2)allows the Administrator to grant an extension to the effective date basedon the earliest date on which adequate alternative capacity will be available,but not to exceed two years `` * * * after the effective date of the prohibitionwhich would otherwise apply under subsection (d), (e), (f), or (g).'' ForFirst Third and Second Third wastes that have heretofore been subject tothe ``soft hammer'' provisions (see section I.B.9) but for which treatmentstandards are being promulgated today, EPA is interpreting the statutorylanguage `` * * * effective date of the prohibition that would otherwiseapply to be the date treatment standards are promulgated for these wastes(i.e., May 8, 1989), rather than the date on which the ``soft hammer''provisions took effect (i.e., August 8, 1988, and June 8, 1989, respectively).''EPA finds this the best interpretation for two reasons. Extensions of theeffective date are based on the available capacity of the BDAT for thewaste, so it is reasonable that such an extension begin on the date onwhich treatment standards based on performance of the BDAT are established.Furthermore, EPA does not intend, in effect, to penalize generators ofFirst Third and Second Third wastes by allowing less time (i.e., 28 monthsand 37 months, respectively) for the development of needed capacity, whilegenerators of Third Third wastes in the same treatability group are allowedthe maximum 48 months (assuming capacity does not become available at anearlier date). The proposed capacity extension would therefore commencefor First, Second, and Third Third wastes on May 8, 1990, and would extend(at maximum) until May 8, 1992. For the purpose of determining whether a contaminated material is subjectto this capacity extension, soil is defined as materials that are primarilygeologic in origin, such as silt, loam, or clay, and that are indigenousto the natural geological environment. In certain cases, soils will bemixed with liquids or sludges. EPA will determine on a case-by-case basiswhether all or portions of such mixtures should be considered soil (52FR 31197, November 8, 1986). Debris is defined as materials that are primarily non-geologic in origin,such as grass, trees, stumps, shrubs, and man-made materials (e.g., concrete,clothing, partially buried whole or crushed empty drums, capacitors, andother synthetic manufactured items). Debris may also include geologic materials (1) identified as not indigenousto the natural environment at or near the site, or (2) identified as indigenousrocks exceeding a 9.5mm sieve size that are greater than 10 percent byweight, or that are at a total level that, based on engineering judgment,will affect performance of available treatment technologies. In many cases,debris will be mixed with liquids or sludges. EPA will determine on a case-by-casebasis whether all or portions of such mixtures should be considered debris.Analysis of the TSDR Survey data indicated that a volume of approximately17 million gallons of soil contaminated with wastes subject to this proposalwere land-disposed in 1986. However, the Superfund remediation programhas expanded significantly since that time. Plans for remediation at Superfundsites indicate that the excavation of soil and debris requiring treatment(including incineration and subsequent land disposal) will be far greaterin 1990 than in 1986. Because of the major increase in the Superfund remediationprogram, EPA believes that capacity is not adequate for combustion of ThirdThird contaminated soil and debris. In addition, the TSDR Survey indicatesthat inadequate capacity exists for soils requiring vitrification, mercuryretorting, and wet-air oxidation. A two-year extension of the effectivedate is proposed for Third Third contaminated soil and debris for whichBDAT is combustion, vitrification, mercury retorting, or wet-air oxidation.EPA is also proposing to grant a two-year national capacity variance toall soil and debris contaminated with mixed RCRA/radioactive waste. EPAhas estimated that insufficient treatment capacity exists to handle soiland debris contaminated with mixed radioactive waste. EPA notes that if soil and debris are contaminated with Third Third prohibitedwastes whose treatment standard is based on incineration and also withother prohibited wastes whose treatment standard is based on a non-combustiontype of technology, the soil and debris would remain eligible for the nationalcapacity variance. This is because the contaminated soil and debris wouldstill have to be treated by some form of combustion technology that EPAhas evaluated as being unavailable at present. However, there is one exceptionto this principle. If the soil and debris are contaminated with a prohibitedwaste (or wastes) that is no longer eligible for a national capacity extension,such as certain types of prohibited solvent wastes, then the soil and debriswould have to be treated to meet the treatment standard for that prohibitedwaste (or wastes). Any other interpretation would result in EPA's extendingthe date of a prohibition beyond the dates established by Congress, andtherefore beyond EPA's legal authority.C. Characteristic Wastes <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General Considerations </ITAG>In today's rule, EPA is proposing treatment standards for those wasteswhich exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: ignitability,corrosivity, reactivity or EP toxicity (40 CFR 261.21-24). For the purposeof setting BDAT treatment standards, each characteristic waste is subdividedinto subcategories which correspond to waste treatability groups. For example,an ignitable characteristic waste may be subcategorized as an ignitableliquid, ignitable reactive, oxidizer or ignitable gas. EPA is developing a new toxicity characteristic, known as the toxicitycharacteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), that is scheduled for promulgationin late 1989. Upon its effective date, this revised characteristic willinclude a number of additional organic hazardous constituents, and a newextraction protocol will replace the current extraction procedure (EP).The revised toxicity characteristic will include the same 14 hazardousconstituents (six pesticides and eight toxic metals) that are now regulatedunder the existing EP toxicity characteristic. EPA is proposing that theBDAT levels for wastes that exhibit EP toxicity for these 14 hazardousconstituents remain the same when the TCLP replaces the EP toxicity characteristicsince the extent of achievable treatment should not change. The Agency received several comments in response to its solicitation inthe Second Third rulemaking regarding treatment standards for characteristicwastes. These comments addressed two general areas. First, several commentersquestioned the Agency's assertion that the hard hammer provision appliesto characteristic wastes. The Agency continues to believe that the statutorylanguage is unclear, but that the legislative history for HSWA clearlyindicates that wastes which exhibited a characteristic of hazardous wasteon November 8, 1984 are subject to the hard hammer provision. The issueis of no practical significance in any case, since EPA is promulgatingtreatment standards for all hazardous wastes that exhibited characteristicsas of the date of enactment of HSWA. Second, several commenters also questioned the use of a ``No Land Disposal''treatment standard in any of its forms for characteristic wastes. EPA isnot using this standard for characteristic wastes in the proposal. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Treatment Below Characteristic Levels </ITAG>EPA is today proposing standards for certain characteristic wastes whichrequire treatment below the characteristic level. The issues concerningthis approach are discussed below. The threshold question in establishing treatment standards for characteristicwastes that are prohibited from land disposal is whether the treatmentstandard can be established at a level that is lower than the characteristiclevel. The legal argument would be that the characteristic level itselfimposes a jurisdictional limitation on the extent of treatment becausesection 3004(m) applies only to wastes that are hazardous, and by EPA'sregulations, wastes that no longer exhibit a characteristic are not hazardouswastes. An alternative reading, however, is that once wastes become subject tosection 3004(m), they remain subject to the requirements of that sectionuntil the section 3004(m) standard is satisfied. This is in fact the mostliteral reading of section 3004(m). In the context of toxic characteristichazardous wastes, this alternative reading also supports the statutorygoals and policies of seeking to reduce the uncertainties inherent in theland disposal of hazardous waste by substituting a system whereby hazardouswastes are pretreated in such a way that minimizes threats to human healthand the environment associated with land disposal. See RCRA sections 1002(b)(7),3004 (d), (e), (f), (g), and (m). There are a number of differences between characteristic wastes and listedwastes that make it important to consider the issue of further treatmentfor characteristic wastes. First, the EP toxicity characteristic is definedby levels higher than the health-based levels that have been the basisfor delisting many hazardous wastes. The Agency has always stated thatthe EP toxicants' concentrations are levels at which a waste clearly presentsa substantial hazard, and that the lower levels also may pose a hazard(see, e.g., 45 FR 33066, May 19, 1980). Thus, in most cases, treatmentbelow the characteristic level would clearly result in further minimizationof threats to human health and the environment. Second, delisting is awaste-specific process that allows EPA to consider a number of factors,including concentrations of all Appendix VIII constituents in the waste.On the other hand, characteristic wastes are no longer hazardous when theystop exhibiting a single property or fall below a constituent concentrationlevel. Thus, only under a broad reading of section 3004(m) could EPA addresstreatment for all Appendix VIII constituents in characteristic wastes,and thus reduce the prohibited waste's toxicity and mobility in a way thatfurther minimizes the threat to human health and the environment. Thesefeatures of the characteristic waste designation compel the Agency to carefullyevaluate the reach of Agency authority under section 3004(m). EPA believes one permissible construction of the statute is that wastewhich is hazardous at the point of generation and is destined for landdisposal (i.e. a prohibited hazardous waste) remains subject to the requirementsof section 3004(m) regardless of its concentration at any subsequent time,or at least must be treated to the section 3004(m) level to avoid violationof section 3004(m). Indeed, this construction is a necessary approach tovindicate the Congressional admonition against dilution in lieu of treatment.<T3>See </T3>Section III(D) below. Once subject to section 3004(m), suchwastes must be treated by methods which substantially reduce toxicity andminimize threats to human health and the environment. Thus, EPA believes it is a permissible construction of RCRA that Congressdid not intend to curtail treatment under this standard by the definitionalprovisions relating to the term ``hazardous waste'' in 40 CFR part 261.Indeed, the authority in section 3004(m) to subject characteristic wastesto treatment methods contemplates treatment to levels below the characteristiclevel, since treatment methods_for example, combustion_often cannot beneatly curtailed at the characteristic level. EPA has also stated in othercontexts that Subtitle C regulations can continue to apply to managementof wastes that no longer exhibit a characteristic. For example, the cleanclosure standards for regulated units that hold characteristic wastes requireremoval of hazardous constituents even if the waste no longer exhibitsa characteristic. See 53 FR 8705 (March 19, 1987). Thus, the continuedregulation of such units under Subtitle C depends on the degree of environmentalhazard but not on the continued presence of ``hazardous waste''. EPA alsobelieves the recent decision in <T3>Hazardous Waste Treatment Council </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, </T3>No. 86-1657 (D.C. Cir. September15, 1989) supports the view that EPA has considerable flexibility in settingstandards under section 3004(m) and that section 3004(m) can operate independentlyof other RCRA provisions which do not have the same ultimate standard.\1\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ EPA has, thus far, set section 3004(m) performance standardsfor listed hazardous wastes based on the limits of demonstrated availabletechnology, and not on standards adopted under other statutory standardsand provisions. This approach was challenged by industry petitioners in<T3>Hazardous Waste Treatment Council </T3>v. <T3>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, </T3>No. 86-1657 (D.C. Cir. September15, 1989). In this recent opinion, the Court found EPA's approach to bea permissible construction of RCRA. Specifically, the Court held that section3004(m) requires EPA to set treatment standards so that ``threats to humanhealth and the environment are minimized.'' The Court found that this standardprovides EPA flexibility to establish treatment standards that need notbe identical to other regulatory decisions establishing health-based screeninglevels pursuant to different statutory standards. <ITAG tagnum="28">Although the Court found EPA's approach to be permissible, it alsoheld that EPA had not adequately articulated a rationale for the Agency'spolicy choice between a technology-based regime and one which capped treatmentlevels by risk-based screening levels, the Court thus remanded the rule(leaving treatment standards in place) and directed EPA to articulate therationale behind any poIicy choice in this area. EPA is thoroughly studyingthe Court's decision and its own policies to respond to the Court's remand.</ITAG>Significant technical differences and gaps in data, however, can make thetask of utilizing a more expansive view of EPA authority under section3004(m) for characteristic wastes_<T3>i.e., </T3>developing treatment standards that minimize threats belowcharacteristic levels, or that address other toxic constituents_very difficultat this time. The task is not the same as for listed wastes. A listed wastecomprises relatively discrete waste types. EPA often segregates listedwaste into treatability groups to set section 3004(m) standards. Wastesunder a single characteristic designation, however, can cover an enormousrange of waste matrices. Segregating the matrices into treatability groupsis a difficult task even when considering treatment of only the singlecharacteristic property, let alone the treatment of other BDAT list constituents.Moreover, specifying the lowest achievable level that minimizes threatsmay vary from matrix to matrix. As more data are gathered, the Agency maybe in a better  position to consider more constituents, different treatabilitygroups, and more specific or lower treatment standards. There are also significant technical and policy questions which may differentiatethe limits of treatment for wastes with the properties of ignitability,corrosivity, and reactivity, as opposed to those with specific concentrationsof hazardous constituents. The definitions and units of measurement forthe properties ignitability, corrosivity, and reactivity are differentfrom the measurement of EP toxic constituents. For example, EP toxic wastesare defined by a concentration level for a given constituent. Wastes withthe characteristic of ignitability, on the other hand, are defined by aflash point below 60 degrees Celsius, and other narrative descriptions.See 40 CFR 261.21. Similarly, wastes with the characteristic of reactivityare described by narrative standards. See 40 CFR 261.23. It is easy todescribe a lower concentration as a potentially more protective standard.Changing narrative standards, on the other hand, would involve considerablydifferent technical and policy considerations. In today's proposal, EPA is both proposing methods of treatment and proposingconcentration levels for characteristic wastes. Where EPA is proposinga constituent concentration level it is based on the lowest achievablelevel without regard to the characteristic level. Where EPA is proposingmethods of treatment for certain characteristic wastes the Agency believesthat these treatment methods, such as incineration of organics or stabilizationof metals, will also treat some of the other BDAT list constituents whichmay be present. In addition, if a waste is identified as carrying morethan one characteristic, it would need to meet each treatment standardor utilize each method. In light of the above discussion, the Agency requests several types ofcomments. First, commenters should carefully read the technical backgrounddocuments and comment on what they believe to be the lowest achievabletreatment level. Second, commenters should comment on any legal or policyreasons to curtail the treatment requirement at the characteristic level.It may be that the policy considerations make setting standards lower thanthe characteristic level difficult in light of EPA's current regulationsand enforcement mechanisms. These regulations may simply need revision.Thus, EPA may consider providing a final rule which does not go below characteristiclevels as an interim approach until EPA can fully address any significantimplementation problems. Commenters should address the validity of a finalrule which does not require treatment below characteristic levels as apotential interim approach. Finally, commenters should suggest levels beyondwhich there is no further minimization of risks to human health and theenvironment. For some of the EP toxic wastes, the Agency is considering a treatmentlevel higher than the EP toxic level. In this case, if a waste is treatedto meet BDAT, but still exceeds the characteristic level, the waste isstill a RCRA hazardous waste and remains subject to subtitle C regulation.In the event treatment reduces the toxic constituent concentration to belowthe characteristic level, and the waste does not exhibit any other characteristic,the waste is no longer considered a RCRA hazardous waste. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Overlap of Standards for Listed Wastes That Also Exhibit A Characteristic</ITAG>Whichever option EPA chooses, further issues remain regarding situationswhere a waste could be identified for more than one characteristic wastecode, and situations where a listed waste also could be identified forone or more characteristic waste code. In the event a waste could carrymore than one characteristic waste code, the Agency proposes that the wastemust be treated to meet the treatment standard for each characteristic.EPA believes this reading satisfies the goal of significantly reducingwaste toxicity or mobility for the untreated constituent, and consequentlysatisfies the mandate of section 3004(m). If a listed waste could also be identified for one or more characteristicwaste codes, EPA proposes that the waste would have to be treated to meetthe treatment standard for each (of those) waste code(s), with one exception.Under that exception, if the relevant constituents or narrative characteristicsare specifically addressed in the treatment standard for the listed waste,then the standard for the listed waste operates in lieu of the standardfor the relevant characteristics.Thus, if nonwastewater F006 is EP toxic for lead, it would not have tobe treated to meet the EP toxicity lead standard because the treatmentstandard for nonwastewater F006 already contains a standard for lead. Onthe other hand, if the F006 waste were EP toxic for mercury, it would haveto be treated to meet the mercury EP toxicity treatment standard, sincemercury is not addressed in the F006 standard. The general principle EPAis proposing is that the more specific treatment standard takes precedence.Treatment standards for listed wastes are the more specific because theyreflect the Agency's waste-specific determination. This is the same principleEPA adopted with respect to California list wastes that are covered byanother treatment standard, an analogous situation. See 52 FR at 25773,25776 (July 8, 1987). At the same time, when a listed waste exhibits acharacteristic that is not addressed by the listed waste's treatment standard,EPA believes it necessary for that characteristic to be treated to meetthe characteristic treatment standard. To ignore the characteristic wouldmean that the Third Third prohibition for that characteristic is beingignored, and that with respect to that constituent, the waste's toxicityor mobility is either not being reduced or not being minimized. Since thisoutcome would satisfy neither the statutory language nor its policy, EPAis proposing to require treatment. (For the same reason, EPA would alsorequire treatment of listed wastes that are ignitable, reactive, or corrosiveto address the characteristic property.) As with the California list wastes,EPA would apply this principle at the point of generation, since otherwisethe treatment standard for the characteristic constituent could be ignoredby removing the characteristic (assuming the Agency ultimately adopts anapproach whereby treatment standards for characteristic hazardous wastesare lower than the characteristic level). See 52 FR at 25766. EPA notes that under this approach, waste generators must determine notonly whether their waste falls under a prohibition for a listed waste,but also a prohibition for a characteristic. EPA is not proposing any amendedlanguage to andSection; 268.7(a) to require generators to make this examination(<T3>i.e., </T3>determining if the listed waste also exhibits a characteristic)because the existing regulatory language requires the generator to determinethe ``appropriate'' treatment standards (<T3>i.e., </T3>those that are applicable). EPA, however, solicits commenton whether it should promulgate explicit regulatory language in andSection;268.7 (or perhaps in andSection; 262.11) to address this issue. Finally, EPA is proposing to implement one further principle with respectto potential overlap of treatment standards for listed wastes that alsoexhibit a characteristic. This is where the listed waste does not addressa characteristic constituent or property, disposal of a waste which atthe point of disposal exhibits a characteristic is prohibited unless thetreatment level for that characteristic component is above the characteristiclevel. This approach is again essentially the same that EPA adopted forthe analogous situation involving California list wastes (see 52 FR at25767), and is needed to insure that the statutory prohibition againstdisposal of characteristic hazardous wastes is not violated. Although EPAdoes not anticipate that this type of situation will arise often, if itshould, EPA believes that further treatment to address the characteristicwould normally be feasible, and therefore necessary to minimize threatsto human health and the environment. EPA solicits comment on the best implementation mechanism for ensuringagainst disposal of these characteristic wastes. The Agency's preferencewould be for treatment facilities to test, or otherwise determine thatresidues sent to disposal have not somehow acquired a characteristic notpreviously present, and certify that the wastes have not done so. The following examples illustrate the principles involved in the paragraphsabove: <T3>Example 1. </T3>Generator A generates a listed, prohibited waste ``A''which has a wastewater standard for lead of 1 ppm in the TCLP extract.Waste ``A'' is also EP toxic for lead, and the treatment standard for leadcharacteristic wastes (for the sake of this example) is .5 ppm in the TCLPextract. The treatment residue from waste ``A'' is EP toxic for chromium,a constituent not addressed by the standard for the listed waste ``A''.The treatment standard for lead in the wastewater is 1 ppm, because thisis the more specific standard for lead in the waste. However, the treatmentresidue must be treated to meet the treatment standard for chromium beforeit can be disposed, since there is no more specific treatment standardfor that constituent. <T3>Example 2. </T3>Generator B generates a listed waste for which thenonwastewater standard for mercury is 1 ppm. The waste exhibits the EPtoxicity characteristic for mercury, and the treatment standard for thatcharacteristic (for the sake of this example) is a specified treatmentmethod. The more specific treatment standard would still control, even though atreatment method is the standard for the characteristic. Thus, this wastewould have to be treated to below 1 ppm, the numerical limit. EPA solicits comments on the legal and policy implications of the aboveapproach. Moreover, EPA requests comments which discuss mechanisms whichcan provide for enforcement and monitoring of the above scheme.D. Mixed Hazardous/Radioactive Wastes On July 3, 1986 (51 FR 4504), EPA determined that mixed wastes (waste thatsatisfies the definition of radioactive waste subject to the Atomic EnergyAct and contains hazardous waste that is either listed as a hazardous wastein Subpart D of 40 CFR part 261 or exhibits any of the hazardous wastecharacteristics identified in Subpart C of 40 CFR part 261) were subjectto the RCRA regulations. This created a dual regulatory framework for mixedwastes because the hazardous component would be regulated under RCRA, andthe radioactive component would be regulated under the Atomic Energy Act(AEA). RCRA applies to all radioactive mixed waste, independent of theclassification of the radioactive component as low level, high level, ortransuranic, but only to the hazardous portions of the mixed waste stream.Statutorily and administratively, the management of the radioactive componentdiffers. While EPA may develop ambient health and environmental standards,the specific standards for radioactive material management developed underthe Atomic Energy Act are administered through the Department of Energy(DOE) for government-owned facilities, and through regulations of the NuclearRegulatory Commission (NRC) for commercially owned facilities. There are approximately 30 DOE installations that generate mixed waste.Of these, 13 generate the majority of waste containing low-level, high-level,and transuranic radionuclides. These installations have complex and diversewaste management facilities and generally have RCRA interim status. Thesite audits, sampling, and analytical studies that have been performedby DOE at these sites provide some information to characterize the mixedwastes. Approximately 26,000 NRC licensees, including hospitals, universities,and nuclear power plants, generate mixed waste. The radioactive componentof this mixed waste primarily consists of low-level radionuclides. Theprincipal RCRA hazardous constituents include solvents, lead, chromium,and other hazardous constituents generated by the biomedical and nuclearpower industries. It is estimated that commercially generated mixed wasteconstitutes about 2 to 30 percent of the low-level radioactive waste generatedannually. There are not adequate government or commercial facilities permitted byboth NRC and EPA to dispose of mixed waste. As a result, much of the mixedwaste is being managed by either recycling (<T3>e.g.,</T3> mixed wastes containing lead) or incineration, (<T3>e.g.,</T3> scintillation cocktails containing solvents). Most mixedwaste is being stored by generators, who require a RCRA permit for storagebeyond 90 days. As noted in section III-B above, after reviewing data collected in theNational Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, Disposal, and RecyclingFacilities, the Agency has determined that there is inadequate nationwidecapacity available for mixed wastes. Therefore, EPA is proposing to granta two-year national capacity variance under section 3004(h)(2) for thescheduled wastes. Since adequate treatment capacity is not expected tobe available immediately, these wastes will continue to be stored. Mixedwastes containing listed hazardous waste are expected to be generated insmall volumes. Larger volumes of mixed wastes which contain spent solventsand EP toxic metals, such as lead and chromium, are expected to be generated.Mixed wastes containing spent solvents or dioxins, or that are Californialist wastes, are still subject to the applicable treatment standards oncethe effective date has passed. For mixed wastes containing certain spentsolvents and dioxins, or that are California list wastes, the Agency mayalso consider petitions for one-year extensions of the effective date.HSWA provides a maximum of two one-year extensions under section 3004(h)(3).Such extensions are determined on a case-by-case basis after consultationwith appropriate State agencies, and public notice and comment. The Agency is performing studies to characterize the mixed waste volumes,characteristics, and treatment options. The Agency also expects to receivetreatment data for mixed waste from DOE for review. DOE has been studyinghow to treat, store, and dispose of waste at its sites. Once received,such data will be made available for public notice and comment. E. Applicability of Today's Proposed Rule to Mineral Processing WastesSection 3001(b)(3)(A)(ii) of RCRA excludes from the hazardous waste regulations(pending completion of studies by the Agency) solid wastes from the extraction,beneficiation and processing of ores and minerals. On September 1, 1989,EPA published a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 36592) that narrowed the scope of thistemporary exclusion as it applies to mineral processing operations to 25enumerated wastes that meet the exclusion criteria of ``high volume/lowhazard,'' as specified in the September 1 rule. EPA determined that fivespecific mineral processing wastes clearly remain within the scope of theexclusion, and that 20 additional specified mineral processing wastes remainwithin the exclusion, pending collection of further volume and hazard data.All previously excluded mineral processing wastes, other than these 25specified wastes, that exhibit one or more of the characteristics of hazardouswaste will no longer be excluded from the hazardous waste regulations whenthe final rule becomes effective. (On September 25, 1989 (see 54 FR 39298-39318),EPA proposed to remove an additional 7 of these wastes from the exclusionbased on additional volume and/or hazard data.) EPA believes that the wastes are ``newly identified'' for the purposesof determining applicability of the land disposal prohibitions. Althoughtechnically the wastes are not being identified by a new characteristic,they are being brought into the subtitle C system after the date of enactmentof the HSWA on November 8, 1984. The clear sense of RCRA section 3004(g)(4)is that wastes brought into the system after the 1984 RCRA amendments areto be prohibited from land disposal under a potentially different schedulethan those wastes that were hazardous on the date of enactment of HSWA,and are not to be subject to the statutory hard hammer. Because these wastesare newly identified, the Agency must develop treatment standards for themwithin six months of their being identified as hazardous wastes (RCRA section3004(g)(4)(C)). However, as stated above, these wastes are hazardous because they exhibitone or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste. Today's rule proposestreatment standards for characteristic wastes. The question, therefore,is whether the treatment standards for characteristics should apply tothese mineral processing wastes recently determined not to fall withinthe Bevill exclusion. Put another way, although as newly identified wastesthey are not subject to the hard hammer, EPA still has the choice of whetheror not to apply the treatment standards for characteristic wastes to themat this time. The Agency has not yet performed the technical analyses necessary to determineif the treatment standards proposed today as BDAT for EP toxic hazardouswastes can be achieved in treating the various mineral processing wastes.Therefore, EPA is proposing that these newly identified mineral processingwastes <T3>not </T3>be subject to the BDAT standards proposed today for characteristichazardous wastes. The Agency plans to study the mineral processing wastesin the near future to determine BDAT for these newly identified hazardouswastes. EPA also solicits comment on whether the BDATs proposed today forthe EP toxic metals are appropriate for the newly identified mineral processingwastes. Commenters should provide data showing whether particular miningwastes can be treated to meet the proposed standards. There are circumstances when newly identified mineral processing wastescan, however, be subject to existing hazardous waste prohibitions. Thus,if the mineral processing waste is mixed with other prohibited wastes (<T3>i.e., </T3>any prohibited solvent, dioxin, First or Second Third hazardouswaste), it becomes subject to the prohibition for the prohibited wastewith which it is mixed. EPA also is soliciting comment on the applicabilityof California list prohibitions to newly identified and listed hazardouswastes. See section III.M below. Whether any of these prohibitions would have immediate regulatory effectwould be determined by the authorization status of the State in which thewaste is managed. Because the final rule removing wastes from the scopeof the Bevill exclusion is not being adopted pursuant to HSWA, it doesnot take effect immediately in authorized States. Thus, in these States,these mineral processing wastes would only be hazardous wastes if theyare included within the scope of the State's authorized program. If theyare not, they would not be hazardous wastes until an amended State's programincluding them is authorized. Only after authorization would the land disposalprohibitions apply in that State. These mineral processing wastes wouldbe hazardous wastes in unauthorized States as soon as the rule removingthem from the exclusion becomes effective. At that time, any land disposalprohibitions that apply to them also would take effect.F. Clarification of ``P'' and ``U'' Solid WastesEPA is proposing amendments to clarify the existing language of 40 CFR261.33. The first amendment involves andSection; 261.33(c), a provision thatlists residues from containers and inner liners of containers that haveheld commercial chemical products listed in andSection; 261.33(e). This languageis partially in error in that it does not also include residues and innerliners contaminated with the andSection; 261.33(f) materials. All of theother provisions in 40 CFR 261.33 refer to both andSection; 261.33 (e) and(f) wastes, and there is no reason that andSection; 261.33(c) should notas well. The omission results in fact from an oversight, and is not basedon any choice by the Agency. EPA is also proposing a change to clarify when contaminated soil, water,and spill debris contaminated with 40 CFR 261.33 (e) and (f) materialscan be solid wastes. Ordinarily, andSection; 261.33 materials are solid wastesonly when ``discarded'' by being abandoned, or by being burned or placedon the land when this is not the materials' normal manner of use (see firstsentence of andSection; 261.33). Thus, these materials are not normally classifiedas RCRA solid wastes when they are recycled. See andSection; 261.2(c) andTable 1. Contaminated spill residues, water, and debris resulting fromclean-up actions normally result from the abandonment of andSection; 261.33materials that have been spilled on land or water, remained there, andeventually necessitate clean-up. Certainly, the reasons behind the statementthat andSection; 261.33 materials are not solid wastes when recycled_theirnear product-like status due to being unused commercial chemical productsand their easy means of recycling_do not apply to contaminated soils andother contaminated clean-up residues covered by andSection; 261.33(d). Notonly are these materials difficult to recycle and not product-like, butdelaying their classification as solid wastes to the moment when a determinationas to recycling is made could encourage uncontrolled or haphazard spillingof these materials onto land or water, and discourage their clean-up. Although such spilled materials already may be considered to be abandoned,the Agency is proposing to amend the rules to make clear that spill residues,and other materials covered by andSection; 261.33(d), are considered to besolid wastes. There could conceivably, however, be some circumstances whena material can be spilled and the contaminated soil or water matrix couldbe quickly returned to production. EPA believes that some allowance oughtto be made for such situations to avoid interfering with production-relatedspills that can be returned to the process, or otherwise put to directuse, in a short time. The maximum period for which a spill residue couldbe returned to the process would appear to be 90 days. This is the maximumlength of accumulation time the Agency has recognized, in other contexts,as providing a legitimate accommodation between avoiding disruption withproduction decisions versus the environmental protection afforded underthe RCRA permit process. See 40 CFR 262.34 and 45 FR 12730 (February 26,1980). Thus, under the clarified proposed regulation, unless contaminatedsoils or other andSection; 261.33(d) residues are recycled within 90 daysof the spill, they would be considered to be solid wastes even if thereis a bona fide intent to recycle. Absent a bona fide intent to recycle,the materials are solid wastes immediately upon being spilled because theyhave been abandoned. The person claiming that spill residues are not solidwastes would have the burden of showing that the spill will be recycledand that recycling has occurred within the specified period (see 40 CFR261.2(f)_the Agency's <T3>prima facie </T3>case is established by the fact of the spill itself,which is a type of disposal). In addition, any andSection; 261.33(d) materialthat is not recycled is being disposed, thus triggering all of the SubtitleC requirements for hazardous wastes that are disposed. See 50 FR 28712-713(July 15, 1985). EPA further solicits comment on whether the spill residues should automaticallycontinue to be considered solid wastes if they are removed after 90 daysfor legitimate recycling (even if the spill area itself would be a regulatedunit after that time). For example, if the spill residue were to be usedas a feedstock in an industrial process, then should the spill residuestill be considered to be a solid waste once it is removed? (Cf. 40 CFR261.1(c)(8), final sentence, noting that materials that are accumulatedspeculatively do not necessarily remain solid wastes once they are removedfrom accumulation.) EPA also solicits comment on whether such spill residuesshould be considered to be inherently waste-like pursuant to andSection;261.2(d), in which case they would remain solid wastes regardless of theirmethod of subsequent recycling. G. Determining When Dilution Is Permissible EPA believes that its existing rules regarding impermissible dilution ofprohibited wastes require further clarification when applied to situationsinvolving aggregation for centralized treatment of more than one waste.By way of background, current regulations provide that wastes that areprohibited from land disposal may not be diluted ``* * * as a substitutefor adequate treatment to achieve compliance with [a treatment standard]* * *,  to circumvent the effective date of a prohibition. * * *, to otherwiseavoid a prohibition * * *, or to circumvent a [statutory] prohibition.* * *'' (see andSection; 268.3). Section 268.41(b), which was added as ameans of making this dilution prohibition workable (see 51 FR 40623, Nov.7, 1986), states that `` * * * when wastes with differing treatment standardsfor a constituent of concern are combined for purposes of treatment, thetreatment residue must meet the lowest treatment standard for the constituentof concern.'' EPA has further stated in preambles that not all dilution of prohibitedwastes is impermissible, and acknowledged a number of times that dilutionthat occurs as a necessary part of the process to treat a waste is permissible.51 FR 40592 (Nov. 7, 1986); see also 54 FR 26601-602 (June 23, 1989). EPAhas also indicated that certain forms of treatment that result in phaseseparations that make each phase easier to treat can be permissible formsof treatment. 53 FR 31145 (August 17, 1988) and 54 FR 26603, 26612 (June23, 1989).The Agency's concern, echoing Congress' concern in indicating that dilutionto avoid proper treatment was impermissible (H.R. Rep. No. 198, Part I,98th Cong., 1st Sess. 38 (1983)), is that individual prohibited wastesnot be mixed with larger volumes of other wastes (whether prohibited ornot) to meet treatment standards without undergoing treatment that substantiallyreduces the prohibited wastes' toxicity or mobility. Another of the Agency'sobjectives is that heavily concentrated streams amenable to a particulartype of treatment technology should be segregated for treatment by thattechnology rather than being aggregated for less appropriate treatmentthat does not substantially reduce the waste's toxicity or mobility. See52 FR 25766, middle column (July 8, 1987).Consequently, it appears to the Agency that any dilution that fails tomeet the standard in andSection; 3004(m) of substantially reducing the prohibitedwaste's toxicity or mobility is impermissible. To achieve this objective,the Agency believes that there must be some actual reduction in the toxicityor mobility of at least one BDAT constituent in each prohibited waste thatis treated, to the extent that these constituents are present in initialconcentrations that exceed the treatment standard for that prohibited waste.Further, with respect to organic constituents, ``reduction in toxicity''means actual removal of or chemical change to the constituent.The following examples illustrate how the Agency would apply this interpretation:Example 1. Facility A mixes a small volume of prohibited nonwastewatercontaining five percent TOC with a larger volume of wastewaters containingless than one percent TOC. The wastes all contain organic BDAT constituents,but the only treatment the mixture undergoes is for removal of total suspendedsolids, not for removal of the organic constituents. The treatment systemgenerates a nonwastewater and wastewater treatment residue. The nonwastewateris treated further to achieve BDAT. The wastewater meets the treatmentstandard for wastewaters.EPA views this situation as involving impermissible dilution because thetreatment system is not removing BDAT constituents, but simply dilutingthem, such that they are below a BDAT level. Moreover, the initial nonwastewaterordinarily would be amenable to direct treatment and need not be mixed.The result is simply the dilution of the initial nonwastewater. Cf. 53FR 31145 (Aug. 17, 1988) (``* * * a facility is not allowed to dilute orperform partial treatment on a waste in order to switch the applicabilityof a nonwastewater standard to a wastewater standard or vice versa.'').Example 2. Facility B generates a prohibited nonwastewater that is a bi-layeredwaste with an organic phase and a liquid phase. The BDAT constituent inthe waste is cyanide. These phases can be separated by skimming the organicphase, after which the nonwastewater organic phase is amenable to incinerationtreatment and the wastewater phase to wastewater treatment. Instead ofdoing so, generator B mixes the waste with other wastewaters and generatesa wastewater that meets all cyanide treatment standards, although cyanideis not being removed by the treatment system.This example also involves impermissible dilution due to the lack of removalof the BDAT constituent.EPA solicits comment on this issue, and asks that commenters provide specificexamples where they believe that aggregation for centralized treatmentis legitimate even if some dilution is involved. EPA also notes, as recentlyexplained in a correction notice to the First Third final regulation, thatthe dilution prohibition in andSection; 268.3 generally only applies to prohibitedwastes disposed via a prohibited form of land disposal. See 54 FR 36967-36972(September 6, 1989). In applying this principle, one looks to the treatabilitygroup that is generated and ascertains whether that treatability groupis destined for management in a prohibited form of land disposal. For example,if a generator generates a hazardous wastewater that is being mixed intanks before discharge to a POTW or to waters of the United States, thewastewater is not a prohibited hazardous waste, and the dilution prohibitionwould not apply to it. (If non-wastewaters are derived from the managementof the wastewater, those non-wastewaters are prohibited hazardous wastesbecause they are destined for a prohibited form of land disposal.) On theother hand, if the wastewater were to be managed in any type of surfaceimpoundment before its discharge, it would be a prohibited hazardous waste,and the dilution prohibition would apply.Of course, even where one BDAT constituent is treated to reduce its toxicityor mobility, impermissible dilution might occur. For example, a waste withtreatable concentrations of metals as well as extremely high concentrationsof hazardous organics could be mixed with large volumes of other metal-bearingwastes for metals treatment. To the extent that the high concentrationsof organics are diluted by this treatment to below treatable levels, thiswould constitute impermissible dilution if there is an appropriate organicstreatment technology that could be applied prior to metals treatment. Inthis example, there is an actual reduction in the toxicity or mobilityof one BDAT constituent, but dilution to avoid treating organics.Thus, the requirement that one BDAT constituent be treated so as to substantiallyreduce its toxicity or mobility is a minimum requirement in all cases.It should not be interpreted as validating all other dilution that mayoccur.H. Other Dilution Issues The second major issue regarding dilution on which EPA is soliciting commentis whether dilution can be used as a means of supplanting a section 3004(m)treatment standard by being used to render a prohibited waste non-hazardousin lieu of actually treating the prohibited hazardous waste prior to landdisposal. The issue is most pressing with respect to wastes that exhibita characteristic of hazardous waste, but can also arise with respect tolisted wastes for which delisting is sought. EPA believes that the standards of section 3004(m) apply to all wastesdestined for a prohibited form of land disposal. It is not permissibleto dilute a waste to render it nonhazardous in lieu of proper treatmentunder section 3004(m) (unless dilution is a part of proper treatment undersection 3004(m)). With respect to dilution of characteristic hazardous wastes, EPA is clearlygiven authority to establish treatment standards for hazardous wastes thatexhibit a characteristic. RCRA section 3004(g)(4)(C). This authority includesprescribing methods of treatment for characteristic hazardous wastes. Section3004(m) (1) and (2). Yet this authority would be largely meaningless ifa person could dilute the waste to remove the characteristic rather thantreating it (even assuming EPA determines that treatment standards arebounded jurisdictionally by characteristic levels). The same reasoningholds true for listed wastes, except it is more difficult to remove listedwastes from the subtitle C system because delisting requires an administrativedetermination. Nevertheless, the possibility exists for evading a treatmentstandard for a listed waste by diluting the waste and seeking a delisting.The legislative history of HSWA clearly indicates Congress' intention thatdilution not be used as a substitute for treatment standards of the landdisposal restrictions program promulgated pursuant to RCRA section 3004(m).The legislative history further indicates that a prohibition of this typeof dilution ``is particularly important where regulations are based onconcentrations of hazardous constituents.'' (H.R. Rep. No. 198, Part I,98th Cong., 1st Sess. 38 (1983)). This is consistent with the overall policyof requiring hazardous wastes to be <T3>treated </T3>before they are land disposed. EPA therefore is of the view that it is illegal to render a prohibitedwaste non-hazardous by engaging in impermissible dilution. An importantissue raised by this proposal is the relation of the section 3004 treatmentstandards and corollary dilution prohibition and the rules implementingRCRA section 3001 that define a hazardous waste. These rules do not prohibitdilution to remove a hazardous waste characteristic or to achieve a delistinglevel. See andSection;andSection; 261.3(d)(1) and 260.22 (c) and (d). EPA doesnot intend to address today the broad question about whether dilution shouldever be allowed as a means of rendering a waste non-hazardous. (Were theAgency to regulate such dilution, it might do so based on concerns aboutmass loadings of hazardous constituents and the statutory preference forproper treatment of hazardous wastes, as well as the statutory goal ofwaste minimization.) Rather, today's proposal is limited to a context wherethe land disposal prohibitions apply and is intended to preserve the integrityof treatment standards for prohibited hazardous wastes. Consequently, under the rules proposed today, if an impermissible formof dilution occurs that renders a toxic hazardous waste non-hazardous,the act of dilution would be illegal but the waste would be non-hazardousfor subsequent management purposes. That is, EPA is not today redefininghazardous waste, but is instead imposing a condition on how hazardous wastescan be managed. Thus, penalties for impermissibly diluting a prohibitedhazardous waste could include fines and injunctive relief such as diggingup the waste and treating it properly. However, a unit receiving a dilutedwaste which is no longer defined as hazardous would not become a regulatedunit subject to subtitle C regulation. EPA solicits comment on this approach, and also on the broader questionof whether the Agency should approach this question as a section 3001 issuerelating to whether certain impermissibly diluted hazardous wastes wouldstill be considered to be hazardous in order to reduce mass loadings oftoxic constituents. EPA is also interested in comments on what mechanismthe Agency should use to determine whether a hazardous waste is to be managedby means other than land disposal, and is thus able to be diluted. EPA realizes that this interpretation could require some changes in existinghazardous waste management practices, particularly for wastewaters thatexhibit a hazardous waste characteristic and that are diluted to removethe characteristic before reaching a land disposal unit. To the extentsuch wastewater streams are small volume, they could be drummed for off-sitetreatment or treated on a batch basis. Larger volume wastewaters couldrequire segregated pretreatment. It appears to the Agency that that isa necessary corollary of prohibiting dilution of prohibited hazardous wastes.EPA solicits comment, however, on the volumes of wastes that may be affectedand the availability of treatment for waste streams that may need to bediverted. In addition, the Agency solicits comment on whether the reasonsfor the dilution prohibition apply equally to the non-toxic characteristichazardous wastes or whether dilution should be considered to be a permissibletype of treatment in some circumstances for these wastes (see the earlierdiscussion in section III.A.5 regarding the Agency's reasons for believingthat such dilution is not appropriate treatment).I. Storage Prohibition Section 3004(j) provides that storage of prohibited hazardous wastes isitself prohibited ``unless such storage is solely for the purpose of theaccumulation of such quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary tofacilitate proper recovery, treatment or disposal.'' This language appliesonly to storage of prohibited wastes in non-land based storage units (liketanks and containers), land-based storage being a type of disposal. The intent of RCRA section 3004(j) and 40 CFR 268.50 is to prohibit useof long-term storage to circumvent treatment requirements imposed by theLDRs. 129 Cong. Rec. H8139 (daily ed. October 6, 1983. As the court recentlystated in <T3>Hazardous Waste Treatment Council </T3>v. <T3>EPA </T3>(``<T3>HWTC III</T3>'') (No. 86-1657, D.C. Cir. September 15, 1989):<ITAG tagnum="21">Congress believed that permitting storage of large quantities of wasteas a means of forestalling treatment would involve health threats equallyserious to those posed by land disposal, and therefore opted in large partfor a ``treat as you go'' regulatory regime.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Slip op. at 5. No firm time limit is established. Generators and owners or operators canstore as long as necessary if such storage is solely for the purpose statedabove. However, if prohibited wastes are stored beyond one year, the owner/operatorhas the burden of proving (in the event of an enforcement action) thatsuch storage is for the allowable reason; prior to one year, EPA maintainsthe burden of proving that storage has occurred for the wrong reason. Because EPA is aware of concerns that some legitimate storage technicallymay be prohibited under the current approach, the Agency is requestingcomment on alternative approaches for prohibiting storage. Under one alternative,where prohibited wastes are stored in tanks or containers pending the utilizationof proper treatment, recovery or disposal capacity, the storage would notbe prohibited. Two examples of allowable storage under this alternativeapproach are provided below: (1) Where a generator is storing wastes in tanks for six weeks becauseof a backup at an incinerator which the generator has a contract to use;and (2) Where a treatment facility treats a prohibited waste to a level thatdoes not meet the treatment standard and then stores the waste before treatingit again to meet the standard. EPA is soliciting views on these issues today because a literal readingof the statute would likely condemn such storage as unlawful. This is becausethe statutory language and 40 CFR 268.50 draw a connection between theamount of waste being stored and the purpose of facilitating proper management.Virtually no storage except that undertaken to promote under-utilized propermanagement capacity would satisfy this literal reading of the provision.EPA recognizes that under the alternative approach proposed today, thephrase ``utilization of proper treatment, recovery or disposal capacity''would need to be further defined. The Agency also seeks comment on howa temporal element might be added to the phrase ``pending the utilization* * * '' in order to define the limits of the proposed approach. Accordingly, EPA is soliciting comment on the alternative interpretation(<T3>i.e </T3>that the storage prohibition only applies if storage is surrogatedisposal, for example due to failure to utilize existing treatment capacity,or if storage is otherwise undertaken for purposes of evading a land disposalprohibition). Commenters should also address other potential situationswhere they believe that an overly literal reading of section 3004(j) mayhave consequences they believe Congress did not intend. J. Generator Notification Requirements The generator notification requirements set forth in 40 CFR 268.7 specifythat when the generator has determined, either through testing or throughknowledge of the waste, that the waste is restricted and does not meetthe applicable treatment standards, the generator must, with each shipmentof waste, notify the treatment facility in writing of the appropriate treatmentstandards. This notice must include the EPA Hazardous Waste Number, thecorresponding treatment standards and all applicable prohibitions set forthin andSection; 268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d), the manifest number associatedwith the shipment of waste, and waste analysis data, where available (40CFR 268.7(a)(1)). If the generator has determined that the waste beingshipped is restricted, but can be land disposed without further treatment,he must submit to the land disposal facility the same information, as wellas a certification stating that the waste meets the applicable treatmentstandards (40 CFR 268.7(a)(2)). The Agency has had a number of questions on whether the actual treatmentstandards (<T3>i.e., </T3>the actual number or method) must be placed on the generatornotification form, or if it is sufficient to reference the appropriatetreatment standards by citation to the applicable part of 40 CFR 268.41,.42, or .43. EPA's interpretation has been that all applicable treatmentstandards must be listed completely on the generator notification formsent to the treatment, storage or disposal facility. A number of commentershave indicated that they believe the current regulations can be interpretedto allow referencing, rather than listing the specific treatment standardsas part of the generator notification. The commenters argue that referencingthe standards serves the same purpose as listing the specific treatmentstandards. Furthermore, they find that the notification forms are becominglonger, more complicated, and unwieldy as new wastes and correspondingtreatment standards are added to the list of wastes restricted from landdisposal, and thus pose a burden on the generator when each treatment standardmust be listed on the notification form. The Agency is considering changing the interpretation of andSection; 268.7to allow referencing the treatment standards. The following informationwould be included in the reference: EPA Hazardous Waste Number, the treatabilitygroup(s) of the waste(s) (<T3>e.g., </T3>wastewater or non-wastewater), and the CFR section wherethe treatment standards appear. This information replaces only the listingof the applicable treatment standards; all other information would stillbe required in the notification. EPA is soliciting comment on this proposedre-interpretation to determine if the regulated community anticipates anyproblems with allowing the option of referencing the treatment standards,and to determine the effect this action would have on hazardous waste generators.In addition, some commenters have raised concerns about notification requirementsin andSection; 268.7, particularly shipments subject to the March 24, 1986small quantity generator (SQG) rule. This rule exempts SQGs (100-1000 kg/mo.)with tolling agreements (as defined in 40 CFR 262.20(e)) from the fullpart 262 manifesting requirements pursuant to 40 CFR 262.20(e). EPA isproposing to amend andSection; 268.7 to require a one-time notification andcertification for SQG shipments subject to tolling agreements. Such agreements,as well as the one-time notifications and certifications, must be maintainedby the generator for five years in keeping with the five-year retentionperiod established in the First Third rule. The Agency is proposing this amendment because it believes the subsequenthandler of the waste under the contractual tolling arrangement has sufficientnotification and knowledge of the nature of the wastes being handled. Tollingagreements provide for the collection and reclamation of a specified wasteand for redelivery of regenerated material at a specified frequency. TheAgency believes that since the same waste is picked up at regular intervals,one notice will suffice for the duration of the agreement to apprise thesubsequent handler of the land disposal restrictions applicable to thewaste.K. Modification to the Framework: Waste Analysis Plans and Treatment/DisposalFacility Testing Requirements Treatment and disposal facilities managing prohibited hazardous wastesmust test the wastes for compliance with treatment standards at a frequencyspecified in the facility's waste analysis plan (andSection;andSection; 268.7(b) and (c)). The waste analysis plan must be sufficient to comply withall requirements of part 268 (andSection; 264.13(a)(1)).A comment in section 264.13(a)(2) states that `` * * * the owner or operatorof an off-site facility may arrange for the generator of the hazardouswaste to supply part or all of the [waste analysis] information requiredby paragraph (a)(1) of this section.'' This language has been mistakenlyconstrued to preclude requiring the owner or operator of a treatment orland disposal facility to conduct a detailed chemical and physical analysisof a representative sample of the waste at a specific rate of frequency,without regard to whether information supplied by the generator is sufficientto assure compliance with part 268. Although there are certainly situationswhere the data submitted by the generator, or the knowledge of the generator,may constitute an essential part of the necessary information, the Agencyis today proposing to amend the rules to more clearly specify the circumstanceswhen EPA may require the owner or operator of a treatment or disposal facilityto conduct such testing.The Agency believes that, ordinarily, treatment and disposal facilitiesshould do some corroborative testing to ensure compliance with treatmentstandards. This is because a crosscheck that treatment has been conductedsuccessfully is needed to ensure that ultimate disposal does not violatethe statute and regulations. Corroborative testing will maximize the likelihoodof ultimate disposal being legal. The testing will also provide usefulrecords for ascertaining compliance. The Agency does not have the resourcesto perform such facility-by-facility testing itself; thus, the normal situationshould be that treatment and disposal facilities should do some independenttesting of prohibited wastes, even if the generator also tests or otherwisecertifies. See <T3>Hazardous Waste Treatment Council </T3>v. <T3>EPA </T3>(No. 86-1657, D.C. Cir. September 15, 1989) (slip op. pp.31-2) finding it reasonable for EPA to require treatment and disposal facilitiesto do back-up testing.The Agency further believes that the frequency of testing is best determinedon a case-by-case basis by the permit writer. This is because the rangeof variables (e.g., variety of wastes treated, different types of matrices,number of treatment processes involved) is too broad to realistically evaluateon a national level. Allowing permit writers to make the determinationas to frequency of testing as part of the waste analysis plan allows maximumflexibility to take individual facility's circumstances into account, andso clearly appears to EPA to be the correct way to proceed. The Agencyis seeking comment on the following two approaches that would specify thecircumstances under which EPA may require testing.The first approach is to amend the comment in 40 CFR 264.13(a)(2) to specifythat the owner or operator of an off-site facility may arrange for thegenerator of the hazardous waste to supply part or all of the waste analysisinformation only if an EPA-approved waste analysis plan affirmatively allowsthe generator to supply this information. Further, the Agency is proposingto amend andSection;andSection; 268.7 (b) and (c) to reflect this change. SpecificalIy,the Agency is specifying that the frequency with which the owner or operatoris required by the Regional Administrator or his designee to test willbe based on, but not limited to, the criteria included in andSection; 264.13.EPA believes that today's amendment only clarifies existing requirements,since the waste analysis plan regulations already require that the plansbe adequate to ensure compliance with part 268, and EPA considers it unlikelythat a plan requiring no testing at all could adequately ensure such compliance.If EPA selects this option in the final rule, the sentence in the andSection;261.13(a)(2) comment that allows the owner or operator of an interim statusfacility to arrange for the generator to supply part or all of the wasteanalysis information will be deleted because waste analysis plans for interimstatus facilities are self-implementing, and approval by EPA is not required.Consequently, under this approach, interim status facilities would no longerbe able to rely on the generator's knowledge of the waste.The second approach also seeks maximum flexibility to take into accountindividual facilities' circumstances by providing that, for purposes ofcompliance with part 268, testing frequency will be determined by the RegionalAdministrator or his designate, but requires that owners/operators of treatmentand disposal facilities must conduct waste analyses a minimum of once eachyear. Under this approach, the requirement to obtain a detailed chemicaland physical analysis of a representative sample of the waste (andSection;andSection;264.13(a)(1) and 265.13(a)(1)), would be revised to require owners/operatorsof treatment and disposal facilities to conduct detailed chemical and physicalanalyses of a representative sample, and to do so a minimum of once eachyear. In addition, andSection; 268.7 (b) and (c) would be revised to reflectthis change. The Agency notes that this second approach would be self-implementing,and would not require revision to existing permits. The Agency also notesthat the Regional Administrator or his designate would have the discretionto require more frequent testing in the waste analysis plan based on site-specificcircumstances. The Agency believes that the testing being proposed underthe second approach is already being conducted by the regulated communitysince the current waste analysis plan regulations require the plans tobe adequate to ensure compliance with part 268. Therefore, although a minimumtesting frequency is being established under the second approach, the Agencydoes not believe that any new requirements are actually being imposed uponthe regulated community.L. Testing of Wastes Treated in 90-Day Tanks or ContainersUnder andSection; 268.7(b), treatment facilities treating prohibited hazardouswastes must test the treatment residues that they generate at a frequencydetermined by their waste analysis plan in order to ascertain compliancewith the applicable treatment standards. All treatment facilities operatingpursuant to interim status or a full permit must have a waste analysisplan.There is a regulatory gap, however, with respect to treatment of prohibitedwastes that is conducted in so-called 90 day tanks (or containers) regulatedunder andSection; 262.34. This is because such tanks (or containers) arenot subject to a waste analysis plan requirement. Thus, there is presentlyno regulatory vehicle for determining testing frequency in such circumstances(although the existing testing requirement obviously applies, and continuesto apply, to persons conducting treatment of prohibited wastes in andSection;262.34 tanks and containers).In order to close this regulatory gap, EPA is proposing today that personstreating prohibited wastes in andSection; 262.34 tanks and containers mustprepare a plan justifying the frequency of testing that they choose toadopt. This plan would be based on a detailed chemical and physical analysisof a representative sample of the prohibited waste(s) being treated, andmust contain all information necessary to treat the waste(s) in accordancewith requirements of part 268 (this language is drawn from the standardfor waste analysis plans in andSection;andSection; 264.13 and 265.13), includingthe selected testing frequency. The plan would be self-implementing, inthe sense that there is no requirement of prior approval from any regulatoryentity. There would, however, be a requirement that the plan be retainedas a facility record, where it would serve as the means of justifying toenforcement officials why the frequency of testing selected by the facilityis reasonable. Examples of factors EPA would expect to be included in theplan would be discussion of the number of prohibited wastes treated, theirvariability, and the variability of the treatment process.M. Relation of California List Prohibitions to Other Standards and EffectiveDates One further issue meriting discussion is what remains of the Californialist regulatory and statutory prohibitions after promulgation of the ThirdThird final rule. The Agency has already indicated that California listprohibitions are superseded by more specific prohibitions and treatmentstandards. See 52 FR 29993 (August 12, 1987) and 52 FR 25773 (July 8, 1987);see also 40 CFR 268.32(h) (HOC prohibition superseded by treatment standardand effective date for a particular HOC). Thus, almost all of the Californialist prohibitions will be superseded when the Third Third rule is promulgated.The only continued applicability of the California list appears to be for:(1) Liquid hazardous wastes that contain over 50 ppm PCBs, where PCBs arenot regulated by the treatment standard; (2) HOC-containing wastes identifiedas hazardous by a characteristic property that does not involve HOCs, as,for example, an ignitable waste that also contains greater than 1000 ppmHOCs (but not an EP toxic waste that exhibits the characteristic becauseit contains one of the six chlorinated organic pesticides covered by theEP toxicity characteristic or for liquid wastes that exhibit the EP toxicitycharacteristic for metals and also contain greater than California listmetal concentrations); and (3) liquid hazardous wastes that exhibit a characteristicand also contain over 134 mg/1 of nickel and/or 130 mg/1 of thallium. Asdiscussed in detail below, California list prohibitions also normally applyduring national capacity variance periods for wastes in the First, Second,or Third Third. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Applicability of California List Prohibitions During Capacity VariancesBased on Superseding Standards </ITAG>The Agency has previously indicated that California list regulatory andstatutory prohibitions are superseded by more specific prohibitions andtreatment standards. See 52 FR 29993 (August 12, 1987), 52 FR 25773 (July8, 1987) and 53 FR 31187 (August 17, 1988); see also 40 CFR 268.32(h) (HOCprohibition superseded by treatment standard and effective date for a particularHOC). The Agency continues to believe this general approach is appropriate.In order to make clear to the regulated community the implications of theCalifornia list for the Third Third prohibitions (particularly characteristicwastes) and effective dates, the Agency wishes to reiterate how this approachoperates during the period of a national capacity variance for a wastesubject to a superseding standard. As established in the First Third final rule, more specific standards supersedethe California list prohibitions only after the actual effective date ofthe more waste-specific prohibition. During the period of any capacityvariance for the more specific waste, however, the California list prohibitionwould continue to apply. See 53 FR 31188 (August 17, 1988). As discussedbelow, the Agency believes this approach avoids having a window of timewhere the waste is not subject to any standards. In some cases, this approachalso avoids situations of the Agency effectively granting a capacity varianceof over two years to certain California list wastes. As an example, the prohibition on surface disposal of California list mercurywastes above 20 mg/1 level was in effect on July 8, 1987 and would be ineffect on August 8, 1990 for injected wastes. See 52 FR 25760 (July 8,1987); 40 CFR 148.12(b). Today, EPA is proposing BDAT methods and standardsfor wastes exhibiting the characteristic of EP toxicity for mercury andproposing a two-year national capacity variance for both certain surfacedisposed and injected wastes. BDATs for other wastes may also specificallyaddress treatment of mercury. Under EPA's current approach, these supersedingBDAT standards would take effect after the date of the capacity variance.During the period of any variance, however, the California list prohibitionwould remain in effect, so that liquid wastes containing greater than 20mg/1 of mercury could not be land disposed. As another example, EPA has previously provided a two-year capacity variancefor injected wastes subject to the California list prohibition on liquidhazardous wastes with pH less than 2. See 52 FR 30908 (August 10, 1988).The effective date for this California list prohibition for injected wastesis August 8, 1990. Today, EPA is proposing to set neutralization to a pHlevel in the range of 6 to 9 as the BDAT standard for wastes which exhibitthe characteristic of corrosivity under 40 CFR 261.22. EPA is also proposinga national capacity variance to May 8, 1992, for injected corrosive wastes,but is proposing no capacity variance for corrosive wastes disposed insurface units. Under the Agency's current approach, injected California list waste witha pH of less than 2 would be prohibited from land disposal on August 8,1990. Injected corrosive waste with a pH of 9 or above would not be prohibiteduntil May 8, 1992 (the effective date of the corrosivity characteristicBDAT standard for injected wastes) because there is no California listprohibition on this waste. Surface-disposed waste with a pH of 6 or lessand 9 or above would be prohibited from land disposal on May 8, 1990 becausethe more specific standards for corrosive wastes apply. The legal basis for EPA's existing approach is that without it, in thecase of a waste which received a national capacity variance under the Californialist rule, EPA would effectively grant a national capacity variance fora California list wastes for longer than two years. For instance, in theexample involving corrosive acids given above, the injected corrosive wasteswould receive a national capacity variance for three years and nine monthsfrom the otherwise applicable California list statutory prohibition. Thisresult may be inconsistent with the express language of section 3004(h)(2).In situations where a California list prohibition has already taken effectbut EPA promulgates a later treatment standard with a national capacityvariance that overlaps the California list waste, it makes little sensefor the California list prohibition (with which people are already complying)to be nullified by a later treatment standard until the treatment standardactually takes effect. See 53 FR at 31188. The Agency repeats that in suchcases, some interim prohibition is better than none at all, and that theexpress role of the California list prohibitions is to serve as an interimprohibition level or standard. See S. Rep. No. 284, 98th Cong. 2d Sess.17. The Agency believes, however, that it is a permissible reading of RCRAthat Congress gave the Agency independent authority to reevaluate nationalcapacity for corrosive waste with a pH of less than 2 when setting standardsfor such wastes, since the Agency has authority to make such determinationsfor corrosive wastes. If the Agency reads the California list prohibitionas controlling for this specific group of wastes, it effectively deprivesitself of its section 3004(g)(4) authority to make capacity determinationsfor corrosive acids in the Third Third rule. Thus, EPA specifically solicitscomments on the legal and policy issues as they may relate to Californialist wastes with a pH of less than 2. EPA's approach may not be fully clear from a simple reading of the languagecurrently codified at 40 CFR 268.32(h) for HOC wastes. Under that provision,the California list prohibitions for HOC-containing wastes specified in40 CFR 268.32(a) (3) and (e) do not apply where the waste is subject toa more waste-specific prohibition and effective date. The Agency notes,however, that none of the several examples in the preamble to the Californialist rule at 52 FR 25760, 25773, 25775, and 25776 (July 8, 1987) addressedthe situation where there is a subsequent waste-specific standard whichalso has a capacity variance. Indeed, one of the functions of the ruleat 40 CFR 268.32(h) was ``to avoid situations where the Agency would begranting a national capacity variance for a period longer than two years.''<T3>Id. at 25773. Moreover, EPA's clarification in the First Third rulewas clear and unchallenged. </T3>Accordingly, EPA is proposing to modify the language of 268.32(h) explicitlyto preclude any periods of time where neither California list nor supersedingHOC standards would operate.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Application of California List Prohibitions to Newly Identifiedor Listed Wastes</ITAG>EPA also solicits comment on whether the California list prohibitions applyto newly identified and listed hazardous wastes. The California list statutoryprohibitions, on the one hand, can be read as applying to all hazardouswastes, regardless of when they become identified or listed. In addition,Congress viewed these prohibition levels as a first step in the prohibitionprocess, and so the California list prohibitions and treatment standardsmight be viewed as appropriate to fill the gap until the Agency developsmore specific treatment standards for the newly identified or listed wastes.On the other hand, the statute contemplates that the Agency will have sixmonths to develop treatment standards for newly identified and listed wastes,and that there will be no statutory hammer if the Agency fails to establishsuch treatment standards. (RCRA section 3004(g)). Given this scheme, itdoes not appear that Congress necessarily contemplated that these wastesbe subject to an immediate California list prohibition. Furthermore, thefact that the California list provision contains a 1987 hard hammer suggeststhat the provision only was meant to apply to wastes hazardous at thattime, rather than to wastes not yet identified or listed.It thus appears to the Agency that it has a choice as to whether Californialist prohibitions apply to newly identified or listed wastes. Policy reasonssupporting the reading that the prohibitions apply would be the earlierimplementation of either treatment standards or interim controls on certaintypes of land disposal (such as treatment in minimum technology surfaceimpoundments). On the other hand, the Agency is concerned that there notbe massive dislocations in the regulated community due to legitimate expectationsthat land disposal prohibitions for newly identified or listed wastes nottake effect until EPA had taken some action specifically directed towardthose wastes, normally a waste-specific rulemaking establishing treatmentstandards.If EPA determines that California list prohibitions do apply to newly identifiedor listed wastes, the Agency anticipates the necessity of granting a two-yearnational capacity variance for certain wastes (<T3>e.g.,</T3> sludge-solids contaminated with HOCs) exhibiting the revisedtoxicity characteristic that are newly subject to subtitle C.In addition, if EPA issues a national capacity variance, the Agency wouldhave to reconcile the four-year impoundment retrofit provision in RCRAsection 3005(j)(6) with the requirement in section 3004(h) that nationalcapacity variance wastes be placed in minimum technology surface impoundmentunits. It appears to the Agency, at least at this time, that the two provisionsare in conflict. EPA therefore has discretion to craft a reading that bestfurthers statutory goals. <T3>Citizens to Save Spencer County</T3> v. <T3>EPA, </T3>600 F. 2d. 844 (D.C. Cir. 1979). EPA's proposed resolutionwould be to allow impoundments up to four years to retrofit, but to requirethe wastes to use available treatment capacity if it becomes availablesooner (<T3>i.e.,</T3> if no case-by-case variance were to be granted after thetwo-year national capacity variance is over).On the other hand, if the Agency ultimately determines that Californialist prohibitions do not apply to newly identified or listed wastes, thenthe Agency would delete the existing requirement that California list HOCsbe treated in either boilers, furnaces, or incinerators (see 53 FR 31138-31222,August 17, 1988), and instead limit the treatment method to burning inincinerators. EPA amended the treatment standard for HOCs to include boilersand furnaces in significant part to assure available treatment capacityfor HOCs and to allow a prohibition to take effect at an earlier date (U.S.EPA, ``Comment Response Background Document for the First Third ProposedLand Disposal Restrictions, Volume I,'' August 8, 1988, page 12-4). Oncethe Third Third rule is promulgated, and assuming that California listprohibitions do not apply to newly identified and listed wastes, thereare virtually no wastes (and possibly none at all) to which the HOC standardwould apply. Therefore, it is not necessary that there be additional combustioncapacity in the form of boilers and furnaces for these wastes, and EPAcan determine on a more particularized basis whether fuel substitutionshould be a basis for BDAT. EPA therefore solicits comment on whether itshould delete the August 17, 1988 rule amending the treatment standardfor HOCs to include burning in boilers and industrial furnaces should itdetermine that California list prohibitions do not apply to newly identifiedand listed hazardous waste.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. State Authority</ITAG>A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized StatesUnder section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administerand enforce the RCRA program within the State. Following authorization,EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 ofRCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility.The standards and requirements for authorization are found in 40 CFR part271.Prior to HSWA, a State with final authorization administered its hazardouswaste program in lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in thatState. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized State,and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities that the State was authorizedto permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgatedor enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority withinspecified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect inan authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.In contrast, under RCRA section 3006(g) (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)), new requirementsand prohibitions imposed by HSWA take effect in authorized States at thesame time that they take effect in nonauthorized States. EPA is directedto carry out these requirements and prohibitions in authorized States,including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorizationto do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as Statelaw to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States inthe interim.With one exception, today's rule is proposed pursuant to sections 3004(d)through (k), and (m), of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6924(d) through (k), and (m)).Therefore, it will be added to Table l in 40 CFR 271.1(j), which identifiesthe Federal program requirements that are promulgated pursuant to HSWAand take effect in all States, regardless of their authorization status.States may apply for either interim or final authorization for the HSWAprovisions in Table l, as discussed in the following section. When thisrule is promulgated, Table 2 in 40 CFR 271.1(j) will be modified also toindicate that this rule is a self-implementing provision of HSWA.The exception is the proposed clarifying amendments to andSection;andSection;261.33 (c) and (d). These clarifications are not effective in authorizedStates since the requirements are not imposed pursuant to HSWA. Thus, theserequirements will be applicable only in those States that do not interimor final authorization. In authorized States, the requirements will notbe applicable until the State revises its program to adopt equivalent requirementsunder State law.B. Effect on State AuthorizationsAs noted above, EPA will implement today's proposal in authorized Statesuntil their programs are modified to adopt these rules and the modificationis approved by EPA. Because the rule is proposed pursuant to HSWA, a Statesubmitting a program modification may apply to receive either interim orfinal authorization under RCRA section 3006(g)(2) or 3006(b), respectively,on the basis of requirements that are substantially equivalent or equivalentto EPA's. The procedures and schedule for State program modifications foreither interim or final authorization are described in 40 CFR 271.21. Itshould be noted that HSWA interim authorization will expire on January1, 1993 (see 40 CFR 271.24(c)).Section 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final authorizationmust modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and mustsubsequently submit the modification to EPA for approval. The deadlineby which the State must modify its program to adopt this proposed regulationwill be determined by the promulgation of the final rule in accordancewith andSection; 271.21(e). These deadlines can be extended in certain cases(see andSection; 271.21(e)(3)). Once EPA approves the modification, the Staterequirements become Subtitle C RCRA requirements.States with authorized RCRA programs may already have requirements similarto those in today's proposal. These State regulations have not been assessedagainst the Federal regulations being proposed today to etermine whetherthey meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not authorizedto implement these requirements in lieu of EPA until the State programmodification is approved. Of course, States with existing standards maycontinue to administer and enforce their standards as a matter of Statelaw. In implementing the Federal program, EPA will work with States underagreements to minimize duplication of efforts. In many cases, EPA willbe able to defer to the States in their efforts to implement their programsrather than take separate actions under Federal authority.States that submit official applications for final authorization less than12 months after the effective date of these regulations are not requiredto include standards equivalent to these regulations in their application.However, the State must modify its program by the deadline set forth inandSection; 271.21(e). States that submit official applications for finalauthorization 12 months after the effective date of these regulations mustinclude standards equivalent to these regulations in their application.The requirements a state must meet when submitting its final authorizationapplication are set forth in 40 CFR 271.3.The regulations being proposed today need not affect the State's UndergroundInjection Control (UIC) primacy status. A State currently authorized toadminister the UIC program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) couldcontinue to do so without seeking authority to administer these amendments.However, a State which wished to implement part 148 and receive authorizationto grant exemptions from the land disposal restrictions would have to demonstratethat it had the requisite authority to administer sections 3004(f) and(g) of RCRA. The conditions under which such an authorization may takeplace are summarized below and are discussed in a July 15, 1985 final rule(50 FR 28728).C. State ImplementationThe following four aspects of the framework established in the November7, 1986, rule (51 FR 40572) affect State implementation of today's proposaland impact State actions on the regulated community:1. Under part 268, subpart C, EPA is proposing land disposal restrictionsfor all generators, treaters, storers, and disposers of certain types ofhazardous waste. In order to retain authorization, States must adopt theregulations under this Subpart since State requirements can be no lessstringent than Federal requirements.2. Also under part 268, EPA is proposing to grant two-year national variancesfrom the effective dates of the land disposal restrictions based on ananalysis of available alternative treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity.Under andSection; 268.5, case-by-case extensions of up to one year (renewablefor one additional year) may be granted for specific applicants lackingadequate capacity.The Administrator of EPA is solely responsible for granting variances tothe effective dates because these determinations must be made on a nationalbasis. In addition, it is clear that RCRA section 3004(h)(3) intends forthe Administrator to grant case-by case extensions after consulting theaffected States, on the basis of national concerns which only the Administratorcan evaluate. Therefore, States cannot be authorized for this aspect ofthe program.3. Under andSection; 268.44, the Agency may grant waste-specific variancesfrom treatment standards in cases where it can be demonstrated that thephysical and/or chemical properties of the wastes differ significantlyfrom wastes analyzed in developing the treatment standards, and the wastescannot be treated to specified levels or treated by specified methods.The Agency is solely responsible for granting such variances since theresult of such an action may be the establishment of a new waste treatabilitygroup. All wastes meeting the criteria of these new waste treatabilitygroups may also be subject to the treatment standard established by thevariance. Granting such variances may have national impacts; therefore,this aspect of the program is not delegated to the States at this time.4. Under andSection; 268.6, EPA may grant petitions of specific durationto allow land disposal of certain hazardous wastes where it can be demonstratedthat there will be no migration of hazardous constituents for as long asthe waste remains hazardous. States which have the authority to imposerestrictions may be authorized under RCRA section 3006 to grant petitionsfor exemptions from the restrictions. Decisions on site-specific petitionsdo not require the national perspective required to restrict wastes orgrant extensions. EPA will be handling ``no migration'' petitions at Headquarters,though the States may be authorized to grant these petitions in the future.The Agency expects to gain valuable experience and information from reviewof ``no migration'' petitions which may affect future land disposal restrictionsrulemakings. In accordance with RCRA section 3004(i), EPA will publishnotice of the Agency's final decision on petitions in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="85">V. Effect of the Land Disposal Restrictions Program on Other EnvironmentalPrograms </ITAG>A. Discharges Regulated Under the Clean Water Act As a result of the land disposal restrictions program, some generatorsmight switch from land disposal of restricted Third Third wastes to dischargeto publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs) in order to avoid incurring thecosts of alternative treatment. In shifting from land disposal to dischargeto POTWs, an increase in human and environmental risks could occur. Alsoas a result of the land disposal restrictions, hazardous waste generatorsmight illegally discharge their wastes to surface waters without treatment,which could cause damage to the local ecosystem and potentially pose healthrisks from direct exposure or bioaccumulation. Some generators might treat their wastes prior to discharging to a POTW,but the treatment step itself could increase risks to the environment.For example, if incineration were the pretreatment step, metals and otherhazardous constituents present in air scrubber waters could be dischargedto surface waters. However, the amount of Third Third waste shifted toPOTWs would be limited by such factors as the physical form of the waste,the degree of pretreatment required prior to discharge, and State and localregulations. B. Discharges Regulated Under the Marine Protection, Research, and SanctuariesAct There could be a potential demand for some of the hazardous wastes includedin today's proposed rulemaking to be shifted from land disposal to oceandumping and ocean-based incineration. If the cost of ocean-based disposalplus transportation were lower than the cost of land-based treatment, disposal,and transportation, this option could seem to be an attractive alternative.In addition, ocean-based disposal could seem attractive to the regulatedcommunity if land-based treatment were not available. However, the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 has restricted ocean dumpingof sewage sludge and industrial wastes to existing, authorized dumpersuntil December 31, 1991, after which `` * * * it shall be unlawful forany person to dump (sewage sludge or industrial wastes) into ocean waters* * * ''. Therefore, the Ocean Dumping Ban Act has made moot any economicor other incentive to ocean dump industrial hazardous wastes, includingthe wastes subject to this regulation. C. Wellhead Protection Regulated Under the Safe Drinking Water Act Section 1428 of the SDWA contains requirements for the development andimplementation of state Wellhead Protection (WHP) Programs to protect wellsand wellfields which are used, or may be used to provide drinking waterto public water systems. Under section 1428, each state must adopt andsubmit to EPA for approval a WHP program that, at a minimum: (1) Specifies the duties of state agencies, local governments, and publicwater systems in the development and implementation of the WHP program;(2) For each wellhead, determines the wellhead protection area (WHPA),as defined in section 1428(e) of SDWA, based on all reasonably availablehydrogeologic information on ground-water flow, recharge, and dischargeand other information the state deems necessary to adequately determinethe WHPA; (3) Identifies within each WHPA all potential human sources of contaminantswhich may have any adverse health effects; (4) Describes provisions for technical assistance, financial assistance,implementation of control measures, and education, training, and demonstrationprojects to protect the water supply within WHPAs from such contaminants;(5) Includes contingency plans for the location and provision of alternatedrinking water supplies for each public water system in the event of wellor wellfield contamination by such contaminants; (6) Requires that state and local governments and public water systemsconsider all potential sources of human contamination within the expectedwellhead area of a new water well which serves a public water system; and(7) Requires public participation in developing the WHP program. SDWA required all states to submit a WHP program to EPA by June 19, 1989,for EPA review and approval. EPA has received 29 state submittals for review.SDWA requires that all Federal agencies having jurisdiction over any potentialsource of contaminants identified by a state program under this sectionshall comply with all the requirements of the state program. Any private or public entity subject to the land disposal restrictionsregulations must also be in compliance with the appropriate state's wellheadprotection program. The Agency reiterates that the land disposal of hazardouswastes must comply not only with the land disposal restrictions and otherRCRA regulations, but with other environmental programs, such as the WellheadProtection Program under the Safe Drinking Water Act. D. Air Emissions Regulated Under the Clean Air Act (CAA) There are two air emission concerns with respect to the land disposal restrictions.The first is a cross-media concern about air emissions that occur as aresult of waste treatment such as incineration of metal-bearing wastescausing metal emissions to the atmosphere. Another concern is with airemissions from the land disposal of the treatment residue. Air emissioncontrol programs are under development using both the CAA and RCRA to addressthese concerns as discussed below. Specific cross-media air emission concerns have been identified for treatmenttechnologies applicable to Third Third wastes, but EPA believes that existingClean Air Act controls adequately address the potential problems. Retortingof mercury sulfide wastes can result in air emissions of both elementalmercury and sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>). The Agency has promulgated a National Emission Standard forHazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for mercury emissions under section 112of the CAA (40 CFR part 61, subpart E). There are no industry-specificnational CAA control standards for SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from retorting mercury sulfide wastes. There are,however, regulations for the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD)of air quality that would address not only these SO<T2>2</T2> emissions but also any mercury emissions that are not regulatedby the NESHAP. The NESHAP limits mercury emissions to the atmosphere from mercury processingfacilities, mercury cell chlor-alkali plants, and plants that incinerateand/or dry wastewater treatment plant sludges. In all these cases, theNESHAP limits mercury emissions across the entire processing facility tothe extent necessary to protect human health. The NESHAP would not applyto a dedicated mercury sulfide waste retorting facility that is not locatedin an ore processing or a mercury cell chlor-alkali plant. Under section 165(a) of the CAA, all new major stationary sources and majormodifications to existing sources of air pollution must obtain a PSD permit.If the mercury or SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from the retorting process were to come from a majorstationary source or a major modification subject to the PSD regulationsand would be emitted in significant amounts (greater than 0.1 tons peryear of mercury or 40 tons per year of SO<T2>2</T2>), then such emissions would be subject to best available controltechnology (BACT) requirements. An air quality analysis for mercury andSO<T2>2</T2> would also be required under PSD. Moreover, an air quality analysismust be conducted to demonstrate that the SO<T2>2</T2> emissions would neither cause nor contribute to violations ofany national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) or PSD increment forSO<T2>2</T2>. Facilities that are located in areas that have failed to meetany NAAQS for SO<T2>2</T2> (i.e., designated nonattachment areas) and emit more than 100tons per year of SO<T2>2</T2>, must not only apply emission controls that meet the lowestachievable emission rate but also offset their remaining SO<T2>2</T2> emissions by acquiring federally enforceable emission reductionsfrom other nearby SO<T2>2</T2> emissions sources.The Agency is also concerned whether incineration of wastes containingbrominated organics or organo-nitrogen compounds may adversely affect airquality. The presence of bromine complicates the evaluation of incinerationof these wastes. A detailed discussion of the Agency's approach for brominatedorganics is contained in section III.A.2.e of today's preamble. A discussionof potential nitrogen oxide emissions from organo-nitrogen wastes is containedin section III.A.3.f. There are several general regulatory development programs under RCRA thataddress treatment technology air emissions. The Agency has initiated athree-phased program under section 3004(n) of RCRA to address air emissionsfrom hazardous waste management units other than incinerators. The firstphase addresses organic air emissions as a class from two types of emissionsources. The first source category is process equipment (pumps, valves,etc.) that contact hazardous waste that contain greater than 10 percentorganic compounds, including such as distillation units and incinerators.The second source category is certain vents on various treatment technologies,such as air or steam strippers. These standards were proposed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 5, 1987 (52 FR 3748) and are scheduledto be promulgated in fall of 1989. The second phase of standards development under section 3004(n) of RCRAaddresses organic air emissions as a class from tanks, containers, andsurface impoundments. Treatment technologies that occur in tanks or containersthat are not controlled by the Phase I standards would be controlled bythese standards. Wastes that would be prohibited from land disposal maycontinue to be managed in a surface impoundment as long as the treatmentresiduals that do not meet the applicable treatment standards are removedfrom the impoundment within one year of entry into the impoundment. Thesestandards will control air emissions from the management of wastes in thesurface impoundment. These standards are scheduled to be proposed in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> in fall of 1989. In the third phase of the section 3004(n) standards development, the Agencywill develop additional standards for the sources addressed in the firsttwo phases as necessary to address residual risks. In addition to the section 3004(n) standards, general standards to controlboth organic and metal emissions from the combustion of hazardous wastein incinerators and other types of combustion devices are under variousstages of development. In certain cases, waste treatment may occur in treatment technologies thatare not required to obtain RCRA permits. Guidance for the control of airemissions from these sources, such as exempt biological treatment tanksand recycling units, is being developed under the CAA. None of the regulatory efforts discussed above address air emissions fromthe land disposal of treatment residue in landfills, land treatment units,or waste piles because the Agency presently presumes that these units willonly receive wastes that have been treated to meet the BDAT requirementsand that this level of treatment comments on this presumption. In a separaterulemaking, the Agency is considering to propose regulations limiting airemissions from land disposal units seeking to land dispose of wastes undera no migration variance. E. Clean Up Actions Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act The land disposal restrictions may have significant effects on the selectionand implementation of response actions that are taken under the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Thereare three primary areas in which these effects may occur. One area that may be affected by the land disposal restrictions is in theselection of treatment standards at the remedial action site. The cleanupstandards set at CERCLA sites are risk-based, while treatment standardsdeveloped under the land disposal restrictions program are technology-based.Therefore, the technology-based treatment standards may be more stringentthan the risk-based cleanup standards developed based on the CERCLA selectionof remedy criteria, and vice versa. Another matter that may be affectedis the treatment of soil and debris contaminated with wastes restrictedfrom land disposal. Contaminated soil and debris are a primary type ofwaste that must be remediated at most CERCLA sites. In many cases, thesoil matrix is different from that of the industrial wastes for which treatmentstandards are set. CERCLA site managers must either comply with the treatmentstandards or request and be granted a variance from the treatment standard(andSection; 268.44) or request and be granted a ``no-migration'' variance(andSection; 268.6). Finally, even though the hazardous substances at a CERCLA remediation sitemay have been disposed prior to the effective date of RCRA, if the actioninvolves removal of restricted wastes after the prohibition effective date,the land disposal restrictions are legally applicable (51 FR 40577, November7, 1986). See also <T3>Chemical Waste Management </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>869 F.2d at 1535-37 (D.C. Cir. 1989). For example, if a wasteis excavated from a unit, treated, and redisposed, EPA has indicated that``placement'' (see RCRA section 3004(k)) of the waste in a land disposalunit has occurred, and the applicable treatment standards must be met (see53 FR 51444 and 51445, December 21, 1988). However, if the waste is cappedin place, removal or ``placement'' has not occurred, and the treatmentstandards are not legally applicable. F. Applicability of Treatment Standards to Wastes From Pesticides RegulatedUnder the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act A number of generators of pesticide waste that have heretofore been comparativelyunaware of the land disposal restrictions may be regulated when today'sproposed rulemaking is promulgated. This will require that the Agency developguidance materials and provide training on how to comply with the requirementsof the land disposal restrictions. Generators of significant quantities of pesticide P and U wastes are farmersand commercial pesticide applicators. The provisions of 40 CFR 262.70 and268.1 exempt farmers from regulation under the land disposal restrictionsprogram; however, no such exemption exists for commercial applicators.Such generators of hazardous wastes have traditionally land disposed theirpesticide wastes. Subsequent to promulgation of today's proposed rule,these generators must comply with the requirements of the land disposalrestrictions if they dispose a restricted hazardous waste. G. Regulatory Overlap of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Under the ToxicSubstance Control Act (TSCA) and RCRA Certain P and U listed wastes contain PCBs. The PCB component of such awaste mixture is regulated primarily under TSCA (although it may also bea California list waste, and subject to RCRA regulation (both substantiveand administrative as well)), while the listed P or U component of thewaste is regulated under RCRA. Such a mixture of listed/PCB waste mustmeet the applicable requirements under both statutes. Such a waste mustgo to an incinerator permitted under both TSCA and RCRA. Any ash residualfrom incineration must meet the treatment standard for the listed wastecomponent prior to land disposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Requirements</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact Analysis_Surface Disposed WastesIn accordance with Executive Order No. 12291, the Agency has reviewed thecosts and benefits of today's rule and has determined that today's ruleconstitutes a ``major regulation'' because it is likely to result in anannual cost to the economy in excess of $100 million. As a result of thisdetermination, the Agency has conducted a regulatory impact analysis (RIA)in support of today's rule. The complete RIA document, ``Regulatory ImpactAnalysis of the Land Disposal Restrictions for Third Third Scheduled WastesProposed Rule (Draft),'' is available for review in the public docket fortoday's rule. The complete document was also submitted to the Office ofManagement and Budget for review, as required by Executive Order No. 12291.This section of the preamble summarizes the results of the regulatory impactanalysis of the proposed rule, as detailed in the draft RIA document. SectionVI.A.1 below describes the universe of wastes and facilities affected bytoday's rule. Section VI.A.2 below summarizes the analysis of human healthand environmental benefits attributable to today's rule. Section VI.A.3summarizes the economic cost and impact analysis performed for today'srule.It is important to note that the summary analysis presented in this sectionof the preamble and in the draft RIA document does not completely reflectthe current status of the proposed rule or the regulated community. Forexample, when the RIA was begun, the latest data available to describethe universe of facilities managing Third Third wastes was EPA's 1986 ``NationalSurvey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Facilities.''Between the time of data collection for this survey and today, there havebeen changes at particular facilities regarding waste practices and volumes.The most dramatic change has been with surface impoundments that have subsequentlybeen closed or no longer receive hazardous wastes. The Agency has updatedthe data base to reflect these changes wherever possible, but some differencesmay still exist. Because the data were revised, the Agency believes thatthis source of discrepancy is small.As another example, proposed treatment standards had not been establishedfor all affected wastes when the RIA began. Thus, in order to completethe regulatory analysis in time to accompany the proposed rule, the Agencyhad to make certain assumptions as to what would be selected for proposedtreatment standards. Consequently, the standards modelled in the regulatoryimpact analysis and the standards actually proposed were not identicalfor 17 of the more than 300 waste codes addressed in the proposed rule.The differences are not expected to have a significant effect on the costestimates because the technologies assumed for these 17 waste codes weresimilar in cost to that actually proposed. These and other discrepancieswill be addressed in the regulatory impact analysis of the Third Thirdfinal rule.The Agency analyzed benefits, costs and economic impacts using the sameapproach and methodology that was used for the August 17, 1988, First Thirdfinal rule (53 FR 31138).\1\<NOTE/> The effects of the proposed rule were estimated by comparingpost-regulatory management practices and conditions with those occurringunder baseline conditions. The baseline was defined as continued land disposalof wastes in units meeting minimum technological requirements. The baselinefor future years was not adjusted to reflect hard hammer provisions thatwould prohibit land disposal in the absence of the proposed rule afterMay 8, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ For detailed information on the cost methodology, see<T3>Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Land Disposal Restrictions on FirstThird Wastes: Final Report,</T3> August 1988, ICF Incorporated.The Agency did adjust reported waste management practices to reflect compliancewith the provision of promulgated land disposal restriction rules coveringsolvents and dioxins, California list wastes, and First and Second Thirdscheduled wastes. In making these adjustments, EPA assumed that facilitieswould comply with these other rules by the least costly methods allowable.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Overview of Affected Wastes, Facilities, and Management</ITAG>The universe of waste and facilities examined for the RIA was developedfrom EPA's 1986 ``National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage,Disposal, and Recycling Facilities'' (hereafter, the TSDR Survey) and EPA's1984 ``National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generators and Treatment, Storage,and Disposal Facilities Regulated under RCRA in 1981'' (hereafter, theRIA Mail survey). Data regarding waste management in surface impoundmentsin the TSDR Survey has been adjusted to reflect changes in industry practicessince 1986. Most treatment and storage surface impoundments in the TSDRSurvey have been closed or have been exempted from hazardous waste managementregulations.As with past land disposal restrictions RIAs, the TSDR and RIA Mail surveysprovide an overview of the number of facilities treating, storing, or disposingof waste; the quantities and types (by RCRA waste code) of waste managedat each facility; and the current practice or method of treatment. Theadjusted information contained in the two surveys is accepted as the baseline(i.e., pre-Third Third rule) practice for this RIA.<T3>Quantity of Affected Waste.</T3> Today's rule will potentially affectapproximately 379 million gallons of waste per year as shown in FigureVI-1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,4</C><T4>Table </T4>VI-1._<T4>Third Third Rule Quantity by Waste Type</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[In million gallons per year] </ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Vol.</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Ignitable (D001), Corrosive (D002), and Reactive Wastes (D003)<D>36</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">EP Toxic Wastes (D004-D017)<D>141</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Listed Wastes<D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mixtures of Wastes<D>135</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">CBI Wastes<D>64</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>379</D></ITAG></ITAG>Characteristic wastes constitute the largest volume of wastes covered bythe proposed rule. In addition to the 47 percent identified as D001-D017,the waste mixtures category is dominated by characteristic wastes. Forinstance, two mixtures of characteristic wastes (D002/D007/D009 and D002/D006/D008)alone account for 110 million gallons, more than 80 percent of the wastemixtures volume.

A further examination of the TSDR survey data revealsthe following information about the range of industries with large volumesof Third Third wastes.The volume of noncommercial process waste, which accounts for 39.6 percentof the total waste volume, is distributed across the following StandardIndustrial Code (SIC) groups:andbullet; SIC 28, Chemical and Allied Products (71%)andbullet; SIC 33, Primary Metals Industries (11%)andbullet; SIC 49, Electric, Gas, and Sanitary Services (8%)andbullet; SIC 29, Petroleum Refining and Related Industry (4%)andbullet; CBI (4%)andbullet; other industry groups (2%).The volume of commercial process waste, which accounts for 60.4 percentof the total waste volume, is distributed across the following SIC groups:andbullet; SIC 49, Electric, Gas, and Sanitary Services (39%)andbullet; CBI (26%)andbullet; SIC 99, Nonclassifiable Establishments (8%)andbullet; SIC 89, Services, not classified (8%)andbullet; SIC 28, Chemicals and Allied Products (6%)andbullet; SIC 33, Primary Metals Industries (5%)andbullet; other industry groups (8%).<T3>Waste Management Practices. </T3>Based on the TSDR survey, the RIAexamined five land disposal baseline management practices: disposal inlandfills, disposal by land treatment, disposal in surface impoundments,treatment in waste piles, and storage in waste piles. Table VI-4 providesa breakdown of these baseline management practices by volume and numberof facilities. As shown on the table, almost two thirds of the waste volumecovered by the proposed rule is currently managed in landfills or disposalsurface impoundments. Landfills are also the most prevalent baseline practice,occurring at over 35 percent of the affected facilities. About 30 percentof the wastes are managed in disposal surface impoundments.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,9,8</C><T4>Table VI-4._Third Third Rule Baseline Management Practices</T4><H1>Baseline Practice </H1><H1>VoI.(MG) </H1><H1>Facilities</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Landfill<D>134.0</D><D>35.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Land treatment<D>5.0</D><D>21.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Storage waste piles <D>35.0</D><D>22.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Treatment waste piles <D>27.0</D><D>14.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Disposal surface impoundments114<D>7.1</D><D>12.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Confidential business information <D>64.0</D><D>18.0</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>379.0</D><D>111.0</D></ITAG></ITAG>Treatment practices in compliance with today's rule significantly redistributethe quantities of waste among management practices. Most important, while379 million gallons of waste per year are land disposed under baselinemanagement practices, 209 million gallons of waste per year would be disposedof in landfills after treatment as a result of today's rule. Thus, theproposed rule would result in a 45 percent reduction in the volume of ThirdThird wastes being land disposed. Most of the wastes covered by the proposedrule would be treated by precipitation or stabilization.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Benefits of the Proposed Rule</ITAG>The proposed rule would result in several benefits including reduced humanhealth risks, improved safety at facilities, and reduced ecological effects.As with previous land disposal restrictions, the Agency quantified thehuman health benefits and conducted a qualitative analysis of the otherbenefits.<T3>Human-Health Benefits. </T3>The quantitative benefits analysis estimatedthat over a 70 year lifetime, the proposed rule would reduce cancer casesby 148 and reduce the number of people exposed to at least one noncarcinogensabove health based criteria by about 34,700.Approximately 85% of cancer cases averted are due to reduced exposure tobenzene, acrylonitrile, dichloromethane and other carcinogenic constituentsin D001 ignitable wastes and arsenic in D004. Treatment of these wastesaccount for about 10% of the costs of the rule. About 99% of noncarcinogenicbenefits are due to reduced exposure to D001 ignitable wastes, cadmium(D006) and chromium (D007) as well as mixtures with these metals or nickel,mercury or barium. Treatment of these wastes account for about 44% of thecost of the rule.The Agency notes that these estimates are uncertain and may overstate orunderestimate the human-health benefits of the proposed rule. The RCRARisk-Cost Analysis model does not contain enough data to model about 90of the more than 250 constituents found in the Third Third wastes. As aresult, benefits of regulating wastes with one or more of these missingconstituents may be underestimated. At the same time, benefits may be overestimateddue to conservative exposure assumptions. Exposure scenarios are basedon drinking 2 litres/day for seventy years of contaminated water or inhaIationof 20 cubic meters/day of air for seventy years.<T3>Safety Benefits.</T3> In addition to adverse human-health effects,ignitable (D001) and reactive (D003) wastes may pose a general safety hazard.Land disposal of these wastes are currently only allowed if the waste iseither deactivated or precautions are taken to prevent accidental ignitionor reaction. Approximately 22 million gallons of D001 and D003 are currentlybeing land disposed without deactivation. Until they are deactivated, thereis some on-going risk that the safety precautions may fail, resulting infires, explosions, or release of toxic gases. The proposed rule would requiredeactivation, thereby terminating the safety risk.<T3>Environmental Benefits. </T3>The proposed rule would result in an overallreduction in toxic releases to the environment, thereby reducing adverseeffects to ecosystems. The resulting improvement in ecological health isextremely difficult to quantify due to uncertainty in estimating exposurelevels and species populations. However, the sensitivity of certain speciesto hazardous constituents of wastes covered by the proposed rule suggesta very high potential for ecological effects. As an example, aquatic species are at least two orders of magnitude moresensitive than humans to arsenic (D004), mercury (D009), silver (D011),lindane (D013), methoxychlor (D014), and toxaphene (D015). Therefore, tothe extent that these wastes are released to waterbodies, aquatic ecosystemsmay be at some risk even when there is no human health risk. Another way to look at the potential for ecological effects is to considerthe proximity of land disposal facilities to waterbodies. A recent Agencystudy on ecological risks showed that for a sample of 52 National PrioritiesList sites, almost 90 percent of the sites posed a threat to freshwaterecosystems due to their proximity to waterbodies. \2\<NOTE/> Wastes removed from some of these sites may be subject tothe treatment standards proposed in  this rule. Thus, the proposed rulewould reduce ecological risk associated with any Third Third wastes managedat these sites. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>Summary of Ecological Risks, Assessment Methods, and Risk ManagementDecision in Superfund and RCRA </T3>(EPA-230-03-89-046) June 1989. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Costs </ITAG>The proposed rule would result in an annual incremental costs of approximately$259 million, and would affect over 1400 facilities in 17 industrial sectors.Table VI-5 summarizes the estimated incremental costs associated with today'srule by waste type. As expected based on volumes, the largest incremental cost is attributedto the management of characteristic wastes. Although the listed wastesare a small volume and have the lowest total cost, expensive treatmenttechnologies such as incineration result in a much higher cost per volumetreated. Conversely, the corrosive wastes and mixtures with corrosive wastesare very inexpensive to neutralize, resulting in a very low cost per volumetreated.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,b2,i1,s10,5,5,7</C><T4>Table </T4>VI-6._<T4>Third Third Rule Volumes and Incremental Cost by Waste Type </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[in million gallons and million dollars per year] </ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Volume</H1><H1>Incremental</H1><H2>Cost </H2><H2>$/Vol.</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Ignitable (D001), corrosive (D002), and reactive wastes (D003) <D>36 </D><D>$30.8 </D><D>$0.86 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">EP toxic wastes (D004-D017) <D>141 </D><D>110.5 </D><D>0.78 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Listed wastes <D>3 </D><D>18.4 </D><D>6.13 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mixtures of wastes <D>135 </D><D>33.7 </D><D>0.25 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">CBI wastes <D>64 </D><D>65.5 </D><D>1.02</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>379 </D><D>258.9 </D><D>0.68</D></ITAG></ITAG>  Five characteristic wastes contribute over 40 percent of the incrementalcost of the rule as shown in Table VI-7. EP Toxic wastes for chromium (D007)and lead (D008) are the two single wastes that would incur the most incrementalcost, primarily due to their volumes. By volume, D007 and D008 are thetwo largest individual wastes addressed by the proposed rule. D007 wastesare generally treated by chromium reduction in combination with other treatmentsteps depending on their characteristics. Similarly, D008 wastes would be treated by several different techniques,primarily involving precipitation and stabilization. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s20,9,9 </C><T4>Table </T4>VI-7._<T4>Wastes Incurring the Most Incremental Cost </T4><H1> </H1><H1>Cost ($Mill./yr) </H1><H1>% of total incr. cost</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">CBI Wastes <D>66 </D><D>25 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D007, EP toxic for chromium <D>36 </D><D>14 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D008, EP toxic for lead <D>36 </D><D>14 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D004, EP toxic for arsenic <D>16 </D><D>6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D001, ignitable <D>13 </D><D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">D003, reactive <D>11 </D><D>4</D></ITAG></ITAG>  The cost of treating D002 corrosive wastes attributed to the proposed rulemay be overestimated by as much as $6 million per year because some ofthese wastes may be treated due to the California List Land Disposal Restrictionsrule (52 FR 25760). That rule established a performance standard prohibitingland disposal of wastes with a pH less than 2, while the proposed rulewould establish a technology-based standard of neutralization. The Agencydoes not have data on how facilities are meeting the California List standard.Rather than make assumptions about the post-California List practices,the Agency chose to overestimate costs by attributing the entire cost ofneutralizing D002 acidic wastes to this proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Economic Impacts </ITAG>Table VI-8 summarizes the cost and economic impact of the proposed rule.Compliance costs are the tax-adjusted revenue requirements needed to fundthe incremental costs discussed above. Significantly affected facilitiesare those who either need to increase costs by more than 5 percent or theircompliance costs exceed 5 percent of their cash from operations. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s10,5,5,6,5 </C><T4>Table </T4>VI-8._<T4>Summary of Economic Impact by Type of Facility </T4><H1>Economic impact </H1><H1>Type of facility </H1><H2>Noncommercial </H2><H2>Commercial </H2><H2>Generator </H2><H1>Total</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Compliance cost ($Mill.) <D>29 </D><D>230 </D><D>221 </D><D>* 251 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Affected facilities <D>72 </D><D>39 </D><D>1,389 </D><D>1,461 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Significantly affected <D>8 </D><D>NA </D><D>554 </D><D>562 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Estimated closures <D>2 </D><D>NA </D><D>10 </D><D>12 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Affected industry groups <D>15 </D><D>15 </D><D>17 </D><D>** 23 </D><F>* Total tax-adjusted compliance cost is less than the sum of compliancecost by facility type because there are noncommercial processes at commercialfacilities. </F><F>** Some industry sectors are included under more than one type of facility.Therefore the sum of the three facility types is more than the total.</F></ITAG></ITAG>  The economic analysis estimates that the effects of the proposed rule wouldbe distributed over a wide range of industries rather than concentratedin a few. Facilities in 23 major industrial groups (two-digit SIC) areaffected by the proposed rule. Significantly affected facilities are foundin 8 of these industrial groups. The two groups most affected by the proposedrule are SIC 34 and SIC 28, with 168 and 64 significantly affected generators,respectively.The analysis estimates that 12 facilities would close as a result of theproposed rule. By comparison, the First Third rule was estimated to resultin almost 200 closures.Generators are the type of facility that incurs the largest economic impact.The analysis estimates that 88 percent of the compliance cost will be borneby generators. Also, almost 40 percent of the affected generators willbe significantly affected. Of the 12 potential closures discussed above,10 are generators, which is less than 2 percent of the 554 significantlyaffected generators.The TSDR survey identified only 3 small businesses that currently landdispose Third Third waste. None of the 3 are significantly affected underthe proposed rule.For the Third Thirds Final Rule RIA, the Agency expects the results ofthe 1988 ``National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generators and Treatment,Storage, and Disposal Facilities Regulated under RCRA'' to be availableto support the analysis. Also, a plant-specific analysis for generatorswill be considered if the data are available in time for the analysis.Additional small businesses possibly affected by the rule may be identifiedat that time.B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis_Surface Disposed WastesPursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>whenever an Agency is required to publish a notice ofrulemaking for a proposed rule, it must prepare and make available forpublic comment a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) that describes theeffect of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations,and small governmental jurisdictions). This analysis is unnecessary, however,if the Agency's Administrator certifies that the rule will not have a significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities.EPA evaluated the economic effect of the proposed rule on small entities,here defined as firms employing fewer than 50 persons. Because of datalimitations, the Agency was unable to include generators of large quantitiesof Third Third wastes. The small business population therefore includedonly two groups: all noncommercial TSDFs employing fewer than 50 personsand all small quantity generators (SQGs) that were also small businesses.As a result, the effect of the proposed rule on small businesses is underestimated.However, the Agency would not expect the conclusions of the small businessanalysis to change significantly if the generator data were available.According to EPA's guidelines for conducting an RFA, if over 20 percentof the population of small businesses, small organizations, or small governmentjurisdictions is likely to experience financial distress based on the costsof the rule, then the Agency is required to consider that the rule willhave a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities andto perform a formal RFA. EPA has examined the proposed rule's potentialeffects on small entities as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act.The economic analysis identified only six small businesses potentiallyaffected by the proposed rule. None of these six would be significantlyaffected. The Administrator therefore certifies that Part 268 will nothave significant economic effects on a substantial number of small entities.As a result of this finding, the Agency has not prepared a formal RFA.C. Regulatory Impact Analysis_Underground Injected Wastes The Agency has completed a separate regulatory impact analysis for undergroundinjected wastes affected by today's proposed rule. Sixty-five injection facilities, injecting approximately 6.5 billion gallonsof Third Third wastes annually, will be required to either treat wastesor file ``no migration'' petitions as outlined in 40 CFR 148.20 (See 53<T3>FR </T3>28118). The addition of these facilities will contribute substantiallyto compliance costs already incurred by injection well owners and operatorsmanaging hazardous wastes regulated by previous rulemaking. The Agency analyzed costs and benefits using the same approach and methodologydeveloped in the ``Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Underground InjectionControl Program: Proposed Hazardous Waste Disposal Injection Restrictions''used for the July 26, 1988, final rule (53 FR 28118) and subsequent rulemaking.An analysis was performed to assess the economic effect of associated compliancecosts for the additional volume of injected wastes attributable to today'sproposed rule. Total compliance costs for injected wastes are estimatedat $54 million annually. Alternative treatment costs are estimated at $53.7million annually and petition costs are annualized at $0.3 million. The RIA estimates that 17 facilities will eventually treat their wastes,and therefore be significantly affected economically by today's proposedrule. The benefits outlined in the RIA are generally defined as the reduced humanhealth risk resulting from fewer instances of groundwater contamination.Potential health risks from Class I hazardous waste injection wells arelow, except in a few isolated cases depending on proximity to well location,the geologic setting, unplugged boreholes, and injection well grout sealfailure. D. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis_Underground Injection Wastes The economic analysis identified only six small businesses potentiallyaffected by part 268 of the proposed rule. None of these six would be significantlyaffected. Owners and operators of hazardous waste injection wells are generally majorchemical, petrochemical, and other manufacturing companies. The Agencyis not aware of any small entities of injection wells that would be affectedby part 148 of today's proposed rule. The Administrator therefore certifies that part 148 and part 268 will nothave significant economic effects on a substantial number of small entities.As a result of this finding, the Agency has not prepared a formal RFA.E. Paperwork Reduction Act All information collection requirements in this proposed rule were promulgatedin previous land disposal restrictions rulemakings and approved by theOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) at that time. Since there are nonew information collection requirements being promulgated today, (includingthose for the Underground Injection Control Program) an Information CollectionRequest has not been prepared. F. Review of Supporting Documents The primary source of information on current land disposal practices andindustries affected by this rule was EPA's 1986 ``National Survey of HazardousWaste Treatment, Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Facilities'' (the TSDRSurvey). The average quantity of waste contributed by generator facilitieswas obtained from EPA's ``National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generatorsand Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities Regulated under RCRA in1981'' (April 1984). Waste stream characterization data and engineering costs of waste managementwere based on the following EPA documents: andbullet; ``Characterization of Waste Streams Listed in 40 CFR part 261Waste Profiles,'' Vols. I and II (August 1985); andbullet; ``Characterization of Constituents from Selected Waste StreamsListed in 40 CFR part 261,'' Vols. I and II (August 1985); andbullet; RCRA background and listing documents for 40 CFR part 261; andbullet; RCRA Section 3007 industry studies; andbullet; ``RCRA Risk-Cost Analysis Model, Appendix A: Waste Stream DataBase'' (March 1984); andbullet; Source assessment documents for various industries; and andbullet; ``1986-1987 Survey of Selected Firms in the Commercial HazardousWaste Management Industry: Final Report'' (March 1988). Financial information for the economic impact analysis was obtained fromthe 1982 Census of Manufacturers and 1984 Annual Survey of Manufacturers.Producer price indices were used to restate 1984 dollars in 1987 terms.For the final rule RIA, the Agency will use these producer price indicesto restate 1984 dollars in 1990 terms.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
