Since then, the agency has found traces of thefungicide in 11 of 116 Italian and French shipments,including Beaujolais wines and more Asti Spumante, as part ofits continuing investigation. Sunday, the FDA announced itwould require some Italian and French vintners to certifythat their wines were free of the procymidone.</LP><TEXT>   The FDA doesn't believe the fungicide is a health threatat the levels it has detected. But with consumersincreasingly skittish about pesticides and wine consumptiondropping 2% a year, the industry is worried about publicperception.   &quot;People in the importing business look at this and say ithas the potential to get blown out of proportion,&quot; says anexecutive at a major U.S. vintner. Although the fungicideisn't used by domestic vintners, he says all wine makers havereason to be concerned because the image of wine in generalcould be hurt. &quot;This isn't an imports vs. California winesissue. Something like procymidone affects all wines.&quot;   The procymidone discovery spotlights the problem ofconflicting regulatory standards in different countries forfood additives and pesticides. Some experts question whetherU.S. regulators and marketers are prepared to deal with theissue of imported food that meets standards in its owncountry but that may not meet U.S. regulations.   &quot;We are going see to more of this -- pesticides that areviolative but not really a health hazard,&quot; says RichardJackson, who heads up the risk assessment branch ofCalifornia's department of health services. &quot;This is aclassic example of the world getting smaller at the same timeour labs are getting better.&quot; He adds: &quot;We are going to haveto grapple with the legal issues. Do you condemn a largeamount of food that really presents no health effect?&quot;   In an era when food imports are soaring, the dispute alsofocuses new attention on what critics call the so-called&quot;circle of poison,&quot; pesticides that are banned orunregistered in the U.S. but not overseas and thus wind up onAmerica's dinner table. A pending bill sponsored by Sen.Patrick Leahy would stringently regulate food imports sprayedwith pesticides that are prohibited in the U.S.   When it comes to wines, the problem isn't limited toforeign-made pesticides alone. According to a staffer in Sen.Leahy's office, U.S. chemical companies make some pesticidesfor grapes that aren't registered for use here and that areonly exported. These include Dow Chemical Co.'s Gallant,which is used in France; Dow's Gauntlet, used in Italy, Spainand France; and Tokuthion, a pesticide used in Australia thatis manufactured in the U.S. by Mobay Chemical, a U.S. unit ofBayer AG.   Procymidone is approved for use in most wine-producingnations of the world and the levels detected by the Food andDrug Administration fall well within the tolerances of thosecountries. But the Environmental Protection Agency has neverdetermined if the fungicide poses a health hazard. In asomewhat curious move, procymidone's manufacturer, SumitomoChemical Co. of Japan, didn't bother to petition the EPA toset acceptable levels for the fungicide on imports.   &quot;There have never been any residues in wines that reachedthe U.S., and it wasn't anticipated that there would be aproblem,&quot; a Sumitomo spokesman explains.   Although Sumitomo still hasn't formally made its petitionto the EPA, the agency has begun its own toxicologicalinvestigation into the fungicide, which causes tumors inlaboratory animals in high doses. But officials believe thetiny amounts of procymidone found in wine shipments to date,mostly 0.03 to 0.04 parts per million, won't pose a healthrisk.   However minimal the hazards to consumers, the potentialtrade ramifications are huge. Americans buy more than $2billion of imported wine each year, mostly from Europe. Andunless a political compromise is reached, the threat ofdisrupted shipments threatens to go on for about two years,the time it typically takes the EPA to set residue levels forpesticides.   EPA officials are torn between protecting the free flow oftrade, in this case wine, and the public's health. &quot;The Foodand Drug Administration is obviously out there running theirenforcement program and that has potentially largeramifications for international trade,&quot; says Anne Lindsey,director of the EPA's registration division. &quot;On the otherhand, we can only establish a tolerance {residue level} if wecan reach the conclusion that it will protect the publichealth, and that process takes time.&quot;   Although procymidone is approved by the World HealthOrganization, some EPA officials privately complain its dataon the fungicide is flawed and inconsistent.   European Economic Community officials are scramblingbehind the scenes to come up with a political solution. Sincethe problem first surfaced, EC representatives have beenshuttling between Brussels and Washington in the hopes ofpersuading U.S. government officials to spare procymidonefrom a regulatory quagmire. &quot;The EC is seeking some interimrelief pending what they believe will be ultimate approval ofthe fungicide,&quot; says Robert Maxwell, president of theNational Association of Beverage Importers.   In the meantime, most wine importers are keeping mum aboutthe situation in an apparent attempt to distance their ownbrands as much as possible from the problem. But some, suchas Seagram Co. have quietly begun doing their own testing forprocymidone and they express anger at Sumitomo's negligencein not seeking U.S. clearance.   &quot;The issue is how could a responsible chemicalmanufacturer not have taken some action?&quot; fumes a Seagramspokesman. &quot;That's what's harmful and damaging.&quot;   Michael Aaron, president of Sherry-Lehmann, an upscalewine shop in Manhattan, puts it this way: &quot;Sumitomo's failureto register their product with the EPA is the equivalent of avineyard owner bottling his wine and forgetting to put in thecork.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
