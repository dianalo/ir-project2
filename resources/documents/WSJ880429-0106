Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GW </CO><IN> FLX TEL </IN><G> JUS </G><TEXT>   A federal appeals court ruled that a studio's licenses connected with showing movies on television don't automatically extend to videocassette distribution.    The impact of the decision on the entertainment industry is unclear, industry lawyers and executives said. It will depend largely on how many existing license contracts contain restrictive language similar to that involved in the appeals-court case.    The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled in favor of Herbert Cohen, whose company Bizarre Music Co. owned the copyright to the song &quot;Merry-Go-Round,&quot; licensed in 1969 to Handamp;J Pictures for use in the the movie &quot;Medium Cool.&quot; Handamp;J assigned its rights -- including the right to use the musical composition -- to Paramount Pictures Corp., which subsequently put the movie on videocassette. Mr. Cohen wanted additional compensation for the use of the song in &quot;Medium Cool&quot; videocassettes.    A district court previously had ruled in favor of Paramount, a unit of New York-based Gulf andamp; Western Inc., but the Ninth Circuit opinion by Judge Proctor Hug Jr., released Wednesday, reversed the decision.    &quot;The license does not expressly grant rights to use the composition in connection with a videocassette reproduction of the movie,&quot; the judge wrote.    Executives of several big movie companies said their lawyers are scambling to assess the impact of the decision. &quot;I can tell you, our people are looking at it right now,&quot; said Lee Rich, chairman and chief executive officer of MGM/UA Communications Co., Beverly Hills, Calif. &quot;I don't think anybody was aware of&quot; the case, Mr. Rich said.    Frank Rothman, a Los Angeles entertainment lawyer, said the impact of the decision, if it is upheld, depends on how many other contracts contain language similar to that in the Paramount case.    &quot;Most of the contracts I've looked at over the years have had much broader language,&quot; Mr. Rothman said, granting a license for use of the material in media that develop in the future.    &quot;It's hard to know how much of an impact it will have, unless one knows how many contracts a studio has with that kind of language,&quot; said Mr. Rothman, a partner in the New York-based firm of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher andamp; Flom.    A spokesman for Burbank, Calif.-based Walt Disney Co. said the entertainment concern is examining the decision and wouldn't comment until after its review is complete.    A spokeswoman for Paramount declined to comment on the decision.    In Los Angeles, a spokesman for the Screen Actors Guild said the union will examine the decision. He said it is unlikely that the decision will trigger new payments to the full casts of any movies, but said it might result in additional payments to certain actors who have individual contracts with studios.    The guild spokesman said that since the late 1970s, most movie contracts have included a &quot;universal exploitation&quot; clause allowing the movies to be distributed via any future technologies without additional compensation to the actors. However, he said many earlier contracts don't contain such clauses.    Paramount had argued that its videocassette rights were included by license provisions granting it the authority to record &quot;in any manner, medium, form or language&quot; the composition of the film, the decision explained.    However, the judge said, &quot;The authority to present the composition as part of the film is limited by the license to two mediums: theater and television. Videocassettes do not constitute exhibition by television.&quot;    TV broadcast differs &quot;fundamentally&quot; from VCR viewing, the judge ruled, noting that VCRs for home use weren't invented or contemplated in 1969, when the license was executed. And he concluded that any other interpretation would run counter to the purpose of the Copyright Act, the opinion concluded. </TEXT></DOC>
