Sun Co., an oil and gas concern based in Radnor, Pa., saidit will sell as much as 20% of Suncor, retaining a 55%interest in the Canadian concern, while the Ontariogovernment plans to sell its entire 25% stake.</LP><TEXT>   A source close to the transaction said the underwriters,Toronto investment dealers Wood Gundy Inc. and RBC DominionSecurities Inc., plan to market the shares at between C$23and C$25 each. At last report, Suncor had 54.4 million sharesoutstanding.   Suncor is one of the few companies with crude oil refiningand marketing assets that succeeded in turning a profit in1991. The company reported net income of C$77 million, orC$1.42 a share, down from C$124 million, or C$2.27 a share,in 1990 but a far cry from the big losses posted by industrygiants such as Petro-Canada. Suncor's refining and marketingoperations alone reported net of C$28 million, a Sun Co.spokesman said.   &quot;We believe the timing for this issue is very good becauseof the stellar earnings performance&quot; of Suncor, said TimHughes, director of investor relations for Sun.   The move is timely for the Ontario government, which holdsits 25% interest through a crown corporation, Ontario EnergyCorp. The province is trying to come to grips with a majorrecession and has warned that its deficit of C$9.7 billioncould widen to C$14.3 billion in the fiscal year beginningApril 1 if it doesn't cut spending. The issue could raise asmuch as C$340 million for the provincial government'scoffers.   Analysts said that if the stock is priced at about C$24 ashare, it probably will be well received by the market.Earlier reports had put the value of the company at as muchas C$1.6 billion, and investment industry sources said a C$23to C$25 share price would ensure strong interest.   Often described as one of the best-run integrated oilcompanies, with production activity as well as refining andmarketing operations, Suncor took the lead in cutting costsand operations, emerging from the process smaller but moreprofitable. In the late 1980s, Suncor management cut the workforce by about a quarter, sold 20% of the company's retailgasoline stations, reduced refining capacity and sold anumber of underperforming oil and gas properties and anundeveloped coal property.   Jim Doak, an analyst with First Marathon Securities Ltd.in Toronto, said Suncor also will benefit from the morerecent actions of other major players in the refining andmarketing business. Petro-Canada has already announced plansto deal with the overcapacity plaguing the industry byclosing or selling a third of its gas stations and idling orconverting two of its five refineries. Imperial Oil Ltd.,70%-owned by Exxon Corp., is expected to announce similarplans shortly.   The company said the issue is expected to be completed byearly March. The shares will be offered publicly in Canadaand Europe and by private placement in the U.S. Suncor saidit expects its 234,000 preferred shares outstanding will beconverted into common on completion of the offering or willbe redeemed by the company.   Suncor said it has declared a quarterly dividend rate of26 Canadian cents a share on its common stock, payable March18 to shareholders of record Feb. 28, a rate which companyofficials described as &quot;subject to normal periodicalreviews.&quot; Shares will be available for purchase on aninstallment basis, with the purchaser paying half the priceinitially and the remaining half about a year after theissue.</TEXT></DOC>
