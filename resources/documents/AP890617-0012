SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush's decision to offer protectionto all Chinese citizens in the United States has paved the way forat least two more Chinese diplomats to obtain refuge here.   A State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said Friday that besides the two Chinese diplomats who announced inSan Francisco they intended to defect, ``there have been additionalChinese officials who have asked for protection in the UnitedStates.''   He refused to give a specific number who have sought refuge, norto confirm a report that a husband and wife, both diplomats in theChinese Embassy in Washington, were the diplomats in question.   According to published and broadcast reports, those two are HanGuohong, secretary to the ambassador, and her husband Zhang Chiwei,an attache in the press office at the embassy in Washington. Therewas no one available for comment at the embassy early today.   The move to offer the additional Chinese diplomats refuge came asmore people were arrested in China for taking part in pro-democracyprotests and China's leaders increased efforts to absolve thegovernment of the bloody attack on protesters in Tiananmen Square.   The official said the Chinese diplomats who have asked forprotection have not formally asked for asylum, but could do so inthe future.   He explained that the diplomats are covered under Bush's decisionto grant all Chinese citizens in the United States permission toremain here until June 1990.   On Monday, Zhou Li-min, 26, a Chinese vice consul in SanFrancisco for cultural affairs, and Zhang Li-min, 25, vice consulfor overseas affairs, announced plans to defect. Immigrationofficials said the two were in hiding after meeting with FBI andimmigration authorities.   There are believed to be some 73,000 Chinese students in theUnited States, as well as some 250,000 visitors and business peoplewho could be eligible under Bush's offer.   Chinese diplomats based in Canada, Australia and Japan are alsoreported to have sought refuge in those countries.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush deploresthe persecutions of Chinese who demonstrated for democracy but hasno current plans to impose further sanctions or interruption ofrelations with China.   ``We continue to watch the situation,'' said Fitzwater. ``We'llcontinue to measure it as we go forward. Sanctions are always a partof that review, but we have nothing to announce.''   Bush has refused to affix blame for China's bloodshed but hassaid it would be ``extraordinarily difficult'' for the United Statesto have normal relations with officials responsible for the massacreof students and workers participating in pro-democracy protests.   U.S. officials repeatedly have stressed the importance of therelationship between the two countries and Washington's interest inretaining formal ties.   Fitzwater declined to characterize Bush's reaction to attempts byBeijing officials to rewrite the story of the bloody massacre twoweeks ago in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and claim that nodemonstrators were killed.   But he said anyone who has seen the television reports knows whathappened, despite the Chinese propaganda attempts.   ``Those matters all speak for themselves ... The pictures and thereality of the reporting has been so dramatic that these kind ofefforts stand beside them so starkly that I wouldn't even want totry to diminish that by giving it words,'' Fitzwater said.</TEXT></DOC>
