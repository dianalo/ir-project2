Earlier this month, the IRS won a case in U.S. Tax Courtchallenging underwearmaker Ithaca Industries' classificationof its &quot;assembled work force,&quot; made up mostly of factoryworkers, as a depreciable asset.</LP><TEXT>   Ithaca wrote off the value of the work force that itacquired in a leveraged buy-out in 1983, arguing that thework force had a &quot;life&quot; of just under seven years from theday it was acquired, much like the knitting mills and otherassets it purchased. The Tax Court disagreed.   Taking tax deductions for the depreciation of somethingyou can't touch has been a game that has fattened leveragebuy-out investors and rankled tax collectors for years.   The IRS has long tilted its lance at &quot;intangibles&quot; thattaxpayers claim are assets declining in value and deservingto be written down over time. But it wasn't until recentlythat the government has made any headway in its efforts topin down such deductions.   Ithaca hasn't yet decided whether to appeal the case orcough up the few million owed in back taxes and interest ifthe Tax Court's decision stands. But word of the decisionspread quickly through the network of tax attorneys, assetappraisers and leveraged buy-out advisers that blanket thecountry.   &quot;You can be sure that just about anybody who did an LBOhas got to be looking at this case, and just about everyone Iknow used an assembled work force&quot; as a depreciable asset,says Lehman Brothers tax expert Robert Willens.   He estimates that some companies may owe as much as $60million or $70 million to the IRS if their write-offs arereversed.   Appraisers, responsible for putting a dollar value and adepreciable life on any asset set before them, say assembledwork forces have been commonly treated as amortizable assetsfor tax purposes -- particularly in leveraged buy-outs donebefore the tax code changed in 1986.   The problem arises in some transactions when a buyer paysmore for a company than the appraised value of the underlyinghard assets, such as property and equipment. The excessamount is considered good will, which can't be written offunder current tax law.   To maximize tax benefits, some buyers assigned value toall sorts of &quot;intangibles,&quot; which then could be written off.In some cases, these &quot;intangibles&quot; included employees, aswell as customer lists, relationships with suppliers,patents, and contract rights. These were all treated asamortizable assets to stave off the day that the companywould have to pay tax.   Lehman's Mr. Willens says the Ithaca case opens the doorfor the IRS to attack the write-off of other intangibleassets.   An Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. partner, Karl Eschelbach, saysacquirers often came up with intangible assets &quot;with a winkand a nod, on the expectation that if they were challengedthey would negotiate their way out of it&quot; later on.   Some experts believe the IRS victory will make the taxmenmore aggressive in tracking down other such deductions. &quot;Ithink the government will be encouraged by this victory to goafter these types of intangibles that have not yet beenlitigated,&quot; says Burton Mirsky, partner at KPMG Peat Marwick.   Others argue that only a fraction of the leveragedbuy-outs completed in the last 20 years are likely to havequestionable intangibles listed in their tax returns. Andmost of those aren't paying taxes anyway, because interestexpenses eat up any taxable profits they might otherwisehave.   The question might become moot if Dan Rostenkowski has hisway. The Democratic representative from Illinois, who is alsothe chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee,has introduced a bill that would set a standard 14-yearamortization period for all intangible assets -- includinggood will.   That would end the tricky job of allocating the dollarspaid for a business to various assets, imagined or real. Itwould also ease the IRS's burden of scrutinizing mountains ofdeductions for intangibles and challenging those that itconsiders too ethereal.   &quot;The government can't police these anymore, its just toomuch,&quot; says Peat Marwick's Mr. Mirsky. &quot;They lose a lot ofcases, and a lot are slipping through the cracks,&quot; he adds.   A standard amortization period might help those dealsloaded with good will, giving companies a tax break wherebefore there was none. But a 14-year period could hurt otherdeals by stretching out the amortization of some intangibleassetssuch as covenants not to compete -- that are otherwisewritten off over just a few years. Spreading the tax breakover a longer period of time would dilute its impact,accountants say.   But Arthur Andersen's Mr. Eschelbach says the bill, if itpasses, would enhance the value of trademarks and tradenames, which haven't been amortizable in the past.   It would also help in the acquisition of televisionstations, for example, where much of the price is related tonetwork affiliation -- a slippery intangible from anaccounting point of view.   But it could hurt banks, whose core deposits -- anintangible asset already recognized by Tax Court -- arewritten off much faster, usually over six or seven years.</TEXT></DOC>
