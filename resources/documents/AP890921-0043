Government lawyers, opposing Hinckley's request to talk with thenews media, on Wednesday produced letters he wrote last yearthanking a man for sending him a semi-nude caricature of Miss Fosterthat Hinckley had requested.   The letters were read into the court record after Hinckley, whowants to meet with reporters to prove he is sane, testified hehadn't been ``obsessed, fixated (or) preoccupied'' with Miss Fosterfor five or six years.   Hinckley has ``consistently told us he had no thoughts aboutJodie Foster,'' testified psychiatrist Dr. Raymond Patterson. `Thesewritings tell us that is not true.''   Hinckley said after his arrest in the March 1981 assassinationattempt on President Reagan that his action was an effort to attractMiss Foster.   Psychiatrists treating Hinckley were unaware of the recentletters until they were turned over by the U.S. attorney's office,Patterson said. The Secret Service obtained the letters afterHinckley sent them.   U.S. District Court Judge June Green is considering Hinckley'srequest to conduct up to two interviews a month with the news media.The hearing resumes Monday.   ``Mr. Hinckley's concern is on (ABC TV's) `Prime Time,' not onhis mental health,'' testified Patterson, who said Hinckley suffersfrom a narcissistic personality disorder, characterized as a severemental illness.   Patterson said a symptom of Hinckley's illness is an inability todraw distinctions between the famous and infamous.   In his letter, read in court by Patterson, Hinckley thanked theman for the caricature, then referred to Manson.   ``I am not a follower, but he is one cool dude,'' Hinckley saidof Manson, leader of a cult whose members killed actress Sharon Tateand six others in 1969. Miss Tate was eight months pregnant when shewas murdered.   Patterson testified that Hinckley made references to Adolf Hitler``as recently as yesterday.'' The psychiatrist did not elaborate.   At the hearing, Janet Maher, a lawyer for the mental hospitalwhere Hinckley is staying, asked Hinckley whether he toldpsychiatrists that he considered himself ``Hitler's successor.''Hinckley replied he had not informed the psychiatrists. Maher didnot pursue that line of questioning further.   Hinckley was acquitted by reason of insanity in the shooting ofPresident Reagan, White House press secretary James Brady, aWashington police officer and a Secret Service agent. The shootingleft Brady partially paralyzed.   St. Elizabeths Hospital where Hinckley is a patient barsmaximum-security patients from conducting interviews with the media.It does permit such patients to correspond with reporters by mail.</TEXT></DOC>
