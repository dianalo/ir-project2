It suggested that I should have squeezed &quot;the most value out of existing revenues&quot; before I even thought of &quot;digging deeper into the pockets of taxpayers.&quot; Our record, however, contradicts your assertion.    1.In fiscal 1985-86, I reduced the state budget by $39 million, or about 3%, in order to balance at year end. In fiscal 1986-87, I cut another $75 million, about 5%. In both years these cuts were necessary because revenues weren't meeting appropriated amounts.    2.I implemented a hiring freeze in order to help meet the declining revenues of a slowing economy. When revenues continued to fall even lower, I announced a program to reduce state employment. From June 1986 to June 1987, we eliminated 1,000 state positions, a drop of 2.7%. Before the end of 1987 we will eliminate another 450. Even before this reduction Utah could boast of a public-employee work force that ranked 42nd in the nation on a per capita basis. If we exclude education, Utah has the fewest public employees per capita in the nation.    3.I implemented a plan to limit the growth of government to the combined growth rates of inflation and population (i.e. real per capita terms). My program has done better than cap expenditures. We have actually shrunk government by 1.7% per year, or an overall reduction of about 5%. By comparison, in the previous 20 years, real per capita expenditures grew by about 1.3% per year.    Utah state government is leaner and more cost-effective now than when I took office. We have squeezed more out of existing revenues. But there is another side to the tax increase. Utah has the fastest growing school-age population (measured in percentage growth) in the nation. From 1975 to 1985, Utah's school-age population (ages 5-17) increased by 30% while nationally school-age population decreased by 12%. Currently 26% of our state's population is of school age. The national average is only 19%. This has happened because of a large increase in the number of births per year in the state between 1976 and 1982. Much of this is due to large in-migration of the late 1970s.    It was necessary to raise taxes to shore up essential programs and to fund this tremendous growth in public-school enrollments. Despite the tax increase, Utah is in the paradoxical situation of spending more on education as a percentage of personal income and as a percentage of our state budget and still spending less per pupil than almost any other state.    The tax increase was an essential investment in Utah's future. By the year 2000, Utah's labor force will grow by more than 33% while the nation's labor force will grow by less than 15%. Properly educated, today's students in Utah will be tomorrow's trained labor force.    Perhaps the best measure of the fiscal responsibility of Utah state government is the AAA bond rating we have received from both Standard andamp; Poor's and Moody's. Upon giving us this rating, they said: &quot;While the Utah economy is not as broad or deep as some of the other six AAA states, the state has compensated by standing ready to react when necessary to any projected budget shortfalls. The demonstrated action of the state to keep things on an even keel and to balance the budget in difficult times was very positive.&quot;    Norman H.
