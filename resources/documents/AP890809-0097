The group of 29 Panamanians, including 10 military officers andlower-ranking soldiers, was briefly detained and then releasedafter Tuesday's incident, said Mercedes Morris, a spokeswoman forthe U.S. Southern Command.   She said the soldiers included Maj. Manuel Sieiro,brother-in-law of Manuel Antonio Noriega, the head of thePanamanian Defense Forces and Panama's de facto leader. Sieirocommands the Chorrera military zone, where the incident occurred.   A local mayor said the Panamanians began following the Americansafter the Marines encountered an anti-American demonstration. Thepro-government news media had called the American maneuvers aprovocation.   Ms. Morris said the incident occurred west of this capital citywhen about 40 U.S. Marines in armored vehicles were carrying out areconnaissance exercise on roads leading to the Panama Canal.   She said the Panamanians ``ventured without authorization into amilitary zone'' reserved exclusively for American forces.   Ms. Morris said the Panamanians were disarmed and held for aboutan hour and 15 minutes. She said their weapons, including machineguns and rifles, will be returned to the Panamanian Defense Forces.Five Panamanian journalists were in the detained group, but theyrefused comment.   There was no report of any Panamanian resistance.   A series of such minor incidents have been occurring sinceFebruary 1988, when two federal grand juries in Florida indictedNoriega on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges.   The United States has been trying to use economic sanctions anddiplomatic pressure to force out Noriega.   Most of the Panamanian-American incidents have involved exchangeof a few shots during the night or the arrest of Americans accusedof traffic violations.</TEXT></DOC>
