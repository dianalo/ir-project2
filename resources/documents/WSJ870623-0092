Townsfolk brought out &quot;$20 oil&quot; signs, balloons, bullhorns and cowbells. Police blew their sirens. Business leaders wearing ceremonial red jackets hailed motorists and offered them nonalcoholic champagne.    Few oil executives are ready to match such a celebration. But they do see some bright spots breaking through the gloom that has enveloped the oil patch since prices plunged last year from around $30 a barrel to less than $10.    With prices firmer and seeming to hold, drilling plans are cautiously expanding. The number of rigs in operation has crept up in recent weeks. Independent operators are once again manning their telephones in search of financing.    If the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries continues to restrain production, as expected, and the price of oil remains stable or rises further, this could be the beginning of a real upturn, oil men say.    Not that any such thing has happened yet, most caution. They say futures quotes on the mercantile exchange don't truly reflect prices posted by refiners in the nation's oil fields -- generally $16 to $20 a barrel. And they insist field postings will have to rise more than the average $4-a-barrel increase so far this year -- and stay up -- to offset the ravages of last year's price plunge.    In Oklahoma City, Raymond H. Hefner, both a drilling contractor and an oil producer, says only two of his 19 rigs are busy, &quot;and I don't remember our last exploratory well, probably about three years ago.&quot; He says exploration won't revive in Oklahoma until the price of petroleum is at least $25 a barrel. But even he concedes that &quot;the worst may be behind us.&quot;    &quot;It would be premature to say we are in a recovery,&quot; agrees H.B. Scoggins, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, &quot;but people's attitudes are more positive -- more in the nature that they're going to survive.&quot;    Some oil operators who have been idle the past few months are beginning to map new projects on fresh financing hopes. After slashing expenditure plans two years in a row, some bigger oil companies also are preparing to boost spending with higher cash flow and funds left over from thin but underspent first-half budgets.    Down the road from Perryton, for example, John Rex Jones, an Albany, Texas, oil operator, has drilled only two wells so far this year. But he now plans to participate in the drilling of 10 to 13 more wells by the end of the year. The total will be about the same as last year. &quot;We're still licking our wounds,&quot; he says.    Still, that's twice the number Mr. Jones had planned for 1987 before it became clear prices weren't going to stay as low as the $12 to $15 a barrel he received during much of last year. Last week, for example, the prices paid by refiners for benchmark West Texas crude advanced 50 cents a barrel, to $19. &quot;If the price goes to $25,&quot; Mr. Jones says, &quot;our drilling program will be doubled again.&quot;    Keeping up with Mr. Jones is Lester Moore, president of Moore Engineering andamp; Production Co., or Mepco, Evansville, Ind. &quot;It's still a little slow,&quot; says Mr. Moore. But Mepco's plans are to drill 10 to 12 wells in the Illinois Basin this year, all in the second half, he says. While that would still lag far behind Mepco's 37 wells in 1985, last year the concern didn't drill a single well. &quot;It was a disaster,&quot; Mr. Moore says. &quot;But our cash flow has improved,&quot; he adds, &quot;and we are going to get busy.&quot;    James Hawkins, a Tulsa, Okla., oil and gas operator, has just completed plans for an ambitious three-year drilling program for which he is trying to arrange $60 million in financing. &quot;Oil and gas have bottomed out,&quot; he says, &quot;and now is the time to take risks and invest.&quot;    Mr. Hawkins's optimism is echoed by some oil service companies that now see promise of profits again after heavy losses over the past 18 months. It's also reflected in increased drilling activity, most noticeably in the Gulf of Mexico.    The chief barometer of the health of the domestic oil industry is drilling -- as measured by wells completed and by active drilling rigs. There are signs of turnarounds in both numbers, though the drilling targets mainly appear to be low-risk, early-cash-flow prospects while wildcatting for new fields still languishes.    According to Petroleum Information Corp., which monitors oil and gas operations nationwide, well completions dropped nearly 50% to 35,955 in 1986. Through the first five months of this year, well completions fell an additional 45% to 8,642. But well starts are beginning to rise. Petroleum Information reports drilling began on 1,310 wells last month, compared with 1,069 wells in April.    Petroleum Information also cites an upward trend in recent weeks in indicators of future well activity. Last month, for example, permits to drill (operators' filings to state or federal agencies) rose sharply to 3,252 from 2,427 in April. And 164 seismic crews were busy last month, compared with 150 in April.    The most widely used guide to current drilling activity is the Baker Hughes Inc. weekly count of active rotary rigs. After peaking at 4,530 in December 1981, the rig count plunged last year to the lowest level since records have been kept. At the beginning of 1986, the year's high point, 1,915 rigs were working. By mid-July, the rig count was down to 663. On a year-to-year comparison, the declines continued through the first four months of 1987.    But in recent weeks, the rig count has perked up. According to yesterday's Baker Hughes weekly report, there were 800 rigs at work nationally last week, down 14 from the preceding week but sharply higher than the 720 rigs at work a year earlier. Offshore Data Services, which tracks offshore rigs world-wide, reports that the utilization rate in the Gulf of Mexico has been increasing steadily for more than a month.    As of yesterday, says Jerry Greenberg, Offshore Data's drilling editor, 104 mobile rigs were busy in the gulf, compared with 102 a week earlier and 68 a year earlier. Although a few more major oil companies are stepping up drilling in the gulf, he says, &quot;most of the activity is by the independents.&quot;    Higher oil prices clearly are behind the activity. At the beginning of 1987, many oil companies budgeted spending on an anticipated $15 price for oil. But since prices have firmed above that level, the companies are adjusting their planning. Exxon Corp., for example, recently raised its anticipated base price for 1987, for planning purposes, to $18 a barrel from the previous $15 level. Also, most companies assume prices of natural gas, which have been lagging behind those for oil, also will soon increase.    Herbert W. Krupp, senior energy economist at Bankers Trust Co., estimates that oil and gas wellhead revenues of the companies will total $76 billion this year, only slightly higher than last year's $71 billion. Even so, he says, there should be a significant increase in U.S. drilling expenditures for the second half.    Mr. Krupp expects the oil companies to allocate only about 17% of their wellhead revenues to drilling expenditures this year, a smaller percentage than in the past because of continued concern that prices could collapse again. That would suggest drilling spending of $11.6 billion for all of 1987, compared with last year's $12.4 billion. But Mr. Krupp notes that this year's spending pattern will be the reverse of 1986, when outlays began high and then declined. He estimates spending totaled only $4.9 billion in this year's first half and will rise to $6.7 billion for the second half.    As a result, says Mr. Krupp, the rig count should be up to 1,200 by the end of the year. That's in line with current industry projections ranging up to 1,300 for the year-end rig count. Still, for all 1987, the active-rig average is estimated to be only 970, compared with 964 last year. &quot;It's no boom,&quot; says an official of the International Association of Drilling Contractors. </TEXT></DOC>
