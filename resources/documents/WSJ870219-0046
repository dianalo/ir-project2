Analysts had projected the metal-coating company would earn about $1.60 a share for the year. The announcement, however, has caused analysts to drop their earnings estimates for the year to between $1.40 and $1.50 a share. For the previous year, Material Sciences earned $10.7 million, or $2.10 a share, on revenue of $113.7 million.    The company said sales for the year will exceed last year's total. Earnings had been expected to decline as the company shifted to newer technologies to electrogalvanize and rustproof the steel needed by the auto companies for their long-term no-rust warranties.    But delays occurred during the fourth quarter in getting the new equipment into operation at the company's plant near Toledo, Ohio. Analysts said the company six months ago had expected the plant to now be operating at 80% of capacity, but that it is only at 50% capacity. Analysts said other sheet metal-coating companies are having difficulties with the new technology as well, in some cases more than Material Sciences is experiencing.    Material Sciences also said operating results from its two companies acquired last year -- Deposition Technology Inc., San Diego, and Bloomfield, Conn.-based Scharr Industries Inc. -- have also fallen short of management's expectations. </TEXT></DOC>
