But he wasn't quite ready for theflood inside.   Cattle filled the Milwaukee Stockyards, where Mundth and otheranxious farmers gathered to sell their animals in what has becomeanother casualty of the Midwest's worst drought in 50 years.   Business is booming at stockyards and auction barns across theheartland as farmers, faced with hay shortages and rising feedprices, are liquidating their herds. The selling frenzy, meanwhile,has pushed down livestock prices.   ``It's not an easy ballgame to play,'' said Mundth, a Reedsburg,Wis., farmer, who last week sold a dozen steers. ``No oneappreciates selling when it's a buyer's market. They (buyers) wereenjoying the feast.''   ``These slaughterhouses are all filled up,'' he added. ``All ofthese animals that have flooded the market ... it's veryupsetting.''   Mundth said his steers were ready for market, but other farmersfearing lower prices and hay shortages are sending beef cattle toslaughter before they are mature and in some cases are selling offdairy cattle.   ``Some of the people look at the feed supply and feel they'regoing to take whatever they can,'' said Norbert Brandt, generalmanager of the Midwest Livestock Producers Cooperative inWisconsin. `It's a very tense situation, very demoralizing.''   ``Some of them think prices will go down even more,'' he added.``Every day that goes by without rain, the situation is that muchmore worse.''   The liquidation in recent weeks has been a boon to Midwestauction houses, which charge a commission to the seller. ChuckLevitt, a market analyst, estimated the drought may be bringing anadditional 10,000 to 15,000 cattle to market each week.   There has also been an increase in hog and sows beingslaughtered because of higher price of feed, but the jump has notbeen as great as the increase in the number of cattle.   In southern Missouri, officials at the Ozark Regional Stockyardslast week had a record number of cattle sold. The 5,650 head was 1{times the number sold in the same period in 1987.   At the Milwaukee Stockyards, a 20 percent to 30 percent increasein receipts was posted last week, said cattle salesman Bob Strauss.   ``There's a little bit of panic selling,'' he said. ``Peopleneed money all the time in farming. If that's all you've got, yousell whatever sells the best.''   But selling now means less profit. Strauss said cows early thisweek were 39 cents a pound, a sharp drop from the 51-52 cents oftwo weeks ago.   Some also fear the rush to market now could have direconsequences later.   ``That old cow is the factory,'' said Russ Harriman, executivevice president of the Missouri Cattlemen's Association. ``She's theone that produces next year's calf crop. If you don't have afactory, you don't have a calf crop, you don't have anything tosell next year.''   And for those who sell and want to start over, competition willbe fierce.   ``When people all want to rebuild the herd, they're going to bebidding against each other,'' said C. William Swank, executive vicepresident of the Ohio Farm Bureau.   To help farmers and slow the culling of herds, Ohio and someother Midwest states have begun hotlines to match people needinghay with those who have it.   Swank also said while consumers will enjoy lower prices inupcoming weeks, eventually meat supplies will shrink and shopperswill feel the pinch.   ``The consumers better load up their home freezers this fall,''said Levitt, senior livestock analyst at Shearson Lehman HuttonInc. in Chicago. ``Next spring's prices could be record highs.''   Mundth, 33, said if he'd had more grain, he would have held hissteers longer. But he said he was concerned about falling pricesand estimated he already lost $1,600 by not selling 10 days sooner.   He hopes to recoup some of his losses this fall but noted that``our profits are so minimal, it's extremely difficult to make upfor it. ... It looks very highly unlikely this is going to be avery good year.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Sharon Cohen is the AP Midwest regionalreporter, based in Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
