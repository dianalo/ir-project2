Garcia</HL><DD> 04/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices surged on the coattails of a more stable dollar and a bond market rally. But a sudden interest rate shock just after the close portends heavy selling pressure this morning, traders said.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 26.28 points to 2304.69. It began with a strong spurt, aided by some European and Japanese buying. The average then retraced all of its early gains by midday, but gathered steam again as the bond market rallied through the afternoon. Traders said they saw both institutional and individual investor buying.    The advance in bond prices through much of yesterday, coupled with interest rate declines in the wake of the Federal Reserve's permanent addition of reserves to the banking system through purchases of Treasury coupons yesterday afternoon seemed to allay investors' worries about rising interest rates.    But, in a shocking about-face shortly after the close, Citibank, and later Chase Manhattan Bank, both lifted their prime lending rates to 7 3/4% from 7 1/2%.    In the Sandamp;P futures pit in Chicago, where the settlement price often comes well after 4 p.m. Eastern Time, the price of the June Sandamp;P 500 futures contract was quickly marked down from the healthy premium it had maintained over the index itself through the day to a significant 0.45 discount. That spurred immediate predictions of strong selling pressure on today's stock market opening.    The reaction in the bond market, where trading sometimes continues for hours after the stock market closes, was even more savage. In a matter of minutes late yesterday afternoon, Treasury bond price gains of about 1/2 point suddenly became declines of nearly a full point.    Investors on the Pacific Stock Exchange, which closes at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time, had only the Citibank announcement to react to yesterday, because the Chase Manhattan cut wasn't announced until 5:10 p.m. But they sold down some popular stocks anyway. Among such issues losing ground from their New York closes in late Pacific exchange trading, Digital Equipment dropped 1, General Electric 1/2, Du Pont 3/8, Texas Instruments 1/2 and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph 1/8.    William LeFevre, a market strategist with Advest Inc., said the recent poor behavior of the Dow Jones Utility Average has been &quot;telling us that rates are going up.&quot; The average has failed to surpass its record of 227.83 set Jan. 22. Yesterday, this average of 15 stocks rose just 0.52 to 212.69.    The broader averages kept pace with the industrial average. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index moved up 2.50 to 291.70, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.33 to 165.89.    Volume on the Big Board contracted to 171.8 million shares from 208.4 million Monday. Advancers outpaced decliners by a 9-to-5 margin.    Yesterday &quot;really wasn't a true test (for the market) and later this week we might see where sentiment really lies, because yesterday was the final day of the quarter,&quot; said John LaPorte, director of research at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.    Traders said that many money managers were probably eager to bid up stock prices by buying a few shares yesterday because their portfolios are valued for the quarter based on last night's closing prices. The bulk of their purchases for the first quarter were probably completed last week. Some traders are worried that stocks will be up for sale again, adding more downward pressure on the stock market.    Technology and drug stocks rebounded after the beating they took Monday. Digital Equipment rose 4 5/8 to 161 5/8, Unisys moved up 7/8 to 97 1/2, Honeywell added 3/8 to 70 1/2, Cray Research advanced 4 5/8 to 124 5/8 and Hewlett-Packard rose 5/8 to 56 7/8.    In the over-the-counter market, Apple Computer moved up 2 to 64 1/2, Tandem Computers gained 2 to 71 1/4 and Lotus Development rose 3/4 to 22 1/4.    International Business Machines, one of the few stocks that advanced during Monday's rout, fell 2 1/4 to 150 1/8.    United Technologies gained 2 1/4 to 50 7/8. The company said that its Pratt andamp; Whitney unit had been selected by Swissair to provide engines for its new fleet of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft. The order could total more than $470 million.    Auto stocks posted hefty gains. Jack Kirnan at Kidder Peabody recommended General Motors and Ford, expecting dramatic earnings gains from these companies this year and in 1988, partly because of the auto makers' efforts to cut costs and improve products.    Money center bank, thrift and insurance stocks were mostly lower. Wells Fargo lost 1 1/4 to 47 1/8, Citicorp eased 1/2 to 50 1/2, J.P. Morgan eased 1/8 to 43 1/8, Chase Manhattan was unchanged at 38 3/8, Travelers fell 1 5/8 to 47 1/8 and Great Western Financial declined 1 1/2 to 50 1/4.    Ames Department Stores fell 1 3/4 to 23 1/8. The company said it expects earnings of between 72 cents and 77 cents a share for its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, compared with earnings of $1.19 in fiscal 1986.    J.C. Penney rose 1 3/8 to 99. The retailing company declared a 2-for-1 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend 19%.    Borg-Warner advanced 2 to 49 1/8 in active trading. GAF proposed to acquire Borg-Warner in a $46-a-share tender offer, provided Borg-Warner's board recommends the bid. The proposal was announced before the day's trading began, and Borg-Warner opened at 47 5/8. Borg-Warner withheld comment pending study of the GAF plan. GAF rose 1 1/2 to 48 1/2.    GenCorp rose 2 3/8 to 116 5/8. The company, target of a takeover offer by General Partners, a group including AFG Industries and Wagner andamp; Brown, said it doesn't plan to pay a premium price to buy back shares from any shareholder group at the expense of other shareholders. General Partners, which owns a 9.8% stake in GenCorp, recently threatened to escalate its takeover battle.    Exxon moved up 1 1/4 to 85 3/4. The oil company said it plans to purchase Delhi Petroleum for about $690 million. Delhi is currently owned by CSR, an Australian conglomerate.    Gold and other mining stocks weakened as precious metals prices sagged in futures trading. ASA fell 3 3/8 to 59 1/8, Newmont Mining slid 2 1/4 to 94 3/4, Reynolds Metals declined 1 to 62 3/4, Asarco lost 1 3/4 to 22 7/8, and Echo Bay Mines dropped 1/2 to 39. </TEXT></DOC>
