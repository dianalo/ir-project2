The suit in California Superior Court here seeks nearly $2.5 billion in damages from the defendants, including $1.5 billion in punitive damages from Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs was Unocal's financial adviser in its successful battle against Mesa Chairman T. Boone Pickens Jr.    Also named as defendants were Robert M. Freeman, a partner at Goldman Sachs, and Richard B. Wigton, Timothy L. Tabor and Martin A. Siegel, former officers of Kidder Peabody. Three of the men have been indicted in the insider-trading case that has grown out of the Ivan Boesky scandal. Mr. Siegel agreed two months ago to plead guilty to two felonies in connection with the scandal.    The suit charges breach of contract and fiduciary duty, fraud, negligence and conspiracy, and parallels allegations handed up last week by a federal grand jury in New York against Messrs. Freeman, Wigton and Tabor. Unocal's suit seeks $2 million in profits, fees and commissions the defendants allegedly obtained from the purchase or sale of shares based on nonpublic information, and $17 million in restitution of fees and commissions paid to Goldman Sachs by Unocal in 1985 and 1986.    Unocal also seeks at least $750 million in &quot;consequential damages&quot; stemming from a Unocal stock buyback that was the heart of the company's takeover defense.    In addition to the $1.5 billion punitive award being sought from Goldman Sachs, the Unocal suit seeks $100 million of punitive damages from Kidder Peabody, $50 million from Mr. Freeman and $5 million each from Messrs. Wigton, Tabor and Siegel.    A Goldman Sachs spokesman said, &quot;We haven't as yet seen the Unocal complaint, but together with our counsel we have carefully reviewed over the past several months the circumstances of the Unocal transaction.    &quot;On the basis of this review, we believe that the Unocal claims against our firm are frivolous and totally without merit, and we will vigorously defend against these claims.&quot;    A spokesman for Kidder, a unit of General Electric Co., said the firm hasn't yet seen the Unocal suit and has no comment at this time.    Mr. Wigton's attorney, Stanley Arkin, wouldn't comment on the suit, and attorneys for the other defendants didn't return phone calls yesterday.    Unocal's suit charges that Goldman Sachs's advice to Unocal &quot;was tainted and biased and resulted in substantial gain for Goldman Sachs.&quot;    Before being retained by Unocal, the suit alleged, Goldman had acquired a substantial arbitrage position in call option contracts for Unocal common stock; such a move usually indicates that the stock is expected to rise. Goldman, which &quot;fraudulently concealed&quot; the position from Unocal, according to the suit, later bought 150,000 Unocal shares without a disclosure. Goldman's holdings in Unocal created &quot;a conflict of interest between its fiduciary obligation to serve Unocal and its own desire to obtain profits&quot; from its Unocal position, the suit said.    Some of Unocal's allegations reflected charges of securities violations previously made by the U.S. government. But Unocal's suit was more specific in its charges of conflict of interest at Goldman and insider trading among the two investment banking concerns.    Unocal's suit charged Goldman with a conflict in several recommendations it made in helping Unocal shape a $72-a-share exchange offer for its common stock. The swap of senior secured notes for stock, which eventually totaled $4.15 billion, at first was designed to discourage the takeover attempt by a Mesa-led partnership, which by March 1985 had acquired about 13.6% of Unocal.    Unocal claimed that Goldman proposed the swap offer, announced April 17 of that year, &quot;to threaten the Mesa group with unacceptable consequences&quot; if Mesa acquired majority control. Goldman explained to Unocal that its plan, calling for Unocal to buy back as many as 87.2 million shares, was a way to &quot;force the Mesa group to drop its tender offer&quot; without Unocal ever having to buy back the shares, Unocal said in the suit.    But on April 19, Goldman exercised its call options at $45 a share and acquired 150,000 Unocal common shares, the suit alleged. And on April 20 and 21, Mr. Freeman and other Goldman representatives advised that Unocal's exchange-offer plan &quot;wasn't working as intended&quot; and that Unocal should instead offer to buy back 50 million of its shares regardless of whether Mesa's tender offer was successful.    Unocal executives &quot;reluctantly&quot; accepted the advice and on April 22 Unocal's board approved the 50 million-share repurchase offer, the suit said.    A Unocal spokesman said that the company &quot;believes we may have been successful (in the defense against Mesa) even if we had bought somewhat less&quot; than the 57.7 million Unocal shares that eventually were repurchased after Unocal reached an agreement with Mesa in May 1985.    The suit said because of Goldman's advice, &quot;Unocal was forced to incur a debt in excess of $3 billion&quot; in connection with the buyback. Further, Unocal had to accept certain restrictions when it followed Goldman's recommendation that it establish a publicly traded limited partnership for most of its oil and gas operations as part of the anti-takeover defense, Unocal charged.    The suit also charged that the four men &quot;knowingly made illegal securities transactions based upon inside nonpublic information which they swapped with each other, including information related to Unocal.&quot;    The claim for punitive damages stems from Unocal's charge that the defendants acted &quot;maliciously, intentionally, willfully, wantonly and in reckless disregard&quot; of Unocal's rights, the suit said.    Meanwhile, a Unocal investor, Donald M. Abramson, sued on behalf of certain Unocal holders. The suit was filed Monday in federal court in Manhattan against Kidder, Goldman and the four men, seeking damages on behalf of investors who bought Unocal put options or dealt in Unocal securities involving the sale of such puts from April 13, 1985, to May 17, 1985. The suit draws on previous government accusations that Kidder made millions of dollars in an insider-trading scheme involving Mr. Siegel and the others, partly through the purchase of Unocal options.    Messrs. Freeman, Wigton and Tabor are scheduled to be arraigned on criminal charges related to the case tomorrow.    In addition, the defendants in the Abramson case are named, along with Mr. Boesky, in a suit brought last month by a Carnation Co. investor, Michael Asimow. That suit seeks damages on behalf of certain Unocal investors, along with investors in Bendix Corp., Carnation, Continental Group Inc., Getty Oil Co., Natomas Inc. and Storer Communications. Lawyers involved in the suits say many more are expected. &quot;This is a harbinger of things to come,&quot; said David Berger, a Philadelphia attorney who brought the latest action for Mr. Abramson.    Attorneys for Kidder and Goldman said they hadn't seen the Abramson suit and wouldn't comment. Mr. Wigton's attorney also declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
