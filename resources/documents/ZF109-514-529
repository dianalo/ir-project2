 Earlier work on document processing at the IBMlaboratory in Charlotte, North Carolina, from the late 1970s to 1980,resulted in some key building blocks for this system.andP;  However, recentadvances in technology have allowed desings that had proved to be impracticalin those earlier times.andM;The memory required for a single image frame might have occupied severalcubic feet in 1980, but now fits on a single PC card.andP;  Very large-scaleintegration (VLSI) has also brought the logic to practical size, cost, andperformance levels.andP;  Technological capability now exists for high-resolutionimage capture at rates as high as 40 frames per second.andP;  With the promise offuture development of consumer-based, high-definition digital television,continued improvements in cost and performance are projected.andP;  There is asimilar promise of development improvement of mass storage media driven byoptical and magnetic storage technologies.andM;The initiation of the transaction system development discussed this paper wascustomer driven.andP;  Several major banks came to the same conclusion about thereadiness of image technology to be used as a solution to their documentprocessing needs.andP;  The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston asked the IBM CharlotteLaboratory to demonstrate the use of image in the high-speed capture,archiving, and retrieval of images of U.S.andP;  Treasury checks.andP;  Thatdemonstration was completed successfully in 1989.andM;As a result and in consultation with our banking customers, an architecturewas formulated; its guidelines ensured that the image solutions would bereadily assimilated into present and future operational banking environments.andO;Keys to this end are the treatment of image data as ordinary coded data,migration in an orderly fashion from the present customer applications toimage applications, and building a system core and applications on thestrategic foundations associated with future processing, storage management,and communications building blocks as we could foresee them.andP;  We now presentdetails of the HPTS architecture, system design implementation, performance,applications, and future considerations.andM;The need for a High Performance Transaction System (HPTS) centers around theproblem of today'sandM;bank check processing environment.andP;   This is a highlyandM;automated paper-based process, with machine-readable check encoding as themethod of tracking and sorting the checks at very high speeds.andP;  After twogenerations of hardware and software improvement, the resulting improvementof paper-handling efficiency was growing less and less cost efficient.andP;  Costsare now rising with the cost of the remaining labor content.andP;  Check volumescontinue to increase, and this keeps a constant pressure on cost control andthe quality of customer service.andP;  Image technology offers the promise ofbeing the breakthrough to eliminate the high cost of paper handling, therebyreversing the upward trend in costs.andP;  A system solution is key to asuccessful conversion.andP;  With many large banks already relying on largeMVS-based hosts to handle the check process, these banks need anuninterrupted, unfailing process even during conversion to the new system.andO;The system architecture chosen would have to be one that provides forevolution within a normal data-processing environment.andM;Migration from a conventional paper-and-coded-data system to animage-and-coded-data system must be staged, starting from the presentMVS-based systems.andP;  The migration, which must be carried out on severalplanes, is as important as creating the ultimate system design.andP;  The checkprocessing system is actually many separate applications, and the imageconversion must migrate through multiple applications at a time to maintainuninterrupted order at the bank.andP;  New applications that are not possiblewithout image capability may be added in the future.andP;  A platform that allowsconvenient growth to these is required.andP;  One example of an application thatwas not possible prior to image processing was the one in which an image of acheck is returned to the bank's customer rather than the actual paper check.andM;Finally, flexibility to future environmental changes in the host system isrequired.andP;  Check processing systems are expected to last many years andseveral computer generation cycles.andP;  Of high importance is the need for thearchitecture to be strategic in nature, so that applications remainfunctional, not only in today's but also in future data processing systems.andM;The concept that image data should be treated as much as possible like normaldata is central to the HPTS architecture.andP;  Once this is achieved, mostprevious art practiced for today's data processing can be applied.andP;  Ratherthan building a completely new data-processing infrastructure for imageprocessing, image has adapted to the present one.andP;  Carrying this concept astep further, those areas adopted are the strategic areas.andP;  Access methods,operating systems, communications, user access, programming languages, and soon all conform to that supported by Systems Application Architecture [TM](SAA [TM]).andP;  These strategic areas are in concert with future systemstrategies within IBM that are associated with the traditional coded dataworld.andM;The key system operating points were established by identifying thesignificant elements in a matrix of key parameters, processing image data forthose elements, and evaluating the results for adequacy to perform theapplications.andP;  The following are the parameters we evaluated:andM;* Resolution--120, 200, 240, and 300 picture elements per inchandM;* Document speed--240, 345, 400, and 450 inches per secondandM;* Compression algorithms--International Telegraph and Telephone ConsultativeCommittee Group Three Standard and Group Four Standard (CCITT 3 and 4),Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM), and Adaptive Bilevel ImageCompression (ABIC)andM;* Scanner--Reticon Charge Coupled Photodiode (CCPD) 128 by 8 and1024-element, low-light deviceandM;* Presentation--Black and white, gray scale, and mix of low resolution grayscale with high-resolution black and whiteandM;Description of the architectureandM;The High Performance Transaction System (HPTS) image record conforms to theIBM Image Object Content Architecture (IOCA).andP;  This architecture provides astandard definition for representing images and the conventions tointerchange images.andP;  Figure 1 illustrates the record layout used.andP;  In orderto accommodate the range of future HPTS applications, several forms of objectdata are required in the record as illustrated by object data 1, 2, .andP;  .  . andO;n.andP;  That is, object 1 might contain the black-and-white rendition; object 2might contain a gray-scale rendition of the same target; object 3 mightcontain a window, and so forth.andP;  Application-coded data are carried as a leadheader, and these data have fields that allow for many applications.andP;  The IBMMixed Object Document Content Architecture (MO:DCA) data stream is utilizedto interchange data among applications and environments.andM;Figure 2 illustrates the applications that this architecture supports, shownin a wheel-like display.andP;  The core structure at the wheel's hub supports bothpresent and envisioned future applications.andP;  The presentation forms of imagesrequired for each application vary with the application.andP;  Therefore, thecapability is provided to have multiple forms within the record and to changethose forms with time.andP;  The IOCA format accommodates variedresolutions,compressions, and other image presentation characteristics.andP;  Theinitial HPTS offering uses two forms of image.andP;  A black-and-white resolutionimage is used for applications such as unrestrained handwritten amountrecognition and keying, and gray-scale medium-resolution images for viewingcheck endorsements.andP;  The concept of a black-and-white image is illustrated inFigure 3.andP;  All image information is depicted as either black (1) or white (0)generated by the dynamic thresholding algorithm discussed in Reference 1.andO;The requirements for HPTS call for the black-and-white resolution to be 240picture elements per inch.andM;Figure 4 illustrates an 80-pel gray-scale form.andP;  This form is used as anotherset of objects in the record format.andP;  Here the image information is depictedas a 4-bit word giving 16 possible levels of gray.andP;  Both the black-and-whiteand gray-scale images are compressed with the same bilevel algorithm, ABIC,that normally deals with only binary, such as the high-resolution,black-and-white images.andP;  The figure illustrates how the gray-scaleinformation is preprocessed to a form that can be conveniently handled by thebilevel compression algorithm.andP;  In this case, the darkest regions are codedas a binary 15 or binary 1111, midlevel gray as a 10 or binary 1010, andlight gray as a 5 or binary 0101.andP;  When each respective ordered bit of theimage is arranged specially in its own bit plane, i.e., the 20, 21, 22, and23 bit planes, each plane can be processed separately as a bilevel image.andO;These data planes are then serialized separately and concatenated to form onecontinuous bilevel form that is compressed by ABIC.andP;  The reverse processtakes place when the image is reconstructed.andM;With the data record defined, the operating and communication environmentsround out the key elements of the architecture.andP;  The Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA) was chosen as the overall architecture.andP;  The initialoperating system environments are MVS/ESA [TM] and OS/2 [R], as shown inFigure 5.andP;  These base operating system environments are utilized withoutmodification.andP;  Core and application functions built on these bases arestrategic, in that they are not only portable between SAA environments, butthey also will be part of future operating systems growths and improvements.andO;LU 6.2 was chosen for communication, thereby bringing to the base elementsthe IBM strategic network architecture.andM;Overall, the objective of bringing the HPTS image technology into the SAAtechnology of coded data has been accomplished.andP;  Questions of particularconfigurations for individualized solutions can be answered in the followinggeneric way.andP;  If there is a solution for coded data, that same solutionapplies to HPTS image data.andM;System design implementationandM;ImagePlus HPTS consists of several hardware components, and system softwareand application software components.andP;  The IBM approach to developing HPTS hasbeen to provide a set of core hardware and software products upon which imageapplications may be built.andP;  Included is a description of the system andapplication design implementation.andP;  For purposes of this discussion, thesystem software developed in the IBM Charlotte Laboratory and to which theimage applications interface is referred is called the core software.andM;The HPTS architecture is built upon a base of existing IBM hardware andsoftware products that includes the following:andM;* System/370 [TM] mainframe processorandM;* IBM 389X/XP Document ProcessorsandM;* Optical and magnetic storage mediaandM;* MVS/Enterprise Systems Architecture operating system (MVS/ESA)andM;* System Management Software/Data Facility Product (SMS/DFP)andM;* Virtual storage access method (VSAM)andM;* DB2 [TM] databaseandM;* Advanced function printing (AFP)andM;* Check Processing Control System (CPCs)andM;* PS/2 [R] workstations and peripheralsandM;* Token-Ring NetworkandM;* OS/2 Extended EditionandM;HPTS platform and data flow.andP;  The HPTS hardware and software systemillustrations in Figures 6 and 7 provide an overview of the ImagePlus HPTSplatform.andP;  A description of the flow of image and coded data through thevarious system components follows.andM;Images of documents--checks, remittances, drafts, and so forth--are capturedat a rate as high as forty items per second on the IBM 389X/XP DocumentProcessors, through the addition of the IBM 3897 Image Capture System, whichcontains image cameras and image prcessing logic.andP;  The MVS/ESA host is theimage server utilizing standard DASD, tape, and optical disk via the ObjectAccess Method (OAM).andP;  All image processing, including compression anddecompression, occurs outside the host.andP;  Workstations access the imageobjects for both high-speed and low-speed applications with decompression andrecognition occurring in special Micro Channel [R] cards under OS/2.andO;Standard system printers, PS/2 workstations, displays, and scanners are allalso utilized.andP;  Strategic access methods, such as Object Access Method (OAM)and virtual storage access method (VSAM), are utilized along with thestrategic Check Processing Control System (CPCS).andP;  The systems shown cansupport a large range of customer check processing load requirements farsurpassing the largest requirement today of one thousand transactions persecond peak capability.andM;These images are transmitted to the MVS-based mainframe via achannel-to-channel (CTC) attachment and are stored in an object database viaImage Host Application Services (IHAS).andP;  The coded (nonimage) data aretransmitted to the mainframe via an Advanced Program-to-ProgramCommunications (APPC) (LU6.2) attachment.andP;  Coded data management, control,and reporting are handled by the Check Processing Control System (CPCS).andO;After the capture of the image and the coded data from the 389X/XP, data aretransmitted from the MVS-based mainframe to one of two token-ring local areanetwork (LAN) configurations with PS/2 workstations for image applicationprocessing.andM;There are two paths to the LAN for data, both of which are used in thehigh-speed, image processor LAN configuration.andP;  This configuration supportsapplications, such as key entry, which require character recognition andsubsecond response time.andP;  The second LAN configuration uses a single path fordata traveling from the host.andP;  We now discuss these two data paths.andM;A channel-to-channel (CTC) connection is made between the MVS-based mainframeand the PS/2 workstations via the image processor.andP;  For high-speed,data-extensive applications, such as key entry, this path is used for imagestraveling from the mainframe to the LAN.andM;An IBM 3174 connection is made between the MVS-based mainframe and the PS/2workstations using LU 6.2 protocol.andP;  In the thigh-speed LAN configuration(which also has a channel-to-channel image processor path), the LU 6.2 pathis used to send coded data [e.g., Check Processing Control System (CPCS) MassData Set (MDS) records] to and from the host.andP;  In the alternate LANconfiguration, which has the single LU 6.2 path, the LU 6.2 path is used tosend coded data to and from the host, image data from the host toworkstations, and images from workstations (where they have been captured vialow-speed scanners) to the host.andM;As indicated in the High Performance Transaction System (HPTS) softwarearchitecture shown in Figure 7, the HPTS platform consists of the followingfour uniqueworkstation types.andM;IBM 3898 Image Processor.andP;  This is an industrial-type PS/2 that uses theIntel 80386 [R] chip and houses hardware for image compression,decompression, and character recognition (RECO).andP;  The processor also housesthe associated device driver and image processing core software, known asImage Processing Recognition Services (IPRS).andP;  The image processor is aspecial-purpose workstation whose primary function is image management anddistribution.andP;  There is no application software in this workstation, and,during normal operation, there is no interface to an operator.andM;Workstation manager.andP;  A PS/2 Model 70 or 80 houses the core softwarecomponent, called Image Management Workstation Facility (IMWF), and the imageapplication manager.andP;  The image application manager is discussed in moredetail later in this paper under the heading, &quot;HPTS application architectureframework.&quot;andP;  The workstation manager is a special-purpose workstation whoseprimary function is application management and image tracking on the localarea network (LAN).andP;  During normal operation there is an interface to anoperator in support of the LAN configuration and set-up.andM;Image entry workstation.andP;  A PS/2 Model 55SX is the image entry workstationwith a medium-resolution display (IBM 8503) that is used for high-speed,image-assisted data entry.andP;  This workstation houses the core softwarecomponent, called image entry workstation facility, which includes theapplicable workstation and communication service routine subcomponents of theImage Management Workstation Facility.andP;  The workstation also houses imageapplication software.andP;  The image entry workstation is a typical workstationwhose primary function is to serve as the interface between the imageapplication software and the operator.andM;Image extended workstation.andP;  This workstation is a PS/2 Model 60 or higherwith a high-resolution display (IBM 8514) that is used for such extendedimage application functions as image compression and decompression at theworkstation using Document Storage System (DSS) card, image printing on anIBM 4019 workstation printer, and optical disk medium storage and retrieval.andO;This workstation is also used for low-speed image capture on such scanners asthe IBM 3119.andP;  Coded data capture is also supported via a code-line reader.andO;The image extended workstation houses the core software component, calledImage Extended Workstation Facility, which includes the appropriateworkstation and communication service routine subcomponents of the ImageManagement Workstation Facility.andP;  It also houses image application software.andO;The image extended workstation is a typical workstation whose primaryfunction is to serve as the interface between the image application softwareand an operator.andM;Upon completion of image application processing on the LAN, all coded dataupdates and newly captured images are transmitted back to the host processorvia the LU 6.2 (3174) connection.andP;  The host image applications use theservices of Check Processing Control System (CPCS) to process and store thecoded data updates and the services of IHAS to process, store, and printimages.andM;HPTS system software building blocks.andP;  The system or core software componentsupon which the image applications are being built are the following:andM;* Check Processing Control System (CPCS)andM;* MVS Host Support Program (HSP)andM;* IBM 3890/XP MVS SupportandM;* Image Application Library Services (ALS)andM;* Image Host Application Services (IHAS)andM;* Image Workstation Application Services (IWAS)andM;* IP Recognition Services (IPRS)andM;Check Processing Control System (CPCS).andP;  The primary functions include codeddata management, control, and reporting.andP;  This product is enhanced to supportimage by providing such functions as priority processing (which allows acustomer to direct the sequence in which the application tasks areprocessed), unencoded item capture, electronic item capture, andsystem/workflow management.andM;Although CPCS is a key component of HPTS, it is important to note that IBMimplementation of an open-ended architecture provides the means whereby anon-CPCS customer may install the other components of HPTS and bridge them toother existing item processing systems.andM;MVS Host Support Program (HSP).andP;  This core software component providesseveral functions, including simulation tools for IBM 389X/XP DocumentProcessors and MVS driver code for 389X/XP Document Processors.andP;  The primaryfunction used in support of image is the Advanced Program-to-ProgramCommunications (APPC) software support for the LU 6.2 (3174) coded data andlow-speed image path between the MVS host and the image workstations on theLAN.andM;3890/XP MVS Support.andP;  This product provides several functions to supportdocument processing applications and is a prerequisite for CPCS and HPTSproducts.andP;  The 3890/XP MVS Support provides macros with which a user maywrite sort programs for 389X/XP Document Processors, and it also provides thequeued sequential access method (QSAM) modules needed to supportchannel-attached document processors.andP;  This support further provides asimulator that allows the user to capture data from disk, then pass the datathrough the user sort programs and create CPCS records without the use of adocument processor.andM;Image Host Application Services (IHAS).andP;  IHAS is a feature of the ImageApplication Library Services (ALS) that is a set of mainframe services usedby all applications to access images in the image database, to access codeddata results from image compression, decompression, and character recognition(RECO), and to access image document window coordinate and processingparameters.andP;  IHAS also provides facilities for printing images on high-speedmainframe printers (such as the 3835) and for transmitting images toworkstations on a LAN.andM;Image Workstation Application Services (IWAS).andP;  IWAS is a feature of theImage Application Library Services (ALS) that is a set of workstation and LANservices that support image processing.andP;  In contrast with IHAS, whoseservices are required in total by all HPTS applications, IWAS has beendivided into three subcomponents.andP;  The purpose for this division is toprovide customers with a means of configuring workstations and LANs specificto the applications they have chosen to implement.andM;The Image Management Workstation Facility (IMWF) is a set of local areanetwork (LAN) communication services used by the HPTS applications to routeimages and coded data to and from the mainframe and to other workstations onthe LAN.andM;The Image Extended Workstation Facility (IXWF) is a set of device support andimage enhancement routines used by HPTS applications that require advancedimage workstation capabilities.andP;  These services are used by the applicationsto display (on an 8514) and print (on a 4019) gray-scale and bilevel images,compress and decompress images at the workstation, and interactively enhancethe image as it is displayed.andP;  IXWF also provides device support forlow-speed image capture and magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) codeline data capture.andM;The Image Entry Workstation Facility (IEWF) is a set of device-supportroutines that is a subset of those provided in the Image Extended WorkstationFacility (IXWF).andP;  These services are used by HPTS applications (such as keyentry) that require base image functions (such as displaying all or portionsof a bilevel image) in support of image-assisted data entry.andP;  The IEWFroutines support the display of images on medium- or high-resolution 8503 or8514 displays.andM;Image Processing Recognition Services (IPRS).andP;  This core software componentsupports image processing on the LAN for applications that require high-speedimage decompression and numeric hand-printed character recognition andmachine-print recognition (RECO).andP;  IPRS also contains memory management andimage distribution functions that send images to the workstations on the LANfor validation and viewing of the RECO results.andM;Performance considerationsandM;More than 50 billion checks are processed annually in the U.S., most of whichare processed against very tight deadlines to minimize the amount of dollarfloat charged to the financial institution.andP;  Banks have been very creative todate by implementing controls that flag high-dollar items for specialhandling, by chartering airplanes to transport the checks, and by automatingthrough the use of high-speed document processing equipment for transporting40 documents per second.andP;  Images that are of sufficient quality to performthe applications illustrated in Figure 2 must be captured at a minimum of 240pels per inch.andP;  This requirement is driven by the need to perform therecognition of unrestrained numeric hand printing as an assist to the keyingapplication.andM;The second requirement when viewing the captured image is the ability torecognized the overprinting that results from endorsements placed on adocument by machine, hand stamp, or writing.andP;  It is necessary to distinguishoverprinting from printing on the base document itself.andP;  Gray scale isrequired to provide this viewing depth.andP;  The capture operating point selectedto meet this requirement is 240 pel and 256 levels of gray, which is reducedto 80 pel and 16 levels during processing.andP;  The 240 pel and 256 levels arespecified for the initial capture to allow for intelligent processing andcommonality with the need for a 240 pels-per-inch black-and-white image.andP;  Thecheck sizes range from 6 by 2.75 inches to 8.75 by 3.67 inches, which resultsin 950 00 to 1 850 000 bytes of information generated for each side of thedocument.andP;  Because the system captures both sides of each document, thebandwidth of the data path from the scanner to the image capture processormust handle 170 megabytes per second.andP;  The goal of the system design is tominimize the amount of data, with a specific goal to fit within a 3.0megabyte channel when transmitting the processed data to the host.andP;  Severalprocessing means (filtering, separate black-and-white and gray-scalerenditions, reduced resolution and gray-scale depth, elimination ofextraneous information, and the application of a compression algorithm) areused to reduce the data.andP;  The result is images that average 42 000 byteseach, well within the capability of the 3.0 megabyte channel.andM;The images are stored on DASD on a real-time basis using IHAS to provide thefast storage and retrieval times required by the applications.andP;  Longer-termstorage is accomplished by transferring the data after processing to othermedia, such as tape or optical disk.andP;  A single reader/sorter typicallyprocesses 400 000 documents per day, requiring 17 gigabytes of storage if alldata are retained.andP;  Several reader/sorters may reside in a single processinglocation.andP;  The CPU requirements vary, depending on the current applications.andO;A black-and-white front-image-only entry system that performs keying,balancing, data preparation, work in progress (WIP) and statements requires1.4 million instructions per record per reader/sorter.andM;The image processor contains a high-capacity data link that is achannel-to-channel configuration and is capable of decompressing, windowing,and performing recognition results at a rate of 20 document images persecond.andP;  The system allows for recognition assistance via other documentsthat normally accompany a deposit, such as deposit slips, adding machinetapes, and electronic teller input.andP;  For example, in the case of addingmachine tapes, the tape image is entered into the system via a low-speedscanner, and recognition is performed on the machine printed characters.andP;  Theresults of this process are correlated with the accompanying documents forconfirmation of the character recognition performed on the documents.andO;Unrecognized documents are routed to the keying workstations via the 16 MbLAN for processing by an operator.andP;  The image processor supports an averageof ten keying workstations, each capable of processing 4000 images per hour.andM;The image qualification process is a substantial improvement overconventional processing.andP;  System productivity improvement results from thefewer items that have to be keyed and from the faster operator keying ratethat results from image.andP;  The results of the keying and recognition arecompiled and validated automatically at the workstation manager.andM;For applications not requiring the high-speed image processor, decompressionis performed in firmware at the workstation.andP;  These functions are generallyof a document-research type that do not place a heavy load on the systembecause of the comparatively long time it takes the operator to analyze theimage before an action is taken.andP;  The need for exception handling of adocument or report is met by the use of a low-speed scanner and/or a printerattached to a workstation.andP;  Multiple scanners accommodate a wide variety ofdocument sizes from adding machine tapes (2.5 inches in width and lengths ofup to 5 feet) to sheet paper of 8.5 by 13 inches.andP;  Scanning time depends onthe particular scanner being used and the mode of operation selected (blackand white or gray scale).andM;HPTS image application softwareandM;For purposes of discussion, image processing applications have been dividedinto the two groups, front-end subsystem and back-end subsystem.andP;  Thefollowing is a general description of each of the subsystems and a discussionof the application architecture framework within which all the HPTS imageapplications must fit.andM;Front-end processing subsystem.andP;  The purpose of the applications in thefront-end subsystem is to perform all the required processing on a group ofitems to facilitate movement of these items to the next bank or processingcenter.andP;  The applications that are collectively referred to as the front-endsubsystem are the following.andM;Data preparation (data prep) application.andP;  The data preparation applicationfunctions are performed on the image extended workstation between the time ofreceipt of items at the bank processing center and the time of capture andsorting on the 389X/XP.andP;  The purpose of the data preparation application isto provide for conditioning of the items and to accept item control andsource input information.andP;  The item conditioning process prepares the itemsfor high-speed processing on the 389X/XP and includes the removal of paperclips, orientation of documents, insertion of control documents, and theplacement of documents into trays or boxes for transportation to the 389X/XP.andO;The control and source data input process includes the ability to do thefollowing: (1) capture images of adding machine tapes or cash letters (usinga workstation scanner) to provide assistance data for downstream RECOprocessing balancing; (2) capture control numbers from MICR-encoded controldocuments (using a 4706-type document code-line reader); and (3) weigh thegroups of items (using a PS/2-attached weight scale).andP;  Additional informationthat can be captured in the data prep application is optionally key-enteredby the data preparation operator.andP;  Examples of the data that can be enteredby the operator are source of the items, time and date of receipt, type ofwork, and the availability schedule to be assigned to the items.andM;Key entry.andP;  The key entry application functions are performed on either theimage entry workstation (for amount key entry) or the image extendedworkstation (for reject processing) between the time of capture and sortingon the 389X/XP and processing by the balancing application.andP;  The purpose ofthe key entry application is to support high-speed keying from image of dataassociated with the items.andP;  The two categories or classes of check itemsprocessed by this application are MICR reject items from the 389X/XP andunqualified items.andP;  The term unqualified items means those items whoseamounts must be MICR-encoded on the bottom of the check.andM;Balancing.andP;  The balancing application functions are performed on the imageextended workstation.andP;  In a typial work flow, the balancing application isinvoked for a unit of work (or group of items) upon completion of capture andsorting on the 389X/XP and processing by the key entry application.andP;  Thepurpose of the balancing application, through the use of images and nonimagedata, is to provide the necessary tools to a balancing operator to balancethe dollar amount of the documents processed in HPTS to a known controlltotal.andM;Work in progress (WIP).andP;  The WIP application functions are performed on astandard PS/2 similar to the image entry workstation.andP;  Unlike other imageapplications for which there is a logical flow of items from one to the nextapplication, WIP is always running and is not a specific step within anapplication sequence.andP;  The WIP application is primarily concerned with thecurrent state of operation (or work in progress) within HPTS.andP;  The purpose ofWIP is to provide HPTS with production control, performance measurement,modeling, and forecasting information upon which bank personnel can makescheduling, personnel assignment, or other types of decisions.andM;Back-end processing subsystem.andP;  The back-end processing subsystem consistsprimarily of applications associated with handling the commercial and retailaccounts (savings, checking, etc.) of the bank itself.andP;  The applications thatare included in the back end are the following.andM;Image statements.andP;  The purpose of the image-statement application is toprovide the commercial and retail customers of the bank with the opportunityto receive printed copies of images as part of their account statement,rather than the physical documents themselves.andP;  The mainstream functions ofthe statement application are performed on the host on statement-cycle day.andO;Images that were stored on magnetic or optical media on the day of captureare retrieved.andP;  The image processor is used to decompress and window theimages, with the results printed on a mainframe printer, using advancedfunction printing (AFP) facilities.andP;  The workstation components of theapplication are performed on the image extended workstation and provide amechanism for handling exception statements and for servicing customerrequests for interim account statements.andM;Exception processing.andP;  The purpose of the exception-processing application isto handle posting system exceptions.andP;  The functions of this application areperformed on the image extended workstation and include the handling ofoverdrafts, stop payments, referrals, closed accounts, and signatureverification.andP;  The use of on-line images results in an operator throughputimprovement over existing paper-handling exception processing systems.andM;Return-item processing.andP;  The return-item processing application is the meansby which a bank handles its incoming and outgoing returns.andP;  The imageextended workstation provides image enhancement capabilities that assist indetermining the source of a deposit item.andP;  These capabilities includecontrast and pseudocolor enhancement of the endorsements.andP;  As with theexception-processing application, the return-item application results inimproved processing times through the use of images rather than physicalpaper handling.andM;Electronic kill.andP;  The electronic-kill application provides a mechanism forbanks to process incoming and outgoing electronic media.andP;  This applicationruns on the host and is the key application required for interbank truncationof physical documents.andM;HPTS application architecture frameworkandM;The ImagePlus HPTS application architecture is based on the SystemsApplication Architecture (SAA) concept of cooperative processing.andP;  As such,each HPTS application consists of at least two parts: the host application(which runs on the host processor) and the workstation application (whichruns on one of the two workstation types, depending upon the application).andM;The host application interfaces with the Check Processing Control System(CPCS) to retrieve coded data and processing instructions.andP;  The hostapplication also interfaces with IHAS to retrieve images.andP;  An AdvancedProgram-to-Program Communication (APPC) conversation between the hostapplication and the LAN-based application provides the host application withthe ability to perform background tasks associated with assembling data forprocessing on the LAN and sending those data to the LAN.andP;  This cooperativeprocessing architecture also allows the customer to maintain all thedatabases (both image and nonimage) that are required to run theitem-processing operation on a centralized mainframe computer, whiledistributing the sophisticated operator-interface functions to OS/2workstations to take advantage of the SAA Common User Access (CUA)facilities.andM;The workstation application interfaces with the operator.andP;  The functionsperformed by the workstation application are assisted byworkstation-communication or device-support services provided by either orboth the Image Entry Workstation Facility and Image Extended WorkstationFacility core software components.andM;Applications such as key entry are of a highly interactive nature and requirethat some of the workstation application functions be offloaded to a separateprocessor on the LAN.andP;  This processor is called the workstation manager, andthe application software that runs in the workstation manager station isreferred to as the application manager.andM;The application manageer monitors the processing status on the LAN.andP;  Throughthe use of the Image Management Workstation.andP;  Facility core softwareroutines, the application manager (1) determines which images and coded dataare available for processing by the workstation application; (2) determinesthe coded data have been processed and sends the data back to the hostapplication; and (3) initiates requests to the host application for morecoded and image data, when processing on the LAN is nearing completion.andP;  Therelationship between the image applications and the core image software isshown in Figure 7.andP;  This application architecture framework, together withthe previously described portions of the HPTS architecture, form the newimage platform for document processing in financial institutions for the1990s.andM;Concluding remarksandM;The IBM ImageOlus High Performance Transaction System (HPTS) was architectedand designed with the assistance of the IBM Research Division and six IBMcustomers in the financial services industry.andP;  The primary functions of HPTSare high-speed image capture, image database management, numeric hand printand machine print character recognition, and image enhancement at aworkstation.andM;The initial implementation of HPTS is aimed at check-processing customers.andO;However, all the functions provided by the system are required to supporthigh-speed image and transaction processing applications, which extend welllbeyond check processing.andP;  HPTS should be readily extendable to otherapplications that today involve high-speed processing and manual handling(data entry) from paper documents such as, remittances, tax documents,mail-order forms, census data, standarized tests, manufacturing receiving anddistribution functions, and many more.andM;Standard system architecture components (such as MVS, OAM, VSAM, DB2, OS/2,image scanners, and displays) were chosen with these needs in mind.andP;  Theimplementation of Systems Application Architecture (SAA), and particularlycooperative processing, APPC, and Common User Access (CUA), in conjunctionwith image processing technology makes HPTS a viable solution for the 1990sand beyond for many high-speed image and transaction processing needs.andM;The authors have attempted to describe the results of a project that spannedover four years in time and several hundred person years of effort.andP;  Theapplication addressed by this system, that of check processing, hadpreviously been automated via magnetic character recognition and standarddata processing hardware and software.andP;  The migration to an automated imageplatform based on standard strategic hardware and software was both naturaland required by the massive increase in the use of bank checks.andM;Future expansions of this technology will be driven by the customers'business and operational needs.andP;  We have laid the foundation for theseextensions that we expect to continue to follow the strategic systemdirection discussed in this paper.andP;  We believe that the large object content,high transaction rates, and rich image processing requirements will beginsetting the pace for the data processing strategies.andM;ImagePlus, Systems Application Architecture, SAA, MVS/ESA, System/370, andDB2 are trademarks, and OS/2, PS/2, and Micro Channel are regusteredtrademarks, of International Business Machines Corporation.andM;Intel and 80386 are registered trademarks of the Intel Corporation.andM;Cited referenceandM;[1] J.M.andP;
