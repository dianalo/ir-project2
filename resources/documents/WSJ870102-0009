GarciaStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN><TEXT>   As the champagne flowed on New Year's Eve for a final toast to 1986, many on Wall Street were probably glad it was over.    No, 1986 wasn't a big loser for the stock market. Actually, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the year up 22.58% at 1895.95. That was its fifth gain in as many years, an unprecedented feat in the postwar era.    The year started with an almost uninterrupted, giddy rise in stock prices. But it turned nightmarish by the fourth quarter, as money managers fought hard to protect their early gains and Wall Street's foundations were shaken by an insider-trading scandal that swallowed up arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky and ruined many careers.    Now, analysts and portfolio managers looking ahead are sharply divided about stock market strategy. Some are betting the economy will grow at a fast enough pace this year to bring about some substantial gains in earnings for cyclical companies. They would suggest that investors sell some defensive issues, such as food and beverage stocks, and add to their holdings such economically sensitive issues as technology stocks.    The other camp sees only sluggish growth in the year ahead, similar to the 1986 pace. These market watchers would consider holding on to the rate-sensitive issues such as bank, thrift, insurance and utility stocks, as well as some of the consumer stocks that were the early winners of last year.    The bull market, then nearly 3 1/2 years old, got yet another new lease on life last January as inflationary expectations collapsed along with oil prices. The immediate result was that interest rates plunged, the U.S. dollar fell against other major currencies and stock prices soared, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 1900 for the first time by early July. Lower interest rates have been the source of life for the bull market since August 1982.    With interest rates down and inflation under control, investors had few other attractive alternatives for their funds and poured money into the stock market during the first six months. &quot;We had a liquidity-driven bull market,&quot; says Steven Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. in New York.    But the easy ride of the first half of the year ended abruptly during the summer months when a rise in the rate of economic growth renewed concern about a rise in inflation. During the third quarter congressional deliberations over a sweeping tax overhaul, signed into law by President Reagan in October, confounded stock market investors as they tried to sort the likely winners from losers in the tax changes.    Part of the turmoil of the second half of the year also came from investors selling for tax reasons to lock in gains ahead of this year's mandated rise in the capital gains rate.    The stock market slowly recovered from a historic 86.61-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Sept. 11. Large-capitalization, blue-chip stocks led some of the closely watched market barometers to record levels last month.    Trading activity also set records last year, with the busiest session registered Dec. 19, when more than 244.6 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume on major exchanges across the country, as well as in the over-the-counter market, was a bell-ringer, with more than 70.6 billion shares traded, compared with more than 50 billion in 1985. However, despite some extremely busy sessions late in the year, average daily volume peaked in the spring, just about the same time each day's number of issues advancing and setting highs began to recede.    But for the smaller-capitalization stocks such as those traded in the over-the-counter market and the American Stock Exchange, 1986 wasn't such a good year. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index made new highs in December, the Nasdaq OTC composite index finished the year well off its high of 411.16 established July 3.    Why the lag? Analysts say there are several reasons. The growing trend among pension funds to set up portfolios patterned on the Sandamp;P 500 index draws buying away from the second-tier stocks. The mergers, restructurings, and leveraged buyouts, which boosted the price of many issues, centered on the larger-capitalization stocks. Also, the larger, better-known companies tend to have more predictable earnings, comforting for investors at a time corporate profit growth has been erratic.    Individual investors -- who tend to buy many of the smaller, less expensive issues traded in the secondary market -- continue to be net sellers of stocks, according to the Federal Reserve's flow of funds report. And many individuals who haven't fled the market are participating indirectly through mutual funds that often concentrate their investments in larger-capitalization, more heavily traded stocks.    While individuals were sellers, foreign investors turned out to be big buyers of stock last year. During the first six months of 1986, they bought more than $13.4 billion of U.S. stocks, dwarfing the previous annual high of $5.81 billion in 1981. The foreign investors were responding to the sharp decline in the U.S. dollar against European and Japanese currencies, which made the U.S. market look cheap.    For 1987, some analysts expect foreigners, especially the Japanese, to be even bigger buyers of U.S. stocks. Japan has a large pool of capital available for investment because of the country's high savings rate, and increased recent deregulation of financial markets will allow the Japanese to invest a larger amount of their funds abroad. Compared with the Japanese market, where blue-chip company shares are selling for more than 50 times the estimated 1987 per-share earnings, the U.S. market looks like a bargain.    The confidence about the outlook for cyclical stocks that surfaced last summer has waned now, and many analysts are recommending defensive issues and growth stocks instead.    Realizing that earnings might not be that robust during the early months of this year, Lulu Wang, a managing director at Equitable Capital Management Corp. in New York, says she's still holding some selected food and drug industry growth stocks in her portfolio. She's zeroing in on companies with strong cash flows that can be used to pay higher dividends or finance stock buybacks.    Picking companies that &quot;generate cash flow and use it to reward shareholders for sticking with them (is) a pretty sure way to make money&quot; in this market, Mrs. Wang says.    She says the time to start moving into more economically sensitive issues would be late in the first half of the year when most investors are expected to be worried about a lack of robust growth. At that time, Mrs. Wang says she would consider selling some of the defensive issues and starting to add some &quot;cyclical growth stocks,&quot; such as chemicals and publishers, to her portfolios.    As Robert Salomon, director of equity research at Salomon Brothers Inc. sees it, &quot;The story for 1987 will be earnings leverage.&quot; Corporate revenues might not grow dramatically, but restructuring and cost controls will allow many corporations to report higher earnings because more of those revenues will be dropping to the bottom line. He says it's not a sector-wide strategy, but a painstaking company-by-company analysis to uncover more firms like General Electric, ITT and Eastman Kodak.    Martin Sass, president of M.D. Sass Investor Services, is among the more sanguine about the prospects for economic growth. Accordingly, he's already buying such cyclical issues as airlines, truckers, chemicals, forest products, paper and some aluminum stocks for his portfolios. He notes that many of these companies have already restructured their operations so they are more efficient; many will be able to implement some price increases in 1987; and all are selling, on a price-earnings basis, at a discount to the overall stock market. To him, that represents good value.    ---                    Market Boxscores                   High     Low      Close    Change    %  DJIA            1955.57  1502.29  1895.95  +349.28  22.58  Sandamp;P 500 Index    254.00   203.49   242.17  + 30.89  14.62  NYSE Comp.       145.75   117.75   138.58  + 17.00  13.98  NASDAQ Comp.     411.16   323.01   348.83  + 23.90   7.36  Amex             285.19   241.57   263.27  + 17.14   6.96  Value Line       246.80   210.84   225.62  + 10.76   5.01   (Revised WSJ Jan. 5, 1987)   (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Dow Jones IndustrialAverage&quot; -- WSJ Jan. 5, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
