He made the comment after meeting with West German ForeignMinister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whose three-day visit to Tehran wasdominated by the hostage issue.   Larijani was refering to three Iranians who disappeared withtheir Lebanese driver in 1982 and were presumed kidnapped byChristian Phalangist gunmen. The four are widely believed to havedied. No group claimed responsibility for their kidnapping.   ``Western nations, especially the United States, have close tiesto (the Phalangists),'' Larijani told reporters. ``We want allhostages to be free, the Iranians as well, and we will work as muchas we can so that they are freed.''   He did not specify what actions Iran might take.   In remarks quoted by the official Islamic Republic News Agencyand monitored in Cyprus, Larijani also did not rule out resumingties with the United States.   ``If one day we were to resume ties with the U.S. such arelationship would certainly be on the basis of mutual respect andnon-interference in each other's affairs,'' he was quoted as saying.   Genscher has offered to act as mediator in gaining the release of14 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, believed held inLebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists, West Germangovernment sources in Bonn said.   Genscher's good contacts with Tehran throughout the Iran-Iraq warwere seen as key factors in the release of two West German hostagesheld in Lebanon.   Before ending his visit on Tuesday, Genscher told reporters heurged Iran's leaders to ``to use all possibilities towardcontributing to the release of all hostages in Lebanon.''   During his stay, Genscher held talks with Larijani, President AliKhamenei, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and other Iranianofficials.   Genscher said he raised the hostage issue in each of hisdiscussions.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidTuesday that Genscher ``is not an emissary'' of the United Statesand is not representing the U.S. government in the discussions inIran. ``He is not speaking in our behalf,'' the spokesman said.   ``Obviously we're interested to hear whatever comes up in thesetalks,'' Fitzwater said, adding that ``I'm not aware of any newhope'' for release of the American hostages.   Longest held of the 14 hostages is Terry Anderson, 41, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who waskidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.   In addition, Peter Winkler, 32, a Swiss employee of the RedCross, was abducted by three unidentified gunmen Nov. 17 in Sidon,25 miles south of Beirut. No group claimed responsibility.   Earlier Tuesday, Genscher and Velayati signed a culturalagreement designed to lead to the reopening of thegovernment-sponsored Goethe Institute in Tehran. The instituteprovides information on German culture and language instruction.   Genscher was accompanied to Iran by a 30-member delegation thatincluded West German industry leaders. One purpose of the visit wasto discuss ways to help Iran rebuild its war-ravaged economy.   West Germany is one of Iran's most important trade partners.   Iran and Iraq, who began fighting in September 1980, agreed to aUnited Nations-sponsored truce in August and have been negotiatingfor a lasting peace.</TEXT></DOC>
