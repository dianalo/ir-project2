As diagnosis techniques,the insulation deterioration diagnosis of a gas insulation switch (GIS)by detecting vibration and the partial discharge detection diagnosisby a pulse current measuring equipment are presented. As patrol techniques,the remote monitoring by an ITV camera or infrared camera is presented.The operation support system for substations based on an expert system,and its inference procedures for an accident survey are outlined as itsmain function. The developing automated planning system of the optimalfacility renewal schedule is outlined, which adopts the damage quantitycaused by equipment failure, the profitability of facility renewal andthe facility obsolescence degree. As future subjects, an advanced previewmaintenance, life diagnosis and patrol service are described. (7 figs,2 photos, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
