That is the new assessment by several leading monitors ofOPEC production. They will be reporting estimates that totalproduction in May by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries is down as much as 500,000 barrels a day or morefrom the level in April.</LP><TEXT>   Such a production trend, if it holds, could have a majorimpact on world oil markets by providing support to weakprices. It was the apparent lack of follow-up to OPEC's earlyMay pledge to trim high output that led to the price drop ofmore than $2 a barrel.   The new May estimates are only preliminary and could proveto be misleading signals for oil markets. Still, they shouldprovide OPEC with some breathing room and shrink prospects ofa runaway output race.   The estimates differ some on how much OPEC is producing.But it is agreed the major reduction so far is by SaudiArabia -- which appears to be producing slightly under itsquota of 5.4 million barrels a day -- and that there aresigns of modest cuts in both Kuwait and the United ArabEmirates, the chronic overproducers.   &quot;It's not out of the question for Kuwait, which has cutback spot sales to U.S. customers significantly, to be down200,000 barrels a day for the month to around 1.7 million,&quot;said Cristina Haus, who monitors OPEC production for EnergySecurity Analysis, a Washington-based company that tracks oilsupplies world-wide.   As a result, she has lowered the output figure she expectsto report for OPEC for May from a prior estimate of 23.5million barrels a day. Now, she said, OPEC's May productionappears to be 23 million to 23.5 million barrels a day, downfrom 23.7 million in April and more than 24 million in March.   Some other monitors of OPEC production see May outputsettling in a higher range of 23.4 million to 23.5 millionbarrels a day. But that still would mean a drop of 500,000barrels a day because they have revised upward their oldApril estimates to some 24 million.   &quot;If we see another decline of 500,000 barrels a day inJune, that will be the one million total they were lookingfor,&quot; said a European-based monitor of OPEC production.Although the exporters had stated after their early Maymeeting that they planned to reduce OPEC output a total of1.4 million barrels a day through July, several leading oilministers had suggested privately that they believed oilmarkets would be satisfied with a drop of one million.   But even though the new production indications for Maycould be a firming factor for oil prices, they still don'tend a major worry for many members of OPEC. Neither Kuwaitnor the United Arab Emirates will have yet met in fullreduction promises of 400,000 barrels a day and 200,000barrels a day, respectively. The concern is that Saudi Arabiawill retaliate by raising its output back to 5.7 millionbarrels a day.   &quot;If you take the May figures at face value,&quot; said a seniorOPEC official, &quot;only the Saudis are down significantly. Theissue is how long they will stay down.&quot;   Only last week, the kingdom may have signaled that itspatience was wearing thin. In an official governmentstatement, Hisham M. Nazer, the Saudi oil minister,reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the early May accord,noting that it had given its &quot;word of honor&quot; to market nomore oil than its official quota. He called on other OPECmembers to practice a similar production discipline.   Still, the authoritative Middle East Economic Survey,which has close contacts with the kingdom, reported yesterdaythat &quot;the Saudis aren't now planning to take any steps toreview their present {production} policy until aroundmid-June.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
