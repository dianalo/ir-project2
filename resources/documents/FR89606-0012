Summary and Disposition of Comments </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background on the Colorado Program </ITAG>On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approvedthe Colorado program. Information regarding the general background on theColorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition ofcomments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval canbe found in December 15, 1980, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(45 FR 82173). Actions taken subsequent to theapproval of the Colorado program are found at 30 CFR 906.11, 906.15, and906.30. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Submission of the Amendment </ITAG>In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(d), the Director onJune 9, 1987, notified Colorado of the changes necessary to ensure thatthe approved regulatory program was no less stringent than SMCRA and noless effective than the implementing Federal regulations with respect tothe protection of cultural and historic resources. On October 14, 1988,Colorado submitted a proposed amendment partially addressing these concerns(Administrative Record No. CO-406). The proposed amendment pertains tothe identification and protection of sites listed on or eligible for listingon the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). OSMRE announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the December 14, 1988,<T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 50244) and, in the same notice, openedthe public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearingon its substantive adequacy (Administrative Record No. CO-424). The publiccomment period closed on January 13, 1989. The public hearing, scheduledfor January 9, 1989, was not held because no one requested an opportunityto testify. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Director's Findings </ITAG>As discussed below, the Director finds, in accordance with SMCRA and 30CFR 732.15 and 732.17, that the amendment submitted by Colorado on October14, 1988, meets the requirements of, and is no less stringent and effectivethan, SMCRA and 30 CFR Chapter VII. 1. Rule 2.05.6(4)(b), Mitigation of Impacts of Mining Operations Colorado proposes to add Rule 2.05.6(4)(b) which states that the MinedLand Reclamation Division (MLRD) may require an applicant for a miningpermit to use appropriate mitigation and treatment measures to protecthistoric or archeological sites listed or eligible for listing on the NRHPas determined by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO). It alsostates that such measures may be taken after permit issuance provided theyare completed before the sites are affected by mining. The proposed rule is substantively identical to the counterpart Federalregulations at 30 CFR 780.31(b) and 784.17(b), except that Colorado proposesto add language clarifying that the SHPO will make the determination oneligibility. The cited Federal regulations do not specify who makes thedetermination on eligibility. However, the Federal regulations at 36 CFR 800.4(c), which impement Section106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, specify that the AgencyOfficial, in consultation with the SHPO, and following the Secretary'sStandards and Guidelines for Evaluation, shall apply the National RegisterCriteria to evaluate properties for NRHP eligibility.As stated in part I of this ``SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION'' section of thenotice, Colorado is a State with an approved regulatory program. In Stateswith regulatory programs approved by OSMRE, the regulatory authority issuespermits for surface coal mining operations. Accordingly, State-issued permitsare State rather than Federal undertakings, and Federal laws and rulessuch as the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act and 36CFR Part 800 do not directly apply (52 FR 4250, February 10, 1987).The provisions of 30 CFR 730.5 require State programs to be consistentwith SMCRA and rules adopted by OSMRE under SMCRA. However, they do notrequire direct State program implementation of other Federal laws suchas the National Historic Preservation Act. Thus, State programs must beno less effective than the Secretary's regulations in meeting the requirementsof SMCRA. There is no requirement in SMCRA that the approved State programbe ``no less effective than'' the requirements of the National HistoricPreservation Act (52 FR 4250).Additionally, as discussed in more detail below, the Director notes thatthe Advisory Council on Historic Preservation commented that it is appropriatefor the SHPO to have the lead role in determining eligibility of sitesfor the NRHP.With respect to the subject State program amendment, since Colorado haselected to defer to the SHPO in making determinations as to NRHP eligibility,the Director finds that proposed Rule 2.05.6(4)(b) provides for a processwhich is (1) as a practical matter, at least effective as that providedfor in 36 CFR 800.4(c), and (2) no less effective than the correspondingFederal regulations at 30 CFR 780.31(b) and 784.17(b).2. Rule 2.07.6(2)(e) (i) and (ii), Criteria for Permit Approval or DenialThis rule requires that, prior to permit approval, the MLRD find that theoperation either will not adversely affect any publicly owned park or placeslisted on the NRHP or that the operation has been jointly approved by allaffected agencies with jurisdiction over the park or place. This requirementdoes not apply to operations with valid existing rights. Colorado proposesto expand the scope of this finding to include not only places listed onthe NRHP but also those eligible for listing. Colorado also proposes toadd language clarifying that the SHPO will make the determination as towhether a site is eligible for listing.In response to OSMRE's June 9, 1987, Part 732 notification, Colorado onFebruary 16, 1988, provided OSMRE with clarification that it interpretsthe phrase ``publicly-owned park or place listed on the NRHP'' in its proposedRules 2.07.6(2)(e) (i) and (ii) to include both publicly and privately-ownedsites (Administrative Record No. CO-364). Therefore, the proposed ruleas written provides protection to both publicly and privately-owned siteslisted on or eligible for listing on the NRHP.As revised, the Colorado rule affords greater protection to historic resourcesthan does the corresponding Federal rule at 30 CFR 773.15(c)(3)(ii), whichdoes not include places eligible for listing on the NRHP.Based upon Colorado's interpretation of its rule that it affords protectionto publicly and privately-owned sites, and the revised rule that protectssites listed on and eligible for listing on the NRHP, the Director findsthat the revised rule is no less effective than its Federal counterpart.As explained in finding No. 1, Colorado's proposal to rely on the SHPOfor determinations of eligibility is also no less effective than the Federalrequirements.Furthermore, by extending the protection of this finding to sites eligiblefor listing on the NRHP, Colorado has rendered moot that portion of theJune 9, 1987, Part 732 notification requiring an amendment of the programto include a finding no less effective than that contained in 30 CFR 773.15(c)(11).The cited Federal rule requires a finding that the regulatory authorityhas taken into account the effect of the proposed permitting action onproperties listed and eligible for listing on the NRHP. Since the revisedState rule requires a finding of either no adverse impact or joint agencyapproval for operations affecting such properties, the Director finds ColoradoRule 2.07.6(2)(e) as revised to be no less effective than 30 CFR 773.15(c)(11).3. Rule 2.10.3(1)(g), Specific Information Requirements for Maps and PlansColorado Rule 2.10.3(1)(g) requires each permit applicant to submit a mapshowing the location of cultural and historic resource sites within theproposed permit and adjacent areas if they are listed on the NRHP. Coloradoproposes to revise this rule to require that this map also show those siteseligible for listing on the NRHP. Colorado also proposes to add languageclarifying that the SHPO will make the determination as to whether a siteis eligible for listing.As revised, the mapping requirements of this rule are substantively identicalto those of the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 779.24(i) and783.24(i). As explained in finding No. 1, Colorado's proposal to rely onthe SHPO for determinations of eligibility is no less effective than theapplicable Federal requirements. Therefore, the Director finds ColoradoRule 2.10.3(1)(g) to be no less effective than the counterpart Federalregulations at 30 CFR 779.24(i) and 783.24(i).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments</ITAG>OSMRE did not receive any public comments in response to its December 14,1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, and it did not hold a public hearingbecause no one requested an opportunity to provide testimony.Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at30 CFR 732.17(h)(11), OSMRE solicited comments from various Federal agencieshaving an actual or potential interest in the Colorado program. It didnot receive any substantive comments in response to this solicitation ofcomments. Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4) OSMRE also solicited commentsfrom the SHPO and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (the Council)on this cultural and historic resources proposed amendment. The Councilcommented on three aspects of the proposed amendment (Administrative RecordNo. CO-421). These comments are summarized and discussed below.First, the Council commented that it assumed that the language of Colorado'srules would be accompanied by appropriate procedures providing for theidentification of properties eligible for listing on the NRHP. In response,the Director notes that OSMRE's June 9, 1987, Part 732 notification stillrequires Colorado to amend Rule 2.04.4 to authorize Colorado MLRD to requirepermit applicants to identify and evaluate, through collection of additionalinformation, conduct of field investigations, or other appropriate analyses,important historic and archaeological resources that may be eligible forlisting on the NRHP. The Director also notes that the Colorado MLRD andthe SHPO are apparently preparing a cooperative agreement that will detailthe procedures for cultural and historic resource permitting reviews. Sincethe revision of Rule 2.04.4 and the execution of the cooperative agreementbetween the Colorado MLRD and the SHPO will address (1) the identificationand evaluation of cultural and historic resources which may be eligiblefor listing on the NRHP, and (2) the procedures to be followed during permitreview to ensure that the MLRD and the SHPO properly consider all factorsrelating to cultural and historic resources, the Director has determinedthat no further action is required with regard to this comment.Second, the Council commented that language paralleling that of Section106 of the National Historic Preservation Act would be clearer than thelanguage included in Colorado's proposed regulations. Specifically, theCouncil suggested that Colorado use the language ``included in or eligiblefor inclusion in the National Register'' in place of ``listed on or thoseplaces eligible for listing * * * on the National Register of HistoricPlaces.'' OSMRE did not require Colorado to revise its proposed rules inthe manner suggested by the Council because the Colorado language is virtuallyidentical to that contained in the counterpart Federal regulations andbecause its meaning is identical to that suggested by the Council.Third, the Council also commented that while it is appropriate, as Coloradoproposed, for the SHPO to have the lead role in determining eligibilityof sites for the National Register, leaving these decisions to the unilateraldiscretion of the SHPO could create situations in which (1) OSMRE wouldbe unable to exercise its section 106 responsibilities with respect toproperties that are in fact eligible but have been determined ineligibleby the SHPO, or (2) OSMRE would be carrying out section 106 responsibilitieswith respect to properties that are not, in fact, eligible. However, theCouncil concluded that such questions could probably be handled throughconsultation among the SHPO, OSMRE, the Keeper of the NRHP, and the Councilwithout requiring further changes in Colorado's program.In response, and for the following reasons, the Director agrees with theCouncil's conclusion that no further changes to Colorado's program arerequired. The Director notes, as previously stated, that in States suchas Colorado with regulatory programs approved by OSMRE, the State, notOSMRE, issues permits for surface coal mining operations. Accordingly,it is not appropriate for OSMRE to routinely become involved in questionsof eligibility arising from State actions, nor is such involvement andthe involvement of the Keeper of the NRHP required under the Council'sregulations at 36 CFR 800.4(c). Rather, such questions are to be determinedby the Agency Official, in consultation with the SHPO. The Director recognizesthat, under 36 CFR 800.4(c)(4), the Council and the Secretary have theright, on their own initiative, to intervene on a case-by-case basis andelevate the question of eligibility to the Secretarial level. While thisprovision is rarely invoked, the Director does not interpret the Coloradorule as foreclosing this possibility, nor does the State have the authorityto do so. Rather, the State's rules are intended to clarify routine determinationprocedures; where, as specified above, the Council or the Secretary decideto remove such decision-making authority from the SHPO, OSMRE expects thatColorado will abide by such a decision, as required by the National HistoricPreservation Act. Additionally, the Director does not interpret the Coloradorule as foreclosing the SHPO, if the SHPO so desires, from seeking theadvice of the Keeper of the NRHP in determining eligibility of sites forthe NRHP.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Director's Decision</ITAG>Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the proposed amendmentsubmitted by Colorado on October 14, 1988. The Federal regulations at 30CFR Part 906 that codify decisions concerning the Colorado program arebeing amended to implement this decision. The Director is approving therules with the provision that they be fully promulgated in a form identicalto that submitted to and reviewed by OSMRE and the public. However, theDirector may require further changes in the future as a result of Federalregulatory revisions, court decisions, and OSMRE oversight of the Coloradoprogram. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expeditethe State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring theirprograms into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay.Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Determinations</ITAG>1. Compliance with the National Environmental Policy ActThe Secretary has determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared onthis rulemaking.2. Executive Order No. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility ActOn July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMREan exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291 foraction directly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, this action is exempt from preparation of a RegulatoryImpact Analysis and regulatory review by OMB.The Secretary has determined that this rule will not have a significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule will not impose any new requirements; rather,it will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA and theFederal rules will be met by the State.3. Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the OMB pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3507.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 906</ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="6">Allen D.
