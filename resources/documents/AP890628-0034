Meanwhile, separate court-ordered talks, which union officialssay have brought no progress, were continuing for a third day today.Also today, ALPA leaders from nine other airlines were meeting inWashington to discuss ways to support the Eastern strikers.   The pilots' union Tuesday asked the National Mediation Board toreferee its dispute with Eastern, accusing the airline of refusingto schedule further negotiations as required by the federal RailwayLabor Act.   ``Despite our repeated efforts, all of the major issues are stillunresolved,'' ALPA President Henry A. Duffy said in a letterrequesting the appointment of a mediator.   But Eastern said it has balked at further negotiations under thelabor law because the other talks have been ordered by a U.S.Bankruptcy Court judge who is overseeing Eastern's affairs while itis under Chapter 11 protection from creditors.   ``We don't know what they are trying to accomplish with themediation,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said. ``We believe thatthe bankruptcy court and the examiner are better able to handlebankruptcy-related labor agreements.''   Granting of requests for mediation is routine, and in this casecould trigger an unprecedented situation _ mediation of a disputeinvolving a bankrupt airline already being struck by another one ofits unions.   Federal mediation also could result in a direct strike by ALPApilots, most of whom have honored Machinists union pickets atEastern and are considered legal sympathy strikers in the nearlyfour-month-old Machinists strike.   Nearly 300 pilots have crossed Machinists picket lines, but ALPAofficials contend most of them would refuse to work if their unionstruck Eastern. However, Eastern predicts most of the pilots willcontinue to work if a pilot strike materializes.   Airline disputes are regulated by the Railway Labor Act, whichgives the mediation board broad power to try to resolve contractdisputes. Unions cannot strike airlines or railways unless releasedfrom mediation, a situation which occurred prior to the Machinistsstrike.   Eastern last week sought bankruptcy court permission to cancelits contract with the pilots and impose changes in wages and workrules it said it needs to reorganize as a smaller carrier.   But parties involved in federal mediation are prohibited fromaltering terms of their contracts.   Mediation Board spokesman David Bushnell said he did not knowwhat impact federal mediation would have on Eastern's attempt inbankruptcy court to abrogate the pilots' contract.   Matell said Eastern officials believe the bankruptcy courtproceedings would supersede the authority of the Mediation Board.Cole said ALPA attorneys are reviewing the issue.   If a mediator declared an impasse, a 30-day cooling off periodwould begin, and after that the union would be free to strike andthe airline would be free to change provisions of existing contracts.</TEXT></DOC>
