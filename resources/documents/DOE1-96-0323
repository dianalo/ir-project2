Within about a decade, robots, automated machining centres, expertsystems, and computer-aided engineering will increase the productivityin industry and could also modify nuclear power plant construction andoperation. To survive, the nuclear company has to gain flexibility andconvert to a much broader-based market approach. The nuclear companyshould also become global in nature and involved, either directly orwith its parent corporation, in a number of functional industries ina worldwide market. Together, these trends are reshaping the competitivefactors of nuclear companies throughout developed and emerging countries.It is difficult to foresee how social concerns, regarding nuclear development,regulatory climate and international institutions may interfere. Theonly conclusion that we can reasonably draw is that, as a prerequisitefor a revival of the demand of nuclear power plants, nuclear companiesshould look for an unprecedented adaptability to remain in the marketand must be able to innovate nuclear products and systems.</TEXT></DOC>
