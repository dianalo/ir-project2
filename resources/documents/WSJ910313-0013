The charges continue the battle against disposablediapers, which have been tagged as one of the culprits in thenation's trash problem.</LP><TEXT>   New York City's consumer affairs department says Pandamp;G'sadvertisement, which appeared in TV Guide, promotes thecompany's Luvs and Pampers brands as easily compostable, butfew consumers actually have access to such compostingfacilities.   The ad shows a pile of soil-like material that was once adisposable diaper before the 90-day process began. The adstates that nearly 80% of the diaper is compostable. Theprocess needed to break down the disposable diapers is called&quot;accelerated composting,&quot; which speeds up the naturaldegrading of materials. To date, 10 communities arecomposting their trash, according to the ad.   In a letter to Pandamp;G, the consumer affairs departmentrequested that the company meet with it March 22 to discussthe violations and, presumably, to negotiate suspension ofthe advertising. The letter didn't specify what actions thedepartment could take. Under, New York law, the departmentcould fine and seek an end to the ad campaign.   In Cincinnati, a Pandamp;G spokeswoman said the companydisagrees with the allegations and doesn't believe the ad ismisleading. The ad &quot;is intended to help educate consumersabout the potential promise&quot; of municipal composting and toencourage its development, the spokeswoman said.   Pandamp;G, which controls about 50% of the U.S. disposablediaper market, has been testing new diaper materials anddisposal methods for soiled diapers. Last year, Pandamp;G said itwould spend $20 million to help develop municipal compostingprojects around the world.</TEXT></DOC>
