Dorsey said Petainer, based in Neuchatel, Switzerland, ended the license agreement because Atlanta-based Coca-Cola decided not to market its drinks in plastic cans until acceptable recycling systems are in place. Petainer asserts that a practical recycling plan already has been developed, and is talking with other soft-drink companies about further test-marketing, Dorsey said.    Dorsey, based in Chattanooga, Tenn., is a joint-venture partner in Atlanta-based Petainer Development Co., which is licensed by Petainer S.A. to develop the plastic-can technology in the U.S.    Coca-Cola, a soft drink and entertainment concern, has test-marketed the plastic can, but environmentalists have objected to the can on the ground that it is more difficult than aluminum to recycle.    A spokesman for Coca-Cola confirmed that the exclusive licensing agreement had been ended. He said the company's plastic-can project &quot;will continue in its current phase, which is the development of an appropriate recycling system.&quot; He said plastic-can technology is available from sources other than Petainer.    Dorsey has interests in plastic containers, trailers and restaurants. Other partners in Petainer Development are a unit of PLM AB of Malmo, Sweden, and a unit of Metal Box PLC of Reading, England. Petainer S.A. is itself a joint venture of PLM and Metal Box. </TEXT></DOC>
