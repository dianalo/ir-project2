In a short ceremony at the Molesworth base, 70 miles north ofLondon, members of the U.S. Air Force 303rd Tactical Mission wingwere advised: ``Mission complete.''   Reporters and photographers, including several from the Sovietnews media, were then permitted to tour the four empty bunkers thatuntil last year housed 16 operational and two spare cruise missiles.   ``To me, this is a milestone in the implementation of the INFtreaty,'' said Maj. Gen. Marcus Anderson, commander of the 3rd AirForce, referring to the arms control agreement signed by formerPresident Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   The treaty, signed in December 1987, calls for the elimination by1991 of 2,700 Soviet and U.S. land-based intermediate-range nuclearmissiles _ those with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles.   ``This was the first operational cruise missile unit to beinactivated,'' Anderson said. ``The treaty is being implemented inthe timetable that was presented.''   Anderson said the removal of the cruise missiles represented tohim ``the fact that we can successfully negotiate treaties for armsreduction.''   Molesworth was one two bases in Britain designated in 1980 toreceive a total of 160 U.S. cruise missiles, although only 16 of itsplanned 64 operational missiles had arrived before the treaty wassigned.   The other base, Greenham Common, 50 miles west of London, houses96 missiles, which are scheduled to begin leaving ``towards the endof this year,'' said British Defense Ministry spokesman Martin Helm.The base will be deactivated at an unspecified time before 1991,Helm said.   The missiles and their launchers left Molesworth betweenSeptember and November last year for Davis Montah Base in Tucson,Ariz., to be destroyed under the watch of Soviet inspectors.   The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament welcomed the removal ofcruise missiles from Molesworth, said spokeswoman Sheena Philips.``But we remain concerned about NATO's plans to bring in newgenerations'' of nuclear weapons.   Spray-painted in big red letters on a highway overpass near thebase is the slogan ``What about the nuclear warheads?''   The missile warheads, which are not covered by the treaty, remainon site, although U.S. officials have said they will be returned tothe United States eventually.   Molesworth was not closed, since 160 of the its 800 Americanairmen and women are waiting to be reassigned. And, under thetreaty, Soviet inspectors have the right to inspect the base until2001 to ensure the missiles have not returned.   Molesworth, a Royal Air Force base, is expected to remain inAmerican hands, although the British, American and NATO officialsresponsible for the decision have not announced how it will be used.The 600-acre site, a World War II bomber base, was renovated tohouse cruise missiles at a cost of $79 million.   The first cruise missiles arrived in Europe in 1983 and weredeployed at Greenham Common. The Molesworth missiles were the lastto be deployed, in November 1987.   The Soviets began removing some of their SS-20 missiles targetedat Western Europe in February 1988. The first American missiles,nine Pershing 2s, were removed Sept. 1, 1988, from a base in WestGermany.   The last of the 16 operational and four spare cruise missilesstored in Belgium left Dec. 13, making it the first Western countryto have all the required weapons withdrawn under the U.S.-Soviettreaty.   NATO was to have deployed 572 cruise and Pershing 2 missiles infive European countries.   Officials at NATO, at the U.S. Air Force's British and itsEuropean headquarters, and at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers,Europe, were unable Monday to say how many had so far been removed.</TEXT></DOC>
