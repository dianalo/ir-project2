You seem unconcerned that the FCC's action may lead to monopoly profits for ATandamp;T at the expense of the public. Certainly, workable competition, if it exists, is preferable to regulation, but only workable competition can protect the public by keeping rates at the proper level. While you and the FCC assume such competition exists, this has never been proven.    ATandamp;T's recent price decreases have not been shown to result from increased efficiency, deregulation or competition. They are largely the result of the FCC's effort to shift telephone costs from long-distance carriers to local monopoly companies through increases in subscriber line charges and separation changes. ATandamp;T's rates have been reduced reflecting these cost shifts, while the costs of local phone companies and their customers' rates have gone up. Since divestiture, in Maryland, where cost-based regulation of ATandamp;T has been abandoned, local rates have increased by about 65%, while ATandamp;T's average decrease across all mileage bands for all time periods was only 3%.    The FCC proposes a price cap model of regulation, claiming that this system will operate &quot;at a lower cost to society than our current regulatory regime.&quot; However, even the FCC admits in its &quot;Notice of Proposed Rule Making&quot; that if profit levels for ATandamp;T are set too high, this would create &quot;an umbrella to shelter competitors (MCI, Sprint) less efficient than a dominant carrier.&quot; MCI and Sprint support the FCC's initiative because they fear that if ATandamp;T's rates continue downward as costs decline, ATandamp;T's rates will be so low that MCI and Sprint will be unable to survive and compete effectively. The FCC's action is an attempt to shelter MCI and Sprint from the rigors of competition, not a move toward cost-based competition with its benefits.    Should the FCC's efforts succeed, ratepayers will not see rate reductions equal to reductions in ATandamp;T's costs since neither regulation nor competition will require these reductions. Perhaps the FCC's long-term goal is to give companies like MCI and Sprint ample breathing room so that some day they may be able to provide ATandamp;T with sufficient competition to limit ATandamp;T's rates and profits. The FCC, however, has not made the rigorous factual analysis necessary to determine whether that day has arrived or ever will.    John M. Glynn   Maryland People's Counsel   Baltimore</TEXT></DOC>
