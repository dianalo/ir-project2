(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   You will find no rough edges here, nounswept driveway, no unmowed lawn, no jail.   This retirement community and adjoining Sun City West have apopulation of 65,000 _ about the same as Galveston, Texas, orPortland, Maine, or Harrisburg, Pa. _ and are virtually crime free.   ``About the most serious thing that happens around here issomebody's golf clubs getting snatched off a golf cart parked atthe supermarket,'' said Norman Thaler. ``But any sort of violentcrime? No, none of that.''   Thaler is one of 200 deputies in the Sun City West Posse.Another 200 deputies patrol Sun City. So 400 possemen, all invehicles, all residents, all retired, all trained and dulydeputized by the Maricopa County Sheriff, patrol 23 square miles ofpristine streets, night and day. Troublemakers beware.   ``We don't arrest anybody,'' Thaler said. ``If we see somethingthat doesn't look right we phone the sheriff. What we do for themost part is keep trouble from happening.''   The residents apparently approve. In every survey they list``security'' among the main benefits Sun City offers as a place tolive out their years, especially those who came here, as many did,from a big city.   To keep trouble from happening, the possemen leave a note on theeat of every unlocked car, phone the homeowner if a garage door isleft open, generally keep watch like a cop on a beat. If they seepotential trouble afoot, an unfamiliar young person, say, they keepan eye on him.   ``Anyone who goes on vacation or takes a trip fills out a cardfor us, listing where they can be reached and who has a key totheir house, usually a neighbor,'' Thaler said. ``We check thosehomes daily, about 300 right now but about 2,000 during thevacation time from July to September.''   The posse also provides a service specifically tailored for aretirement community; the average age here is 73. If a person withAlzheimer's disease strays from home in confusion, which is notuncommon, the posse mounts a well-practiced grid search.   So far, they always get their man.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 27</NOTE></DOC>
