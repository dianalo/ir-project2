He faces nearly three years inprison.   Dr. Toms, a 35-year-old physician who was featured in a recent Wall Street Journal page one article, was due to report for a one-month call-up yesterday. He reported with his lawyer and handed in his uniform. He was charged in magistrate's court, and released with a warning to reappear on Nov. 30, when his trial will begin.    Every white South African male is required to serve a total of four years in the military. Dr. Toms has served two years. He says his refusal to do any more military service is a protest against the lack of alternatives to conscription. Currently, only universal pacifists and strict religious objectors are allowed not to serve. </TEXT></DOC>
