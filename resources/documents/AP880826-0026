In a letter to presidential candidates George Bush and MichaelDukakis, the heads of 23 scientific and engineering societiescalled for early appointment of a new White House science andtechnology adviser who will have direct access to the president.   They contended in the letter released Thursday that ``the mosturgent problems confronting the United States and the world today _ranging from the destruction of the ozone layer and the `greenhouseeffect' to the spread of AIDS and the restoration ofcompetitiveness of U.S. industry _ depend on the effectiveutilization of the nation's science and technology resources.''   ``Leadership in science and technology policy must come from theWhite House,'' they said, urging the candidates to devote ``carefulthought'' to the White House science and technology advisorystructure.   ``We believe that this structure must be strengthened and thatthe person selected to be the principal science and technologyadviser should have direct access to the president,'' the lettersaid.   It also urged that the appointment of a new science andtechnology adviser be made early, enabling the adviser to have avoice in filling sub-Cabinet level positions in federal agencieswhich deal with science and technology issues.   Spokesmen for the Bush and Dukakis campaigns said they had noimmediate comment on the letter.   The letter was released at a news conference during which ValFitch, president of the American Physical Society, said the UnitedStates was at a competitive disadvantage in the world economybecause about three-quarters of federal research and developmentmoney goes to military programs.   Fitch, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist from PrincetonUniversity, called for a return to the ``halcyon days'' of theEisenhower and Kennedy administrations, when White House scienceadvisers had enjoyed more frequent and direct access to thepresident.   Russell C. Drew, president of the Institute of Electrical andElectronics Engineers, said, ``We see the need for a much stronger,pro-active role on the part of government in building partnershipswithin the (science and engineering) community.''   ``From the engineering standpoint, we see an extremely importantrole for a vigorous science and technology adviser to thepresident, in bringing these issues to the president, being aspokesman in the councils of government, being an advocate whennecessary,'' Drew said.   Howard K. Schachman, president of the Federation of AmericanSocieties for Experimental Biology, said, ``We believe thatsolutions to many of the world's most vexing problems will need tobe sought through the biological and medical sciences in the nextdecade.   ``The president must be given the detailed knowledge that willallow him to judge the validity and implications of the latest andbest research,'' said Schachman.   William R. Graham, a former NASA official, has been serving asWhite House science adviser since June 1986. Prior to that, thepost was vacant for a six-month period following the resignation ofGeorge A. Keyworth II in December 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
