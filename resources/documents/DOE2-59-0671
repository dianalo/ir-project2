In Sweden, 9BWRs and 3 PWRs are in operation, and utilities and vendors cooperatein various PLEX activities. The incentive for the utilities to embarkon a systematic PLEX program is obvious. In this paper, two main itemsin the plant energy extension program is Sweden are described, that is,the program for increased plant availability and capacity, and the programassociated with the extension of the utilization life of components andsystems. Of course, these two items go hand in hand. The experience ofplant disturbance and other observation are provided by each utility,and are fed back to all utilities using the computer-based ERF systemof the Swedish Nuclear Training and Safety Center. The reduction of scramfrequency, the reduction of planned outage period and the up-rating ofnominal power are discussed. Many different ageing phenomena can contributeto failure, and these factors have to be studied and understood. Inspectionand record keeping, inspection and reactor internals repaier, hydrogenwater chemistry, and the life extension of electric components are mentioned.(Kako, I.).</TEXT></DOC>
