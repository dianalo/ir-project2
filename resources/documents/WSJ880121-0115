Earnings increases, some over 50%, are expected as companies begin adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board's new rule on deferred taxes. It requires that by 1989 balance sheets be adjusted to reflect reduced top tax rates of 34%, down from 46% in 1986. Changes could show up as early as 1987's fourth quarter results.    If the change had been in effect in 1986, earnings of Standard andamp; Poor's 400 companies would have been 23% higher, says Oppenheimer andamp; Co. Using estimated earnings, Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. extrapolates that adoption for 1987 would mean a 51.6% increase in AMR Corp.'s earnings, a 38% gain for Briggs andamp; Stratton Corp. and an 18% rise for American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. The gain is a one-time adjustment, so companies adopting the rule will show a big drop in earnings the next year. &quot;For the next three years earnings won't be comparable,&quot; says Pat McConnell of Bear, Stearns.    That could confuse the stock market, says Charles Kulp of Feeley andamp; Willcox, noting that footnotes get overlooked.    ELECTRONIC KEYBOARDS bite into low-end piano sales.    You don't need a piano to take piano lessons anymore. &quot;If you have a little Casio, it may be a cheap and effective way to find out if you have a kid with musical ability,&quot; says Jim Aikin of Keyboard Magazine. Escanaba, Mich., piano teacher Ruth Chown says half her students have keyboards, many in addition to pianos.    While keyboards &quot;may not sound as good as a Steinway concert grand piano,&quot; they typically sound better than a spinet piano, says Paul Rice, store manager at Sam Ash Music, New York. A good piano, he says, starts at $2,500, while a good keyboard sells for only $800. Quality keeps improving. High-end models store recorded piano notes in computer memory, making the sound &quot;startlingly real,&quot; says J.P. Lincoln of Yamaha Music Corp. They don't need tuning, and headphones allow practice without disturbing the neighbors. The number of electronic pianos shipped rose 40% in 1986, says the American Music Conference.    START-UP COMPANIES fall out of favor with venture capitalists.    More mature companies and public stock are good buys today, say venture capitalists, explaining a shift in the allocation of their assets. Later-stage deals cost 30% to 50% less than before the Oct. 19 stock-market crash, while some public stocks &quot;promise venture-like returns,&quot; says Arthur Marks of New Enterprise Associates, Baltimore. The result: less money for small start-up companies. When the initial-public-offering market is tight, &quot;there is generally some sort of shift to established companies from start-ups,&quot; says Robert Knox, of Prudential Venture Capital, New York.    But others say the decline in start-up money is part of a long-term trend. &quot;There have been easier places to make money,&quot; says Steven Roth of Aegis Funds, Lexington, Mass. His firm used to share early-stage deals with some 60 firms; now there are only a dozen in the field. Big venture firms have too much money to concentrate on start-ups, says John Baker of Alan Patricof Associates, New York.    With the public market closed, venture capitalists are conserving funds for their own portfolio companies.    SPORTS FANS will be smoke-free at Stanford University thanks to a new ban on smoking in the seats and aisles of the football stadium and major outdoor athletic facilities. Rock-concert goers may be next. The school is considering extending the ban to its amphitheater.    A LEANER DIET has margarine, butter and oil hitting the skids, says MRCA Information services. Use of margarine in 1986 was 19% lower than in 1981, while oil slipped 16% and butter fell 7%. Older people ate the most fats -- 23% more than the average.    SEVENTEEN LETTERS is the most popular length of titles for film and TV productions, says Baseline, an information service. Since 1970, 1,101 shows or films with 17-letter titles were released; 50% of all titles had between 11 and 22 letters.    COMMUTER PARKING is a growing headache for suburban towns.    Receiving 500 applications a day, Maplewood, N.J., adopts a resident-only policy for train-station lots and nearby streets. In the Philadelphia area, applicants &quot;line up at two or three in the morning for permits that go on sale at six,&quot; says Eugene Skoropowski, chief of operations planning for Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority. In Tinley Park, Ill., more than 500 people are on the waiting list for a 250-car lot that is not even built yet.    The parking crunch reflects changing suburban demographics. With 25% of the town's 16,000 people arriving since 1982, the town of Southeast, N.Y., has seen demand for parking jump from 40 cars a day to more than 600. Metra, the Chicago-area commuter rail agency, spent $10 million in each of the past six years to expand lots. It's running out of room. &quot;If we put any more lots into downtown suburban villages, there won't be any more downtown villages,&quot; says spokesman Chris Knapton.    Illegal lot parking runs rampant. SEPTA police issue at least 4,000 parking tickets a month.
