With his decisive victory in the New York primary, the Massachusetts governor has the Democratic presidential nomination in his grasp. But how he nails it down, and how skillfully he handles himself in the weeks ahead, will determine his prospects for the general election in the autumn.    As what House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho calls &quot;the inevitable candidate,&quot; Mr. Dukakis still must move to capture the remaining 1,000 or so delegates that stand between him and the nomination. Even more difficult, he must deal with the supporters and demands of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. The result is that Mr. Dukakis is at one of the critical breakpoints of the campaign.    With his New York win, Mr. Dukakis is halfway to the nomination, and the Democratic political establishment already is lining up behind him, bringing the party's nomination struggle to a conclusion in a swifter and crisper fashion than party leaders thought possible only a month ago.    By the time the polls close in California and New Jersey on June 7, the Dukakis campaign can move within striking distance of the 2,081 delegates needed for nomination; the rest could then be picked up before the Atlanta convention by winning the allegiance of uncommitted delegates.    But Mr. Dukakis still faces formidable challenges before he receives the nomination at the party's convention this July.    The first is to defeat Mr. Jackson in the remaining contests while simultaneously opening a dialogue with him so that the Democratic ticket wins Mr. Jackson's enthusiastic support, unites the party, and draws the black support that can provide the winning margin in several Southern states in November.    &quot;Jesse Jackson is still alive, and Michael Dukakis cannot forget that,&quot; says Kirk O'Donnell, who heads the Center for National Policy, a Democratic-oriented think tank. &quot;The greatest respect he can show Jackson is to take that candidacy very seriously.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis has shied away from criticizing Mr. Jackson, hoping to position himself for a rapprochement at the end of the primary season. The two men talked on the telephone yesterday, and their aides have sought to open channels between the campaigns.    The Dukakis campaign is willing to consult with Mr. Jackson on political tactics. But Dukakis aides will find it much harder to accommodate him on more sensitive and substantive matters, ranging from the budget to foreign policy. And, in private, Mr. Dukakis shows little inclination to invite Mr. Jackson to be his vice presidential running mate.    Jackson campaign manager Gerald Austin, however, is asserting that his candidate has earned a place on the ticket, particularly if Mr. Jackson defeats Mr. Dukakis in another major primary. Jackson supporters argue that any white candidate who had done as well as Mr. Jackson has would automatically rank high on any list of vice presidential possibilities. A Dukakis misstep in dealing with those demands could severely injure the ticket by alienating an important constituency and prompting new racial tensions within the party.    Gov. Dukakis, a cerebral politician who has won more votes than enthusiasm in this campaign, must select a running mate who helps him address what many voters are likely to see as his weaknesses: that he is too Eastern, too liberal, too provincial and too inexperienced, especially on national-security issues. It won't be easy to find someone who fills the bill. The selection must be acceptable to myriad elements of the Democratic coalition, many of them with contradictory interests. One natural choice, Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, might not want the job -- but if he did, he might raise real opposition from Jackson supporters.    At the same time, Mr. Dukakis must prepare a convincing case against Vice President George Bush. Even the governor's closest aides acknowledge that his campaign has failed to develop a compelling message that can be sustained throughout the fall campaign. Mr. Dukakis's successes in the nomination struggle have come in large measure because other candidates have faltered; he can't afford to hope simply that the same thing happens in November.    &quot;Dukakis has to reach the swing voter, he's got to make a real case for change and he's got to do it with some excitement.&quot; says Greg Schneiders, a Democratic political consultant. &quot;So far, he hasn't done that.&quot;    Many leading Democrats are doubtful that Mr. Dukakis will be able to accomplish that task. &quot;Anybody who thinks he's going to be fireworks on the Fourth of July is kidding himself,&quot; says Harrison Hickman, a Democratic consultant. &quot;We're going to have to be content with sparklers.&quot;    Even so, Mr. Dukakis's journey to the nomination should accelerate in the weeks ahead. He is positioned to pick up a handful of delegates in Guam and Utah, and then to win about 140 delegates next Tuesday in Pennsylvania. With the additional support of several dozen &quot;super-delegates&quot; -- primarily party leaders and members of Congress -- Mr. Dukakis will be approaching 1,300 delegates by the end of April. Winning two-thirds of the more than 800 delegates remaining to be chosen would place him around 200 delegates from the nomination.    Mr. Dukakis, who has placed first or second in 28 of the 39 states that have held contests this year, still will have to negotiate to reach 2,081. &quot;We have to win primaries,&quot; says Susan Estrich, the Dukakis campaign manager, &quot;but there are other ways to win delegates.&quot; But Mr. Dukakis faces a far easier task than even his most optimistic backers contemplated only weeks ago.    It is clear now that the party will avoid the uncertainty of a brokered convention -- primarily because of Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore's failure to crack what swiftly became a Dukakis-Jackson battle. Outside of his native South, Mr. Gore was able to win only the tiny states of Wyoming and Nevada. He has been winless since Super Tuesday and is expected to leave the race today.    Mr. Dukakis, meanwhile, is reaping the rewards of momentum. Democratic politicians all over the country are recognizing that his win in New York &quot;clearly establishes him as the front runner -- and I believe a strong one,&quot; says Michigan Democratic Chairman Richard Wiener, the president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs.    Mr. Wiener still hasn't made an endorsement, but the Dukakis campaign yesterday won the support of six congressmen in Pennsylvania, the site of the next big primary. Dukakis aides said Sally Richardson, the Democratic chairman in West Virginia, offered her endorsement contingent upon Mr. Dukakis's winning New York; she is expected to make her announcement today at the state capital in Charleston. The campaign also expects first a trickle, then a flood of endorsements from Democratic National Committee members eager to be behind the winner. &quot;He is absolutely the candidate that has demonstrated he's the most winnable.&quot; says June Fischer, a Democratic National Committee member from Scotch Plains, N.J., whose endorsement was announced yesterday.    Meanwhile, Mr. Dukakis's aides are mobilizing to win the support of other undecided delegates and party leaders. Kitty Dukakis, the candidate's wife, has been calling state party chairmen; the candidate himself telephoned 20 super-delegates the day of the New York primary and had a list of 20 more yesterday.    &quot;A number of people are going to be stimulated to move sooner than they had planned,&quot; says Rep. Vic Fazio of California. &quot;They won't wait for the convention. People in politics like to be relevant.&quot; Mr. Fazio, who had supported the candidacy of House colleague Richard Gephardt, estimated that as many as three-quarters of the super-delegates selected from Congress ultimately would back Mr. Dukakis.    House Democrats yesterday approved the selection of 207 of their colleagues to be delegates to the Atlanta convention. Thirty-seven of them have already endorsed Mr. Dukakis, 15 have said they back Mr. Jackson, 12 have come out for Mr. Gore and 10 for Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who has suspended his campaign. The remaining 133 are uncommitted, according to an Associated Press survey.    On Tuesday, Senate Democrats ratified the selection of 43 of their members to be delegates. Thirteen of them have already endorsed Gov. Dukakis, seven have declared for Sen. Gore (including the Tennessee lawmaker himself) and two for Sen. Simon -- Mr. Simon himself and his Illinois colleague Alan Dixon. The remaining 21 are uncommitted.    The Dukakis delegate search is aimed both forward and backward on the political calendar, targeting not only people like Rep. Fazio who could be helpful in the coming California primary but also those like James Reynolds, who was elected a Gephardt district delegate in the first round of the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8.    &quot;They're trying hard to tilt some of our people into the Dukakis campaign,&quot; says Mr. Reynolds, who was a Gephardt organizer in the Dubuque area. &quot;The Iowa campaign is still on, and people like me have something to bargain with. We have power way out of proportion to our political value.&quot;    So much power, in fact, that Mr. Dukakis has just opened an office in Des Moines. &quot;We're negotiating all over the place,&quot; says James Crawford, a Des Moines lawyer and a key Dukakis supporter in Iowa. &quot;We're telling some Gephardt people that if they vote with us, we'll make sure some of them get to go to the convention as Dukakis delegates. We're dealing with offers to help people get elected to the Democratic National Committee. Anything that gets an additional Dukakis delegate is worth doing.&quot;    ---                 Democratic Delegate Count                            ASSOCIATED            NBC                                 PRESS           NEWS Dukakis                      1,063.15          1,065 Jackson                        841.1             859 Gore                           421.55            426 Simon                          183.5             178 Uncommitted                    613.75            434 Needed to nominate: 2,081</TEXT></DOC>
