At that time beamtube coupling was just starting to be examined. It was found that inrestricting the number of cells to four with the correct amount of intercellcoupling, and endcells compensated simultaneously for several modes,trapped modes can be avoided at least up to three and a half times thefundamental mode frequency. This result is regarded as a sufficientlysafe basis to switch over to beam tube coupling with two higher ordermode (hom) couplers, one on each side and with 65 degrees in betweenthem, and in addition one beam tube power coupler. The characteristicsof the cavity and the machine determine the basic coupler specifications.Four designs are discussed for hom couplers. 22 reference, 15 figures,2 tables</TEXT></DOC>
