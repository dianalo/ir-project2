The performanceof two types of isolation system using friction dampers and lead sheardampers respectively was examined. The results showed that both systemsusing these hysteretic dampers could attenuate the response accelerationsof the building and limit the excessive deflexion of rubber bearings.However neither system, particularly the system using friction dampers,was less effective in reducing the response acceleration of the internalequipment.</TEXT></DOC>
