The study, by consultants Bentley Group Ltd., says that 32.5% of all insider filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are late, based on an examination of 200,000 filings by 2,000 companies from 1983 through 1987.    More than 17% of filings are at least two months late, according to Jonathan Paul Bentley, president of Bentley Group. And at several companies, more than 80% of insider reports are filed after the legal deadline. Mr. Bentley says that the situation amounts to &quot;total neglect of a law.&quot;    Many individual investors pay attention to insider actions in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold a stock. If insiders don't file their reports within the required time frame, the information becomes less valuable or even useless.    For example, the Bentley study indicates that just before the 1987 stock market crash, there were an unusually large number of sell reports filed late. Had they been reported on time, presumably some investors might have taken the hint and bailed out.    Corporate insiders -- officers, directors and major shareholders -- must report any trades in their company's stock to the SEC by the 10th of the month following the trade. For example, an insider trade made Nov. 9 must be reported by Dec. 10.    Harry Weiss, an assistant director in the SEC's enforcement division, said: &quot;The fact that these delinquencies have gotten out of hand has only been recognized recently.&quot; He said he couldn't confirm or deny the figures in the study, but added that the federal agency &quot;wouldn't be shocked&quot; to learn that nearly a third of insider filings are late.    Mr. Weiss said that in September the SEC asked Congress to give it the power to hold administrative proceedings and levy fines against late filers. Under the proposed new law, the SEC could impose fines of up to $100,000 a violation for individuals, and up to $500,000 for corporations.    In addition, Mr. Weiss said, the SEC staff will recommend that the agency seek public comment &quot;within the next couple of months&quot; on new rules of its own to deal with the late filing problem. Mr. Weiss wouldn't say what the proposed new rules might contain. But Mr. Bentley believes the SEC may seek to punish late filers by restricting their right to sell company stock for a certain period.    Many traders and investors say that the current requirement, which in some cases can give insiders up to 40 days to report a trade, is too slow, even if it were enforced. For example, an American Bar Association subcommittee has proposed that insider trades should be reported within two days of their execution.    When the filing law is broken, the SEC's main enforcement tool currently is going to court to seek an injunction against a late filer. If an injunction is issued, further violations bring contempt-of-court penalties, which can include fines or imprisonment. But Mr. Weiss says that an injunction is a &quot;howitzer&quot; that is inappropriate for use against most violations. Only &quot;egregious&quot; ones are currently pursued, he says.    In the fiscal year that ended in September, he says, the SEC obtained seven injunctions against individuals for late filing. For the previous year, it was &quot;seven or eight,&quot; and for the three previous years, a total of &quot;36 or 37.&quot; Those figures don't count violations of reporting rules that were incidental to more serious wrongdoing.    Trading by corporate insiders shouldn't be confused with the &quot;insider trading&quot; in the recent Wall Street scandals, which involved abuse of confidential or misappropriated information. Most insider trading is perfectly legal, so long as reporting requirements are observed.    Mr. Bentley, a consultant in Washington, D.C., and New Port Richey, Fla., prepared the study using the insider-trading data bank of Investnet Group Inc., which also supplies insider data to The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Bentley sells information to companies on how to comply with SEC disclosure rules, so he is not entirely disinterested.    But in his study, he seems to have taken steps to avoid exaggerating the problem. The 2,000 companies he selected include the largest 1,000 publicly traded companies (by market value) and 1,000 others where filings were relatively frequent. Thus he screened out some 8,000 smaller companies that file SEC forms rarely and might not know the rules very well.    Mr. Bentley also used a generous standard to measure lateness. Before counting a report as late, he allowed companies until the 13th of the month following the trade, or 30 days after the trade was done, whichever came later. That's a looser standard than the one specified in the law. Even so, he found that 65,000 out of 200,000 insider trades from 1983 through 1987 were reported late.    Mr. Bentley also calculated which companies most often file late, and which ones are most prompt. That calculation was made for 834 companies that were relatively large and whose insiders had filed at least 30 reports during the five-year period. The top and bottom five companies are shown in an accompanying table. At none of the 834 companies had insiders filed all their reports on time.    The study said SouthTrust Corp. was the tardiest company, with 92% of filings late. Aubrey D. Barnard, corporate secretary, said the trouble was &quot;a mechanical problem that we have since corrected,&quot; involving small monthly purchases under dividend reinvestment and employee stock ownership plans. The company first learned of the problem in January of this year, he said, when it received warning letters from the SEC.    A spokesman for Winn-Dixie Stores Inc., whose insiders were said to have filed late 84% of the time, said: &quot;There's no way that we can confirm the figures; we just don't know. But we have had some late filings. The returns are complicated. Steps are being taken to make our filings more prompt.&quot;    A spokesman for Federal Paper Board Co., whose insiders were said to have filed late 85% of the time, declined to comment.    Officials of Pep Boys-Manny Moe andamp; Jack, whose insiders were said to have filed late 88% of the time, didn't return calls seeking comment.    At International Lease Finance Corp., which ranked second on the list with 91% of filings said to be late, a spokesman and an attorney said that any late filing problem that may have occurred from 1983 through 1987 has eased recently. They said that in any case &quot;nobody was damaged&quot; because the three founders who own more than 60% of the stock haven't sold any shares since the company went public in 1983.    ---   ALL THAT GLITTERS: A vein of insider selling has been visible at some gold mining companies in recent weeks.    At Echo Bay Mines Ltd., in Edmonton, Alberta, five insiders have sold some shares in the past eight weeks and none has bought. A company spokesman said three of the five sold to finance houses. He also said the company's policy is &quot;to pay average salaries and more than generous stock options.&quot; He noted that all five sellers still have substantial stock options.    At Homestake Mining Co., William G. Langston, general counsel, sold 2,000 shares in June and 7,456 shares last month for $15 to $16.50 a share; he has none left. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Homestake closed at $14.125 a share. Neither Mr. Langston nor a company spokesman could be reached for comment.    At Lac Minerals Ltd., another Canadian mining company, James M. Gibbs, vice president of development, sold 35,000 shares last month and has 11,285 shares left. He said he feared that rising interest rates would raise the expense of a loan he used to acquire the shares. &quot;I don't want to be tied to a bank loan for that amount of money with sliding interest rates,&quot; he said. The sale price was just below yesterday's Big Board closing price of $10.125 a share.    ---                   Who's Fast, Who's Slow    Companies with the highest and lowest percentages of late insider-transaction filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission between 1983 and 1987, according to a study by Bentley Group Ltd.
