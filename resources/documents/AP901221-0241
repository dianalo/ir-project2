Publishing Assets</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The partnership K-III Holdings said Friday ithas agreed to acquire the ``Weekly Reader,'' Funk andamp; Wagnallsencyclopedias and other publishing operations from theprivately-held Field Corp.   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but one source familiarwith the transaction said the price was about $200 million.   K-III Holdings is a New York-based investment partnership headedby several former executives of the publishing giant Macmillan Inc.and backed by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   The partnership already has interests in educational publishing,trade magazines and directories for the transportation industry.   The deal would more than double the size of its operations, asthe assets being acquired generated revenue estimated at nearly$300 million this year compared with K-III's operations with about$230 million in revenue.   Field Corp., based in Chicago, is owned by Marshall Field V andthe Field family trusts. It put its publishing operations up forsale last summer, reportedly because it was dissatisfied with itsreturn on the operations.   The source who spoke on condition that he not be identified saidthere were believed to be a number of companies interested in partsof the operation being sold but far fewer were interested in all ofthem.   He said Field has been talking exclusively with K-III Holdingsfor the past six weeks.   K-III has agreed to buy the assets of Field Publications LP,which include the ``Weekly Reader,'' a current events publicationthat reaches more than 8.5 million elementary school children and700,000 teachers with information designed for use in theclassroom.   Field Publications, based in Middletown, Conn., is the largestU.S. marketer of children's book clubs and other programs suppliedregularly through the mail.   K-III's Newbridge Communications business already marketseducational materials through book clubs and other direct marketingprograms to more than 400,000 teachers.   Funk andamp; Wagnalls, based in Ramsey, N.J., publishes encyclopediasfor children and markets them primarily through supermarkets.   ``These busineses offer a strategic fit with the educationalfocus'' of Newbridge, said William F. O'Reilly, chairman and chiefexecutive of K-III Holdings. ``This is one of those rareopportunities where there is a real compatibility with existingoperations.''   K-III Holdings President Charles McCurdy said no sunstantialchanges are planned at either company in terms of product ormanagement.   The deal is expected to be completed in early 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
