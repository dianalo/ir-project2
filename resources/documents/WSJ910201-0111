The amount of crude oil shipped into the U.S. from abroadlast week averaged some 900,000 barrels a day, about 15% lessthan in the year-earlier week, according to the latestreports from both the Department of Energy and the AmericanPetroleum Institute.</LP><TEXT>   Although oil industry officials insist it's likely only ashort-term reversal of a longterm trend of rising imports,this apparent slackening of the U.S. thirst for foreign oilis hardly a one-week aberration. Nor is it a result ofshortages. Supplies are ample and oil is moving from theMideast. Saudi Arabia is, in fact, providing more oil thanever to the U.S.   But for several reasons, including a significant drop inU.S. oil use, total petroleum imports have been coming downsince Iraq triggered a crisis by invading Kuwait.   In the 13 weeks leading up to the Aug. 2 invasion, theU.S. imported 6.1 million barrels of crude oil a day onaverage, according to computations by Pegasus EconometricGroup. Since then, in the 25 weeks ended Jan. 25, crudeimports averaged 5.5 million barrels a day, the Hoboken,N.J., firm reports.   The U.S. also imports petroleum products such as gasolineand distillates, including heating oil, although in smallerquantities. And these, too, are declining.   Robert Boslego, a Winchester, Mass., consultant, maintainsa running analysis of oil statistics reported weekly by theAmerican Petroleum Institute, or API. He finds that totalpetroleum imports over the most recent four-week periodaveraged 6.9 million barrels a day. That is 21% below thetotal volumes of imported crude oil and products in the likeyear-earlier period.   What is happening here? &quot;The economic reason,&quot; says Mr.Boslego, &quot;is that other buyers are outbidding U.S. buyers,and crude and products are being diverted to, or kept in,Europe.&quot;   The U.S. is the world's No. 1 oil user. Its consumptionand import trends often set patterns for the oil industryworldwide.   Last year, for the first time in seven years, U.S. oil usedeclined 2.1% to 17 million barrels a day because of aslowing economy, higher petroleum prices and mild winterweather.   But U.S. oil imports, after rising 60% between 1985 and1989, held steady in 1990 at some eight million barrels aday, or about 47% of domestic demand. Near-record imports inthe first seven months of 1990, averaging more than 50% ofdemand, masked sharp declines that began in August.   World oil supplies may not have dropped proportionately,however. Except for losses of embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti oillater made up by other members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, the world's crude output hasremained relatively high.   Indeed, many industry observers perceive an oil glut.According to recent reports of the International EnergyAgency, inventories of the major oil-consuming nations are atthe highest levels in years.   So-called producer stocks -- inventories of oil still inthe hands of OPEC members -- also are being kept high,perhaps on purpose in case of further disruptions from theMiddle East war. Saudi Arabia confirms it has 50 millionbarrels of unsold oil, mostly in tankers outside the PersianGulf. Iran may have as much, including onshore storage.   But some oil analysts say signs of the supply overhanghave yet to reach the shores of the U.S. &quot;The data&quot; for theU.S. &quot;continue to reflect an increasingly lean picture, forproducts as well as crude oil,&quot; says William H. Brown III,international oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.   Mr. Brown sees this as a deliberate maneuver by U.S.refiners. &quot;Crisis or not, there is a general orientation inthe companies to minimize holding costs,&quot; he says.   Refining experts such as Thomas Manning, a vice presidentof the consulting firm Purvin andamp; Gertz Inc., say oil importsare declining because U.S. refiners are reluctant to get intoa bidding war with their European counterparts. Mr. Manningalso cites reduced demand for fuels in the U.S. and notesthat the decline in domestic oil output has slowed.   In addition, many refiners expect to be able to tap thegovernment's strategic petroleum reserve if supplies becometight because of the Mideast war. Most look for prices ofcrude to fall further. With patience, they expect to buy itcheaper later.   Whatever the reason for importing less oil, the nation'spetroleum refiners &quot;have been living out of stocks since theKuwait invasion,&quot; says Peter Beutel, who heads the energygroup at Pegasus Econometric. On July 27, he says, U.S. oilcompanies had 386.6 million barrels of crude in inventory.Such stocks have come down more than 62 million barrels tothe recent four-week range of between 321 million and 324million, their lowest level since April 1989.   Oil use also has declined as U.S. refiners' operatingrates have fallen to around 82% of capacity, compared with88% a year earlier. This has meant declines in inventories ofgasoline and distillates, including heating oil, which nowhave fallen below year-ago levels.   &quot;The inventories are well within a normal range, but theycertainly are not excessive,&quot; says Edward Murphy, the API'sdirector of statistics.</TEXT></DOC>
