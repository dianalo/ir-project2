Davis presentedhis credentials Thursday as U.S. ambassador to Poland, ending afive-year period in which Washington had no top-ranked envoy herefollowing the imposition of martial law.   Davis, who had been serving as charge d'affaires in Warsaw,formally became ambassador at a ceremony at the government'sBelvedere Palace, where he was received by Kazimierz Barcikowski,vice-president of the Council of State.   Reviewing relations with Poland prior to the ceremony, Davisapplauded Polish steps toward economic and political reform andexpressed hope for further progress in the area of human rights.   The situation between the two countries has been ``unnaturallystrained,'' in recent years, he said.   The United States placed economic sanctions on Poland after theDec. 13, 1981, imposition of martial law and the suppression of theSolidarity independent trade union.   Soon after martial law, the Polish ambassador to Washingtondefected and was not replaced. The former U.S. ambassador, FrancisMeehan, completed his tour in 1983 and Poland rejected the U.S.nominee to succeed him.   But following the release of political prisoners in 1986 and thelifting of the last of the U.S. sanctions last year, relationsgradually warmed, culminating in the September visit of VicePresident George Bush, who was allowed to address the Polish peopleon national television.   During his visit, Bush announced that the two countries hadagreed to exchange ambassadors.   ``Fortunately Poland proclaimed a policy of nationalreconciliation and reform and that has changed the picture here asit's been implemented slowly,'' Davis said in a meeting March 11with journalists.   ``We certainly find ourselves today in a position to supportPolish efforts for economic reform and political reform, and toapplaud the steps they have taken,'' he said. ``We retain ourinterest in human rights and hope that progress in this fieldcontinues.''   Davis said the U.S. economic sanctions were designed to persuadethe government to lift martial law, release political prisoners andresume the dialogue with Solidarity.   ``By and large I think those objectives were achieved. I don'tattribute that to the sanctions however, (but to) the decisionsmade by the Polish government itself,'' he said.   Solidarity remains outlawed and Davis said the government stillhas not invited the opposition as a group to participate innational decision-making, although overtures have been made to someindividuals.   Nevertheless, Davis said, ``The ideals of Solidarity are verymuch alive and many of the objectives of Solidarity have beenobtained.''   The group is ``far from dead. It's remarkably lively consideringthe length of time that has gone by and the difficulties ofcommunicating,'' he said.   On the day Davis presented his credentials, police around thecountry issued warnings to members of Solidarity's NationalExecutive Commission that they may be imprisoned if they persist inopposition activities.   The ambassador said a meeting between Solidarity leader LechWalesa and Wojciech Jaruzelski, president and first secretary ofthe Polish United Workers (Communist) Party would be of``tremendous symbolic value, not only here but abroad.''   He said he hoped the government would consider the possibility,because it would aid its efforts to enlist broader public supportfor its reform program.   But he praised the progress Poland has made in other areas. Hecited recent publication of an interview by Solidarity adviserBronislaw Geremek, the end to jamming of Western radioPolish-language broadcasts Jan. 1, and relaxation of censorship toan extent that in domestic affairs it is ``almost non-existent.''</TEXT></DOC>
