This can be obtained by      reacting </PAL><PA0>  a) polycarboxylic acids or anhydrides thereof, if appropriate together with      monocarboxylic acids, </PA0><PA0>  b) polyols, if appropriate together with monools, and, if appropriate </PA0><PA0>  c) further modifying components, and, if appropriate, </PA0><PA0>  d) a component which is capable of reacting with the reaction product from      a), b) and, if appropriate, c), with the proviso that the final product      contains tertiary amino groups which originate from components a) and/or      b) and/or d), and the reaction product from a), b), if appropriate c) and      if appropriate d) and an acid number from 5 to 200, preferably 10 to 130,      and an amine number from 3 to 150, preferably 10 to 300. </PA0><PAL>  The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the      polycondensation and/or process product, and to coating agents based on      the polycondensation and/or addition product, a process for the      preparation of the coating agents, and the use thereof for automobile      refinishing of automobile bodies and as a topcoat, filler, varnish, primer      or undercoat. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAR>  The present invention relates to polycondensation and/or addition products      containing carboxyl groups and amino groups, coating agents based on these      polycondensation and/or addition products containing carboxyl groups and      amino groups, and the use thereof. </PAR><PAR>  It is known that compounds which contain an epoxy ring react with compounds      containing carboxyl groups, with ring opening. When compounds containing      more than one epoxy group and more than one carboxyl group are used, the      reaction proceeds with formation of polymeric esters which contain      secondary hydroxyl groups. This polymer formation is known under the term      &quot;acid-curing epoxy resins&quot;. </PAR><PAR>  It is known that this epoxy-carboxy reaction can be catalyzed by suitable      basic compounds. Suitable basic catalysts are, for example,      diazabicyclooctane, diazabicyclononene, diazabicycloundecene, imidazole      derivatives, such as 3-methyl-, phenyl- or cyclohexylimidazole,      trialkylamines, such as triethyl-, tributyl- or tricyclohexyl-amine,      N,N'-dialkylpiperazines, trialkyl- or triaryl-phosphines, hydroxides,      carbonates and salts of organic acids of the alkali metals, such as      lithium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium benzoate and lithium      benzoate. Further suitable catalysts are chelates of magnesium, aluminum      and titanium. </PAR><PAR>  EP-B-2,284 discloses a reactive, curable polymer mixture based on epoxy      compounds and polycarboxylic acid units. By using polycarboxylic acids      which are modified with primary amino groups, polycarboxylic acid units      containing primary amino groups are obtained. The disadvantage in this      case is the danger of gelling. In order to achieve low curing temperatures      and short curing times, external catalysts are necessary. </PAR><PAR>  EP-B-51,275 discloses a reactive, curable binder mixture based on epoxy      compounds, polycarboxylic acid units based on polymerization and/or      condensation products, and a catalyst component in the form of alkali      metal and alkaline-earth metal salts of a polycarboxylic acid unit. The      mixtures cure completely at room temperature or at slightly elevated      temperature and can be used, in particular, for metal-effect paintwork. In      this case, the curing catalyst is incorporated into the binder in the form      of an alkali metal salt or an alkaline-earth metal salt. Although an      internal catalyst is. involved in this case, incompatibility problems may      occur. </PAR><PAR>  EP-B-5,868 discloses a water-soluble reactive binder which can be obtained      from cyclic polycarboxylic acid compounds, salt-forming substances, such      as, for example organic bases, polymers containing hydroxyl groups, and      epoxy compounds. The individual binder components can be present in      chemically bound form. The mixtures cure at room temperature, and they are      preferably used in the form of their aqueous solutions. Organic bases,      such as, for example, tertiary amino compounds, cause the water-solubility      of the binder system. In order to accelerate curing of the binder mixture,      an external catalyst must be used, which is associated with severe      problems with respect to compatibility. </PAR><PAR>  The object of the present invention was to provide a coating agent based on      acid-curing epoxy resins, where complete curing of the coating agent      should occur at a sufficiently high rate and at the lowest possible      temperatures. The films produced should have good or even improved      properties in respect of hardness and elasticity. It should be possible to      omit the use of an external catalyst in order to avoid incompatibility      problems. </PAR><PAR>  The invention relates to a polycondensation and/ or addition product      containing carboxyl groups and amino groups, which can be obtained by      reaction of </PAR><PA1>  a) polycarboxylic acids or anhydrides thereof, if appropriate together with      monocarboxylic acids, </PA1><PA1>  b) polyols, if appropriate together with monools, and, if appropriate, </PA1><PA1>  c) further modifying components, and, if appropriate, </PA1><PA1>  d) a component which is capable of reacting with the reaction products from      a), b) and, if appropriate, c), </PA1><PAL>  with the proviso that the final product contains tertiary amino groups      which originate from component a) and/or b) and/or d), and the reaction      product from a), b), if appropriate c) and if appropriate d) has an acid      number from 5 to 200, preferably 10 to 130, and an amine number from 3 to      150, preferably 10 to 100. </PAL><PAR>  Suitable polycarboxylic acids (component a) are, for example, phthalic      acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, halophthalic acids, such as      tetrachloroor tetrabromo-phthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid, adipic      acid, sebacic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid,      endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic acid, trimellitic acid, and anhydrides of      the acids mentioned, where these exist. </PAR><PAR>  Monocarboxylic acids, such as, for example, benzoic acid,      tert.-butylbenzoic acid, lauric acid, isononanoic acid, and fatty acids of      naturally occurring oils, may also be employed, if appropriate, together      with the polycarboxylic acids. </PAR><PAR>  Suitable alcohol components b) are polyhydric alcohols, such as ethylene      glycol, propanediols, butanediols, pentanediols, hexanediols, neopentyl      glycol, diethylene glycol, cyclohexanedimethanol, trimethylpentanediol,      ditrimethylolpropane, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, glycerol,      pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, trishydroxyethyl isocyanurate,      polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, if appropriate together with      monohydric alcohols, such as, for example, butanol, octanol, lauryl      alcohol or ethoxylated or propoxylated phenols. </PAR><PAR>  As component a) (carboxylic acid component), aminocarboxylic acids      containing at least one tertiary amino group may be used inter alia or      exclusively. Examples of these are: pyridine-2-carboxylic acid,      pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, pyridine-4-carboxylic acid,      dimethylaminobenzoic acid and pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid. In this      case, nicotinic acid, i.e. pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, is preferably used,      since this is a very reactive aminocarboxylic acid with respect to      catalyzing the acid/epoxy reaction. </PAR><PAR>  As component a), the product of the reaction of an amino alcohol containing      at least one tertiary amino group with a polycarboxylic anhydride can      advantageously be used. The product of the reaction of      2-hydroxyethylpyridine with phthalic anhydride may be mentioned as an      example of such a reaction product. </PAR><PAR>  As component a), the product of the reaction of a polyamine containing at      least one tertiary and at least one primary or secondary amino group with      a polycarboxylic anhydride is preferably used. </PAR><PAR>  As the alcohol component b), amino alcohols containing at least one      tertiary amino group may be used inter alia or, alternatively,      exclusively. Examples of such amino alcohols which may be mentioned are      2-hydroxyethylpyridine and dimethylaminopropanol. As the alcohol component      b), products of the reaction of epoxy resins with carboxylic acids and/or      amines are preferably employed. </PAR><PAR>  As the modifying component c), polyisocyanates and/or diepoxide compounds,      if appropriate also monoisocyanates and/or monoepoxide compounds, are      preferably used. Suitable polyisocyanates are, for example, the toluylene      diisocyanates, hexamethylene diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate.      Diepoxide compounds are taken to mean epoxy resins containing on average      about two epoxide groups per molecule. Suitable monoepoxide compounds are,      for example, olefin oxides, such as octylene oxide, butyl glycidyl ether,      allyl glycidyl ether, phenyl glycidyl ether, p-butylphenol glycidyl ether,      cresyl glycidyl ether, styryl oxide, glycidyl methacrylate,      vinylcyclohexene monoxide, dipentene monoxide, .alpha.-pinene oxide and      glycidyl esters of tertiary carboxylic acids. </PAR><PAR>  It is particularly advantageous when, as the alcohol component b), the      product of the reaction of low-molecular-weight epoxy resins with      polycarboxylic acids and/or polycarboxylic anhydrides and aminocarboxylic      acids containing at least one tertiary amino group and/or polyamines      containing at least one tertiary and at least one primary or secondary      amino group is used, esterification subsequently being carried out, if      appropriate, with the acid and the alcohol component and modification, if      appropriate, with polyisocyanates. Low-molecular-weight epoxy resins are      taken to mean epoxy resins having a molecular weight of below about 2000. </PAR><PAR>  As component d) which is capable of reacting with the reaction product from      a), b) and, if appropriate, c), monoisocyanates containing at least one      tertiary amino group are preferably used. These can be prepared, for      example, by reacting suitable diisocyanates, such as isophorone      diisocyanate, with aminoalcohols containing a tertiary amino group, such      as, for example, hydroxyethylpyridine or dimethylaminoethanol, or with      polyamines containing at least one tertiary and at least one secondary or      primary amino group. The monoisocyanates are bound to the binder system by      reaction with free hydroxyl groups of the polycondensation and/or addition      product, with formation of a urethane bond. </PAR><PAR>  As component d), polyamines containing at least one tertiary and at least      one primary or secondary amino group are advantageously used.      Dimethylaminopropylmethylamine may be mentioned as an example of such      polyamines. </PAR><PAR>  As the alcohol component, the product of the ring-opening of epoxy resins      using hydrogen-active compounds can also preferably be used. Thus, for      example, diepoxides, such as the known Epikote types, can firstly be      reacted in steps with dicarboxylic acids, such as, for example,      pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, to form a precursor, which is then further      employed as the alcohol component. </PAR><PAR>  It is in any case essential to the invention that the final product      obtained has an acid number in the range from 5 to 200 and an amine number      in the range from 3 to 150. </PAR><PAR>  It is preferred when the polycondensation and/or addition product is      obtainable from </PAR><PA1>  a) polycarboxylic acids or anhydrides thereof, if appropriate together with      monocarboxylic acids, </PA1><PA1>  b) polyols, if appropriate together with monools, components a) and/or b)      containing ethylenically unsaturated double bonds, </PA1><PA1>  c) if appropriate further modifying components, and </PA1><PA1>  d) mercapto compounds containing at least one tertiary amino group, </PA1><PAL>  with the proviso that the product contains tertiary amino groups which      originate essentially or entirely from component d). As component a) in      this case, maleic anhydride or unsaturated fatty acids, for example, are      used; an unsaturated alcohol which is suitable as component b) is, for      example, 1,4-butenediol. In this case, the mercapto groups of the      aminomercaptan containing a tertiary amino group add to the double bonds      which are introduced into the binder by means of component a) and/ or b). </PAL><PAR>  The polycondensation and/or addition products according to the invention      are preferably obtainable by reacting a relatively high-molecular-weight      epoxy resin containing on average at least three epoxy groups per molecule      with polycarboxylic acids and/or polycarboxylic anhydrides and with an      aminocarboxylic acid containing at least one tertiary amino group and/or      polyamines containing at least one tertiary and at least one primary or      secondary amino group. As relatively high-molecular-weight epoxy resins      containing on average at least three epoxy groups per molecule, epoxidized      novolaks can be employed, for example. These are formed by reacting      novolaks with epichlorohydrin. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of a      polycondensation and/or addition product containing carboxyl groups and      amino groups, wherein the reaction of </PAR><PA1>  a) polycarboxylic acids or anhydrides thereof, if appropriate together with      monocarboxylic acids, </PA1><PA1>  b) polyols, if appropriate together with monools, and, if appropriate, </PA1><PA1>  c) further modified components, and, if appropriate, </PA1><PA1>  d) a component which is capable of reacting with the reaction product from      a), b) and, if appropriate, c), </PA1><PAL>  is carried out simultaneously or stepwise by means of esterification and/or      transesterification and/or addition reactions, with the proviso that the      final product contains tertiary amino groups which originate from      component a) and/or b) and/or d), and the reaction product from a), b), if      appropriate c) and if appropriate d) has an acid number from 5 to 200,      preferably 10 to 130, and an amine number from 3 to 150, preferably 10 to      100. </PAL><PAR>  Suitable compounds of component a) are phthalic acid, isophthalic acid,      terephthalic acid, halophthalic acids, such as tetrachloro- or      tetrabromophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid, adipic acid, sebacic      acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic acid,      trimellitic acid, and anhydrides of the acids mentioned, if these exist.      Suitable monocarboxylic acids which can be employed together with the      polycarboxylic acids are, for example, benzoic acid, tert.-butylbenzoic      acid, lauric acid, isononanoic acid and fatty acids of naturally occurring      oils. </PAR><PAR>  Suitable alcohol components (b) are polyhydric alcohols, such as ethylene      glycol, propanedio , butanediols, pentanediols, hexanediols, neopentyl      glycol, diethylene glycol, cyclohexanedimethanol, trimethylpentanediol,      ditrimethylolpropane, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, glycerol,      pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol or trishydroxyethyl isocyanurate, if      appropriate together with monohydric alcohols, such as, for example,      butanol, octanol, lauryl alcohol and ethoxylated or propoxylated phenols. </PAR><PAR>  As the carboxylic acid component a), aminocarboxylic acids containing at      least one tertiary amino group can be used, inter alia or exclusively. In      this case, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid, i.e. nicotinic acid, is preferably      used. The product of the reaction of an aminoalcohol containing at least      one tertiary amino group with a polycarboxylic anhydride is also suitable      as the carboxylic acid component a). The product of the reaction of      2-hydroxyethylpyridine with phthalic anhydride may be mentioned as an      example of such products. </PAR><PAR>  It is particularly advantageous when the acid component used is the product      of the reaction of a polyamine containing at least one tertiary and at      least one primary or secondary amino group with a polycarboxylic      anhydride. </PAR><PAR>  The tertiary amino group can also be introduced into the binder through the      alcohol component b), for example. In this case, an aminoalcohol      containing at least one tertiary amino group is employed as component b).      Examples of amino alcohols containing at least one tertiary amino group      are 2-hydroxyethylpyridine and dimethylaminopropanol. </PAR><PAR>  According to the process according to the invention, a product of the      reaction of epoxy resins with carboxylic acids and/or amines can be used      as the alcohol component b). </PAR><PAR>  It is preferred when polyisocyanates and/or diepoxide compounds, if      appropriate also monoisocyanates and/or monoepoxide compounds, are      employed as the modifying component c). </PAR><PAR>  A preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention comprises      using the product of the reaction of low-molecular weight epoxy resins      with polycarboxylic acids and/or polycarboxylic anhydrides and      aminocarboxylic acids containing at least one tertiary amino group and/or      polyamines containing at least one tertiary and at least one primary or      secondary amino group as component b), esterification subsequently being      carried out, if appropriate, with components a) and b) and modification,      if appropriate, with polyisocyanates. </PAR><PAR>  When epoxy resins are used, low-chlorine types should be employed since,      otherwise, strong discoloration of the products can occur. </PAR><PAR>  As component d), a monoisocyanate containing at least one tertiary amino      group is preferably used. This can be prepared, for example, by reacting      diisocyanates, such as, for example, isophorone diisocyanate, with      aminoalcohols containing a tertiary amino group, such as, for example,      hydroxyethylpyridine or dimethylaminoethanol, or with polyamines      containing at least one tertiary and at least one secondary or primary      amino group.

Examples of suitable epoxy resins are products of the      condensation of epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A, for example      cycloaliphatic bisepoxides, epoxidized polybutadienes, which are produced      by reacting commercially available polybutadiene oils with peracids or      organic acid/H.sub.2 O.sub.2 mixtures, epoxidation products of naturally      occurring fats, oils, fatty acid derivatives, modified oils, novolaks      containing epoxy groups, glycidyl ethers of a polyhydric alcohol, for      example ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, glycerol polyglycidyl ether,      sorbitol polyglycidyl ether, trimethylolpropane polyglycidyl ether and      pentaerythritol polyglycidyl ether, and suitable acrylate resins      containing oxirane side groups. Furthermore, the crosslinking agents can      advantageously also be products of the reaction of polyepoxides containing      hydroxyl groups with di- or polyisocyanates, as are produced, for example,      by reacting OH-functional epoxides, such as, for example, sorbitol      polyglycidyl ethers, with isophorone diisocyanate. </PAR><PAR>  Suitable solvents are, for example, toluene, xylene, butanol, ethyl      acetate, butyl acetate, pentyl acetate, dimethyl glutarate, dimethyl      succinate, 1-methoxy-2 propyl acetate, 2-ethylhexanol, ethylene glycol      diacetate, ethylene glycol monoethyl and monobutyl ether or the acetates      thereof, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether,      naphthas containing aromatics, cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketone,      acetone, butyl acetoxyglycolate and ethyl acetoxyglycolate. Suitable      additives and auxiliaries are, for example, fillers, such as, for example,      talcum, mica, kaolin, chalk, quartz sand, asbestos powder, barium sulfate,      silicates, glass fibers, sedimentation inhibitors such as, for example,      finely divided silica, bentonite, colloidal silicates and the like. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the      abovementioned coating agents, wherein the polycondensation and/or      addition product, prepared by the process described above, the epoxy resin      containing on average more than one epoxy group per molecule, and organic      solvents, conventional additives and auxiliaries and, if appropriate,      pigments are processed by mixing and, if appropriate, dispersing to form a      coating composition, the ratio of the free carboxyl groups in the      polycondensation and/or addition product to the number of epoxy groups in      the epoxy resin being in the range 1:5 to 5:1. </PAR><PAR>  The coating agents according to the invention can be applied to a very wide      variety of substrates. Suitable substrates are, for example, metals, such      as iron, zinc, titanium, copper, aluminum, steel, brass, bronze, magnesium      or the like, and furthermore ceramics, wood, glass, concrete and plastics. </PAR><PAR>  The coating agents according to the invention cure at relatively low      temperature, i.e. at room temperature or at slightly elevated      temperatures. The low curing temperature and the short curing time can be      attributed to the presence of an internal catalyst in the binder system.      If short curing times and low curing temperatures are desired, a      polycondensation and/or addition product having a relatively high amine      number is employed. </PAR><PAR>  By suitable choice of the alcohol component, the acid component and the      modifying components, the properties of the final product in respect of      hardness, elasticity and reactivity can be controlled in an excellent      fashion. </PAR><PAR>  Aromatic acid components lead to products having relatively great hardness,      whereas cycloaliphatic or aliphatic acid components lead to relatively      elastic films. </PAR><PAR>  By using suitable monocarboxylic acids, the hardness and elasticity can      likewise be influenced. Relatively hard films are obtained when benzoic      acid is used, whereas essentially softer films are obtained when fatty      acids are used. The use of hexanediols as the alcohol components leads to      elastic films, whereas, in contrast, the use of neopentyl glycol and      pentaerythritol leads to relatively hard coatings. </PAR><PAR>  Aromatic tertiary amino groups in the binder system have a higher catalytic      activity than aliphatic or araliphatic amino groups. </PAR><PAR>  Due to the low curing temperatures and the short curing times, the coating      agents according to the invention are preferably used for automobile      refinishing. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, they are highly suitable as top coats, fillers, varnishes,      primers or undercoats. </PAR><PAR>  The choice of the epoxy resin depends on the intended use. When used as a      top coat, aliphatic epoxy resins are preferably used, and aromatic epoxy      resins are also suitable for undercoats. </PAR><PAR>  The problem of discoloration which may occur on use as a varnish can be      avoided by incorporating preferably aliphatic tertiary amino groups into      the binder system. In the case of varnishes, low-chlorine or chlorine-free      epoxy resins should be employed; discoloration phenomena do not then      occur. </PAR><PAR>  The films obtained from the binders or coating agents according to the      invention have excellent properties in respect of hardness, elasticity and      reactivity. A further advantage is that the use of an external catalyst      can be omitted. </PAR><PAR>  If curing is to be carried out under baking conditions, i.e. at      temperatures of at least 100.degree. C., the coating agent according to      the invention can additionally contain a heat-curable ether- and/or amino-      and/or OH group-containing synthetic resin, such as, for example, phenol      or amino resins. </PAR><PAR>  The invention is illustrated in greater detail below with reference to      illustrative embodiments.
