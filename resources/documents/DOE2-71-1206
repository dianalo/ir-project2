<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-71-1206 </DOCNO><TEXT>The intent of this on-site safety review was to make a broad managementassessment of HFIR operations, rather than conduct a detailed in-depthaudit. The result of the review should only be considered as having identifiedtrends or indications. The Team's observations and recommendations arebased upon licensed reactor facility practices used to meet industrystandards. For the most part, these standards form the basis for manyof the comments in this report. The Team believes that a uniform minimumstandard of performance should be achieved in the operation of DOE reactors.In order to assure that this is accomplished, clear standards are necessary.Consistent with the provisions of past AEC and ERDA policy, the Teamhas used the standards of the commercial nuclear power industry. It isrecognized that this approach is conservative in that the HFIR reactorhas a significantly greater degree of inherent safety (low temperature,low pressure, low power) than a licensed reactor.</TEXT></DOC>
