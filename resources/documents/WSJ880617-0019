Cox Jr., who once built one of the largest agribusiness empires in the U.S., said he has agreed to plead guilty next week to a federal bank-fraud charge stemming from a loan at a Dallas bank where he served as a director.    The fraud charge, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, was filed in federal court in Dallas after a two-year investigation by the U.S. attorney here. Mr. Cox, the 41-year-old son of a prominent Texas oilman, had borrowed $80 million under a line of credit he used to finance some of his agribusiness interests. The federal government charges him with filing false information about the number of cattle he possessed as collateral for the loan.    The problem loan and the investigation have brought down the huge agribusiness empire Mr. Cox built over the past 10 years. It once included one of the nation's largest meat-packing concerns, one of the five largest cattle feed yards and feed and farm chemical businesses.    To pay back the loan and clear up his financial problems, Mr. Cox last September sold Swift Independent Corp., a huge meatpacking concern, to ConAgra Inc. and a Nebraska investor for about $100 million. He had bought it only 20 months earlier in a leveraged buy-out for about $15 million in cash and $115 million in debt and preferred stock.    In recent weeks, Mr. Cox also sold his interests in Friona Industries L.P., a cattle feedlot operator, and in an Austin, Texas, energy project, partly because those projects were having trouble getting financing as a result of their association with Mr. Cox while he was under investigation, a spokesman for Mr. Cox said.    &quot;The investigation chilled the Texas banking community's confidence in the projects,&quot; said the spokesman. Mr. Cox has received loans from foreign banks for his continuing businesses, which include real estate in Dallas and other Texas areas, his ranch and home outside Athens, Texas, and a small Amarillo feedlot, the spokesman said.    In a prepared statement, the apologetic cattleman referred to his filing false information as a &quot;serious mistake&quot; that has &quot;hurt my wife and children, our many loyal friends and employees.&quot; Mr. Cox said that he will enter his guilty plea when he is arraigned next week before a federal judge. &quot;I have no one to blame but myself and I am truly sorry that I have let all these people down,&quot; he said.    Mr. Cox also said he has resigned as chairman of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission because of the fraud charge. He had been on the commission for more than nine years.    Problems with the collateral for the loan contributed to a $360 million write-off for shaky loans and a $281.1 million loss in the second-quarter of 1986 by InterFirst Corp., the bank where he obtained the loan. InterFirst merged in 1987 with RepublicBank Corp. to form the now troubled First RepublicBank Corp. Mr. Cox defaulted on payments on the loan in June and December 1986. He fully repaid the loan in October 1987, including attorneys' fees and costs the bank incurred in restructuring the loan.    According to a statement of &quot;agreed facts&quot; filed by the U.S. attorney with the court, Mr. Cox told the bank in June 1986 that he didn't have the collateral he had pledged against the loan. &quot;This voluntary notification . . . preceded any investigation of Mr. Cox or any knowledge by the bank or the government of any wrongdoing by Mr. Cox,&quot; the statement said.    The statement also said Mr. Cox's borrowings from the bank, which had lent him money for about 10 years, were approved at &quot;arm's length&quot; and that &quot;none were the product of insider influence.&quot; Mr. Cox resigned as a director of InterFirst Bank Dallas and his father resigned as a director of the parent company in June 1986.    However, in a news release, the U.S. attorney, Marvin Collins, said &quot;Mr. Cox was a highly placed bank executive who knew better, but took full advantage of his influence and knowledge gained from his position as an insider.&quot; Mr. Collins's news release also stated: &quot;It is my hope that this case sends a strong message to those who think nothing will happen if they pay the money back. . . . We simply do not allow criminal conduct to go unpunished just because the money's paid back.&quot;    Mr. Cox isn't being investigated on any other charges and is current on all his loans outstanding, his spokesman said. A spokesman for First RepublicBank said bank officials know of no other pending investigation concerning Mr. Cox and the bank loan. </TEXT></DOC>
