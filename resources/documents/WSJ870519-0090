The owner of the company, Morse Tool Inc., proposes to sell most of the assets -- but not the cutting-tool factory itself -- to Harbour Group Ltd., a St. Louis competitor that would keep only 30 white-collar jobs in New Bedford. Before its Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court filing in January, Morse employed 375 people in the southeastern Massachusetts city.    However, the United Electrical Workers union, which represents workers at the plant, favors a bid by a Scottish company that pledges to keep the New Bedford factory open. The union has the support of a state agency that has made loans to the company, the New Bedford city government and the local chamber of commerce.    Yesterday, led by a Scottish bagpiper, the union and its allies rallied on the steps of the New Bedford City Hall to support the bid from International Twist Drill Holding Ltd., Peterhead, Scotland.    Controversy has surrounded the plant since at least 1982, when Morse -- then owned by Gulf andamp; Western Industries Inc. -- demanded concessions and the workers went on strike for three months, accusing Gandamp;W of failing to invest enough to keep Morse competitive. A year after the strike was settled, Gandamp;W said it wanted to sell the business.    In June 1984, after Gulf andamp; Western set a deadline for selling the company or liquidating it, Brian Lawler, then mayor of New Bedford, drew national attention when he threatened to use the city's eminent domain power to seize the factory. He never did. In September 1984, Morse was sold for about $12 million to James F. Lambert, a Troy, Mich., businessman.    Relations between the new owner and the union were unusually cooperative -- at first. There were wage concessions by the union, and employees were given a 12% interest in Mr. Lambert's holding company. Gov. Michael Dukakis visited the factory and described it as &quot;a Massachusetts success story.&quot; Last June, when Morse ran into renewed financial troubles, union and management jointly convinced a state agency, the Economic Stabilization Trust, to lend Morse $1.5 million.    But Ronald Carver, a union organizer, says, &quot;The $1.5 million wasn't enough. He was undercapitalized.&quot; By last fall, he says, the plant was running short of supplies. In November, the union backed a suggestion from the state agency that Mr. Lambert bring in new management. He refused, and in late January, made the bankruptcy-law filing.    Harbour Group, which offered $7.7 million for Morse's non-real estate assets including accounts receivables and inventory, plans to shift production to its own plants. The rival bidder, International Twist, yesterday formally offered $7.7 million for all the assets, including the factory. The state has agreed to allow International Twist to assume the $1.5 million loan, which would make more cash available for other creditors.    Neither Mr. Lambert nor his lawyer could be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
