(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A month after U.S. Sen. Jesse Helmsdefeated a black man for re-election in a racially divisivecampaign, Dan Blue was virtually assured of becoming NorthCarolina's first black speaker of the state House.   The Democrat's chances of winning the leadership position onFriday rose on Monday after his chief rival, Bob Hunter, withdrewfrom the race, citing the cause of party unity and saying he didn'tthink he had the votes to win.   Another candidate, John J. Hunt, announced that he, too, waspulling out of the race. Since Democrats outnumber Republicans81-39 in the House, Blue would be assured of being chosen speakers long as the Democrats maintained unity.   There are 14 blacks in the state House.   Blue, a Raleigh lawyer, was first elected to the Legislature in1981, has served as chairman of the legislative black caucus andsponsored the law declaring Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday anofficial state holiday.   He was active in the Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis campaignsin 1988.   He also was instrumental in changing the state's election lawslast year to lower from 50 percent to 40 percent the share of votesneeded to win a primary.   Blacks, in particular, had complained that the 50 percentrequirement discriminated against black candidates.   Last month, Helms beat former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt in abitter and racially divisive contest.</TEXT></DOC>
