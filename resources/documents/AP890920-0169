Colin L. Powell, PresidentBush's nominee to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   The panel voted 20-0 to recommend the nomination to the fullSenate. If confirmed, the 52-year-old Powell would be the firstblack and the youngest officer to hold the nation's top military job.   The committee decision followed nearly three hours of aconfirmation hearing in which Powell told Congress that cuts in theBush administration's budget request for various weapons programscould undermine a U.S.-Soviet pact on reducing strategic arms.   Powell, who served as President Reagan's national securityadviser, told lawmakers that political changes in the Soviet Unionshould not lead to cuts in the Star Wars program, land-based nuclearmissiles or the B-2 stealth bomber.   The House bill that cuts $502 million from the administration's$1.1 billion request for the multiple-warhead, rail-garrison MXmissile and eliminates all $100 million earmarked for thesingle-warhead, truck-mobile Midgetman ``would completely unhingeour START negotiating position,'' Powell said.   His remarks came one day after Secretary of State James A. BakerIII announced a shift in the U.S. position on the land-basedmissiles. The administration will no longer insist on elimination ofmobile missiles, according to Baker, who conceded the position hascomplicated negotiations.   The Soviets have two mobile missiles while the administration isasking Congress to fund the MX and Midgetman.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will meet withBush on Thursday before traveling to Wyoming for sessions with Bakerthis weekend.   During nearly three hours of questioning, Powell told thecommittee that scaling back the program to build 130 stealthbombers, considered the most expensive plane in history at $530million a copy, would force the United States to go rethink itsposition.   ``If there is no B-2, we have essentially started a phase-out.... Without the B-2, we no longer have the same START position thatwe did for the last several years and I believe it most unlikelythat there will be a treaty up here to ratify,'' he said.   ``We would have to go back quite a ways and renegotiate adifferent type of treaty.''   On other issues, Powell said:   _He supported using the armed forces in the war on drugs and inresponse to terrorist attacks.   _Cuts in troops in South Korea, Europe and other overseas postsin response to the growing sentiment in Congress for U.S. allies toshare more of the defense burden should not be done unilaterally.Powell said he was ``very hesitant'' to do it to satisfy currentbudget demands.   Powell, a decorated veteran of two combat tours in Vietnam, iscommander of the Army Forces Command in Fort MacPherson, Ga. He washailed by Democrat Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Republican PeteWilson of California as likely the best appointment made by Bush.   If confirmed by the full Senate, Powell would succeed Adm.William J. Crowe Jr., who is retiring Sept. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
