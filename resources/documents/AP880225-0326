The FCC also decided to extend the 12 percent rate of returnthat local telephone companies can earn on the payments theyreceive from long-distance companies for providing access to thelocal networks.   The FCC had set those rates in August 1986 to cover the calendaryears 1987 and 1988. The commission voted 3-0 to extend the ratesfor a third year because economic conditions are about the sametoday as they were when the rates were set two years ago.   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said the extension would also addstability to phone rates and give the commission more time torefine the formula for determining appropriate rates of return.   Gerald Brock, the FCC's top telephone staff official, said theaction has ``no direct effect'' on the commission's proposal toreplace rate-of-return regulation of ATandamp;T and the local Bell phonecompanies with a cap on the rates they can charge.   The agency proposed a broad rate-cap plan last August and, underpressure from Congress, said recently it will propose a morespecific plan, probably this spring.   Under the current form of regulation, the FCC sets the profitlevel it will allow for phone companies under its jurisdiction andallows that target to be met over a period of time.   A federal appeals court earlier this year struck down the FCC'srules for ordering refunds by companies that exceed theirauthorized rate of return because the rules didn't permit companiesthat earn less than the allowed rate to recoup any shortfalls.   The court invited the agency to fashion a new refund policy, butthe FCC has not yet responded.</TEXT></DOC>
