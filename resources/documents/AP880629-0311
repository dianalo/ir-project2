Robert B. Costello asked at apacked hearing of the House Armed Services Committee. ``Is theremore corruption now?''   ``We don't think so. Due to our improvements we can conductviable enforcement to apprehend, prosecute and jail procurementfraud perpetrators,'' he answered.   Added the witness:   ``We are firmly committed to insuring the integrity of theacquisition process and are continually improving it. Ouracquisition system works. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able toidentify persons who attempt to circumvent it. They may elude usfor a while, but in the end, we will prevail.''   Costell is the undersecretary of defense for acquisition andoversees the vast Pentagon purchasing system.   When Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the panel, askedCostello why ``we're seeing this case now,'' Costello answered,``in one word _ greed.''   The hearing was the first formal meeting of a congressionalcommittee to review the Pentagon acquisition since the ongoinginvestigation became public two weeks ago.   An hour before today's session started, well over 100 peoplewere lined up along the corridors in hopes of getting into thehearing room.   The Senate Armed Services Committee will also hold hearings intomilitary purchasing starting next month, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,chairman of the panel, said Tuesday.   Neither committee's hearings will delve into the currentcriminal investigation so as not to interfere with it. ProsecutorHenry Hudson says has said it may not be before the end of the yearuntil indictments are returned.   The probe focuses on allegations that defense contractors andconsultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagonofficials for contracting details.   Costello declined to discuss specifics of the current case, butsaid, ``we cannot and will not tolerate illegal acts that underminethe department's acquisition process.''   ``As the investigation's results become available, we will takeall appropriate actions, on a case by case basis,'' Costello said.``But let's not judge suspects in an ongoing investigation throughinnuendo. Let's await the facts and allow the investigators, ouradministrative processes, and the courts to do their jobs.''   He said the Pentagon has taken a number of steps to improve theway its billions of dollars are spent.   ``We have substantially improved the acquisition system,'' hesaid, outlining a series of steps, including more reviews ofcontracts, more use of commercial products rather than productsdesigned specifically for the military and increased competition.   ``Although not part of the acquisition system, our enforcementagencies contribute as much to the acqusition system as the DefenseAcqusition Board or the Defense Logistics Agency,'' he said.   Aspin noted that the investigation involves about 85 contractorsworth tens of billions of dollars and warned that those contractsmay be compromised.   ``This uncertainty raises a number of critical legal issues that_ until resolved _ will cloud the day-to-day operations of the DoDacquisition system,'' said Aspin.   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., noted that Congress has triedto reform the Pentagon procurement system for years.   ``Quite frankly,'' he told Costello, ``many of us aredisappointed to see defense procurement problems again in theheadlines. In fact, many in Congres and much of the public at largeare more than disappointed, they are tired of hearing about adefense acqusition systems that cannot seem to iron out itssystemic problems.''   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, which will conduct its own hearings next month, saidTuesay that ``I think we need to look at the procurement process.We have to re-examine it to find out where it can be improved.''   ``But we don't want to interfere with the currentinvestigation,'' he said. ``We've got to get to the systemic partof the procurement problem and correct that, but we should not usethose problems to excuse pure old fraud, waste and greed.''   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger believes there's noway to insure against fraud and he said he doesn't feel bad aboutthe current situation.   Appearing Sunday on ABC-TV, Weinberger said even his workingevery day ``cannot guarantee that there's going to be a total,complete, 100 percent honesty in the chain of people ... I don'thave any basis whatever for saying I didn't do enough, and Icertainly don't feel culpable.''   No changes in Pentagon policy have yet been proposed inCongress, but several plans are likely to be offered.   For example, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., a frequent critic ofcurrent Pentagon spending practices, has said he may try again towin approval of a law which he says would restrict the so-called``revolving door'' between government and private sector employment.</TEXT></DOC>
