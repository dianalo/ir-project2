Clark Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ECO </IN><TEXT>   Are you better off than you were six years ago, when the current economic expansion began? The answer depends increasingly on where you live. Commerce Department data indicate that regional differences in per-capita income have widened throughout the expansion, a trend that analysts don't expect to end soon.    That's a major change. In the four other expansions since 1960, regional variances in per-capita income had narrowed. Since 1982, however, the regions along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts generally have been doing better than the national average, while those in the interior have done less well. &quot;It has been a souffle economy,&quot; says Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles, &quot;firm on the outside and soft in the middle.&quot;    Mark Vitner, an economist at Barnett Banks of Florida, Jacksonville, doesn't expect a major change this year. &quot;Manufacturing is doing better in the Great Lakes region and elsewhere in the interior,&quot; he says. &quot;But the drought has hurt the farm states, and the outlook for the oil states isn't great, as long as prices stay weak.&quot;    The big gainer from the souffle economy has been New England, where per-capita income last year reached 120% of the national average, up from 109% in 1982. The big loser has been the once-booming Southwest, where the per-capita figure in 1987 was only 88% of the U.S. average, down from 99% in 1982.    Here is a brief look at the effect of the expansion in the nation's geographical areas, as defined by the Commerce Department:   NEW ENGLAND: Large increases in payrolls in service-type industries and construction have led to above-average gains in income. At the same time, the region has experienced relatively weak population growth. Workers who might have been drawn to the area by its prosperity, the Commerce Department says, were deterred by high housing costs. The stars of New England are Connecticut and Massachusetts, which ranked first and third, respectively, in per-capita personal income in 1987. By contrast, Vermont ranked 27th and Maine 31st.    The area might be slowing down this year, however, in part reflecting cutbacks by financial services businesses. In the year ended last May, for example, non-farm job growth in Massachusetts was 2.2%, well below the national average of 3.6%.    MIDDLE EASTERN STATES: The same factors that affect New England have also influenced the states in a region that the government designates the Mideast. Pennsylvania, however, is a peculiarity. The eastern half, with its focus on service businesses, has prospered. The western part, with its steel plants and other heavy industries, has had problems. The net result is that Pennsylvania's per-capita income last year was only 98% of the national average. But the situation might be changing this year; First Interstate's Mr. Jordan notes that the Pittsburgh area recently &quot;has been quite strong.&quot;    GREAT LAKES: The Rust Belt is staging a comeback, but progress has been slow. Weakness in automobile and other manufacturing, as well as agriculture, has held down income, though the manufacturing performance now is improving. In the past six years, the area has had almost no growth in population, partly reflecting migration to other parts of the U.S., and this has helped to keep per-capita income at 98% of the national average, the same figure attained in 1982.    PLAINS: The Plains states have had more than a fair share of the nation's problems, with troubles in agriculture, energy and basic manufacturing. Very low population growth kept per-capita personal income in 1987 at 96% of the national average, down from 97% in 1982. Analysts find no reason to expect much improvement in 1988, though manufacturing is looking better.    SOUTHEAST: Per-capita personal income in the Southeast is still the lowest in the nation, amounting to only 87% of the national average. But sharp gains in a few states, notably Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia, offset sharp losses in other states, so that the net result was a small gain for the 1982-87 period. Louisiana and West Virginia were the biggest losers. Barnett Banks says, &quot;The outheast has been a region of extremely good and extremely poor economic performance.&quot;    SOUTHWEST: In the first three decades after World War II, the Southwest prospered so mightily that it scarcely felt the nation's recessions. In the past six years, however, Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico have had recessions of their own, and only Arizona has managed to show a small gain. This year, even Arizona faces increasing problems. Since last summer, International Business Machines Corp., Motorola Inc. and other companies have announced layoffs. The biggest problem for the area, of course, has been the troubles of the oil industry.    ROCKY MOUNTAIN: Energy problems also dominate in the Rocky Mountain states, where the slide in per-capita income in the past six years has been only slightly less sharp than that of the Southwest. Even Colorado, the best performer in the area, has been unable to offset its energy-industry losses. Per-capita personal income for the area last year was 88% of the national average, down from 96% in 1982.    FAR WEST: No area that includes California could be all bad. Per-capita income in the Far West slipped slightly in the 198287 period, but was still 111% of the national average. In California, business is so good that companies this year are spending much of their time worrying not about current sales but about what air pollution and traffic congestion might do to their future business. </TEXT></DOC>
