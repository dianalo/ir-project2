It has been determinedthat this rule will not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,industries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicalregions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. The information collection requirements contained in this regulationand information requests authorized by this regulation have been reviewedand approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB Number0560-0024.This title and number of the Federal assistance program to which this ruleapplies are: Title_Commodity Loans and Purchases, Number 10.051, as foundin the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicableto this rule since CCC is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provisionof law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subjectmatter of this rule.It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this actionwill have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an Environmental ImpactStatement is needed.This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and CountyOfficials. See the notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, Subpart V, publishedat 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).As a result of certain changes made by the peanut industry concerning thehandling of peanuts, 7 CFR part 1446 was amended by an interim rule publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 15, 1988 (53 FR 35984) to providea shrink allowance of 2.0 percent for the 1988 through 1990 crops for thosehandlers who choose nonphysical supervision and abide by such use restrictionsas the Executive Vice President, CCC, specified.That interim rule was adopted in a final rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 20, 1989 (54 FR 30366). However, as aresult of the comments received in response to the interim rule, a proposedrule was published concurrently (54 FR 30395) which, if adopted, wouldhave increased the shrink allowance for such nonphysical supervision handlersto 4 percent for the 1989 and 1990 crops if use restrictions were agreedto and complied with by the handler.On August 14, 1989, the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 (the Act) was enacted.Section 601 of the Act requires, effective for the 1988 through 1990 cropsof peanuts, that the export obligation of a handler choosing nonphysicalsupervision shall be reduced by a shrinkage allowance, as determined bythe Secretary, to reflect actual dollar value shrinkage experienced byhandlers in commercial operations except that the allowance may not beless than 4.5 percent. However, section 601 also provides that the Secretarymay establish a lower shrikage allowance for handlers who fail to complywith restrictions on the use of peanuts as may be specified by CCC to takeinto account common industry practices.The comment period for the July 20, 1989, proposed rule ended August 20,1989. Five comments were received representing one area sheller group,one national and two area grower groups, and one State commodity commission.The sheller organization, although indicating that actual shrik of peanutsexceeded 4.5 percent, supported a 4.5 percent shrink adjustment. The threegrower groups supported the proposed rule on the condition that a studybe conducted to determine the actual shrink amount of peanuts. The Statecommission neither supported nor opposed the proposed rule but expressedconcern that the shrink adjustment should represent the actual amount ofshrink during storage and handling and that the shrink adjustment be fairto all segments of the peanut industry.Based on prior information and comments, this interim rule, issued in responseto the Act, amends 7 CFR part 1446 to permit for the 1988-90 crops of peanutsa shrink allowance 4.5 percent for nonphysical supervision handlers whocomply with CCC-specified use restrictions. With respect to handlers whodo not certify compliance with such restrictions, or do not comply withthe restrictions, the shrink allowance will remain at 0.5 percent. Thisrule does not affect handers who have chosen physical supervision.All public comments are invited. This rule is issued as an interim rulesince the Act amended section 359 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of1938 to specify a new conditional minimum of 4.5 percent and marketingof the 1988 crop is almost complete. In order that a final rule may beissued promptly so as to avoid undue uncertainty, it has been determinedthat the comment period should be limited to 30 days.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1446</ITAG>Loan Programs_Agriculture, Peanuts, Price support programs, Warehouse.<ITAG tagnum="81">Interim Rule</ITAG>Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1446, Subpart Warehouse Storage Loans and HandlerOperations for the 1986 Through 1990 Crops, is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1446_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
