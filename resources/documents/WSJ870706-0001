What makes the store unusual is its source of financing.    A Maryland state program designed to put minority, women and handicapped entrepreneurs into franchised businesses invested $85,000 in the store, which cost approximately $200,000 and opened in March. The owners -- Michael and Natalie Barron and Mr. Barron's mother -- put in $20,000. Dunkin' Donuts Inc. of Randolph, Mass., provided the balance through equipment financing.    The Barrons, who are black, were the first to benefit from the Maryland program. Since then, financing has been approved for a 7-Eleven store, an Arby's restaurant, four Fantastic Sam's hair salons, a Bonanza steakhouse and several other franchised outlets. &quot;We are swamped with applications,&quot; says Catherine D. Lockhart, deputy director of the Maryland Small Business Development Financing Authority.    The legislation that created the program was originally drafted to provide venture capital to the three disadvantaged groups. But opponents of that approach argued that venture capital was too risky and the program was reshaped to finance franchises, which have lower failure rates than other kinds of businesses.    Called the Equity Participation Investment Program, the financing plan provides up to 45% of the investment needed to open a franchise, or a maximum of $100,000. Owners must provide at least 10% of the start-up costs themselves.    The authority structures its deals in several ways, including preferred stock, subordinated debt and limited partnerships. To finance the Dunkin' Donuts store, it bought preferred stock, which the Barrons will repurchase at a premium over five years.    Authorities in several other states -- Florida, Massachusetts and Indiana included -- already are modeling similar programs after Maryland's. The program is attractive because franchises offer training, support and proven business ideas for owners who may have limited experience, says Indiana state Sen. Carolyn Mosby. &quot;I see franchising as the safest way to open a small business,&quot; she says.    ---   Vietnam Veterans Become Own Bosses   Vietnam-era veterans have reached the &quot;entrepreneurial age,&quot; the bracket from 35 to 45 years old, when many people decide to start their own businesses. As a result, more veterans are seeking business assistance than at any other time since the end of World War II, according to the Small Business Administration.    They are people like Charles Allen, 40, who spent 1965 to 1969 aboard a Navy destroyer. A few weeks ago, Mr. Allen and his wife Nancy bought a marina in Gun Barrel City, Texas, 50 miles southeast of Dallas. They financed part of the purchase with a $250,000 SBA-guaranteed loan, the third time they have tapped the agency for backing. Two previous SBA guarantees helped the Allens build a direct-mail business, which they sold to buy the marina.    In 1980, the SBA guaranteed $135 million in bank loans to Vietnam-era veterans, substantially less than the $238 million in loans guaranteed that year for veterans who served before or after the Southeast Asian conflict. Last year, however, the two groups were tied at $306 million apiece in loan guarantees. &quot;My guess is that in '87, it's going to tilt toward the Vietnam vet,&quot; says Gregory Diercks, assistant director in the SBA's Office of Veterans Affairs.    The SBA has a backlog of applications for the $20 million in direct loans it is authorized to make to Vietnam-era veterans each year. The agency also has begun a pilot program to train veterans in starting and running their own businesses.    The agency can count Mutt andamp; Jeff Pork Skins Inc. of Atlanta among the successful companies owned by Vietnam veterans. Tim Scaff, a Navy man from 1964 to 1971, bought into the company four years ago, joining partner (and Korean conflict veteran) Spencer Carter. Since obtaining a $114,500 SBA loan guarantee a year later, they have tripled the company's sales of deep-fried pork rind snack foods to $600,000 a year.    ---   FINDING CORPORATE CUSTOMERS to buy goods and services from minority-owned suppliers until now has been largely a charitable affair. The National Minority Supplier Development Council, a nonprofit group, has been the leading force in linking such buyers and sellers. Now, a publicly traded New York company, Univex Inc., is betting there are profits in such a middleman role. It has established the Minority Business Exchange to link corporate buyers with 12,000 minority-owned companies nationwide. MBX's commission: 5% of a contract's purchase price.    ---   THE NATIONAL MINORITY BUSINESS COUNCIL is calling for a nationwide certification program for businesses owned by women and minorities. As more states and corporations set up special procurement programs for such companies, confusion and duplication of effort is growing, says council President John F. Robinson. He proposes that the Small Business Administration conduct certifications that would be acceptable nationwide. An SBA spokeswoman says the agency will study the idea. </TEXT></DOC>
