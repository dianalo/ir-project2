The seismicS wave velocity was 38 m/sec. at the sea floor surface, and increasedwith the depth. The S wave velocity was relatively high in the sand -gravel strata, and was relatively low in the clayey stratum. The P wavewell logging showed the same tendency in velocity as described above.The laboratory test on the correlation between porosity (th) and thecalculation value of effective earth pressure (Pv) gave the followingformula for the soils at the respective liquid limits: th = tho - Cc*logPv where Cc is a compression index. the rigidity of the soils, basedon the measured wave velocity was expressed by the following formula:th = tho - Cr*logG where Cr is a rigidity index. The following equationswere derived from the correlation between LL, Cc, and Cr. Cc = 0.0027*(LL+ 280), and Cr = -0.0027*(LL + 155). Conclusively, G can be expressedby a function of th containing LL as a parameter. In contrast to conventionalempirical equations, there are no restrictions on th. Also, G can beformulated in relation to Pv, which is useful for wide application. (9figs, 1 ref)</TEXT></DOC>
