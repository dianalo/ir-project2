Foster Winans insider-trading episode has ended with a $282,000 settlement between the estate of David W.C. Clark and the Securities and Exchange Commission.    A federal judge in Manhattan ordered the estate to give up the funds for distribution in a way the SEC hasn't yet determined. The estate settled without admitting or denying the SEC's charges against Mr. Clark, a former lawyer.    The settlement is the last between the agency and defendants accused of trading on inside information misappropriated from The Wall Street Journal in 1983 and 1984 by Mr. Winans, a former Journal reporter and writer of the &quot;Heard on the Street&quot; column.    The agency settled similar claims against Mr. Winans; Peter Brant, a former broker who also pleaded guilty to criminal securities fraud charges; David Carpenter, Mr. Winans's former roommate and a former Journal news clerk; and Kenneth P. Felis, a former stockbroker with Mr. Brant at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    The men settled without admitting or denying allegations, and all but Mr. Carpenter disgorged profits. Mr. Brant gave up the most -- $454,000 -- and he and Mr. Felis also agreed to be barred from the securities industry for life.    Mr. Clark died in January, shortly before he was scheduled to be sentenced on a criminal conviction for offenses stemming from his embezzlement of more than $3.7 million from clients of his law firm.    Mr. Winans was sentenced to 18 months in prison; Mr. Carpenter to a probation term and community work; Mr. Felis to six months and Mr. Brant to eight months in prison. Both Mr. Felis and Mr. Brant were granted permission to serve their sentences on weekends. Since the federal Bureau of Prisons counts a weekend as three days -- because the prisoner spends at least a portion of each of three days in jail -- Mr. Felis's term will be 60 weekends, and Mr. Brant's, 80 weekends. </TEXT></DOC>
