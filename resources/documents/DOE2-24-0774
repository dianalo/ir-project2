<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-0774 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new approach to the ''extended relativity'' principle proposed by Recami,Mignani, and others, in which the speed of light (c) is invariant withrespect to both subluminal (vandless;c) and superluminal (Vequivalentc{sup 2}/vandgt;c)linear generalized Lorentz transformations in vacuum, is presented, inorder to take into account some novel nonlinear velocity transformations(v, V) {yields} (v', V'), associated with changes in motion at the interfacebetween vacuum and a deformable hadronic medium, envisaged in Santilli'snotion of quarks as mutations of physical leptons (''eletons'') insidehadrons. The new approach demands a generalization of the usual ralation(vV = c{sup 2}) between subluminal and superluminal inertial frames orobjects to the (Lie-admissible) form (vV = c{sup 2} = V'{sup 2}-v'{sup2}), which is tantamount to a principle of relativistic invariance invelocity space.</TEXT></DOC>
