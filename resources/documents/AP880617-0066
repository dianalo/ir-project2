(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A hacker's success in penetrating anon-classified Pentagon computer network and searching NASA andNavy data banks shows security measures are failing to keep pacewith sophisticated computer systems, scientists say.   ``It's a subject that makes (computer) people turn pale andsweat,'' said Hal Masursky, a member of a National Academy ofSciences subcommittee on computer security.   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Thursday that one or morehackers, or computer buffs, successfully penetrated a DefenseDepartment computer network the night of May 16, then examinedfiles at the lab, the Patuxent Naval Air Station in Maryland and atleast one other facility into the early hours of May 17.   No damage was done, no data was stolen and the incident is underinvestigation by the FBI and security officers from NationalAeronautics and Space Administration headquarters in Washington,said Haskell G. O'Brien, JPL's manager of communications andcomputing network services.   The break-in shows that ``fewer people are monitoring (computeraccess) than should be. More people need to keep their eyes open,''said Cliff Stoll, a computer scientist at California's LawrenceBerkeley Laboratory. ``It's unfortunately easy for people torandomly break in.''   The network that was breached, named ARPANET, is anon-classified network for sharing scientific information, and isoperated by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency, O'Brien said.   Thousands of computers are connected to the network at hundredsof U.S. and foreign universities and research centers, includingsome military research facilities and other NASA offices, he added.   ``Networking has spread like wildfire, but the securityprecautions are a new art,'' said Masursky, a Flagstaff,Ariz.-based U.S. Geological Survey geologist who worked on severalNASA space missions. ``With a hacker who is very clever, trying toguarantee he can't access things (computers) is very difficult.''   O'Brien said authorities don't know if the hacker operated fromthe United States or abroad, although NASA suspects involvement bythe Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, West Germany, which has beenlinked to past computer security breaches.   ``The signature looked a little like things they do, but alsolooked a little different,'' he said.   A spokesman for the club told The Associated Press in Bonn, WestGermany, that he was unaware of the break-in.   O'Brien called the incident serious because programs used todesign microcircuits could have been damaged.   Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen said from Washington that``there is no indication that any classified information has beenobtained by such hacker activity.''   The break-in was the third known violation of computer securityat JPL in two years, O'Brien said, citing a previously publicizedAugust 1986 break-in by a West German hacker, and another lastsummer, in which the perpetrator was caught but not prosecuted.   The hacker in last month's incident first gained access to thePentagon network through another computer at an undisclosedlocation, O'Brien said. Once inside, the hacker guessed a password_ the name of a JPL employee _ to gain access to the lab's computer.   The hacker then used JPL's Digital Equipment Corp. computer as aconduit to enter another ARPANET computer at Patuxent, whereauthorities noticed something was amiss and notified JPL, O'Briensaid, adding he didn't know how many other computers also werepenetrated.   ``NASA security people are working with the FBI investigatingthe details of this,'' he said.   JPL spokesman George Alexander said that as soon as the break-inwas discovered, ``we pulled JPL out of the network.''   ``Our procedures are being tightened considerably to make surethis won't happen again,'' Alexander said.   In April, a West German prosecutor revealed that a 24-year-oldWest German hacker linked his home computer to about 50 U.S.military computers by telephone. The electronic break-ins weredetected in August 1986 by Lawrence Berkeley officials.   Targets included computers at JPL, the Berkeley lab and AirForce Systems Command in El Segundo, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
