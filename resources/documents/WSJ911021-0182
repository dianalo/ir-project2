It asked to be connected to all theother supercomputers in the world. Still not enough power. Sothe computer was hooked up to all the mainframes in theworld, then all the minicomputers, then all the personalcomputers. When that still didn't work, the computer askedfor a link to all the remaining computer chips -- in cars,microwaves, VCRs, digital watches, etc. The theologian askedone final time, &quot;Is there a God?&quot; The computer responded:&quot;There is now.&quot;   As computers march steadily toward ubiquity, if notomnipotence, we asked around for stories about ways thatcomputer chips are helping out in the home -- and ways theyare waiting to jump out and bite you when you are leastexpecting it. Here's what we found.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   The Good News: Prices                                                                                                          Whatever else happens, most prices keep going down, down,down. Link Resources, a New York market-research firm, saysthe average videocassette recorder costs $225 today, downfrom $500 five years ago. Prices of compact-disk players havefallen to $130 from $250; camcorders to $650 from $1,350; a19-inch color-television set to $400 from about $550; laserprinters to $725 from $1,550; and facsimile machines to $400from more than $2,000. Moreover, today's systems ofteninclude more features than in the past -- such as the abilityfor a CD player to handle multiple disks.   The one area where Link says prices have risen is inpersonal computers, where average prices have jumped to$1,800 from $1,000 or $1,100 five years ago. But Link saystoday's PCs have processors that operate several times fasterthan their predecessors, hard-disk storage capacity that is35 times greater than in the past, better graphics, andbuilt-in software.                                                                                                          Talk at Your Own Risk                                                                                                          What do you get when you mix call waiting and an answeringmachine? An insurance salesman recently found out.   The salesman, who wants to remain anonymous for reasonsthat will become clear, started to leave a message on afriend's answering machine, when a click in his earpiece toldhim he had received another call. It was from his girlfriend,so the salesman switched to that call. The girlfriend, alawyer, had had a shot that day and complained that her&quot;tushy&quot; hurt. The salesman sang &quot;Little Darlin.&quot; He referredto the woman as &quot;Mushy Tushy.&quot;   Alas, the salesman had somehow failed to end that firstcall. Through the vagaries of modern electronics, the wholemushy 20-minute conversation was recorded for posterity. Thefriend who got the message bumped into the salesman a fewdays later, asked how &quot;Ole Mushy Tushy&quot; was doing and keptwalking.                                                                                                          All In One                                                                                                          For some time, the personal-computer andconsumer-electronics industries have been struggling toproduce a sort of electronic Swiss Army knife, combining --on one phone line -- the personal computer, fax, laserprinter, telephone and telephone-answering machines thatclutter people's desks now. But results have been mixed.   So far, consumers can combine practically any two devices.Faxes can double as printers. Telephones and answeringmachines can be combined, maybe even with a fax in them.Personal computers can serve as telephone-answering machinesand faxes. But the devices still take up too much space, andtoo many phone lines.   Anindya Bose, an analyst with Link Resources, saystelephone-equipment suppliers have built prototypes ofcontrollers that limit the need for extra phone lines.Instead of brushing off an incoming call if, say, a faxmachine was using the line, the controllers would takeadvantage of phone networks' digital capabilities to juggleall the traffic over that line. Other devices that will beavailable within the next year, he says, will allow a personto have a personal computer accept an incoming fax, havesoftware read it, have more software turn the words into avoice message and have a phone-answering device play thatmessage when the user checks in.                                                                                                          But Can She Set the Clock?                                                                                                          It happens in the best of families.   Peter McWilliams, author of the Personal ComputerHandbook, says that in researching a book on consumerelectronics he would buy and test lots of VCRs -- one ofwhich he gave to his mother. When he was traveling, he wouldcall her and ask her to tape various shows for him, and shewould give him the tapes.   After months of this, Mr. McWilliams discovered that hismother didn't know how to program the VCR. She could onlytape something while it was being broadcast. She was takingafternoons off work and setting alarms to wake herself uplate at night to tape things for him, because she was tooembarrassed to confess her inability.                                                                                                          Where the Growth Is                                                                                                          Total sales of consumer electronics grew 4.1% in 1990 tonearly $33 billion and should grow 3% in 1991, according tothe Electronic Industries Association. The big growth areasin 1990: projection TVs, up 32%; camcorders, up 30%; andcompact-disk players, up 32%. Those growth rates are allexpected to slow this year, thoughto 2.6% for projection TVs,10% for camcorders and 9.2% for compact-disk players.   Cellular-telephone sales are expected to reach $1.4billion this year, up 9.4% from 1990. VCR sales should risejust 1.8%, but the association adds that they will reach 74%penetration of American homes.                                                                                                          You Bought It. Now What?                                                                                                          One of the biggest words among home-computer companiesthese days is &quot;content&quot; -- as in, where's the content? Thesecompanies have worked for years to produce computers withgood graphics, with processors fast enough to handle imagesand sound, and with attachments, such as a form of CD playerthat lets users store lots of images. But these systemsaren't selling well because there isn't much to do with them.   A few companies have done imaginative things. Voyager Co.,Santa Monica, Calif., sells CDs that provide a famous pieceof music, extensive commentary, a biography of the composer,a glossary and funny quizzes. A user can navigate through themusic at will, tracking themes, tracing references to thecomposer's life, getting unusual terms illustrated withpieces of the composition. Some media organizations have alsoproduced histories of the Gulf War, say, that let purchasersbrowse through pictures and text in a sort of freeassociation. A few multimedia encyclopedias have drawn anaudience. But that's about it.   Tim Bajarin, an executive vice president of CreativeStrategies Research International, a consulting firm in SantaClara, Calif., says software tools recently became availableto make it easier to create such packages. But the industryis caught in one of its chicken-and-egg problems. Fewcompanies are working on content because consumers haven'tbought enough systems to make a big market. And consumers arereluctant to buy because there aren't enough multimediatitles available.                                                                                                          Something for His Personnel Composter                                                                                                          People seem to be getting more computer-literate, butsometimes appearances can be deceiving. Matt Fitzsimmons, theowner of a ComputerLand store in White Plains, N.Y., haddealt several times with one customer -- often enough tofigure that the man knew something about computer terms. Thenthe man came in one day, needing a mouse, which moves thecursor around the screen, and a math co-processor, whichhelps the central processor do its number-crunching. The manasked for a &quot;moose&quot; and a &quot;compressor.&quot;                                                                                                          Making the TV Work                                                                                                          Frox Inc. is drawing a lot of attention for its newhome-entertainment system. The system essentially gives thetelevision the capability of a powerful work station that cancontrol all the other electronic devices.   A user, for instance, can tell the system what compactdisks he owns. When he wants to play that CD, he flipsthrough his list of titles on the television screen. Heselects one, and the system, drawing on a library ofinformation concerning 35,000 CDs, shows what songs are onthe CDs and how long they are, and lets him program the CDplayer to play whatever tracks he wants to hear. The systemalso cleans up the TV signal to eliminate jitter, andmassages the signal to make the picture look good even whendisplayed on one of Frox's 10-foot screens.   Figuring that most buyers will be movie buffs, Frox, basedin Sunnyvale, Calif., is including a library of informationon 40,000 movies. It will also offer a service that will pumpthe television set's memory full of the latest financial andsports news every 20 minutes, for viewing if the buyer wantsit.   What has the computer types most excited, though, is theuser interface designed by Andy Hertzfeld -- a co-founder ofSun Microsystems Inc. The interface lets someone program aVCR by browsing through the next seven days of televisionlistings, which appear on the screen as they might in a localnewspaper. Putting a cursor, shaped like a hand, on top of aVCR symbol in the listing tells the system to tape it.   All remote-control operations can be handled by using thehand symbol, controlled by a joystick, to touch buttons thatappear on the screen. The buttons are designed to be easilydecipherable, so that a fast-forward button looks as thoughit would make something go fast-forward.   Frox has begun taking orders and is starting to shipsystems this fall. For a mere $10,000 to $20,000, one can beyours.   ---   Mr. Carroll is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's New York bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
