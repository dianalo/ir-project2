Public Comments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>The Department of Energy (DOE) wishes to revise its contracting proceduresfor management and operating (Mandamp;O) contracts. The Department has conductedan intensive evaluation of its existing practices relating to award-feeprovisions of the Mandamp;O contract providing for the operation of DOE'sproduction, laboratory, and test facilities. The proposed changes to theDepartment of Energy Acquisition Regulation, discussed herein, are a resultof this evaluation.The Department's study revealed a need for more standardization of itsaward fee contract provisions relating to management and operating (Mandamp;O)contracts, and further determined that existing clauses cited at 916.405and referenced for use in Mandamp;O contracts do not include necessary featuresas discussed in the subsequent paragraphs. The five contract clauses atsection 916.405 are proposed to be replaced by a single clause for usein Mandamp;O contracts. This new clause will be similar to the existing clauses,in that it will contain subparagraphs which parallel the subject matterof the five existing clauses. However, there are certain key differences.Since the Acquisition Regulation contains a separate part for Mandamp;O contracting,Part 970, the new clause will be located in Subpart 970.52, with implementinginstructions located in Subpart 970.15.The new clause, to be located at 970.5204-54, will be mandatory for Mandamp;Ocontracts with award fee provisions.For payment provisions, the new clause would refer to the <T3>Payments and Advances </T3>clause from section 970.5204-16, ratherthan creating separate procedures. This will eliminate conflicts in theuse of existing clauses, which envision a voucher/payment process, ratherthan the letter-of-credit drawdown procedures which are more prevalentin Mandamp;O contracts. For convenience, the new clause would identify the Fee Determination Official(FDO) by title, making such designation part of the body of the contract,rather than including such identification in the Performance EvaluationPlan.The new clause would establish clearly that the FDO may use any availableinformation in his/her evaluation of contractor performance. The new clausewould also explicitly provide that the FDO may withhold fee for unsatisfactoryperformance in any important area of performance required by the contract,regardless of whether that performance area is specified in the PerformanceEvaluation Plan. Although such powers were implied in the existing clauses(e.g., the FDO's decision is absolute, not subject to the appeal proceduresof its Disputes clause), they were not explicit. The Department wishesto ensure that this important leverage is emphasized in its award-fee Mandamp;Ocontracts.The new Mandamp;O clause would eliminate a provision allowing the FDO tospecify that unearned award fee may be carried over to subsequent periods. The new clause would establish a six-month appraisal period as the standard.In its evaluation of its award-fee practices under Mandamp;O contracts, theDepartment found the six-month appraisal period to be most commonly usedand preferable to more frequent appraisals, which were more costly to administerwithout corresponding benefits. The new regulation will allow deviationsto this standard, pursuant to existing deviation procedures.The Department's evaluation of its current procedures determined that mostcontractors are submitting self-assessments which are of little value inthe Department's award fee determinations. The new clause would requirethe contractor to submit a performance self-assessment, which will be usedby the DOE in its evaluation of the contractor's management. The Departmentwishes to establish a system whereby a contractor will be encouraged tosubmit realistic assessments of its own performance, recognizing problemsand deficiencies and addressing plans for correcting such shortcomingsin the future. Under the new clause, contractor self-assessments will berequired, and will be evaluated as part of the appraisal of contractormanagement efforts. Unrealistic self-assessments, or those which revealinadequate planning to avoid recurrence of problems, may result in lowerawards.A section is proposed to be added to explain revisions required to the<T3>Payments and Advances</T3> clause when an award fee arrangement isused, and to clarify other areas of the clause.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedural Requirements</ITAG>a. Review Under Executive Order 12291The Department has concluded that this proposed rule is exempt from therequirement for review by the Office of Management and Budget under E.O.12291 pursuant to an exemption for procurement regulations as discussedin OMB Bulletin No. 85-7 of December 14, 1984.b. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility ActThis proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of1980 (Pub. L. 96-345), which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibilityanalysis for any rule expected to have significant economic effect on asubstantial number of small entities. The Department has concluded thatthis proposed rule is expected to have no significant effect on interestrates, tax policy or liabilities, the cost of goods or services, or otherdirect economic considerations. Nor is it expected to have a significanteffect on indirect economic considerations. The Department certifies thatthis proposed rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantialnumber of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysishas been prepared.c. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection requirement contained in this proposed ruleis approved under OMB Control Number 1910-4100. It imposes no additionalpaperwork burden.d. Review Under the National Environmental Policy ActThe Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not constitutea major Federal action having a significant effect on the environment underthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 432 <T3>et seq</T3>. (1976)), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations(40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508) or DOE guidelines (10 CFR Part 1021).Therefore, an environmental assessment is not required pursuant to theAct.e. Review Under Executive Order 12612The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve issueswhich are expected to have substantial direct effect on traditional statefunctions or their institutional interest and, thus, the ``federalism''assessment requirements of Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October30, 1987) do not apply.f. Public HearingThe Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve asubstantial issue of fact or law, nor should it have a substantial effecton the nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses.Therefore, pursuant to Pub. L. 95-91, the DOE Organization Act, and theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the Department does not planto hold a public hearing on this proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to participate in this rulemaking by submittingdata, views, or arguments with respect to the proposed changes set forthin this notice. Three copies of written comments should be submitted tothe address indicated in the <T2>``Address'' </T2>section of this notice.

Thecontractor shall be promptly advised in writing of the determination, andthe reasons why the award fee was or was not earned.

The FDOwill review the contractor's Self-Assessment as part of his/her evaluationof the contractor's management during the period. An unrealistic Self-Assessmentwill result in lower award fee determinations. The contractor will notbe penalized for a realistic Self-Assessment, although deficiencies notedby the contractor may be reflected in the government's evaluation. TheSelf-Assessment itself will not be the basis for the award fee determination.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note</T4>_In subparagraph (d), insert the appropriate number of awardfee periods and corresponding award fee amounts. Ordinarily, in a managementand operating contract for an ongoing operation, award fee periods shouldbe six (6) months in duration, and the award fee available should be distributedevenly among award fee periods. Variations from this arrangement shouldbe justified prior to negotiation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-16931 Filed 7-18-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
