Chairman L.William Seidman said Monday.   Seidman said a loss to the insurance fund, if any, would dependon how much the FDIC spends to resolve the problems of FirstRepublicBank of Dallas, which earlier this month received a $1billion infusion of government aid.   The deterioration of Texas banks, hard hit by losses on realestate and energy loans, has raised concern about the health of theinsurance fund, which backs deposits of up to $100,000 in 13,700commercial banks.   Speaking at a luncheon meeting with reporters, Seidman said itis too soon to say with certainty what the cost of restoring FirstRepublicBank to health will be. But, he said the $5 billion to $6billion estimates of some are ``far higher than anything that islikely to be required.''   He said the $1.7 billion cost of the 1984 bailout of ContinentalIllinois Bank andamp; Trust Co., which was about the same size as FirstRepublicBank, ``is the best guide we have.''   The FDIC's initial outlay on First RepublicBank could be higherthan the ultimate cost, just as it was in the case of Continentalwhen the agency spent $4.5 billion, Seidman said.   However, he said the FDIC now usually tries to structure bankrescues so that the initial cash cost is close to the ultimate cost.   If the First RepublicBank cost is in the $1.7 billion range andif banks fail this year at about the same rate as last year, then``it is possible we will have a loss in 1988,'' he said.   Last year, a post-Depression record of 184 banks failed.Forty-four have failed so far this year and Seidman said heexpected the 1988 total to be roughly the same as 1987.   As failures have increased, the steady growth of the FDIC fund _from $4.6 billion in 1970, $11.6 billion in 1980 to $17.9 billionin 1985 _ has slowed. The fund finished 1986 with $18.2 billion and1987 with $18.3 billion.   Seidman said the 1988 loss, if it occurs, would be ``somethingunder 5 percent ... certainly under ... $1 billion.'' He said hedid not see any prospect for what he termed a substantial loss, oneapproaching 20 percent, or about $3.5 billion.   He contrasted the relatively healthy condition of the FDIC fundwith that of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., whichinsures deposits in 3,170 savings institutions. FSLIC was insolventuntil last fall when money began flowing fromcongressionally-authorized bond sales. It has had to keep bankruptSandamp;Ls open because it lacked the money to pay off depositors.</TEXT></DOC>
