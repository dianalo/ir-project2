September is when the stock market is most likely todecline, based on market history. October is when a crash ismost likely to occur. Of course, history isn't necessarilydestiny. But several market veterans predict that thisautumn, leaves won't be the only thing falling.</LP><TEXT>   Many investors are already familiar with the dangers ofOctober. The great crash of October 1929 set the pattern, andthe 500-point crash in the Dow Jones Industrial Average onOct. 19, 1987, reinforced it. Those were the biggest, butthey weren't the only October debacles.   People with long memories may recall the big drop in 1937,or the &quot;October massacres&quot; of 1978 and 1979. Then there wasthe &quot;mini-crash&quot; of 1989, in which the Dow industrials shed190 points in one day. Six of the 10 biggest single-day dropsin U.S. market history (measured by percentage declines inthe industrial average) happened in October.   Even so, as the accompanying table from Ned Davis Researchshows, October on average is only the fourth-worst month. Theworst is September, with an average decline (since 1900) of1.1%. &quot;The most startling declines have been in October, butthe most consistent declines have been in September,&quot; saysRobert J. Farrell, chief market analyst for Merrill Lynch andamp;Co.   Years with October crashes or massacres &quot;were generallybull-market years in which you got to the fall and had anoverbought market,&quot; Mr. Farrell says. That pretty welldescribes this year, too, he says.   This year has one thing in its favor. Interest rateslately have been falling. In ill-fated Octobers of the past,rates were usually rising. But Mr. Farrell doubts that willbe enough to save investors from a decline this autumn. &quot;Ithink we're setting up for a decline,&quot; he says. &quot;I think themarket is showing loss of momentum. There are a lot of thingsthat look toppy about it, though I don't know when it's goingto give way.&quot;   Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-FirstAdvisers, says one reason fall tends to be weak is that &quot;weusually have a summer rally.&quot; After that, &quot;investors tend torun out of ideas and out of cash.&quot; That's especially truethis year, he says: Professional investors' cash reserves arethe tiniest they've been in at least a decade.   &quot;We've had one foot out the door for a long time,&quot; Mr.Stovall says. &quot;I have a feeling the market's been runningahead of itself most of the year, running on various octaneratings of enthusiasm. It was very high on Desert Storm, andfairly high on the collapse of the Soviet system. I think themarket could move down to 2750 to 2850 between now and theend of the year. . . . .We've already built into prices anawful lot of good things that may happen later.&quot;   Justin Mamis, technical analyst with Gordon Capital, saysbig October declines usually &quot;have not come out of the blue.&quot;Typically, he says, they've been preceded by a particularprice pattern: big rally, moderate decline, then a rally thatstruggles back to or above the old highs. This year, he says,has &quot;similar characteristics.&quot;   The market is &quot;building up for a downside sequence worsethan what we've had so far {this year},&quot; he says. He predictsthe Dow industrials will fall below 2830, possibly panickinginvestors who right now are complacent. Mr. Mamis calls thiscomplacency &quot;the lulling on the downside. People believe youdon't sell weakness, you buy weakness.&quot; He views stocks asripe for a substantial fall decline. &quot;October,&quot; he says, &quot;isthe sword of Damocles.&quot;   Joseph Feshbach, technical analyst for Shearson LehmanBrothers, is also pessimistic. &quot;I think we're making a bigtop in here. Possibly {stocks} have one final blowoff in thefourth quarter, and then that's it,&quot; he says. &quot;You can'tconvince me that this is the start of something big. . . .Ithink the bull market is in its latter stages. Even if youtell me that T-bills are going to zero, you just won'tconvince me otherwise.&quot;   Asked why stock-market declines tend to occur in the fall,Mr. Feshbach laughs. &quot;I really don't know,&quot; he says. &quot;I couldmake some stuff up, but I don't know why it is that way.&quot; Mr.Mamis is equally candid. &quot;As a technician, I don't care why,&quot;he says. &quot;I just care what.&quot;   Ned Davis, president of the Nokomis, Fla., research firmthat bears his name, theorizes that fall tends to be weakpartly because other months tend to be strong. Corporatepension plans and individual retirement plans tend to putmoney into stocks in January through mid-April, for example.By contrast, he says, &quot;There's nothing special aboutSeptember and May {the second-worst month, on average} thatbrings money in.&quot;   Mr. Davis is cautious about the market, mainly becausestocks are so high by most yardsticks. Dividend yields aredown near 3% -- historically an area when rallies have toppedout. And Standard andamp; Poor's industrials sell for more thanthree times their book values, also very high by historicalstandards.   Yale Hirsch, editor of the newsletter Smart Money andauthor of the annual Stock Trader's Almanac, is moreoptimistic about the fall. October has &quot;gotten a badreputation,&quot; he says, but &quot;a lot of bear markets have endedin October,&quot; including those of 1974 and 1990. So October issometimes a good month to buy, he says.   This year, Mr. Hirsch thinks stocks will pull through thefall just fine, perhaps with a September decline followed bya bounce back in October. With a presidential election comingup, he figures that &quot;Mr. Greenspan {chairman of the FederalReserve Board} will be accommodative,&quot; keeping interest rateslow.   Norman Fosback, president of the Institute for EconometricResearch in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., attributes no specialmeaning to September and October declines. &quot;These things havegot to happen some time,&quot; he says. &quot;Some month is bound tohave more dramatic events than others, merely by randomchance.&quot;   Though he has no special dread of the fall months, Mr.Fosback says the market is &quot;clearly in overvalued territory.&quot;He also is concerned by the &quot;huge amount of stock&quot;corporations are issuing. So, after years of suggesting thatpeople be fully invested, he's urging investors to take somechips off the table. He recommends that investors be 30% incash, and would raise that to 35% if the Dow industrials riseabove 3050.   ---            September, October Vie for Worst Month                                                                                                          September is the month in which stock-market investors aremost likely to sustain losses.
