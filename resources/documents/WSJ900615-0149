Klein</HL><DATE>06/15/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A8</SO><LP>   Norwalk, Calif. -- David Johnson had just completed thefirst day of the two-day decathlon at the USA/Mobil Track andamp;Field Championships on a California-perfect Tuesday evening31 points ahead of his national-record pace, but hishappiness was not complete.   Surveying the remnants of a crowd of, maybe, 200 peoplethat had watched the day's five events at Cerritos Collegestadium, he observed that more public attention to hisendeavor would be nice.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Better promotion wouldn't have hurt,&quot; said thebroad-shouldered Montanan, the defending champ. &quot;Thepublicity gave the meet's dates as June 14-16. Today is June12. Does that mean we're not here?&quot;   U.S. decathletes, those one-man bands of track and field,have been complaining thusly for some years, partly becauseforeigners have dominated the form since Bruce Jenner rodehis 1976 Olympic victory to screen, sportswear andWheaties-box stardom, and we Yanks tend to ignore thingsathletic that we don't win.   But off the results of the competition that ended in cool,breezy weather here on Wednesday night before a gatheringeven smaller than Tuesday's, this could change. Two fellas,27-year-old Johnson and Dan O'Brien, a springy, 23-year-oldU. of Idaho dropout, topped the 8,400-point mark over 10events on the activity's complex points-for-performancescales, something that never happened before in this land.   Johnson's 8,600 was best, and it would have been anAmerican record under recently set standards to allow forrevised javelin specifications if a couple of its componentsweren't wind-aided. The score topped the 8,488 points thatwon Christian Schenk of East Germany the 1988 Olympic goldmedal, and was the best anywhere for the intervening twoyears.   O'Brien collected 8,483 points, and his performance waseven more noteworthy on a number of grounds. This was hisfirst national meet, and only the eighth decathlon he'dcompleted. Unlike most of the elite field of 17, he had nomajor U.S. or collegiate titles in his gym bag.   He was, moreover, a spotty collegiate performer, due toinjuries, alcohol and drug problems, and, relatedly, anacademic record than left him mostly ineligible for sports.&quot;Let's just say I was more interested in partying thanstudying,&quot; says the engaging young man, whose father wasblack and mother Finnish, and who was adopted by a KlamathFalls, Ore., couple named O'Brien at age two.   But the 6-foot-3, 185-pounder was a multiple-event statehigh school track champ in Oregon, and finally got hisdecathlon act together in April by scoring 8,267 points at aninvitational meet at Washington State University. That wasthe ninth-best score for any American, ever.   &quot;He has the skills to be a great decathlete, and he's gotthe perfect temperament, too. By that I mean he can shrug offa bad performance and be right back on track a few minuteslater,&quot; says Mike Keller, his coach at Idaho. &quot;Dan has lackedmaturity and focus in the past, but he's developing them, andhe's very coachable. If you lead him, he'll quickly run aheadof you. He picks things up so fast it's scary.&quot;   It's perhaps a coincidence, but Johnson also was no BoyScout as a youth, having spent his early high school years inMissoula, Mont., perpetrating various kinds of mischief. &quot;Ideveloped my arm throwing rocks at cars, and got my legs inshape running from the cops,&quot; he wryly recalls. Then he movedto Corvallis in track-crazy Oregon and simultaneouslydiscovered religion and track and field. They got him throughAzusa Pacific U. and national decathlon titles in 1986 and'89.   Despite some ups and downs caused by the injuries that areinescapable in the grueling discipline (1968 Olympic champBill Toomey once said that behind every successful decathleteis a good physician), Johnson has been the U.S.'s best in theevent for most of the past five years, and his U.S. record of8,549 points at the '89 nationals signaled his arrival as aninternational force.   In this competition, though, the vet found himself chasingthe newcomer -- and almost not catching him. O'Brien not onlyled the field mathematically through the first day, but alsowon four of the five events outright. He ran the 100-meterdash in 10.4 seconds; long-jumped 26 feet, 4 1/2 inches; putthe shot 50-4 3/4 and high-jumped 6-11 3/4. His long-jumpmark was a world's decathlon best, surprising, he admitted,even him.   If O'Brien hadn't sagged a bit in the 400-meter run, theday's last go, he'd have also set a world's first-day pointsrecord. As it was, his 4,656 was a U.S. mark, led Johnson by297, and trailed by just 21 the score England's mighty DaleyThompson posted when he set the world mark of 8,847 at the1984 Olympics.   The brawnier Johnson conceded he was impressed, butpointed toward the morrow, where his strengths in the polevault and javelin lay. &quot;I hadn't seen him do his thingsbefore, but he hasn't seen me do mine,&quot; he allowed.   And, verily, that was what came to pass. Johnsonoutvaulted O'Brien, 16-4 3/4 to 14-1 1/4, and his javelinheave of 222-5 was almost 35 feet longer, moving him intofirst. O'Brien could have rallied by running the last event-- the 1,500 meters -- nine seconds faster than Johnson, butwound up eight seconds slower. While it's remarkable thatanyone could run a mile at all after an 8 1/2-hour day ofdashing and tossing, O'Brien confirmed that his fade bespokethe need for better conditioning, as well as more time aroundthe vaulting pit.   Afterward, champ and challenger faced the press, and wavedthe red, white and blue. &quot;Some jaws are gonna drop in Europewhen they see these scores,&quot; said Johnson as O'Brien nodded.&quot;This shows that the decathlon is back in the U.S.&quot;   And when O'Brien predicted he'd improve, Johnson said thathe'd better. &quot;I hope he beats me in '92 at Barcelona, becauseif he does it'll mean he's topped 9,000 points,&quot; he smiled.</TEXT></DOC>
