<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-68-0598 </DOCNO><TEXT>A low pressure plasma spraying technique for depositing high-Tc YBCO thickfilms has been developed. Films with thickness ranging 20-100 {mu}m havebeen prepared using Y/sub 0.3/Ba/sub 0.7/CuO/sub x/ powders. After post-annealingin oxygen for 1h at 930-950{sup 0}C, the films, which were depositedon nimonic alloy substrate heated at 650{sup 0}C during spraying, exhibiteda zero resistance temperature of 90.6K with transition width (90%-10%)of 2K and a critical density (77K,OT) of 690 A/cm/sup 2/.</TEXT></DOC>
