Charles Y. Chang, a former branch chief in the Food and DrugAdministration's Division of Generic Drugs, said special handlingof applications resulted partly from pressure by the larger, moresophisticated companies.   Favoritism, he said, ``was not necessarily the result of illegalbehavior, but reflected, in part, highly personal, arbitrary andoften arrogant management.''   He also referred to examples of special treatment ofapplications and said they ``were the result of continuous pressureput on the division, at all levels, by the industry throughlobbying, conducted by executives, lawyers, consultants, andoccasionally through political channels inside and outside theFDA.''   Chang was charged Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Baltimorewith two counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering. He wasaccused of accepting a free trip to Hong Kong and furniture asbribes from American Therapeutics Inc., a Bohemia, N.Y., genericdrug manufacturer.   Each charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prisonand a $250,000 fine upon conviction.   Another FDA employee and a drug company executive were chargedlast month in the wide-ranging investigation of allegations ofbribery in the generic drugs division. More charges are expected.   Officials in the office of the Inspector General at the Healthand Human Services Department, of which FDA is a part, have saidthere is no indication that impropriety at the agency has resultedin unsafe or ineffective drugs being placed on the market. Changechoed that assessment in his affidavit.   Chang said in the document, dated Tuesday, that he could notdiscuss ``matters under active criminal investigation,'' but saidhe would continue to cooperate with the House Energy and Commerceinvestigations subcommittee, which has been looking into the FDA'sgeneric drug approval process.   The panel released his affidavit at a hearing Wednesday.   In the affidavit, he said favoritism helped speed the processingof applications, usually those of the larger drug manufacturingcompanies. He said he sometimes tried to counteract the specialtreatment by helping to expedite reviews of applications submittedby smaller companies.   Chang said favoritism occurred because of poor management andlax enforcement of the few FDA rules governing reviews of genericdrug applications.   Larry D. Morey, an assistant inspector general at HHS, testifiedthat his office is looking into allegations that 15 FDA employeesreceived subsidized accommodations during meetings in Puerto Ricosponsored by the National Association of PharmaceuticalManufacturers, an association of generic drug companies.   Morey said such subsidies are considered illegal, but he saidthe U.S. attorney's office has declined to prosecute. The resultsof the inspector general's investigation will be referred to theFDA for administrative action, he said. Sanctions could includedismissal, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
