It's really the best way to see the countryside and meetthe people, but couch potatoes had best spend a while getting inshape before setting out on a pedal-power tour.</TEXT><BYLINE>BY JOE McGOWAN Jr.</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SIRMIONE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Imagine days of gliding through scenesfrom Roman antiquity on a bicycle, with midmorning stops forcappuccino, streamside lunches of fresh-baked bread, cheese,prosciutto and wine and evenings in luxurious villas.   Thousands of people, young and old, athlete and couch potato,are finding travel by bicycle an exhilarating way of really seeingthe countryside, talking to people and finding historic or culturallocales rarely available to those speeding through onair-conditioned tour buses.   Many adventurous souls are setting off on bicycle trips on theirown, loading their two-wheelers with clothing, bedrolls andnecessities. Others are letting a tour company make lodgingarrangements, plan an itinerary, schedule meals and provide a vanto haul luggage.   Bicycle tours are available through most European countries,most areas of the United States, Central and South America and eventhe Soviet Union and China.   I and my wife chose one of the most experienced biking andwalking tour operators, Butterfield and Robinson of Toronto, androde from near Milan, Italy, to Venice on a bicycle built for two,a French-made 10-speed tandem. You can ship your own bike or thetour operator will provide custom-made bicycles.   The American Bicycle Federation says the number of bicyclers inthis country increased from 78 million to 88 million since 1985.   It is expected the bicycle craze will spurt again now thatAmerican Greg LeMond has won the prestigious Tour de France.   Several states hold popular cross-state bicycle tours. One ofthe most grueling is the Ride the Rockies tour that this yearcovered 361 miles and went over 11,990-foot Loveland Pass. Tourdirector Paul Balaguer said 3,500 people applied for the tour,which is limited to 2,000.   Our Northern Italy group included 23 Americans _ people from allwalks of life from all parts of the United States. Ages ranged fromabout 30 to the 60s. Tour operators said the eldest to date hadbeen a 78-year-old man.   Some had done nothing more to train for the trip than theirusual tennis or golf game. They also were a little stiff and sorethe first day or two, but that quickly went away. My wife and I hadbicycled about 30 miles on Saturdays and Sundays for two monthsbefore the tour and found the tour a breeze.   Bicycle helmets and biking gloves are strongly recommended andan athletic shoe with a firm sole is a good idea. Otherwise,clothing is left up to the individual. On the tour, attire rangedfrom skin-tight bicycling outfits to shorts, T-shirts and slacks. Alightweight rain jacket is recommended, for chilly mornings andafternoon showers.   Our group gathered in the lobby of a Milan hotel and then it wasoff by bus to Sirmione, on a peninsula on the southern shore ofLake Garda, Italy's largest. At the tip, a modern hydrofoilpassenger boat cruised past the ruins of a Roman spa.   Idling past sidewalk cafes, coffee shops and tourists, the bussqueezed through a narrow passageway at a historic castle, thendeposited our group at the steps of Villa Cortine, the first ofseveral luxurious villas where our palates would be pampered atmulticourse meals and our bodies rested in regal suites.   Our two guides _ Jennifer, a Toronto lawyer, and Nick, whosefuture plans include screenwriting in New York _ showed us ourbicycles and gave us an orientation on safety, including therequired wearing of helmets and a caution against braking hard withonly the front brake (it can throw you over the handlebars).   They discussed the daily routine: breakfast together and then tothe bicycles, which would be checked and ready. The cyclists wereencouraged to set their own pace and see the sights. Some raced offeach morning on optional side trips that saw them travel up to 50miles in a day. Others stopped to take photographs, visit with thenatives, enjoy a cappuccino or espresso and purchase postcards,still completing the average 30 miles a day in time for a swim atthe villa.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
