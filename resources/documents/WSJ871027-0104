I've suffered many, many traumas, many bouts of joblessness, many bouts of being unloved. I'm not very secure socially. I'm always afraid of offending. I'm an incomplete person working against time.    &quot;I guess you couldn't say I'm that Cosmopolitan man.&quot;    This is David Brown, who is known in Hollywood as the producer, with his partner David Zanuck, of &quot;Jaws,&quot; &quot;The Sting,&quot; &quot;The Verdict&quot; and &quot;Cocoon,&quot; and known everywhere else as Cosmopolitan Magazine editor Helen Gurley Brown's husband.    But the balance of fame may shift with the publication of the husband's book, &quot;Brown's Guide to Growing Gray&quot; (Delacorte, 141 pages, $12.95), which aims to help older men cope. There is advice about work (&quot;Start planning your second career while you're still on your first one&quot;); money (&quot;wives of corporation directors who babble indiscreetly at lunch are a rich source of financial information. Listen carefully and buy them another drink&quot;); and psychiatry (&quot;I thought it was for the weaker and more self-obsessed than I&quot;).    But as befits the man who has been married for 28 years to the author of &quot;Sex and the Single Girl,&quot; Mr. Brown, who recently turned 71, devotes most of his guide to the delicate matters of sex, the opposite sex and relationships between the sexes. &quot;People think it's not appropriate to be talking about sex at my age. You sound like an old goat, you're told to knock it off. But it's part of the life force. It's part of being alive,&quot; he says. &quot;You never forget about sexual instincts.&quot;    Indeed, there is hardly a day or an hour when Mr. Brown is not aware of the women in his orbit. &quot;I peer at whatever comely creatures are walking about,&quot; he writes in the chapter titled &quot;Let a woman in your life -- preferably more than one.&quot; &quot;I'm good at looking at women in automobiles, too, and I can get a fix on them before they speed away.&quot;    &quot;Brown's Guide to Growing Gray&quot; used as its role models &quot;How to Be Your Own Best Friend,&quot; and, not surprisingly, &quot;Sex and the Single Girl.&quot; &quot;But people say my book is racier,&quot; says Mr. Brown. It grew out of a conversation with a publisher friend who wanted to know why Mr. Brown was still knocking himself out making movies. &quot;If I didn't,&quot; was the answer, &quot;who would have lunch with me?&quot;    Just whom Mr. Brown is having lunch with is a constant source of feverish concern to his wife. He has a large number of female friends and sometimes has to handle the overflow at breakfast tete-a-tetes, a state of affairs that pleases Mrs. Brown about as much as a dip in Cosmopolitan's circulation. And with the publication of the guide, Mr. Brown will probably have to start making more meal slots available, for example to accommodate the magazine editor who read his book and sent him a letter reflecting on &quot;the lost opportunities I've had.&quot;    But Mr. Brown, while acknowledging that his wife has him on a light rein, knows full well that he's roped and saddled just the same. &quot;There are two sets of rules,&quot; he says, &quot;the rules for the people Helen writes for and the rules for me, and my rules are considerably stricter than the rules for the Cosmo reader.    &quot;People are not allowed to go out with me as a married man in a purely social context. Lunch, fine. The occasional dinner out of town but not too far out of town.    &quot;Every day, no matter where I am around the world, Helen knows who I'm having lunch with. She works it into the conversation. I'll say I'm having lunch at Cote Basque and then for many beats I'll let her hang there, and then she'll say 'with whom,' and then she'll say 'her again?'    &quot;But I've always said Helen has always been the least concerned about the most dangerous women. I'll say `you're worried about so and so when really it's this one that you should think about.' And she'll say 'no, I know the ones to watch out for.'&quot; Still, insists Mr. Brown, there's no deception. &quot;I always announce who I'm having breakfast or lunch with. It's like Russian roulette. You don't know which of them is loaded.&quot;    But because Mrs. Brown doesn't particularly like to watch the progress of the roulette wheel or the meal, certain restaurants are off-limits to her husband. &quot;21 is out because Helen goes there,&quot; he says. &quot;She doesn't like me to take anyone to the Russian Tea Room and she isn't fond of my bringing anyone to Le Cirque. I'm permitted to go to Le Cote Basque and The Four Seasons Grill, where it would be impossible for anything to happen because the tables all face out.    &quot;I don't care if she goes to any of those places,&quot; adds Mr. Brown, who calculates that he's currently carrying on four liaisons of unspecified nature. &quot;But I like to be warned. I don't like to be surprised as I was once at La Caravelle. Not that anything's going on but it's intimidating. When there's a lull in the conversation you look over and she's peering at you. One feels the presence of an authority figure.&quot;    Possibly because Mrs. Brown usually has lunch at her desk, Mr. Brown doesn't worry about her and other men, &quot;but maybe I should,&quot; he says. &quot;Sometimes I find myself humming 'I guess I'll have to change my plan/I never thought that there would be another man.'&quot;    Meanwhile, back at her desk, Mrs. Brown says she has barely a minute of indigestion worrying about David at La Caravelle or David at Le Cote Basque or David in Seattle. &quot;He's running around the country talking about his girlfriends and I wonder if he's doing more serious things than I can glean,&quot; she laughs. &quot;He's getting frisky out there with his book. But I like the fact that he's good with women because that means he's good with me.&quot;    If Helen Gurley Brown has her rules, David Brown has his. Rules like confess nothing, admit nothing. Barbara Walters once ordered him to look her in the eye and say whether he'd ever been unfaithful to his wife. &quot;I wouldn't dream of answering a question like that. It's far too personal. Gary Hart should have taken lessons from me,&quot; says Mr. Brown, who until recently fantasized about the perfect spot for a risk-free assignation. &quot;But there is no safe place anymore,&quot; he mourns. &quot;There's no place to hide anymore. We're all on closed-circuit television.    &quot;My wife couldn't bear scrutiny. I couldn't bear scrutiny,&quot; he continues. &quot;Jimmy Carter wasn't the only one who lusted in his heart. What Helen is applauding is that there's a discussion of this nature taking place in my 72nd year and in her 65th.&quot;    The discussion will, no doubt, continue. Mr. Brown turns to a reporter. &quot;We should have lunch,&quot; he says.    ---   Ms. Kaufman is a free-lance writer based in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
