Police said they arrested about 600 people in Seoul but had nofigure on injuries.   The street battles in Seoul followed a two-hour rally, in which3,000 radical students and labor activists called for the overthrowof the Roh government and revision of laws they argue restrictlabor movements.   The protesters staged the rally at the state-run Seoul NationalUniversity in southern Seoul after authorities banned theirgathering at a public park. During the rally, they vowed to fightfor a ``victory of the 10 million workers'' in South Korea.   ``We will overcome whatever difficulties and win back our justrights,'' Dan Byong-ho, chief organizer of the rally said asfollowers cheered.   Dan, head of a newly organized dissident labor organization, theNational Federation of Labor Unions, accused the Roh government ofsuppressing labor movements as part of its effort to hold ontopower.   Dan said his group's aim is to fight only for higher salariesand better working conditions but authorities said they suspect thegroup is led by pro-North Korean elements. Officials said the laborrally Sunday could pose a threat to social order.   Fierce street battles broke out near Shinsegye Department Storeand East Gate in downtown Seoul where 300 to 500 protesters foughtpolice for several hours with rocks and firebombs in a dense fog oftear gas.   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' protesters shouted as they chargedpolice with rocks and firebombs.   Armored police vans fired volleys of tear gas to disperse theprotesters, who regrouped in alleys and charged back repeatedly.Some demonstrators were caught and beaten up by police.   About 3,000 police were deployed in Seoul to protect keygovernment offices and public installations.   Shoppers and pedestrians covered their faces with handkerchiefsto beat back the acrid tear gas. Streets were littered with rocksand fragments from tear gas canisters.   In Pusan, the nation's second largest city on the south coast,about 500 students, workers and dissident school teachers clashedwith police after a rally, during which they denounced thegovernment for backing away from its promise for democratic reforms.
