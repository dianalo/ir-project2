(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors argued Thursday that a county'sproblems do not excuse two people from taking hostages at anewspaper, but the defense said Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobssaw no alternative.   ``Conceding an argument that there are serious problems inRobeson County that need to be addressed, that does not excuse theaction taken here,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bruce.   ``We're not saying that because there were problems in the past(in Robeson County) that this was a violent protest,'' countereddefense lawyer Lewis Pitts, one of Jacobs' attorneys. ``That's whatthe government would like you to think, but it ignores the real andimmediate threat to Timothy Jacobs and Eddie Hatcher.''   The arguments were held before a federal jury began itsdeliberations in the case at 3:50 p.m. after more than an hour ofinstructions from U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle.   After about 45 minutes of deliberations, jurors asked for andreceived definitions for ``knowingly,'' ``willfully'' and``maliciously.'' They deliberated until 5 p.m. and were to resumeFriday.   Hatcher, 30, and Jacobs, 20, both Tuscarora Indians fromPembroke, face charges of making and possessing illegal firearms,conspiring to make those weapons and making a bomb threat. Afederal charge of hostage-taking was dismissed earlier this weekagainst Jacobs but remains against Hatcher.   The defendants have argued that their lives were in jeopardybecause of information they had linking law enforcement officers todrug trafficking in Robeson County. They claimed they had to takehostages at The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton to publicizetheir case and save their lives.   The two held as many as 20 people during their 10-hour siege onFeb. 1. No one was injured.   The judge rejected a request by defense attorneys Wednesday todiscuss self-defense in his instructions to the jury, which willfollow closing arguments.   ``Can you imagine 60,000 frightened, abandoned people cryingout?'' Hatcher appealed to the jury in a closing statement partlywritten by his attorney, William Kunstler. ``From 150 miles away,they're crying out. Some are faint, they're tired, they're woreout. Please don't abandon me and Timmy.''   Kunstler could not appear at the trial because he is tied up ina New York case.   ``Mr. Bruce talked about the Constitution this morning and howit allows peaceful protest,'' Hatcher said. ``When those sworn touphold the Constitution won't, what do you do?''   Hatcher's voice cracked and began to quaver, bringing sobs fromhis supporters in the courtroom and tears to Jacobs and his defenseattorneys, who were seated opposite the jury.   But Bruce said, ``If everything in this whole scenario they havespun out is true, it still does not justify their putting innocentpeople in terror of their lives.''   Pitts said taking hostages was ``a drastic action'' he was nottrying to minimize, but that the intentions of Hatcher and Jacobswere critical to the case.   ``If you put aside the fear and impact on the individuals (atthe newspaper), what it comes down to is if they had a guilty mindor evil intent,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
