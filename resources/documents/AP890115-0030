The article in the latest edition of Ogonyok magazine said,however, that the total number of Soviet suicides had peaked in 1984and is now dropping, a change it credited to the anti-drinking drivechampioned by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   In contrast, suicides among Soviet children are on the increase,Ogonyok said.   Ogonyok's study on Soviet suicide _ titled ``The Final Step'' _was a dramatic illustration of the greater frankness in Soviet mediafostered by Gorbachev's campaign for ``glasnost,'' or greateropenness.   Statistics on suicide, as well as other demographic data on theSoviet population, were once treated as state secrets and notmentioned by state-run media.   Official data on Soviet suicides were published in the 1920s bythe government's Department on Moral Statistics, but the agency wasabolished by dictator Josef V. Stalin in the 1930s.   Ogonyok said statistics on Soviet suicides were revealed onlyseveral weeks ago. In 1984, it said, 81,417 Soviets killedthemselves.   By comparison, 29,286 Americans committed suicide that year,according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.   In 1985, the year Gorbachev raised the drinking age from 18 to21, increased the price of vodka and cut alcohol production, thenumber of Soviet suicides dropped to 68,073, the magazine said.   Ogonyok said many suicide attempts were the result of drunkenness.   In 1986, there were 52,830 suicides in the Soviet Union, and54,105 in 1987, Ogonyok said.   U.S. figures for those years were not available. However,according to Centers for Disease Control statistics, the U.S.suicide rate rose from 11.9 suicides per 100,000 people in 1980 to12.8 per 100,000 in 1986.   Ogonyok did not give the Soviet suicide rate, but anotherpublication, Arguments and Facts, reported in June that the nationalsuicide rate was ``around'' 20 per 100,000, which works out toapproximately 56,000 suicides a year.   Ogonyok said the number of suicides among young children andteen-agers was ``growing much more rapidly'' than among the Sovietadult population, but it did not give statistics.   It said in most cases, parents and teachers cannot explain whychildren who appear healthy and happy would take their own lives. Itsaid they seemed to put some of the blame on the privations ofSoviet life, which may affect children more than adults.   ``If they (adults) try hard, they even get used to the fact thatthey can't buy books in bookstores,'' Ogonyok said. ``To teach thisto children is even harder.''</TEXT></DOC>
