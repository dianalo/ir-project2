As previously reported, Pay 'N Pak, a Kent, Wash., retailer, on Monday accepted a management group's $212.5 million leveraged-buyout proposal, composed of $17 in cash for each share plus preferred stock valued by the company at $4.25 a share. The preferred is to pay a 17% annual dividend in stock.    Mr. Bilzerian's subsequent offer on Tuesday, as previously reported, was $17 cash for each Pay 'N Pak share plus a preferred share valued at $5 and paying a 16% annual dividend in either stock or cash. Mr. Bilzerian later increased that dividend to match the management group's offer and facilitate a comparison. &quot;It should have been part of our original offer,&quot; he said, adding that he hadn't seen the Tuesday proposal before it was sent to the retailer because he was traveling.    Pay 'N Pak officials couldn't be reached for comment.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
