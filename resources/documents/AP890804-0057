West Berlin's government, headed by the Social Democrats in acoalition with the environmentalist Alternative List, proposes that36 daily flights be eliminated from Tegel Airport's schedule,spokesman Werner Kolhoff said Friday.   Kolhoff told the radio station Sender Freies Berlin that theplan, which would cut commercial air traffic by about 15 percent,is aimed at cutting down on noise and exhaust emissions fromjetliners servicing West Berlin.   Horst Wagner, West Berlin's transportation minister, says thatwhile the number of commercial flights increased 23.6 percent in1988 from the previous year, the number of passengers increasedonly 6.2 percent in the same period.   Die Welt, the conservative daily, said ``low-load'' flightswould be affected by the reduction, meaning flights that do notnormally carry many passengers.   The United States, Britain and France formally administer WestBerlin under post-World War II agreements and would have to approvethe proposal. The federal government also must be consulted.   The three Allied air attaches probably will meet with WestBerlin and federal officials next week to discuss the matter, saidan Allied official in Bonn, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Herbert Schmuelling, a federal government spokesman, said thecut in flights could run counter to the Berlin Initiative of formerPresident Ronald Reagan, who while he was in office called forimproved access to the divided city.   Schmuelling said air traffic ``is the only uncontrolled accessto the city'' and that a major reduction of flights would have a``pyschological'' effect on residents of the Western enclavesurrounded by East Germany.   Eduard Lintner, a federal lawmaker with Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sChristian Democratic Union, said the proposal sends a ``dangeroussignal'' and would be a serious setback for the city.   Rudolf Kraus, a leading official with the Christian SocialUnion, Kohl's Bavarian sister party, said the plan ``bears theclear signature of the alternatives (Alternative List), who want toturn Berlin into an island uncoupled from the Federal Republic.''   Allied civil air officials based in Bonn said the Allied civilair attaches ``must weigh the needs of the traveling public and theBerlin population as well as commercial and practical aviationconsiderations.   ``The Allies intend to ensure that the high quality of aviationservices in Berlin will be maintained and that measures to protectthe Berlin environment will be implemented as appropriate,'' theofficials said.   People can also reach West Berlin by vehicle and by train, whichmust pass through East German border control points.   Officials say about 7,000 flights in and out of West Berlin arescheduled every month, averaging about 220 a day. Flights in Junehad about 400,000 passengers.</TEXT></DOC>
