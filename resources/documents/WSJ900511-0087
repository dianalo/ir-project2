Reps. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Edward Markey (D.,Mass.) also asked the agency to brief them on the impact ofthe ruling by an appeals court panel, which overturned theinsider-trading conviction of Robert Chestman, a formerGruntal andamp; Co. broker.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Chestman had been convicted in federal district courtof insider trading in Waldbaum Inc. stock before the companywas acquired by Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co. The appealscourt ruling threatened to throw into turmoil the SEC's useof its Rule 14e-3 in insider-trading cases. The rule makes ita violation to trade on misappropriated tender-offerinformation even if the defendant isn't violating a fiduciaryduty by making the trade.   The government hasn't decided whether it will appeal thelatest ruling to the full appeals court or the Supreme Court.   Legislation to restore any authority the SEC may have lostas a result of the court action could include devising astatutory definition of insider-trading, something Rep.Dingell has opposed in the past.</TEXT></DOC>
