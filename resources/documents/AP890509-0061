Arkin made the comment after releasing evidence about a 1965accident in which the Navy lost a bomb-bearing aircraft and itspilot 80 miles off Japan's Okinawa island chain.   Japan on Monday formally requested an explanation fromWashington about the 1965 accident.   ``This happened in international waters so we have no right tomake a loud demand,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry official whodeclined to be named. ``We are just asking the United States togive us an explanation.''   The research Arkin did with the environmentalist Greenpeacegroup concluded that the United States and Soviet Union havelittered the ocean floor with at least 48 nuclear weapons and 11nuclear reactors.   Two days after the airplane fell off the elevator of the USSTiconderoga, the aircraft carrier docked at the Japanese port ofYokosuka, Arkin said.   Arkin asserted Monday the United States sidesteps the Japaneseban by arguing a temporary transit or port call by a ship does notamount to the ``introduction'' of nuclear weapons.   A Japanese Embassy official in Washington said Monday oncondition of anonymity: ``It is our understanding that we wouldreceive prior consultation with the United States before U.S.forces bring nuclear weapons to Japan. So if there has been noconsultation, we assume there has been no introduction of nuclearweapons.''   The Navy declined comment on the findings, saying it refuses toconfirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons in specificlocations.   Arkin and Joshua Handler, a Greenpeace member who helped preparethe report, said their research showed a different version ofevents from the one given by the Navy in 1981 when it disclosed theincident.   The Navy said in a statement then that the incident took place``more than 500 miles from land ... at sea in the Pacific.''   Arkin and Handler said log books kept by deck officers showedthat the accident occurred in international waters about 80 milesfrom the closest point of the Okinawa island chain and only about200 miles east of the heavily populated island of Okinawa.   The accident is considered by the Navy to be one of its two mostsevere mishaps involving nuclear devices. The second such ``BrokenArrow,'' as the incidents are called, was the 1968 loss of thesubmarine Scorpion in the Atlantic.   At the time of the Ticonderoga accident, Okinawa was under U.S.control. It was returned to Japan in 1972, 27 years after Japan'sdefeat in World War II in which atomic bombs were dropped onHiroshima and Nagasaki.   The ship had been returning from bombing missions off the coastof Vietnam. Although only conventional bombs were used in Vietnam,a newly declassified memo obtained by Arkin said the Ticonderoga atthe time was to have ``the capability to launch a nuclear strikewhen and where directed by the president.''   Arkin said there was little danger of detonation from theone-megaton bomb, which has a force of one million tons of TNT,although he said the 15 kilograms of plutonium in the bomb couldthreaten the environment as it deteriorates over time.   ``Over time, the pressure, water circulation and corrosion arelikely to lead to the release of radioactivity,'' he said.   The Japanese government does not know the present location andcondition of the bomb and there have been no discussions with theUnited States about how to deal with it, sai a Japanese ForeignMinistry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Most of the warheads and reactors lost at sea belonged to theSoviet Union, according to Greenpeace data.   The most recent Soviet loss was a Mike class submarine with twonuclear reactors aboard off the coast of Norway that sank April 7,said Handler.   The most serious loss was a Soviet Yankee class submarine thatsank Oct. 6, 1986, off the coast of Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean.Yankee-class subs are believed to carry 16 SS-N-6 ballisticmissiles, with two warheads apiece, and to be powered by twonuclear reactors, according to Western defense analysts.   The report, which first came out over the weekend, wasprominently featured in Japanese newspapers and on television.Leaders of anti-war and anti-nuclear groups and opponents of theU.S. military presence on Okinawa immediately issued denunciations.</TEXT></DOC>
