A third person died of heart failure during the clashes, andthree people believed to be ethnic Turks were injured, BTA said.   Turkish newspapers reported today that 25 ethnic Turks werekilled in the clashes, which occurred in northeastern Bulgaria,where most of the country's 900,000 ethnic Turks live.   The unrest Saturday and Sunday appeared to be some of the worstethnic violence since the early 1980s, when Bulgaria's Communistauthorities restricted the Moslem religion, banned public use ofthe Turkish language and tried to force ethnic Turks to adoptBulgarian-sounding names.   In Ankara, Turkey, Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu toldreporters the government had formally asked Bulgaria forinformation about the unrest.   In addition to the village of Todor Ikonomovo, where theshooting deaths occurred, riots also broke out in some areas of theregions of Razgrad and Varna, according to BTA.   Foreign diplomats said they also heard reports of clashesbetween ethnic Turks and security forces in Dulovo and Kaolinovo,in northeastern Bulgaria.   An emigre source in Vienna, Austria, said fatalities occurred inthose regions when police and troops opened fire on protesters.   Authorities moved in tanks and helicopters after the clashes inRazgrad, a diplomat said. Communications to the city were cut.   ``Extremist-minded individuals, some under the influence ofalcohol, committed a gross violation of peace and tried to drawgroups of the population into acts of lawless violence,'' BTA said.   It said that ``despite numerous appeals to abide by the law, agroup led by extremist elements attacked and ill-treated civilservants _ police officers included,'' in Todor Ikonomovo, about190 miles east of Sofia, the capital.   ``An attempt to break into the village people's council andseize the arms kept there resulted in a confrontation,'' accordingto the report.   It said security forces fired warning shots, and the casualtiesoccurred when bullets bounced off the pavement and hit protesters.   A man died during riots in the town of Kaolinovo, and a postmortem found that heart failure was the cause of death, the newsagency reported.   An emigre source said the clash in Kaolinovo was prompted by apetition that four ethnic Turks sent to Parliament last monthurging that the minority's ethnic rights be restored. The sourcesaid the four were arrested May 1 and punished with labor on statefarms.   Bulgarian authorities do not recognize the existence of aTurkish minority in the country.   BTA blamed the disturbances on ``inaccurate information providedby some local authorities'' on recently liberalized travel laws,which allegedly created ``misunderstandings among certain strata ofthe population.''   The new measures, passed by the federal Parliament this month,make it easier for the country's 8.9 million citizens to get apassport and journey abroad. They also apparently make it easierfor Bulgarian citizens to emigrate.   The official report did not exactly how the alleged``misunderstandings'' of the travel laws gave rise to the unrest.      Emigre sources in Vienna said a protest hunger strike among theethnic Turks, which started May 6, had spread to several parts ofBulgaria and involved up to 300 people at a time.   Groups of people were reported taking turns in the fast for afew days to publicize the plight of the Turkish minority prior to ahuman rights conference starting in Paris May 30.   Turkey ruled Bulgaria for 500 years before 1863 and there is along history of conflict. Periodic unrest has been reported since1984 in ethnic Turkish areas. Reports of growing protest havecirculated among diplomats in Sofia for at least a month.</TEXT></DOC>
