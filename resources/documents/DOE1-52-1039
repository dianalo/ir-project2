Establishes that relationship between gas emission rates andcoal permeability is nonmonotonic. With gas pressure less than 1.5 MPainitial gas emission rate does not exceed 5 l/min, and routine measurementsdo not detect increases in coal and gas outburst tendencies. With gaspressure above 4 MPa, initial gas emission rates exceed 5 l/min and routineforecasting always indicates hazardous conditions. 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
