SullivanandM;Boosting the distances supported between LAN connections, IMC Networks Corp.andO;introduced Ethernet network interface cards earlier this month that utilizefiber-optic wiring.andP;  The firm also announced an Ethernet repeater and mediumattachment unit to round out its PCnic family of Ethernet products.andM;The fiber-optic Ethernet cards for Micro Channel and AT-bus computers, calledPCnic II FO and PCnic FO, respectively, connect LANs at distances up to 1kilometer, said Jan Morrison, director of marketing communications for IMC inTustin, Calif.andP;  Each bus type will be available in two flavors: a $695workstation model with 16K bytes of memory, and a $725 file server versionwith 64K bytes of memory.andM;The AT version is scheduled for release in January.andP;  IMC has not set arelease date for the Micro Channel card, Morrison said.andM;Fiber offers immunity from electrical interference, but because fiber iscostly to install, twisted-pair Ethernet is still the preferred wiringoption, said David Terrie, president of Newport Consulting in Scituate, Mass.andO;Twisted-pair and coaxial cabling typically support distances between a wiringcloset and a LAN node of up to 300 feet, he said.andM;IMC's new Ethernet repeater, the PCnic Basket+, allows users to connect asmany as 12 workstations to an Ethernet backbone over fiber-optic, unshieldedtwisted-pair or thin coaxial cabling.andP;  Workstations are linked to therepeater through Port Interface Cards (PICs).andM;The base PCnic Basket+ system is priced at $995 and includes a power supply,a six-slot mainboard for connecting the port interface cards, one AUI (thickcoaxial) port and one BNC (thin coaxial) port.andP;  PCnic Basket+ will beavailable in January.andM;Available at the end of January, the dual-ported Coaxial PIC will be pricedat $450; the dual-ported TP PIC will be $195, and each FO PIC will be $495.andM;Also in January, IMC will begin shipping the $139 TP MAU, a medium attachmentunit designed to provide IEEE 802.3 10BaseT compatibility with any Ethernetdevice.andM;IMC Networks can be reached at (714) 259-1020.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
