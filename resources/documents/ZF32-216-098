Since many personal taxprograms are used only once by one person, designers must make the softwareeasy enough to use that the taxpayer needn't invest hours thumbing throughmanuals or running thick/extensive tutorials.andM;That quest for (relative) simplicity is the theme that runs through many ofthis year's tax software upgrades.andP;  Almost all of the programs we've reviewedhave added pull-down menus, pop-up windows, on-screen calculators, and somedegree of on-screen help with the mechanical operations of the program.andP;  Onepackage even stakes a claim for tax prep software in the brave new graphicalworld of Windows 3.0.andM;The real winners are the programs that do more than simply provide a tool tomake sure you get the arithmetic right (no mean feat for humans, though itshould be a snap for the PC).andP;  The best of the breed take a coherentapproach, adding new features and working thoughtfully to make the wholeprocess easier for you.andP;  They harness the PC's power to tell you what youneed to know--exactly when you need to know it.andP;  That includes help not onlywith software mechanics but also with substantive tax points.andM;Interestingly, the Internal Revenue Service has made at least one policychange that benefits users of all of the software reviewed here.andP;  The IRS hasrelented on its previous insistence that you file your return on anear-perfect replica of its own printed Form 1040.andP;  It now accepts a typedversion, provided it meets IRS standards for underlining and legibility, asall of the programs that we review here do.andM;If you believe firmly that neatness counts, however, you may feel morecomfortable with the options in several programs for reproducing a graphicsprintout of a 1040.andP;  Some of these look like dot matrix output, even whencoming from a laser printer, while others generate a form that only an expertcould tell apart from real IRS issue.andM;EDITORS' CHOICEandM;* Turbo TaxandM;* Andrew Tobias' TaxCutandM;This year, two programs stand out for their sheer intelligence and good sensein anticipating your needs as your plow  through your yearly staring contestwith the form 1040.andP;  Andrew Tobias' TaxCut, from Meca Software, and TurboTax,from ChipSoft, concentrate on simplifying operations and makingunderstandable tax assistance available where and where you want it.andP;  Nowonder that last year TaxCut sold over 100,000 copies and TurboTax sold overa quarter of a million copies.andP;  Nobody else comes close.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
