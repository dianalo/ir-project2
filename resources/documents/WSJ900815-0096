In recommending a penalty, the commission'sstaff said the company's president, Douglas McCrary, &quot;shouldhave known&quot; about Gulf's problems sooner and taken quickeraction.   John Hutchinson, a Gulf spokesman, said the Pensacola,Fla.-based company believes that the penalty is&quot;unwarranted,&quot; noting that &quot;. . . no management system in theworld can prevent an individual from committing illegalacts.&quot; He said Gulf may appeal the ruling in court.   Separately, two special agents with the Internal RevenueService filed suit against Gulf Power in federal court lastweek, alleging the company conducted illegal credit checks onthem in an effort to discredit their investigation of Gulf.It was the IRS investigation that led to Gulf's guilty plealast fall. The IRS continues to examine the actions ofindividuals involved in the political contributions scheme.   Mr. Hutchinson acknowledged that &quot;someone&quot; at Gulf hadrequested the credit checks, which he said were not made forthe usual purpose of verifying credit before extending creditfor appliances sold by Gulf. He said, &quot;We don't know who didit, but we know Jake Horton was in charge of the appliancedivision through which it (the credit checks) was ordered.&quot;   Jacob F. &quot;Jake&quot; Horton, a former senior vice president atGulf, has emerged as a central figure in the illegalpolitical contributions scheme. He died in a mysterious crashof a corporate plane in April 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
