(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Saying ``what's passed has passed,''defrocked evangelist Jimmy Swaggart ended his three-month exilefrom the pulpit but conceded that not everyone will forgive him forhis sins with a prostitute.   ``I am sure there will be many ... that will see to it that Idon't forget. I realize it will be the hardest task,'' Swaggartsaid Sunday.   In his first sermon since tearfully confessing on Feb. 21 tounspecified sins, the television evangelist reclaimed his pulpitwith fire-and-brimstone fervor before 5,000 followers.   ``Once you look up into his (God's) face, you will never be anycleaner than you are right now,'' Swaggart said.   ``I want to serve notice on the whole world: What's passed haspassed.   ``Even looking back is not fit. I am reaching forward for thosethings that are before. I am serving notice on demons and devilsand hell _ the best is yet to come!'' he shouted.   His initial appearance at the pulpit drew a polite response, butas he preached, the congregation became more enthusiastic and gavehim several loud, standing ovations.   Swaggart, stripped of his credentials as an Assemblies of Godminister, returned after a three-month suspension originallyordered by an Assemblies' state council.   National leaders of the Pentecostal denomination defrocked himin April after he refused to accept a sterner banishment of atleast one year from the pulpit for a reported encounter with aprostitute, Debra Murphree, who says Swaggart paid her to pose nudefor him at a New Orleans motel.   Marvin Gorman, a defrocked minister who claims in a lawsuit thatSwaggart ruined his ministry by spreading false stories aboutadulterous affairs, reportedly hired private detectives tophotograph Swaggart outside the motel.   After a Sunday service at his Metropolitan Christian Center insuburban New Orleans, Gorman said Swaggart needs to fast and pray.   ``I would hope he is already doing that, but if he hasn't, therewill be no way he can make it through the battles not only he hasfaced, but he will be facing in the future,'' Gorman said.   A group of former Swaggart followers, meanwhile, gathered in aBaton Rouge hotel ballroom for the service of Cross Fire Assembly,an Assemblies of God church formed by ministers who recently leftSwaggart's ministry.   Worshiper Ed Paradela said Swaggart's departure from thedenomination led him to change churches.   `If Swaggart would have really repented, he would have reallybeen obedient to the Assemblies of God,'' he said.   Swaggart told congregants at his Family Worship Center that hestill carried the word of God.   ``God called me as a child. I love him more than life itself. Heis my life ... You might want to say that call is abrogated. But Iknow better.''   Swaggart did not talk about the specifics of his sin, referringto the revelation and the problems that beset the ministryafterward as ``this thing.''   ``This ministry is in God's hands,'' he said. ``If he sees fitfor me to sweep floors ... at a little mission across the tracks, Iwould be honored to do so for the rest of my life.''   Swaggart said that only God could heal a sinner and overcome theguilt that follows sin.   ``Guilt is one of Satan's greatest weapons ... Psychiatrydoesn't have an answer for it, psychology doesn't have an answerfor it. Therapy does not have an answer for it,'' he said.   ``The blood of Jesus Christ is not a treatment. It is a cure,''Swaggart shouted as he pounded on a large speaker on the podium.   Before ushers passed the offering plate, Swaggart referred toreports that his worldwide ministry is in financial trouble.Swaggart recently appealed for $6 million, and three major cabletelevision networks have canceled his programs.   ``For every dollar we get, we spend a dollar and a dime and wespend it before we get it because the world needs to hear thegospel of Jesus Christ,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
