Wind shear, one of the most dangerous weather conditions encountered by pilots, is a sudden change in wind speed or direction, and can cause an aircraft to stall or lose altitude rapidly. It is especially hazardous at low altitudes, when pilots have little room to maneuver.    Over the past decade, wind shear has contributed to at least five airline accidents, resulting in 500 deaths, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. One of the worst accidents occurred in 1985 when a Delta Air Lines jet crashed at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, killing 137 people. Another was in 1982, when 153 people were killed as a Pan American World Airways plane crashed at Kenner, La.    In announcing the new rule, Transportation Secretary James Burnley said, &quot;Experience has shown that pilots can recover successfuly from wind-shear encounters if they can recognize the situation quickly enough and have sufficient information to execute escape maneuvers.&quot;    In addition to warning pilots when they hit unexpected, low-altitude wind shear, the new required equipment will provide the crew with computer-generated instructions on the best path to take to escape the wind shear. It doesn't predict when planes will encounter wind shear.    About 3,600 planes currently in use and those built in the future will be covered by the rule. Under the new rule, airlines must equip half their aircraft within 27 months from the date the rule is published in the Federal Register, which is expected to be Monday. Three-quarters of the planes must be equipped within 39 months, and all must be equipped within 51 months of the rule's publication.    Wind-shear equipment costs $30,000 to $35,000 a plane, plus a further $10,000 to $15,000 for installation. The rule also requires airlines to provide flight crews with both ground-school and simulator training in recognizing and escaping from wind shear.    Airlines that operate planes with fewer than 30 seats needn't install the equipment, but will be required to provide wind-shear training to their flight crews.    The FAA also is working on the development of a better ground-based wind-shear detection system and improved dissemination of weather information around airports to pilots. In addition, the agency is working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on a research program for a system that would spot wind shear ahead, allowing pilots to avoid it. </TEXT></DOC>
