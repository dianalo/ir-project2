Barney Frank said Monday on why Congress did little in responseto the warnings.   Problems at HUD were outlined in dozens of reports by theagency's inspector general and the General Accounting Office, theinvestigative arm of Congress.   ``Congressional staffs just aren't big enough and members ofCongress just don't have enough time,'' said Frank, D-Mass., amember of two committees that oversee HUD programs. ``These peopleat HUD just didn't care about the programs so we had to spend mostof our time just trying to keep the programs from being destroyed.''   Many of the statements found in the reports now seem prophetic,warning of problems now under congressional scrutiny, includinginfluence-peddling, poorly targeted programs and millions of dollarsin missing funds.   ``Project selections had been based upon political considerationrather than merit,'' the GAO's John H. Luke told Congress in October1984, at one of the few hearings held to explore problems at HUD.Luke was testifying about revised loan policies for housing for theelderly and handicapped.   The changes, he said, ``reduced accountability and in turn limitsthe department's ability to explain and defend its decisions.''   New HUD Secretary Jack Kemp last week suspended one of thedepartment's elderly housing programs because 30 percent of theprojects had resulted in foreclosures. Many of the projects had lowoccupancy rates, which an internal audit blamed on HUD for approvinglarge developments despite warnings the area housing market wouldnot support them.   In January 1984, three years into the Reagan administration, theGAO criticized the management style of then-HUD Secretary SamuelPierce in a report to Congress. The report said Pierce delegatedmost decision-making and did not establish a centralized managementprocess to keep track of his deputies.   Congress now is investigating allegations that politicalinfluence played a role in major HUD project awards and thatpolitical appointees often overruled career agency officials inawarding HUD funds.   A high turnover rate among the agency's brass also weakened HUDmanagement, the GAO warned.   Many of those now facing congressional scrutiny are former HUDofficials who became private real estate developers or consultants _and profited in their new jobs by winning HUD work.   The GAO management study also said HUD had trouble tracking itsmoney because most of its accounting was done by hand. Most of thesystems that had been automated were obsolete, the report said.   HUD's inspector general audited private escrow agents hired bythe agency to handle sales and acquisitions of property, and foundthe agents often were late paying HUD its money _ and in some casesdid not pay at all. The agency didn't know about most of the lapsesbecause of poor accounting, the audits said.   Testimony to a House subcommittee investigating HUD has indicatedthat many major decisions were made by Pierce's top aide, DeborahGore Dean, who had no previous experience in housing but hadconsiderable contacts with influential Republicans.   Congress also is investigating the awarding of HUD money toprojects that, while qualified, were not ranked as priority programs.   ``We found that some applications with low project points werefunded,'' the GAO said in a March 1985 report that reviewed theselection process used to award HUD's coveted Urban DevelopmentAction Grants.   Another report sent to Congress in April 1988 said surplus fundsreceived by public housing agencies were used to pay for officefurniture, softball uniforms, birthday cards, holiday parties andexercise equipment.   One such agency, GAO said, used $76,000 to buy equipment and paytravel expenses for a drum and bugle corps to represent the agencyat parades and other festivities.   The GAO said the HUD official in charge of the program was awaresome of the funds were not spent on housing but opposed efforts toestablish guidelines on how the money could be spent.</TEXT></DOC>
