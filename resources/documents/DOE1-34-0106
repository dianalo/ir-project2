Through the analyses onthe change of airborne particle counts along time, we, in this paper,proposed the Potential Number of Air Change as the indicator of effectiveventilation power of clean zone. Using this indicator, some relationshipbetween operating conditions and the performance of clean rooms weremade clear.</TEXT></DOC>
