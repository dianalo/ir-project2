Tenor Placido Domingo, singing in Nauhatl, will star in thepremiere of Lalo Schifrin's ``Songs of the Aztecs'' on the stonestage of the Square of the Moon, built centuries ago by ancientMeso-Americans.   Schifrin will conduct the Mexico Philharmonic at the Oct. 29event, a benefit to launch a campaign for the restoration of theAztec Temple of Teotihuacan, an hour's drive from Mexico City.American Express has pledged $100,000 toward the restoration.   The composer said doing an opera in Nauhatl was not a seriousproblem. ``The chorus and singers are used to the phonetics of aforeign language,'' he said.   ``I thought it would be better to do it in the original language.With a translation, the use of a dictionary and grammar, I was ableto work it out. Chocolatl was a secret drink of the Aztecs. We saychocolate. Our word coyote comes from their coyotetl.''   He was helped by a Nauhatl authority, Dr. Georges Beaudo of theUniversity of Toulouse in France.   Schifrin wrote the music after finding some pre-Columbian poetry,in Spanish, by Nezahualcoyotl (1432-72).   ``(It) was so beautiful I decided to use it,'' he said. ``Thelast line of the poem is, `It cannot be in vain why we come to thisEarth; let us leave some flowers; let us leave some songs.'''   For the Oct. 29 performance, 10,000 chairs will be set up, a newsound system built and TV screens put in to provide subtitles inSpanish and English. ``We're trying to make some of the prices verypopular,'' he said. ``A thousand people are going to pay very, veryhigh prices. I cannot tell you how much money it takes to presevesomething that is very important. ... To know where we're comingfrom is going to help us to know where we're going.''   The pyramids at Teotihuacan date from 100 B.C. to 100 A.D.   The site of the concert, Schifrin said, is in the City of theGods in a square of stone, the Square of the Moon.   ``The square is raised; it's exactly the place for the fullsymphony, full chorus, soloists and conductor, where musicians usedto play 500 years ago,'' he said. ``It was a stage; they built itfor us. Along a stone avenue are ruins of temples and stairways. Thewhole place looks very impressive. We go to Greece and Rome to findarchitectural riches but we have it right here.''   That Schifrin is the composer of so esoteric a work may surprisethose who know him either from his jazz days with Dizzy Gillespie oras a composer of more than 80 film and TV scores.   Schifrin, who is 56, was born in Buenos Aires, where his fatherwas concertmaster of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic. He studiedcomposition and piano at the Paris Conservatory, and returned toBuenos Aires where he became a composer, arranger, conductor andpianist, in pop, jazz and classical music.   ``I've seen opera since I was a child. I had a dramatic instinct.This is probably one of the first times I'm saying this openly but Ithink movies are the opera of today,'' he said.   ``In `The Cincinnati Kid,' where I had Ray Charles playing alongwith a symphony orchestra, it was not pop music. This was reallyserious music _ to me, and I think to many people.   ``The score of `Bullitt' is being played by symphony orchestrasnow. I did an arrangement of symphonic sketches from the score of`Cool Hand Luke.'''   He moved to the United States in 1958 and played piano inGillespie's quintet from 1960-62. He composed ``Gillespiana Suite''for the first record he on which he played with Dizzy.   ``Many people think I went to Hollywood to make money,'' shesaid. ``I didn't have any idea about how much money I was going tomake. There is a group of composers in New York and there is nooutlet to play their music. Duke Ellington was the only examplesince Haydn to have his own orchestra to play his own music. Thereason I went to Hollywood was, there was an outlet for hearing yourmusic you composed.''   Lately, he has done less film composing and more conducting. LastDecember, he became music director of the Paris Philharmonic. Theirfirst recording together, Ravel's ``Mother Goose,'' Stravinsky's``Petrushka'' and Schifrin's double bass concerto with soloist GaryKarr, is being released this fall.   ``I think music is to be shared, and not only through mechanicalmeans like records. You can be in a theater or even a stadium, doingsomething for several thousand people. That is very thrilling.''</TEXT></DOC>
