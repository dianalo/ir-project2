The suspension, requested by the West German government after theDec. 8 accident at Remscheid, will block military flight trainingbelow altitudes of roughly 10,700 feet.   ``The suspension will remain in effect until Jan. 2, 1989, atwhich point fighter training will resume,'' the Pentagon added inreleasing a joint communique from the four NATO allies.   In a related matter, the U.S. Air Force on Monday deniednewspaper reports that American soldiers used force to keep localresidents and a news reporter away from the scene of last week'scrash.   The accident involved an Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt II jet thatslammed into a residential neighborhood in Remscheid, killing thepilot and five others on the ground and igniting a huge blaze thatdestroyed two dozen homes.   Some West German officials have charged that American authoritiesmishandled the rescue efforts and delayed releasing information.   The suspension of low-level training, ``through the holidayseason (was agreed to) out of respect for the victims and thefamilies of the victims of the Remscheid accident, and for Capt.Michael Foster, USAF, and his family,'' the communique stated.   Foster, 34, of Seal Beach, Calif., was the pilot of the A-10. Theaccident immediately generated fresh demands in West Germany forcurbs on training flights by North Atlantic Treaty Organization airforces.   The flight suspension was announced shortly after DefenseSecretary Frank C. Carlucci met behind closed doors at the Pentagonwith his West German counterpart, Defense Minister Rupert Scholz.   Neither Scholz nor Carlucci were available after the meeting todiscuss the matter. Scholz previously had said that France, Belgiumand the Netherlands had agreed to his government's request.   On any given day in West Germany, the sky is filled with hundredsof jets and helicopters, leading to public opposition that has beenfueled by recent tragedies.   Even before last week's fatal crash, 12 major accidents ofmilitary aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone. Theyincluded 70 who died from an air show crash in Ramstein in August.   Allied military authorities ordered a temporary suspension oflow-level training missions immediately after the Remscheid crash,only to see opposition West German political parties call for anoutright ban on low-level flights and sharp cuts in air excercises.   A Pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be named saidthere was a serious concern about honoring Germany's request``because we don't want to set any big precedent and we don't wantto reduce our pilot proficiency standards.''   In the end, however, U.S. officials concluded they could notignore a request from the West German government ``that was limitedto a reasonable period of time,'' the source added.   The Pentagon, following Scholz's departure, declined to elaboratepublicly on the brief, two-sentence communique.</TEXT></DOC>
