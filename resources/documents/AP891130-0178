The Roman Catholic Church's Legal Aid office meanwhile issued areport concluding that soldiers carried out the Nov. 16 massacre ofsix Jesuit priests and their two domestic employees.   Guerrillas fired their first anti-aircraft missile Wednesday butmissed the target _ an air force A-37 jet fighter-bomber nearZacatecoluca, 25 miles south of San Salvador, a Western militarysource reported.   A rebel statement said the insurgents would not use the missilesif government aircraft stopped bombing, strafing and firing rockets.   Members of the Salvadoran high command have said missiles couldsignficantly alter the balance of power in the fighting.   The civil war has gone on 10 years and killed 71,000 people.   ``I'm not coming back,'' Kate Lewis, a teacher at the AmericanSchool, said as she carried her 8-month-old baby, Cassandra, downMirador Street to where a U.S. Embassy official was waiting for herand her husband, William.   Other Americans flashed V-for-victory signs at InternationalAirport and shouted, ``We'll be back after Christmas!''   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwilersaid ``departure is voluntary for all embassy dependents andpersonnel who are scheduled for leave or can be spared. We do notknow how many private American residents will take advantage ofthis opportunity. We are encouraging American dependents andpersonnel who can be spared to depart.''   The Lewis home, and 30 or 40 others in the exclusive Escalonneighborhood in the city's western sector, were taken by guerrillasbefore dawn Wednesday.   Rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, orFMLN, observed a six-hour truce beginning 6 a.m. (7 a.m. EST) intheir 20-day offensive, to permit evacuation of those who wished toleave.   The neighborhood was quiet Thursday afternoon and remainingresidents ventured out to assess damage and clear rubble. Soldiersmoved cautiously along the streets and drew no fire. The lastguerrilla snipers appeared to have pulled out from their nests insumptuous homes. Most of the rebels appeared to have retreated upnearby San Salvador volcano by dawn.   ``The FMLN is maintaining a constant siege of the capital, whichis the neurological center of the nation. The fuse of a socialtime-bomb has been lit,'' said the clandestine rebel radioVenceremos.   About 20 U.S. citizens were among scores of people who tookadvantage of the truce to leave Escalon. Many waved white flags andcarried small bundles as they walked past a burned-out light tank,the bodies of soldiers and guerrilla barricades of expensive carswith the tires shot out.   Military spokesmen said five soldiers and 12 guerrillas werekilled in Wednesday's fighting. Reporters counted the bodies of atleast 10 soldiers and saw one dead guerrilla, a woman stillclutching her U.S.-made M-16 rifle.   Four bodies unrecognizable as soldiers, guerrillas or civilianswere burned on a sidewalk.   About 150 U.S. citizens left on the first of two charter flightsarranged by the U.S. Embassy. They included embassy employees anddependents, and Americans living in El Salvador for other reasons.   Many had taken refuge in the embassy or the headquarters of theU.S. Agency for International Development headquarters, both wellaway from the fighting.   Many luxury homes and automobiles were shot up, but residents ofEscalon had few complaints about their treatment by the raggedy,unwashed invaders.   ``They were kind and gentle,'' said Sheri McKibben of Cleveland,who was leaving with her husband, Sam.   Mrs. Lewis said one rebel ventured out to bring fruit juice forher baby.   Manuel Vides, a 48-year-old businessman, used his 9mm pistol ina 20-minute gun battle with rebels who tried to enter his home, butsurrendered after they fired a light anti-tank rocket at his house.   ``They spared my life, and I have to thank them for that,'' hesaid.   Guerrillas took over the home of retired U.S. Army Col. GeorgeMynus, former military attache at the U.S. Embassy. His wife,Rosie, said wounded guerrillas were treated there. They and theirthree children left Thursday.   A young Salvadoran man whose house was occupied described theguerrillas as ``very respectful,'' but added: ``The very act ofinvading a civilian neighborhood and turning it into a combat zoneis a great maliciousness on their part.''   In the report on the massacre at the Simeon Canas CentralAmerican University, the Church Legal Aid office said ``all theevidence and indicators establish that those responsible for themurder of the six Jesuit priests and their two domestics weremembers of the armed forces.''   It noted that the attackers wore army uniforms, according to awitness; they spent at least an hour shooting up part of the campusin the middle of a dusk-to-dawn curfew; the zone was militarized,with troops guarding southern access to the nearby headquarters ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff; the assassins used sophisticated arms,including flame-throwers, and burned some priests' offices, andsoldiers searched the residence two days before the massacre.   President Alfredo Cristiani has promised to find and punishthose responsible.   A small plane carrying 25 anti-aircraft missiles crashedSaturday in eastern El Salvador. The government said the plane andits four-man crew, all of whom died, were Nicaraguan, and brokediplomatic relations with Managua.   Missiles are presumed to have been delivered on another planethat landed Saturday in southern El Salvador and was burned by itscrew.   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua has not denied his countrysent the weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
