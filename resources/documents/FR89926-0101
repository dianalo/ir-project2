DPR-44, and DPR-56,issued to Philadelphia Electric Company, Public Service Electric and GasCompany, Delmarva Power and Light Company, Atlantic City Electric Company(the licensees) for operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station,Unit Nos. 2 and 3, located in York County, Pennsylvania. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Identification of Proposed ActionThe proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications (TSs)to reflect the installation of an additional transformer to supply offsitepower to the station. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendments dated March 9, 1989. The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed changes to the TS are required to clarify that the new transformeris a permissible offsite power source. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision tothe TS. The proposed revision would eliminate uncertainty as to whetherthe new transformer, in addition to the transformers previously installed,is a permissible offsite source, would achieve more consistency with theStandard Technical Specifications and would include the transformer inthe Technical Specification BASES. The proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences ofaccidents, no changes are being made in the types of any effluents thatmay be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowableindividual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly,the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significantradiological environmental impact. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changesto the TS involve systems which are not located within the restricted areaas defined in 10 CFR part 20. These changes do not affect nonradiologicalplant effluents and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, theCommission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmentalimpacts associated with the proposed amendments. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment To Facility OperatingLicense and Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determinationand Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 28, 1989 (54 FR 27235). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.Alternatives to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin Technical Specifications which do not completely reflect the permissiblesources of offsite power to the plant. Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement related to the Operation of PeachBottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3, dated April 1973. Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.
