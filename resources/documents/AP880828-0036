West Germany last week announced the arrest of former U.S. ArmySgt. Clyde Lee Conrad, who since the late 1970s allegedly soldclassified information from the Army base in Bad Kreuznach.   Officials said Conrad, 41, revealed secrets about nuclearmissile bases, pipeline systems and troop strength to Hungarianagents, who passed them on to the Kremlin and other Soviet bloccountries.   But the spy ring may have been receiving NATO information longbefore Conrad became active, according to the Welt am Sonntagnewspaper, which quoted information from unidentified U.S.investigators.   Conrad was in charge of safekeeping classified NATO documents,which were held in a safe at the Bad Kreuznach base. The newspapersaid U.S. security officers believe Conrad's predecessor at thebase documentation center also worked for the Hungarian secretservice.   The report said Hungary, a Soviet bloc ally, for years``systematically'' targeted Americans in West Germany. It saidConrad's predecessor was a U.S. military officer of Hungariandescent who sold NATO information to Hungarian agents. It did notgive his name, did not specify how long he worked at the base anddid not say where he is now.   ``There is the fear that for decades top NATO secrets have goneto the Soviet bloc from Americans in West Germany,'' the newspapersaid.   Norm Medland, the duty officer at the public information officeof the U.S. Army European Headquarters in Heidelberg, told TheAssociated Press Sunday that an investigation was continuing. Hewould not elaborate.   Medland also refused comment on the report in the Hamburg-basedWelt am Sonntag, a conservative, nationally circulated Sundaynewspaper.   Investigators said Conrad reported to a Hungarian ``spymaster''living in Vienna and that two Hungarian-born Swedish brothers _Sandor Kercsik, 48, and Imre Kercsik, 34 _ admitted working for theHungarian intelligence service. Prosecutors say the brothers actedas couriers in the spy ring allegedly headed by Conrad. Thebrothers were arraigned last week in Sweden.   Welt am Sonntag said the spymaster has been found but that he issafe from prosecution under Austrian law. It did not elaborate.   The newspaper said investigators believe Conrad was paid $1.1million by Soviet bloc countries for the information.   The Conrad family ``had so much of everything,'' neighborJohanna Horst told the unofficial U.S. military newspaper Stars andStripes. Mrs. Horst said Conrad's wife, Antje, ``had lots of goldjewelry and he just gave her a new car with her initials in gold.''   Stars and Stripes said Saturday that Conrad, who left the Armyin 1985, received a monthly pension of $900.   West German invesigators said they believe Conrad kept the moneyin Swiss bank accounts, according to the CBS television network.Swiss prosecutors Friday launched an investigation.   The former sergeant remains in prison and faces espionagecharges that carry a maximum 10-year sentence.   Among other charges, he allegedly paid another U.S. soldier ``afive-figure sum'' for obtaining secret information, according tochief West German prosecutor Kurt Rebmann.   No charges have been filed against the soldier, who has left theArmy but is still in West Germany, the Die Welt newspaper of Bonnsaid Saturday.   The former soldier apparently provided information leading toConrad's arrest on Tuesday, Die Welt said.   U.S. Army officials said Conrad, of Sebring, Ohio, obtained atop secret security clearance in 1978 and kept it when he left theservice.</TEXT></DOC>
