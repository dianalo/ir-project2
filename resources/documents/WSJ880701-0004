The prospect of further oil-price declines broke investors' drought-related inflation anxieties and propelled stock prices higher. Indeed, airline stocks, which are sensitive to the fuel price outlook, propelled the Dow Jones Transportation Average to its highest level since the stock market crash of last October. Oil stocks, meanwhile, fell sharply.    The price of West Texas Intermediate reached its own milestone, closing at a low for the year of $15.16 a barrel, down 27 cents, in futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.    With OPEC output edging higher, industry analysts described crude-market fundamentals as overwhelmingly bearish. Some went so far as to describe a possible replay of the events that led to the 1986 oil-price crash. OPEC today, as then, &quot;is in a battle for market share,&quot; said Philip K. Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Washington-based Institute for International Economics and an expert on petroleum-price behavior.    But there are notable differences, chiefly involving the position of Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading producer, which was widely credited -- or blamed -- for orchestrating the 1986 price collapse. Saudi Arabia currently is staying within its OPEC production quota as others exceed their allotments, although there is speculation as to how long the kingdom will exercise such restraint.    And while most industry experts expect further deterioration in crude prices in the seasonally weak third quarter, some also are beginning to look for an end to the slide in the weeks ahead, perhaps by midsummer. Dennis K. Winters, senior oil economist for DRI Energy, New York, suggests the bottom for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, could be around $15 a barrel, only slightly lower than the current quote.    Geoffrey S. Pyne, oil-market analyst with the London brokerage firm of Phillips andamp; Drew, is more pessimistic on the direction of prices. But he also expects the crude market to bottom soon, perhaps in July, with West Texas Intermediate at around $14 a barrel and the North Sea Brent crude at about $13.    On European spot markets yesterday, the widely traded Brent fell 35 cents a barrel, with the August-delivery crude at $14.50 late in the day. Egypt, meanwhile, sharply reduced its oil export prices for the first half of July, dropping its chief grade, the Suez Blend, by $1.60 a barrel to $12.75. Other prices were reduced by between $1.45 and $1.85 a barrel.    Oil officials of Egypt, which isn't a member of OPEC, blamed the cartel's quota cheaters for weak world oil prices. They didn't name the OPEC countries responsible for the overproduction, but some oil analysts cited Middle East members.    While the North African country of Libya recently began exceeding its quota of one million barrels a day, much of the focus is on the United Arab Emirates. The UAE supreme petroleum council vowed this week to produce 500,000 barrels a day more than the OPEC-assigned quota of slightly under one million barrels a day.    The UAE has been a frequent violator of OPEC quotas in the past, and its actions might have been ignored in this case if there hadn't been a public announcement of its intention to exceed the allotment. Also, its production, which had declined to less than 1.3 million barrels a day in recent weeks, now has reversed direction and is headed toward the targeted 1.5 million barrels a day.    Iraq also remains outside OPEC's quota system because it hasn't been given an allotment equal to the 2.4 million barrels a day of its war foe, Iran. Iraq's output now exceeds 2.6 million barrels a day and is expanding again after declining for much of June. It is easily capable of producing more than 2.8 million barrels a day.    Total OPEC production averaged around 18.5 million barrels a day for much of the second quarter. That was considered some 500,000 barrels a day more than oil markets required. Output is even higher now, totaling slightly more than 18.6 million barrels a day, according to Petro-Logistics Ltd., a Geneva, Switzerland, consulting firm.    &quot;There doesn't seem to be anybody around to put his finger in the dike,&quot; said Conrad Gerber, president of Petro-Logistics.    Petroleum refiners in the U.S. and Europe are said to be abetting the OPEC production surge, just as they did in 1986. Despite crude's weakness, petroleum-product markets are fairly firm, largely because of strong gasoline demand. Refiners' profit margins are good as a result, and most are processing crude at capacity.    Also, some oil companies are buying the bargain-priced crude to store it even though inventories already are near a five-year high. Most OPEC countries are eager to oblige the buyers even though they are having to cut prices to close the sales. All 13 member nations are using market-related pricing formulas to maintain volumes.    But Mr. Verleger and others note that the OPEC countries haven't moved to the type of &quot;on-arrival netback&quot; schemes that fueled the 1986 price crash while giving refiners a risk-free ride. Under those arrangements, crudes were priced according to values of products processed from them. As product prices slumped, crude purchases were automatically cheaper, feeding the downward spiral.    Even so, &quot;whatever pricing discipline was in the market has broken down,&quot; said John Venners, president of Washington-based Independent Term Supply, which negotiates OPEC-supply contracts for several independent U.S. refiners. </TEXT></DOC>
