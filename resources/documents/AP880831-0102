Soldiers, meanwhile, went from house-to-house searching forstriking engineers who closed Burma's largest oil refinery, sourcessaid. The engineers and other workers have gone on strike to pressfor democracy.   Also today, 1,200 more prisoners were released from Insein Jailin the capital and another prison in the central city of Mandalay,the state-run Radio Rangoon said. Authorities have been freeingprisoners after disturbances last week at these and seven otherjails.   ``The government has permitted peaceful assembly and processionsunder the constitution,'' the radio broadcast also said. ``In sometowns, People's Council (local government) offices and othergovernment buildings are illegally occupied by the people.''   ``Illegal occupants must vacate the People's Council offices andgovernment buildings immediately or face the consequences,'' saidthe statement signed by Maung Ko, secretary to the Council ofMinisters, or the Cabinet.   The broadcast did not specify the possible consequences.   Scarce gasoline supplies and a 5-day-old strike by railroadworkers continued to cripple the nation's transportation system,contributing to food shortages, a Western diplomat said.   The government has remained silent on the strikers' demands, andspreading violence and disorder have given rise to rumors of animpending military coup. Some observers say the Burma SocialistProgram Party is orchestrating the chaos in order to intervene andre-establish itself.   Authorities on Tuesday freed hundreds of inmates from Burmesejails.   Striking employees from more than 120 government departments andstate-owned corporations on Tuesday formed a committee to agitatefor an end to one-party rule. Their All Services General StrikeCommittee was the fourth illegal association created in Burma inthree days.   Students and dock workers also have formed unions and 21 elderstatesmen, some associated with the last elected government 26years ago, created a Committee for Democracy.   In addition, citizens have formed committees in an attempt togovern many Burmese cities, which were left without authoritieswhen troops and officials loyal to the embattled government clearedout.   Burma's turmoil began after the July 23 resignation of ruler NeWin, who ended democracy with a 1962 military coup, establishedone-party rule and outlawed all other parties, unions andassociations.   Thousands of citizens staged protests against Ne Win's hard-linesuccessor, Sein Lwin, and at least 112 people were killed inclashes with security forces.   The violence continued until Sein Lwin resigned and was replacedAug. 19 by civilian lawyer Maung Maung. Since then, peacefulrallies and widespread strikes demanding an end to one-party rulehave continued.   The strikes have paralyzed most government services andindustries, including the country's only oil refineries _ inSyriam, about 10 miles southeast of Rangoon, and in the centralcity of Mann. Severe gasoline shortages has forced transportationto a crawl.   Workers at the Syriam refinery _ which had produced 26,000barrels of oil per day _ staged an occupation strike after studentscalled for a nationwide general strike two weeks ago.   The plant was shut down and military engineers tried in vain tooperate it. On Tuesday, authorities ordered soldiers to beginhouse-to-house searches for civilian engineers from the refinery toforce them back to work, an engineer told The Associated Presstoday. So far, the soldiers haven't found the striking employees,said the engineer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said heand his colleagues have gone into hiding and would strike untilauthorities form an interim government to lead the country todemocracy.</TEXT></DOC>
