LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli troops Wednesday shot and killed aPalestinian radical who kidnapped an American relief worker lastweek, the army said.   Earlier, a bomb wounded three Israelis and an Arab in a crowded,open-air market in the Israeli town of Ramle, and vengeful Israelisstabbed two Arabs, police said. Paramilitary police rushed to thetown near Tel Aviv to prevent further violence against Arabs.   The dead Palestinian radical, Mohammed Abu Nasr, was identifiedas leader of a three-man gang that abducted Chris George ofMontclair, N.J., on June 22.   Israel television and Arab reports said Nasr was in a taxi he hadhijacked when soldiers shot him. He was carrying a pistol and twoclips of bullets, said an army statement that gave no details of theshooting.   George was freed unharmed after a day when he agreed to carry aletter from Nasr pleading with President Bush to recognizePalestinian rights.   The army said Nasr is suspected of two other Gaza Strip attacksthis month. In one, an Israeli military government employee was shotand wounded, and in the other, an Israeli gasoline truck driver washit in the head with an ax.   Israeli news reports said George was abducted by the PalestineLiberation Organization, but Yasser Arafat's organization maintainsNasr acted on his own and was mentally deranged.   Nasr, who was in his late 30s, had been jailed for being a memberof Arafat's Fatah faction and was released in a 1985 prisoner swap.   George, 35, declined comment on his kidnapper's death.   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Israelitroops wounded at least 13 Palestinians in clashes withstone-throwers, and a man died of injuries suffered in a beating byyouths who accused him of collaborating with Israel.   His death brings the toll to 538 Palestinians killed since Arabsstarted revolting against Israeli occupation in December 1987.Sixty-nine have been killed by Arabs as suspected collaborators.Twenty-three Israelis also have been killed.   Israel's Supreme Court denied a Palestinian's appeal againstdeportation, authorizing the expulsion of the 48th resident of theoccupied territories since the revolt began. It ruled Bilal IzzidinHussein Shakhsheer, 37, carried out anti-Israeli activities for anoutlawed extremist PLO faction.   A survey of 104 leaders in the West Bank and Gaza showed 83percent favor an Israeli plan to hold elections for Palestinianrepresentatives to negotiate with Israel, but only under certainconditions, a Palestinian magazine reported.   Bayader Assiyassi said it asked if leaders favored elections oncondition Israeli troops withdraw from occupied cities beforeinternationally supervised elections.   Eighty-six percent of those favoring elections insisted troops bewithdrawn from all the occupied lands, the survey showed.   PLO and some Palestinian leaders in the occupied lands rejectPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan, saying it does not guaranteean independent Palestinian state.   In apparent response to right-wing opponents of his plan, Shamirsaid Wednesday that crushing the 18-month uprising is Israel's``first security objective.''   But he added, ``It should be clear ... that Israel hasconsciously and deliberately refrained from taking the ruthlessmeasures that could have ended in violence.''   He was addressing an international conference of Jewish leaders,where American Seymour Reich criticized proposals to move anexpected wave of Soviet immigrants to Jewish settlements in theoccupied lands.   ``Soviet Jews should be absorbed through the normal process ofresettlement,'' said Reich, head of the Conference of Presidents ofMajor Jewish Organizations.   He noted the U.S. administration likely would object. Americaopposes the settlements as an obstacle to a U.S.-backed proposal oftrading land for peace.</TEXT></DOC>
