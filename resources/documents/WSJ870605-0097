Seven funds from Fidelity Investments carry the conservative label. Three are stock-and-bond hybrids, one is a convertible bond fund, and three invest in stocks for both income and growth. Their results range from a gain of around 21% to a loss of one percentage point in the first five months.    In theory, the bond holdings are supposed to provide some sort of buffer against volatile stock markets. However, &quot;this year, bonds have been pretty bad,&quot; says C. Bruce Johnstone, a managing director of Fidelity Investments and head of its growth and income funds. Falling bond prices have dragged down returns at many hybrid stock-and-bond funds this year.    That is largely why the Equity Income Fund, which is managed by Mr. Johnstone and emphasizes its stock side, is outpacing the similarly sized Puritan Fund. Puritan, classified as a balanced fund, usually maintains 30% to 40% of its holdings in bonds while Equity Income must be 80% in stocks (which can include convertible securities). Equity Income, with $4.05 billion in assets, is up around 13% so far this year while Puritan, with $4.4 billion in assets, is up around 8.9%.    The make-up &quot;of my fund is very different,&quot; says Mr. Johnstone, noting he has only about 10% of the Equity Income Fund invested in straight bonds and preferred stocks, with the bulk of the bond portion in high-yield, so-called junk bonds. About 68% of the fund is in common stocks, which have been performing better than bonds lately. About 17% is in convertible securities, and the rest is in cash.    Meanwhile, Puritan has 35% in bonds -- including about 20% in junk bonds -- and 55% in stocks, he says.    The two funds own many of the same securities, including shares in General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., and American Electric Power Co., as well as debt of Coastal Corp., SCI Holdings Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.    &quot;That's a source of confusion,&quot; says Eric Kobren, who edits a newsletter devoted to Fidelity's funds. While discrepancies among funds within a given category exist throughout the industry, they are noticeable at Fidelity simply because it has so many funds in a variety of categories.    While Mr. Kobren and others note that investors should take care in matching their investment objectives with what is actually going on in a fund, that is a task easier said than done since published holdings are usually out of date.    Still, finding out any details of the portfolio can be useful. For instance, Mr. Kobren says, &quot;I recently turned sour on Puritan&quot; because of its junk bond holdings.    Meanwhile, Qualified Dividend's performance is strikingly different from that of the other funds and from its own showing last year.    The fund, which is only for institutional investors, is down about 1% this year compared to a gain of nearly 21% last year. The fund is heavily weighted in electric utilities, which have been notoriously weak this year.    Part of the reason Mr. Johnstone's Equity Income fund is holding up so well is because he cut back on his electric utility holdings late last year and plowed the proceeds into more cyclical common stocks such as chemicals, metals and gas producers. That proved fortunate, he says, noting those cyclicals had a &quot;tremendous run&quot; in the first quarter.    Mr. Johnstone has since cut back the cyclicals and increased utility holdings, which he thinks should start to do better.    Until April, Puritan was co-managed by Francis Cabour, who directed the equity portion and Patricia Ostrander, who ran the bond side. Mr. Cabour, who turns 65 this year, is lessening his work load, although he continues to manage the Balanced Fund. Ms. Ostrander, who held her post since 1980, left the firm to strike out on her own.    The fund is now being managed by Richard Fentin, formerly manager of the Growth Company Fund in the Fidelity family. Mr. Fentin is assisted on the bond side by Margaret Eagle, who was previously an assistant portfolio manager for the High Income Fund. Both Mr. Fentin and Ms. Eagle declined to be interviewed.    Fidelity, which is sometimes sensitive about its proportion of youthful portfolio managers, says Mr. Fentin is 31. Ms. Eagle declined to give her age, although associates put her in her 30s.    ---   Money Fund Assets Fail   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 383 money market funds fell $423.1 million to $238.91 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade association, said.
