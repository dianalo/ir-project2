(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The probe of the collision of two ArmyBlackhawk helicopters that killed 17 soldiers has found no link tomechanical problems that have grounded the military's UH-60s inrecent years, an investigator says.   ``I would say now there is no indication of any mechanicalfactor'' in Tuesday night's crash, said Chief Warrant Officer JoeS. Adams, one of three investigators from the Army Safety Center atFort Rucker, Ala.   ``We are looking at human and environmental factors. The humanfactors might include some restriction of vision,'' he saidWednesday.   Both pilots were using night-vision goggles, which amplify lightfrom the stars and the moon, allowing pilots to fly undetected atnight. Officials said they were trying to determine whether thechoppers were flying without lights.   The crash was the worst Army aviation disaster since 248soldiers, also based at Fort Campbell, died in a chartered planecrash in Canada while returning from a Mideast peacekeeping missionin December 1985.   The 17 died instantly in the collision, the worst ever at thefort in southwestern Kentucky, but eight bodies remained buriedunder the wreckage for hours, spokesmen said.   The Army's fleet of 820 UH-60s was grounded twice last May, oncefor inspection and once because of a design flaw. The fleet alsowas grounded in April 1985 and March 1986 after fatal crashes. In1985, the Army identified a defect in the main rotor assembly andordered it corrected.   Last summer, officials said about 40 people had been killed incrashes of the helicopter since 1978.   The collision occurred when a copter on a night training missionstruck a formation of three other Blackhawks on a separate mission,Adams said.   The formation was flying east at about 250 feet above the groundwhen the lead Blackhawk was hit broadside by the lone aircraft,which was traveling north, Army spokesmen said.   A flight data recorder, installed in 100 of the Army'shelicopters, was recovered from the northbound craft and will bechecked for signs of mechanical failure in the copter, Adams said.The other craft had no recorder.   The manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft of Stratford, Conn., sent asafety expert to assist investigators. Adams said a report wasexpected in two to three months.   Investigators hoped that air traffic control tapes would revealwhether the pilots knew their copters were converging.   The helicopters are not equipped with radar and the pilots,wearing the night vision goggles, were operating under visualflight rules, with visibility of at least one mile and a ceiling of500 feet, Adams said.   The accident occurred on the Kentucky-Tennessee state line 6miles from the copters' airstrip, about 60 miles north of Nashville.   The Army identified the dead as: Staff Sgt. Charles L. Shirley,32, of Madison, Ill.; Billie D. Bolin, 29, of Greensburg, Ky.;James M. Guill, 33, of Georgetown, Ky.; Richard L. Alter, 29, ofWilliamsport, Pa. and Clifford W. Bath III, 19, of Charleston, S.C.   Also, Michael A. Jankowski, 19, of Sussex, Wis.; James Draper,Jr., 20, of Fruitland, N.M.; Jeffrey L. Rivas, 26, of SantaBarbara, Calif.; Andrew J. Franklin III, 20, of Advance, Ind. andMichael Daniel, 32, of Delaware, Ohio.   Also, Brian J. LeBlanc, 21, of Cold Springs, Minn.; Sgt. DennisC. Sabot, 30, of Bismark, N.D.; Gregory T. Dean, 24, of Liberty,Ky.; Spec. 4 Samuel A. Hintz, 24, of Sherrodsville, Ohio andTimothy S. Sayer, 20, of Worthington, Ohio.   Shirley, Sabot and Hintz were from the 2nd Battalion, 502ndInfantry. Identifications of the other two victims were withheldpending notification of relatives.   ``He believed he was doing what was right, doing it for hiscountry,'' Jerry Shirley of Clarksville, Tenn., said of hisbrother, an 11-year Army man. ``It's something he wanted to do. Hewas a career man. He started when he was 17 and had a break andwent back in. We accepted the risk.''   Lt. Col. Charles Adams, the post chaplain, said 35 chaplains onpost, social service agencies and a support group of military wiveshave offered help to survivors. A memorial service was scheduledfor next Wednesday.   ``There's a tremendous amount of shock and grief (but) there hasbeen no recrimination from any of the people we have talked to,''said Adams.   Thirteen of the dead, most of them infantrymen, were in theBlackhawk that had been flying in formation. The other victims werecrew members in the second copter.   The Blackhawk, one of the Army's newer helicopters, normally isoperated with a crew of three and can carry 11 combat-equippedsoldiers.   It is a utility and assault aircraft designed for air cavalryand medical evacuations, said Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman inWashington, D.C.   Soucy said there had been no move by safety investigators toground the Blackhawk fleet as a result of the accident.</TEXT></DOC>
