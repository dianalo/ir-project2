But in denying a request from Pillsbury shareholders that thefood company's board be forced to drop the pill, Hennepin CountyDistrict Judge Thomas Carey urged negotiations between Pillsbury andits suitor.   ``The Pillsbury board must be left to do its own work, but itseems to this court that direct negotiations may be justified,'' hesaid.   Carey said there were no legal issues that would preventPillsbury, the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant company, fromnegotiating the $60-a-share offer from Grand Met.   The British firm also has asked that the pill _ which allowsshareholders to buy Pillsbury stock at a steep discount and raisesthe cost of a hostile takeover _ be removed so shareholders canconsider its offer.   But on Monday, retired Justice William Duffy of the DelawareChancery Court denied Grand Met's motion to suppress the pill. Heruled that, as of Oct. 17, Pillsbury's directors had not abdicatedtheir responsibility to shareholders in rejecting Grand Met's offer.   Pillsbury announced Monday it was spinning off its Burger Kingrestaurant division to stockholders, and Grand Met responded byrenewing its motion before the Delaware court.   On Wednesday, Duffy denied Grand Met's request for a rehearing,but said he could still consider scheduling another hearing on theissue if Grand Met files new evidence.   The poison pill would allow Pillsbury to issue new stock thatGrand Met would have to acquire to take control of the company. Thecost of a takeover would rise to about $20 billion.   Analysts differed on whether the poison pill could stymie GrandMet's takeover offer.   ``The poison pill is a significant deterrent to closing thetransaction,'' said Allen Finkelson of Cravath, Swaine andamp; Moore,Grand Met's New York law firm.   But Craig Carver of the investment firm Dain Bosworth Inc., saidPillsbury's poison pill defense was a small bargaining chip.   ``I would not anticipate that would hold much water, given thefact that 75 percent of the shares have been tendered anyway,'' hesaid. ``Frankly, I would anticipate the two companies to sit downand negotiate at the table.''   On Wednesday, Grand Met said nearly 63.4 million shares, or 74.3percent of Pillsbury's outstanding stock, had been tendered underits offer.   The British firm also increased the pressure on Pillsbury byextending its offer, which had been scheduled to expire Tuesdaynight, until midnight Nov. 14.   Analysts had speculated Grand Met would extend the offer todemonstrate to Pillsbury a strong showing among shareholders whohave agreed to sell their shares.   Grand Met had to say how many shares were tendered, or offeredfor sale, if it was to extend the buyout offer. With the offerextended, however, shareholders could take back their shares untilthe next Grand Met deadline.   Carver said, ``I think (Grand Met) is continuing to applypressure to Pillsbury's board. Grand Met is obviously dealing fromstrength here.''   ``I think the ball is back in Pillsbury's court,'' he said.   Carver said he expected the two companies will ``sit down andnegotiate at the table.''</TEXT></DOC>
