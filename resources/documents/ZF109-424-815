weak errorhandling; poor manual.andM;DesignStudio annex still has potentialandM;By Sam HuntingandM;The DesignScript manual starts with two thesis statements: &quot;DesignScript is apowerful tool, automating many aspects of desktop publishing,&quot; and&quot;DesignScript is a command language that you can use to automaticallygenerate DesignStudio documents indistinguishable from those you createmanually.&quot;andM;While the first statement is true of Letraset's annex for its DesignStudiopage-layout package, the second is questionable.andP;  DesignStudio withDesignScript installed has far and away the most powerful style tags of the&quot;big three&quot; Mac DTP packages, but users still will have to perform manyessential tasks manually.andM;Command economies.andP;  When you place DesignScript in DesignStudio's Annexfolder, a new Open Script command appears under the Annex menu inDesignStudio.andP;  DesignScript produces documents by interpreting speciallycoded files opened with this feature.andM;A DesignScript script is simply a plain file with embedded coding.andP;  The filehas two parts: the typeset document itself and a prologue statement, in whichparameters that control the entire document are set.andM;The document is typeset with mnemonic commands in a format familiar to usersof Compugraphic Corp.'s MCS PowerView machines.andP;  andless;PSnnnandgt; sets point size,andless;LSnnnandgt; sets line spacing, andless;HYOandgt; and andless;HYXandgt; turn hyphenation on and off, andso on.andM;But prologue statements yield capabilities of which the PowerView operatorcould only dream: graphic preferences commands, such as Pencolor andFillcolor.andP;  Font and Style definitions are also made in the prologuestatement.andM;Textblock is DesignScript's single most powerful prologue command.andP;  Whateverthe user can do to a DesignStudio text block with a tool, menu command ordialog box (position, resize, rotate, get text or linkto other text blocks)can be accomplished by setting Textblock parameters.andP;  Since the Pictureblockcommand provides equivalent control of graphic objects, it would seem thatall the elements are in place for automatic page makeup.andP;  Well, not quite.andO;Much manual tweaking of elements still will be required.andM;DesignScript has no control structures.andP;  The user of the TeX typesettinglanguage, for instance, can use an If/Then control structure to beginchapters on odd-numbered pages only.andP;  The DesignScript user must insert thepages manually.andM;DesignScript also has no way of determining the depth of type that has beenset.andP;  It cannot, for example, as can TeX, determine that there is only oneline of text beneath a subhead, so that a page break may be inserted beforeit.andP;  Of course, with no control structures, DesignScript can't insert a pagebreak before setting that subhead anyway.andP;  That must be done manually.andM;Depth, in fact, is a foreign notion to DesignScript.andP;  It cannot, as can TeX,skip &quot;sideways&quot; to place a marginal note beside a paragraph and then resumesetting the paragraph where it left off.andP;  Of course, since the first twoparameters of Textblock (across and down) must be integers, not variables,there is no way to put the location of the wished-for marginal note intoDesignScript, even if the location were known.andP;  More manual labor!andM;To summarize: DesignScript cannot &quot;generate documents indistinguishable fromthose you create manually,&quot; because it lacks the power to handle paginationintelligently.andP;  Page breaks, marginal notations, called quotes, folios,running heads, figures and footnotes will have to be checked over andadjusted by hand.andM;Markup value.andP;  For all its limitations, DesignScript is a powerful tool.andP;  Wetested its limits by filtering a Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML)-encoded representation of a short manual through a prototype HyperCardtranslator, converting it automatically to a script we hoped DesignScriptcould interpret.andP;  (SGML tagging rigorously describes the structure of adocument, not its format.andP;  SGML therefore is uniquely suited to producingdocuments in print, on-line and on disk.) This is a test both Aldus PageMakerand QuarkXPress fail because of their paragraph-based style tags.andO;DesignStudio's style tags, uniquely, are character-based and thusfine-grained enough for successful processing of SGML-encoded documents.andP;  TheDesignScript/DesignStudio combination worked flawlessly here.andM;Productivity.andP;  Productivity in code-based desktop publishing depends on goodmanuals and helpful error checking.andP;  A good manual helps the user learn thelanguage as thoroughly and rapidly as possible.andP;  Error checking can minimizethe number of times a document's code must be tested and revised.andO;DesignScript disappointed us on these counts.andM;Although DesignScript itself is a simple language, the User's Guide makes itneedlessly difficult to learn.andP;  The editors did not see fit to include atable of all DesignScript's commands and parameters.andP;  The resultant pageflipping would be less frustrating if the index weren't so poor.andP;  The indexincludes none of the 50 or so typographic arguments and symbolic commandsthat actually format text.andP;  The items that are included fare badly: Of thefirst 12 entries, three refer the reader to the wrong page.andM;DesignScript's error checking does nothing to shorten the cycle of testingand revising scripts.andP;  When DesignScript encounters an error, it puts up analert box containing the offending text.andP;  It's up to the user to remember orwrite down the error and its context before clicking the OK button, sinceDesignScript does not write errors to a log file.andP;  It's also up to the userto figure out where in a possibly lengthy file the error occurred, sinceDesignScript doesn't supply the line number where it became confused.andP;  If theuser could open the script directly at the error point, edit the script,close it and try it again, DesignScript would be more productive.andP;  Comparedwith DesignScript, TeX's hoary, mainframelike, command-line interface is aparagon of user friendliness.andM;Productivity also depends on having a decent text editor in which to writeyour scripts.andP;  The manual suggests using DesignStudio itself.andP;  Don't.andO;DesignScript depends heavily on bracketed parameters, and DesignStudio cannotcheck those brackets to see if they are properly nested.andP;  A good text editorwill be able to do this.andM;Conclusions.andP;  DesignScript has been at once undermarketed and oversold.andO;DesignScript has been credited with possessing powers for which it has onlypotential; in no way does DesignScript make it possible to generate documentsautomatically.andP;  Meanwhile, DesignScript's unique capability to interpretcontext-sensitive, SGML-type tagging (the golden road to multimediapublication for the desktop publisher) is not merely downplayed, it'signored.andM;If you want the power and flexibility of code, if you can put up with themanual, and if you've got a quick machine so the lengthy testing and revisioncycle doesn't penalize you too much, then DesignScript is a good buy at $125.andM;Letraset is located at 40 Eisenhower Drive, Paramus, N.J.andP;  07653; (201)845-6100.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
