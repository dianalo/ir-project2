With 85% of the voters behind one of the two parties, the coalition can boast one of the largest mandates in Western Europe. The Common Market's plans to create an internal market by 1992 presents economic challenges for this non-European Community nation, where growth continues to be slowed by nationalized industry. The controversial presidency of Kurt Waldheim also shadows the nation's presence abroad. Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, a Socialist, spoke last week with Amity Shlaes, editorial-features editor of the Journal's European edition, about his government's progress and projects:   On Austria's plans to get closer to the Common Market:   Austria plans to decide whether to apply to become a member of the Common Market in 1989. Certain questions have to be answered before we enter discussions for an application: If Austria entered the Common Market tomorrow, our agriculture would be a problem, because the level of subsidy for farmers is higher in Austria than in the Common Market. Entrance in the Common Market is a large project: We must avoid just picking the raisins from the Common Market cake.    Austria's neutral status is not an obstacle here. There is no doubt the nation will stick to neutrality 100%. But our neutrality is a military neutrality, and the Common Market is not a military alliance. {General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership makes things easier because} Gorbachev's general approach to Europe's future is quite different from Brezhnev's.    On World Jewish Congress objections to Common Market links with a nation whose president is Kurt Waldheim:   That is of no relevance at all.    On Austria's high labor costs and plans to shorten the laborers' workweek to 35 hours without cutting salaries:   There is more consensus in Austria for the shorter workweek than there is in, say, West Germany. But the shortening of the workweek isn't necessarily a mere political concession that will increase labor costs. Cutting the workweek can increase productivity. And the shorter week can be compensated for through adjustments in the wage rounds {which are negotiated separately}.    On part-privatization of Austrian Airlines and other plans to privatize:   Privatization isn't the main instrument for remodeling industry. Tapping private capital markets for raising funds for those companies is definitely a method which should be adopted. I'd like to get away from the idea that private ownership is good and public-government-ownership is bad. For example, Voest-Alpine, our nationalized steel company, is in the same kind of crisis as Krupp {a West German steel company that is not dominated by government}. There are some companies where we would go as far as to bring the proportion of public ownership under 50%, like some in the manufacturing area. We would rather not do that with companies like our utility companies.    On the controversy involving Austria's shop hours, now held to be among the shortest in Western Europe by shop owners and unions:   Certainly lengthening store hours would help foreign exchange. But most of the shop owners aren't interested in this, and the employees too have a mixed position. We may try the idea of a &quot;long Saturday,&quot; or lengthening evening hours one or two days during the week. I would welcome a solution here because it would be a good signal for tourism, and it would be in the interests of a general liberalization. But this is only a problem in the big cities, not in some small towns {which have longer hours}.    On the new wave of refugees -- estimated this year between 20,000 and 30,000 -- coming from East Bloc countries:   We look at this primarily from our position as an asylum country. We do not intend to change our {positive} political attitude toward these arrivals. If Europe should be a region where merchandise moves freely, why shouldn't people flow freely?    On Austria's own &quot;Irangate&quot; -- evidence that a subsidiary of the state-owned firm Voest sold cannons to Libya with the knowledge they were destined for Iran during the previous Socialist administration:   Austrian law is clear on this {it is illegal}, and people will be found guilty and they will be punished. But there is no evidence {for the allegation that Socialist Party leader and former Chancellor Fred} Sinowatz knew of the deals. And even if he did, the resignation of my own government would only be taken into consideration if people from my own government were involved. I should add Mr. Sinowatz's {recent} resignation from the leadership of the party was not for this reason.    On the chancellor's own recent trip to Saudi Arabia and whether he plans to continue in the tradition of Bruno Kreisky, a Socialist chancellor who sought a significant role in mediation of Middle East affairs:   My visit opened perspectives for a new phase of cooperation, economically and perhaps even politically. I am examining Austria's readiness to serve third countries on a political level. In this sense, I would be in {the Kreisky} tradition.    On whether as a tax-cutter, and someone who's working to reduce budget deficits and privatize, Chancellor Vranitzky can still call himself a socialist:   Reducing personal income tax, as we have done with our tax reform, is not anti-socialist. Cutting budget deficits gives more elbow room for future activities {to a Socialist-led government}. And privatization as such is not a goal for us.    On the future of Austria's Socialist Party, of which Chancellor Vranitzky will become leader next month, and of socialist parties in Europe in general:   My understanding of socialism, of being a social democrat, is that you have to provide the best possible mix of services that can be rendered by the state. The working class was in a much less comfortable position between the wars and after World War II than it is now, and socialism has changed to correspond to that. {West Germany's Hans-Jochen} Vogel and {Oskar} Lafontaine, {Spain's Felipe} Gonzalez, {Norway's Gro Harlem} Brundtland, {Sweden's Ingvar} Carlsson, {Britain's} Neil Kinnock -- we all understand socialism as a political movement that has to prepare our societies for the future.    On the Waldheim presidency and reports Mr. Vranitzky might resign over trouble it has caused:   Things have become very calm lately about Mr. Waldheim. {In terms of what the world should think of Mr. Waldheim}, I think everybody has to make up his mind by himself. Most people in Austria expect their government to work and not to play the piano of tactics. Therefore I do not think of calling an election before the scheduled one in 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
