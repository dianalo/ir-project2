Of GM's 309,000 retirees, about 84,000 were salaried workers.Hourly workers' pensions and other retirement benefits arenegotiated by the United Auto Workers union, which does notrepresent salaried workers.   In July, GM will change its health care plan for salariedworkers _ both active and retired _ to encourage the use healthmaintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations overGM's traditional Blue Cross-Blue Shield health insurance by forcingusers of the traditional plan to pay deductibles and half of eachmonthly premium.   Single salaried workers will be required to pay $200deductibles, families will pay $250, and both pay 20 percent of thenext $2,500 in medical charges.   Workers who opt for HMOs and PPOs pay no deductibles or premiumsand only 30 percent of charges for each office visit, said John D.Butler, GM's general director of employee benefits.   GM also moved vision and hearing care from separate plans thatcovered all costs into its optional comprehensive coverage, whichhas deductibles and premium cost-sharing, Butler said.   Butler said Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. made similarchanges in 1984. Only 13 percent of GM salaried workers nowparticipate in managed health care plans. None of the changesaffects hourly workers.   GM Chairman Roger Smith said the company made the changes tostem costs and halt abuses. GM spent $2.9 billion on employee andretiree health care in 1987 and faces higher costs in the future asits work force ages and the number of active workers supportingeach retiree shrinks.   Separately, GM increased salaried pensions by $850 a year.Butler said the increases will total $3,400 by 1990, while thechanges in the health care plan could cost salaried workers andretirees $750 a year.   ``We are No. 1 in benefits literally in the world by almost anymeasure,'' Smith said. He said the retirees' anger ``would be aneasy thing to fix ... next time it comes around, we don't put themoney in cash, we put it back in the benefits. But that means thepeople who don't use the benefits are going to get hurt and thepeople who do use them, or abuse them, are going to be better off.That's what we tried to avoid.''   A typical GM salaried employee who retired at age 65 in 1985receives about $40,400 a year in pension benefits and SocialSecurity payments, Butler said. Smith said GM retirees earn morethan 66 percent of active workers in the United States.   At a news conference after the nearly five-hour meeting, Smithalso told reporters GM spent $3 billion on buyer incentives in1987, which helped improve GM's share of the U.S. vehicle market to37.4 percent in first-quarter 1988 from 33.4 percent in the fourthquarter of 1987.   Smith said he believes any savings from eliminating incentiveswould be overcome by resulting lost sales.   Smith also said GM hasn't decided whether it will needadditional plant closings to shrink the company's productioncapacity to fit its market share, which is still well below the 45percent GM held several years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
