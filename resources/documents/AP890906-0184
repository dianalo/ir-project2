With 92 percent of the vote counted, Dutch Television projectedthat Lubbers' middle-of-the-road Christian Democratic Appeal wouldkeep its 54 seats in the 150-seat Dutch Parliament and remain thelargest single group in the legislature.   The largest parliamentary party traditionally gets thepremiership in the Dutch system. The results showed voters ralliedbehind Ludders, the longest-serving Dutch leader in 30 years.   The television projection said the right-wing Liberals, juniorpartners in the center-right coalition government, would lose fiveof their 27 seats, and indicated a loss of three of its 52 seats forthe Labor Party.   The Liberal loss, combined with longstanding tensions within thecoalition, could open the way to a center-left alliance, with Laborgetting its first share of power after seven years in opposition.   Lubbers' center-right coalition government crumbled in May overenvironmental policy in a clash that also reflected years ofirritation among the Liberals at having to accept ChristianDemocratic programs.   The Christian Democrats form the fulcrum of power in Dutchpolitics and traditionally join forces with either Labor or theLiberals.   Lubbers said the Liberals' loss was ``tough, very tough'' for hisformer coalition partners but did not rule out entering a newalliance with them.   However, Lubbers also said in the television interview that``there's no reason'' why he might not build a coalition with Labor.   Most electoral gains went to the opposition Democrats '66 Party,which steers close to Labor, and Green Left, an upstart alliance ofenvironmentalists and anti-NATO activists that includes theCommunist Party of the Netherlands. Both parties picked up threeseats, giving 12 seats to the Democrats '66 and six for the GreenLeft.   Queen Beatrix now will appoint an official to supervise thebuilding of a new coalition and getting it to agree on a governmentplatform and the division of ministerial posts.   The Chrstian Democrats' parliamentary floor leader, Bert deVries, said in a television interview it would be a ``prettycomplicated business'' for his party to agree on a new center-rightalliance with the Liberals.   The highly popular Lubbers came to power in 1982 on a platform ofeconomic recovery focused on bringing down the nation's budgetdeficit, then at 10 percent of net national income, and its 17percent unemployment rate.   The budget deficit is expected to be down to 5.25 percent nextyear, with 610,000 people, or 11.3 percent of the workingpopulation, still unemployed.   But as economic prospects looked up, Lubbers turned to theenvironment and fielded an ambitious, $3.3 billion plan to clean upthe heavily polluted Dutch soil, air and waterways.   The plan sparked his government's fall when the Liberals rejectedLubbers' proposal to partly finance it by ending income tax breaksfor the nation's car-driving commuters.   If the Christian Democrats and Labor form a new Cabinet, thatcould herald a substantial easing of the austere economic programsthat earned Lubbers his media nickname ``Rude Shock.''   Labor has been accusing Lubbers of unfairly burdening low-incomegroups like the 3 million people living on subsistence-level socialbenefits as well as the sick and elderly.</TEXT></DOC>
