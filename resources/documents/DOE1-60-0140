The improvement in minicomputer technologyand related software along with the recent deregulation of the telephoneindustry are a few of the outside factors that contributed to the developmentof cost-effective and efficient data-retrieval systems. The Equitablehas spent a great deal of time and effort in the evaluation, testing,and further development of a data-retrieval system. Several of the availablesystems offer technology well beyond the realm of remote meter reading.In this paper the authors established evaluation criteria and identifiedmany of the advantages as well as the disadvantages associated with thevarious technologies. In addition, they stressed the importance of implementinga data-retrieval system that can accommodate the data required to operatea gas utility during this period of intense competition and customerawareness.</TEXT></DOC>
