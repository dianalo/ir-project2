Government control isback in style.   Inflation is 20 percent, even by conservative official estimates.Money supply is up an astonishing 40 percent. Local governments,ignoring austerity orders from Beijing, are throwing money at newprojects and contributing to an unsustainable industrial growth rateof 20 percent.   Corruption is rife, particularly among local officials takingadvantage of a two-tiered pricing system to obtain hard-to-getmaterials at low state-set prices and resell them for huge gains onthe free or black markets.   The last straw came in August, when rumors of new price increasescaused panic buying and runs on banks in several major cities.   The economy is growing so fast, with a 45 percent jump ininvestment in capital construction, that many factories are closedthree days a week because of electricity shortages. The CommunistParty Central Committee, in a plenary session in late September, putnew reform initiatives on hold. The party said the next two yearswould be devoted to ``restoring control of the economic environmentand rectifying economic order.''   Officials are assuring foreign investors and businesses, however,that the original terms of their contracts will still be honored.   The new policies were seen as a sign that Premier Li Peng, whohas a reputation as being cautious, has gained a larger say indecisions. The headlong reform drive advocated by party leader ZhaoZiyang appears discredited, although early reports that he was inpolitical trouble have not been substantiated.   Over the past decade, the government has given provinces, citiesand special economic zones more authority to spend their ownrevenues, borrow money abroad, conduct trade and approve developmentprojects.   ``The Chinese are reacting to this (economic crisis) in the waythey know best,'' said one Western economist in Beijing, ``bystraight intervention.''   Among the more important measures:   _Prices. Plans to decontrol prices of steel and other basicmaterials have been shelved and government price controls have beenre-established over a wide range of consumer goods. Price ceilingswill be set for grain sold on the free market and prices of otheritems prized by speculators, such as fertilizers and pesticides,will be regulated. Price inspectors will fan out around the countryto monitor market activities. Premier Li said the two-tiered pricingsystem will remain ``for quite a long time.''   _Banking-Investment. Bank loans to industrial and constructionprojects outside the state plan and to non-profitable companies arebeing frozen. Loans to foreign joint ventures will not be affected,officials say.   The government will investigate and may close many of theestimated 500 little-regulated finance companies that have sprung upin recent years and are a primary source of reckless lending.Hundreds of state-run trade and investment firms also face closurefor illegal profiteering rackets.   In one celebrated case, the government removed trading and taxprivileges from the Kang Hua Development Corp., a rapidly expandinginvestment firm with links to Deng Pufang, the son of senior leaderDeng Xiaoping.   _Construction. Construction of office buildings, auditoriums andhotels is to be halted except for projects already approved byplanning authorities in Beijing, and a two- to three-year ban onstarting such buildings has been imposed.   _Public Spending. The State Council, China's cabinet, increasedfrom 19 to 29 the number of items that public offices can purchaseonly after receiving approval from above. The list includes cars,air conditioners and video recorders.   Public offices buying imported cars and televisions will beslapped with a 40 percent surcharge, and 20 percent tax was put onbanquets using public funds. Government employees are forbidden tostay in high-class hotels or to offer cigarettes and wine to guests.   _Corruption. The government set up 27 special teams to mount anationwide four-month campaign on cheating, tax evasion,profiteering and illegal payment of bonuses.   The government has acted twice before in the past decade, mostrecently in 1985, to cool off an overheated economy. In both casesresults were mixed and local officials soon reverted to ignoringfaraway Beijing.   Despite government orders to reduce all public spending by 20percent this year, such spending is up by 20 percent.   Premier Li, in a speech Sept. 30, emphasized that this time``orders must be obeyed and prohibitions observed. It is absolutelyimpermissible for each to go his own way.''   However, Chinese officials stress, and foreign economistsgenerally agree, that the revival of controls is temporary, andChina will proceed with its market-oriented reforms once the currenteconomic crisis is overcome.   The Western economist, speaking on condition of anonymity, notedthat the government continues to push such reform ideas as sellingstocks in state-run companies and freeing enterprises frombureaucratic interference.   ``There's no indication that somehow they think central planningis the way,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs Nov. 2</NOTE></DOC>
