Stewart and Daniel Hertzberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> JUS SEC </G><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission approved -- but agreed not to file immediately -- a complaint charging Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Michael Milken, Drexel's head of junk-bond trading, with a broad array of securities-law violations.    Drexel asserted its innocence, but in a memo to employees suggested for the first time that it might seek to settle the SEC charges.    The commission's vote follows weeks of sometimes heated negotiations between the SEC staff, which has been ready to proceed against Drexel for months, and the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which is still conducting a related criminal investigation of Drexel, according to people familiar with the cases. A compromise was reached in which the SEC approved the complaint, but agreed not to file it until the criminal investigation is over, the people said.    The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office has given no indication as to when it might act, and a spokesman for the office declined comment.    The SEC action, first reported in yesterday's Washington Post, was confirmed by a Drexel spokesman. Drexel blamed the investigation on Ivan F. Boesky, the former takeover speculator currently serving a three-year prison term as a result of the government's wide investigation of illegal trading on Wall Street.    &quot;We are convinced that but for the accusations of Ivan Boesky, a convicted felon and admitted liar who is the principal source of the charges, there would be no action,&quot; Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said in a prepared statement. He said the firm doesn't know when the SEC might actually file charges, adding Drexel is &quot;eager to resolve this matter&quot; and to confront Mr. Boesky &quot;in a fair forum.&quot;    Mr. Anreder reiterated that an exhaustive internal investigation by Drexel has produced no evidence of any wrongdoing.    But in a memo to employees yesterday, Drexel indicated for the first time that it might enter into settlement negotiations with the SEC. In its memo, Drexel indicated that although it believed no one at the firm had done anything wrong, the case had reached a point where settlement of the charges could be beneficial. Drexel hasn't yet had any negotiations with the SEC about settling the case.    The memo also indicated that the SEC has approved charges against four Drexel employees. They are Mr. Milken, his brother Lowell, and two employees described as traders, according to people familiar with the charges. One of the two traders is said to be Pamela Monzert, who is employed in Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office and whose name hasn't previously been mentioned publicly in connection with the case.    Ms. Monzert, reached at her Santa Monica, Calif., home, declined comment and referred questions to her attorneys, who she said are the same as Drexel's. They declined comment.    The other trader is said to be Cary Maultasch, a trader who worked for Michael Milken in New York. Mr. Maultasch couldn't be reached, and his attorney, Charles Stillman, didn't return phone calls seeking comment.    In a settlement, the SEC can levy fines against a firm and require it to disgorge illegal trading profits; can censure, suspend or bar individuals from the securities business; and can force a firm to undertake major internal reforms. In return, the SEC allows a firm or individual to settle a case without admitting or denying guilt.    While an SEC settlement wouldn't necessarily have any impact on a criminal investigation, prosecutors may take a defendant's cooperation with the SEC into account when weighing the filing of criminal charges.    However, people familiar with the Drexel case cautioned that the SEC staff and Drexel views of the alleged wrongdoing and appropriate penalties are so far apart that a settlement currently seems unlikely.    The SEC action, while highly unusual, is expected to have little immediate impact on Drexel. No charges have been filed, and the SEC vote was expected, since the commission rarely overrules the recommendations of its enforcement staff.    But the SEC is likely to face criticism that it is unfairly subjecting Drexel and certain employees to public accusations to which they haven't had any opportunity to respond in court.    This appears to be the first time the SEC, which is believed to have authorized the complaint June 1, has subjected Drexel to different procedures than it has other prospective defendants. Alan Bromberg, an expert in securities law and a professor at Southern Methodist University, said the SEC's decision to approve charges but not file a complaint is &quot;unprecedented.&quot; He said that normally, such a vote is followed by the filing of a suit within a few days.    Both SEC Chairman David Ruder and SEC enforcement chief Gary Lynch repeatedly declined to comment on the Drexel matter.    This newspaper reported in January that Drexel had been notified by the enforcement staff that it had recommended broad charges against the firm, and Michael and Lowell Milken.    Drexel subsequently confirmed in disclosure documents filed with the SEC that the staff had recommended charges against the firm and key officials.    According to people familiar with the case, the charges approved by the SEC are substantially the same as those recommended by the enforcement staff in January. Drexel last winter responded with a voluminous submission, arguing that it shouldn't be charged with any wrongdoing. However, Drexel largely failed to dissuade the commission, people familiar with the case said. As previously reported, the SEC abandoned one aspect of the case involving the 1986 leveraged buy-out of Safeway Stores Inc.    The charges approved by the SEC involve an array of alleged securities-law violations, including misuse of inside information, &quot;parking&quot; of takeover-related securities to conceal their true ownership, disclosure violations, and falsification of books and records.    People familiar with the charges said the heart of the SEC's case involves a $5.3 million payment from Mr. Boesky's securities firm, Ivan F. Boesky Corp., to Drexel in March 1986. As previously reported, there is evidence that the payment was connected to an alleged stock parking scheme between Mr. Boesky and Michael Milken involving about 20 stocks, most of them takeover-related.    Although the SEC's charges appear to rely heavily on allegations by Mr. Boesky, people familiar with the case said that at least two matters aren't connected to Mr. Boesky. In other instances, they said, Mr. Boesky's assertions are corroborated by other witnesses and documents. Neither the SEC nor Drexel would identify any specific charges appproved by the SEC.    The SEC's decision to approve but not file charges was widely viewed as a victory for Rudolph Giuliani, the Manhattan U.S. attorney. Mr. Giuliani's office has been trying to restrain the commission from giving the Drexel and Milken defense camps the opportunity to begin discovery proceedings against the commission and Mr. Boesky.    Defendants in civil cases are entitled to broad access to evidence likely to be used against them; such discovery is much more restricted in criminal proceedings. For example, in an SEC case, Drexel and Mr. Milken's attorneys would be entitled to conduct a deposition of Mr. Boesky, who currently is in a prison in Lompoc, Calif. They wouldn't get any such advance opportunity to cross-examine him in any related criminal case.    By approving the complaint and notifying Drexel -- a step that securities lawyers say would have to be disclosed by Drexel in connection with any underwritings it undertakes -- the SEC may have quelled mounting pressure to demonstrate that it is making progress in the case, which has preoccupied its enforcement staff for nearly two years.    There wasn't any immediately discernible impact on Drexel's business from yesterday's disclosures. Many Wall Street executives shrugged off the news, saying SEC charges have been expected for some time. One major junk-bond investor, who asked not to be identified, said that unless the charges contain some startling new allegations, they shouldn't have any further effect on Drexel's operations. As previously reported, Drexel's net income fell about 79% in 1987 to $117 million.    In voting to move against Drexel but not immediately publicizing the charges, the SEC may have been responding to pressure from Capitol Hill to show some progress in the post-Boesky insider trading investigations.    In recent months there have been rumblings in Congress about those investigations apparently being stalled.    An aide to Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he doesn't expect lawmakers to criticize the SEC for voting to hold its charges against Drexel in abeyance. &quot;We wouldn't have problems with that,&quot; he said.    ---   Thomas E.
