Separately, the company reported a 47% jump in profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31 and boosted its quarterly dividend 8.3%.    Imasco, a tobacco, financial services, fast-food and drugstore concern, acquired San Francisco-based Genstar Corp., Canada Trustco's parent, for 2.61 billion dollars. Imasco's aim was to keep Toronto-based Canada Trustco, Canada's largest trust concern, and sell Genstar's remaining assets -- a range of businesses from cement to waste management.    In a final accounting, Imasco said net proceeds, after payment of debt and taxes, from the sale of Genstar's nonfinancial services assets totaled 382 million Canadian dollars. The total includes an unspecified value assigned to some Genstar assets that weren't sold.    The total also amounts to less than half of Imasco's initial estimate of 800 million dollars in net proceeds, a sum it reduced last summer to 600 million dollars.    An Imasco spokesman said the adjustment means that the Canada Trustco acquisition cost Imasco 2.2 billion dollars, rather than the anticipated 1.8 billion dollars. &quot;It's probably still a good deal,&quot; said a Toronto analyst who declined to be identitied, &quot;but not as good as it once was.&quot; In addition, Imasco assumed responsibility for a 300 million dollar preferred share issue by a Genstar unit.    Imasco said gross proceeds from the sales totaled about 2.8 billion dollars, but blamed the lower net proceeds on debt associated with certain real estate assets, contingent liabilities, higher taxes and lower values than initially estimated for certain assets.    Nonetheless, Imasco said it is pleased with the acquisition and noted that Canada Trustco's profit soared 61% last year.    Imasco, which has changed its financial year end to Dec. 31 from March 31, reported net income for the latest quarter of 97.8 million dollars, or 79 cents a share, compared with 66.5 million dollars, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier.    Revenue rose 8.7% to 1.36 billion dollars from 1.25 billion dollars.    Imasco said the improved results reflect higher profit at its Imperial Tobacco unit, Canada's largest cigarette maker, which had depressed earnings in the year-earlier period because of a price war. Profit also improved at its Canadian drugstore and newsstand units; at Hardee's Food Systems Inc., a U.S. fast-food unit, and at Canada Trustco. Peoples Drug Stores, a Virginia-based drugstore unit, returned to profitability after sustaining a loss in the year-earlier period.    Imasco raised its quarterly dividend to 26 cents a share from 24 cents, payable March 31 to stock of record Feb. 26.    Imasco shares closed yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 25.25 dollars, up 62.5 cents.    Imasco also said its Hardee's unit agreed to sell 279 of Hardee's 963 corporate-owned restaurant properties for $185 million to a joint venture in which Hardee's and New York-based Lepercq Capital Partners have equal stakes. Under terms of the transaction, which is expected to close later this month, Hardee's will lease back the outlets from the venture. Hardee's also has 1,949 franchises.    For the nine months, Imasco's net income rose 40% to 245 million dollars, or 1.96 dollars a share, from 175 million dollars, or 1.45 dollars a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.1% to 3.76 billion dollars from 3.51 billion dollars. </TEXT></DOC>
