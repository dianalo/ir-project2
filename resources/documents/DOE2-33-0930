Intermolecular effective ether cross-links,amine junction points, and extent of reaction of the amine and epoxyare measured for the polymerization. Chemical reactions in the epoxy-aminesystem are discussed, and the reactivity ratio of the epoxy-amine systemis calculated. Junction point measurements are made by the use of thedipolar dephasing relaxation experiment. The experimental data collectedwith C-13 NMR are then compared with the calculated data from a modeldeveloped in this laboratory. The information obtained in this studyis sufficient to calculate the molecular weight between cross-links.</TEXT></DOC>
