Church's, the nation's second-largest fried chicken restaurantchain and Popeyes, the No. 3 chain, agreed late Wednesday on abuyout, ending a four-month dispute that saw Church's take Popeyesto court, sell 120 unprofitable restaurants and put itself up forauction to avoid the hostile takeover.   The agreement calls for Popeyes owner Al Copeland to purchase upto 30.1 million shares, or about 86.5 percent of Church'soutstanding shares, for $11 per share.   Each share of Church's stock not purchased in the tender offerwill be converted to 0.44 share of a new series of preferred stockto be issued by the corporation that survives the merger. Thestatement did not say what the new company would be called.   Church's stock closed at $10.25 in New York Stock Exchangecomposite trading Thursday, up $1.25 a share.   Popeyes previously had offered about $290 million to take overthe ailing Church's, whose sales have been declining over the pastthree years.   The companies said the agreement, reached four days beforePopeyes' tender offer deadline, came about amicably.   ``I am pleased that we have agreed to this merger and believe itwill create a very strong No. 2 fast food fried chicken chain,''Church's president and chief executive officer Ernest Renaud said ina statement.   The companies' statement said that Canadian Imperial Bank ofCommerce has offered to provide up to $300 million and Merrill Lynchandamp; Co. has offered up to $178 million in financing for the tenderoffer.   Neither Renaud nor Copeland immediately returned telephonemessages Thursday to The Associated Press.   It was not known how many jobs might be lost as a result of themerger.   In documents submitted to a federal court during the takeoverprocess, Popeyes said that if it acquired Church's it would close250 Church's restaurants, keep 92 with the Church's name, rename 303others as Popeyes and sell 440 others for about $160 million overthe next four years.   Popeyes, with 703 restaurants, had been attempting since Novemberto take over Church's, a publicly held company with 1,478restaurants.   Even with a merger, the new company would lag behind No. 1.Kentucky Fried Chicken, which is owned by PepsiCo Inc., and whichhas annual sales of about $4 billion in its 7,000 restaurants.   Church's, founded in 1952 by George Church Sr., had grownsteadily over the years, but internal bickering, including aleveraged buyout attempt, and other management and marketingproblems the last several years began taking its toll on the company.   Church's sales have gone down steadily, from $639 million infiscal year 1985 to $577 in 1986 and $533 in 1987. Popeyes,meanwhile, started by Copeland 15 years ago, is expected to havesales about $480 million this year.   During the takeover attempt, Church's sued Popeyes, arguing thatformer Church's executives working for Popeyes took with theminformation that was used in the buyout proposal. Church's alsoadopted a ``poison pill'' takeover defense that would make it moredifficult to carry out a hostile takeover.   Federal judges in San Antonio and New Orleans had sided withPopeyes.</TEXT></DOC>
