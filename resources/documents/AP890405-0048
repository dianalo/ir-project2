(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A scientist found cancer-fighting fattychemicals in cheese and grilled ground beef, but says it's noexcuse for people to go stuff themselves on cheeseburgers.   ``People should be reassured to know there are things in foodthat prevent cancer,'' said microbiologist Michael Pariza, whoconducted the research as director of the University of Wisconsin'sfood safety research institute.   But saturated fats and cholesterol also found in beef and cheesehave been linked previously to heart disease and some cancers.   So ``we're certainly not suggesting that people go out and chowdown on cheese and hamburgers,'' Pariza said Tuesday during theAmerican Cancer Society's science writers' seminar.   He said fears of cancer-causing substances in food wereaggravated by recent reports of Alar in apples and aflatoxin ingrain, as well as a 1986 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratorystudy that found well-done fried and broiled hamburgers containchemicals that cause cancer and mutations in rodents.   Pariza said his findings show that ``in many foods there aregood substances that may counteract the effect of bad substances.That's why it's a good idea to eat a balanced diet.''   His study found varying amounts of the cancer-inhibiting fattyacids _ called CLA, or conjugated linoleic acids _ in hamburger andnatural and processed cheeses. Highest levels were in Cheese Whizsandwich spread, followed by grilled hamburger.   Pariza, worried about public reaction to his study, said thattwo men whose wives are dying of cancer called him and ``wanted toknow if their wives should eat more Cheese Whiz.'' He told them no.   American Heart Association spokesman Howard Lewis also expressedconcern people might overinterpret the research by eating too muchcheese and meat.   To prevent heart disease, the group recommends a balanced dietof fresh fruit and vegetables and foods low in cholesterol andsaturated fat. Those include low-fat cheeses and lean meat trimmedof excess fat, Lewis said by phone from Dallas.   ``If you eat a high-fiber, low-fat diet, the health benefits faroutweigh the benefits of any CLA you can get through eating a lotof beef and cheese,'' said Dr. Vincent DeVita Jr., former NationalCancer Institute director.   Pariza said the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board paid aboutone-third of his laboratory's costs, but only for the last twoyears of the 10-year research effort. The cancer institute providedmost of the funds, he said.   Dr. John Laszlo, the cancer society's senior vice president,defended the quality of Pariza's research. He said it raises thepossibility that CLA someday might be given to people to helpprevent cancer. Pariza emphasized much more research is needed tolearn if that would work.   Pariza's discovery that CLA in hamburger can inhibit cancer``illustrates what an oversimplification it is to makepronouncements about diet and cancer,'' Laszlo added.   At the time of the 1986 report that hamburger contains chemicalsthat cause cancer in mice, scientists said the risk to humans wasunknown. But as a precaution they recommended against cooking meatwell-done.   Pariza's early studies also found carcinogens in cooked meat,but a few years ago he found a crude extract from grilled hamburgerthat was able to inhibit skin cancer in mice exposed to a potentcancer-causing chemical.   In his latest research, he purified and identified CLA inextracts of cheeses and grilled hamburger.   One group of mice was given CLA and a second group received noneof the substance. All the mice were later fed a strong doses of acancer-causing chemical.   This was repeated weekly for four weeks, and the mice werekilled after 20 weeks. Mice that received CLA and the carcinogenaveraged two tumors in the forestomach, compared with five tumorsin mice that got only the carcinogen.   CLA has been known for 50 years, and occurs naturally in humanblood and mother's milk and in most animal products, Pariza said,adding that his research revealed its cancer-fighting properties.   He theorizes CLA inhibits cancer by blocking damage tochromosomes, or basic hereditary information in all cells, causedby chemicals called oxygen free radicals.   Previous research found cancer-inhibiting chemicals in carrots,broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, beans, nuts and certainother foods.</TEXT></DOC>
