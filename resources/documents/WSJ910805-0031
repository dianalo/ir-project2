Demand for lithium is growing worldwide, because it can beused as a refrigerant that doesn't release thechlorofluorocarbon gases thought to harm the atmosphere'sozone layer. Japan currently depends on imports for all ofits lithium supplies, he said.</LP><TEXT>   The research brought development of beads that captureparticles of lithium as seawater passes over them. But theofficial said the cost of the method makes commercialdevelopment unlikely unless there is strong demand for thesystem.   Tests showed that 20 milligrams of lithium could beextracted from one gram of seawater using the absorbentbeads. The ministry's lab involved in the research is theShikoku Island-based Government Industrial ResearchInstitute.</TEXT></DOC>
