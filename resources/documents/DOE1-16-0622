A conceptualdiscussion is presented which allows the specification to be met by themodels for the prediction of the effects of the emplacement of a highlevel waste repository located at a depth of 500 m in a granitic rock.Furthermore, the radionuclides giving the largest contribution to theradiological impact are identified.</TEXT></DOC>
