 The Macintosh hasnot been a hotbed of sales for database products, especially not for high-enddevelopment products.andP;  Does that make the Mac a database weakling?andP;  Not achance.andP;  High-end Mac database vendors, not the Mac's underlying technology,carry the blame there.andM;The unmistakable reality, of course, is that the Mac oozes all the rightstuff for real database work: easily accessible floating-point processing; agraphics interface that makes entry forms, reports and customized screenseasy to create; plenty of CPU to sort, manipulate and modify records; andbeaucoup networking options to handle interoperability issues with databaseson workstation networks and bigger iron.andP;  Not to mention first-rate SQL, 3270and VAX support.andM;In addition to the Mac's accessible technical superiority as a databaseplatform, Jim, you also can't deny the plethora of first-rate databasesoftware that runs only on the Mac.andM;Let's read a short honor roll of Mac database applications: Claris Corp.'sFileMaker Pro (simply the best flat-file database for small businesses),ACIUS Inc.'s 4th Dimension (the most complete, powerful and extensiblerelational-database development system available on any computer) andOdesta's Double Helix (the easiest-to-use relational database on the planet).andM;Where are the DOS, Windows or OS/2 databases to compare with these Macintoshstalwarts?andP;  Still waiting to be invented, unfortunately.andM;Finally, Jim, don't just take my word for it.andP;  Talk to the databaseconsultants.andP;  Talk to the micro managers.andP;  Talk to the small-business owners.andO;They'll tell you the same thing they've told me.andP;  If you need to build anduse a database, regardless of its sophistication or simplicity, the Maccombines the best in hardware technology, operating system, GUI, networkingsupport and available software.andM;No amount of overweening DOS arrogance or whining about market share is goingto change that fact.andM;Don Crabb is director of laboratories and senior lecturer for the departmentof computer science at the University of Chicago.andP;  He is also a MacWEEKcontributing editor.andM;Besides general business applications, Mac databases are used most foraccounting and finance, training, Randamp;D, and sales and marketing.andP;  Aboutone-fifth of sites bought customized database systems, evenly divided betweencommercial vertical software and custom-programmed applications.andP;  In aboutone-quarter of the sites, consultants were called for programming,maintenance and user support.andM;The tools available for database management on the Macintosh have expanded innumber and feature depth in the past two years.andP;  Here are historical capsulesand review summaries of each of the major players, emphasizing theirstrengths for use in corporate, multivendor environments.andM;Flat-file databasesandM;File 2.0andM;Microsoft Corp.andM;1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, Wash.andP;
