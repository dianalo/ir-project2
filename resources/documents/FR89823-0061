(Northern), 1400 Smith Street, P.O. Box 1188, Houston, Texas77251-1188, filed in Docket No. CP89-1948-000 a request pursuant to andSection;157.205 of the Commission's Regulations for authorization to provide transportationservice on behalf of Adobe Gas Marketing Co.

El Paso Natural Gas Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP89-1909-000]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">August 15, 1989.</ITAG>Take notice that on August 4, 1989, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso),Post Office Box 1492, El Paso, Texas, 79978, filed an application in DocketNo. CP89-1909-000, under sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act,for an optional certificate of public convenience and necessity (OEC) authorizing(i) the construction and operation of certain facilities, with appurtenances;(ii) the firm transportation certificate and (iii) conditional pregrantedabandonment of the facilities and related application on file with theCommission and open to public inspection.The application states that El Paso proposes to expand its interstate pipelinesystem by up to 600 MMcf/d, primarily to meet principal market area ofCalifornia. The expansion will serve shippers desiring firm transportationservice for gas to be delivered at or in the vicinity of the western terminusof El Paso's mainline system at Topock, Arizona, including shippers engagedin enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations in central California.El Paso's expanded system would be connected at or near El Paso's Topockdelivery point with the existing utility systems of Pacific Gas and ElectricCompany and Southern California Gas Company, as well as with the facilitiesto be constructed and operated by Mojave Pipeline Company, for the ultimatedelivery of gas to shippers utilizing such systems, principally EOR andassociated cogeneration users operating in the heavy oil fields in KernCounty, California.El Paso further states that its proposal has been prompted more specificallyby several recent developments which evidence a substantial market interestin the facilities and service which are the subject of the instant application.Among these are: (i) The California Public Utilities Commission's ongoinginvestigation into the need for new interstate pipeline capacity to andwithin California which, while not yet complete, has thus far resultedin substantial market support for, and regulatory interest in, the constructionof new interstate pipeline capacity and new firm interstate transportationfor service not only to the EOR market, but also to enhance service levelsto existing California gas consumers; (ii) the continuing market viabilityof the Mojave project; and (iii) El Paso's continuing discussions and negotiationswith EOR and other gas consumers in California regarding new transportationservices.El Paso states that it has executed agreements with several EOR users whichprovide for long-term firm transportation commitments on El Paso's systemup to an aggregate maximum quantity of approximately 225,000 MMbtu perday. El Paso states it is also presently engaged in ongoing negotiationswith additional potential firm shippers in California, including EOR users,regarding future firm transportation arrangements, and anticipates thatadditional commitments for firm transportation service on Applicant's systemwould be secured in the near future.Because the total transportation market to be served by El Paso is notyet clear due to the ongoing nature of its negotiations, El Paso's applicationpresents illustrative engineering studies based on three (3) design alternatives:The 200 Case presents the minimum expenditures by El Paso for additionalfacilities only on the San Juan Mainline System necessary to transportand deliver 200 MMcf/d; the 400 Case presents a design alternative whichwould permit the initial transportation and delivery of 400 MMcf/d, expandableto 600 MMcf/d; and the 600 Case reflects the facilities necessary to permitEl Paso to transport and delivery 600 MMcf/d. The facilities El Paso willactually construct will match the level of firm commitments, but not inexcess of the 600 MMcf/d level. Each of the design alternatives incorporatescompatible engineering design considerations relative to the constructionof Mojave Pipeline Company's proposed interstate pipeline system extendingfrom Topock, Arizona, to Kern County, California. El Paso estimates thatthe facility cost for each of the three (3) cases are $68,708,000, $143,670,000and $201,035,000, respectively. El Paso seeks flexible authorization toconstruct and implement facilities necessary to provide its proposed serviceat the aggregate level ultimately secured through negotiations.El Paso further states that it will perform the proposed firm transportationservice under the provisions of its existing Rate Schedule T-3, containedin its FERC Gas Tariff, Original Volume No. 1-A, and consistent with thegeneral terms and conditions contained in such tariff and applicable tothis service. Use of the existing Rate Schedule T-3 rate structure involvesrolling-in the incremental costs of the new construction with the existingrate base. El Paso states that its Rate Schedule T-3 includes a reservationcharge, and also a one-part volumetric rate based on an assumed throughputof 95% of design capacity. El Paso states that its T-3 rate is cost-basedand has prescribed maximum and minimum levels. In addition, El Paso states,its Rate Schedule T-3 has an established priority queue based on requestsfor future service that was compiled on a first come, first served basis.El Paso states that rolled-in treatment is appropriate in this case because(i) with the additional looping Applicant can reduce the existing isolatedinstances of underutilized mainline capacity and thus provide additionalfirm service to Topock without adversely affecting service to existingcustomers (enhances efficiency); and (ii) the additional throughput resultingwould have a positive cost impact on existing customers. El Paso statesthat the new capacity would be available to those shippers in the firmqueue and to any new shippers securing a position in such queue. El Pasostates that it believes it would be able to accommodate the requirementsof all potential firm shippers, irrespective of the position held in thequeue.El Paso states that the EOR customers provide a maximum assurance of constantthroughput which is particularly valuable to El Paso's existing customersbecause an associated increase in the total system throughput redoundsto the benefit of those customers. The application states that El Pasois cognizant that existing pipeline customers should not bear any of thepresent or future risk associated with recovery of the OEC facility costs.That risk, however minimal in this case, must rest on the pipeline and/ornew shippers. El Paso states that it does not seek to avoid or evade therequired assumption of this risk and is fully prepared to accept the responsibilityfor recovery (or non-recovery) of the capital and operational costs associatedwith the new facilities for which certificate authority is requested inthis application.With respect to the three (3) design alternatives, El Paso has includedin its environmental assessment identification of those exceptions to theprior environmental report contained in the application filed November8, 1985, as amended, in Docket No. CP86-197-000, <T3>et al.</T3> These exceptions do not, in the opinion of El Paso, constitutea major federal action which will necessitate another environmental impactstatement.El Paso has also requested, pursuant to andSection; 157.103(f), conditionalpregranted abandonment authority to abandon the services which are undertakenand/or the facilities which are constructed pursuant to the certificateauthority requested herein.<T3>Comment date:</T3> September 5, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Standard Paragraphs</ITAG>F.
