But the two states are still a longway from a merger.   The two Germanys have belonged to hostile East-West camps sincethe postwar occupation following the defeat of Nazi Germany in1945. Their drawing together in economic, social and culturalmatters now seems inevitable because of the remarkable changes thathave swept East Germany's Communist system in recent weeks.   Yet a complete reunification of East and West Germany will behard to achieve. Here are some of the reasons:   _ Defense requirements of the Soviet Union and the United Statespreclude the total withdrawal of NATO and Warsaw Pact troops fromthe Germanys at present. This would seem to be an essentialprecondition for reunification.   _ A backlash is possible from West Germans, particularly thosein lower-income groups who feel economically threatened, againstthe tide of refugees. This year alone, authorities expect 700,000new arrivals in West Germany _ including 200,000 East Germans, aswell as ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union and Poland andasylum-seekers from other countries.   _ The question remains whether East Germans, after four decadesof living in a highly subsidized, albeit shortage-plagued economy,will want to jettison socialism to embrace capitalism, with all thefoibles of the free marketplace.   Although the West German constitution of 1949 embraces the goalof German unity and guarantees West German citizenship to allpeople of German descent, the country already has a criticalhousing problem and faces labor tensions caused by chronicunemployment, now at 1.9 million, more than 7 percent. With 61million people crowded into a country the size of Oregon, WestGermans are increasingly worried how this flood of newcomers willeffect their pocketbooks.   This concern was underlined in a television comment Thursday bya West German youth, who declared in reaction to the opening of theBerlin Wall: ``The Federal Republic is not a country ofimmigrants.''   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who was visiting Warsaw when EastGermany threw open the barrier on Thursday, said West Germany'sinterest ``must be that our compatriots stay in their homeland.''   The superpowers' security interests would have to be worked outbefore any complete reunfication could occur. The Soviets haveupwards of 400,000 troops stationed in East Germany _ thecornerstone of the Warsaw Pact alliance _ and the United States has250,000 troops in West Germany.   Another consideration is the European Economic Community's planto eliminate virtually all trade barriers in Western Europe in 1992.   Provision would have to be made to include East Germany in thenew ``open border'' trading system, although East Germany alreadyenjoys a privileged trading relationship with Bonn.   French Premier Michel Rochard said Thursday he would not opposeEast German membership in the EEC, but he advocated carefulnegotiations beforehand.   Reunification could lead to the prospect of disarmament, or atleast massive cuts in German armed forces. This would raise theissue of guarantees for Germany's security _ and whether a powerfulGerman state would settle for such assurances from other countries.   George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev could decide to reduce troopsin both Germanys at their summit meeting next month as aconfidence-building gesture. But West Europeans, while praising thesudden turn of events in East Germany, harbor suspicions of aunified Germany that would be a politically and economicallydominant force in Europe.   And citizens of the Soviet Union, mindful of its staggeringlosses in two world wars, have real concern about a resurgentGermany.   On Friday, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimovpraised East German reforms, but said any speculation about areunified Germany is ``out of the question.''   Certainly nothing can happen before the Communist elite of EastGermany permits a fundamental change: free elections that couldturn it out of government leadership. This would be tantamount todumping the authoritarian system that has ruled with total controlfor 40 years.   While it is true that Poland and Hungary have abandoned the``leading role'' of the Communist Party in their countries, theEast German hierarchy has shown no willingness to do the same.   Many of the East German opposition groups that have sprung up inrecent weeks have emphasized that they want to preserve socialism,not replace it with a capitalist system.   By giving citizens the opportunity to travel to the West andpurchase goods not available at home, East German leaders haveprovided a much-needed outlet for frustrations, and probablyrescued their system from an explosion.   But a crackdown like that which ended democratic dreams in Chinalast June cannot be ruled out. East German leader Egon Krenzpraised the Chinese government for crushing the pro-democracymovement when he visited Bejing this summer.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: The writer is deputy news editor of the AP WorldService Division in New York and covered European politics from1969 to 1985 as an AP correspondent in West Germany and the SovietUnion.</TEXT></DOC>
