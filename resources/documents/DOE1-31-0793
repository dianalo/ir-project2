<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-31-0793 </DOCNO><TEXT>NET is envisaged to form, in the European fusion development program,the link between the present-day NET and the following Fusion DemonstrationReactor. The main performance objectives are: the ignition margin, theburn pulse duration and the testing capabilities. The most importantdesign parameters are listed. The operation schedule compromises differentstages, e.g. one to maximize the physics capability and another to testtwo design iterations of a blanket concept. At the end of the operationthe machine will have accumulated 10/sup 5/ cycles and 400 days of integratedoperating time corresponding to 0,8 MWy/m/sup 2/ of neutron fluence.Then selection of workable contenders for all DEMO components will bepossible. Conceptually the machine is devided into 1) a relatively permanentstructure, the support structure, the main vacuum containment and shieldingand 2) removable and exchangeable parts such as divertor plates, blanketand first wall. The problems as seen from the present state of knowledgeare outlined in connection with the particular parts. Finally, commentson the magnets, the blanket and the first wall/divertor are made. 3 figs.(qui).</TEXT></DOC>
