It is shownthat the magnetic behavior is that of a granular type-II superconductorin which strongly superconducting grains are coupled via less superconductinglinks. As a result, at low-H (Happrox. andless;20 Oe at 4.2 K) the sample appearslike a single superconducting filament while at high enough field (Happrox.andgt;5 kOe) it behaves like a granular superconductor with most of the weaklinks being broken by the applied field. Five threshold fields are identifiedcharaterizing the above magnetic regimes and the transition between them.It is concluded that the critical current density within the individualgrains could attain 10{sup 7} A/cm{sup 2}.</TEXT></DOC>
