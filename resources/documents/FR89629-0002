Since this rule only defines the requirements of OBRA,it does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) result in a major increase in costs or prices to consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; (3) result in significant adverse affects on competition, employment,investment or productivity, and therefore, has been determined to be ``notmajor.''  REA has concluded that promulgation of this rule does not represent a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentunder the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, (42 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>), and therefore, does not require an environmental impactstatement or an environmental assessment. This rule is a categorical exclusionunder REA's 7 CFR Part 1794, Environmental Policies and Procedures (<T3>i.e.,</T3> 7 CFR 1794.31(b)(17)).

Forthe reasons set forth in the Final Rule related Notice to 7 CFR Part 3015,Subpart V in 50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985, this program is excluded fromthe scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultationwith State and local officials.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Background  </ITAG>On December 22, 1987, Section 312, Use of Funds, was added to the RE Act.Congress expressed concern that REA borrowers were restricted in theirability to make needed investments in rural community infrastructure projects(such as water and waste systems, garbage collection services, etc.) andin job creation activities (such as providing technical, financial, managerialassistance) and other activities to promote business development in ruralcommunities. By section 312, Congress directed REA to replace its traditional3 percent policy with a 15 percent limit as a small incremental contributionto rebuilding a more diversified economy in rural communities. The legislativehistory surrounding the enactment of section 312 is clear that Congressintended that the new permitted level of investments should not in anyway put government funds at risk or impair a borrower's ability to repayits indebtedness.  On November 28, 1988, REA published a proposed rule in 53 FR 47820 to amend7 CFR Chapter XVII by adding a new Part 1715, Criteria for Securing REAApprovals Required Under the Mortgage by Electric Borrowers Relating toFinancial and Management Matters consisting of Subpart B, andSection;andSection;1715.20-1715.28, Investments, Loans and Guarantees by Electric Borrowers.REA invited interested parties to file comments on or before January 27,1989.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>REA received 7 written comments from the following:<ITAG tagnum="15">(1) National Rural Electric Cooperative Association</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(3) Oglethorpe Power Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(4) Basin Electric Power Cooperative</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(5) Garkane Power Association, Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(6) Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(7) Blue Ridge Electric Corporation</ITAG>All received comments were considered in preparing the final rule. Thesecomments are addressed in the following paragraphs, along with REA's positionon each comment and/or a discussion of REA's modification to the proposedrule.Three of the seven organizations responding gave unequivocal support tothe rule as written.One comment suggested that REA take an activist role in offering adviceto borrowers in investment activities. REA does not believe that the RuralElectrification Act authorizes the agency to act as an investment adviserto its borrowers and REA does not believe that it is appropriate to actin this role. Consequently, responsibility for making investment decisionswill remain with the borrowers. REA encourages its borrowers to obtaincompetent investment advice by using qualified professional staff and byconsulting trained investment advisors.Three comments suggested revising the general rule in order to clarifyits meaning or more closely follow what the commentators considered tobe the intent of section 312 of the Act. As written, andSection; 1715.23is intended to constitute the written consent under existing mortgagesof REA which require approval for certain investments in excess of 3 percentof a borrower's total utility plant. Accordingly, REA does not believethat individual written consents from REA are necessary for borrowers tobe able to invest their own funds, make loans, or guarantees up to 15 percentof their total utility plant. REA believes that andSection; 1715.23, as originallyproposed, clearly states a general rule which is consistent with section312 of the Act. Thus, REA is making no changes in andSection; 1715.23.One comment from a financial institution objected to REA's statement ofpolicy because section 312 of the Act did not limit the discretion grantedto a borrower to invest, make loans, or guarantees only to instances wherethe activities are directed toward rural development. REA agrees that thelanguage of section 312 omits such limitation but points out that the legislativehistory of section 312 clearly evidences a congressional intention thatborrowers will use their new latitude primarily to stimulate economic developmentin their own communities. Accordingly, REA believes that it is both authorizedand appropriate to adopt a policy statement encouraging borrowers to exercisetheir broader latitude under section 312 in this manner. However, andSection;1715.23 of the rule (the section which operates as the written REA consentcalled for in REA mortgages) omits any reference to investment purposes.Thus,borrowers are encouraged by REA to invest in rural development, but arenot required by the rule to do so.The above commentator also objected to REA's policy that investment activity``not in any way put government * * * security at risk.'' This commentatorinterpreted the policy statement as a restriction which would precludevirtually all investment and guarantee activity since REA's security interesttypically includes funds used to make investments or funds that would beused to honor a guarantee. REA disagrees with this interpretation. Themere existence of an REA security interest in a borrower's funds will notpreclude investment and guarantee activity that is otherwise permissibleunder andSection; 1715.23 of this subpart. On the other hand, a borrower'sobligation to make timely payments on loans made or guarnateed by REA isnot excused because of any financial or liquidity problems associated withactivities authorized under andSection; 1715.23. The policy statement makesit clear that although REA considers rural development to be a laudableobjective, REA affords timely loan repayment and adequate loan securityhigher priority. REA believes that the policy as proposed is authorizedand appropriate when viewed in the context of the legislative history ofsection 312 and the rule as an entirety. Nevertheless, REA is revisingthe language of andSection; 1715.21 to clarify that the statement is oneof policy and not a legal restriction.Four of the comments disagreed with various elements of the definitions(andSection; 1715.22) either because they thought certain definitions containedambiguities or were overly restrictive. After considering the comments,REA is revising the definition of ``invest'' by replacing the broad referenceto assets, ``which are not expected to be used or useful in furnishingelectrical service'' with the more precise term ``and includes all financialtransactions recorded on the borrower's books and records in investmentaccounts, as those accounts are used in the Uniform System of Accountsfor REA Borrowers.'' This provision makes it clear that section 312 isnot intended to authorize a borrower to make extensions to its electricsystem in contravention of REA limitations by characterizing them as ``investments.''One commentator also suggested that this definition be revised by eliminatingthe reference to earning a financial return. REA believes that the expectationof earning a financial return is an integral part of the meaning of theterm ``invest,'' and thus is retaining that element of the definition.Three comments suggested that the definition of ``own funds'' be changed,each in a different way. One wanted the definition changed to clarify thatloan fund proceeds which have been advanced to a borrower (as reimbursementfor plant costs temporarily financed by the borrower with general funds)would be considered to be the borrower's ``own funds.'' REA believes thedefinition is clear that such funds are the borrower's ``own funds.'' Thus,REA believes that no change is needed. This commentator sought a similarmodification for each of the other elements in this definition, apparentlyfor clarification. REA believes that the definition as originally proposedis clear.One comment suggested that the definition of ``own funds'' be modifiedto classify ``own funds'' as any funds which a borrower may receive fromsale proceeds which exceed book value. REA thinks that such a definitionwould be difficult to administer and would create in every case (wherea borrower has sold property) a factual question about whether the fundsso invested were attributable to the proceeds in excess of book cost. Thesuggestion would also be inconsistent with REA's long-standing approachof valuing loan collateral on a system-wide basis, as contrasted with aproject-by-project or line-by-line basis. REA does not wish in this ruleto abandon its established practice of requiring that proceeds from salesof mortgaged property be applied either towards retirement of debt or tosystem improvements and extensions. Should REA consider changing its policyin this regard, it will do so in a different rule concerning asset sales.One comment, while admitting that Congress presumably did not intend forborrowers to otherwise invest funds that would be necessary for timelydebt repayments, objected to the exclusion of those funds necessary tomake timely payments of principal and interest on loans made, guaranteed,or lien accommodated by REA from the definition of ``own funds''. If thisinterpretation were chosen, a borrower could invest cash which is necessaryto make timely payments of principal and interest on loans made, guaranteed,or lien accommodated by REA. Also, if this interpretation were chosen,a borrower could invest cash necessary to make timely loan repayments innon-liquid, long-term investments causing it to default on its REA mortgageobligations. In such circumstances. REA would be effectively forced toacquiesce in the default or liquidate mortgage collateral, including theseinvestments, at less than the face amount of the debt. REA anticipatesthat such a borrower might even assert in defense of its conduct, thatREA consented to such activity by section 312 of the Act and andSection;1715.23 of this rule. In support of its position, the commentator citeda statement in the House Report No. 391(I), 100th Cong. 1st Sess. 20) tothe effect that investments less than 15 percent of total utility plantshould not in any way put government funds or security interest at risk.Apparently, the commentator views the report language as a conclusion.Since the report contained no basis for such a sweeping conclusion, REAinterprets the statement to be a directive. Accordingly, REA sees no conflictbetween the latitude given to borrowers to invest their own funds and anadministrative interpretation that when payment is due, funds needed fordebt service are no longer the borrower's ``own funds'' as that phraseis used in section 312 of the RE Act.One comment objected to the definition of ``Total Utility Plant'' becauseit is limited to total electric utility plant. Although section 312 usesthe term ``total utility plant,'' it does not define the term nor doesthe legislative history amplify its meaning. However, section 312 is, byits express terms, limited to borrowers of ``electric'' loans. The overwhelmingmajority of electric borrowers have no utility plant which is not electricutility plant. Therefore, REA thinks that the reference in section 312to an electric program borrower's total utility plant means the total electricutility plant of that borrower and has so defined the term. The definitionof total utility plant does not restrict borrowers from investing in otherutilities if they chose to do so. Thus, for most REA electric progam borrowers,the definition makes no difference. For the limited number of REA programborrowers which operate more than one utility service, this interpretationwill preclude such borrowers from leveraging the amount of unrestrictedinvestments they otherwise could make by acquiring controlling interestsin other utilities and then including the value of such utilities in thecomputation of ``total utility plant'' for the purposes of section 312.One comment suggested that REA delete the definition of subsidiary andremove the requirement in andSection; 1715.25(b) that subjects the recordsof borrowers to auditing procedures prescribed in 7 CFR Part 1789. As definedin this rule, a subsidiary is another organization which the borrower controls.Thus, the borrower is in a position to cause its subsidiary to make recordsavailable and to comply with REA accounting requirements. REA considersthese requirements to be justifiable in furthering its obligations underthe Act to see that loans made or guaranteed by it remain adequately securedand that such loans are repaid in accordance with their terms. The commentatorconceded that REA might have such authority under other statutory provisionsor agreements but objected to REA's inclusion in this rule as a conditionfor exercising investment and guarantee authority. However, the recordsand accounting requirements in andSection; 1715.25(b) do not condition theability of borrowers to make investments or guarantees under section 312.REA inserted these requirements in this rule at andSection; 1715.25(b) becauseREA is broadening the scope of its financial monitoring in response tothe increased level of investment, loan, and guarantee activity generatedby section 312.REA received a few comments objecting to the exclusions in andSection; 1715.24.Generally these objections were based on two grounds. First, a belief thatsection 321 prevents the Administrator from changing in any way REA's administrativepractices concerning investments, loan and guarantee activities exceptto make them more permissive than they were when section 312 was enacted.While section 312 and its legislative history show an unmistakable intentionto raise the level of unclassified investments, loans and guarantees requiringprior REA approval from 3 percent to 15 percent, the language of section312 does not impose any limitation on the discretion of the Administratorto restrict such activities when they exceed 15 percent of a borrower'stotal utility plant. Accordingly, REA does not agree with comments suggestingthat section 312 precludes the Administrator from reconsidering whetherinvestments, loans and guarantees that were not subject to REA approvalunder REA's past administrative practices should be restricted when theyexceed 15 percent of a borrower's total utility plant. REA believes thatsection 312 does not address this issue and thus leaves the Administrator'sauthority under the RE Act unchanged in this respect. Second, some objectionsnoted that the existing REA mortgages were multiparty agreements and thusin proposing to restrict certain investments that had previously been unrestricted,REA was exceeding its authority under the terms of existing legal agreements,i.e. REA mortgages, by in effect amending them unilaterally. In responseto this second argument, REA has modified andSection; 1715.24 to permit borrowersto continue to make investments, loans and guarantees without prior REAapproval in circumstances where such approval is not required under theirexisting REA mortgages.As a result of the above change, paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) in andSection;1715.24 which proposed specific uniform exclusions have been limited inthe final rule to those instances where REA is making a new loan or guaranteeand the co-mortgagees, if any, consent to the modification of the REA mortgage.Those paragraphs have been further modified to limit the exclusion of thoseinvestments from the computation only in those instances where the borrowerpledges those investments under the REA mortgage. In those limited instanceswhere such assets may not be pledged, e.g., restricted stock, borrowerscould still make such investments but they would be subject to the 15 percentrestriction expressed in the general rule. Paragraph (d) in andSection; 1715.24excluding certain commitments incurred prior to the original mortgage hasbeen deleted from the final rule since it is unnecessary in the case ofexisting mortgages which contain a similar provision and unnecessary forfuture mortgages since the authorization of 15 percent in section 312 ofthe RE Act provides ample authority of the very limited number of borrowersthat have this type of commitment.The final rule now clearly permits the continuation of borrower investmentsin securities of CFC, the National Bank for Cooperatives and the SaintPaul Bank for Cooperatives as excluded investments in determining compliancewith andSection; 1715.23 of the rule. The rule also clarifies that permittedexclusions in andSection; 1715.24 are the same as those in a borrower's currentmortgage.REA does not agree with comments suggesting that the passage of section312 in effect statutorily ``froze'' existing REA mortgage provisions dealingwith this subject. Accordingly, a new paragraph (d) has been added to andSection;1715.24 to make it clear that REA is not adopting this interpretation.REA is reserving in andSection; 1715.24 its historic right to make case bycase revisions in REA mortgages in connection with any new REA financialassistance. To clarify the interaction of the currently existing Mortgageprovisions with the requirements of this Rule, an Appendix is includedwith the Rule to set forth a hypothetical example of how andSection;andSection;1715.23 and 1715.24 would apply.One respondent requested REA to be specific in determining the amount availablefor investing, if a borrower must include the unrecovered investments (losseson investments and guarantees) in determining its future compliance withthe rule. REA accepts the request, and has added a new paragraph (d) toandSection; 1715.25, Records, to clarify this determination to assure that:(1) Losses occurring on an investment will not be counted against the 15percent in future calculations, and (2) an investment which is ``rolledover'' is not accumulated or counted against the 15 percent in future calculation,but rather treated as only one investment. This is accomplished by requiringthe borrower to use the amounts actually reflected on it books and recordsfor the investments.The final rule will become effective thirty days after its publication.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1715</ITAG>Electric power, Loan programs-energy, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Rural areas.In view of the above, REA hereby amends 7 CFR Chapter XVII by adding anew Part 1715 consisting of Subpart B (andSection;andSection; 1715.20-1715.28)to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1715_CRITERIA FOR SECURING REA APPROVALS REQUIRED UNDER THE MORTGAGEBY ELECTRIC BORROWERS RELATING TO FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT MATTERS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Investments, Loans, and Guarantees by Electric Borrowers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1715.20 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1715.21 Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1715.22 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1715.23 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1715.24 Exclusions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1715.25 Records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1715.26 Effect of this subpart on REA loan contract and mortgage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1715.27 Restrictions imposed by other lenders.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1715.28 Investments, loans, and guarantees in excess of 15 percentof Total Utility Plant.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 7 U.S.C. 901-950b; Title I, Subtitle D, sec. 1402,Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub.

It has invested $100,000 in CapitalTerm Certificates of The National Rural Utilities Finance Cooperative (CFC)in order to become a member of CFC (ii). It has also purchased ``SubscriptionTerm Certificates'' (STC's) issued by CFC and bearing interest at 3 percent(ii). The STC's were purchased from CFC in the amount of 5 percent of a$25,000,000 long term loan (i.e. $125,000) pursuant to CFC lending requirements.The Co-op has also invested $10,000,000 in surplus general funds in CFC'scommercial paper program and CFC has issued its note to the Co-op to evidencethe investment (ii). The Co-op is a member of a generation and transmissioncooperative (Gandamp;T) from which it purchases electricity for distributionto its members. The Gandamp;T routinely allocates a portion of its net marginsto the Co-op as one of its members. The Gandamp;T has allocated capital creditsof $250,000 to the Co-op but has not yet distributed them (iii). In 1971the Co-op borrowed $200,000 on an unsecured basis from a local lender whichis due in full in 1991 and so notified REA in writing prior to the executionof its REA mortgage in May of 1973 (iv). The Co-op has invested $15,000to purchase land for an industrial park (v). Except for the amount of theCo-op's bank deposit which exceeds FDIC insurance coverage and the investmentin the industrial park, all of the foregoing are excluded for purposesof determining compliance with andSection; 1715.23.
