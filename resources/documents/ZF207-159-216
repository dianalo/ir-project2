 Naval Academy inAnnapolis, Md., to link the personal computers of 4,600 midshipmen to nearly60 othe computers and defense networks on campus through a custom-made NavalAcademy Data Network (NADN).andM;TRW's Information Networks Division, located in Torrance, Calif., is in thesecond and last phase of a $10 million government contract to provide video,voice and data services across the academy's 40 campus buildings, accordingto Willis Marti, the TRW division's project manager.andM;All told, the project will use eight-wire, twisted-pair cabling to link some10,000 ports with 15 existing computer systems--including VAXes--and 42 newcomputer systems to be provided by TRW.andP;  At least 18 buildings will be on amajor fiber-optic backbone, according to M.G.H.andP;  Smart, the Naval Academycommander.andM;&quot;A lot of the goal is for the midshipmen to sit in their rooms and be able toconnect to any professor's computer and submit their homework,&quot; she said.andO;&quot;They can't say the dog ate it.&quot;andM;After It's LaunchedandM;When the project is completed, which is expected to happen in the nextseveral months, midshipmen will be able to communicate electronically fromtheir dormitory rooms--using Zenith personal computer--across the networkwith the academy's 2,000 faculty and administrators.andP;  &quot;The midshipmen, intheir rooms, can access any [Naval Academy computer] services on campus,&quot;TRW's Marti said.andM;Because the &quot;middies&quot; are required to buy the Zenith PCs, the Navy wantedstudents to get the utmost use from them, Marti said.andP;  Part of the project'sgoal is to &quot;get connectivity from all computing resources on campus,&quot; hesaid.andM;What the academy wants is for every academic department to be able to log into the system with ease and to be able to access the same resources quickly,Smart said.andM;Although Navy officials say implementation is still in the early stages andmuch testing needs to be completed, the Naval Academy hopes to make thenetwork eventually comply with Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) andOpen Systems Interconnect (OSI) standards, Smart said.andM;The Naval Academy started the complex selection task in September 1986, Smartsaid.andP;  &quot;We didn't want to be tied into one hardware and software [system],&quot;she explained.andM;&quot;We asked for the world, and only four [vendors] were interested in giving itto us,&quot; Smart said.andP;  IBM, Contel, Ditel and TRW bid on the project.andM;Although TRW's bid was the lowest, the Navy only gave the cost of the project40 percent weight in deciding who would get the award, Smart said.andO;Technology and project management were given a combined weight of 60 percent.andO;All factors were evaluated by a selection committee.andM;The committee visited each bidder's facility, where the vendor wad requiredto demonstrate how long it took to set up the equipment.andP;  Each vendor wasgiven a week to complete this test.andP;  TRW did it in three days, Smart said.andM;Probably the most attractive competitive feature of TRW's offering, Smartsaid, was its proposed eight-wire, twisted-pair data cable.andP;  The Navyrequired that a six-wire data cable be installed in the buildings and wantedit to last at least 10 years, Smart said.andM;With TRW's proposed eight wires, the Naval Academy would have the flexibilityto expand without having to install new cable.andP;  Smart said the extra twowires would also allow voice capabilities to be added to the network.andM;TRW was awarded the government contract last summer.andM;&quot;What I like about this contract,&quot; Smart said, &quot;is that the vendor isrequired to design it, install it and make it work,&quot; adding that she hadheard of other networking projects in which one vendor does the design butanother does the installation.andM;Part of the TRW's bid included using Q Office, a software package fromQuadratron of Sherman Oaks, Calif., on the academy's distributed networkrunning Unix, Marti said.andM;NADN Provides the ConnectionandM;TRW designed the NADN as the campuswide network to connect all computers atthe academy and thus enable students to access those computers, Smart said.andO;TRW is &quot;required to get them all,&quot; she said.andM;The NADN is designed to enable students to receive bulletin-board andcalendar information on line.andP;  Students can also use other computer servicessuch as word processing, filing and printing, and can submit reports andmathematics problems to professors via electric mail.andM;The NADN will connect numerous Naval Academy computers and networks,including a VAX-11/780 and a VAX 8350 in the chemistry building and computercenter, Smart said.andP;  The academy also has a Gould PowerNode 9050, aSun-3/280, a honeywell DPS 8/62 and Dartmouth Time Sharing Systemsoftware--software that has been difficult to connect to the NADN, Smartsaid.andP;  The academy also has two routerbridges from Wellfleet Communicationsof Bedford, Mass., she said.andM;The network also has a videoteleconferencing capability, with videoconnections throughout the campus.andP;  Plans call for the network to have voicecapabilities as well as video, Smart said.andM;TRW has built into the network the capability for students and faculty toaccess the existing X.25 network, as well as existing IBM PC LAN, 3Com andProteon networks, according to TRW officials.andP;  The network is designed to beup 99 percent of the time, running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Martisaid.andM;TRW has just completed the project's first phase, which called for connecting1,800 rooms in Bancroft Hall--the world's largest dormitory--with the NADNfor access to various host computers.andM;The first phase, which began last September, involved installing the cableplant.andP;  The NADN is built of IEEE 802.3 Ethernet running TCP/IP overfiber-optic cable from Siecor of Hickory, N.C., and broadband coaxial cablefrom other vendors.andM;Approximately 100 miles of fiber-optic equipment was installed in BancroftHall alone, with twisted-pair used as the distribution cable from the wiringcloset to the rooms, according to Joe Wiesenfeld, A TRW systems engineer.andO;The twisted-pair cable averages about 200 feet from the wiring closet to eachof the 4,600 outlets in the dormitory, he said.andM;Also completed in that phase was the renovation of the computer center atWard Hall and the installation of data outlets for the midshipmen and thecomputer center.andM;TRW is using its Advanced Connector Units--which are terminal servers--in theproject, Smart said.andP;  Some ports are RE-232-C and othes are 10Mbit-per-secondports, she said.andM;Smart said she has been particularly impressed with TRW's LAN servers and thespeed with which they reload software.andM;The NADN is being built with twiste-pair concentrators from SynOpticsCommunications of Mountain View, Calif., and network servers from AcerCounterpoints of San Jose, Calif.andM;The academy also has AppleTalk, Smart said.andP;  Marti said TRW has an AppleTalkgateway but has not yet installed it in the NADN.andM;Three gateways from cisco Systems of Menlo Park, Calif., are being used torun from the NADN to existing campus networks, such as the Defense DepartmentNetwork and the academy's X.25 or Packet Wide Area Data Network.andP;  TRWdesigned the network to support DECnet, Wiesenfeld said.andM;In installing the cable, TRW has had to figure ways to avoid damaging thefaces of the buildings, many of which are in the National Historic Register,Wiesenfeld said.andP;  Much of the cable had to run along the same lines asexisting telephone cable, making it a more &quot;circuitous route,&quot; he said.andM;In the second phase of the project, TRW will instal backbone cable on theremaining major buildings, including the installation of data outlets inguardhouses.andP;  Guards will use video capabilities in those facilities,Wiesenfeld said.andM;The Navy currently is doing &quot;acceptance testing&quot; of the first phase of TRW'swork, a standard verification process in a government contract, Marti said.andM;&quot;now the government has to make sure they like it,&quot; he said, adding that aspart of the contract TRW is required to fix any problem that may arise duringthis testing.andM;The Navy contract also calls for TRW to maintain the project for three yearsafter its completion.andP;  That maintenance will cost the Naval Academy anadditional $400,000 as year, Smart said.andM;About 6,000 user outlets or ports are functional now, Marti said.andP;  The planscall for the academy eventually to have a total of 13,000 ports, Smart said.andM;&quot;We're putting them in areas where there are no computers but [where] we willhave them in the future,&quot; she added, explaining that the extra outlets willbe used as the academy's technology capabilities grow.andP;  It is better to havespare ports than to have to pull out wire and reconstruct walls when moreports are needed, Smart said.andM;TRW is currently testing the ports, but the big test is yet to come, Smartsaid.andP;  The academy still must give the midshipmen the required cableconnectors to plug into the outlets or ports.andP;  Once those connections aremade, the academy will be able to see exactly how well TRW's offering willrun.andM;&quot;There is probably no perfect system,&quot; Smart said.andP;  &quot;We see a lot ofcapabilities with the equipment we've received,&quot; she said, adding that theNavy would like everything to be as simple as possible.andP;  For example, theacademy's software needs to be rewritten, she said, so that users don't needto enter so much information when they log in.andP;  Because part of the academyis networked with X.25, the log-in process is slow, she said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
