(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>On October 30, 1990, IBM announced its first real 486-based computer systems:the Model 90 XP 486 and the Model 95 XP 486.andP;  As part of the announcement E3Malso introduced a new graphics architecture: the extended GraphicsandM;Array, or XGAandM;While the XGA doesn't take IBM's standard to the mega-pixel range of the bestworkstation graphics, it represents an important step.andP;  Not only does the XGAoffer important features for Windows, but it consolidates IBM's graphicsofferings and betters the 8514/A on price.andM;THE XGA's ROOTSandM;Until mid-1987, IBM's mass market graphics entries had consisted solely of&quot;dumb&quot; devices.andP;  The &quot;dumb&quot; label applies to graphics controllers that areplain frame buffers with no innate graphics drawing capabilities.andP;  A PCequipped with a dumb frame buffer graphics board must generate all its owndrawing primitives.andP;  Each pixel in a line must be calculated and placed inthe frame buffer &quot;manually&quot; by the computer.andM;As display resolution increases, so does the system overhead in managingthese displays.andP;  Examples of popular dumb frame buffers include CGA, EGA,VGA, and Super VGAandM;IBM released VGA in April 1987, along with its new PS/2 family of productsand the Micro Channel Architecture (MCA).andP;  Significantly, all the newMCA-based PS/2s came with VGA built in.andP;  Prior to this, IBM sold graphicsadapters only as an option.andM;In conjunction with the VGA announcement, IBM unveiled the 8514/A coprocessor(see  An Architectural Overview of the 8514/A&quot;, October '89 MIPS) as anadd-on option to the PS/2.andM;The 8514/A was IBM's first real entry into the PC graphics coprocessormarket.andM;A graphics coprocessor is similar to other types of coprocessors, such as theIntel 8087 family of math coprocessors, in that you provide it with data andcommands and it performs specific functions.andP;  The 8514/A can perform simplegraphics operations, such as drawing fines, filled rectangles, and areafills, but it does little more.andP;  Each of these functions is performed quiterapidly by the specially designed silicon on the 8514/A adapter, therebyoffloading work that the PC might otherwise have to perform.andM;In addition to improved graphics performance, the 8514/A also provides betterresolution than the VGA:s 16-color 640 x 480.andP;  With extra memory, the 8514/Ais capable of 768 lines of 1024 pixels, and each pixel can represent one of256 different colors.andP;  While other niche graphics board companies had alreadyhit a 1024 x 768 resolution, the 8514/A was IBM's first product to achieveit.andM;Now, almost four years later, IBM has taken VGA and the 8514/A, added somegoodies, and combined it all into the XGAandM;THE INNARDS OF XGAandM;The XGA architecture consists primarily of two chips: the display controllerand the graphics coprocessor.andP;  The display controller, as its name implies,controls the output of data to the screen.andP;  The graphics coprocessor performsall graphics drawing functions.andM;The XGA has three mutually exclusive modes of operation: VGA, 132-column textand  native&quot; mode (also known as extended graphics mode).andM;VGA mode is fully compatible with the original IBM VGA and supports allnormal VGA resolutions, but is up to twice as fast with respect to datathroughput.andM;The 132-column text mode is designed to support 3270 emulation on PS/2s, andis akin to similar modes supported by numerous Super EGAs and Super VGAsalready on the market.andM;Extended graphics mode is a new mode that is not compatible with any of IBM'sprevious PS or PS/2 graphics architectures.andP;  It is the only mode in which thegraphics coprocessing capability of the XGA comes into play.andP;  In this mode,the XGA can display resolutions of 640 x 480 or 1024 x 768, in 2, 4, 16, or256 colors.andP;  In 640 x 480 resolution, the XGA is capable of 65,536 colors atonce in a special 16-bit/pixel mode.andP;  This gives XGA almost true colordisplay capabilities, so scanned or captured color images can be displayedwith no noticeable color degradation.andM;In extended graphics mode, the XGA supports graphics primitives similar tothose of the 8514/A, but the implementation is entirely different.andM;The first major difference between the 8514/A and the XGA is that the 8514/Ais entirely I/O mapped.andP;  This means that all communications with the 8514/Amust be performed with I/O instructions, even when they involve reading orwriting to or from 8514/A memory.andP;  I/O instructions are generally slower thanmemory operations, so tasks that require moving large portions of memory, asmight be necessary with a GUI, can be quite time-consuming.andM;The XGA, on the other hand, is primarily memory mapped, which is very handywhen running Windows or other graphical environments.andP;  As an additionalenhancement, the XGA also supports an arbitrary clipping mechanism, whichprevents any portion of the screen from being updated, even down to a singlepixel.andP;  Arbitrary clipping is extremely useful in situations where you haveoverlapping windows with real-time graphics occurring in the underlyingwindows.andP;  Without the special support the XGA provides, each drawn objectwould need to be mathematically checked against multiple boundaries - anenormously time-consuming procedure.andM;Another feature of the XGA is its hardware cursor (also called a &quot;sprite&quot;).andO;The sprite allows a small (up to 64 x 64), two-color image to &quot;float&quot; overthe contents of the XGA frame buffer.andP;  Since the cursor does not actuallyreside as data in the frame buffer, it does not have to be disabled duringdrawing operations that overlap the position of the cursor.andP;  This method,known as cursor exclusion, can increase system performance under GUIs by asmuch as 5 to 20 percent.andM;To further aid complex operating environments, special registers let you saveand restore the state of the XGA, even if it's in the middle of an operation.andM;Perhaps the most interesting feature of XGA, albeit of questionable utility,is bus mastering.andP;  As part of the XGA architecture, any graphics operationcan draw in or extract data from system memory.andP;  Again, this is usefulprimarily for applications running in GUI environments.andP;  However, given thearchitecture of 386- and 486-based systems (the only systems on which the IBMXGA functions), it's of limited value.andP;  (See &quot;Graphics Bus Masters&quot;, January'90 MIPS.)andM;MARKET IMPACT OF THE XGAandM;When I first evaluated the XGA, I didn't think it would have a great impacton the workstation graphics market.andP;  In the ensuing months, however, therehas been a noticeable groundswell of support for the XGA by a number ofgraphics clone companies.andP;  Many of these companies are the ones that havemade Super VGA a household name by improving the original VGA's resolution upto 1024 x 768 with 256 colors, 1280 x 1024 with 16 colors, and even 800 x 600with 32,768 colors.andP;  A number of these companies also have 8514/A clones inthe works, which could potentially ease the development path toward XGAclones.andP;  Integrated Information Technologies (Santa Clara, CA) has even goneso far as to claim it will have an XGA clone available by summer '91.andM;Helping precipitate the growing support for cloning the XGA is IBM's newopenness.andM;The day that the XGA was released, IBM made its detailed technicalspecifications available to anyone who wanted them.andP;  This is in starkcontrast to the company's approach with the 8514/A, for which it has providedonly a software in face known as the Al (Adapter Interface).andM;Also contributing to the XGA's acceptance was IBM's participation in theComdex/Fall'90 meeting of VESA  Video Electronics Standards Association) aScant two weeks after the XGA's introduction.andP;  At the meeting, IBM presentedits view of the XGA and how it fits into the grand scheme of things.andP;  Thecompany declared that it wanted to make the XGA the next graphics industrystandard, and would help in any reasonable way it could to ensure this wouldhappen.andP;  Since VESA represents virtually all the major players in both theSuper VGA and monitor markets, IBM's presentation likely had a definiteimpact on the industry.andM;IBM's approach to providing XGA support to its end users is remarkable inseveral ways.andP;  First, the XGA marks the first time a major computer companyhas provided a graphics coprocessor with high-performance graphics andresolution as a default solution.andP;  Second, the XGA (priced at $1095 as aseparate add-on board) is less expensive than 8514/A (which costsapproximately $1400) and other high-end graphics devices, so it's verycompetitive in the marketplace.andP;  Third, by supporting the XGA only on 386-and486-based systems, IBM increases XGA's prestige as a low-cost, high-endgraphics adapter.andM;And IBM has accomplished another first: providing several drivers for the XGAEvery XGA coprocessor that IBM ships comes with drivers for MicrosoftWindows, AutoCAD, OS/2 Presentation Manager, and 8514/A Al.andP;  By providingthese drivers as well as VGA compatibility, the XGA supports virtually all PCgraphics software in some form, often at high resolutions.andP;  This is the firsttime IBM has shipped drivers for key applications with its graphics products.andM;The implication is that software compatability with graphics hardware isbecoming increasingly important, while hardware or register levelcompatibility is perhaps becoming less so.andM;CLONING COMPLICATIONSandM;Nonetheless, hardware compatibility remains a very real requirement.andP;  Eventhough the will is there, there will be some complications for companieswanting to clone the XGAandM;The first complication is that the XGA, as mentioned earlier, consists of twochips.andP;  While the graphics coprocessor isn't a tremendous problem forcloners, the display controller is a different matter.andP;  The displaycontroller consists of four elements: the VRAM serializer, which extractsgraphics data for display from the frame buffer, the hardware cursor; thedisplay signal generator, which sets up the proper display signals for thecurrent resolution; and the RAM DAC, which translates the digital pixel valueinto the analog signal displayed by the monitor.andM;Bus mastering is another problem, because it's virtually impossible tosupport reliable bus mastering in ISA-based machines.andP;  ISA machines make upthe vast majority of PCs currently in use.andP;  Bus mastering is possible in EISAsystems, but EISA systems have traditionally comprised a small percentage ofthe market.andM;The XGA's support of 386 and 486 systems exclusively is really only asoftware limitation.andP;  XGA initialization software has embedded 386-specificcommands and therefore can't run on 286-based systems.andP;  While there is noreason that XGA clones can't be made to work in 286s, the 386/486 orientationof the XGA reflects the market's trend toward more powerful 32-bit systems.andO;In fact, it's likely that many software developers who write XGA-specificcode may design their code to work only in 386-based and higher systems,thereby limiting the potential usefulness of any 286-based XGA clones.andM;But even if the bus master issue is resolved, there's still the matter ofmaking sure that software developers write XGA-specific software that willwork on all types of PCs - MCA, ISA, or EISAandM;The difficulty here is that the XGA specification currently entails someprogramming operations that are specific to the MCA bus.andM;All these problems might make the future of XGA clones look bleak.andP;  But in asurprising show of unity, a number of the key players in the graphics clonemarket have formed the new VESA XGA Committee to discuss possible solutions.andM;By working under VESA, these companies hope to set standards that will makeit easier to develop XGA-compatible hardware and software.andM;WHAT'S IN THE FUTURE?andM;The XGA holds the potential of being the next industry standard after VGA.andO;With its higher resolution and higher performance, it's a good choice forusers who want to speed up their Windows and CAD applications.andP;  Important tothe success of the XGA, however, is how widespread the technology ultimatelybecomes.andM;So with that in mind, I'll revisit the XGA and its clones later this year tosee how the clone companies have come along th their efforts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
