Holds Talks on Possible Sale Of 3 Principal Lines </HL><SO> </SO><CO> COO </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> PALO ALTO, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cooper Cos. said it received &quot;indications of interest&quot; from independent parties about buying each of three principal businesses of the company.    The company said it and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. are talking with certain of the parties about the sale of the company's optometric, ophthalmic surgical and diagnostic businesses. Cooper said it hopes to propose specific transactions to a committee of its directors within 30 days.    The debt-laden marketer of medical devices and diagnostics, which has previously shown a tendency to sell and recombine pieces of itself, said it believes it has enough cash to sustain itself until it sells one of the businesses.    However, Cooper also said it expects to complete arrangements for $40 million of interim financing in the next few weeks. Last month, Schering-Plough Corp., a Madison, N.J., drug company, dropped out of a $195 million accord to buy some of Cooper's vision-care businesses. </TEXT></DOC>
