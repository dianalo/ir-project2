Teen-agers snap upPhiladelphia Phillies jerseys, though many have never heardof the team. Outmoded U.S. brands such as Pinky andamp; Diannebecome a fad among secretaries. Many Japanese dress up evenon weekends, shopping at department stores in suits anddresses. But in the summer, Japanese bankers and brokersthink nothing of working in short-sleeved dress shirts.   Figuring out local preferences may well be worthwhile.Young Japanese in particular are increasingly seeking foreignbrands, influenced by detailed articles on them in suchfashion magazines as &quot;Fineboys.&quot; As Japan's huge apparelmarket -- in which designer brands alone account for annualsales of two trillion yen ($13 billion) -- welcomes more U.S.names, American companies face a growing opportunity.   One key to successful marketing in Japan is to emblazonproducts with a name. Logos, slapped onto anything fromumbrellas to socks to toilet seat covers, can never be tooobvious. Michiko Koshino, a London-based Japanese casual weardesigner, says one of the best-selling items in her business,which has annual sales of three billion yen, is a winterjacket whose entire back is covered with her logo, MichikoLondon Koshino, in thick capital letters. The names don'teven have to make sense: Other popular Japanese logos includePosh Boy, Papas and Pink House.   Many Japanese have a tremendous fondness for Americana,which offers companies easy promotional strategies. LeviStrauss andamp; Co.'s Japanese subsidiary saw its sales soar afterlaunching an advertising campaign 12 years ago that claimedJames Dean, Marilyn Monroe and John Wayne all wore Levi'sjeans. In 1978, only 6% of Japanese identified Levi's as apreferred brand in surveys, but the figure shot up to 51%last year, the company says.   Of course, appealing to the Japanese also requires somesubtle tactics. Consumers crowd the streets dressed insurprisingly similar clothes, and yet many like to feelthey're picking out something exclusive. Japanese retailerssay they address this problem by displaying only a few itemsat a time in the same size and color, though more are instock.   Quality is one area in which, in the eyes of Japaneseconsumers, many U.S. companies still could stand to improve.An official at a Japanese apparel maker says he recentlyrejected a high-priced American T-shirt because he found thatthe seams had little stitching holes when he stretched theshirt. Japanese consumers &quot;expect high-quality items toinclude hidden effort, even in areas that don't show,&quot; saysthe official, who asked not to be identified. &quot;Whether that'sreally necessary is a different matter.&quot;   But sometimes, American retailers can attract consumers bybeing just plain American, according to retail conglomerateAeon Group. The company, which a few years ago bought TalbotsInc., a Hingham, Mass., women's clothing retailer, made itsTokyo store look exactly like its U.S. stores. It importsconservative linen dresses in colors so bright that mostTokyo retailers would immediately tone them down. But thestore's sales are strong enough that the 200 million yensales projection for this year may have to be upgraded, saysMotoya Okada, president of Talbots's Japanese operation.&quot;We're selling more than we thought,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
