Moreover, a pick contact-activated system of water releaseto the nozzles was designed. Initial field trials have been carried out.At present, the water spray valves are being improved. For the watersupply of a double-ranging drum shearer loader a pressure gauge pumpwas succesfully tested during several months of field trials. On thetest rig a Venturi channel of the dust extraction system for installationin a shearer drum was on a trial. This system is intended to extractdust-loaded air from the drum clearance ring zone. At the same time thejet water creating the negative pressure is used for dust precipitation.</TEXT></DOC>
