The $10-a-share plan was disclosed last August, when Arnox shares were trading around $7. Since then, shares of Arnox, a fire-retardant chemical maker, have plunged. They were quoted Friday at $4 bid in over-the-counter trading.    Arnox blamed the ruptured deal on &quot;continued uncertainty&quot; following last October's stock-market crash. TXL is a San Francisco financial-services company. </TEXT></DOC>
