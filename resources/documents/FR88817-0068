Box 60267,New Orleans, Louisiana 70160-0267.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>.<ITAG tagnum="84">1. Authority</ITAG>This effort is being conducted as an interim study under the ``Mermentau,Vermilion, and Calcasieu Rivers and Bayou Teche, Louisiana,'' study. Approvalfor the interim study was granted by the Corps of Engineers, Lower MississippiValley Division, by letter dated 9 August 1983.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Proposed Action</ITAG>The proposed action consists of recommending a plan to increase the watersupply to lower Bayou Teche and the Vermilion River. The plan will considerthe alternatives described below. The Teche-Vermilion Basins water supplyproject, completed in 1982, supplements low flows in Bayou Teche and theVermilion River with water pumped from the Atchafalaya River. Since projectcompletion, full pumping capacity has not been attained due to inadequateflow capacity of Upper Bayou Teche. Inadequate fresh water supplies contributeto saltwater intrusion in the lower parts of the basin. Saltwater intrustionin the agricultural water supply results in reduced yields to rice andcrawfish farmers. Over 10,000 acres of rice and 12,000 acres of crawfishfarms are affected by lack of fresh water.<ITAG tagnum="84">3. Alternatives</ITAG>The alternatives being considered are: (a) Channel improvements to BayouTeche from Port Barre to Arnaudville, (b) channel improvements for WestAtchafalaya Basin Protection Levee borrow pit and new channel cut, (c),a change in operating procedures for the Bayou Courtableau Drainage Structure,(d) No-action plan, which would involve a status-quo scenario whereby therebe no change in Federally mandated operating procedures or Federal constructionactivities.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Scoping Process</ITAG>a. Public input for scoping will be achieved through the distribution ofa widely circulated Scoping Input Request to all segments of the publichaving an interest in the project. In addition, a news release will beissued to the local media. The notice and release will request submissionof views on alternatives, significant resources in the study area, andany other project-related issue considered important.b. A tentative list of significant issues to be discussed in the EIS includes:Agriculture, business and industrial activity, displacement of people andfarms, employment, tax revenues, property values, public facilities andservices, noise, housing, community cohesion, community facilities, endangeredspecies, wildlife resources, fishery resources, forest resources, wildliferefuges and management areas, National Register sites, and other culturaland historical resources.c. The U.S. Department of the Interior will provide a Fish and WildlifeCoordination Act Report to accompany the EIS. Coordination will be maintainedwith the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on endangered species, and theLouisiana Department of Natural Resources will be consulted regarding consistencywith the Coastal Zone Management Act. Coordination will be maintained withthe State Historic Preservation Officer.d. A 60-day public review period will be allowed so that all interestedagencies and individuals have the opportunity to comment on the draft reportand EIS.<ITAG tagnum="84">5. Meeting Schedule</ITAG>Public meetings for the specific purpose of scoping are not being considered.Comments received as a result of the Scoping Input Request will be compiledand analyzed, and Scoping Document summarizing the results will be madeavailable to all respondents.<ITAG tagnum="84">6. Availability</ITAG>The draft report and EIS are scheduled to be available to the public inJuly 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: August 2, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lloyd K.
