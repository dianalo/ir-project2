Salwen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR NDX CMD </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The New York Stock Exchange, in an effort to limit stock-price volatility, voted to curb member firms' use of its computerized order-execution system for a form of program trading.    The 27-member board, as expected, approved a rule that prohibits member firms from using the &quot;SuperDot&quot; system for index arbitrage if the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved 50 points from the prior day's close.    The move, which will be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval, strengthens a Big Board voluntary request passed Jan. 14. Under that plan, member firms were asked not to use the SuperDot system for program trades after the industrial average moved more than 75 points.    But the Big Board never had a chance to test that proposal because the Dow Jones industrials haven't moved that much in one day during that time. The exchange said that the industrial average has moved more than 50 points in a day 26 times since Jan. 1, 1986.    The exchange said that pending SEC approval of the new rule, it will continue its voluntary curbs but tighten the limit to 50 points. The restriction would remain in effect for the rest of the trading day once it was triggered.    Program trading involves rapid buying or selling of big baskets of stocks; in index arbitrage, such transactions are offset by trades in the stock-index futures market.    The Big Board has been under intense pressure from member firms to limit stock-price volatility, which has been blamed for driving individual investors from the market and creating a difficult equity-trading environment.    One Wall Street trader immediately criticized the new proposal, contending that it will creat havoc on the exchange floor. &quot;The guys sitting in the trading rooms just bark out an order. Instead of moving the instructions to a computer, it spews out a whole bunch of pre-printed tickets,&quot; he explained. &quot;Then they have floor people pick them up and run around&quot; to the trading areas to complete the transactions.    &quot;I doubt this is going to inhibit activity,&quot; he added. &quot;Look at the guys who are doing this. Money's money.&quot;    But Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, which oversees the SEC, in a statement called the Big Board's move &quot;a reasonable step&quot; and said he is &quot;glad to see that the markets are moving to restore investor confidence.&quot;    Jeff Miller, managing partner of Miller Tabak Hirsch andamp; Co., an investment banking and brokerage firm that does index arbitrage for customers, said the rule &quot;creates opportunities for the real arbitragers. This is like a Christmas present for someone like us.&quot;    He said the rule will help the biggest brokerages carry out index arbitrage. &quot;It really does help the very big firms on the floor who don't need the machines,&quot; he said.    Still, he said, he understands the pressure on the Big Board to enact such a rule. &quot;I kind of believe that in the short run an action that will be perceived as helping the market -- and I'm talking perceived now -- is a useful thing to do.&quot;    Moreover, he added, &quot;in the long run it's breaking the link between the futures market and the cash market. The futures product can't go anywhere if it doesn't have a solid link to the cash market&quot; for stocks. </TEXT></DOC>
