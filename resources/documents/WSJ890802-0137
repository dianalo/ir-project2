At the same time, if anyone trespasses our rights, we'll go ahead,&quot; she said. &quot;It isn't that we support it, but it is a means of defending ourselves.&quot;    The conversation took place in a Tehran hotel room two weeks ago, before the current crisis over the Israeli abduction of Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem cleric and pro-Iran leader in Lebanon, and the apparent killing of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. The group that claimed to have killed Col. Higgins is believed by U.S. intelligence agencies to be a faction of Hezbollah, a pro-Iran Shiite group.    Both Iran's president-elect, Hashemi Rafsanjani, and hardline Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi have said recently that Iran isn't in control of the hostage takers. But in conversation with the women of Hezbollah visiting Tehran, a rather different picture emerged.    &quot;We are followers of Velayat-e-faqih -- Islamic orders,&quot; explained one of the women, an editorial writer for an Islamic magazine. &quot;Whatever the leader says, we are to follow.&quot; The delegation of about half a dozen Hezbollah members was in Tehran to take part in a conference on the life and works of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.    The woman said her particular group didn't hold any captives. &quot;But Hezbollah isn't just one group -- anyone who follows God and the Koran is Hezbollah,&quot; she said.    At the conference, a Hezbollah delegate delivered several passionate speeches about the late Ayatollah Khomeini. &quot;Now we divide our lives into two parts: before and after his death,&quot; she said. &quot;The people of Lebanon haven't stopped weeping at their loss.&quot;    Like the other Hezbollah delegates, she wore the severest of Islamic dress, her black chador, or shawl, pulled tight over a cowelled hood and long tunic. But in the privacy of her hotel room, she was barely recognizable in a sheer silk shift, her blonde-streaked hair flowing free to her waist. The editorial writer, meanwhile, lounged on the bed in a pink satin negligee with a deep-plunge neckline.    The conversation began with a 45-minute dissertation on &quot;the oppressions designed by the superpowers&quot; to torment Lebanese Moslems. &quot;You have to remember that the U.S. ship New Jersey destroyed half of Lebanon, and the cluster bombs of the Israelis were made in the U.S.A.,&quot; she said. She also pointed out that the late Lebanese leader, the Maronite Christian Bashir Gemayel, allegedly was an asset of the Central Intelligence Agency.    &quot;It shows how these three, Israel, the Maronites and America, were hand in hand,&quot; she says. &quot;So it's only natural for the Moslem nation to start a struggle against them.&quot;    Nevertheless, the women were anxious about their demonic image in the West. &quot;Please convey our greetings to the American people,&quot; she said. &quot;We aren't against them, only their government. When you come to Lebanon, I promise Hezbollah is the group you will like best of all,&quot; she said with a grin.    The same week, the husbands of some of the women also were in Tehran, participating in Iranian-sponsored negotiations to end the bloody feud between Hezbollah and the somewhat more moderate Lebanese Shiite organization, Amal.    During Ayatollah Khomeini's lifetime, Iran built up and backed Hezbollah at the expense of Amal, largely because, as an established militia and political party, Amal wouldn't blindly follow Tehran's dictates.    The reconciliation, which was successful, is a possible signal of the newly pragmatic tone of Iranian foreign policy in the post-Khomeini era. According to one well-informed Iranian analyst, some key Iranian politicians have long seen the hostage impasse as an embarrassment -- a blunder that discredited the Islamic revolution without reaping any major political gain. But the current crisis is likely to hamper any moderation. </TEXT></DOC>
