 Dimensions Presenter from Visual Information Development Inc.andO;focuses on rendering and 3-D animation and doesn't provide modeling tools.andO;Strata Inc.'s StrataVision 3d doesn't do animation but includes a 3-D modelerwith very sophisticated rendering.andP;  Zing from Enabling Technologies Inc. isan attempt to apply modeling tools to the traditionally 2-D realm ofmiscellaneous illustration.andM;These programs herald the maturing of desktop 3-D, which will give designersaccess to a range of modeling and visualization tools previously hidden awayin high-end CAD and animation shops.andP;  And the Macintosh trimmings makephoto-realistic rendering and 3-D animation more accessible than ever before.andM;This new breed doesn't pretend to have CAD aspirations.andP;  They have minimaldimensioning features and are aimed primarily toward graphic (mouse-and-eye)indication of sizes and locations.andP;  By virtue of more flexible, intuitivemodeling capabilities, some of this new software will be useful earlier inthe design process than is most 3-D CAD software.andP;  Another group of theseprograms complements more mundane modeling tools by applying photo-realisticimaging or animation to already-existing models.andP;  This capability will beuseful for building complex animations such as product presentations andarchitectural walk-throughs.andP;  Automatically filling in between the explicitframes of an animation by means of interpolating view locations, objectpositions and so on, otherwise known as 3-D tweening, is a huge labor saver.andM;Ideally, these different pieces of a total 3-D capability could be strungtogether as seamlessly as Claris CAD details paste into Word memos.andO;Unfortunately, in the absence of stronger industry standards, model transfersremain complex and often difficult.andM;The modeling process.andP;  Making a physical model of a new design can start in acouple of ways.andP;  You may first draw flat, usually orthographic views of anobject, and then use these to guide the cutting out and assembly of modelmaterial.andP;  Alternatively, you may go directly to working in three dimensions,using clay, foam or cardboard to rough out objects in space.andP;  This approachhas the advantage that the greater realism of the spatial model can informthe entire design process.andM;Similarly, a 3-D computer model can be built directly in the virtual space ofthe modeling software or objects can first be drawn in 2-D views or inseparate 2-D applications.andP;  Objects can either be built up from simplegeometric shapes (referred to as &quot;primitives&quot;) or extruded, revolved orskinned together from more complex user-drawn profiles.andM;Most Macintosh modelers have a classical four-views interface to the modelspace, the drawing in each view comprising a flat window onto the designworld.andP;  One basic problem with this approach is that standard Macintoshmonitors aren't big enough for all these windows.andP;  Also, except on thefastest machines, scrolling a complex model can be slow, and redrawing fourviews only multiplies the problem.andM;StrataVision 3d.andP;  While StrataVision 3d provides more modeling tools thanZing or Presenter, its strength lies in sophisticated rendering.andP;  It has awide range of smoothed rendering, anti-aliasing and graphic-mappingcapabilities, including ray tracing and pattern mapping.andP;  Animationcapabilities are available in the separate StrataFlight program.andM;StrataVision 3d's modeling features are typical of four-view-typeapplications.andP;  Extruding and revolving (through a full 360 degrees only) arethe main ways to build shapes other than cube, sphere, cylinder, and coneprimitives.andP;  Objects can be grouped, ungrouped and locked in place.andP;  Moving,rotating and scaling are controlled graphically, as is the depth of theextrude operation.andP;  Objects have a center point that can be relocated andused as a pivot for rotating and other operations.andP;  Additional features forprecision modeling would be helpful.andM;StrataVision 3d can import models and supporting material in several formats,including PICT, Encapsulated PostScript, Super 3D, MiniCAD, DXF (DrawingInterchange Format) and IGES (Initial Graphic Exchange Specification).andP;  Thisflexibility makes StrataVision 3d a useful tool for presentation work, inconjunction with production-oriented mainframe and mini-computer CAD systems.andM;Rendering is StrataVision 3d's specialty.andP;  It matches Dimensions Presenterwith its two-, eight- or 24-bit or gray-scale image calculations, includingsmooth shading and anti-aliasing.andP;  But it goes beyond this level withpowerful pattern- and texture-mapping features.andP;  Extra-cost libraries ofpatterns for specific materials insulate the user from much of the technicalcomplexity of generating and applying the realistic patterns.andM;StrataVision 3d's ray-tracing capability allows precise calculation oftransparencies and object inter-reflections.andP;  For instance, looking at a wineglass through a camera lens, you can render both the view through the glassand the faint reflection of the camera in the glass.andM;StrataVision 3d also provides a full range of white and colored light sources-- point, spot and global/directional.andP;  The attributes of lights includeimages, so a light can project an image, such as a slide projector within ascene.andP;  Placement and direction of lights is entirely graphical, a nicecapability but one that makes it difficult for the user to make accuratesun-angle projections.andM;StrataVision 3d's weaker points include less-than-lucid icons and a slowscroll bar for adjusting the angle of view of a scene.andP;  A compensating pointis that images can be calculated in Unattended mode using a batch capabilityand saved in PICT and TIFF formats.andM;But in general, StrataVision 3d looks and feels like a professional program,with a relatively well-thought-out interface that's easy to work with.andM;Dimensions Presenter.andP;  Visual Information Development's Dimensions Presenteris a significant addition to the company's line of 3-D products, withmidrange rendering capabilities, fly-through animation and animation-playbackfunctions.andP;  Dimensions Presenter users are expected to do primary modelingwork in other programs and then bring the model geometry into Presenter forrendering and animation.andP;  Other products from Visual Information providesurface modeling and basic shading capabilities (Design Dimensions),additional modeling capabilities (Solid Dimensions), and high-quality staticimaging for Dimensions models (Ray-Trace Dimensions).andP;  Unfortunately, each ofthese expensive modules must be purchased separately.andP;  Even the translatorsrequired to bring non-Dimensions models into Presenter are separate,extra-cost modules.andM;If you make this large investment, you get strong but unpolished tools nearthe forefront of Macintosh 3-D software.andP;  Once a model is in the DimensionsPresenter environment, previewing, calculating and then runningcolor-rendered animations of 3-D scenes is relatively easy.andP;  The program'sforte seems to be the integration of graphical-view setup controls withanimation previewing, which allows the user to step through a sequence oneview at a time, interactively tuning the progression of frames.andM;Views in Dimensions Presenter are defined primarily with 3-Deye-point-to-look-point vectors that can be displayed in orthographic viewsand adjusted by dragging.andP;  By selecting all view vectors simultaneously, thepath through a sequence can be displayed and adjusted.andP;  This all-graphic,vector-by-vector approach is useful for roughing out a sequence.andP;  As asequence gets larger and more refined, needing more controlled adjustments, ahigher-level mechanism for path control would be helpful.andM;Dimensions Presenter has no model-making capabilities.andP;  It does havescene-assembly tools that allow placement of predefined objects.andP;  Theseobjects can be from Design Dimensions or in 3-D PICT format.andP;  Separatetranslators allow models in Super 3D, Versa-CAD or AutoCAD (DXF) formats tobe read in.andP;  Models from any of these sources are reconstructed as polygonalsurfaces with exactly three or four sides.andP;  In some cases, manual subdivisionof more complex polygons is necessary.andM;Dimensions Presenter's rendering capabilities are good but not the best.andO;Polygonal models can be rendered in two-, eight-, or 24-bit color modes, withsmoothing of facets and anti-aliasing of edges to avoid jaggies.andP;  Inanimation mode, an adjustable number of in-between frames can be calculatedautomatically.andP;  According to Visual Information, when the optional Ray-TraceDimensions module is present, the appropriate additional options forray-tracing are automatically added to Dimensions Presenter's menus anddialog boxes.andM;Dimensions Presenter has a variety of rough edges that make it aless-than-satisfying tool.andP;  They include a graphically busy and confusingmanual, pointlessly non-standard command names, and a failure to offer tosave changes when closing a file.andP;  At least one active menu option calls anunimplemented function.andP;  Menus, dialogs and palettes are used inconsistently,and the icon graphics are unclear and unattractive.andM;Dimensions Presenter does not attempt to be a total solution for 3-Dgraphics.andP;  It supplies good rendering functions and walk-through-typeanimation capabilities, with basic animation playback as well.andP;  However, thesometimes clunky and generally uneven interface, together with the high costof putting together a complete set of Dimensions modules, leaves considerableroom for competition.andM;Zing.andP;  Zing is the simplest of the three programs reviewed here.andP;  For a lowprice, it supplies elementary modeling and viewing tools as well as basicflat shading in the rendering area.andP;  Enabling Technologies has taken aninteresting approach to marketing Zing, aiming it at non-artists rather thangraphics specialists.andP;  Unfortunately, the capabilities of the program are notwell-presented, showing their MS-DOS connection both on-screen and in thecombination Mac/DOS manuals.andP;  Although Zing provides some unique features,the sum is disappointing.andM;Modeling in Zing centers on the fundamental extrude and revolve operations,called Profiler and Lathe, which create 3-D forms from 2-D outlines.andP;  Theseoperations are performed in specialized tool windows, and only outlines madefrom straight line segments can be used.andP;  Cubes, wedges and spheres also canbe created directly.andP;  The Merge function performs the basic volumetricBoolean operations of union, subtraction and intersection as well as aspecial operation called Emboss that stamps a flat image of the tool objectonto the receiving object.andP;  Boolean operations are considered to be ahallmark of solid-modeling applications and are absent from most desktopmodeling programs.andM;Zing objects can be moved, rotated, aligned and scaled.andP;  There is also aspecial function for tweaking text, useful for building 3-D logos.andP;  Renderingoptions include flat shading, hidden-line drawing and points-only drawingshowing just the vertices of an object's surface polygons.andP;  The PolygonShading option allows the user to apply differing colors to individual bandsof polygons around or along an object.andP;  Gloss can be applied to an object ora specific polygon.andP;  Both perspective and isometric views are possible,although the process for setting up or adjusting a view is somewhatcumbersome.andP;  Up to eight light sources are possible, with adjustable cones.andM;This list of capabilities would put Zing in the middle range of availablemodelers, making it a good value.andP;  But there is a seamy underside to thisprogram, typical of a bad port from the MS-DOS environment.andP;  The MS-DOSconnection shows up in confusing and unattractive window layouts andnon-standard meanings for various icons.andP;  For example, an icon of a pencil,which commonly indicates a freehand drawing tool in the Mac environment, isused to trigger a screen redraw.andM;Other telltale flaws and omissions include no standard Cut and Pastecommands, the lack of a Page Setup menu option, no object grouping orungrouping functions (although objects that do not intersect can still bemerged), and a strange method for drawing arcs.andP;  Resizing an object requiresusing a menu command rather than dragging the object's handles in classic Macfashion.andM;Zing is compatible with the Clip3D libraries, also sold by EnablingTechnologies.andP;  Access to these extensive collections of 3-D clip-art objectsmight justify buying a $200 program.andP;  Unfortunately, most of the libraryobjects are crude extrusions of one or a few simple outlines, with a cheapgraphics look.andP;  They are too rudimentary and unattractive to be of much useto a graphics professional, and the non-professional would probably getbetter results for less effort using standard-quality 2-D clip art.andP;  Theconcept of making stock art more flexible by supplying it in model formremains intriguing, but the novel approach does not make up for the weakeffort.andM;Super 3D and Swivel 3D.andP;  Super 3D and Swivel 3D, both recently upgraded (seeMacWEEK, Sept.andP;  9, 1989), are seasoned survivors that deserve considerationin any look at Macintosh 3-D modeling and CAD.andM;Super 3D from Silicon Beach Software Inc. has grown considerably during itsseveral years on the market.andP;  As an early entry, its file format has becomesomething of a standard.andP;  In fact, the Super 3D format is currently importedby more Mac 3-D applications than any other.andP;  Super 3D can be used withfamiliar drawing programs by taking in draw-type PICTs as construction linesto be extruded or revolved.andP;  It uses an odd, pre-32-bit QuickDraw colorsystem, producing images in up to 16,000 colors or 64 grays.andP;  It supportsnovel applications with a simple text format for input and output of 3-Dgeometry and can generate image sequences in the PICS format for animation.andO;With its four-view approach to modeling, Super 3D rates as a solid performer,aimed perhaps too generally and spread a little thin.andM;For many uses, Paracomp Inc.'s Swivel 3D remains the favorite general-purpose3-D modeler.andP;  Swivel covers about the same territory as Super 3D, but itbenefits from a stronger underlying concept, based on object trees witheasily defined, intelligent joints.andP;  This modeling approach is unusual buteffective and workable.andP;  The joints and hierarchy facilitate animation andstatic posing of articulated objects and even simplify design adjustments.andM;Swivel provides very good rendering functions, with smoothing, anti-aliasing,shadow casting, object-by-object pattern maps, and tweening of object andview movements, with batch calculation of sequences with PICS output.andO;However, the program provides only basic light sources and only takes in PICTfiles as bit-maps for tracing.andP;  There is a user-accessible command languagebehind Swivel, but it is not emphasized.andM;Conclusions.andP;  StrataVision 3d, Dimensions Presenter and Zing are members of anew class of applications, somewhat like 3-D CAD tools but with apreponderance of illustration- or graphics-oriented characteristics.andP;  Theyare easier to use, so they can be controlled by artists rather thantechnicians.andP;  These presentation tools may provide a bridge between theprecision CAD design processes of today and the free-wheeling,multidimensional, multimedia processes of tomorrow.andM;While there are a number of clear themes common to these applications, somethings are still missing across the board.andP;  To reach 3-D bliss, we still needbetter interfaces for modeling, geometry exchange standards to the level of3-D cut and paste, and fundamental parametric and solid modeling-orientedsoftware kernels.andM;We reviewed three 3-D rendering and animation tools for visualization:StrataVision 3d, Dimensions Presenter and Zing.andP;  The programs differ widelyin their scope and capabilities, but taken together represent a significantadvance toward the goal of desktop 3-D animation.andM;Dimensions Presenter from Visual Information Development, and Strata'sStrataVision 3d cover much of the same territory in rendering and animation.andO;But Presenter's rendering tools are not as smooth or sophisticated asStrataVision's, and ray tracing costs extra, whereas it's included inStrataVision 3d.andP;  Interpreter, the translations module that supportsPresenter, costs extra too, while StrataVision includes most translators.andO;Presenter's 3-D view vectors work well for animation path definition, and theframe-previewing system is helpful.andP;  It would be useful to have somescripting, and the poorly presented manual and clumsy interface graphicsreally detract from the technically solid software.andP;  Overall, while notvisually pleasing, Presenter is a very functional entry-level program for 3-Danimation.andM;For what it tries to do, StrataVision 3d has the best combination ofaccessibility and sophistication.andP;  It includes a decent modeler but sings asa rendering application, making complex scenes relatively easy to compose.andO;StrataVision would benefit from cleanup of some distracting details, andneeds to (gracefully) provide for direct numerical control of certain tools.andO;Sequential batch calculating would make it a truly powerful image generatorfor heavy-duty 3-D-based multimedia work.andM;Enabling Technologies' Zing has some nice touches but is a poorly adaptedport from the IBM world with many inconsistencies.andP;  It provides only the mostbasic modeling and rendering capabilities, and the 3-D clip-art librariesthat might otherwise justify its purchase are terrible.andM;A discussion of 3-D modelers is not complete without mentioning Paracomp'sSwivel 3D and Silicon Beach Software's Super 3D, two well-established entriesreviewed earlier (see MacWEEK, Sept.andP;  9, 1989).andP;  Swivel 3D's recent upgradeprovides some CAD application-type features (attributes, rulers) and despitesome continuing weaknesses still stands as a unique and effective modelingtool with very good rendering and enough animation to be useful.andP;  The newapplications compared here show how much power Swivel gives you for arelatively low cost.andP;  And since the new applications read in Super 3D models,they help Super 3D remain an interesting option.andP;  Super 3D's import ofdraw-type PICTs allows a more direct approach to building models based onexisting drawings.andM;Enabling Technologies Inc.andM;Zing: $199.95andM;600 S.
