The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil MarketReport that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countrieslifted about 22.3 million barrels of crude a day in September, thesame as in August.   ``Most of the higher output in August and September was from the(Persian) Gulf countries, although production in Iran and Iraq fellslightly in September,'' said the report by the Paris-based agency.   Ian Graham, an analyst at County NatWest in London, predictedthe cartel's production would pick up a bit more in October, likelyto about 22.5 million barrels a day.   Some countries, he said, will widen their taps to meet thehigher output quotas set last week by OPEC ministers meeting inGeneva.   During their talks, the officials decided to boost their overallproduction ceiling from 19.5 million barrels a day to 20.5 millionbarrels in the last three months of the year.   The increase of 1 million barrels in the ceiling was dividedproportionately among all 13 member countries, giving each a littlemore than under the current accord.   Led by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, the cartel has beenproducing well above its supply cap in recent months.   Despite the flood of oil, prices have remained steady in recentmonths, reflecting strong consumer demand for the commodity.   However, prices remain under OPEC's target of $18 a barrel. Theaverage price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC was$16.82 a barrel in the last week of September.   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American brand, hastopped the $20-a-barrel mark in recent days. Middle Eastern brandsrun about $3 a barrel less.   The energy agency estimated total consumption of oil, excludingcentrally planned economies, at 52.1 million barrels a day in 1989,rising to 53.8 million barrels in the first quarter of next year.Demand for OPEC oil was estimated at 22.2 million barrels in theJanuary-March period of 1990.   Graham said Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates might trim theiroutput some in coming months to reflect ``a little morediscipline'' after the Geneva meeting.   The two Gulf countries have been overproducing to draw attentionto their demands for higher shares of OPEC's total production.   The ministers were scheduled to meet in late November in Vienna,Austria, to map their strategy for the first half of 1990. Theywere also expected to take up the sensitive issue of reallocatingoutput shares.   The energy agency's report estimated the United Arab Emirates'supplied 2.2 million barrels a day in September, double its quotaof about a million barrels. Kuwait's production was put at 1.7million barrels a day, compared with its cap of a million barrels.   Nigeria produced about 1.8 million barrels a day last month, upfrom its quota of 1.4 million barrels a day, according to thereport.   Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 1 crude exporter, pumped anestimated 5 million barrels a day, above its target of 4.8 millionbarrels.   Iran and Iraq each lifted about 2.8 million barrels a day, thesame as their quotas.   Other production estimates for September were: Qatar, 400,000barrels a day; Libya, 1.1 million barrels; Algeria, 700,000barrels; Gabon, 200,000 barrels; Venezuela, 1.7 million barrels;Ecuador, 300,000 barrels; and Indonesia, 1.2 million barrels.   The energy agency is an arm of the Organization of EconomicCooperation and Development, made up of two-dozen industrializednations.</TEXT></DOC>
