Law Firm To Open Moscow Office </HL><SO> </SO><IN> FIN </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Coudert Brothers, a law firm based here, said it will open a Moscow office early next month to serve its clients' interests in the Soviet Union.    Coudert will be the first foreign law firm to establish operations in Moscow, James B. Sitrick, chairman of the firm's executive committee, said. The firm, which has 17 offices in 11 countries, said the Moscow office will be headed by Coudert lawyer Richard N. Dean.    &quot;Many of our clients, both U.S. and other international companies, have already announced plans for joint ventures, trading and commercial relationships in the U.S.S.R., and others are actively considering business projects there,&quot; Mr. Sitrick said.    Two Coudert clients, Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp., and Montedison S.p.A. of Italy, signed an agreement in November with the Soviet Union to build and operate a petrochemical production plant near the Caspian Sea. The project requires an investment of $5 billion to $6 billion, with the two companies providing most of that amount. Mr. Sitrick said other clients that may have an interest in activities in the U.S.S.R. include Fiat S.p.A. of Italy and Mannesmann AG of West Germany.    Mr. Dean, 33 years old, speaks and writes Russian and has been with Coudert since 1980. He served in New York for five years, and for the past two years was in the firm's Sydney, Australia, office. </TEXT></DOC>
