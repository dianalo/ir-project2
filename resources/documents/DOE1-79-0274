These can be organized into four broad categories:tack-on; intuitive/empirical; formal; and conversational. There are severalimportant interface design criteria that have never been adequately attainedin any of these approaches. One is modularity, that is, maintaining aclear separation between the interface and its target system. A secondcriterion is self-adaptation, or the ability of the interface of modifyits own behavior to suit a given individual user. Two further criteriarelate to the interface's potential to guide users in performing typicalhigh-level tasks on the target system and to provide intelligent adviceon the use of that system. This research was focused on developing anintegrated technique for achieving these four design criteria. To thatend, an abstract architecture called SAUCI, of the Self-Adaptive User-ComputerInterface, was proposed, embodying a knowledge-based, object-orientedapproach to interface design. The foundation of this approach rests uponinformation encoded within sets of objects. To test the feasibility ofthe proposed architecture, a working interface was implemented on a Xerox1108 computer in the LOOPS language, with a UNIX operating system runningon a separate minicomputer as the target system.</TEXT></DOC>
