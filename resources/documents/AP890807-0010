The 1,000-page bill, adopted by Congress early Saturday, is themost significant financial law adopted since the Depression. As thelargest government bailout ever, it will cost each taxpayer about$1,000 over 30 years to close or merge hundreds of insolvent thriftinstitutions hemorrhaging losses at the rate of $20 million a day.   It provides the most sweeping reorganization of the regulatorybureaucracy in 50 years. Beyond that, it means fewer thriftinstitutions, lower deposit rates for savers and reduced propertyvalues in some regions.   ``No doubt it will take years, if not decades, to determine whatgood and ... what evil this legislation has wrought,'' said KennethA. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent BankersAssociation of America. ``It is of historic scope.''   The first and most visible result likely will be noticed bydepositors in failed institutions that will soon come under newownership. The thrifts now must offer high-yielding certificates ofdeposit just to keep enough cash coming in to stay afloat.   When regulators finally get the money to close or infuse cash inthe institutions, they will have less need for deposits and will beable to let deposit rates slip. More importantly, that will givetheir healthy competitors, both banks and Sandamp;Ls, room to lower theirrates as well.   ``From a depositor's viewpoint it's the last chance to catch thehigh-yielding CD (certificate of deposit) train,'' said AlexSheshunoff, a financial institutions consultant in Austin, Texas.   ``If somebody wants to get on it, they better get on it withinthe next month. The government is going to move as quickly aspossible against those thrifts that are paying exorbitantly highrates,'' he said.   That, in turn, may allow savings and loans and banks to chargeborrowers slightly lower rates, he said.   Another provision that could potentially hurt depositors nearlydoubles the insurance premiums charged banks and boosts the alreadyhigher rates charged to thrifts by 10 percent.   Bert Ely, an analyst based in Alexandria, Va., said institutionswill be loath to pass on the fees to big depositors who move theirmoney in and out of accounts in chunks of $100,000 or more.   Small depositors and checking account customers more likely willfeel the pinch, he said.   As many as two-thirds of the nation's nearly 3,000 Sandamp;Ls will bebought out or closed, Ely said, predicting ``massive consolidationsall over the country.''   The first round will come through government action againstfailed thrifts, but the second round will come as commercial banksbegin buying weakened but still-solvent thrift associations, hesaid.   The bill, for the first time since the scheme of the U.S.financial system was set in the 1930s, permits banks to buy solventSandamp;Ls.   ``I'm amazed at how many banks, even small banks, are interestedin buying a thrift,'' said Guenther, whose organization representssmall banks.   By restricting thrifts more closely to home mortgage lending,and discouraging diversification into areas considered more risky,but also potentially more lucrative, the bill makes it moredifficult for thrifts that do not become part of a larger bankingorganization to remain profitable, Guenther said.   The legislation not only shakes up the financial industry, itwill rattle the real estate business, unsettling markets _particularly in depressed oil-producing areas of the Southwest _but also providing unprecedented opportunity for real estateinvestors and consultants to make a killing.   Texas, Louisiana, Colorado, Oklahoma and Arizona are among thestates most vulnerable if regulators embark on a real estate firesale.   ``That is one of the major hidden impacts of the bill,''Sheshunoff said. ``To the extent that the government disposes ofreal estate unwisely it's going to drive down prices in someareas.''</TEXT></DOC>
