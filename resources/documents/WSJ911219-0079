Jordan's leading daily, Al-Ra'i, claimed in a recenteditorial that a &quot;media blackout&quot; was imposed by the U.S. aspart of a conspiracy to bolster Israel's position. Israelclaims it preferred the low-key coverage, but it, too, is soconcerned about courting U.S. public opinion that it held adaily news briefing featuring its most telegenic spokesman.</LP><TEXT>   Even Israeli television, which had provided four hours ofdaily live coverage when the Washington talks began, for mostof this week cut back to a daily two-minute taped report.   The decline in interest demonstrates that with the end ofthe Cold War, the Arab-Israeli conflict is commanding lessattention world-wide. At some point, this may encourage Arabsand Israelis to stop playing to the media and startnegotiating more seriously.   Nevertheless, the lessened interest in the short termmeans that without outside pressure, particularly from theU.S., Mideast peace negotiations are likely to drag on. Moreprocedural jockeying lies ahead, this time involving where tohold the next round of talks. Israel wants them in or nearthe Mideast; the Arabs would prefer to return to Washingtonnext month. Israel announced at a news conference that therewas agreement with the joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegationto reconvene -- somewhere -- Jan. 7. An Israeli official saidlater that Israel prefers different starting dates for thenext round of sessions with Syria and Lebanon.   Even though the 65 hours of discussions in Washington haveaccomplished little so far, the Mideast peace process isn'tlikely to collapse in the months ahead. That's because Arabsand Israelis don't want to risk alienating Washington rightnow.   Israelis are alarmed that their sinking support in theU.S. could hurt their chances of obtaining $10 billion inloan guarantees. The Bush administration will take up therequest early next year, but the outcome is far from assured.A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that U.S.voters by 41% to 29% see Israel rather than the Arabs as thebiggest obstacle to peace in the Middle East.   Moreover, a neo-isolationist mood fed by domestic problemsis sweeping the U.S. The recent release of the last U.S. inthe Middle East, Terry Anderson, offered yet another reasonfor the U.S. to disengage somewhat from the region. AndIsrael is worried by the anti-foreign aid message ofconservative presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan and anumber of Democratic contenders.   Arab delegations, for their part, are determined to keepthe talks going so that any failure will be blamed on Israel.&quot;I've heard the Arabs say their main strategy now is to notbe perceived as the obstacle to negotiations,&quot; said a privateanalyst.   At a news conference, Moaffac Allaf, head of the Syriandelegation, said, &quot;It's no secret that no real progress wasachieved during the two weeks of negotiations here inWashington.&quot; And Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian spokeswoman,contended at a separate news conference that the Israelis&quot;wanted to waste time because they want to create theimpression that they are part of the process without allowingthe process to go on.&quot;   Israel's chief spokesman for the talks, BenjaminNetanyahu, claimed, &quot;We have made significant headway inthese talks.&quot; The heads of Israel's three delegations were ina jovial mood at their closing news conference, perhapsreflecting their relief in leaving Washington without havingthe U.S. administration inject itself into the process as itdid last month when the parties couldn't agree where to holdtalks.   Palestinians wanted the U.S. to resolve a disputeinvolving the rules under which Israel would negotiateseparately with Jordanian and Palestinian teams. The U.S.refused, and the parties spent 30 hours bargainingunsuccessfully in a State Department corridor.   Nevertheless, without the glare of the media spotlight,these enemies, who haven't talked peace since Israel wasfounded in 1948, did make some contacts that could be usefulin the future.   Lebanese and Syrian delegations met daily with theIsraelis even while the Palestinians and Israelis remained atloggerheads. The Israeli-Syrian talks were stiff and chilly,but both sides said the Israeli-Lebanese talks were cordial.   &quot;The human touch is important,&quot; said an Israeli official.&quot;To get to know your counterpart creates some kind of channelof human interaction.&quot; And a Lebanese official, in a far moreoptimistic assessment, said: &quot;When I sit with the Israelis, Isee the friends of tomorrow.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
