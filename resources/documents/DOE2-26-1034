The Instituteof Occupational Hygiene of the Uranium Industry measured the responseof thermoluminescence detectors (TL) in a radon chamber. Two CaSO/sub4/:Tm in teflon disks were used as TL detectors. Different configurationswere tested of detectors shielded with different absorbers. The measurementsproceeded at two ventilation speeds in the sample vicinity and at thesame concentration of latent energy (the so-called working level) andthe same irradiation time. The results of the measurement of TL detectorresponse in different conditions are tabulated and discussed in detail.The TL detector response was also measured in dependence on the concentrationof potential energy at different configurations. A homogeneous mediumwas provided in the radon chamber. The detectors were fitted in a specialholder accommodating 12 detectors in three configurations. The detectorsin the radon chamber were irradiated simultaneously at certain time intervalsat one potential energy concentration. The detector response to the timeintegral is shown graphically. The TL detector response was also experimentallydetermined with the detectors covered with aluminium of different thicknesses.The results are tabulated. Finally, the response was measured of theTL detectors in a room with occurrence of radon and its daughters. Themeasurement was performed using the TL detectors and a diffusion chamber.The errors are discussed of determining the potential latent energy concentrationusing the thermoluminescence method.
