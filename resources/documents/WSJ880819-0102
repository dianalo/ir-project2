Add some aggressive investment bankers and a few profitable Fortune 500 companies out to shrink their federal tax payments and -- voila! -- a tax bonanza for all involved.    That is what Congress served up in 1986, the year it set out to end most tax shelters. Lawmakers passed a provision that allows troubled firms owned by Alaskan Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts to sell their tax &quot;losses&quot; to companies seeking a tax write-off. However well-intentioned, the move has proved far more costly to taxpayers, and much more enriching to the businesses involved, than anyone planned. It has also been blamed for some alarming side-effects, including the deforestation of Alaskan land and efforts by some of the Alaskan corporations to generate artificial losses.    &quot;Creative investment bankers and others may have turned a legitimate policy enacted by the Congress into a significant tax loophole,&quot; complains Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. In 1986, Congress estimated that the provision would cost taxpayers $50 million over five years, but the cost is already about $300 million and could eventually reach $1 billion, congressional aides say.    Proponents see the measure as a much-deserved effort to help disadvantaged Native Americans whose hard times are partly the fault of Washington's insensitivity and bureaucratic delay.    But critics condemn the Alaska-natives provision as a tax break run amok, a case study of why the tax code shouldn't be used for social policy.    &quot;It's special-interest legislation of a classic kind,&quot; says Roscoe Egger, a partner at Price Waterhouse Inc. and former commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. &quot;I don't know how you could possibly justify it as good tax policy.&quot; Mr. Rostenkowski wants to eliminate the Alaska-natives tax break. It isn't clear whether Congress will act this year. But as Congress debates, the deals continue.    Ironically, the provision was inserted into the broad 1986 tax revision, which eliminated most tax shelters. The Alaska-natives measure was sponsored by Sen. Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican, and was left intact as a way to ensure Sen. Stevens's support of the broader tax bill. Since it was one of just a few tax loopholes that remained under the 1986 tax law, it was an instant hit among such companies as Marriott Corp., Campbell Soup Co. and Pillsbury Co. Although these firms aren't generally known for their financial dealings with Eskimos, Aleuts and Indians, they moved quickly to save millions of dollars in tax payments by applying tax losses of Native American corporations against their own income.    First, some Alaskan corporations sold the losses they piled up over the years through failed ventures in construction, oil refining and seafood processing. But then the transactions took an unexpected turn. When the supply of operating losses grew thin, the deal-makers turned to so-called nonoperating losses, or those bookkeeping losses the Alaskan companies claimed on the drop in value of their resources, such as timber, oil and gas. To unlock the losses, the corporations sell the assets at current market prices, which are substantially less than the book value.    &quot;We were the first to say, 'Use nonoperating losses,'&quot; brags Stephen Norris, a director of the Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C., merchant-banking firm that has handled some of the transactions. &quot;We taught them {the Alaskan corporations} that they have huge losses for tax purposes.&quot; The sales of nonoperating losses explain the unexpectedly high cost of the tax break to the federal government.    Moreover, environmentalists charge that certain Alaskan corporations are pursuing business ventures just to realize -- and then sell -- losses. In particular, the environmentalists say the companies are rushing to harvest trees, thus hastening the deforestation of the state and threatening wildlife.    &quot;The tax loophole encourages unprofitable business at the expense of the environment,&quot; argues Richard Steiner, an assistant professor of fisheries at the University of Alaska.    He says residents of the Prince William Sound region fear that excess siltation resulting from the logging operations may cut off the oxygen supply to young salmon gills. Too-rapid loss of forests, which soak up excess rainfall, will mean muddier streams, adding to the problem, he says.    The House voted to close the loophole in a technical tax bill it passed earlier this month. But the Senate Finance Committee didn't act to close the Alaska tax break when it passed the technical measure. The full Senate is expected to act on the bill next month and could move to end or limit the Alaska-natives tax break then.    An investment banker who has been involved in at least one transaction this summer says &quot;several more very significant deals&quot; are ready to go forward if the effective date of any change in the legislation slips beyond this summer.    Transactions involving Doyon Ltd., a Fairbanks-based company, show how the tax provision works. Doyon is one of the native corporations Congress established in 1971. In settlement of aboriginal claims, the government agreed to distribute land and other assets to the corporations, but delays prevented many of the companies from getting quick control of minerals, timber, oil and gas until well after prices had peaked.    Although some of the native corporations have done well, others have suffered from a lack of business experience. Doyon is an example of the latter. The company piled up losses from bad investments in a construction project and in a small refinery that never got off the ground. But, under the 1986 law, Doyon has been free to peddle its losses to the highest bidder. In one transaction, Hilton Hotels Corp. purchased $40 million in losses, which, at the company's 40% effective tax rate in 1987, was worth $16 million in deductions. Of that, it agreed to return $14 million to Doyon, leaving a net tax saving of $2 million for Hilton.    Campbell Soup says it paid the corporation around $40 million for an amount of losses that it won't disclose in a transaction that yielded $45 million in deductions and reduced its net tax bill by about $5 million. Marriott bought about $40 million in losses.    Hungry for tax breaks, the corporations quickly bid up the prices they would pay for the tax losses, giving the Alaskan firms a windfall equal to 80% or more of the value of the tax savings the outside corporations were realizing.    Then they went hunting for nonoperating losses. Doyon, for example, generated losses based on the difference between the value of its asbestos deposit when it received it from the government and the value when Doyon sold the mining rights to a Canadian firm.    The overall effect on federal coffers swelled as some corporations revalued their properties and generated bigger losses to sell. Goldbelt Inc., a native corporation based in Juneau, received about 30,000 acres of land and timber from the government in 1979. At the time, the timber was valued conservatively at around $60 million, according to Goldbelt's former president, Joseph Kahklen. In the mid-1980s, before Congress approved the tax break for the Alaskan companies, Goldbelt noticed other corporations were handling their timber depletion differently. So the company hired a consultant, who told Goldbelt its timber was undervalued and pegged the original worth close to $150 million.    The revised original value helped boost the tax losses available for sale. Goldbelt sold $110 million in losses, earning $37.5 million and allowing it to pay off close to $20 million in debt. Some of the money remains in escrow pending an IRS ruling.    Pointing to such transactions, Rep. Rostenkowski insists that &quot;Congress never intended to encourage Alaska native corporations to create artificial losses and split the resulting tax benefits with profitable corporations.&quot; Defenders of the provision note that all valuations of this sort are subject to IRS audit and contend that many of the original valuations were too conservative.    Craig Burger, chief operating officer of Cape Fox Corp., a native corporation based in Ketchikan, Alaska, says the tax loss sales have been &quot;good public policy&quot; because they have infused cash into struggling native corporations that, in turn, can invest in the Alaskan economy. This has given Cape Fox &quot;an opportunity to learn from its mistakes and a chance to determine its future for its shareholders,&quot; he says. Mr. Burger insists that the government has an obligation to bail out the native companies. &quot;Sooner or later Congress would have had to deal with the recapitalization {of the corporations} anyway.&quot;    When Sen. Stevens proposed the amendment in 1986, he asserted it was &quot;grounded in social policy and not in tax policy considerations.&quot; Today he defends the provision, saying it &quot;was needed and has served . . . the purpose for which it was intended.&quot; He says he supports extending the provision for certain corporations that haven't been able to take full advantage of it yet.    That could mean a special windfall for those lucky few. Patrick Beattie, a partner at Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co. in Anchorage, says that if only a few transactions are permitted by new legislation, the non-Alaskan corporations seeking a tax writeoff are likely to bid up the price -- a boon for the Native American companies. &quot;It could be quite lucrative for those that are allowed to continue,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
