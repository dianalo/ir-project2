(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge said his decision torelease 4,200 Austrian-made rifles impounded as part of a Bushadministration ban on imported assault weapons still leaves abigger question far from settled.   U.S. District Judge William Acker Jr. said the rifles should bereleased to Gun South Inc. of nearby Trussville ``while the broadernational debate continues to rage.''   His ruling came Wednesday in Gun South's lawsuit, apparently thefirst challenge of the administration's temporary ban onimportation of semiautomatic rifles.   Acker criticized the ban, initiated by federal drug policycoordinator William Bennett, as ``obviously the product of a`hurry-up' skull session, if not a stampede reaction set off byBennett.''   Acker said the government must release 1,200 Steyr AUG-SA riflesimpounded by the U.S. Customs Service at the Birmingham airport,and allow another 3,000 to be sent to Gun South from Austria.   His ruling does not directly affect the moratorium on additionalimport permits for 29 other kinds of assault rifles until theadministration decides whether they are used for legitimatesporting purposes.   But the judge criticized even that part of the policy,contending the administration overstepped its bounds and interferedwith Congress' right to enact laws.   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said in Washington thedepartment was reviewing Acker's decision and had yet to decidewhether to appeal. An appeal could delay delivery of the guns,which sell from $900 to $1,000 each.   ``I applaud the judge's decision,'' said James J. Baker, federalaffairs director of the National Rifle Association while attendingan NRA meeting in St. Louis.   At an April 6 hearing before Acker, a Justice Departmentattorney described the ban on assault weapons as a life and deathmatter, but Gun South argued that the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms approved import permits for the rifles beforethe ban was announced in late March.   Gun South owner Don Wood testified that the ban could put himout of business.   Semiautomatic weapons became an issue after reports of their usein drug-linked killings and in the slaying of five children and thewounding of 30 others in a California schoolyard in January.   Acker said the government offered no evidence that the SteyrAUG-SA failed to meet the hunting qualification contained in theban.   ``To the contrary, all of the evidence in this case demonstratesthat the Steyr AUG is designed and marketed to be predominantly asporting weapon,'' the judge said.   He said that the ``only thing that has changed is anadministration in Washington and perhaps the perception of theproportion of the drug and gun crisis.''</TEXT></DOC>
