At least four U.S.-built jetliners, in addition to the Boeing 737that crashed Sunday in England killing 44 people, have experiencedthe loss of all their engines in flight, according to governmentrecords:   _Last May, an El Salvadoran Taca Airlines 737 lost both engineswhile descending in a thunderstorm near New Orleans but managed toland safely on a levee.   _In August 1987, another 737 belonging to a European regionalairline lost power in a snowstorm over Greece, but pilots restartedthe engines.   _In May 1983, an Eastern Airlines Lockheed L-1011 en route fromMiami to the Bahamas lost all three of its engines, but pilotsmanaged to restart one and land safely back in Miami. Investigatorsconcluded that maintenance workers neglected to check that criticaloil seals were in place.   _In April 1977, a Southern Airways DC9 lost power in its twoengines in a hailstorm and crash-landed in New Hope, Ga., killing 62people and injuring 23 others.   The four incidents occurred over a period when U.S. airlinerswere logging between 6 million and 7 million flights a year. ABritish investigator said there was a one in 10 million chance ofboth of a two-engine airliner's engines failing on the same flight.   The two incidents involving 737s powered by CFM56 engines likethose on the British flight led the Federal Aviation Administrationto issue air worthiness directives ordering pilots to take specialprocedures during landings in stormy weather.   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the directives would not haveapplied to the British flight, however, because it was in clearweather and at a high altitude when the first engine failed.   Although some officials at the scene in England initially saidpilot error was not to blame, investigators said Tuesday they werelooking into the possibility that the pilot erroneously shut downhis remaining good engine instead of the one that caught fire in theair.   National Transportation Safety Board records show 92 doubleengine failures in U.S. airplanes since 1962, but the vast majoritywere in small planes that ran out of gas.   When both engines on a plane go out, investigators normally wouldlook at the performance of the pilot, particularly actions takenafter one engine fails, along with the engines themselves, the fueland electrical systems, and the possibility of sabotage ormaintenance failure, among other possible causes.   Planes with the CFM56 engines such as those used on the 737 havebeen involved in 13 air accidents or incidents, including four thatwere attributed to engine trouble, according to safety board records.   Two days before the British Midland crash, a federal judge inCincinnati ordered the unsealing of a four-month-old lawsuit thatalleges that components in engines including the CFM56s used in thenew Boeing 737 that crashed in England were inadequately tested at aGeneral Electric plant in Seattle, Wash., and that the companyfalsified test reports on military engines.   GE has denied inadequate testing of any CFM56s, and FAA spokesmanFarrar said a timer assembly for the engines involved in the suitcould not have caused the British crash. He said its failure wouldonly cause a small increase in engine temperature but not fire.   Farrar said no government investigation of engine testing isplanned before investigators determine the cause of the crash.   ``Any engine has to meet very rigid requirements as toperformance and construction,'' said Farrar. ``There is no reason tobelieve the GE engines had any fatal flaw.''   The engines were thoroughly tested in France, at the GE plant inthe United States and again after they were installed in the planein Seattle, said General Electric spokesman William Shumann. He saidabout 1,000 of the engines are in use.   But James Helmer, lawyer for former GE Seattle plant managerAnthony DiVincenzo, who filed the suit, said the timer part andpossibly other GE-built components of the CFM56 were inadequatelytested. He said DiVincenzo secretly filed his suit after he exposedinadequate testing to GE officials and was demoted and reassigned toa plant in Cincinnati.   ``The government should have been investigating this engine sixmonths ago, not after 44 people are killed,'' Helmer said in atelephone interview.   Helmer said a team of whistleblower lawyers would conduct aninvestigation of engine manufacturing, including visits to the GEplant in Seattle, an examination of documents on engine tests anddepositions from plant workers and officials.   The CFM56 engines on the British plane were manufactured inFrance with both U.S. and French components under an agreementbetween GE and the French company SNECMA. The CFM56s used on 737shave been in service for about five years.</TEXT></DOC>
