Harris Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> BA GOVMT </CO><IN> ARO AIR </IN><TEXT>   A dispute between Aloha Airlines Inc. and Boeing Co. over Aloha's maintenance record is likely to flare as public hearings open on the in-flight loss April 28 of part of a Boeing 737 fuselage.    The National Transportation Safety Board has said that, in addition to concentrating on airline maintenance and inspection programs, the four days of hearings in Seattle will focus on Boeing's engineering design of the early-model 737.    Specifically, the safety board will cover the way Boeing bonded overlapping 737 fuselage sectional joints before it eventually changed the process, and its fail-safe design philosophy. The Federal Aviation Administration's fail-safe requirements mandate that manufacturers provide backup systems to prevent one failure from having catastrophic consequences.    The 19-year-old Aloha 737 landed in Maui after losing an 18-foot section above passengers' heads during an interisland flight. A flight attendant was swept to her death and scores of others on board were injured. Investigators have said corrosion and metal fatigue are suspected as contributing to the Aloha plane's problems.    The accident has spotlighted the increasing age of U.S. airline fleets, many with planes designed in the early 1960s using technology that later was improved.    The hearings also will consider the question of &quot;continuing airworthiness in the face of corrosion and structural fatigue problems,&quot; according to the safety board.    Aloha last month released several Boeing communications with the airline, showing that for months before the accident Boeing had criticized Aloha's maintenance operation. In the documents, which had become part of the investigation record, the Seattle-based aerospace concern suggested that Aloha hire its own structural engineer to monitor safety of older planes. Boeing said the airline was operating in a &quot;deteriorated condition.&quot; Boeing also said Aloha's maintenance shop compared unfavorably with that of other 737 operations, and was undermanned and hurt by poor morale.    Honolulu-based Aloha has disputed the claims by Boeing, and said that despite the harsh words from the manufacturer there wasn't ever a suggestion &quot;that Aloha's four older aircraft presented a safety problem.&quot; Boeing has described its letters to Aloha as citing problems &quot;that had the possibility of having safety ramifications if they weren't corrected.&quot;    A safety board spokesman said investigators so far have attached little relevance to the 1981 crash in Taiwan of a 737 that apparently had a serious corrosion and metal-fatigue problem in the same fuselage section where the Aloha plane failed. He said the board had obtained the Taiwanese report on that crash, which killed 110 when the plane came apart in flight. He added, however, that evidence in the report pointed to corrosion in the belly area, rather than the top of the fuselage, as the apparent cause of that crash.    Barry L. Trotter, the investigator in charge in the Aloha case, is scheduled to begin the testimony today, with Aloha executives following and Boeing aircraft-structures specialists appearing later in the week. The safety board said it expects a report on the probable cause of the accident in several months. </TEXT></DOC>
