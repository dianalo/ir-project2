By comparison, nearly all the others are weak in the knees.    If the Republican contest becomes a two-man race between Vice President Bush and Sen. Dole, as expected, then money won't play much of a role in determining the nominee. Both men have the ability to raise the roughly $28 million that federal law allows them to spend. Mr. Bush, in fact, has already raised so much --$18.7 million in private donations --that he plans to cease all fund-raising efforts soon.    Among Democrats, Gov. Dukakis of Massachusetts has a clear financial advantage over his rivals. &quot;Dukakis's bank account guarantees his presence in the field through Super Tuesday, almost regardless of voters' decisions,&quot; says Washington consultant William Sweeney, who produces detailed analyses of presidential campaign finances. Super Tuesday is March 8, when 20 states hold presidential contests.    The Dukakis campaign raised $10.8 million during 1987, more than double the $4.4 million raised by Rep. Richard Gephardt or the $3.8 million raised by Sen. Albert Gore. Gov. Dukakis is already looking beyond Iowa and New Hampshire, planning a &quot;substantial&quot; purchase of advertising in the Super Tuesday states, according to Finance Director Robert Farmer. Mr. Farmer says the Dukakis effort now employs 300 people, with offices in 40 states. Rep. Gephardt's staff is roughly one-third as large.    Money won't be much of a factor in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8 or the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 16, for which almost all the candidates say they can afford to spend the maximum allowed by federal law: roughly $775,000 in Iowa and $460,000 in New Hampshire. A notable exception is GOP contender Al Haig, who announced last week he is pulling out of Iowa entirely to concentrate on the New Hampshire contest, apparently for lack of funds.    The financial landscape can change rapidly. Year-end financial figures show Sen. Gore in surprisingly strong financial shape; his extraordinarily frugal campaign has husbanded more than $2.3 million, which it intends to spend mainly in Super Tuesday states. Sen. Gore is intentionally running a shoestring campaign in Iowa and hasn't decided whether to spend the maximum in New Hampshire. Sen. Paul Simon's income is surging; he raised $1.7 million in the last three months of 1987, only one-third less than Gov. Dukakis raised in the same period. Sen. Simon's fund-raisers predict he'll clear $1 million during January alone.    Candidates who do well in Iowa and New Hampshire should attract a flood of media attention and donations. &quot;You pick up financial momentum as well as political momentum,&quot; says Mark Johnson, spokesman for Rep. Gephardt. But money dries up for those who stumble, as Sen. John Glenn discovered in 1984.    Indeed, even the hand-to-mouth campaign of Bruce Babbitt is now in far better financial shape than was the Gary Hart effort at the start of 1984. Mr. Hart was then in the red by $468,000, and Sen. Glenn seemed the only Democrat financially strong enough to challenge Walter Mondale. But money poured into Mr. Hart's campaign after his 1984 New Hampshire victory, making the Democratic contest a two-man race between him and Mr. Mondale.    A big riddle is the campaign of evangelist Pat Robertson. Rivals once feared he would be able to raise unlimited sums from his video flock, but he seems to have fallen on lean times. With year-end debts of about $1.5 million and only about $400,000 in the bank, the Robertson campaign reluctantly agreed to accept $4.5 million in federal subsidy funds even though Mr. Robertson says he loathes them and may try to give them back. Taking the money subjects the Robertson campaign to federal spending limits and a thorough post-campaign audit.    All agree that money confers some advantage, especially to any candidate with millions to spend in the Super Tuesday states. A heavy schedule of advertising in Texas and Florida would cost $1 million per state, estimates Rep. Jack Kemp's campaign manager, Charles Black. A Democratic campaign manager figures it would cost $8 million to air commercials often enough to be seen 20 times by the typical viewer in all Southern Super Tuesday states.    &quot;Money helps,&quot; says Lee Atwater, manager of the affluent Bush campaign, &quot;and this year it helps more than ever.&quot; But others argue that money now matters less, because of a proliferation of public debates giving candidates loads of free publicity.    Mr. Hart, still trying to fend off creditors of his 1984 campaign, leads in the polls and trails in funds. And Jesse Jackson remains a player despite a debt-ridden campaign that failed to complete paper work required to get federal matching funds on time today.    Says Mr. Jackson's campaign manager Gerald Austin, &quot;There are things that money can't buy.&quot;    ---                  Presidential Balance Sheet -    Financial positions of campaigns as of Jan. 1, 1988            CASH ON        DEBTS     FEDERAL              HAND         OWED     MONEY DUE      BALANCE Republicans    Bush   $5,500,000          $0   $5,761,541  $11,261,541    Dole    2,000,000           0    4,338,141    6,338,141    DuPont          0     900,000    1,868,762      968,762    Haig      100,000         Und.     274,851            *    Kemp      160,000   3,200,000    3,012,949      (27,051)    Robertson 400,000   1,500,000    4,495,608    3,395,608 Democrats    Babbitt   $50,000    $629,000    $ 719,235     $140,235    Dukakis 2,000,000           0    3,493,419    5,493,419    Gephardt  400,000   1,500,000    1,737,216      637,216    Gore      800,000           0    1,556,401    2,365,401    Hart         Und.
