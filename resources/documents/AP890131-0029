The request is contained in a U.S. District Court lawsuit filedMonday by the Foundation on Economic Trends and its president,Jeremy Rifkin.   It asks for an injunction to block plans by researchers at theNational Institute of Health to use a rat virus to manipulate a genein an experimental treatment of melanoma, a virulent and often fatalskin cancer.   The suit claims that the institute's Recombinant DNA AdvisoryCommittee, which reviews human genetic engineering experiments,approved the cancer therapy without conducting proper publichearings.   As the suit was being filed in downtown Washington on Monday,Rifkin and others in the foundation met with the 25-member committeeat the institute's offices in Maryland for a heated discussion ofRifkin's proposal that the NIH be required to form a citizen'scommittee to evaluate dangers involved in human genetic engineering.   Members of the institute's advisory group voted 23-0, with twomembers abstaining, against forming the citizens committee. Rifkinvowed to ``come back again and again and again'' with his proposal.   The lawsuit asks the court to block the first formal attempt everto insert a foreign gene into human beings.   The suit targets research approved earlier this month to treatmelanoma patients with a type of white blood cell, called a tumorinfiltrating lymphocyte (TIL), that has been genetically altered.   TIL cells are developed by the body in small numbers to fight thegrowth of melanoma tumors.   Three NIH researchers, Steven A. Rosenberg, R. Michael Blaese andW. French Anderson, showed in earlier work that TIL cells can beused to battle cancer by taking them from a patient's tumor, growingthem in large numbers in the laboratory, and then reinserting theminto the patient. In results published in December, the techniquewas at least partially successful in 12 of 20 patients.   To understand why TIL therapy works for some, but not others, thescientists want to trace the white blood cells after they arereturned to the patient. In order to do this, the researchers wantto mark the cells with a bacterial gene that produces a resistanceto neomycin, an antibiotic. In this way, cells from the patient'stumors or blood stream could be identified and movement of the cellsinto the tumors could be monitored.   But in order to get the gene of the bacteria into the white bloodcells, the scientists proposed to use a rat leukemia retrovirus. Itwas the use of this virus that triggered the lawsuit.   The study proposed that the experimental therapy be used on 10melanoma patients with a life expectancy of just 90 days, and thatit not be used on other patients until the technique is re-evaluated.   The research proposal underwent seven months of reviews,including hearings by NIH committees, the Food and DrugAdministration and a congressional committee. On Jan. 18, James B.Wyngaarden, director of the NIH, gave final approval.   In their lawsuit, Rifkin and the Foundation on Economic Trendssay the approval was not proper because a subcommittee review of theproposal was not conducted with public notice and publicparticipation, and that final approval by the full committee was bya mailed ballot, instead of in a public hearing.   A court clerk said the case has been assigned to the court ofU.S. District Judge John G. Penn. No hearing had been scheduledMonday, but the clerk said it would probably be sometime this week.</TEXT></DOC>
