The Federal Reserve Board said that the January increase wasjust half the 0.4 percent gain recorded in both November andDecember.   Private analysts said this slower growth was consistent withtheir view that the economy will slow considerably in the earlypart of 1988 as businesses work off a backlog of unsold inventoriesbuilt up during the final three months of 1987.   Strength in domestic production helped push the overall economy,as measured by the gross national product, to a robust annualgrowth rate of 4.2 percent from October through December. However,nearly three-fourths of that strength went into inventories ratherthan final sales.   Analysts said this backlog will have to be worked off in comingmonths and will translate into an extremely sluggish economy in thefirst three months of this year.   Lawrence Chimerine, president of the WEFA Group, a privateforecasting firm, said that the smaller rise in industrialproduction was consistent with this view.   ``We are seeing a slowdown in domestic demand, not only forcars, but other consumer durables and this will hold downindustrial production even though we are getting some offsettingstrength from stronger export sales,'' he said.   Some economists are predicting GNP growth could be an actualnegative number from January though March, but most expect growthwill resume in the spring, keeping the country out of a recession.   ``We are seeing that while the economy is slowing down, thingsare not stopping. We think we will have sluggish growth in thefirst half of the year but no recession,'' said David Wyss, seniorfinancial economist at Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.   The January increase in industrial production, the fourth in arow, left output 6 percent above where it was a year ago, providingfurther evidence of the rebound manufacturers are enjoying as theweaker dollar boosts U.S. exports to record levels.   The Reagan administration is counting on the export strength tokeep the country out of a recession this year.   Output in the manufacturing sector rose 0.2 percent in Januaryfollowing a much larger 0.5 percent December advance.   The strength came from industries producing non-durable goods,where production rose by 0.4 percent.   Output of durable goods, items expected to last at least threeyears, showed no change at all in January.   Production of cars fell by 7.4 percent in January to an annualrate of 6.5 million units. The impact of this fall was offset inpart, however, by an increase in production of light trucks andmini-vans, which have now captured about one-third of the U.S.consumer market.   Also contributing to the weakness last month was a decline iniron and steel production, which fell back following a sharp risein December.   The mining industry suffered a 0.6 percent drop in January, thesecond consecutive monthly downturn. This sector, which includesoil and gas well drilling, has been battered by depressedconditions caused by falling world energy prices.   The utility sector had a big 1.3 percent increase in January,reflecting colder-than-normal weather which drove up the use ofelectricity and natural gas.   The various changes left the industrial production index at133.8 percent of its 1977 base of 100.</TEXT></DOC>
