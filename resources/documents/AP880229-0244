He's now 42 years old and an active member of West Germany'santi-establishment, environmentalist Greens Party _ the moderatewing _ and publishes a left-leaning regional magazine in Frankfurt.   He ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Frankfurt in 1986 in a purelysymbolic move, he said. But he is considering seriously running forFrankfurt's city council next year.   Cohn-Bendit has also become an author. A collection ofinterviews with other 1960s activists around the world waspublished in West Germany in September.   American activists featured in the book include Jerry Rubin andAbbie Hoffmann, leading Yippies of the era, and the Black Pantheractivist, Bobby Seale.   The book, ``We Loved It So, The Revolution,'' portrays Rubin asa Yippie-turned-Yuppie and Seale as hoping for commercial successas a cookbook author.   His book isn't the only look back: West Germany's news mediahave carried numerous articles on the tumultuous times of 1968.   Cohn-Bendit said that he has basically remained true to manyviews he had 20 years ago.   ``I believe that I can still legitimize everything I do from mystandpoint in 1968,'' Cohn-Bendit said.   As a moderate member of the Greens, Cohn-Bendit favors formingcoalitions with West Germany's liberal Social Democratic Party,which the Greens' radical wing opposes. Nor does Cohn-Bendit favora West German withdrawal from NATO, as some of the radicals do.   ``West German militarization is more dangerous on its own thanembedded in a larger context,'' he said. ``That's the lesson ofWorld War II.''   Cohn-Bendit has always been a figure who defied traditionalnational, political, and religious labels. He was born inMontauban, France, on April 4, 1945, the son of German Jews whofled Hitler's persecution in the 1930s.   His parents moved to West Germany when Cohn-Bendit was 13. In1961 Cohn-Bendit became a West German citizen.   ``I did it only for pragmatical reasons,'' he said. ``I didn'twant to serve in the military.''   Jews whose parents or siblings were persecuted under the Nazisare by West German law exempted from the country's mandatorymilitary service.   Cohn-Bendit, who speaks French and German fluently, said hedoesn't assign his national identify to either country. As a Frenchcitizen, he would have been subject to the military draft in France.   ``I'm just me. I'm not German or French,'' he added. ``I don'tneed a national definition.''   Cohn-Bendit's views have led to occasional flaps withFrankfurt's Jewish community. In a highly publicized dispute in1985 he publicly supported the city playhouse in presenting a playby Rainer Werner Fassbinder, which many Jews wanted banned asanti-Semitic.   In the Feb. 18 issue of his magazine ``Pflasterstrand,''Cohn-Bendit described himself as a ``convinced anti-Zionist.''   In the interview, he said he favored the existence of Israel butalso a separate Palestinian state and ``a limitation of Zionism.''   Tenants' housing rights and terrorist amnesty are among otherissues that have made Cohn-Bendit a household name.   But the era that propelled the activist to world fame, the1960s, is a topic Cohn-Bendit said he no longer wants to talk a lotabout.   In his book, originally published in France, he writes thatpeople have used him ``like a machine that turns back time.''   Cohn-Bendit captured world attention as a university student inFrance, at a time when youth protests were rocking the globe.   He was a spokesman for students whose demands included greatersocial equality and an end to war, in Vietnam and elsewhere. Dannythe Red became the leader of Paris' tumultuous _ and occasionallybloody _ student revolts.   ``We had the will to change our lives, to participate in historyright at the moment it happened,'' Cohn-Bendit writes of hisrevolutionary days.   In May 1968 French authorities expelled him from the country ongrounds of disturbing the peace. The ban was not officially lifteduntil 1978, Cohn-Bendit wrote in his book.   Cohn-Bendit lives with his girl friend, but he said he doesn'tintend to get married.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, March 2</NOTE></DOC>
