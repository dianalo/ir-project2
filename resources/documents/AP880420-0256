But the justices did not attempt to decide whether alcoholism isa disease, noting that the medical community remains sharplydivided on that issue.   Instead, the 4-3 decision said the Veterans Administration didnot violate a law protecting the rights of the handicapped when itrefused to extend education benefits to two men for more than 10years after they left the service.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., his Super Tuesday strategya failure outside the South, was packing away his presidentialambitions Wednesday after his dismal finish in the New YorkDemocratic primary.   His campaign more than $1.5 million in debt, Gore flew to Texasfor a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser. He scheduled a Washington newsconference for Thursday, which has been drop-out day throughoutthis presidential campaign.   A campaign source said the Tennessee senator would announce hewas halting his effort.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The road from here to California for JesseJackson is a rough one, strewn with ballot problems, unfavorablerules, small numbers of black voters, and big leads for MichaelDukakis in states from Pennsylvania to Ohio and beyond.   Eleven primaries remain before the Democratic NationalConvention in Atlanta, and only one _ the District of Columbia _offers Jackson a solid shot at victory.   The landscape is particularly difficult now that Dukakis hasopened a lead in the delegate count and is even winning thecumulative popular vote _ which Jackson had claimed was the mostimportant battle. Jackson needs at least two big-state victories inthe next seven weeks to have a hope of pulling back even with theMassachusetts governor.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mayor Edward I. Koch campaigned like a candidatein the New York Democratic primary _ and lost. Some say the effortmay have damaged his ambitions to become the city's first four-termmayor.   ``I have to work a little harder,'' Koch conceded Wednesday ashe looked back at the previous day's voting and ahead to his 1989re-election campaign. He admitted he may be vulnerable.   Koch had worked hard on behalf of Sen. Al Gore Jr. of Tennessee,but Gore's poor showing _ 10 percent statewide, 9 percent in NewYork City _ raised the question of whether the mayor had done moreharm than good.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Air Force, lifting a decade-long veil ofsecrecy, released pictures of its Stealth bomber on Wednesday andsaid the plane would make its first test flight this fall.   As disclosed in 1985 by former Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz.,the new long-range strategic bomber resembles a big ``flying wing''with no fuselage in the middle.   The Stealth bomber, officially designated the B-2, takes itsnickname from the fact it is designed to fly without showing up onradar.</TEXT><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Immigrant schoolchildren often are placed inclasses for the handicapped or at inappropriate grade levelsbecause schools can't cope with their cultural differences, says atwo-year study released Wednesday.   This is true even though ``the education level of many newimmigrants ... is superior to that of previous migrations,'' saidthe 129-page study, conducted by the Boston-based NationalCoalition of Advocates for Students and funded largely by the FordFoundation.   Rigid placement practices, lack of bilingual education, culturalinsensitivity, harassment from other students and fear ofdeportation all serve to undermine the education of immigrantyoungsters, the study found.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Consumer prices shot up 0.5 percent in Marchas a record increase in clothing costs and higher food and gasolineprices triggered the biggest jump in inflation in 14 months, thegovernment reported Wednesday.   Analysts said the sharp increase in the Labor Department'sConsumer Price Index, which translated into a 6.4 percent annualrate of increase, demonstrated that the weak dollar andunexpectedly strong consumer demand were threatening to ignite anew bout of inflation.   They said those pressures would soon prompt the Federal Reserveto step in with a dose of higher interest rates to cool off theeconomy.</TEXT><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Public speaking and other stressful encounters canbe as potent as hard exercise in disrupting the heart's bloodsupply when people have underlying heart disease, a study shows.   The researchers said their work gives scientific weight to thewidely held belief that mental stress can overtax the heart and maytrigger heart attacks.   They found that giving a public talk about one's shortcomingscan be as disruptive to the heart as exercising to exhaustion.However, it also appears that mental stress is a possible cardiacproblem only for people with heart disease, not for those withhealthy hearts.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A scientist who gave himself an experimentalAIDS vaccine says booster treatments have prolonged his defensesagainst the AIDS virus for more than a year.   Tests showed his body retained at least some defenses up to 370days after the initial vaccination, said Daniel Zagury of thePierre and Marie Curie University in Paris.   But nobody knows whether the vaccine and boosters would actuallyprevent infection by the AIDS virus, and the booster procedure istoo cumbersome for large-scale trials to test effectiveness, hesaid in a telephone interview.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Andy Warhol's huge and varied personalcollection goes on sale this week, offering a chance to see _ andbuy _ the paintings and pottery owned by the man who broughtCampbell's Soup to fine art.   Some say the sale provides a prime opportunity to learn whatmade the artist tick. If so, the lesson won't be easy.   Confronted with the 10,000 items on the block, ranging fromNavajo blankets to Edgar Degas sculpture to 134 cookie jars to aRolls Royce to a Superman touch-tone telephone, a student of theworld according to Warhol could be forgiven for resorting to CliffNotes.</TEXT></DOC>
