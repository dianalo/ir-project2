Lawrence Mayor Kevin Sullivan had ordered four months ago thatpolice gather evidence of possible welfare fraud whenever anyone issuspected of any crime. The cards were to be turned over to statewelfare authorities for investigation.   Sullivan said his depressed former mill town of 61,000 people istoo small and poor to be as easy on welfare cheats as he claims thestate is.   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge David Nelson ruled that the cityviolated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonablesearch and seizure when it took welfare IDs belonging to MariaOcasio, a 47-year-old mother of 11.   Police in Lawrence, 30 miles north of Boston, searched Ms.Ocasio's home March 7 with a warrant to look for drugs and seized11 bags of cocaine, six bags of marijuana, two marijuanacigarettes, 18 needles and syringes, and $481 in cash.   The police also took four welfare identification cards. Ms.Ocasio receives federal benefits for her children, food stamps andmedical benefits.   Judge David Nelson ruled that police had no right to take thecards because they had no cause to suspect Ms. Ocasio of welfarefraud.   Ms. Ocasio never was charged with welfare fraud.   Ms. Ocasio has her cards back and never lost her benefits, herlawyer said. But along with the father of some of her children,Wilfredo Santiago, she faces cocaine and marijuana charges. She isfree on her own recognizance.   Barbara Lybarger, who represented Ms. Ocasio, said about 120people have been affected, some after such petty crimes asshoplifting and disorderly conduct.   Mayor Sullivan said police must be more careful about protectingpeople's rights, but he defended his policy in principle.   ``We felt the Department of Welfare was negligent ininvestigating cases where drug dealers were getting access to thewelfare system, while making huge amounts of money,'' Sullivan saidin an interview.   ``The state tends to be soft on crime, through its humanservices department, by encouraging this type of activity, makingit easy to get on (welfare) with little or no checking.''   He said 13,000 people are on welfare in Lawrence. ``The city istrying to make an incentive to work, but the commonwealth is makingan incentive not to work,'' Sullivan said.   A state official said the mayor is wrong but reacting to hardtimes.   ``His city is in need. When times are tough and money getstight, we see the syndrome of blame the victim,'' said MichalRegunberg, spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Welfare.``It's no picnic to be on welfare.''   ``There are strict eligibility requirements for all welfare,''Ms. Regunberg said. ``Someone can't just walk in off the street andget welfare. And what we're talking about here, by and large, ischildren. Two-thirds of people on welfare are children.''   ``The mayor would have us believe healthy males can walk in andget relief.''   Ms. Lybarger said she has been a legal aid lawyer specializingin government benefits cases since 1972 and never heard of a policyas sweeping as Sullivan's.   ``There are probably people making enough money from drugs thatthey are not eligible for welfare, and they should be investigated.This policy has taken much too broad a sweep at this problem,'' Ms.Lybarger said.</TEXT></DOC>
