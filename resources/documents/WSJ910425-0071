Under the agreement, Schering-Plough, a pharmaceutical andhealth care concern, will pay $6.5 million to Agouron, a LaJolla, Calif., drug-design technology concern. In return,Schering will receive a nonexclusive license to use certainAgouron drug-design technology.</LP><TEXT>   The two concerns intend to try to develop a new class ofanti-cancer drugs that attack a human protein produced by agene called RAS. Mutant forms of the protein are found invarious types of cancerous growths. Agouron's method of drugdiscovery, called rational drug design, uses computerizedmodels of protein molecules to synthesize drugs based onthose molecular structures. Drug and biotechnology companiesare pursuing development of such drugs, although no such drugyet exists.</TEXT></DOC>
