He hadn't heard from Lawrence Walsh in more thanthree years, not so much as a threatening phone call. Therewas no new evidence of any wrongdoing from his 1986congressional testimony on aid to the Contras.   Jeffrey Toobin, Mr. Walsh's former assistant whose job wasto investigate Mr. Abrams, had concluded there was no case.&quot;I had to concede that, as of the summer of 1987, theevidence against Abrams fell short of that necessary to bringa criminal case,&quot; Mr. Toobin wrote in his Iran-Contra book.&quot;I took pride in knowing that exercising restraint inprosecution often takes as much courage as bringing cases.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Sometimes restraint takes too much courage. On Sept. 16,Mr. Walsh sent one of his aides to inform Mr. Abrams's lawyerthat &quot;there is movement&quot; in the prosecution. Mr. Abrams istoo polite to say so, but this was the very day federalappeals court judges dismissed Mr. Walsh's case againstOliver North. John Poindexter's conviction was also destinedto collapse, as it did last week. Mr. Walsh needed a scalp tokeep his multimillion-dollar operation going. Mr. Abrams'swould do.   Federal Judge Aubrey Robinson Jr. gave the best measure ofthe seriousness of Mr. Abrams's offense last week when hedevised an unusual punishment. Instead of a jail sentence,Judge Robinson sentenced Mr. Abrams to 100 hours lecturingother lawyers on legal ethics. A federal judge does not givea legal-ethics assignment to a defendant whose legal ethicshe doubts. The $50 fine was the minimum -- and is dwarfed byMr. Abrams's legal bills.   Mr. Abrams took time off from a book he's writing abouthis prosecution to reflect on how his decade as an assistantsecretary of state led to a plea bargain. He refers to whathe calls the Office of Selective Prosecutor. It's easy to seewhy.   His &quot;crime&quot; was not being entirely frank during acongressional hearing, which is hardly unprecedented, and notjust for executive-branch officials. Asked if a congressmenever lied to him, Mr. Abrams replied yes, of course. So hadcongressional staffers, who Mr. Abrams said routinely leakedinformation from confidential briefings on Nicaragua.   Still, Special Prosecutor Walsh prosecuted. &quot;The problemis institutional, not personal,&quot; Mr. Abrams said. &quot;People donot leave their families at home and come to Washington sothat they can brag about the level of restraint they showedas special prosecutors. No one wants to go home after severalyears with an empty scrapbook, so there is every incentive toprosecute.&quot;   What crime did Mr. Abrams commit? He told a congressionalcommittee that &quot;the attitude of the administration is that&quot;the Contras &quot;are doing a very good thing&quot; in opposing theSandinistas, but that &quot;we have been kind of careful not toget closely involved with it.&quot; Mr. Walsh insisted thediplomatically phrased answer criminally misled Congress. Mr.Abrams was also asked &quot;if any foreign government is helpingto supply the Contras.&quot; He said no, which was strictly truebecause the sultan of Brunei's contribution hadn't reachedthe Contras (and never did).   At least until this misdemeanor plea, &quot;It was clear thatthere was very wide latitude in political discourse,&quot; Mr.Abrams said. &quot;I didn't think my testimony went beyond theparameters when I gave it.&quot; He noted that Carteradministration officials failed to tell Congress about ManuelNoriega's dealings when they argued for the Panama CanalTreaty. In his memoirs, McGeorge Bundy praised RobertMcNamara's &quot;most justified deception&quot; when he told Congressthat President Kennedy didn't cut a deal with the Soviets toget them to withdraw missiles from Cuba.   There is a long history of congressmen who preferignorance, which helps them maintain deniability. Mr. Walshhas made it a crime to not tell Congress what it didn't wantto hear.   In fact, this case is a precedent only for selectivelyprosecuting someone who has as many enemies as Mr. Abramsearned in his political battles. &quot;The special prosecutor'snew rules did not apply before me and may not applyafterward,&quot; Mr. Abrams said. &quot;I think you'd advise a witnessthat historical political standards probably apply, but ifyou get the Democrats really mad, a higher standard willapply and you'd better meet it.&quot;   Mr. Abrams gave this example: A congressional committeeasks, Have you made a decision on how much foreign aid shouldgo to Turkey? &quot;Now to ask the question is to evoke a smile,&quot;Mr. Abrams said. &quot;There are informal, unwritten decisions,but it's understood that the question will not lead to thekind of answer one might give in a courtroom. If courtroomstandards now apply, we should announce the change, apply itequally to all witnesses and to congressmen.&quot; Of course,hairsplitting legalistic answers is no way to help Congressgather information.   The special problem is special prosecutors who answer toCongress and not to experienced law-enforcement officials.&quot;There is no supervision and no continuity,&quot; Mr. Abrams said.&quot;From my case, is there any principle of law, any rule oflaw? No, only that politics determines whether there is aprosecution.&quot;   Even special prosecutors would be easier to bear if formergovernment officials of usual means could afford to defendthemselves from budgetless attacks. A trial would have costMr. Abrams at least $1 million in legal costs if he hadn'tplea bargained. John Poindexter faces legal bills of morethan $3 million and Joseph Fernandez owes lawyers $2 millionfor prosecutions that Mr. Walsh was forced to drop and nevershould have brought.   Mr. Abrams has a suggestion. The Constitution includes theSpeech and Debate Clause, which prohibits criminal casesagainst legislators for what they say on the floor ofCongress. &quot;This was because kings of England used the courtsto silence Parliament. We decided to include a constitutionalprohibition on the executive branch's using its prosecutorialpower politically against Congress,&quot; Mr. Abrams said. Nowthat we have the congressional creation of a specialprosecutor to go after presidential aides, &quot;maybe we need aSpeech and Debate Clause protection for executive-branchofficials.&quot;   Mr. Abrams, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute inWashington, has a book about the oscillations betweeninterventionism and isolationism in U.S. foreign policy,&quot;Shield and Sword,&quot; coming out in the spring. He plans tocall his next book, on his legal troubles, either &quot;PleadingGuilty&quot; or &quot;Trial by Ordeal.&quot;   Unless President Bush refuses to reauthorize thespecial-prosecutor law, there will be more Elliott Abramses.So long as special prosecutors are on the prowl, anyone whothinks of coming to work in Washington needs to understandthe full risks of government service.
