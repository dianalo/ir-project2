Two helicopters landed at the compound about 7:30 a.m. and athird hovered overhead, apparently providing cover, while the 30Americans were evacuated, a witness said.   It is the first time an American ambassador has been pulled fromLebanon since the sectarian civil war began 14 years ago, and themove at least temporarily ended the American diplomatic presence inthe country.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler angrily blamed theChristian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, for the move, saying hethreatened to expose U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy and his staff toa ``good dose of Christian terrorism.''   She said that before the evacuation, an unidentified telephonecaller had threatened to shoot down the U.S. helicopter that broughtsupplies to the embassy and that an unidentified protest leader saidpeople in the embassy entered and left ``at their own risk.''   The Americans will return when ``conditions permit,'' Ms.Tutwiler said.   On arrival at the U.S. military's Rhine-Main Air Base outsideFrankfurt, a weary McCarthy told reporters Wednesday night that ``assoon as those questions of security and safety can be resolved ...it would be important for us to resume the work that we were doingin Beirut.''   McCarthy and his staff flew in on a U.S. Air Force C-130transport plane from Cyprus. They are expected to leave West Germanyfor the United States on Thursday but no further details wereimmediately available.   ``It just seemed to me that in the last several days it was nolonger possible for me to guarantee to Washington that the safety ofmy staff was secure and it was for that reason that we left,''McCarthy said.   ``But as soon as those questions of security and safety can beresolved, it seems to be that it would be important for us to resumethe work that we were doing in Beirut.''   In Christian east Beirut, youths who had blockaded the gates ofthe embassy compound for 24 hours dispersed at 1 p.m.   The Movement for Supporting Liberation threatened in a statementto resume the embassy siege if McCarthy returned before Washingtonrecognized Aoun's Christian Cabinet as the ``legitimate Lebanesegovernment.''   Aoun, who has fought an artillery war with Syrian troops sixmonths, said of the evacuation: ``It seems the American Caincouldn't endure the stare of the Lebanese Abel, so he left.''   Aoun accuses the United States of supporting the presence of40,000 soldiers in Lebanon, which he calls an occupation army. TheSyrians are in the country under a 1976 Arab League peacekeepingmandate.   Syrians and Christians exchanged intermittent artillery fire inand around Beirut on Wednesday, killing one person and woundingthree.   By police count, 828 people have been killed and 2,455 woundedsince the fighting began March 8 between the 20,000 men of Aoun'sChristian army units and a Moslem alliance led by the Syrians.   McCarthy arrived a year ago, but to avoid extending recognitionto either Aoun's government or the competing Moslem Cabinet ofacting Premier Salim Hoss, he did not present his credentials.   In Aoun's statement, issued in English, the U.S.-trained generalsaid: ``I am not surprised at all by the apparently precipitatedeparture of our American guests early this morning.   ``I used the term `guests' since, as the American ambassador didnot see fit to present his credentials to my government, his statusand that of his officials was, strictly speaking, that of visitors.   ``Such puzzling and petulant behavior by Mr. McCarthy merelyreflects the nature and conduct of the U.S. State Department'spolicy toward that part of Lebanon free of Syrian occupation.''   An-Nahar, an independent Beirut newspaper, said an undisclosednumber of American diplomats left Beirut on Saturday after Aoun tolda news conference the United States had ``sold Lebanon to Syria.''   He claimed U.S. policy was ``dictated exclusively by concernsover the eight remaining American hostages in Lebanon.''   The eight are among 16 Western captives, most believed to be inthe hands of Shiite radicals loyal to Iran. Held longest is Terry A.Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,kidnapped March 16, 1985.   A resident of Aoukar, the Christian suburb where the embassy islocated, said: ``Two helicopters landed at the embassy compoundaround 7:30 a.m. while the third, which appeared to be armed withmachine guns, hovered overhead at a medium altitude in an apparentprotection mission.   ``Several people boarded the helicopters seconds after theylanded. They also loaded big sacks and several bags on the aircraft,which took off a few minutes later.''   Keith Peterson, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus, said:``This move was in response to deteriorating local circumstanceswhich no longer permitted the embassy to function effectively. TheUnited States is not abandoning Lebanon. ... its personnel willreturn when the situation permits.''   American diplomats moved to the Beirut facility, an embassyannex, after a Shiite Moslem suicide bomber rammed a van packed withexplosives into the seaside embassy in Moslem west Beirut on April19, 1983, killing 17 Americans and 46 other people.   A suicide bomber attacked the east Beirut annex on Sept. 20,1984, killing 12 people and wounding 96, but the embassy remainedthere.</TEXT></DOC>
