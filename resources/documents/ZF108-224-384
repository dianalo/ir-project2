 And although their productivitybenefits have not always been as high as originally predicted, many 4GL usersare finding a considerable saving in development time and costs.andM;Many 4GLs have been around since the mid-'80s, but it is only in the past twoto three years that they have received widespread acceptance.andM;&quot;The early 4GLs were designed with very specific purposes in mind -- eitherproducing a particular kind of financial report or some such thing as that,&quot;says John Kornatowski, president of Toronto-based Empress Software Inc.andO;&quot;Just getting them to solve data processing applications was a real problem.&quot;andM;Since that time, however, 4GL use has grown in sophistication to the pointwhere 4GL vendors are now able to address a wide variety of markets as wellas specific needs with their products.andM;Empress Software, a developer of 4GL tools for Unix-based systems, last yearintroduced version 4.0 of Empress, a 4GL package allowing the management andstorage of data in object-oriented forms, including graphics, fingerprints,charts and voices.andP;  Not content to rest on the laurels of currentapplications, Kornatowski says user demand has prompted another version ofEmpress to be adapted for use with X-windows.andM;The increase in acceptance of 4GLs of late has been dramatic, suggests ChadCarpenter, senior vice-president, sales and services of Bedford, Mass.-basedProgress Software Corp.andP;  &quot;When we first started the company, a lot of thesale was convincing people to use a 4GL -- now you rarely have to do that.&quot;andO;Carpenter attributes the slow acceptance of 4GLs in the early days to theirlack of flexibility.andP;  &quot;Whenever you go to the next level of abstraction inlanguages, there's potentially some set of capabilities that you lose.andM;&quot;The challenge of building a good 4GL is ...andP;  to give people the power of thelanguage without constraining them in ways so that they can't get them done(which) we call 'hitting the wall'.&quot;andM;Progress, the company's 4GL and relational database management system(RDBMS), now in its fifth version, is designed to run on a wide range ofhardware platforms, including Vax clusters.andP;  &quot;Whenever we've had to maketrade-offs between ease of use and functionality, we've always come down onthe side of functionality,&quot; Carpenter says.andP;  &quot;You can do simple things withour product, but if all you want to do is simple things, there are otherproducts that can just as well do the job.&quot;andM;Advances in 4GL design, Carpenter says, have reduced considerably the numberof programmers who demand a third generation language solution.andP;  &quot;There aresome applications that you have to do in Cobol or C, but for those who coulddo it in either but prefer Cobol -- we're seeing much, much less of that.&quot;andM;Currently, the company is in the process of dividing the language from thedatabase so that the Progress 4GL can be used by customers who prefer otherdatabases, such as Oracle.andM;When 4GLs first began to gain popularity, extravagant claims were made fortheir ability to increase productivity.andP;  Since then, those boasts have beenscaled down somewhat.andP;  &quot;There are some people who have said that you get fouror five to one productivity gains using fourth generation languages,&quot; saysMike Braude, researcher with the Gartner Group, based in Stamford, Conn.andP;  &quot;Wereally don't think so -- we think it's 30 to 40 per cent.&quot;andM;Jose de la Torre, technical director -- 4GLs, relational databases andcomputer-aided software engineering (CASE) technology at Oakbrook, Ill.-basedApplied Information Development Inc. concurs.andP;  &quot;A lot of people imagine thattheir development time gets cut down anywhere from one-half to three-quartersof development time -- that's not necessarily true.&quot;andM;De la Torre blames the learning curve for preventing 4GLs from living up totheir full expectations.andP;  &quot;It's always been longer than what people believeit will be -- exactly how long depends on the tool and how it's going to beused in the organization,&quot; says de la Torre.andP;  &quot;Also, I think people forgetabout the fact that a lot of these tools only help in some of the phases ofthe life cycle -- not all of the phases of the life cycle.&quot;andM;The requirements phase, for example, is not helped by 4GLs, de la Torre says.andO;&quot;There are design-type tools such as Excelerator (from Index TechnologyCorp.) that help with that phase, but most of these 4GLs help in thedevelopment phase of the project and that's where quite a bit of savings arefound.&quot;andM;In spite of the curbed expectations of 4GLs, some management informationsystems (MIS) departments have enjoyed dramatic reductions in developmenttime through their use.andP;  One such department is in the Hudson's Bay Co. inToronto.andM;Less timeandM;The department used the SAS 4GL from the SAS Institute of Cary, N.C.andP;  todevelop a management reporting system for internal use.andP;  &quot;We did it in acouple of man-months,&quot; says senior technical planner Mike Wharrie.andP;  &quot;With a3GL it would have taken at least a year with a full-blown development team onit -- the bottom line is, we saved over half a million dollars on thedevelopment.&quot;andM;But reducing development cost is not the only reason users give for choosinga 4GL.andP;  Bruce Ratford, director of administration for the Management ServicesDepartment of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, says he chose theProgress 4GL because it allowed him to create &quot;fairly robust applicationswithout having to build in a lot of code or a lot of utilities.&quot;andM;Some users are augmenting their 4GL capability by using software that createsa natural language interface with the user.andP;  Intelligent Business Systems ofMilford, Conn.andP;  offers a program, EasyTalk, which takes the structured querylanguage (SQL) normally associated with 4GLs and translates it into standardenglish.andM;As 4GLs enter the '90s, the trend is to have them interface with otherproductivity tools to cover the whole development life cycle.andP;  &quot;Mostcompanies are realizing that there is not any one tool to solve theirproblem,&quot; says de la Torre.andP;  &quot;For example, front-end CASE tools likeExcelerator address the design portion of it, products such as APS or Telonaddress Cobol generation, and then tools like CICS Playback for testing.andP;  Ithink that more companies are starting to realize that if they want toaddress the entire development life cycle, they are really in need of five orsix 4GL CASE-type tools.&quot;andM;Craig Hubbard is a freelance writer based in Toronto.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
