While consumers can use the loans to finance new vehicle purchases, GM said the loans won't be available through new-car dealerships, although it isn't ruling out such a possibility in the future.    The program is the first home-equity venture for the auto maker, which currently offers home mortgages, car and boat financing and other financial services through its General Motors Acceptance Corp. subsidiary.    The company said consumers in Illinois, Maryland and Michigan &quot;who have an established relationship&quot; with GMAC will be included in the program, which provides &quot;an alternative to traditional financing&quot; for major purchases such as a new vehicle or for education, home improvement or medical expenses.    Using home-equity loans to finance such expenditures has become more popular since the 1986 tax bill began phasing out deductibility of all consumer-loan interest payments except those on certain types of home-equity loans. GM said its new program should appeal to customers who are &quot;increasingly interested in programs that offer tax advantages.&quot;    GM is offering its new program through the GMAC Mortgage Corp. of Pennsylvania subsidiary. The program provides a 15-year-term line of credit starting at $10,000. The maximum amount depends on the accrued equity and value of the applicant's home.    The program is &quot;good strategy&quot; for GM, according to William R. King Jr., a financial-services industry analyst with McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei Inc. in New York. Offering customers of one subsidiary a service from another &quot;allows GM to try to make money with a client base they know.&quot; Many financial-services companies use this so-called cross-marketing technique to attract new customers and to encourage existing customers to buy new products.    Mr. King said GM has priced its loans &quot;right in the thick of the competition&quot; with base finance charges ranging from 1.5 to two percentage points over the prevailing bank prime rate, depending on account usage.    GM said there aren't any restrictions on the use of funds, which can be withdrawn by check in minimum increments of $250.    A spokesman for Chrysler Corp. said its financial subsidiary is testing a home-equity loan program similar to GM's, but he declined to provide details. </TEXT></DOC>
