The 21st anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion is Monday. Theoccasion has brought many appeals, including from Warsaw Pactneighbors, to rewrite the emotional chapter in Czechoslovak history.   The party leadership, however, refused to alter the official viewthat the invasion was a good thing.   ``There are various attempts at home and abroad at would-bereassessment of the events of the time,'' said a Communist PartyPresidium statement carried by the official CTK news agency.   ``The period of social crisis in 1968-69 and events connectedwith this period have been thoroughly assessed and evaluated, usingall accessible documents by the 14th Congress of the Communist Partyin 1971,'' the statement said.   That congress condemned the ``Prague Spring'' reforms and gaveformal approval to the armed intervention.   The anniversary of the invasion has highlighted the divisions inthe East bloc, where some nations are experimenting with more openeconomies and cultures and others are adhering to strict socialism.   The lower house of the Polish National Assembly on Thursdayadopted a resolution asserting that the invasion ``violated everynation's ... natural desire for democracy, freedom and respect ofhuman rights.'' The upper house criticized the invasion last week.   Hungarian Communists issued a statement Tuesday saying theydisagreed with the invasion and urged the Prague leadership toreassess the events.   But the invasion has been defended by East Germany, which hasrejected the sort of democratic reforms undertaken by Poland andHungary. East Germany and Czechoslovakia are among the mosthard-line Soviet bloc countries.   The intervention ``proved to be the only effective way out,'' NewGermany, the East German Communist Party daily, said Friday.   CTK said the Presidium agreed that the Hungarian statement``objectively helps forces which act against socialism inCzechoslovakia.''   The Czechoslovak government again served notice Thursday that itwould crack down on all public demonstrations attempting tocommemorate the anniversary.   Czechoslovak human rights groups and prominent activists haveasked there be no street protests, citing fears of a harsh responseby the authorities.   The 1968 invasion crushed the short-lived liberalization periodspearheaded by then-Communist Party leader Alexander Dubcek.   Except for Romania, the invasion included all of Czechoslovakia'sWarsaw Pact allies: the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, East Germany,Hungary and Poland.</TEXT></DOC>
