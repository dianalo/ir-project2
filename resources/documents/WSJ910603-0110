Under the five-year agreement, DOE will provide $64million and Westinghouse, working with other companies andutilities, will provide the remaining $76 million to developan affordable alternative to internal combustion andturbine-based energy sources.</LP><TEXT>   Westinghouse describes its fuel cell, a less than one-inchdiameter ceramic tube, as a nonpolluting, energy-efficientand quiet source of energy, particularly for small commercialand industrial plants.   The Westinghouse fuel cell is a solid-state device -- noliquids -- that, operating similarly to a continuous battery,converts energy from fossil fuels directly into electricity.</TEXT></DOC>
