A bomb destroyed an opposition union's offices and injured twopeople, and a union leader said leaflets found at the scene claimedclaimed responsibility for a right-wing death squad.   Also Wednesday, guerrillas accused the army of attacking a rebelfield hospital on Monday, killing three patients, two nurses and adoctor. The army denied the charge but said it killed eightguerrillas in combat in the same area.   Despite the parties' willingness to talk with the rebels, thegovernment, armed forces and the right-wing party leading in pollsfor the upcoming vote have virtually ruled out any postponement ofthe vote.   ``The main parties don't really want to talk with the (rebels).But no one wants to be the one to give the definitive `No,''' saidMario Aguinada of the leftist Democratic Nationalist Union.   Aguinada spoke to journalists after the announcement thatrepresentatives of El Salvador's 13 parties were willing to meetwith a delegation of the guerrilla command next week in Mexico,Guatemala or Costa Rica.   The parties left site selection up to the rebels.   The insurgents said previously they would come to San Salvador totalk, but it was not known if they would be willing to take partoutside the country.   The parties, in a communique, suggested the meeting take placeMonday.   Rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN,proposed last month that the presidential election scheduled forMarch 19 be postponed until September.   The guerrillas said they would respect the outcome of the vote ifit were put off and security and anti-fraud conditions were met.They had rejected as a ``farce'' the previous five nationalelections this decade.   The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, isfavored to win the March election. It is staunchly against anypostponement, which would have to be approved unanimously by allparties.   The bomb that ripped apart an opposition union's offices onWednesday also damaged six nearby homes.   Humberto Centeno, a leader in the National Union of SalvadoranWorkers, said the self-proclaimed Maximiliano Hernandez MartinezFront claimed responsibility for Wednesday's blast in leaflets leftat the site.   The leaflet warned that the group would ``not rest until itexterminates communists ... and those groups and people who help theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front.''   When U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle was in El Salvador earlierthis month, he complained about the re-emergence of death squads.   The new group takes its name from Hernandez Martinez, aconservative Salvadoran president from 1932-44.   The rebel Radio Venceremos said troops of the elite Atlacatlbattalion attacked the field hospital Monday. It said the threewomen killed _ two nurses and a Mexican doctor _ also were raped.   But Col. Galileo Torres told The Associated Press in a telephoneinterview, `There was no hospital there.'' He said Atlacatl troopskilled eight guerrillas in an ambush, and recovered a radio, severalrifles and explosives from the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
