The opening show of the five-day fashion parade, Dolce andGabbana, looked more a scene from a red-light district than arunway.   Sequined bras, bandanas and bustiers, black thigh stockings,ultra-short skirts and shorts, long strings of pearls and goldbeads all combined to make the streetwalker a fashion plate.   The two Sicilians Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana make nobones about their body baring. ``Passion is what the collection isall about,'' boast the two young and emerging designers.   ``What we did was undress the body, to emphasize the best pointsof the Mediterranean beauty, breasts, waist and hips.''   The designers, however, were careful not to make the look tooaggressive, interspersing black negligee wear with ethereal whitechiffon tunics and demure poof skirts. White thigh stockings andopera sleeves combined to place the Dolce and Gabbana womansomewhere between the ballet school and the brothel.   In any case there is no place for her in the office. A series ofwhite pant suits with ultra high waists and long duster jacketswere the only acceptable office apparel in the entire show.   Giorgio Armani, the most popular Italian ready-to-wear designer,who made his fame by making the mannish look fashionable, alsosuccumbs to passion for the Spring-Summer 1991.   In his Emporio collection, for the younger set, shown hereSunday, he emphasizes long legs in thigh-high mini skirts andthigh-baring shorts, both worn with high-heeled sandals.   But the Armani sex appeal is less blatant than the flamboyantDolce and Gabbana look, with lots of youthful and sportywindbreakers for day and night to soften the message.   Complice, who also showed Sunday, opted for a more citified lookin neat pant suits, trim skirts and classic jackets. However brasare not a big item in the Complice collection, with bare breastsunder almost every blouse and jacket seen down the runway.   Even staid and demure Laura Biagiotti could not resist thetemptations of the flesh, baring the body in her new collectionpresented Sunday, with silk thread faggoting on long linen eveninggowns in ivory white.   Thus the Biagiotti women, used to hiding her figure in ample``bambola'' doll dresses, finds herself showing off her navel, hipsand thighs.   Gianni Versace, whose sexy styles make him the golden boy ofRodeo Drive, was also to present his version of the 1991 Italiansex appeal. If other designers are predicting a hot summer,Gianni's is sure to be torrid.</TEXT></DOC>
