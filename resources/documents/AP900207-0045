(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Relatives say they listened helplessly toscreams for help but were kept back by intense heat as a youngcouple and four children died in a fire that destroyed their mobilehome.   A woodburning stove that had been moved and reinstalled in themobile home just a day earlier caused the fire.   Killed in Tueday's predawn fire were Davie Light, 18; MichelleMiller, 22; their 3-week-old daughter, Jessica; Miller's two otherchildren, James, 3, and Alicia, 16 months; and Light's niece,Rachel Hafley, 3.   ``I ran over and I could hear Davie yelling and banging, tryingto get out,'' said Jim Wills, Light's brother-in-law. ``I tried toyank the back door open, but when I finally did, it was too late.''   The flames blocked the door, he said, trapping the occupants.   ``It's an awful thing when you hear someone hollering forhelp,'' Wills said, ``and you can't do nothing.''   Investigators said the fire started in an improperly installedflue attached to the wood stove.   ``Apparently the flue pipe was a couple of inches too shortwhere it ran through the ceiling,'' said Washington County SheriffRonnie L. Skiles. ``The stove had also been mounted on woodenblocks.''   Robert Jacobsen, of the state division of fire safety, said thefire probably had smoldered for some time before bursting intoflames and that the residents probably could have gotten out hadthe trailer been equipped with a smoke detector.   Skiles said wood stoves were becoming more prevalent in trailersin the area, 65 miles southwest of St. Louis.   ``People can't afford gas, they can't afford electricity,especially in a financially depressed area like Washington County.They do it to save money,'' he said.   Skiles said although fire codes don't forbid it, ``a mobile homeis not made for a wood stove.''</TEXT></DOC>
