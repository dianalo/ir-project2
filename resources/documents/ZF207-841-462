 What a zoo!andP;  If you also have to keep track of every bit ofinformation, (i.e.andP;  x-rays, blood tests, anesthetics, and medical andsurgical histories), you have a major undertaking at hand.andM;Now, consider how this problem expands with patients of differentspecies--like at the National Zoo.andP;  Imagine a system for managing medicalrecords that's also a patient inventory system.andP;  Each gazelle, rhino,peacock, or what-have-you, is uniquely identified, so that all of its medicaldata can be correlated for its benefit as well as the benefit of others ofits species.andP;  Patient locations (pens, cages, etc.) are also maintained.andM;These are just some of the considerations Michael Mazan had to take intoaccount when he and his staff at GPC systems developed a multiuser medicalrecords management system for the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.andP;  Mazan hadworked with the zoo veterinarians, and the familiarity helped in thedevelopment of the system.andM;At the outset of this project, the zoo was using a single-user BASIC programon a Tandy computer.andP;  This single-user system just couldn't keep up.andP;  It wasslow, and the file capacity was limited.andP;  Multiuser data entry and preservingthe past eight years of records was essential.andM;Mazan and GPC systems specializes in filePro applications.andP;  &quot;A key advantageto file Pro 16 Plus [the current version of the software] is that it can growwith the application.andP;  We can start a small customer on a DOS single-userversion of filePro 16 and upgrade the application all the way to multiuserXENIX without losing data acquired along the way,&quot; said Mazan.andP;  &quot;Even thecode can be transferred to the new system.&quot;andM;filePRO 16 Plus was also chosen as the database management program because ofits multiuser support--it handles all the record locking completelyautomatically.andP;  The developers wrote the application with the filePro editorin the filePro 16 Plus environment.andP;  This development environment, availableonly with the &quot;Plus&quot; version, includes a debugger, customized help screens,precompiled processing tables for increased speed, and more.andP;  The developmentteam chose SCO XENIX and a WYSE 386 as the operating system and CPU ofchoice.andP;  They didn't consider DOS because they needed multiuser support thatwould have required the added expense of a LAN and multiple computeracquisitions.andP;  With XENIX, only dumb terminals (WYSE 60) are necessary formultiuser input/access.andP;  The application allowed the zoo to continue usingits old hardware as terminals; the 386 runs the whole system.andM;To retain the records already on file, the team linked the Tandy machine andthe 386 via RS-232 ports.andP;  They used the fp transfer utility (also availablefrom The Small Computer Company) to convert files from non-ASCII format onthe Tandy to ASCII on the 386 running XENIX.andP;  fp transfer comes in twoflavors, DOS and UNIX.andP;  Run on their respective machines, the modules controlserial port file transfers.andP;  The developers edited and cleaned up the filesusing standard UNIX utilities SED and AWK.andM;For the zoo system, all animals are identified by their unique accessionnumber.andP;  Analogous to a social security number, this number is used as partof a key segment or header of the data table.andP;  Medical &quot;incidents,&quot; such asvenipuncture, medication, x-rays, etc., are associated with the animal'saccession number via coded lists of standard procedures and entered into thesystem.andP;  Zoo personnel can see individual medical records for each animal.andO;Although these may consist of one incident or many separate incidents, theoverall file structures and relations are transparent to the users.andM;Up to now, the data has centered on reviewing patient data and following upon anesthetic administrations.andP;  Finding the right amount of the rightanesthetic for a given species remains an empiric art.andP;  By cataloging theirexperience, zoo veterinarians enhance the likelihood of providing adequatebut not excessive anesthesia for their patients.andM;The developers encountered no problems while creating the zoo medical recordsmanager with the latest version of filePro 16, although they did haveproblems with earlier versions on other projects.andP;  Developing the medicalrecords manager wasn't implemented sooner due to software limitations.andP;  Forexample, earlier versions could only accommodate two automatic indexes,whereas Plus can handle up to eight.andP;  This was an important consideration,considering the database had over 80,000 records; users wanted instant accessto information.andP;  Likewise, older version of the product didn't offer thenewer version's enhanced screen and report capabilities, like color, boxdrawing, or block operations.andM;Mazan said some clients are troubled by the higher initial expense of filePro16 Plus versus other systems.andP;  filePro 16 Plus is also not as well known asdBASE, and some clients resist it for that reason.andP;  However, Mazan believesin developing a relationship with his clients that promotes faith in GPCSystems and their recommendations.andP;  Rapid development time, multiuser power,multi-operating system compatibility, and client satisfaction are featuresMazan cites to support his decision to use filePro 16 Plus.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
