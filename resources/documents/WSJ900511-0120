At the same time, the major British pharmaceutical makersaid it will accelerate development of Wellferon, its form ofthe drug interferon, by expanding production and seekingwider approval for the medicine's use in treating hepatitis.Some analysts praised Wellcome's strategic shift, noting thatinterferon has greater long-term sales potential than TPAmight have had in a market already clogged with competitors.</LP><TEXT>   Wellcome said it decided to discontinue development of TPAafter losing a U.S. patent infringement suit brought byGenentech, a South San Francisco company that has agreed to amerger plan that would give a majority stake to Roche HoldingLtd. of Switzerland. Last month, a federal district courtjury in Delaware found that Wellcome and Genetics InstituteInc., its U.S. collaborator, had infringed on three Genentechpatents by trying to develop forms of TPA. Wellcomepreviously had won a U.K. patent case involving the drug,used during heart attacks to restore blood flow and thuslimit damage.   The prospect of a protracted U.S. appeal made it&quot;difficult if not impossible to say what the (drug's) marketpotential would be in the United States,&quot; where Wellcome hadsought initial marketing approval in March, said MartinSherwood, a Wellcome spokesman. He said the company hadinvested &quot;a substantial sum of money&quot; in developing TPA --analysts estimated as much as $80 million -- but the legaltangle &quot;put us into a high-risk area.&quot; He added: &quot;There's nodoubt that (the withdrawal) is a disappointment to us.&quot;   Wellcome also cited recent studies &quot;suggesting that TPAdoes not have a markedly superior therapeutic profile to theestablished product streptokinase.&quot; A study released in Marchconcluded that Hoechst AG's streptokinase prolongs life aswell as Genentech's flagship TPA product, sold under thebrand name Activase, even though it costs only aboutone-tenth as much as TPA. Genentech criticized the study, thefirst head-to-head comparison between the two drugs, asconfusing and inconclusive.   Wellcome's decision will sharpen the fierce competitionbetween Genentech's Activase and Eminase, a recently approveddrug made by SmithKline Beecham PLC of Britain. Genentech,whose TPA sales last year rose 30% to $196.4 million, holdsabout two-thirds of the market, but SmithKline Beecham ismarketing Eminase aggressively.   Wellcome's withdrawal &quot;will benefit both (Genentech andSmithKline Beecham) because there will be that much lesscompetition&quot; in sight, said Erling Refsum, apharmaceutical-industry analyst at Nomura Research Institutein London. A SmithKline Beecham spokesman declined to commenton the Wellcome action.   Wellcome's abandonment of TPA also may convince other drugcompanies also to relinquish development of their versions,Mr. Refsum said. &quot;It will restrict the development of furtherTPAs but enhance the development of other bio-technologydrugs&quot; because Genentech's court victory demonstrated thesemedicines' patents may withstand legal challenges.   In South San Francisco, the attorney who defendedGenentech's TPA patent position said that Wellcome'swithdrawal from the field prolongs the biotechnology firm'seffective monopoly and discourages future competition.   &quot;With Wellcome stepping out of the picture, it will leaveGenentech alone in the marketplace for a much longer period,&quot;said Stephen Raines, Genentech's vice president ofintellectual property. More importantly, he said, &quot;The secondgeneration product was also dropped. That could certainlyhave a chilling effect on other companies looking at secondgeneration products, if they feel that, after all theirinvestment, that product could be found to be infringing onGenentech's patent.&quot;   Wellcome's U.S. collaborator, Genetics Institute,Cambridge, Mass., said it is seeking to overturn the patentverdict, but that a ruling on the matter isn't expectedbefore September. The biotechnology concern said it hasn'tdecided whether to continue developing its clot-dissolvingdrugs. It said its agreement with Suntory Ltd. of Japan,which has licensed rights to a related drug in Asia, remainsinplace.   Genetics Institute said it expects its 1990 revenue to becut by up to $5 million because of Wellcome's decision. For1989, Genetics Institute had a net loss of $28.7 million, or$2.11 a share, on revenue of $43.6 million.   Mr. Refsum and other analysts said Wellcome was smart toswitch research emphasis on genetically engineered drugs fromTPA to Wellferon, which mainly has been marketed for minorindications such as hairy cell leukemia. The interferonappears useful in treating hepatitis B, the viral infection'smost serious form. It is &quot;one of their major products inRandamp;D,&quot; said Andrew Porter, a London analyst for NikkoSecurities Co. But unlike Wellcome's leading AIDS drug, AZT,he said, &quot;Wellferon will be a useful but not spectacularcontributor to Wellcome.&quot;   Wellcome's Mr. Sherwood said Italy recently clearedWellferon for use in treating hepatitis B and &quot;initialindications are that sales are going to be good there.&quot;Within a few months, Wellcome expects to gain marketingclearance in Spain and Southeast Asia. He said the companyviews those areas &quot;as large potential markets&quot; becausehepatitis is so widespread there.</TEXT></DOC>
