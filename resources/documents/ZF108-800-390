Should I buy a backup program?andM;Hans SpielbergerandM;Getzville, New YorkandM;With dual hard disks, DOS's XCOPY command will work as effectively, if notquite as quickly or as fancily, as any backup program.andM;If C: is your primary drive and D: your backup drive, the command XCOPYC:\*.* D:\ /S /E will copy everything from C: to D:, subdirectories and all.andO;(The /S tells XCOPY to include subdirectories, and /E includes even thosethat are empty.) Now, XCOPY C:\,*,* D:\ /S /M will perform an incrementalbackup.andP;  The /M tells XCOPY to copy only files whose archive bits are set toidentify any file that has been modified since it was last backed up.andM;Use More Hard DrivesandM;How con I expand the list of supported hard drives in an AT or XT clone?andM;Doris KochisandM;Rye Brook, New YorkandM;In one of two ways: with a BIOS upgrade, or with a specialized hard diskinstallation utility such as Ontrack Computer Systems' Disk Manager orStorage Dimensions' SpeedStor.andM;Most clones sport a BIOS by Phoenix, AMI or Award.andP;  If you upgrade your BIOS,you'll need to know which brand you have.andP;  The brand name and version numberusually appear on the screen at startup.andP;  If they don't, remove your PC'scover and look at the label on the chip itself.andP;  Then contact themanufacturer for information on upgrades and drive types supported by laterversions of its BIOSes.andM;It's useful to know the version number or revision date of the BIOS in yourmachine when you contact a BIOS vendor.andP;  If the version number isn'tapparent, you can get the revision date with DEBUG.andP;  Start DEBUG and type:andM;D F:FFF5andM;You should see a date in the form MM/ DD/YY displayed in the right-handmargin of the screen.andP;  On Compaq PCs, substitute FFF6 for FFF5 to account fora one-byte discrepancy in the ROM location of the revision date.andM;With Disk Manager or SpeedStor, you have the added option of supportingotherwise unsupported drive types through software.andP;  Disk Manager, whichretails for $124.95, comes in two flavors: one for XT- and AT-type PCs andone for Micro Channel PCs.andP;  Disk Manager supports a long list of third-partydrives and also lets you set up multiple DOS partitions (up to nearly Igigabyte in length) and perform high-and low-level formats.andP;  SpeedStor offerssimilar capabilities for a list price of $99.95.andP;  Ontrack can be reached at(612) 937-1107 in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, Storage Dimensions at (408)879-0300 in San Jose, California.andM;Tricky Carriage ReturnandM;I know how to trick a batch file into thinking Y or N has been pressed whenit asks for a yes-or-no response by using andless; to direct the batch to a filethat contains simply a Y or an N. But how can I trick a batch file that says,&quot;Press Enter to continue?&quot;andM;Stanley TsinandM;College Park, MarylandandM;Redirect the batch file to a file that contains nothing but a blank lineended by a carriage return.andM;One thing to remember is that directing a program to take its keyboard inputfrom a file rather than the keyboard works only if the program goes throughDOS to get to the keyboard (not all do).andP;  If this technique doesn't work withthe batch file you have in mind, that's probably why.andM;2K or 4K Clusters Better?andM;After reading Paul Somerson's book DOS Power Tools, I realized that my 40MBSeagate ST-251 hard drive is set up with 4K cluster sizes rather than 2K.andO;The drive is divided into four logical partitions ranging from 5MB to 15ME.andM;What is the impact of a 4K versus a 2K cluster size? Am I losing usable diskspace, slowing down disk access times or otherwise impeding disk performancewith my present configuration? if so, is there a way to reduce the clustersize?andM;John D. SnyderandM;Fort Collins, ColoradoandM;A cluster is the smallest amount of space DOS will allocate to a file.andP;  Thewasteful effect of large cluster sizes can be dramatic if you have lots oftiny files on your hard disk.andP;  If the disk is formatted with 4K clusters andcontains 100 files 500 bytes in length (consuming a total of 50K), DOSdedicates 400K--almost half a megabyte--of disk space to storing them.andP;  Adisk with 2K clusters uses exactly half that much.andP;  The good news is that theoverall storage efficiency for a typical hard disk is much higher than thisexample suggests, because most disks contain large files as well as smallones, and large files tend to balance things out.andM;Technically, 4K clusters result in slightly faster disk accesses than 2Kclusters.andP;  The larger cluster size also results in less room that must bereserved for the file system and more room for storing files.andP;  But if youhave an abnormally large number of files on your disk that are less thanabout 1K long, you're better off with smaller clusters.andM;Certain hard disk utilities such as Disk Manager and SpeedStor supportalternate cluster sizes, but they won't help you resize the clusters onconventional DOS-formatted partitions.andP;  Nor will DOS change the cluster sizefor you, or even allow you to specify what cluster size it should use whenformatting a drive or drive partition; it decides based on the size of thepartition it's formatting.andP;  The only practical recourse is to rearrange yourhard disk (using FDISK) so that no partition is smaller than 20MB.andP;  Afterreformatting, you'll end up with 2K clusters.andM;Hard Drives for Model 50andM;Are any third-party hard disks available for IBM's PS/2 Model 50?andM;Tony MarascoandM;Vandenberg AFB, CaliforniaandM;Core International makes a couple.andP;  The 44MB Optima 44 has a 21-millisecondaverage access time and lists for $895; the 80MB Optima 80 boasts a 15msaverage access time and lists for $1,695.andP;  Both drives come with a two-yearwarranty and can be installed alongside the Model 50's existing hard disk oras a replacement.andP;  An optional installation kit, available for $100, letseither drive be installed in the B: drive bay.andP;  For more information, contactCore International at (407) 997-6055 in Boca Raton, Florida.andM;PC-to-PC File TransfersandM;I recently bought a null modem cable to transfer files between an IBM PS/2Model 30/286 and an IBM PC-XT.andP;  After connecting the PCs' serial ports withthe cable, I used DOS's MODE command to initialize the ports and COPY to sendthe files across the wire.andP;  But they didn't show up on the other and.andP;  What'swrong? is the problem that the PCs are running different versions of DOS?andM;M.andP;  Keith ClemensandM;Telford, PennsylvaniaandM;The problem isn't DOS.andP;  You need a specialized file transfer utility inaddition to a null modem cable to get the job done.andP;  COPYing a file to theserial port does nothing more than send a stream of data over the wire.andO;Without software to tell it what to do, the other PC can't handle the data.andM;Two of the most popular PC-to-PC file transfer utilities are LapLink III,from Traveling Software, and The Brooklyn Bridge, from Fifth GenerationSystems.andP;  Both packages come with the cables you need as well as thesoftware.andP;  LapLink III lists for $149.95; The Brooklyn Bridge, $139.95.andO;Traveling Software can be reached at (800) 662-2652 in Bothell, Washington.andO;Contact Fifth Generation Systems at (504) 291-7221 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.andM;Converting Graphics FilesandM;Will any software convert graphics images from one file format to another?andM;Tony ColbyandM;Morton Grove, IllinoisandM;There are several packages.andP;  Check out The Graphics Link Plus, from HSCSoftware, and HiJaak, from Inset Systems.andP;  Both packages convert graphicsfile formats, list for $149 and support a variety of popular PC file formats,including EPS, PCX, WPG and TIFF.andM;HSC Software can be reached at (213) 392-8441 in Santa Monica, California;Inset Systems at (800) 828-8088 in Brookfield, Connecticut.andP;  VDISK with 31/2-inch Drive I recently had a 31/2-inch B: drive added to my XT clone.andP;  Theshop installed DOS 3.3 on my hard disk and added the line DEVICE = DRIVER.SYSD:1 to my CONFIG.SYS file.andP;  Now the 3 1/2-inch drive is accessed as D: ratherthan B:.andP;  I used to have D: set up as a RAM disk using VDISK.SYS.andP;  How con Iuse VDISK.SYS without giving up the 3 1/2-inch drive?andM;Paul TrappandM;Westville, IllinoisandM;You can use both.andP;  The key is that DOS assigns drive letters to driversloaded through CONFIG.SYS on a first-come, first-served basis.andP;  If yourCONFIG.SYS contains these two lines in this order:andM;DEVICE = DRIVER.SYS /D:1andM;DEVICE = VDISK.SYSandM;your 3 1/2-inch drive will assume the drive letter D: and your RAM disk willbe accessed as E:.andP;  With the lines reversed, the 3 1/2-inch drive becomes E:and the RAM disk D:.andP;  Either way, you can use them at the same time-justremember which letter corresponds to which device.andM;Clear Up Disk ConfusionandM;In the September 1989 Qandamp;A column, you indicated that DOS 2.1 won't recognizea hard disk formatted with DOS 3.3.andP;  isn't the converse also true--that DOS3.3 won't recognize a hard disk formatted with 2.1?andM;Clifford T KizukaandM;Cincinnati, OhioandM;Not true.andP;  DOS 3.andP;  x is backward-compatible with DOS 2.x, so that 3.3 willread a hard disk formatted with 2.1.andP;  In fact, small partitions (less than16MB) formatted with DOS 3.3 are endowed with the same file structure that2.1 uses.andM;When Will EMS Help?andM;When I upgraded from Version 1.andP;  1 to 2.0 of Ventura Publisher, I encounteredthe error message &quot;Not enough memory to run the program.andP;  Either add EMSmemory to your system or check your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files for anydrivers or resident applications that can be removed.&quot;andM;I off-loaded everything I could spare from AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS,including DOS 4.0's DOSSHELL program, but Ventura still won't run.andP;  Will EMSmemory help? is it easy to install, and just what is it, anyway?andM;Harvey R. PhillipsandM;Colts Neck, New JerseyandM;EMS memory, a term synonymous with expanded memory, is RAM that conforms tothe Expanded Memory Specification created by Lotus, Intel and Microsoft.andP;  Itis sometimes called LIM  (Lotus/ Intel/Microsoft) memory.andM;In your case, expanded memory is probably the quickest and most completesolution.andP;  What Ventura's trying to tell you is that not enough room is leftin the lower 640K for it to run after DOS, device drivers and other residentprograms are loaded.andP;  If you've pared your system to the bare minimum and theprogram still won't run, DOS may be taking up too much space--particularlysince you're using DOS 4.0, the most RAM-hungry release to date.andM;If you have a 386 machine with 1MB or more of RAM, you can use a 386 memorymanager such as Quarterdeck's QEMM-386 or Qualitas's 386Max to convert someof your extended memory into expanded.andP;  If you have a 286, you can install anexpanded memory board.andP;  Several are available from a variety ofmanufacturers, and all are simple to add to your system.andM;Another option: Use Digital Research's DR DOS 5.0, a replacement for MS-DOS.andO;DR DOS loads part of itself into high memory-RAM between 640K and1MB--leaving as much as 620K of the 640K for applications.andP;  DR DOS runs anyprogram that MS-DOS runs and adds some features, such as letting you pageback through previous command lines and edit them.andP;  It costs $199.andP;  ContactDigital Research in Monterey, California, at (800) 443-4200.andM;CHALLENGE SOLVEDandM;In the April issue, Charles J. Hutchings asked why Lotus 1-2-3's /WS commandshows only 89K of free memory with HAL loaded, but shelling out to the systemwith IS and checking available RAM shows 200K.andM;The answer: By default, HAL keeps a duplicate copy of the worksheet in memoryto support its Undo feature.andP;  The amount of available worksheet RAM shown bythe Worksheet-Status command reflects this; with two copies of the worksheetloaded, the buffer is effectively cut in half.andP;  When you shell out to thesystem with the System command, however, HAL temporarily frees the spaceoccupied by the second worksheet to make more room available for DOScommands.andP;  That explains the discrepancy.andM;If this lack of memory becomes a problem, you can turn off HAL's Undo featurewith an UNDO OFF command.andP;  Better yet, place the command in the AUTOHAL.PRNfile to disable Undo permanently.andM;Three correct answers to this month's Challenge arrived the same day: fromDavid J. Bookbinder of Salem, Massachusetts, Jefrey R. Marshall ofShreveport, Louisiana, and David J. Schmitt of Louisville, Kentucky.andM;When I print a document from WordPerfect 5.0 on my HP ThinkJet printer, theoutput is littered with random characters.andP;  The character strings d@ and 160show up a lot, usually at the and of a line, as does dD.andP;  Reprinting thedocument doesn't help; the errors recur.andP;  The unwanted characters don'tappear on the screen, but no matter what I do, I can't remove them from theprinted page.andM;I double-checked to make sure I had selected the correct printer.andP;  What elsecould be wrong?andM;Nancy BolingandM;San Jose, CaliforniaandM;Have you experienced a similar problem when printing WordPerfect documents?andO;If so, how did you solve it?
