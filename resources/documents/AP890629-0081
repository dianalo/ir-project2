It said this will not violate a 1986 European embargo.   French news commentaries said today the action appears to be aresponse to apparent moderation in recent statements and actions byLibyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.   ``France has simply taken note of a certain number ofdemonstrations of appeasement on the part of Col. Gadhafi,'' theconservative Le Figaro said in a front-page editorial.   A Defense Ministry statement Wednesday said the exports wereapproved by the Interministerial Commission for Export of WarMateriel. It denied that Crotale surface-to-air missiles wereinvolved and said France will permit no new weapons sales to Libya.   Reports by Le Figaro, Agence France-Presse and other French newsorganizations quoted unidentified officials as saying the parts willbe used to repair radar systems.   The European Economic Community banned arms sales to Libya inApril 1986 amid reports linking Gadhafi's government to terroristattacks. At about the same time, the United States bombed the Libyancapital, Tripoli, and Benghazi, citing alleged terrorist links.</TEXT></DOC>
