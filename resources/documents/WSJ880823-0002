Dan Quayle and Vice President George Bush won standing ovations in separate appearances before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention yesterday, as they moved to put behind them criticism of Mr. Quayle's National Guard service during the Vietnam War.    &quot;Go get 'em George,&quot; shouted one veteran in the audience of about 4,000 war veterans and their families as the Republican presidential candidate decried what he called the &quot;shrill partisan attack&quot; on Mr. Quayle.    &quot;He didn't go to Canada. He didn't burn his draft card and he damn sure didn't burn the American flag. And I'm proud to have him at my side,&quot; Mr. Bush said vehemently, drawing cheers from the audience. About a third of the conventioneers were Vietnam combat veterans, according to VFW officials.    It was considered an important audience for Mr. Bush in view of the controversy about Mr. Quayle's use of his family's influence to get into a National Guard public-relations unit during the Vietnam War.The 41-year-old Indiana senator broke off the campaign swing early to return to Washington to put his campaign together. The issue dominated news coverage of the GOP ticket as Mr. Bush campaigned through the Midwest last weekend with Mr. Quayle.    Shortly after Mr. Bush's solo appearance, GOP strategists hastily arranged for Mr. Quayle to fly here from Washington to address the VFW banquet last night. VFW official Larry Rivers set the tone when he introduced the Indiana senator and said: &quot;We condemn traitors, not those with a record of honorable service.&quot;    Mr. Quayle won cheers from the crowd of combat veterans when he told them: &quot;My National Guard unit -- it was never called up to active duty. After these last 72 hours, nobody can say I've never faced combat.&quot;    He again denied having used his family's influence to avoid service in Vietnam. &quot;My Indiana National Guard unit had openings before I applied, when I applied and after I applied,&quot; he said. Campaign officials handed out a formal statement from John N. Owens, who was adjutant general of the Indiana National Guard at the time of Mr. Quayle's May 19, 1969, enlistment, certifying that the statement was true.    In Massachusetts, Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, said that Sen. Quayle's qualifications would be an issue in the election. &quot;How we make our decisions, how we make the (vice) presidential selections, who we select . . . whether or not that person should be a heartbeat away from the presidency, obviously will be an an issue in the campaign,&quot; Gov. Dukakis told reporters.    Judd Clemens, a retired Army major from Eagle River, Alaska, who served in the Special Forces in Vietnam, was typical of the veterans at the convention. &quot;I'm going to vote for Bush. I don't care who is running with him,&quot; said Mr. Clemens, now a correctional officer, before Mr. Bush began his speech yesterday. &quot;I have mixed emotions about Quayle not going to Vietnam,&quot; he said, but he emphasized that other issues made him strongly for Mr. Bush.    Frank Aglira, who saw combat with the U.S. Navy during World War II, differentiated between what Mr. Quayle did and the other 1960s-era young men who tried to avoid the Vietnam draft. &quot;Those who chose to run to Canada weren't there to be called if they needed them. Those who went to the National Guard -- whether they got there by pulling strings or not -- were susceptible to be called. Therefore they weren't avoiding anything,&quot; he said.    In his speech, Mr. Bush also pledged to strengthen veterans' preference in federal hiring and to give Vietnam and other veterans &quot;the services and treatment they need and deserve.&quot; He attacked Mr. Dukakis as the only governor who &quot;refused to have a site anywhere in his state&quot; for the Ground Wave Emergency Networkknown as GWEN -- which is a military communications system designed to span the continent.    James Steinberg, Mr. Dukakis's aide on defense issues, said the Massachusetts governor opposed the GWEN system on both environmental and strategic grounds. &quot;When the administration began to sell GWEN to the Congress they repeatedly called it a system for protracted nuclear war fighting,&quot; Mr. Steinberg said. &quot;Dukakis believes we need survivable communications and that an appropriate system to let us retaliate is something we need to have. But his objection -- in addition to environmental concerns -- is that the administration was developing a strategy to mount and survive multiple nuclear strikes.&quot;    Mr. Bush urged Congress to &quot;have the nerve to stand up and close unneeded bases,&quot; and he vowed to &quot;ferret out all corruption at the Pentagon.&quot;    While Sen. Quayle was heading for Chicago, Mr. Bush flew to Spokane, Wash., for a West Coast campaign swing that will culminate Wednesday in a joint appearance with President Reagan in Los Angeles. </TEXT></DOC>
