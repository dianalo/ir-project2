<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-57-0281 </DOCNO><TEXT>The starting compound is /sup 14/C-labelled barium carbonate from whichis released labelled carbon dioxide. The reaction of carbon dioxide andlithium tetrahydride aluminate produces an aluminate complex of /sup14/C-labelled methanol. This product is decomposed by hydriodic acidinto /sup 14/-methyl iodide. After drying and removing the remnants ofhydrogen iodide, /sup 14/C-methyl iodide is stocked in ampoules. In thismanner the reaction yield will be increased to 75-80%, the time of synthesiswill be shortened and the production batch will increase from 3.7 to15 GBq. The product may be stored for long periods without any substantialradiolytic changes. The patent describes in detail the apparatus forthe preparation of /sup 14/C-methyl iodide and gives precise conditionsfor preparation. (E.S.). 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
