Hiring rates for minorities have increased little in recentyears, according to a report by the American Society of NewspaperEditors released at the convention.   The report said that 4 percent of newsroom employees, includingreporters, editors, artists and photographers, were minorities in1978, compared with 7.86 percent this year. Blacks now account for4 percent of the newsroom population, the highest percentage amongall minority groups.   ``If you look at the percentages and how slowly the industry hasmoved to respond to a very rapidly changing population, theprogress isn't nearly as impressive,'' said Johnson, an editorialwriter and columnist for the Saint Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press.   The report also said that 4 percent of newspapers across theUnited States employ no minorities.   ``Most institutions in this country are still pretty muchdominated by white middle-age males and I think the tendency ontheir part is to look out over the staff of people they direct andtake under their wing a person who reminds them of themselves,''Johnson said.   Editors surveyed by the ASNE said the most frequent reasons fornot hiring more minorities include the lack of qualified journalismgraduates, poor starting salaries and a lack of commitment toaffirmative-action hiring.   The study queried more than 300 newspaper editors, saidCornelius Foote Jr., minority affairs director of the ASNE.   On another front, Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder said negativemedia focus on the private lives of black politicians does not meanthere is a white conspiracy against leading blacks.   Recent stories, including those on the drug trial of Washington,D.C., Mayor Marion Barry, only leave that impression, Wilder said.Wilder himself has been the focus of stories saying he has used astate helicopter to spend weekends with socialite Patricia Kluge.   ``If I thought that there was a conspiracy, I couldn't exist,''Wilder said. ``I couldn't have existed in the courtroom where,being an African-American lawyer, I was asking for justice from ajury that was all white and judges who were all white. But I foundjustice.''   Wilder called for journalists to go beyond problems of the blackcommunity and focus on problems that blacks and whites have incommon.   ``We do the public a disservice _ we limit our perspective _ ifwe think of ourselves as `black' officials or as `black'journalists,'' he said.</TEXT><HEAD>Paper Sues to Keep State Out of Labor Negotiations</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The New York Daily News filed suit Aug. 1 tostop the state from intervening in contract negotiations betweenthe newspaper and its 10 unions.   The lawsuit in Manhattan's federal court seeks to dissolve afact-finding panel appointed by state Labor Commissioner ThomasHartnett to help the two sides reach agreement.   It also asks for a court order stopping the panel from takingany immediate action in the labor negotiations.   The unions, under the umbrella of the Allied Printing TradesCouncil, requested the state board of inquiry because they saidthey weren't getting a fair shake in the negotiations overcontracts that expired March 30.   The Daily News said actions by the board of inquiry, which hasthe power to subpoena witnesses and gather evidence, would cause``substantial and irreparable harm'' to the newspaper.   ``This action will exert governmental and public pressure on theDaily News and the unions in an undue and unwarranted attempt tocoerce or otherwise improperly influence a resolution of the labordispute and negotiations,'' the lawsuit said.</TEXT><HEAD>Buffalo News, Guild Settle Contract</HEAD><DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y.

That fund will be drawn down over the next two years to coverthe employees' 20 percent share of any increase in health insurancepremiums, said Robert McCarthy, president of Local 26 of theNewspaper Guild.
