In an act of defiance, many workers showed up for work atnoon yesterday, instead of 8 a.m. as required by theback-to-work order that was approved by Parliament Wednesdaynight.</LP><TEXT>   The strike, in support of contract demands, halted mostgrain exports and jeopardized the Canadian economy's recoveryfrom a year-long economic recession.   Some analysts said the strike's most serious consquencemay be on business confidence, which was shaken bystrike-caused tie-ups at U.S.-Canada border crossings. &quot;TheNorth American economy is predicated on the free movement ofgoods back and forth across the border,&quot; said Stew Low, anofficial at General Motors of Canada Ltd., a subsidiary ofGeneral Motors Corp.   The auto manufacturers rely on prompt deliveries of partsacross the border because of the low inventories they carryin their &quot;just-in-time&quot; inventory systems. Some Canadianauto-production plants have only a two-hour supply of certainparts. Ford Motor Co. and GM airlifted some parts to theirCanadian plants to relieve strike-induced shortages. But Mr.Low said there is no economic alternative to truckdeliveries. GM's plant at Oshawa, Ontario, receives 600 truckdeliveries a day, many of them from Michigan and New York.   Canada's prosperity depends on a free flow of goods acrossits border with the U.S. The U.S. and Canada do more tradethan any other pair of nations, a total of US$180 billionlast year. Exports account for almost 30% of Canada's grossnational product, or the total value of its output of goodsand services.   United Grain Growers, a Winnipeg, Manitoba, farmers'cooperative, urged the government to ban strikes bygovernment grain inspectors by designating them as essentialworkers. Many other government workers were prohibited fromparticipating in the strike because their jobs were deemed tobe essential. Most government workers have been permitted tostrike since 1967.   Grain shipments were scheduled to resume from West Coastports, but they remained halted at Thunder Bay, Ontario, by aseparate strike by stevedores that started yesterday.   Douglas Peters, Toronto Dominion Bank senior vicepresident, said the back-to-work order didn't mean thegovernment workers' dispute was settled. &quot;You can orderpublic servants back to their jobs, but you can't make themwork,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
