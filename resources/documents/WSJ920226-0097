The 1981-82 recession affected the Farm Belt(where it lingered through the mid-80s) more severely thanthe coasts; this time, the Midwest is faring much better thanthe east and west coasts. There are some important lessons tobe learned from the downturn in agriculture 10 years ago thatmight provide some insight to those confronting the recessionright now.   What agriculture suffered from 1981 to 1985 wasessentially a hangover from the intoxicating flow of cheap,easy money in the late '70s. During that period, farmersleveraged themselves to the hilt as inflation drove landvalues and commodity prices ever-higher. Bankers were eagerto lend money to farmers so that farmers could expand theiroperations; after all, as the saying in farm country went,&quot;no one's making any more of this good black dirt.&quot; Farmlandvalues in the Midwest pushed $3,000 an acre by 1980.</LP><TEXT>   But then the demand for U.S. agricultural exports fell andsurpluses mounted. At the same time, the Federal Reservetightened the supply of money. In some areas land valuesplummeted by more than 50%. Heavily indebted farmers weredriven under. All of a sudden, farmers who once had a healthybalance sheet, at least on paper, found themselves strugglingto stay afloat. Dragged down along with them were hundreds ofsmall-town banks.   Those rural banks that did survive stopped lending onproperty values alone, and insisted on a positive cash flow.Farm loans were called in. A proliferation ofhighly-publicized auctions and foreclosures followed. Evengood credit risks had trouble getting loans because lendersturned timid. Cries to bank regulators for forbearance werelost in the wind.   In the early 1980s, agriculture suffered the effects of afree-market economy as it imposed natural but painfuladjustments on the industry. Even though the Department ofAgriculture had no control over the macroeconomic forceschanging farming, farmers looked to the secretary ofagriculture to help solve their problems. For too many, helpin the form of lower interest rates and more exports arrivedtoo late.   Less than a decade later, a similar real estate crunch isagain plaguing the U.S. -- only this time the real estate islocated mainly on the East Coast and in big cities. The giddymid-1980s loosened bankers' inhibitions. Easy credit wasextended to build more and bigger residential and commercialproperties.   But the market for new developments eventually becamesaturated, particularly in the Northeast, and nervous bankersbegan calling in their loans. Developers too heavilyleveraged to comply with their lenders' demands were driveninto bankruptcy, making bankers even more tightfisted. Manyfinancial institutions (especially savings and loans) areteetering on the brink of insolvency or have been pushedover, thanks to bad loans that will never be recovered.Today's downturn closely parallels the sorry situation adecade earlier.   The result of the 1980s' agriculture recession, however,wasn't entirely negative. Those farmers who weathered thestormy 1980s are largely in sound financial shape. Overalldebt levels among farmers have dropped by an incredible $200billion since 1985, or by about one-third, both becausefarmers have paid off their loans and because bankers havewritten off bad farm debts.   As interest rates fell and exports grew in the late 1980s,farm income reached record levels. While it's true thatthousands of farmers lost their operations, the exodus fromfarm to town wasn't appreciably larger than in previousdecades. Thanks to improvements in technology, the number offarmers required to feed the country continues to drop. Theadverse economic conditions of the early 1980s simplyaccelerated a largely inevitable process.   Recession is a painful condition, but to a degree it actsas a remedy for some of the economic excesses that pass assuccesses. In a tight economy, cautious lenders demand thatreal estate must be more than a speculative pursuit requiringonly a few percent down; it must be an investment madeprudently. Borrowers must set their sights on what they canactually afford, not on what they want to own in theirwildest dreams. And consumers realize that paying off theirdebts can be as rewarding as borrowing more money, and thatburgers and beer can be as satisfying as steak and champagne.   Ultimately, recessions winnow out the wasteful, prune theinefficient and correct excesses. At times the process itselfis overly broad and many good people suffer, at home and atwork. But those that endure are smarter, more resilient, andmore appreciative of good times. As Dr. Robert Schuller oncenoted, &quot;tough times never last, but tough people do.&quot; Thatlesson may be of little solace for many as tough economicconditions confront much of the nation, but as those of uswho survived some very tough times 10 years ago can attest,there are better times ahead for those who persist.   ---   Mr. Block, president of the National American WholesaleGrocers' Association, served as U.S. Secretary of Agriculturefrom 1981 to 1986.
