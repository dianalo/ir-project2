The measures, some of which require legislation, would give Britain's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers greater power to gather confidential information and would, for the first time, let the panel suggest penalties. The self-regulatory body is staffed by the financial industry and financed by bidders in takeover fights.    The takeover panel also would be able to recommend freezing voting rights of those shareholders who refuse to reveal their identity during a takeover bid. It also could propose barring outside advisers acting for companies they suspect may violate the takeover panel's rules.    Currently, the takeover panel can't impose sanctions because it isn't a government agency or statutory body. However, under the government proposals, securities-industry regulators could apply penalties at the panel's urging.    The proposals stem from a three-month review triggered by a government investigation of Guinness PLC's controversial $3.8 billion takeover of Distillers Co. last year. The investigation has turned up evidence of a possibly illegal effort to boost Guinness's share price during the mainly stock bid.    Officials from the takeover panel, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury, the Bank of England, London's stock exchange and the Securities and Investments Board undertook the review. The new Securities and Investments Board is expected to become the government's designated financial watchdog soon.    Among the legislative changes needed to enact the proposals would be one giving the panel access to confidential share-trading information from the stock exchange, the Securities and Investments Board and other financial-industry monitors.    Contrary to expectations, the government didn't suggest adding government officials to the takeover panel.    The opposition Labor Party couldn't be reached for comment late yesterday. In March, it proposed making the takeover panel a statutory body controlled by the Securities and Investments Board. The party also complained that the panel had &quot;no investigative powers of its own&quot; and had &quot;no effective sanction other than public rebuke.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
