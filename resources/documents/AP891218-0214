Sak Sutsakarn, commander-in-chief of the Khmer People'sNational Liberation Front. ``Why won't the world support thenon-communists in Cambodia? Especially Cambodia _ we have sufferedmore than anyone.''   The apparent reason for the diminishing support is a concernthat the non-communists are coordinating their military offensivewith the communist Khmer Rouge, which took power in 1976 andinflicted a reign of terror on Cambodia that left a million or moredead.   The National Liberation Front, the Khmer Rouge and anon-communist group loyal to Prince Nordom Sihanouk, the formerhead of state, have formed a loose alliance that has been wagingwar against the Vietnamese and the Cambodian government theyinstalled in Phnom Penh, the capital, in 1979.   The coalition, which holds Cambodia's seat in the UnitedNations, is largely armed by China, but the two non-communistfactions get U.S. and other Western financial and political support.   The non-communists still reel from charges of corruption,internal bickering and being militarily inneffectual. But they haveestablished better internal discipline over the past two years and,in recent months, they have shown battlefield prowess.   In recent weeks, a number of U.S. congressmen have criticizedWashington's support for the non-communists as tantamount tosupport for the Khmer Rouge.   Britain backed away from supporting the non-communists inNovember following media reports that the British were trainingsoldiers ``under the control of Pol Pot,'' the shadowy Khmer Rougeleader who led Cambodia's terror government until a Vietnameseousted him in 1979 after they invaded the country.   Australia and France have voiced support for leaving Cambodia'sU.N. seat vacant, creating more cracks in what only months ago wasa solid Western bloc of support for the coalition.   All three groups seek either the downfall of the government ofleader Hun Sen in Phnom Penh or leverage at the negotiating table,but reporters able to reach battle zones or newly taken towns haveseen no sign of joint military operations between thenon-communists and the Khmer Rouge.   With the bodies of government soldiers lying in nearby trenches,National Liberation Front guerrillas celebrated their biggestvictory of the war recently with the capture of Svay Chek, a keytown.   ``Where are the Khmer Rouge?'' said Gen. Khun Roeng pointingtoward hundreds of his guerrillas on the defense perimeter. ``TheKhmer Rouge are not invited to this party.''   Resistance leaders acknowledge, however, that they do have fieldcommunication with the Khmer Rouge but solely for reasons of notgetting in the way of each other's attacks.   The non-communists have seized more than 100 square miles ofterritory in northwest Cambodia since launching a general offensiveafter Vietnam began withdrawing its last troops from Cambodia inSeptember.   ``We have two enemies,'' says Gen. Dien Del, the NationalLiberation Front's founder. ``The first is the Vietnamese and thenthe Khmer Rouge. The Cambodian people understand that Vietnam wantsto swallow our country, and that is why all patriots have a duty towork together to save Cambodia. But we are not with the KhmerRouge, and the Khmer Rouge knows this very well.''   He added: ``We need the public support of the Americans. ... Weneed to be able to say, `Look, we are backed by the West.'''   Sak, the commander-in-chief, said: ``What happens to Cambodia ifsupport for the non-communist resistance stops? The war willcontinue between the two communists _ the Khmer Rouge and the HunSen government. There will be no peace, but it guarantees thefuture government will be a communist one.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tuesday AMs, Dec. 26</NOTE></DOC>
