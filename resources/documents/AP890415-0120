The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Friday that the 29-branchLincoln Savings and Loan Association in Irvine had dissipated its$5.4 billion in assets, had let its capital dwindle to $20 millionand was operating in an unsafe and unsound manner.   Another large savings and loan, Gibraltar Savings of BeverlyHills, Calif., was seized March 31. Regulators stressed thatLincoln's branches would remain open as usual and that all depositswere guaranteed up to the $100,000 insurance limit.   Lincoln has been up for sale while its parent, AmericanContinental Corp., a luxury resort developer based in Phoenix,Ariz., prepared to file for federal bankruptcy protection, whichwas done Thursday.   American Continental has contributed heavily to Senate campaignsand had allegedly received favorable treatment from regulators.   The bank board said Lincoln's financial troubles started inFebruary 1984, when it was bought by American Continental and itsmanagement invested in risky real estate ventures, stocks and junkbonds.   ``Management appeared to operate Lincoln mainly for the benefitof American Continental Corp. ... (and) has repeatedly violatedregulations ... and has refused to follow supervisory directives,''a bank board statement said.   Lincoln and its owner, American Continental Chairman Charles H.Keating, have been the subject of considerable controversy over thelast two years.   An examination completed in May 1987 by regulators at theFederal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco turned up substantialirregularities and recommended the seizure of the institution.   Keating then alleged bias by the regional officials, whotechnically work for a board controlled by Sandamp;L executives incompetition with Lincoln, and complained to the nation's top thriftregulator, M. Danny Wall, the chairman of the federal bank board.   Wall, in an action that angered members of Congress and topregulators at other banking agencies, prohibited regional officialsfrom acting against Lincoln. In November 1987 he granted a newreview, which was conducted by examiners based in Washington. Thatexam, concluded a year later, upheld the findings of the SanFrancisco agency.   At one point, five senators who received campaign contributionsranging from $34,000 to $112,000 from American Continental officersand employees met with regional regulators at the request ofLincoln.   Attending the April 1987 meeting in San Francisco were Sens.Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; DennisDeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz.Riegle, who would become chairman of the Senate Banking Committeeless than a year later, subsequently returned his $76,100contribution.   The House Banking Committee chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, onFriday renewed his call for Wall's resignation, blaming Wall forthe ``gross mishandling'' of the case and months of delay that willultimately cost taxpayers millions of dollars.   Wall, in a telephone interview, said that until Lincoln's parentcompany sought bankruptcy protection, the bank board faced legalobstacles in taking over the institution while it was still solvent.   He defended the decision to conduct an independent review of theSan Francisco officials' findings, saying enough questions had beenraised about their actions to warrant a second look.</TEXT></DOC>
