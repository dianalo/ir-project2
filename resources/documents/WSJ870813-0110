It provides the federal prosecutors, for the first time in a single authoritative source, a statement of sound prosecutorial policies and practices. . . . As such, it should promote the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority, and contribute to the fair, even-handed administration of the federal criminal laws. -- Benjamin R. Civiletti, attorney general, in the preface to the United States Attorneys' Manual, Title 9-Criminal Division.    ---   Independent Prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh was in the news this week, mostly receiving praise for his assertion to the American Bar Association convention that the public popularity of a possible defendant would not deter him from prosecution. But attention should also be drawn to how Mr. Walsh described his mandate. Warming to the spirit of the ABA prayer breakfast, he rhapsodized: &quot;The New Testament, like the Old, embodies a horror of falsehood; for example, for the sin of lying to the Holy Spirit through Apostle Peter, Ananias and his wife Sapphira were struck dead. From their origins in the Bible, truth and the rule of law took root in the common law of England in the Middle Ages. . . . The English Revolution of the 1640's and the Glorious Revolution of 1688 settled that the King was indeed under the law.&quot; Mr. Walsh clearly sees his post as anything but an &quot;inferior officer&quot; of the executive branch, and sees himself answerable to no one save his own vision of justice.    By contrast, the Federal Attorney's Manual, produced by the Carter administration, sets out to codify the Justice Department's many years of tradition and professional experience on which potential prosecutions should be pursued. In the words of its text, it seeks &quot;to promote the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial discretion.&quot; It provides ample room for bringing unpopular prosecutions. But it reminds U.S. attorneys that resources such as law enforcement budgets and personel must be sensibly deployed, that the power to prosecute is in itself the power to punish, that overly ambitious prosecution threatens the law itself. In short, law enforcement is not a game of &quot;gotcha.&quot; As Mr. Civiletti wrote, &quot;A determination to prosecute represents a policy judgment that the fundamental interests of society require the application of the criminal laws to a particular set of circumstances.&quot;    Thus, the manual raises many considerations to ponder: &quot;In recognition of the fact that resort to the criminal process is not necessarily the only appropriate response to serious forms of antisocial activity, Congress and state legislatures have provided civil and administrative remedies for many types of conduct that may also be subject to criminal sanction&quot;; &quot;Involvement by attorneys for the government in the inducement of guilty pleas by defendants who protest their innocence may create an appearance of prosecutorial overreaching&quot;; &quot;. . . the prosecutor may properly weigh such questions as whether the violation is technical or relatively inconsequential in nature, and what the public attitude is toward prosecution under the circumstances of the case.&quot;    This kind of subtlety and sophistication seems wholly lacking in the heat-seeking-missile behavior of the special prosecutors. It is perhaps best captured in the contrast over &quot;probable cause.&quot; In his speech, Mr. Walsh said that if an investigation finds &quot;probable cause that crimes have been committed, it is the duty of independent counsel to prosecute.&quot; The manual, by contrast, says that probable cause &quot;is, of course, a threshold consideration only. Merely because this requirement can be met in a given case does not automatically warrant prosecution.&quot; Mr. Walsh, in short, has abandoned the whole of prosecutorial discretion.    In theory special prosecutors are supposed to follow standard Justice Department policy. But they don't, because their incentive system drives them unquestioningly toward prosecution. Unlike normal prosecutors, their work is measured in the outcome of one, highly public case. What's more, they are &quot;independent&quot; of the experience and lore accumulated in the executive branch, which often serves as a restraining hand on prosecutorial enthusiasm.    Of course, the notion behind special prosecutors is that the executive cannot investigate itself. But in their wisdom, the Founding Fathers have already provided a check and balance to deal with abuse of that power. Unlike kings, presidents can be impeached. The Constitution makes impeachment possible to check executive abuses, but difficult to prevent the legislature from using it as a petty political weapon against the executive. The unfettered independent counsel, appointed to investigate executive misdeeds in a way that congressional misdeeds are never investigated, is designed to bend itself to the latter purpose.    The constitutional separation that puts law enforcement in the executive branch is not some abstract argument. The nation survived well with it for more than 180 years leaving it to the president to see that laws are faithfully executed. With the independent counsel we have devalued the accumulated wisdom of how to bring federal prosecutions, in the process creating two standards of justice. The power to prosecute U.S. citizens &quot;independently&quot; ought to be removed from the American system. </TEXT></DOC>
