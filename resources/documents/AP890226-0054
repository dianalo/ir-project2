Most of the audience at Carnegie Hall for the first of twoconcerts by the Vienna conducted by Karajan had heard the``Unfinished'' numerous times. Saturday night's audience heard it asthough experiencing it for the first time.   The Vienna can playas softly as a murmur. But there are aspectsto this magnificent orchestra's playing that one forgets. Sound canswell in certain groups of instruments without getting generallyloud. Low-toned instruments can convey depths of feeling. Theplaying _ and not only the famous silken violins _ is so smooth thata listener's breathing is calmed.   Karajan brought up sections of instruments whose sound wasn'temotionally whipped up but seemed to be filled with emotion.   But the most awe-inspiring aspect was the playing of Schubert'smelodic themes. Each began like a tiny shoot through the surroundingground of the orchestral playing and grew straight, getting bigger,to bud then bloom. The themes weren't overblown or overpowering, butwe never heard them so majestic.   Karajan, who is 80, has been music director of the BerlinPhilharmonic since 1955. He has long conducted the ViennaPhilharmonic, both at the Salzburg Festival and in Vienna. This isthe first time he has conducted it here in 30 years. The orchestracurrently has no resident conductor.   Some expected Karajan to enter the stage in a wheelchair, but hewalked, holding the arm of a musician. The back of the podium wasmade with a kind of bench, against which Karajan leaned while heconducted. He walked off the stage and then walked back to thepodium to take bows. He received standing ovations at every entranceand exit.   The second half of the program was short pieces by Johann andJosef Strauss, which the Vienna Philharmonic annually plays on atelevised New Year's concert. These can be breezy confections, butthe Vienna Philharmonic and Karajan gave them more substance thanthat.   The overture to ``The Gypsy Baron'' was trippingly joyful and onecould see the spirit of a young man in the maestro's gestures.   ``Music of the Spheres'' had majestic yearning, an uplightingsection and flowing sweetness. ``Annen-Polka'' floated delicatelyits second time through.   The less familiar ``Hilarion Waltz'' began with a storm brewing,became expansive with pretty melodies and continued through severalelaborate sections. ``Perpetuum mobile,'' which is dizzyingly fast,ended by fading away and Karajan giving a theatrical ``what could Ido?'' shrug.   ``The Emperor Waltz'' evokes the ringing sound of success and anopulent way of life.</TEXT></DOC>
