SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The number of babies being born in the UnitedStates is bounding back from the low levels of recent years,according to a new report that shows the increase occurring despitea decline in the number of women in the prime childbearing ages.   Births totaled 3.9 million last year, up 2 percent from the yearbefore and the most in this country since 1964, the National Centerfor Health Statistics reported Tuesday.   At the same time, the Center said, the nation set an all-timerecord for the number of deaths in a year, marriages declinedslightly and the number of divorces increased.   The statistical center, a division of the Department of Healthand Human Services, said the 1988 birth rate was 15.9 per 1,000people, up from 15.7 a year earlier.   ``Within the childbearing ages the number of women 15-29declined while the number of women 30-44 increased,'' reported theCenter. It noted that the ages 20 to 29 have traditionally been theprime years for American women to have children.   Thus, an increase in the overall number of births at the sametime the most productive segment of the population is shrinkingindicates a shift in the timing of births, a phenomenon populationexperts have been expecting in recent years.   Martin O'Connell, a fertility researcher at the Census Bureau,commented increasing births among women in their 30s indicatesan adjustment pattern in tlife cycle of women.   The nun in the 30 to 44 age group is increasingsimply because so many were born duri post World War II BabyBoom, O explained in a telephone interview.   But th ratio of births between the youlder women isshifting, he said. That compensates for the declining number ofer women.   Women in their 20 averaging about 110 births per1,000 women annually, compared with about 70 for women in their0s, he said.Twenty years ago, he said, the ratio was more thanin favor of the youngergroup.Age-specific birth rates for 1988 were not yet available.   Bt federal reports show that in 17.8 per1,000 women aged 20 to 24 and 145.1 for those aged 25 t. Womenaged 30 to 34 had a rate of 73.3 but by the ages of 35  39 itfell to 31.7.   By 19aged 20 to 24 was down to 115.1 andit was 112.9 for those 25 to 29, a significant decline over theyears as women postponed marriage and childbearing in favor ofhigher educations and beginning careers, O'Connell explained.   For those aged 30 to 34 the rate was down also, falling to 61.9,whileen aged 35 to 39 were having 19.8 babies per 1,000.   Since 1e continued to see a decline,with the rate falling to 108.2 for those under 25 and 109.2 at 25to 29 by 1986, the most recent year for which tisticswere available.   But between 1980 and 1986 the rates rebounded for the oldergroup, a situation that appears to be continuing. The0 to 34 and 24.3 atages 35 to 39.   This delay is from a combination of factors, O'Connell said,including delays in marriage that are resulting in a shift in thetiming of childbearing for women.   The delay allows them to become more established in a career andpotentially financially more sren,researchers pointed out at the meeting of the PopulationAssociation of America last week.   This allows women to decide to have children sooner aftermarriage than they might if wed while younger and also gives them asense of security in casehe marriage should fail, researcherssaid.   Deaths in 1988 ord representing anincrease of 44,000 from the year before. The rising population andits increasing average age has led to record numbers of deaths inmost recent years.   The 1988 death rate was 8.8 per 1,000 people, up from 8.7 a yearearlier.   ``Contributing to the increase in the death rate was theincreasing proportion of older persons in the population and theinfluenza outbreak during the first four months of 1988,'' theCenter for Health Statistics reported.   The Center's annual report also showed 2.4 million marriages in1988, down 1 percent from the year before, and 1.2 milliondivorces, a 2 percent increase.</TEXT></DOC>
