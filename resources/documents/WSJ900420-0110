The office-vacancy rate wasa comfortable 10%, and the plan -- to build a700,000-square-foot office building overlooking Biscayne Bay-- seemed a sure bet.   So out of the ground rose Barnett Tower, 33 stories ofsteel and glass, the handiwork of Lincoln Property Inc., aDallas developer, and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. With anaverage of 1,000 people moving to Florida every day and Miamiemerging as the business hub of Latin America, a first-classskyscraper on Brickell Avenue -- Miami's Wall Street --couldn't lose. Or so its builders thought.</LP><TEXT>   Today, three years after Barnett Tower was completed, itstill sits 40% empty. Around it, in two dozen buildingslining Brickell, &quot;For Rent&quot; signs hang on an additional onemillion square feet of office space despite rentalconcessions of 20% off listed rates. In all, nearly a quarterof the avenue's five million square feet of space lie vacant,with sharply higher vacancy rates among the seven officetowers built in the past five years.   &quot;I don't think any prudent developer would have built anyof these buildings had we known then what we know now,&quot; saysDarryl Parmenter, a former managing partner of Lincoln whonow owns his own Miami real-estate firm. &quot;We overbuilt.&quot;   The story is the same nearly everywhere in Florida.Rampant overbuilding, sparked by a booming economy in theearly- and mid-1980s, has produced one of the softestreal-estate markets in the state's history. Need some officespace? Florida has 41 million square feet for rent -- athree-year supply. Looking for a break on a lease? Developersfrom Tampa to Miami, where office vacancy rates in some areashover close to 30%, will cut between 20% and 40% from listedrents. Want to buy a little land in Palm Beach County?Residential lots that sold for $70,000 in late 1988 now gobegging at $48,000.   Other states, of course, also are plagued by weakreal-estate markets. But real estate is more than justanother industry in Florida. It's what oil was to Texas: aseemingly endless source of profit and pleasure for anyonewilling to put up some money. Office parks, and indeed wholetownships, stand as monuments to speculators made rich. SaysClifton A. Poole Jr., a top federal bank regulator, &quot;There'sjust something about (Florida) that says, `Come on, and get apiece of the action.'&quot; Now, however, the action in Florida --the nation's third-largest real-estate market, afterCalifornia and Texas -- is drying up.   In recent weeks, moreover, Florida's commercial-propertyglut has come back to haunt one of the prime forces behindits building boom: overzealous lenders. Since mid-March, someof the state's biggest, most profitable banks, includingBarnett Banks Inc. and Southeast Banking Corp., haveincreased their loan-loss reserves, slashed earningsestimates and seen credit ratings reduced in the wake ofspecial regulatory examinations. The Office of theComptroller of the Currency, already stung by bankingdisasters in the Southwest and New England, says theexaminations were prompted specifically by concern aboutcommercial real-estate loans.   Amid falling real-estate prices and rising worry about acredit squeeze by wary lenders, developers and lenders acrossthe state are asking: Where's the bottom? Florida has oftenstumbled in the past, most recently in the mid-1970s whenreal-estate investment trusts fueled a building boom thatwent bust. Since then, a combination of sun, sand and, morerecently, Mickey Mouse has warded off another debacle. But isthis the start of a full-fledged crash? Responses are mixed.   &quot;We have to be careful not to confuse a minor adjustmentwith a major correction,&quot; says Malcolm T. Murray, the chiefcredit officer of First Union Corp., a Charlotte, N.C.,bank-holding company with a $6 billion portfolio of loans oncommercial real estate in Florida. &quot;Yes, the commercialmarket is soft, but we're not in some kind of free fall.&quot;   Indeed, some economists say Florida's problems aren't asdire as those in Texas, Arizona and Massachusetts. DonaldRatajczak, the director of Georgia State University'sEconomic Forecasting Center, notes that an expandingmanufacturing base and bustling tourism, anchored by DisneyWorld, are adding almost 150,000 jobs a year to the state'stax rolls. &quot;Those kinds of numbers can quell a lot ofconcerns,&quot; he says.   What they can't seem to quell, however, are fears amongsome developers and bankers that the staggering oversupply ofcommercial and residential real estate has left the statemore vulnerable than at any time in the past decade to thefallout from any nationwide recession. If Northeast andMidwest &quot;feeder&quot; markets, the source of Florida's populationgrowth, weaken further, neither sun nor sand nor Mickey maybe able to avert a crash.   &quot;The problem is likely worse than most people now think,&quot;says R. Thomas Powers, who directs economic research atGoodkin Research Corp. in Fort Lauderdale.   Tampa's glut of commercial property typifies the problemsthroughout Florida: The area is awash in office space becauselenders and builders, thinking the market would always bounceback, continued to lend and build even as the demand forspace began to soften in 1987. Now, many of the financiallyweaker buildings have been repossessed and additionalforeclosures are likely because no improvement is expectedfor at least another year.   &quot;We were gorging ourselves on new space in the 1980s,&quot;says George Bartlett, the first vice president of brokerageservices at Coldwell Banker in Tampa. &quot;Nobody wanted to hear`the market doesn't need that building now.'&quot;   In Tampa's Westshore area, near the airport, the totalsquare footage of office space went from three million in1982 with a 12% vacancy rate, to six million in 1985 with a29% vacancy rate, to nine million today with a vacancy rateof about 21%. With the market's ability to absorb the spacedeclining sharply in the past five years, construction inWestshore has ground to a halt despite developers' blueprintsfor some eight more office buildings -- nearly two millionsquare feet -- in the area. The reason for the &quot;de facto&quot;moratorium: Large rental discounts to lure tenants make mostbuildings unprofitable.   &quot;Nobody will build a building with (today's) concessionsat 20% to 40% off listed rents,&quot; says Douglas Rothschild, acommercial broker in Tampa. Effective annual rents, he says,are in the $15-to-$17-a-square-foot range in Westshore, butdevelopers need rents of $18 to $19 to cover their costs.&quot;None of the buildings built since 1985 have realized whatdevelopers expected,&quot; Mr. Rothschild says.   Consequently, four of the 17 buildings built in Westshorein the past five years have been repossessed. In 1983, forexample, Patrick Morley paid the highest price ever forWestshore land -- $32 a square foot, according to Mr.Rothschild. Mr. Morley, who hasn't returned repeated phonecalls seeking comment, planned a three-building,750,000-square-foot office complex called Tampa Commons,midway between downtown Tampa and the airport.   But by the time the Orlando developer completed the firstof the three buildings two years later, vacancy rates hadsoared, and he was forced to offer 30% to 40% concessions offrents. Because he couldn't cover his loans with theunexpectedly low revenue, Mellon Bank repossessed thebuilding, and Freedom Savings andamp; Loan (now run by ResolutionTrust Corp., the federal agency set up to manage failedthrifts) foreclosed on the remaining land. Building No. 1 ofthe project still sits half-empty. Buildings No. 2 and No. 3were never built. And because the first building was meant toconnect with the other structures through mezzanine walkways,it has no main entrance on the street. Instead, its entrancefaces a condemned, one-story structure with graffiti on theplywood covering its doors and windows.   The land for Buildings No. 2 and No. 3 is now for sale byResolution Trust at $22 a square foot, but Mr. Rothschildsays the real value is no more than $17 a square foot. Mr.Morley &quot;got involved in the overbuilt frenzy of Tampa and hitthe market totally wrong,&quot; Mr. Rothschild says. &quot;Everybodywas trying to get into the pot.&quot;   Although concerns about commercial property are paramount,200 miles to the south and east of Tampa, residential marketsare also being pummeled -- in none other than Palm BeachCounty. In the 1980s, the affluent county caught fire whenhordes of Northeasterners in their 40s and 50s moved Southafter selling homes and businesses whose values hadskyrocketed. Now, as the Northeast's economy cools off, thatpool of migrants is drying up. And many new Floridians wantto go home.   &quot;They thought they could come down here and get apart-time job and live the good life in the sun,&quot; says JohnSpies, a Florida specialist at a Houston research firm,American Metro-Study Corp. &quot;It didn't work. A lot of peopleoverextended themselves to where their standard of living isnot as good as it was up North.&quot;   The statistics are ominous. North Palm Beach County has a13- to 15-month supply of new single-family houses for sale,up from a &quot;normal&quot; supply of about nine months, according toMetro-Study. After a recent sell-off of better homes, thesouthern part of the county now has about a 12-month supply,but &quot;the ones left will be very difficult to sell withoutdiscounts of more than 20%,&quot; Mr. Spies says. The county alsohas a 28-month supply of vacant lots ready for building, withan additional 70-month supply plotted for development butwithout roadways, sewer and water lines and other utilitiesinstalled.   Two additional clouds hover over Florida: a possiblecredit crunch and the potential sale of billions of dollarsof commercial property by Resolution Trust.   Publicly, banks deny planning to clamp down on lending.Indeed, when Barnett Banks announced in March a $60 millioncharge to earnings, Charles E. Rice, its chief executive,said it &quot;will continue to meet the credit needs of itscustomers, including . . . real-estate lending.&quot;   Privately, however, some developers and bankers, citingthe increased scrutiny by federal regulators, say the spigothas already been turned down. &quot;To require more documentationor collateral is almost like removing another layer ofborrowers,&quot; one banker says.   Meanwhile, failed thrifts have dumped about $5 billion ofcommercial property into Resolution Trust. An additional $24billion worth is likely to be seized in the next three years.And the agency faces mounting pressure to unload property,perhaps at fire-sale prices. Such a move, coupled with adownturn in the national economy, could spell disaster forFlorida.   &quot;Your gut instinct is to be careful and not use abroad-brush approach about this situation,&quot; says Bert Ely, abank consultant in Alexandria, Va. &quot;But with all that supplyout there, if we see a recession in the next six months, oreven a year, all bets are off.&quot;   ---                 Florida: Space for Rent                                                                                                        Average office vacancy rates, in percent, for countywideareas                                                                                                                                 1983           1989                                                                                                        Miami                   10.0%          22.3% Fort Lauderdale         15.4%          28.0% West Palm Beach         10.0%          26.5% Jacksonville            10.6%          22.8% Tampa Bay               15.8%          16.0% Orlando                 12.0%          21.0%                                                                                                          Source: Goodkin Research Corp.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          FIRST UNION Corp. said its commercial real-estateportfolio in Florida totals about $2.59 billion.
