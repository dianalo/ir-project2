In the wake of last month's election, East Germansappeared eager to unify with their Western cousins. Theystill are. But East German enthusiasm for unity is nowtempered with a growing sense that they'll have to guardtheir own interests along the way, because nobody else will.</LP><TEXT>   This realization helped pull together the East'ssquabbling political factions, which have now put the finaltouches on a ruling coalition. After three weeks ofwrangling, the East Germans last night announced they hadcleared the last hurdles to a &quot;grand coalition&quot; made up ofconservatives, Social Democrats, and a small coalition ofliberal parties.   The new government is expected to be formally endorsed bythe East German parliament today. Without a legitimate EastGerman government, there was nobody for the West Germans tonegotiate with over a future monetary union. Similarly, theso-called two-plus-four talks, involving the two Germanys andthe four victorious wartime allies, the U.S., France, Britainand the Soviet Union, can now start working on theinternational aspects of German unity.   The strength of East Berlin's negotiating position hingeson the ability of the East German parties to pull together.In this regard, the new government seems to be off to astrong start. East Germany's conservative premier-designate,Lothar de Maiziere, led negotiations with the center-leftSocial Democrats that often seemed snarled over differingviews on the pace and conditions of German unity. The SocialDemocrats favor a slow approach, while the conservatives wantutmost speed toward a merger. In the end, the two sides wereable to compromise.   The Social Democrats, for instance, want to shiftownership of state-owned companies to workers, while theChristian Democrats want to sell them to anyone. As a partialsolution, the two sides agreed that the property of EastGerman citizens should be protected for 10 years, and thatEast Germans should have first crack at companies about to beprivatized.   Forming unified positions on such sensitive topics iscrucial, because it allows the East Germans to speak with onevoice when negotiating with Bonn. Mr. de Maiziere'sconservative alliance got enough votes to build a majoritywithout the Social Democrats, but it needs a two-thirdsmajority in parliament to push through the constitutionalchanges necessary to clear the way for unification.   East Germany's new leaders share many of the same goals astheir West German counterparts, but the government nowemerging has shown it can flex its muscles. Nowhere is thismore visible than in the explosive dispute over the exchangerate for the East German mark.   East Germans were jolted last week when the Bonngovernment appeared to backtrack on earlier promises of agenerous one-to-one exchange rate for their currency,favoring instead a West German Bundesbank plan to convertonly 2,000 marks at this rate with the rest exchanged at aless-favorable two-to-one rate. The West Germans neverpromised a sweeping one-to-one conversion, but East Germanshad come to expect it.   East Germans took to the streets to protest the lower rateand, in a sharp break with the tone of the election campaign,aimed their ire specifically at West German Chancellor HelmutKohl. The uproar gave East Berlin a new sense of its ownpower, because it showed that East Germans would activelysupport its positions, even if they seemed to throw barriersin the path of early unification.   The dispute helped the East German parties move towardcompromise. Mr. de Maiziere's willingness to criticize Bonn-- and even his supporter, Helmut Kohl -- convinced SocialDemocrats that the conservatives would fight for East Germaninterests. Some critics had argued that the conservativeswouldn't dare contradict their Western patrons.   The conservatives had not only pledged to work for quickunion with the West, they had also designated a West Germanconservative, Elmar Pieroth, to play the key role ofnegotiating the merger as economics minister. But in the wakeof the exchange-rate dispute, Mr. Pieroth was dropped to therank of economic adviser. The economics ministry will stillgo to a conservative, East German Gerhard Pohl, who wants theone-to-one currency swap to apply to up to 30,000 marks perperson. &quot;An exchange amount of 2,000 marks is no good, it'smuch too small,&quot; he told West German reporters.   Meanwhile, Rainer Eppelmann, a peace activist and leaderof the conservative Democratic Awakening Party, is expectedto be East Germany's new defense minister. In this post, hecould significantly influence East-West negotiations over therole of Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Tounderscore the obvious, the East Germans have even changedthe ministry's name -- to the Department of Defense andDisarmament.</TEXT></DOC>
