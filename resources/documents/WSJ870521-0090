Col. Oliver North.    Adolfo Calero said he met as often as 50 times with Col. North from 1984 to 1986. He said he regularly informed the former White House aide of arms purchases and military initiatives by the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, beginning in late 1984 when Congress prohibited U.S. military assistance to the rebels. Records of FDN, the dominant Contra group, show that during the ban, nearly all the money the group received for military uses came from private American contributors or foreign nations approached by White House officials. Those funds were steered to the Contras by Col. North, according to the records.    Mr. Calero said he gave Col. North direct control over an estimated $90,000 in negotiable traveler's checks. In later testimony, retired Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, a middleman in some Contra arms deals, said Col. North was intimately involved in the arms purchases made by the FDN.    Gen. Singlaub described meetings he had with Col. North to discuss prices and weapons to be bought for the insurgents, and he said he later assured a private arms dealer that a weapons list drawn up in one such meeting &quot;had the blessing&quot; of his contacts in the National Security Council.    Appearing before House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair, Mr. Calero described $33.7 million in FDN receipts from mid-1984 through 1986; he said all but $417,000 of those funds came from sources linked to Col. North and the White House. The money financed nearly $19.2 million in arms purchases, including $11.4 million paid to a corporation controlled by retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a close ally of Col. North's in the Iran-Contra operation.    &quot;If the United States didn't wink an eye to other countries, we wouldn't get anything,&quot; said Mr. Calero, who testified of having a close relationship with both Col. North and William Casey, the late director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He described Mr. Casey as &quot;Uncle Bill.&quot;    The Contra leader won praise from the committees for his candor, but he often was forced to admit to a lack of knowledge about the administration's precise role in sustaining the resistance during the ban on U.S. military aid.    &quot;I used to tell Col. North practically everything,&quot; Mr. Calero testified. But he said he was never told of the origin of much of the money funneled to the FDN, or about a secret airlift mounted in 1985 and 1986.    A summary of FDN records compiled by investigators indicates the Contra force didn't directly receive funds in 1986 from the diversion of profits on U.S. arms sales to Iran. The pattern that emerges from the records instead shows that Col. North began in late 1985 to favor the private Contra supply operation he built with Gen. Secord. This covert airlift assisted the FDN's operations in northern Nicaragua, but was aimed more at developing a second front in the country's southern provinces.    After meetings with President Reagan and other White House officials, Saudi Arabia in 1984 and 1985 donated an estimated $32 million of the $33.7 million in contributions received by the FDN. An additional $1 million was funneled to FDN accounts through a Cayman Islands corporation Mr. Calero said was controlled by conservative publicist Richard Miller, a close ally of fund-raiser Carl &quot;Spitz&quot; Channell.    According to Mr. Calero's testimony and prior witnesses, Col. North was a behind-the-scenes player in both cases. An additional $200,000 came to the FDN in 1985 from the same Swiss account later used in the arms sales to Iran.    The FDN used traveler's checks to move more than $3 million between countries and to finance purchases in Central America. Receipts kept by a Cayman Island bank where Mr. Calero held accounts are now being reviewed to explain these transactions.    Only a portion of the $90,000 turned over to Col. North has been traced entirely. Mr. Calero said he turned over those funds to Col. North in a series of payments in the spring of 1985. The bulk of that money is believed to have gone to finance secret payments to other Contra political leaders, and to help finance a much larger operation to free U.S. hostages in Lebanon through bribes and ransom. Mr. Calero has said that he donated a total of $50,000 to the hostage initiative, but committee investigators so far have only traced about $25,000 to U.S. drug agents used in the operation.    An estimated $2,440 of the traveler's checks have been traced to Col. North. A summary released by the committees yesterday shows that $340 in checks were cashed at suburban Washington supermarkets to help cover purchases valued at $118 over a three-month period in 1985. Another $220 in checks were cashed at various businesses, including $100 which appears to have gone to pay for two snow tires.    &quot;When was the last time it snowed in Nicaragua?&quot; asked Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.). Most of the remaining checks cashed by Col. North appear to be linked to hotel and air travel more likely to have been related to the former White House aide's covert activities.    Gen. Singlaub, in his testimony, told the congressional investigative panels that he solicited aid for the insurgents from two countries -- separately identified by investigators as Taiwan and South Korea -- and that he purchased weapons for the Contras from a Soviet bloc country. Administration officials have said the country was Poland.    In late 1984 and early 1985, Col. North advised Gen. Singlaub that buying arms for the Contras would be legal if money for the transactions wasn't solicited or deposited in the U.S.; if the weapons weren't transported by American carriers, and if no weapons were purchased in the U.S., the retired general said.    Gen. Singlaub said he complained to Col. North about a September 1985 attempt by Ron Martin, a Miami arms dealer, to shut down a European arms dealer who was supplying arms from Poland to the Contras. According to an October 30, 1985, memo written by an associate of Gen. Singlaub, an employee of Mr. Martin told the Polish Embassy in Washington about a June 1985 shipment of arms from Poland to the Contras. As a result, the arms dealer was confronted by the Polish embassies in Austria and Switzerland, the memo said.    The retired general said Col. North told him that he'd try to stop Mr. Martin. The Contras continued to obtain weapons from Poland, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
