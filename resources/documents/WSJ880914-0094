The National Research Council, in its last report on the redesigned rockets before the launch of the next shuttle, said several improvements in the solid-fuel booster rockets, built by Chicago-based Morton Thiokol Inc., should result in &quot;considerably enhanced safety and reliability.&quot;    Thus, the panel said, it didn't object to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's current schedule for launching the next shuttle, Discovery.    NASA officials have said they expect to launch the shuttle in late September or early October. The launch date may be announced today when top space-agency officials emerge from two days of intense meetings with launch and contractor officials at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla.    The report by the council, which is an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, was generally positive in tone and lacked some of the criticism found in the panel's earlier assessments of the redesign effort.    For example, early reports faulted NASA for pursuing a single new design for the flawed booster-rocket joints, rather than several alternatives from which the best design could be chosen. But yesterday's report said the NASA strategy turned out to be effective, especially considering the time pressures to get back into space.    The failure of a rocket joint touched off the January 1986 explosion that killed the seven Challenger astronauts. NASA has made a number of changes to that joint and now &quot;has a reasonable basis for concluding that these changes have corrected the previous design deficiencies,&quot; the report said. The panel's conclusions weren't a surprise, considering that the space agency's recent tests of the redesigned rockets have been largely successful.    But the report did disclose that NASA recently found a crack in the strut of a booster rocket that is in storage for use on a future shuttle flight. The strut attaches the booster rockets to the large external tank. The finding of the crack could prompt a re-examination of the struts on the rockets used for Discovery to ensure that cracks haven't been missed there.    The panel also expressed disappointment that NASA, for budget reasons, plans to remove instrumentation from the redesigned booster rockets after the next three shuttle flights. The panel said having such instrumentation on several flights is crucial for verifying the safety of the new design, and it urged NASA to set aside the funds needed to do it.    NASA didn't comment on the report.    The panel's report, which was the seventh in a series, isn't binding on NASA. But the group's views carry a lot of weight in scientific and congressional communities, and a highly critical report could have derailed the coming launch. The panel has been monitoring the redesign of the booster since June 1986. At that time, the presidential commission investigating the Challenger accident recommended that an outside group oversee the redesign to make sure it was done properly. </TEXT></DOC>
