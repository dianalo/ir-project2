The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond leaped 25-16 points, ormore than $23 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which movesinversely from its price, tumbled to 8.83 percent from 9.06 percentlate Thursday.   The single-day price increase was the largest since the longbond gained 2| points last Sept. 2. The yield on the 30-yeargovernment security dipped to its lowest level since early February.   Yields on three-month Treasury bills plunged to 8.47 percent,their lowest level since Jan. 3.   The surge in prices followed the Labor Department's report thatwholesale prices rose 0.4 percent in April, about half as much assome analysts had expected.   ``That tended to allay the market's fear that inflation wasaccelerating,'' said William V. Sullivan, director of money marketresearch for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It also suggested for thefirst time in well over a year that the Fed may be in a position toease credit policy.''   The indication of an economic slowdown buttressed a governmentreport Thursday that showed retail sales up 0.4 percent last month,well under the 1.3 percent many economists had expected.   Sullivan said an economic slowdown along with lower prices couldlead the Federal Reserve to relax its monetary policy, encouraginglower interest rates and boosting the value of bonds.   ``People are thinking we are past the bulge in inflation causedby oil prices rising,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist withNikko Securities International Inc.

The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in theprice of a bond with a $1,000 face value.   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, whichmeasures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues withmaturities of a year or longer, climbed 13.83 to 1,145.49.   The rise in the index was the largest since a gain of 15.00 onOct. 22, 1987, three days after the stock market's Black Mondaycrash.   In corporate trading, industrials rose.
