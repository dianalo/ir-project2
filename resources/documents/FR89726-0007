(2) DCAA documents pertaining to contract audit are disseminated to staffunder the Quarterly Index of DCAA Numbered Publications and Memorandums(DCAA Instruction 5025.2).(3) The numbered publications discussed in the previous paragraph are frequentlyamended or supplemented by interim numbered memorandums pending formalrevision to the numbered publication. Additionally, numbered memorandumsare issued as auxiliary illustrations and managerial reminders. Such staffmemorandums are indexed in the Quarterly Index of DCAA Numbered Publicationsand Memorandums. Memorandums issued by Headquarters are referred to asMemorandum for Regional Directors (MRDs).(4) The DCAA Quarterly Index of Numbered Publications and Memorandums isnot published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>because of the volume, and the limited applicabilityto the general public. However, it is available upon request at no costto the general public.(5) DCAA Headquarters and each of the six regional offices will publisha quarterly index of the documents referenced previously. Documents thatare generally available to the public will be maintained in the readingrooms of the Headquarters, regional offices, FAOs, and the Defense ContractAudit Institute.(6) Documents identified in the DCAA Headquarters or regional quarterlyindices are available to the public from DCAA or the Superintendent ofDocuments. However, in some instances, it may be necessary to deny allor portions of a document if disclosure of information in the documentwould constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Insuch cases, the requester will be advised fully in writing of the rationalefor invoking the exemption.(c) <T3>Requests for the examination or copies of records. </T3>(1) Membersof the public may make written requests for copies of DCAA records or forpermission to examine such records during the normal business hours. Suchrequests must be in writing and expressly indicate that it is a requestunder the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C., section 552, or this rule.These requests should be submitted directly to the appropriate DCAA componentlisted in Appendix C of this rule. If the appropriate component is eitherunknown or cannot be ascertained, and the record is likely to be in thepossession of DCAA, the request may be submitted to Headquarters, DCAA,ATTN: CMR, Cameron Station, Alexandria, Virginia 22304-6178.(2) When submitting requests, requesters should:(i) Identify each record sought with sufficient detail to permit easy access.Information as to where the record originated, subject, date, number, orany other identifying particulars should be provided whenever possible.DCAA elements receiving requests which do not reasonably describe the recordrequested will advise the requester accordingly. Generally, a record isnot reasonably described unless the requester provides information permittingan organized, nonrandom search of DCAA files and/or information systems.In providing descriptions based on events, the requester must provide informationwhich permits DCAA components to infer the specific record sought.(ii) Identify all other Federal agencies subject to the provisions of theFreedom of Information Act to which the request has been sent. This willreduce both processing and coordination time between agencies, as wellas redundant referrals.(iii) Provide a statement of their willingness to pay assessable chargescited under the schedule of fees in 32 CFR Part 286. The statement mustinclude a specific monetary amount if the assessable fees are likely toexceed the minimum amount specified by 32 CFR Part 286 or a specific justificationfor any waiver or reduction of fees sought based on public interest inrelease or disclosure. Requesters should also substantiate any claim forthe assessment of fees under a specific fee category as explained in 32CFR Part 286. DCAA components will notify requesters of deficiencies infee declarations, and provide them the opportunity to amend initial declarations.Determinations on the adequacy of requester fee declarations are not subjectto appeal unless:(A) The DCAA component has denied a specific request for the assessmentof fees under one of the categories established in 32 CFR Part 286 or(B) Has denied a request for the waiver or reduction of fees in the publicinterest.(3) When a DCAA component has no records responsive to a request, the requesterwill be notified promptly. In cases where the request has been misdirectedand the component is aware of the appropriate FOIA respondent, the componentshall refer the request to the appropriate DCAA component or other agencythrough FOIA channels, and notify the requester of the referral. The 10working day period allowed for responding to requests will not begin untilthe DCAA component having the responsive records receives a request complyingwith procedural requirements of this rule, including statements on thepayment of fees.(4) The provisions of the FOIA are intended for parties with private interests.Officials seeking documents or information on behalf of foreign governments,other Federal agencies, and state or local agencies should be encouragedto employ official channels. The release of records to individuals underthe FOIA is a public release of information. DCAA components will considerFOIA requests from such officials as made in a private, rather than officialcapacity, and will make disclosure and fee determinations accordingly.(d) <T3>Referrals. </T3>(1) Records originating in or based on informationobtained from other Federal agencies subject to the FOIA may be referredto that agency. In processing FOIA requests for such records, DCAA components,after coordinating with the originating agency, will refer the request,along with a copy of the responsive records in its possession, to thatagency for direct response. The requester is to be notified of the referral.(2) The Director, DCAA, has delegated to the regional directors and RecordsAdministrator, CMR the authority to make initial determinations as to therelease of DCAA records to the public, including Defense contractors. Thisauthority may not be redelegated. Therefore, requests for records shouldbe processed as follows:(i) <T3>Headquarters Offices, including DCAI, Technical Services Center, FieldDetachment, and PLA/JLA, </T3>shall promptly refer all requests for DCAArecords to the Records Administrator, Headquarters, DCAA, ATTN: OMR, CameronStation, Alexandria, VA 22304-6178.(ii) <T3>Field Audit Office (FAOs) </T3>shall promptly refer all requests forDCAA records to the cognizant regional director.(3) <T3>Referral of audit reports. </T3>Audit reports prepared by DCAA areprepared for the use of the contracting officers, and their release shouldbe at the discretion of the contracting activity. Therefore, any FOIA requestfor audit reports should be referred to the cognizant contracting activityand the requester notified of the referral. Initial Denial Authoritiesshall process requests for audit reports as follows:(i) <T3>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). </T3>If the cognizant contracting officeris an official of DLA, the request will be referred to the appropriateDefense Contract Administration Services Region or buying center. SinceDLA contracting officers do not have initial denial authority, this avoidsa second referral action and unnecessary delay in responding to the request.(Refer to 32 CFR Part 286, Appendix B, for a listing of DoD Component addresses).(ii) <T3>United States Air Force (USAF). </T3>If the cognizant contracting officeris an USAF official, the request will be referred to the appropriate USAFCommand. Since USAF contracting officers do not have initial denial authority,this avoids a second referral action and unnecessary delay in respondingto the request. (Refer to 32 CFR Part 286, Appendix B for a listing ofDoD Component addresses).(iii) <T3>Army Materiel Command. </T3>If the cognizant contracting officer isa Army Materiel Command official, the request will be referred to: Freedomof Information Officer, Headquarters, Army Materiel Command, 5001 EisenhowerAvenue, Alexandria, VA 22333-0001.(iv) <T3>Others.</T3> All other requests for audit reports shall be referredto the address of the cognizant contracting officer. Referral letters shouldprovide the name and address of the contracting officer, and as much informationas possible to assist in preparing a timely reply to the requester.(4) <T3>Referral of work papers. </T3>When a request seeks workpapers, thecognizant contracting officer must furnish a notice of disposition to theappropriate activity pertaining to the releasability of the audit report.The notice of disposition will then be used to determine releasabilityof the workpapers.(5) All other requests should be directed to the appropriate Regional Director,if known. When the location of the record is not known, the request shouldbe directed to the Records Administrator, CMR.(e) <T3>Time limits. </T3>DCAA components are to respond promptly to requesterscomplying with the procedural requirements outlined in this rule.(1) Upon receipt of a properly submitted FOIA request, DCAA componentsshould contact the Records Administrator, CMR for a FOIA case number. IDAsshould: (i) Locate and assemble responsive records; (ii) Determine releasabilityunder the provisions of this rule; (iii) Determine the appropriate feesto be charged, and (iv) Advise the requester accordingly. Initial determinationson either the release or denial of records, and notice to requesters, mustbe provided within 10 working days following receipt of the request bythe cognizant component.(2) In certain cases, IDAs may need to exercise an extension to the normal10 working day period cited above. IDAs are to notify the requester, withinthe initial 10 working day period, of the extension, the circumstancesnecessitating it, and the anticipated date of a determination. Approvedextensions are not to exceed 10 working days, and all extensions shouldbe indicated on DCAA Form 5410, sections 10 and 11. Circumstances wheresuch extensions may be approved include:(i) The record(s) sought are geographically located at places other thanthe component processing the request.(ii) The request requires the collection and review of a substantial nmberof records.(iii) The disclosure determination requires consultation with another DCAAcomponent or agency with a substantial interest.(3) As an alternative to the previously mentioned, DCAA components mayseek informal agreements with requesters for extensions in unusual circumstanceswhen time limits become an issue in the Component's response to the request.(4) Misdirected requests should be referred within 10 working days to theproper agency or DCAA component through FOIA channels, and the requesternotified of the referral. The 10 working day period allowed for respondingto requests will not begin until the DCAA component having the responsiverecords receives the request.(f) <T3>Initial disclosure determinations. </T3>(1) Initial determinationsto make records available may only be made by those IDAs designated inthis rule. When a decision is made to release records in response to aFOIA request, DCAA components will promptly make the records availableto the requester. When the request is for the examination of releasablerecords, DCAA components will advise the requester when and where he orshe may appear. Examinations will be held during normal business hours.If a record is not provided in response to a FOIA request, the IDA willadvise the requester, in writing, of the rationale for not providing therecord.(2) IDAs should consult the Executive Officer, prior to releasing recordson matters considered newsworthy or when releasing records to media representatives.Copies of all released material of this nature should be submitted to theExecutive Officer.(3) The following reasons are provided for not releasing a record in responseto a FOIA request:(i) The information or item requested is not a record within the meaningof the FOIA in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, 32 CFR Parts 285and 286, and this rule.(ii) The record has not been sufficiently described to enable DCAA to locateit by conducting a reasonable search.(iii) The requester has failed to comply with procedural requirements,including agreements to pay assessable fees, imposed by 5 U.S.C. 552, asamended, 32 CFR Part 286, and this rule.(iv) DCAA determines through knowledge of its files and reasonable searchefforts that it neither controls nor possesses the requested record orthat the requested record does not exist.(v) The request is withdrawn by the requester.(vi) The request is transferred to another DCAA component or agency.(g) <T3>Denials. </T3>(1) A record in the possession and control of DCAA maybe withheld only when the record falls within one or more of the nine categoriesof records exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA, and the useof discretionary authority to release the record is determined to be unwarranted(see 32 CFR Part 286).(2) Although exempt portions of records may be denied, nonexempt portionsmust be released to the requester when the meaning of these portions isnot distorted by the deletion of denied portions, and when it can reasonablybe assumed that the excised information could not be reconstructed. Whena record is denied in whole, based on distortion or reconstruction potential,the IDA will prepare a response advising the requester of the determination,and the response will specifically state that it is not possible to reasonablysegregate meaningful portions for release.(3) When a request for a record is denied in whole or in part, the IDAwill inform the requester in writing of the specific exemption(s) on whichthe denial is based and explain the determination in sufficient detailto permit the requester to make a decision concerning appeal. The determinationwill also inform the requester of his or her appeal rights. All appealsshould be made within 60 calendar days from the date of the initial denial,contain the reasons for the requester's disagreement with the determination,and be addressed to the Assistant Director, Resources, Headquarters, DCAA,Cameron Station, Alexandria, VA 22304-6178.(4) Records or portions of records which have been previously releasedbecome part of the public domain, and cannot be denied thereafter.(h) <T3>Administrative appeals of denials. </T3>(1) If the IDA declines toprovide a record because he or she considers it exempt, that decision maybe appealed by the requester, in writing, to the Assistant Director, Resources,DCAA. The appeal should be accompanied by a copy of the letter denyingthe initial request. Such appeals should contain the basis for disagreementwith the initial refusal. Appeal procedures also apply to the disapprovalof a request for waiver or reduction of fees. A ``no record'' finding maynot be appealed, although the requester may ask the Agency to search otherfiles or the requester may provide more detailed identification to facilitateanother search. Records which are denied should be retained during thetime permitted for appeal.(2) IDAs shall advise the requester that an appeal should be filed so thatit reaches the designated appellate authority no later than 60 calendardays after the date of the initial denial letter. At the conclusion ofthis period, except for good cause shown as to why the appeal was not timely,the case may be considered closed; however, such closure does not precludethe requester from filing litigation for denial of his appeal. If the requesterhas been provided a series of determinations for a single request, thetime for appeal will begin on the date of the last determination of theseries.(3) Final determinations normally shall be made within 20 working daysof receipt of an appropriately submitted appeal.(i) <T3>Delay in responding to an appeal. </T3>(1) When additional time isrequired to respond to the appeal for the reasons outlined in paragraph290.7(e)(2), the final determination may be delayed for the number of workingdays (not to exceed 10 days) that were not utilized as additional timefor responding to the initial request. Requesters shall be advised that,if the delay exceeds the statutory extension provision or is for reasonsother than the unusual circumstances identified in paragraph 290.7(e)(2),they may consider their administrative remedies exhausted. They may, however,without prejudicing their right of judicial remedy, await a substantiveresponse. DCAA shall continue to process the case expeditiously, whetheror not the requester seeks a court order for release of the records, buta copy of any response provided subsequent to filing a complaint shallbe forwarded to the Department of Justice.(2) When the Assistant Director, Resources, DCAA, makes a determinationto release all or a portion of the records on appeal, the records shallbe made available promptly to the requester after compliance with proceduralrequirements, such as payment of fees. The final denial of a request willbe made in writing, explain the exemption(s) invoked, advise that the materialbeing denied does not contain meaningful portions that are reasonably segregable,and also advise the requester of the right of judicial review.(j) <T3>Judicial action. </T3>A requester will be deemed to have exhaustedhis administrative remedy after he has been denied the requested recordby the Assistant Director, Resources, or when the Agency fails to respondto his request within the time limits prescribed by 32 CFR Part 286 andthis rule. The requester may then seek an order from a U.S. District Courtin: (1) The district in which he resides or has his principal place of business;(2) The district in which the record is situated; or (3) In the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, enjoiningthe Agency from withholding the record and ordering its production.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 290.8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fees</ITAG>(a) Fees shall be determined in accordance with the Department of Defensefee schedule (32 CFR Part 286, Subpart F). Fees reflect direct costs forsearch, review (in the case of commercial requesters), and duplicationof documents, collection of which is permitted by the FOIA. Fees are subjectto limitations on the nature of assessable fees based on the category ofthe requester established in 32 CFR Part 286; statutory and automatic waiversbased on the category determination and cost of routine collection; andeither the waiver or reduction of fees when disclosure serves the publicinterest. (b) Fees will not be charged when direct costs for a FOIA request are lessthan the automatic fee waiver threshold specified in 32 CFR Part 286, regardlessof category.(c) <T3>Fee assessment. </T3>In order to be as responsive as possible to FOIArequests, DCAA components should adhere to the following when assessingfees;(1) Evaluate each request to determine the requester category and adequacyof the fee declaration. An adequate declaration requires a willingnessby the requester to pay fees in an amount equal to, or greater than, theassessable charges for the request.(2) Provide requesters an opportunity to amend inadequate fee declarationsand provide estimates of prospective charges when required. When a requesterfails to provide an adequate declaration within 30 days after notificationof a deficiency, the request for information will be considered withdrawn.(3) A requester's claims for assessment of fees under a specific categorywill be carefully considered. The IDA may require a requester to substantiatea claim for assessment under a claimed category. In the absence of requesterclaims, the IDA will determine the category into which a requester falls,basing its determination on all available information.(4) When a DCAA component disagrees with a requester claim for fee assessmentunder a specific category, the IDA will provide the requester with writtendetermination indicating the following:(i) The requester should furnish additional justification to warrant thecategory claimed;(ii) A search for responsive records will not be initiated until agreementhas been attained relative to the category of the requester;(iii) If further category information has not been received within a reasonableperiod of time, the component will render a final category determination;and(iv) The determination may be appealed to the Assistant Director, Resources,within 60 calendar days of the date of the determination.(d) Components may not require advance payment of fees 32 CFR Part 286.However, when a DCAA component determines that allowable charges are likelyto exceed the ($250) amount specified in 32 CFR Part 286, the componentmay require a provisional payment in an amount up to the full estimatedcharges. Provisional payments may not be required for requests with estimatedfees of the amount specified in 32 CFR Part 286 or less.(e) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged within30 calendar days from the date of billing, DCAA components may requirethe requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interestor demonstrate satisfaction of the debt, and to make an advance paymentof the full amount of estimated fees, before processing begins on a newor pending request.(f) The administrative time limits for responding to a request will beginonly after the component has received an adequate declaration from therequester stating a willingness to pay fees, and satisfaction that alloutstanding debts have been paid.(g) DCAA components can bill requesters in accordance with 32 CFR Part286 for services provided in responding to a request. Payment of fees maybe made by personal check, bank draft drawn on a U.S. bank, or by U.S.Postal money order. All payments of this type are to be made payable tothe U.S. Treasurer.(h) <T3>Aggregating requests. </T3>Occasionally, a requester may file multiplerequests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents,solely to avoid payments of fees. When a component reasonably believesthat a requester is attempting to do so, the component may aggregate suchrequests and charge accordingly. One element to be considered in determiningwhether a belief would be reasonable is the time period in which the requestshave occurred. In no case may components aggregate multiple requests onunrelated subjects from one requester.(i) <T3>Fee waivers. </T3>(1) The determination to waive fees is at the discretionof IDAs designated in this rule in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552 and 32CFR Part 286. When direct costs for a FOIA request total the automaticfee waiver threshold specified in 32 CFR Part 286, or is less, fees shallbe waived automatically for all requesters, regardless of category.(2) Documents will be furnished without charge, or at a charge reducedbelow fees assessed to the categories of requesters listed in 32 CFR Part286, when the IDA determines that a waiver or reduction of fees is in thepublic interest because furnishing the information is likely to contributesignificantly to public understanding of the operations of DCAA, and isnot primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. DCAA componentsshould refer to 32 CFR Part 286 for factors to consider in applying feewaivers due to public interest. Each fee decision must be considered ona case-by-case basis and upon the merits of the information provided ineach request. When the question of whether to charge or waive the fee cannotbe clearly resolved, components should rule in favor of the requester.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 290.9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Information/reporting requirements.</ITAG>The reporting requirements for this part are set out in 32 CFR 286.41.Those requirements have been assigned Report Control Symbol DD-PA(A)1365.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix A to Part 290_DCAA Headquarters and Regional FOIA ProcessingProcedure Charts<G/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert Illus. 051</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3810-01-M003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 052-054</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3810-01-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix B to Part 290_DCAA Form 5410-2(R)<G/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert Illus. 056</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix C to Part 290_DCAA Organization and Mission</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) <T3>Purpose. </T3>This section implements 5 U.S.C. 552 by describing thecentral and field organizations of DCAA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Origin and authority. </T3>DCAA was established by the Secretary ofDefense under Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5105.36 and began operatingon July 1, 1965.
