Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/11/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B5A</SO><CO>   MRMT</CO><IN>BUILDING MATERIALS (BLD)</IN><LP>   WASHINGTON -- A nationwide campaign to reduce burns fromscalding baths and showers could change plumbing industrypractices and provide a windfall to a small Connecticutmetals company.   About 5,000 children are scalded by water each year. Thevictims are generally young children who are burnedaccidentally in the bathtub. Many require expensivehospitalization and painful skin grafts; some die. Elderlyand handicapped bathers are also particularly susceptible tohot-water burns, which often occur because many residentialwater heaters are set too high.</LP><TEXT>   The plumbing industry has moved slowly to address thisproblem. Although anti-scald devices have been available formany years, &quot;72% of all bathtub and shower valves sold todaystill have no safety or scald protections incorporated intotheir design,&quot; says William Kamela, the director of publicpolicy for the National Safe Kids Campaign. In mid-May, SafeKids, a child safety organization whose chairman is formerSurgeon General C. Everett Koop, plans to launch a campaignto reduce scalds.   Safe Kids is working through local coalitions across thenation to try to win changes in building codes to require theinstallation of valves that will shut off water that suddenlyturns dangerously hot. The campaign highlights a safety valvemade by Memry Corp., a small Norwalk, Conn., company.   The firm makes scald-protection devices that automaticallyshut off hot water exceeding 120 degrees (comfortable bathwater runs between 100 degrees and 105 degrees). Safe Kidsargues that safety valves offer the best protection againstwater heaters that are set too high or sudden blasts of hotwater that often occur when toilets are flushed in the samebuilding. On many older water heaters, the temperatures areset at 140 degrees or higher.   For both Safe Kids and Memry, their combination is like amarriage made in heaven. The Memry valves, sold under thenames Shower Gard and Flow Gard, retail for under $20 and aresimple for homeowners to install. More traditional safetyvalves cost several times more and require installation by aplumber.   The safety campaign, which will include nationwideadvertising and education efforts, promises immediatebenefits to Memry Corp. and its relatively unheraldedproducts. &quot;There's a great potential. There are 175 millionshowers out there,&quot; says Stephen Fisher, Memry's president.Company officials note that when Safe Kids focused on bicyclesafety last year, sales of bicycle helmets nearly doubled.   (Memry's last moment in the spotlight was considerablyless pleasant. In 1988, the company, then called MemoryMetals Inc., settled Securities and Exchange Commissioncharges that it had issued misleading news releases whileunder different management. Earlier, the company had been thetarget of a stock manipulation scheme.)   Memry is currently scrambling to open channels with suchmajor retailers as Wal-Mart and K mart. At the same time,it's trying to interest large plumbing fixture companies indesigning safety faucets around the core of its product -- ametal alloy spring that rapidly expands to shut off the waterflow as temperatures approach 120 degrees and then returns toits original shape as temperatures drop.   One criticism of the safety promotion is that it ispromoting one company's product. Earlier this year, Safe Kidsappeared before the Council of American Building Officials,which issues a model national building code for one and twofamily dwellings, to request a code amendment that wouldrequire showers and tubs in new construction to include &quot;apoint of use temperature sensing device&quot; that shuts off waterflow at 120 degrees. But the council rejected the request, inpart because of concerns that only the Memry productsatisfies that definition. Safe Kids will make anotherappearance before the group later this year and seek similaramendments from other code-drafting bodies.   Both Safe Kids and Memry acknowledge that the company hascontributed to the anti-scald campaign. But Mr. Kamela saysthis hasn't influenced the organization. &quot;We have a $2million budget. They contributed $15,000,&quot; he says. Safe Kidswas established by the Children's National Medical Center inWashington, and receives most of its funds from Johnson andamp;Johnson.   Over the past decade, some concerned doctors and publichealth officials around the country have fought with mixedsuccess to persuade people to turn down their hot waterheaters and to win laws requiring hot water heatermanufacturers to set temperatures lower.   For years, water-heater makers and plumbers had generallyset water heaters at 140 degrees or higher. At 140 degrees,water can give a child third-degree burns in three secondsand scald an adult in five seconds, according to MurrayKatcher, the director of maternal and child health in theWisconsin Division of Health. The risk of scalding declinessharply with water temperatures. &quot;Generally, in the 120-130range, people are safe,&quot; Dr. Katcher says.   In 1988, after Wisconsin and several other states passedlaws requiring water heater settings at 120 or 125 degrees,the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, a group thatrepresents makers of both gas and electric water heaters,agreed to recommend settings of 120 degrees and to put scaldwarning labels on all heaters. But because only about 10% ofthe nation's water heaters are replaced each year, most wateris still too hot, Dr. Katcher says.   Thus, anti-scald groups are pushing safety valves.&quot;Education isn't nearly as successful as a passive means ofprevention,&quot; Dr. Katcher explains.</TEXT></DOC>
