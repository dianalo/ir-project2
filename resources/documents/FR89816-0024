This will facilitate program operations.The proposed rule would also authorize an increase in expenditures forthe California Olive Committee established under Marketing Order No. 932for the 1989 fiscal year. This increase is needed to cover increased productionresearch costs.

These orders are effective under the AgriculturalMarketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafterreferred to as the Act.This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein.Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act(RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) hasconsidered the economic impact of this proposed rule on small entities.The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximatley 72 handlers of fresh Bartlett pears and seven handlersof California olives regulated under their respective marketing orders,and approximately 1,390 olive producers in California and 1,900 Bartlettpear producers in Washington and Oregon. Small agricultural producers havebeen defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.2] as thosehaving annual gross revenues for the last three years of less than $500,000,and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose gross annualreceipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of the handlers and producersof Bartlett pears may be classified as small entities. Most, but not all,of the olive producers and none of the olive handlers may be classifedas small entities.Each marketing order administered by the Department of Agriculture (Department)requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year shall applyto all assessable commodities handled from the beginning of such year.An annual budget of expenses is prepared by each administrative committeeand submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the administrativecommittees are handlers and producers of the regulated commodities. Theyare familiar with the committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services,and personnel in their local areas, and are thus in a position to formulateappropriate budgets. The budgets are formulated and discussed in publicmeetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participateand provide input.The assessment rate recommended by each committee is derived by dividingthe anticipated expenses by the expected shipments of the commodity (i.e.,pounds, tons, boxes, cartons, etc.). Because that rate is applied to actualshipments, it must be established at a rate which will produce sufficientincome to pay the committees' expected expenses. Recommended budgets andrates of assessment are usually acted upon by the committees before a seasonstarts, and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, budgetand assessment rate approvals must be expedited so that the committeeswill have funds to pay their expenses.The Northwest Fresh Bartlett Pear Marketing Committee met July 10, 1989,and unanimously recommeded 1989-90 fiscal period expenditures of $81,386and an assessment rate of $0.015 per standard box or equivalent of assessablepears shipped under M.O. 931. In comparison, 1988-89 fiscal period budgetedexpenditures were $53,800 and the assessment rate was the same as recommendedfor the 1989-90 fiscal period. These expenditures are primarily for programadministration. The increase in the budget from 1988-89 is due to a $7,980increase in salaries and a $15,451 increase in contingencies for unexpectedexpenditures. Other budget categories were increased or decreased slightly.Assessment income for the 1989-90 fiscal period is expected to total $38,758based on the shipment of 2,583,855 packed boxes of pears at $0.015 perstandard box or equivalent. Other available funds include a reserve of$40,628 carried into this fiscal period, and $2,000 in miscellaneous income,primarily from interest bearing accounts. The reserve is within the limitsauthorized under the marketing order. A final rule establishing expenses in the amount of $1,883,290 for theCalifornia Olive Committee for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1989,was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 6, 1989 [54 FR 5585]. That actionalso fixed an assessment rate of $25.39 per ton of assessable olives receivedby handlers under M.O. 932 during the 1989 fiscal year. At a meeting held on July 11, 1989, the California Olive Committee votedunanimously to increase its budget of expenses from $1,883,290 to $1,902,322.The proposed $19,032 increase is needed to cover increased production researchcosts and the cost of printing and disseminating the results of a completedresearch project. No change in the assessment rate was recommended by the olive committee.Adequate funds are available to cover the increase in expenses proposedby this action. While the expenses and assessment rate authorized underM.O. 931 and the increase in expenses authorized under M.O. 932 would imposesome additional costs on Bartlett pear and olive handlers, the costs arein the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additionalcosts may be passed on to producers. However, these costs would be significantlyoffset by the benefits derived from the operatioin of the marketing orders.Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that these actionswould not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. Based on the foregoing, it is found and determined that a comment periodof less than 30 days is appropriate because approval of the budget andassessment rate for the pear program and the budget increase for the oliveprogram need to be expedited. The committees need to have sufficient fundsto pay their expenses, which are incurred on a continuous basis. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>7 CFR Part 931 Marketing agreements and orders, Bartlett pears, Oregon, and Washington.7 CFR Part 932 Marketing agreements and orders, olives, California.
