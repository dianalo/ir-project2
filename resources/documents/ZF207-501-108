 Other individuals who are not computerprofessionals face the same problems as described here.andP;  In addition, werestrict the report to list countries where there are known violations inwhich computer professionals have been involved.andP;  It is likely that there arecountries, not listed here, in which computer professionals have had theirrights violated.andP;  Although the report lists abuses in particular countries,these countries are not necessarily the worst abusers of human rights: theyhave been cited because they have abused the rights of computerprofessionals.andM;In the second report published by this editor, it was stated that,andM;&quot;Violations of the human rights of computer professionals have increased andhave become harsher since our last report.&quot;andM;In the third report it was stated that,andM;&quot;It is regrettable that, in the main, this is still true for this report.&quot;andM;Now, for the first time we can say that significant progress has been made inadvancing the human rights of computer professionals.andP;  The rights of many ofthe individuals whose scientific freedom and/or human rights had beenviolated have been restored.andP;  There remains, however, a significant number ofcomputer professionals whose human rights are still violated, necessitatingour continuing to report about them and to support them.andM;In our third report we listed 185 computer professionals whose human rightshad been violated.andP;  There has been substantial progress on the restoration ofthe rights of these individuals.andP;  All 45 Polish citizens we listed have beenreleased from jail.andP;  In addition, Jan Borowiec, not included in our list, wasjailed in the interim and subsequently released.andP;  Of the 134 Soviet citizenslisted, 73 have been released from prison or emigrated.andP;  One Soviet citizendecided to withdraw his application for an exit visa and one computerprofessional was released from exile and does not wish to emigrate.andO;Tragically, however, one computer professional died in prison.andM;In this report we list 144 computer professionals whose human rights havebeen denied: two in Argentina, one in the People's Republic of China, two inCzechoslovakia, one in Israel, one in Iran, one in Kenya, four in SouthAfrica and 132 in the Soviet Union.andP;  While 51 listed in the last report werein jail, only 1 or possibly 2 are now imprisoned.andP;  One in the People'sRepublic of China, one in Kenya (who was just released from jail) and one inthe Soviet Union who may have been released by the time this report ispublished.andP;  In addition, there is one who is in internal exile in the SovietUnion.andP;  Tragically, one of the South Africans was killed by the South AfricanDefense Forces in a raid on Garborone in 1987; the current status of theother three is unknown.andP;  While this current list shows 30 fewer individualsthan listed previously, this should not be seen as a material change for thebetter in the human rights of computer professionals.andP;  It does indicate apositive direction on human rights in the Soviet Union.andM;We are pleased to note that our reports and letters in support of ourcolleagues have had a positive impact in improving the conditions for some ofour members and in significantly raising their morale.andP;  In a letter sent tothe Forum column that appeared in the July 1987 issue of Communications, oneof our Polish colleagues, Jan Borowiec, who was not listed in the previousreport, but for whom the CSFHR wrote letters of support to the Polishgovernment, wrote:andM;&quot;I wish to thank all of you, known to me and unknown, for your expressions ofconcern about my imprisonment and for your display of solidarity with mymisfortune.andP;  &quot;During all the long time of my solitude, between October 1985and September 1986, I had a permanent feeling of having friends around me whocared about my fate.andP;  That assurance was more than important to me.&quot;andM;Haim Kilov, who was given an exit visa from the Soviet Union, and now residesin the U.S., has informed us that the reports of this committee, published inCommunications, were instrumental in his not losing his job and ultimately inobtaining his release.andP;  He states that the publicity given to scientists bythe reports is extremely important.andP;  He wrote:andM;&quot;It is well-known that the Soviet society exists not in accordance with laws,but rather in accordance with secret instructions.andP;  Some of the Sovietofficials were sincere enough to acknowledge this fact.andP;  And even more--theKGB men, the OVIR people, and even the managers on our workplace wererepeating: 'You are unknown to anyone in the West.andP;  Nobody is interested inyou.andP;  And therefore we'll be able to do whatever we want, and forget aboutthe laws: they are not for you.andP;  They are for Western liberals, to show themthat our society is the most democratic one in the world.'andM;&quot;Imagine what happened when my name appeared in the ACM report signed by JackMinker.andP;  And more--when Daniel McCracken had published his ACM President'sletter about myself in the Communications of the ACM.andP;  The Soviet authoritiessuddenly changed their attitude; we were even able to get our mail! ...andO;Publicity is the least thing they want ....andP;  So, eventually both I and mywife could work as professionals, and I could even publish my papers.&quot;andM;A letter to the government of Romania from the CSFHR, and that government'sconcern about most favored nation trading rights contributed to the releaseof Maria-Ana Necula, whose husband was already in the U.S.andM;In this report we generally review on a country-by-country basis significantevents that have occurred since our last report.andP;  As noted earlier, there areprobably additional countries where violations of rights of computerscientists exist.andP;  However, we have been unable to obtain information oncountries other than those listed here.andP;  Two countries, listed in ourprevious report, Pakistan and Turkey, do not appear here because we havereceived no reports of abuses directed against computer professionals there.andO;As reported in Communications of September 1985 (Volume 28, Number 9), 10Turkish computer professionals were listed erroneously.andP;  The Turkishindividuals listed in that report had not had their human rights violated.andO;The source of the information was an article published in the February 1984issue of the Turkish monthly Bilim ve Sanat (Science and Art, pp.andP;  26-32)which was sent to us by a member of the Clearinghouse on Science and HumanRights of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.andP;  In theabove cited issue of Communications we corrected the error.andP;  We againapologize to our colleagues who were listed in error.andP;  We sincerely regretany embarassment that may have been caused to them.andP;  Information concerninghuman rights in Turkey, in general, was reported accurately in the thirdreport with the exception of the names of the specific individuals.andM;Argentina.andP;  Repression in Argentina has been ended.andP;  This is due to theaccession of a democratic regime under President Raul Alfonsin.andP;  His statedpolicy is to admit the repressive acts of the previous military regime and toimprove the human rights of all citizens of Argentina.andP;  Unfortunately, thestatus of our disappeared colleagues, Robert Ardito and Hilda Graciela Leikisde Alvarez Rojas is still unknown.andP;  Shortly after the new government wasinstalled and its humane policy became apparent, a letter was sent by thiseditor to the Argentinian Ambassador to the U.S.andP;  to inquire about thewhereabouts of our two colleagues.andP;  No response has been received from theAmbassador and one can only assume that they were murdered together withcountless other Argentinian citizens.andP;  This will be the last time that welist them in our reports.andM;People's Republic of China.andP;  During the period of &quot;cultural revolution,&quot; mostcomputer professionals in China had their human rights abrogated.andP;  However,although the situation of computer professionals improved, there is currentlya computer professional from Hong Kong imprisoned in the People's Republic ofChina for political reasons.andM;Czechoslovakia.andP;  In our last report we stated that Vaclav Benda and Ivan M.andO;Havel were released.andP;  A visitor to Czechoslovakia last year reported thatHavel was not permitted to work in the government.andP;  As this is the only realemployment possibility for a computer professional in Czechoslovakia, he isin effect denied any gainful employment.andP;  Havel received a Ph.D.andP;  in computerscience from the University of California at Berkeley.andP;  He is clearly aqualified computer professional.andP;   Although we have no direct information asto whether or not Benda is permitted to work, based on the informationconcerning Havel, we are listing both of them as victims of scientificfreedom and human rights abuse.andM;Iran.andP;  The status of the human rights of individuals in Iran has, in general,been poor.andP;  Shahram Gharaie-Nejad, an Iranian citizen and member of the ACM,wrote to this editor that he was arrested in August 1981 and placed in a cellfor 48 days without being given a reason for his arrest.andP;  He was then urgedto convert to Islam.andP;  When he resisted he received a four-minute trial andwas condemned to 10 years imprisonment.andP;  His crime was his adherence to theBaha'i faith.andM;He states that he spent one-and-one-half years in Band 4 of 'Adelabad Prisonof Shiraz' and frequently observed torture and execution of politicalprisoners.andP;  Finally, after 18 months of unbearable conditions, he agreed toconvert to Islam and was released in February 1983.andM;Because of his participation in the Baha'i burial ceremonies for his father,the Revolutionary Guards again came to his family home in September 1985.andO;When they did not find him at home, they arrested his brother.andP;  He was thenadvised to hide and to leave the country.andP;  After four months of hiding, hefled through the mountains by horse and by foot to Turkey.andP;  He is now workingas a programmer in the West.andM;Escaped Iranian Whose Human Rights Are NoandM;Longer Violated:andM;Shahram Gharaie-NejadandM;Israel.andP;  This nation currently occupies a territory referred to as the WestBank.andP;  There has been a report that a computer professional, Munther Salah,the President of An-Najah University, a West Bank University in the city ofNablus, left the West Bank to conduct educational business in Amman, Jordan,on September 12, 1986.andP;  On September 18 he received the required return visapermit which would allow him to re-enter the West Bank.andP;  On September 21 hetried to re-enter the West Bank and was denied entry.andP;  According to anIsraeli official quoted in the Palestinian weekly, Al-Fajr (September 26,1986), Salah, &quot;violated the terms of his work permit by engaging innonacademic activities.&quot;andM;The material concerning Salah was made available to us by the AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).andP;  In following up on thiscase, the AAAS wrote to the Israeli Ambassador in Washington, D.C.andP;  on July19, 1988 and requested information on Salah, writing:andM;&quot;The Committee recently has learned that Dr. Munther Salah, president ofAn-Najah University, has been in exile in Amman, Jordan, since September1986.andP;  While Dr. Salah was on a short trip to Amman, his work permits werecanceled, and he was subsequently refused permission to return to the WestBank.andP;  It is not clear that any proceedings were held or any charges madepublic before this action was taken.andM;&quot;We respectfully request any information you may be able to provide on thereasons for the cancellation of Dr. Salah's work and residency permits andthe legal recourses available to residents of the West Bank who have beenexiled or deported.&quot;andM;In response to this inquiry, the Minister-Counselor of the Embassy of Israelwrote, on August 2, 1988:andM;&quot;The facts of the matter are as follows: Dr. Salah was president of theAn-Najah University until September 1986.andP;  His working permit was notextended due to his ties to inciting and hostile elements at the University.andO;Dr. Salah assisted, together with others, in causing the disturbances thatplagued that university in the course of 1986.andM;&quot;As for the legal procedures, the regional authorities have the right tocancel residency permits as well as working permits.andP;  Dr. Salah, has the fullrights to appeal on this decision to the High Court of Appeals.andP;  Hisattorneys are empowered to do it on his behalf as well.andP;  Up until now, Dr.andO;Salah did not avail himself of these legal proceedings.&quot;andM;As this case was complicated, and we were unable to come to a judgement ofwhether or not this constituted a violation of Salah's human rights, weprovided all of the information available to us to the Lawyer's Committee forHuman Rights and asked them if they could give us a legal opinion.andP;  Afterreviewing the material and making several phone inquiries concerning thecase, the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights wrote, on August 8, 1988:andM;&quot;It is not possible for us to assess whether Dr. Salah's treatment was infact a violation of his human rights without additional facts on hisbackground and specific circumstances.&quot;andM;The AAAS, who originally supplied us with the information, stated, on June30, 1988,andM;&quot;In your report on computer scientists, you may wish to note Dr. Salah's caseas background and not specifically state that his human rights have beenviolated.andP;  We would prefer to get more information on this case before makinga judgement on its merits as a rights abuse case.&quot;andM;In view of the difficulties in finding the precise facts of the case, we havedecided to present all of the information available to us in the body of thisreport and also specifically cite Salah in the list of individuals whosehuman rights have been violated.andP;  If additional information is received whichindicates otherwise, we will inform the membership.andM;Kenya.andP;  One computer professional is listed as having his human rightsviolated.andP;  While this report was being finalized for publication we learnedthat Kariuki Gathitu was released from prison on February 3, 1988.andP;  Accordingto Amnesty International, 10 people were detained in Kenya for an indefiniteperiod without charge or trial under Public Security (Detained and RestrictedPersons) Regulations, 1978, made under the Preservation of Public SecurityAct.andP;  They were arrested on political grounds and were in most, or all,cases, held illegally, in excess of the 24-hour limit, before formaldetention orders under Public Security Regulations were issued.andP;  There is nolegal provision for holding suspects beyond 24 hours, without bringing themto court, other than under an administrative detention order under PublicSecurity Regulations.andP;  Most of the individuals were released on February 5,1988.andP;  Three individuals who had filed complaints about their detention werenot released.andP;  Poland.andP;  In the last report we stated,andM;&quot;There is a dramatic increase in the number of computer professionals whosehuman rights have been violated in Poland .... Poland now rivals the SovietUnion as the greatest violator of the human rights of computerprofessionals.&quot;andM;As noted, all of the computer professionals who were listed in our report areno longer in detention.andP;  Hence, there has been a dramatic improvement in thehuman rights of computer professionals in Poland since our last report.andO;Clemency was granted to scores of prisoners on September 11, 1986.andP;  Webelieve that either all, or most of those listed here, were released at aboutthat time.andM;The list of Polish computer professionals who have been released includesthose who appeared in our previous report and Jan Borowiec who was jailedsince our last report appeared.andP;  They are as follows: Released PolishComputer Professionals * Kazmierz Albinski * Stanislaw Bartkowski * JolatnaBoczkowskaandM;Jan Borowiec * Bogdan Busala * Jerzy Bulawa * Krzysztof Chmiel * KrzysztofChrystowski * Ludwik Dziwis * Dr. Ehrlich * Marcin Frybes * Sabina Gandecka *Pawel Gazdicki * Tadeusz Huskowski * Jack Jaworski * Zbigniew Karwowski *Teodor Klincewicz * Krystian Konik * Jacek Kowalski * Tomasz Kowalski *Krzysztof Kucharski * Tadeusz Kulczewski * Dariusz Kupiecki * KrzysztofLachowski * Josef Laskiewicz * Anatol Lawina * Jan Litynski * KrzysztofLorentz * Miroslaw Michalik * Zdzislaw Nowak * Wiktor Nagorski * KazimierzOblinski * Gregorz Parjaszewski * Marius Plencer * Marek Popliel * AleksandrRusiecki * Zbigniew Sarata * Zbigniew Stelmachowski * Elzbieta Stobbe *Zbigniew Swiatkowski * Wanda Szukiewicz * Henryk Tomecki * Konrad Turzynski *Andrzej Walny * Elzbieta Zabek * Elzbieta ZielinskaandM;Romania.andP;  We included one computer professional from Romania in the lastreport, but noted that he had been released.andP;  One computer professional fromRomania, not listed in our previous report, was denied an exit visa to rejoinher husband in the United States but subsequently received the exit visa.andO;Emigrated Romanian Computer Professional: Maria-Ana NeculaandM;It is of interest to consider the reasons that may have led to her receivingan exit visa, after being denied one by the Romanian government.andP;  The policyof the U.S., as voted by Congress, ties most favored nation trading status tothe country's performance on emigration.andP;  The congressman from the districtin New York City where Necula's husband resides wrote to the Romaniangovernment on her behalf, as did this committee.andM;South Africa.andP;  As this report was being prepared for publication we receivedword that four South Africans had their rights violated.andP;  These violationsoccurred in 1986.andP;  A letter to the ACM was sent on October 27, 1986 bySibusiso Sibisi, Scott Hazelhurst and Philip Machanick of the University ofWitwatersrand, Johannesburg, to detail the violations that had occurred.andP;  TheACM has no record that the letter was received from the University ofWitwatersrand concerning the human rights violations.andP;  Peter Denning receivedinformation in 1988 that Hazelhurst had written to the ACM.andP;  Denning informedBarbara Simons, chair of CSFHR, who relayed the information to this editorwho wrote to Hazelhurst in South Africa.andP;  Hazelhurst responded immediatelywith a copy of the letter sent to the ACM in 1986, but which was not receivedby them, and also provided additional information to this editor.andP;  Thematerial reported here is taken from the information supplied by Hazelhurst.andM;The computer professionals listed in this report were charged with certainviolations.andP;  One violation occurred based on Section 29 of the InternalSecurity Act which allows a senior police officer to order the arrest andindefinite detention without charge of any individual for the purpose ofinterrogation.andP;  The courts were excluded by the Act from enquiring into thevalidity of such an arrest.andM;A second violation occurred because of Emergency Regulation 3(1) promulgatedby the State President in terms of his powers under the Public Safety Actthat is far wider in terms of its reference.andP;  It empowers any member of theDefense Force, Police Force and Prisons Service to arrest and order thedetention for a period of 30 days of any person if he believes it to be inthe interest of public order, the safety of the public, the safety of theperson concerned or the termination of the State of Emergency.andP;  The courtsare excluded from judging the validity of an arrest under the State ofEmergency.andM;Uruguay.andP;  Neither the AAAS nor Amnesty International have been able to supplyinformation concerning Ademar Vinales who had been reported as jailed in ourlast report.andP;  There is, however, every reason to believe that he has beenreleased from jail and permitted to work in his chosen discipline.andP;  In March1985 a civilian government was elected in Uruguay.andP;  While there are no longergross violations of human rights, the main human rights issue now in Uruguayis a drive to repeal a law passed by the Uruguayan Congress in 1986 thatspecifies neither criminal nor civil proceedings may be brought by victims ortheir relatives against military personnel responsible for human rightsviolations during the 1973-1985 period of military rule.andM;Soviet Union.andP;  Based on our documentation, the largest number of computerprofessionals whose human rights are violated reside in the Soviet Union.andP;  Inour last report we stated,andM;&quot;In the time of the Czars, when a new leader came into power, amnesty wasgiven to many political prisoners.andP;  When Yuri Andropov succeeded Brezhnev,there was hope that there would be some sign that the Soviet Union would begenerous to their prisoners.andP;  The reality was, however, that greaterrepression was imposed by the government.andP;  Computer professionals whose humanrights had been violated were subjected to even harsher treatment as isevidenced by the cases of Anatoly Shcharansky, Iosif Begun, Vyakmin Bakhmin,Tatiyana Osipova, and others described in this report.andP;  The death of Mr.andO;Andropov has given the Soviet Union a further opportunity to provide amnestyto some of its political prisoners.andP;  As of the writing of this report, andwith the advent of the newly appointed Soviet leader, Konstantin Chernenko,it is unclear that this will happen.&quot;andM;With the accession of Mikhail Gorbachev, and his policy of glasnost(openness), there have been improvements with respect to human rights.andP;  Agood number of computer professionals were released from the Gulag, andothers were given exit visas.andP;  The number of political prisoners, bothcomputer professionals and others, has decreased significantly and manyreported as having been denied exist visas have now emigrated.andP;  Whilecrediting the Soviet Union with improvements, we note that many human rightsproblems have yet to be resolved.andM;In previous reports we highlighted the plight of several computerprofessionals.andP;  Among them were Anatoly Schcharansky, Irina Grivnina,Tatiyana Osipova, Iosif Begun, and Aleksandr Lerner.andP;  We are pleased toreport that they all have been given exit visas and have left the SovietUnion.andP;  Aleksandr Lerner, the senior refusenik scientist in the Soviet Union,who had been denied an exit visa for over 17 years, and who is now 74 yearsof age, was allowed to emigrate after President Reagan presented Mr.andO;Gorbachev with a short list of individuals with whom he was concerned at thesummit meeting in December, 1987.andM;We are saddened to report that on August 3, 1986, Mark Morozov, 55 years old,died, reportedly as a result of a heart attack he suffered while in Chistopolprison.andP;  We review his case in the upcoming detailed listing of individuals.andM;In early 1988, the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the National Academy ofScience of the United States agreed to the broadest accord on scientificcooperation in almost a decade.andP;  As reported in the New York Times on January13, 1988, Guri I. Marchuk, chairman of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, at anews conference following the signing, made a qualified prediction that themost troublesome remaining human rights issue for American scientists--theSoviet contention that some Jewish scientists can be denied emigrationbecause they possess undefined &quot;state secrets&quot;--is on the way to resolution.andM;The Times further stated,andM;&quot;Dr.andP;  Marchuk referred to 'negative dogmas' that he said 'once held sway inour society,' adding, 'We are in the process of breaking this up.'andM;&quot;You cannot at a stroke address all the issues there are,&quot; said Dr. Marchuk.andO;&quot;We are trying to do things stage by stage, a process which will practically,I am sure, result in the complete or nearly complete resolution of allcases.&quot;andM;This is a very constructive statement.andP;  We will send Marchuk a copy of thisreport so that he may be aware of the concerns that the ACM has for itscolleagues.andP;  We hope that he will positively address the problems of ourfellow computer professionals in accordance with his quoted statement.andP;  Inthis connection, the reader is referred to the case of Elias Pinskerdescribed later.andP;  Pinsker, who worked in Marchuk's Academy in Moscow, wasdenied an exit visa without having been given a cause.andP;  Pinsker has had noaccess to information that can be considered secret.andM;The list of individuals who have been released from prison or who have beengiven exit visas in the Soviet Union appears next.andP;  Several of those on thelist have been informed that they will receive exit visas, but as of thisreport they have not yet emigrated.andP;  These individuals are: ArnoldDinerstein, Vladimir Knokh and Vladimir (Zeev) Meshkov, who we list withthose who have received their exit visa under the assumption that they willemigrate shortly.andP;  The list of those who have been granted exit visas is asfollows: Soviet Computer Professionals Who Have Emigrated * Pavel Abramovich(NYT) * Solomon Alber (CCS/WCSJ) * Irina Alievskaya (BK) * Yuri Balovenkov(WP) * Iosif Begun (CCS) * Mikhail Beizer (WCSJ) * Iosif Berenshtein(CCS/WCSJ) * Benjamin Bogomolny (CCS/WCSJ) * Aleksandr Bolonkin (CL) * ViktorBrailovsky (CCS/WCSJ) * Veniamin Charny (CCS/WCSJ)andM;Arnold Dinerstein (WCSJ) * Elena Edel (WCSJ) * Michael A.

 Itwould appear that, in many instances, they are not permitted to work ascomputer professionals.andP;  In addition, individuals who request exit visas aregenerally dismissed from their jobs.andP;  Both of these are human rightsviolations.andP;  This is highlighted in the following review of the case ofTatiyana Velikanova.andM;Velikanova, listed in all of our previous reports, has been released fromexile.andP;  Although technically her human rights are not now violated, wediscuss her case here because she has decided to remain in exile.andM;Velikanova was born on February 3, 1932.andP;  She has a son, Feodor.andP;  She wasarrested in 1979 and sentenced to 4 years strict regime camp plus five yearsexile.andP;  She was convicted of &quot;anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.&quot;andP;  She wasa founding member of the movement for civil, religious, and national rightsin the Soviet Union and a member of the Helsinki Monitoring Group.andM;In January 1987 it was learned that Velikanova, who was in exile in Beineu(in the Mangyshlak region, Kazadh SSR) was threatened with criminalproceedings for &quot;parasitism.&quot;andP;  She was denied permission to work as acomputer programmer, and then charged with parasitism.andP;  Since the governmentis the employer in the Soviet Union, and although she had the capabilities tocontinue in the computer profession, she had no opportunity to work in herprofession.andP;  In the Soviet Union, a parasite is one who is eligible to work,but has no job.andP;  She was eligible to receive a pension (at the age of 55) onFebruary 3, 1987.andP;  Relatives of Velikanova (in answer to their appeal, andsupport from other organizations, including this committee) were informed bythe procuracy that criminal proceedings for parasitism would not beinstituted against her.andP;  On January 4, 1987, an article concerning the Fundto Aid Political Prisoners appeared in the Lithuanian newspaper TIESA,containing, in particular, attacks on Velikanova.andM;She was released recently following a decree granting her pardon at thebeginning of December 1987.andP;  However, she refused to accept the passport andpardon offered to her, but was demanding rehabilitation.andP;  She is voluntarilyremaining in exile until the end of her sentence (or until she isrehabilitated).andP;

 Joan Dodek and Ruth Newman of the Washington Committee onSoviet Jewry were particularly helpful in obtaining the expanded list ofindividuals from the Soviet Union that appears here.andP;  Jane Cave, KariHannibal and Janet Gruschow of the American Association for the Advancementof Science's Office of Scientific Freedom and Responsibility providedvaluable material on the People's Republic of China, Israel, Kenya, and theSoviet Union.andP;  They also reviewed the report and commented on it.andP;  CarolCorillon of the Committee on Human Rights of the National Academy of Sciencesmade useful comments that have been incorporated into the report.andP;  We alsoowe a great debt to Cronid Lubarsky, Publisher of the USSR News Brief, areport that lists all known human rights violations that take place in theSoviet Union.andP;  His cooperation is, once again, gratefully acknowledged.andO;Finally, Anthony Ralston, and Daniel McCracken, members of my subcommittee,and Barbara Simons all reviewed and commented on the report.andP;  I particularlywant to express my appreciation to Anthony Ralston for the excellent counseland support that he had given me on each of the four reports on human rightsthat I have published.andP;  Ralston and Dan McCracken have been especiallyhelpful and supportive with this report and I am indebted to them.andM;Additional sources of information from which this report was drawn comesfrom: The Committee in Support of Solidarity; The Commission on Security andCooperation in Europe; Rachelle Heller; The Helsinki Watch Committee; TheIsrael Public Council for Soviet Jewry; National Conference on Soviet Jewry;Nature magazine; Science magazine; the Washington Post; and the WashingtonJewish Week.andM;Dissent to the Publication of this ReportandM;We, the undersigned members of the Scientific Freedom and Human RightsCommittee, dissent from the decision to publish this report as an officialstatement by ACM.andP;  We dissent because we believe that the report conveys amisleading impression of the state of human rights in the world, and that thedata in the report has not been adequately substantiated.andM;Of the 144 individuals cited, 132 are in the Soviet Union.andP;  Most of thoseappear to be Soviet Jews.andP;  We question whether the actual distribution ofviolations of human rights throughout the world is reflected in thesestatistics.andP;  Although the report does not make any statement about humanrights in general, and indeed in its introduction states that the countrieslisted are not necessarily the worst abusers of human rights, it isinevitable that the inference will be drawn.andP;  With respect to the humanrights of computer professionals in particular, we are simply not convincedthat the report paints a fair picture.andP;  As we argue below, the subcommitteemust bear the burden of proof that the picture is fair.andM;By choosing to concentrate most of its attention on just one group, thesubcommittee has failed in its responsibility to produce a fair,dispassionate, and balanced report.andP;  Members of the subcommittee argue thatwe, the dissenters, have not provided them with evidence of other violations.andO;But it is the subcommittee's responsibility, not ours, to seek out evidencewherever it is to be found, just as it is the responsibility of the author ofa technical article, not its critics, to locate the important citations ofrelevant work.andP;  For example, if the subcommittee has sought out human rightsviolations pertaining to non-Jewish Soviet computer professionals, orviolations occurring in the U.S.andP;  (denial of employment to whistle-blowersand openly gay people being possible examples), it offers no evidence of it.andO;The heavy reliance of the subcommittee on various Soviet Jewry committees fortheir information (at least 107 citations have no other source) reinforcesour contention.andM;For most of the individual citations, the report says little about how theywere obtained and validated, except to name the organizations and individualsthat were the sources of information.andP;  If any of the subcommittee membershave first-hand knowledge that would support the citations, it is with fewexceptions not stated in the report.andP;  If attempts were made to verify thecitations by contacting either the individuals or governments named, thereport does not generally document them.andM;The problem of inadequate investigation is particularly troublesome becauseof what happened with the Third ACM Report on the Scientific Freedom andHuman Rights of Computer Professionals, published in January, 1985.andP;  Two ofthe members of the subcommittee, Anthony Ralston and Jack Minker, werechairman and vice-chairman respectively on the Scientific Freedom and HumanRights Committee when the previous report was issued.andM;The previous report cited violations of the rights of certain Turkishcomputer professionals.andP;  After the report was published, several of themwrote to ACM complaining that their rights had not in fact been violated.andO;One of them went so far as to argue that the publication of the report was initself a violation of his rights.andP;  These letters appeared in the ACM Forumsection of the September, 1985 and December, 1985 issues of Communications.andO;Here are some pertinent quotes:andM;Yuksel Uckan: &quot;As an ACM member, I fully support your concern for the mattersof scientific freedom and human rights.andP;  However, I was sorry to see such animportant issue presented in a poorly researched and inaccurate article inCommunications....andP;  My scientific freedom and human rights were neverviolated during my tenure at METU or due to my voluntary resignation from myposition there.&quot;andM;Niyazi F. Akan: &quot;The editor has unfortunately listed my name under the listof those Turkish computer professionals whose human rights have been violatedwithout first ascertaining the facts....andP;  I request that ...andP;  you retract theerroneous information in your article, and that you indicate the sources ofyour article so that one may ascertain the perspective from which it waswritten.&quot;andM;Halil Basoglu: &quot;I was surprised that ACM would publish such a controversialdocument without any attempts to verify any of its contents....andP;  The sectionon Turkey contains hardly any truth.&quot;andM;Ismet Gungor: &quot;An organization that has declared itself the defendant ofscientific freedom and human rights should be very careful in handling thecases it publicizes....andP;  In my opinion, the ACM Committee on ScientificFreedom and Human Rights has not handled properly the case of the Turkishcomputer professionals listed in the 1984 report....andP;  The committee shouldhave at least tried to have the information contained in the report verifiedby the people publicized in the report....andP;  I hope the [Committee] will findways to compensate for the grave errors contained in the report and will takethe necessary measures to prevent similar errors in the future.&quot;andM;It should be pointed out that when these letters were written, Uckan wasresiding in the United States and Akan and Gungor were residing in Belgium.andO;Thus, it does not seem likely that the letters were written under duress.andM;Our aim is not to dredge up the past but to argue that in light of previousexperience, the burden of credibility for the report falls to its authors,not to its critics.andP;   Information obtained from other sources is notnecessarily correct; and if it is literally correct it can still bemisleading.andP;  We are particularly concerned that the subcommittee has notstated how it evaluated the significance and reliability of the informationobtained from its external sources, which are organizations whose missionsare very different from ACM's and individuals who in view of their pastmistreatment can hardly be expected to maintain their detachment.andP;  We do notwish to disparage these other organizations, most of which we are personallysympathetic to, nor to play down the suffering of those victims of humanrights abuses who are now in a position to provide information to thesubcommittee.andP;  But it is not reasonable to expect such passionate advocatesto produce impartial evaluations of the individual cases, nor to activelyseek out evidence that might indicate that the government involved is nottotally at fault.andM;Of the 144 Soviets cited, 102 are listed because they were denied exit visas.andO;No other information is given.andP;  The question of whether denial of an exitvisa per se is a human rights violation is not as simple as it may seem.andO;Although denial of employment as a result of seeking a visa is a human rightsviolation, it is not in most cases documented in the report except by ageneral assertion that it often occurs.andM;We question whether ACM should automatically support the point of view thatevery scientist in the world has an inalienable human right to leave his orher country, even though the scientist may have received costly and scarceeducation in the home country.andP;  In many cases, including the U.S.andP;  Army, sucheducation must be paid back by mandatory work.andP;  The loss of its most able andskilled citizens is a serious problem for many nations.andP;  Moreover, theconcern of the Soviet government over scientists leaving the country inpossession of critical military secrets is a valid one even though it isprobably overstated in most cases.andM;With respect to the individuals in the Soviet Union, we also raise thequestion of how many of them are computer professionals.andP;  For 23 of theindividuals, no occupation is listed.andP;  The report asserts that &quot;there isreason to believe&quot; that these individuals have worked in computer-relatedpositions, but offers no evidence to support that belief and in our opinionstretches a point by equating &quot;computer professional&quot; with &quot;a person workingin a computer-related position.&quot;andP;  Since the report is restricted to computerprofessionals whose human rights have been violated, and indeed is restrictedto that scope by the charter of the Scientific Freedom and Human RightsCommittee, we find this a serious flaw in the report.andM;For the reasons we have stated we believe that this report should not havebeen published by ACM.andP;  We disassociate ourselves from it.andM;Response to the Dissent to the Publication of this ReportandM;We are two members of the subcommittee of the Committee on Scientific Freedomand Human Rights (CSFHR) which is responsible for the report, &quot;ComputerProfessionals and Scientific Freedom and Human Rights.&quot;andP;  Since this report,like its predecessors, is wholly the work of the third member of thesubcommittee, Jack Minker, and since the brunt of the dissent is an attack onthe scholarship which led to the report, we think it appropriate that werespond to the dissent.andM;We deal first with the point that &quot;of the 155 individuals cited, 144 are inthe Soviet Union&quot; and that most of these &quot;appear to be Soviet Jews.&quot;andP;  TheSoviet Union has a far larger number of computer professionals than all theother countries of the world where widespread violations of scientificfreedom or human rights may have occurred.andP;  In addition, sources ofinformation about violations in the Soviet Union have been more readilyavailable for many years than for other parts of the world.andP;  It is true thatmost of the Soviet computer professionals whose human rights or scientificfreedom have been violated are Jews and that many Jewish organizations havetaken up their cause.andP;  But so what as far as this report is concerned?andP;  Thedissenters seem to imply that, because so many of those listed are Jews, thereport does not present a true picture about those of our colleagues for whominformation is available.andP;  This is a non sequitur and it is also nonsense.andM;The dissenters say that the &quot;burden of proof&quot; is on the subcommittee that&quot;the picture is fair.&quot;andP;  But what does this mean? The CSFHR is an ACMcommittee with virtually no resources of its own.andP;  If not for the herculeanand completely unsupported efforts of Minker, there would be no report atall.andP;  His efforts on previous versions of this report were recognized by anACM Outstanding Contribution Award in 1985.andP;  The burden of proof is only thatall available data has been assiduously sought and reported without bias.andP;  Ithas been.andP;  The point is not that the dissenters &quot;have not provided us withevidence of other violations&quot; but rather that no one--repeat no one--hassuggested where such violations might have been sought but were not.andP;  This isnot, as the dissenters claim, &quot;an official statement by ACM&quot; but only thereport of a committee.andP;  None of the predecessor reports have been interpretedas an ACM &quot;position&quot; on anything and this one will not be either.andM;The most disturbing and unfair aspect of the dissent is the suggestion thatMinker's data gathering has been slipshod or incomplete or biased.andP;  Inparticular, we find the suggestion that the subcommittee has sought outviolations pertaining only to Soviet Jewish computer professionals to becontemptible.andP;  It should be enough that the predecessor reports have beenwidely praised not just by human rights groups but by individuals whose nameshave appeared in it and by their colleagues and families.andP;  From the family ofArgentinians, a plea to continue the efforts; from Polish colleagues,appreciation for ACM's work; from Rumanians and Russians who have emigrated,thanks for our help.andP;  We know that Minker has not only been meticulous in hisefforts to find all available information but that he has also checked itsaccuracy to the extent possible.andP;  Moreover, he has been absolutely unbiasedin his attempts to root out information on violations of scientific freedomand human rights anywhere and everywhere.andP;  To even hint at the contrarydisgusts us and is a grave injustice to an ACM volunteer who has given freelyand prodigally of his time.andM;One-third of the dissent focuses on the only error in these reports which hasbeen discovered in the decade since Minker first began compiling them.andP;  Oneof the most remarkable things about these reports is that only one error hasbeen found, given the difficulty of finding the data and verifying it.andO;Minker has a justified reputation for accuracy in human rights circles.andP;  Thedissenters, it seems, would like a guarantee of accuracy before anything ispublished.andP;  But gathering data on human rights and scientific freedom is notan exercise of the scientific method.andP;  The suggestion that it should be is aprescription for inaction and bespeaks insensitivity toward these issuesgenerally.andP;  So, too, is the suggestion that a report that is not complete andcomprehensive should not be published.andP;  We believe it is essential to publishthe information that is available.andP;  To argue otherwise is analogous to nothelping a neighbor whose house is on fire on the grounds that there might beother fires elsewhere that you don't know about.andM;The dissenters object to the denial of a right to emigrate as a sign of aviolation of human rights.andP;  We will not argue here whether or not adeveloping country has a right to so deny an exit visa to a valued citizenwhose education has been paid for by the state.andP;  No person listed in thisreport is in this category.andP;  The dissenters' concern about the loss of acountry's &quot;most able and skilled citizens&quot; might be reasonable in some casesbut it is ludicrous to make this argument about the Soviet Union which eachyear graduates far more scientists and engineers per capita than the U.S.andP;  Ifthe dissenters do not know that it is almost axiomatic that a request for anexit visa in the Soviet Union has led to dismissal or demotion, they should.andO;And their concern about the possession of &quot;critical military secrets&quot; ofcitizens desiring to leave the Soviet Union is a tribute to the effectivenessof Soviet propaganda.andP;  Such claims have been routinely made by the Sovietsabout people whose knowledge of military secrets, if they ever had any, isclearly of no value any longer.andP;  We are convinced that not one person on ourlist has secret knowledge of any value since none has had any contact withclassified information for at least five years.andM;This report has been by far the most important activity of the Committee onScientific Freedom and Human Rights since it was established in 1980.andP;  Allprevious versions have been unanimously supported by the CSFHR.andP;  Not only isthe report immensely valuable in itself but it serves to humanize the overlytechnocratic image which ACM too often projects.andP;  We urge all ACM members topublicize this report and to get active themselves in the frustrating butultimately fulfilling activity of supporting the scientific freedom and humanrights of your colleagues.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
