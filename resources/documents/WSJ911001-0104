Three major reports show that the academic performance ofstudents improved in the 1980s, a period of widespreadeducation reform efforts. But the progress merely broughtstudent achievement back to the levels of the early 1970s.And when academic attainment is measured against whatstudents ought to know, it's woefully short.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;What we knew in 1970 is not nearly good enough for 1990,&quot;says Education Secretary Lamar Alexander. &quot;The gap betweenwhat we know and what we need to know in 1990 is so largethat it's almost a shocking gap.&quot;   While average math scores rose during the 1980s, fewerthan one in five of fourth, eighth and 12th graders today is&quot;competent&quot; in mathematics, according to a report by theNational Education Goals Panel, which was formed to measureprogress toward the six goals drawn up by President Bush andthe 50 governors nearly two years ago.   By the panel's standards, that means that only 18% of U.S.eighth graders can solve problems with decimals, fractionsand proportion; classify geometric figures; read, interpretand construct line and circle graphs; and translate verbalproblems into simple algebraic expressions. The other 82%can't.   Yesterday's report was the first attempt by the goalspanel to assess where the nation stands in the drive to reachthe education goals, which promise by 2000 that all U.S.students will start school &quot;ready to learn&quot;; high schoolgraduation rates will reach 90%; students will leave thefourth, eighth and 12th grades with &quot;competency&quot; in math,science, history and geography; U.S. students will be &quot;firstin the world&quot; in math and science; every adult American willbe literate and possess the skills and knowledge to competein a global economy; and every U.S. school will be free ofdrugs and violence.   Math was the main focus of the reports. The goals panelsaid it's working on developing standards of &quot;competency&quot; forthe other major subjects.   Another study, by the National Assessment Governing Board,found that more than one-third of fourth, eighth and 12thgraders are failing to reach even basic competence in math.This was the first time the board-composed of educators andstate, federal, and local officials -- took test results andattempted to assess how acceptable average scores are. Itwill do the same for reading, writing, science and geographyin the next three years.   According to the board's findings, more than one-third ofthe students tested fail to reach a basic achievement level.The highest of the three levels was reached by only 0.6% offourth graders, 1% of eighth graders and 2.6% of 12thgraders.   The reports reflect a new course in education debate andassessment in this country. &quot;We now have a nation that isdiscussing standards-based education,&quot; says Gov. Roy Romer ofColorado, a Democrat who's former chairman of the goalspanel. Indeed, while the education debate in past years hasfocused on trends, and comparisons among states anddistricts, the new aim is to look at how U.S. childrenmeasure up to what they should know to be educated,functioning citizens of the world.   To that end, the administration has proposed a nationaltesting system to see how U.S. students compare. But the ideais controversial among many educators, who argue that thefocus ought to be on how to improve students' learning, noton measuring their shortcomings.   Members of Congress were notably absent from the array ofgovernors, educators and administration officials thatgathered to present the national goals report. Democraticmembers of Congress have long complained that they have beenexcluded from positions of influence on the goals panel,whose voting members are six governors -- three Democrats andthree Republicans -- and four members of the administration.The House and Senate leaders in both parties also sit on thepanel but can't vote.   &quot;While I agree with most of the report's conclusions . . .I think it's unfortunate the report is not more bipartisan,&quot;said House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said a luncheonwith reporters. &quot;But the White House took pains to structureit in a way that gave an overwhelming Republican character tothe commission.&quot;   Not all of the data was dismal. Results released by theNational Assessment of Educational Progress showed a markedincrease in the number of students reaching advanced levelsin math, science and reading, noted Bill Honig, Californiastate superintendent of public instruction.   High school completion rates are at an all-time high. Thegaps in academic performance between whites and blacks areclosing. Some 83% of the 19 and 20 year olds have graduatedfrom high school or its equivalent. Also about 97% of 20through 25 year olds have demonstrated basic literacy, thoughonly 13% can state the main idea in a newspaper article.</TEXT></DOC>
