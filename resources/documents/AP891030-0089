Then came the Chinese army attack in June on studentsdemonstrating for democratic reform, and both sides wondered ifthey hadn't made a terrible mistake.   Americans expressed horror that a country they regarded asfriendly was capable of such harsh repression.   Chinese officials accused Americans of taking advantage ofChina's ``open door'' to sow subversive ideas among intellectualsand students.   The topic of relations has become so ideologically sensitivethat Chinese scholars on U.S. affairs refuse to be interviewed.Many have been investigated for alleged involvement in thedemocracy movement.   Months have gone by but emotions remain high on both sides, withlittle prospect of cooling soon. Leading proponents of realpolitik,including former President Richard Nixon and his former aide,Alexander Haig, have visited Beijing and said it is in both sides'interests to maintain good relations.   At a banquet Monday, Nixon said China and the United States mustovercome ``huge and unbridgeable'' differences and resumecooperation. He also called for a ``humanely governed China.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington: ``Wehave always said that we want to resume good relations with Chinaat some point. The question really is, when and under whatconditions? I would say that at this point we have not reached thattime and we have not seen the right conditions.''   Indeed, each government has made it clear it expects the otherto make the first move in returning to ``normalcy.''   Some say it was the past relationship that was abnormal, withboth sides allowing emotional attraction to outweigh differences inideology and even practical self-interest.   ``There was an element of delusion _ that things were gettingbetter every day in every way,'' said one American working inBeijing. Even if the two governments mend their ties, he said,``things are not going to be the way they were before.''   The clearest symbols of the new relationship are the guards,with battle helmets and automatic rifles, who took up positionsaround the U.S. Embassy and ambassador's residence in June.Plainclothes officials lurk nearby in unmarked cars.   As long as Chinese dissidents Fang Lizhi and his wife, LiShuxian, remain in one of the U.S. compounds, the special guard isunlikely to leave.   Things could get worse. Legislation is pending in the U.S.Congress that would suspend government trade and developmentprograms, bar sales of police equipment, limit high-technologytransfers and allow Chinese students in the United States to stayseveral years beyond their visa expiration dates.   So far, the only sanctions are those announced in June byPresident Bush, who halted high-level contacts and military salesand urged a freeze on international agencies' loans to China.   Bush said he is waiting for the ``proper signals'' from Chineseleaders before lifting the measures, but has not spelled these out.Signals might include an end to martial law in Beijing, imposed May20 during the peak of the student protests, or other moves to easethe crackdown on dissent.   The United States has said it wants non-political exchanges togo on, especially cultural ones. But here China has pulled back,cancelling scholarly exchanges and plans to accept Peace Corpsvolunteers. Chinese education officials have indicated fewerstudents will be sent to the United States.   China also has avoided spelling out conditions fornormalization, but says the United States must take the initiative.Its basic demand is U.S. silence on Chinese domestic affairs.   The quarrel is not the first since China and the United Statesre-established diplomatic relations on Jan. 1, 1979, nor is it insome ways the worst. U.S. arms sales to the rival government onTaiwan in the early 1980s triggered threats from Beijing todowngrade relations.   China canceled sports and cultural exchanges in 1983 after theUnited States granted asylum to a defecting Chinese tennis player,Hu Na.   It may be proof of the relationship's maturity that this timeChina has not threatened to cut or downgrade relations, and thatmany normal exchanges have gone on, including trade.   China also appears to be drawing a line between hard-linestatements for domestic consumption, which condemn the UnitedStates as decadent and imperialist and accuse it of violatinginternational law, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's more moderatestatements to foreign audiences, in which he stresses respectingdifferences and seeking common ground.   On neither side do conditions yet exist for compromise.   The lineup of forces in China's domestic power struggle requiresofficials to prove their ideological purity by denouncing Western``bourgeois'' ideas.   In the United States, the administration seems disposed toresume normal ties gradually. But it is held back by continuedanger from a public that watched the confrontation between troopsand protesters on television.   Chinese scholars noted last year, even during the anniversarycelebrations, that the potential existed for serious rifts.   ``We are friends, not allies,'' said Mei Renyi, an associateprofessor of American studies at the Beijing University of ForiegnStudies. He could not be interviewed now because he is beinginvestigated for supporting the democracy movement.   ``Our systems are different, our ideologies are different,'' hesaid then. ``Our expectations should be realistic.''</TEXT></DOC>
