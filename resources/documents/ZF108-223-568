Elvadia Tolputt reports on developments-Using the Installed BaseStatistics benchmark it was found that this system supported 49 terminals perunit processing power.andP;  With more complex use, a tour operator which uses aVAX 8820, supporting 285 terminals with a mean peak response time of 1.85seconds, dealing with applications such as reservations, billing andaccounting.andP;  This supported 16 terminals per VAX unit processing power.andP;  Theresults of the project are available from the company.andP;  Hankinson will beinterested to see whether the useful to users of Systel.andP;  He expects them tohighlight its performance in a structured and comprehensible way.andP;  One of themanaging director's hopes is that Performance Software's benchmark designwill also be useful to other manufacturers and that it may eventually beapplied IBM and Unix boxes.andP;  Performance Software, which employs 30 people,was the result of a management buyout of the Systel transaction processingsystem for the DEC VAX from Systime.andP;  Finance of #750,000 to date has beenrecieved from Schroder Ventures and Thompson Clive, and further finance hascome from the principles and the UK Department of Trade and Industry.andM;Paris brokersandM;June 30 1989 saw the end of the fiscal year with a pre-tax profit of justunder #250,000 on a turnover of #1.4m.andP;  The company develops system softwarefor the DEC VAX range of computers and it has been appointed a complementarysoftware house by DEC, in spite of being a competitor in the transactionprocessing market.andP;  There are 250 Systel licences in use, the majority at DECsites.andP;  80% of these licences are in the UK with companies such as BritishPetroleum, Midland Bank and The London Hospital.andP;  Other users include RankXerox, Trans World Airlines and various Paris stockbrokers.andP;  Over the pastsix months a new version of Systel has been introduced, which now supportsDEC's RMS and Rdb database management systems.andP;  Hankinson says that Oracleand Ingres may be supported in the future, but there are no plans at present.andO;The company is cautious about supporting Unix, wanting to see how the marketdevelops.andP;  V-Test, a system management product for volume testing, regressiontesting and practical load assessment of VAX systems has also been developed.andO;The company also produces the Video family of terminal monitoring softwareand is the UK distributor of Intelligent Query, an information retrieval andanalysis package.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
