Now Mr. Shapiro thinks interest rates may be headed up again. And this time he's trying to protect himself. Instead of leaving his debt exposed, he's paying $37,000 to a company that advises him how to hedge his $5 million of variable-rate borrowings.    Mr. Shapiro's decision to hedge with Treasury bill futures is an example of how sharp and unpredictable moves in interest rates are spurring business borrowers of all sizes to look again at their means of protection.    Investment bankers report that in recent weeks, more borrowers have turned to rate caps, or guarantees that the rates on their loans won't rise beyond a certain limit. The banks charge fees for the guarantees and hedge the risks themselves through a variety of techniques that include futures, swaps and options. Other borrowers, like Mr. Shapiro, are hiring advice on doing their own hedging.    Stephen O'Sullivan, president and chief executive officer of Peabody, Mass.-based Warren Five Cents Savings Bank, says one of that thrift's strategic goals this year is to evaluate alternatives for hedging its rate exposure. The savings bank also is suggesting that borrowers take a look at hedging programs, Mr. O'Sullivan says although he, like other bankers and financiers, cautions that self-hedging is strewn with pitfalls for the unwary.    &quot;This whole area is becoming much more sophisticated,&quot; says Robert Geske, a University of California at Los Angeles professor who works with Leland O'Brien Rubinstein Associates Inc., a leading developer of hedging techniques. Among the techniques that have become widely adopted are interest-rate swaps, which enable a borrower to trade floating-rate for fixed-rate debt, and caps, which limit interest-rate risk.    A popular variation is called &quot;collars,&quot; an approach that provides both a ceiling and a floor for rates.    Because pricing on interest-rate guarantees is linked to rate volatility, this spring's three quick increases that brought the prime lending rate to 8 1/4% suddenly made them more expensive. But at the same time, borrowers' fears have stimulated the demand for such guarantees. Interest-rate caps are selling particularly well, partly because some borrowers think rates may turn down again and are reluctant to lock in current rates through a swap.    &quot;We have done more business so far this year than in all of last year in the caps area,&quot; says David Young, an executive of the Citicorp division that handles hedging techniques.    An estimated $40 billion of loans was equipped with caps or floors last year, compared with just $5 billion in 1985, according to First Boston Corp. Interest-rate swaps grew to around $175 billion in 1986 from $110 billion in 1985.    Protection, of course, comes at a price. A borrower today would have to pay about $2 million to put a rate cap of 11% on a $100 million, three-year loan set at one percentage point above the prime rate.    Some corporate borrowers used swaps to fix their interest payments in the early 1980s; then they watched as market rates dropped, forcing them to choose between continued high payments and hefty fees for canceling the swaps. Such costs are prompting some companies to explore alternatives that entail more risk but offer lower costs and greater flexibility.    Federal Interest Rate Protection Corp., a six-month-old company based in North Andover, Mass., is offering to help real estate developers hedge interest-rate risk through the Treasury bill or Eurodollar futures markets. The company, which Mr. Shapiro is consulting for advice, uses a computer model to decide when to establish and remove hedge positions.    The program's costs can be far below the price of a cap, and customers are free to withdraw without incurring large cancellation fees. It is designed to cover loans of as little as $250,000, whereas caps and swaps often aren't practical for loans smaller than about $5 million.    But the major drawback is that, unlike caps or swaps, the program doesn't come with any guarantees that it will work. Back-testing of the program by an outside analyst has shown it would have effectively hedged risk in each year since 1979, but future performance isn't assured.    Some regulators and hedging specialists argue that such programs may expose clients to more risk than they realize. Using hedges only when a computer program advises doing so amounts to trying to forecast interest rates, says Douglas Breeden, a Duke University finance professor and co-owner of Smith Breeden Associates Inc., a company that advises thrift institutions on hedging. &quot;That's not hedging; it's speculating,&quot; he says.    Cutter Realty Group Inc., Stamford, Conn., is considering hedging part of a roughly $300 million Hartford, Conn., development through Federal's program. &quot;The jury is still out, as far as we're concerned&quot; on whether the program will be effective, William MacDonald, Cutter's vice president, says. </TEXT></DOC>
