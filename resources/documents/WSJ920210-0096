At the level of presidentialpolitics, the party seems snakebitten.   As the political year approached, the potentialheavyweight Democrats one by one withdrew from the race.President Bush seemed invulnerable; in any event theimportant Congressional Democrats, with the exception ofSenator Al Gore, had blown themselves out of the water byvoting against the enormously successful and popular GulfWar. Once Gov. Mario Cuomo had milked the last ounce of dramafrom his Hamlet act, the party picked from the remainingfield, and was about to coalesce around Gov. Bill Clinton.While his candidacy has survived the Gennifer Flowers jugularthrust, it now seems likely to die a death of a thousandcuts. By this past week end, the talk of the politicalcommunity centered on who might jump in late -- maybe LloydBentsen, Richard Gephardt or Senator Gore.</LP><TEXT>   What is the problem? Why can't the party that dominatesthe Congress field a credible presidential candidate? Itsnominees have been buried in three successive landslides.Since 1968, its only victory was the Carter accident. Thelast sturdy Democrat to be associated with the presidency inany way was Lyndon Johnson. His career ended in tragedy anddisgrace. The Republicans didn't do that, and neither did aprying press. Lyndon Johnson was destroyed by his own party,and therein lies the source of the Democrats' agony to thisday.   A truism of politics for some 20 years has been that aDemocrat had to appease the party's left-leaning specialinterests to win the primary and convention vote. Then themainstream electorate obliterates the candidate in thegeneral election. The dynamic never changed because theDemocratic Congress, which sets the party's agenda, has beena creature of these interests and is insulated from normalcompetition by gerrymandering and other incumbentprotections. Either the party's national figures arethemselves out of the mainstream, witness George McGovern, orthey have to pretend to be to win the nomination, witnessWalter Mondale picking a running mate of Geraldine Ferraro.   The other alternative is the Stealth candidate, a governoror the like with no paper trail on issues like foreign policyor the economy. This worked for Jimmy Carter, but theelectorate does have a learning curve. So a new boy on theblock is likely to get especially intensive scrutiny, witnessMichael Dukakis riding in a tank or flubbing a question thathypothesizes about the rape of his wife.   Governor Clinton is going through the same thing rightnow. Only days after Captain Bill and First Mate Hillarycalled in &quot;60 Minutes&quot; to free the candidacy from destructionby Hurricane Gennifer, new storms have rocked the ArkansasGovernor. The Wall Street Journal last Thursday reportedproblems with Mr. Clinton's draft deferment during theVietnam War. Paul Greenberg of the Pine Bluff CommercialAppeal, today's version of everyone's small-town editor,keeps writing columns introducing his state's governor to thenation as &quot;Slick Willie.&quot;   And now the New York Post dropped potentially the biggestbomb yet under the headline, &quot;Clinton and BCCI.&quot; It seems theClinton Campaign has a $2 million credit line from a bankcontrolled by Little Rock billionaire Jackson Stevens, whowas also involved in the 1970s deals in which the Bank ofCredit and Commerce International acquired its illegalinterest in Washington's First American Bank. While Mr.Clinton is not directly involved, these connections areworrisome given extensive BCCI efforts to buy politicalinfluence around the world.   The worry, however, is bipartisan. While Mr. Stevens is along-time Clinton backer, his wife has also served asArkansas co-chairman of the Bush for President campaign. Andas the Journal reported in December, Mr. Stephens's firmhelped secure a loan from a BCCI-affiliated Swiss bank forHarken Energy, whose board includes President Bush's son,George W. Bush. While investigation of the BCCI scandalprogresses, so far it has tarnished mostly Democrats, ClarkClifford, Bert Lance and former President Carter, adding tothe party's presidential woes.   The more fundamental Democratic problem, though, is asystemic one. So long as the liberal sclerosis typified bythe party's congressional wing holds sway, its presidentialaspirations are forlorn. There have been some early hintsthat the party has grown more interested in shedding thisimage, in looking for a winner. It was by running as amoderate, or at least posturing as one, that Bill Clintonbecame the front-runner. Now it seems the challenge to him inNew Hampshire will come not from a McGovernite Tom Harkin orJapan-basher Bob Kerrey but from Paul Tsongas, who hasemerged from a bout with cancer talking sense.   Still, no Democrat of national stature is equipped tocarry the moderate or mainstream banner. And if the party hasno better choice than to hitch its wagon to an unknown whoselife and career hadn't been vetted, its presidentialcontenders will remain vulnerable to sudden collapse.</TEXT></DOC>
