The lawmakers are using the announcement to again proclaim theirinnocence.   The committee said Friday it has begun preliminary inquiries ofthe six _ the first of three possible investigative steps _ butemphasized in a statement it ``has taken no position as to themerits of the allegations or the weight of the evidence.''   In the savings and loan case, the ethics panel will probe theactivities of Majority Whip Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; BankingCommittee Chairman Donald W. Riegle, Jr., D-Mich.; John McCain,R-Ariz.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.Congressional watchdog Common Cause asked for the investigation.   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. will be the subject of theinfluence-peddling inquiry, expected to focus in part on the awardof federal housing money to the senator's political contributors. Acomplaint was filed by a political opponent of the senator.   ``It's a good move,'' said Murray Flander, press secretary toCranston in a comment that echoed the sentiments expressed by theother five lawmakers.   ``The fact that they are conducting a full preliminaryinvestigation and the fact that he will be cleared, this willobviate any charges of whitewash afterwards,'' he said.   A preliminary inquiry determines whether there is reason tobelieve Senate rules were broken. An affirmative finding is neededbefore the committee would proceed to the next level.   Cranston, Riegle, McCain, DeConcini and Glenn received acombined $1.3 million for their campaigns and causes from CharlesH. Keating Jr., who headed Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine,Calif. The senators met with regulators on Keating's behalf in 1987.   The government didn't seize control of Lincoln until last April14, and the eventual cost to taxpayers is expected to reach arecord level _ for a thrift failure _ of more than $2 billion.   The ethics committee, headed by Sens. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., andWarren Rudman, R-N.H., had hired an outside counsel, Robert Bennettof Washington, to determine whether a formal probe should begin inthe Lincoln case. Another Washington attorney, Henry Schuelke,performed the same role in the D'Amato case. The panel said bothcounsels had recommended the preliminary inquiries.   McCain spokesman Scott Selley said, ``The senator has cooperatedfully with the committee and will continue to do so. Frankly wethink they'll find there was nothing wrong with what Senator McCaindid.''   DeConcini commented, `I welcome a thorough evaluation of thefacts and feel confident that I will be exnerated.''   Glenn was out of town and not available, said assistant presssecretary Paul Brinkman.   D'Amato said he was delighted with the announcement andpredicted, ``My actions are going to be proven to be correct,responsible, and the work appropriate in every matter.''   Riegle's office issued a statement that the senator ``stronglysupports this review and knows it will determine his conduct tohave been entirely proper.''</TEXT></DOC>
