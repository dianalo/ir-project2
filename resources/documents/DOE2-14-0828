Common views among economistsare that OPEC is either not a viable cooperative organization or thatSaudi Arabia is the swing producer holding OPEC together. The conceptof 'reserve sacrifice' and 'capacity sacrifice' ratios are applied andthe variability of production is used to analyse OPEC behaviour. Theanalysis is based on annual data for the 10 most important OPEC countriesfrom 1973-85. The empirical tests indicate that cooperation among theprincipal OPEC nations has been fairly great over the entire period.</TEXT></DOC>
