To listen to the questionsasked by the media and the answers provided by politicalpundits you would think they were discussing a simple-minded,naive and uneducated novice. Anyone who cares to display ashred of unbiased analysis must come to the conclusion thatMr. Quayle is an educated lawyer-politician who has won therespect of most members of Congress who have served with himover the years. He has been credited with serious study,assessment and comprehension of complicated weapons systemsby those whose business it is to know.   Any adult, liberal or conservative, Democrat orRepublican, must concede the point that the media have doneeverything in their power for three years running toembarrass, humiliate and denigrate the man who holds theoffice of vice president. Not only has he carried out theresponsibilities of his office with intelligence and purpose,but he has done so in the face of a smear campaign. And notonce has he lowered himself to the same level of intellectualdishonesty and insipid character assassination as thatdisplayed by the press and the liberal pundits. And Godknows, there are many among the press and pundits whoseintellectual capacity, ethics and purpose are highly suspect.</LP><TEXT>   These reporters and pundits serve no public service, andonce again show how really callous and unworthy they are ofour trust and respect. Why must an educated society put upwith these purveyors of intellectual dishonesty?   James H. McCabe   Marietta, Ga.   ---   I commend you for your outstanding May 7 editorial &quot;TheQuayle `Issue.'&quot; Your realistic and substantive approach tothe difference between the vice president's true characterand capabilities and the liberal media's portrayal of thosequalities was indeed refreshing.
