For the past two years, the 30-year-old Mexican has worked 60 to 70 hours a week mopping floors and flipping pizza dough at Giordano's in trendy Hyde Park, frequently without overtime pay.    But Mr. Cortes found out that he is caught in a double bind. He isn't eligible to apply for a work permit under the portion of the new law that offers amnesty for many illegal immigrants. And he can't complain to authorities about his lack of overtime pay without risking deportation.    His current boss can legally keep him on the payroll indefinitely because he began working there before the law's enactment Nov. 6, 1986, but any new employer would face fines for hiring Mr. Cortes without proper documentation.    As Mr. Cortes -- and other illegal immigrants -- found out, his bosses suddenly had more control of him than ever. Thanks to a little-noticed quirk in the immigration law, Mr. Cortes falls into a strange, new subclass of workers who are ripe for abuse. The number of workers can't be precisely estimated, but it is certainly huge. Census Bureau and Immigration and Naturalization Service data suggest that as many as one million people may fall into this limbo of labor and immigration law.    Mr. Cortes tried complaining to a supervisor, but got nowhere. A year ago, he might have looked for another job, like any unhappy worker. But, he says, &quot;since the law passed, things are not the same here. &quot;He finally decided to leave the country.    Harry Pappas, a relative of Giordano's owner speaking on behalf of the restaurant, says he's thankful that the complaint was brought to his attention and that the restaurant is investigating. He says the owner, who was unavailable for comment, was unaware of any such practice. &quot;We didn't get to where we are at by doing things illegally,&quot; he says. &quot;We are immigrants,&quot; he adds, &quot;and know what they are going through.&quot;    The problem faced by Mr. Cortes was created in the delicate compromises needed to obtain passage of the controversial immigration law. The act was intended to legalize an estimated two million to four million illegal immigrants, while making it unlawful to employ illegals. But there is a catch: Employers are free to keep any illegals on the payroll that were hired before the law was signed on Nov. 6, 1986. At the same time, illegals who aren't farm workers and who entered the country after 1982 are ineligible for amnesty. Barring marriage to a U.S. citizen and a few other routes, the illegal immigrant is destined to remain illegal and can be deported at any time.    Unable to become legal and ineligible for employment anywhere else, their current bosses are the only people in the U.S. who can ever legally employ them. &quot;A large number of people are frozen into their jobs and they, therefore, will not exercise their rights,&quot; Charles Foster, a Houston immigration attorney, testified last month before a committee of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.    Muzaffar Chishti, a lawyer with the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, is even blunter: &quot;I don't think ever since slavery have we seen such an institution for bonded labor.&quot;    Across the country, there are scattered -- though not widespread -- reports that employers are seizing this new advantage by cutting illegals' wages, forcing them to work without overtime and even physically abusing them. In Miami and Chicago, Nicaraguan and Mexican women complain of sexual abuse by bosses. Much of the abuse began before the new immigration law, but some has flourished since. &quot;They have no choice because most places are not hiring illegals,&quot; says a former grocery-store worker in Chicago's La Villita area of her former female co-workers. &quot;They feel like slaves. They swallow their pride and forget their dignity.&quot;    At the shabby apartment of a Chicago &quot;coyote,&quot; or labor merchant, a 62-year-old man known throughout the barrios as &quot;Don Antonio&quot; says he did a booming business recruiting illegals before the law was passed last year. (His $100 finders' fee typically comes out of the worker's paycheck.) The coyote, who tells his story on the condition that only his pseudonym is used, says employers made a point of requesting illegal immigrants &quot;who don't qualify for amnesty.&quot; He says his business has suffered because the turnover among illegal workers isn't as great as it was before the law.    Don Antonio has few apologies for the conditions into which he places illegals. &quot;What am I supposed to do? Investigate the working conditions before? . . . These people damn well know that when they cross that border they will face hardships. They don't need me, you, or anyone else to baby them. I tell them to be prepared for anything,&quot; he says, &quot;even to live like animals.&quot;    To be sure, many employers aren't mistreating illegal immigrant-workers stuck in this workplace limbo. Initially, a Salvadoran pressmen in Houston was concerned to learn that the new law had outlawed employment of illegals -- but was later relieved to find that he was grandfathered as a legal employee, having been hired before the law took effect. &quot;My boss said there was no problem,&quot; the pressman says, and his wages and working conditions haven't changed.    But the pressman is discomforted knowing the hurdles of finding a new job if his employer suddenly gets tough, or if he is laid off. After a counseling session at a refugee center in Houston, he turned to his young wife, an apartment-complex maid, and simply said, &quot;Vamos a Honduras.&quot;    In many cases involving wage cutbacks, the law is on the employer's side. Without a union contract, employers can cut wages to the federal minimum at will. And although many labor-law protections have applied to illegals, according to one recent court decision that could begin changing. To award illegals the same protections of the federal minimum wage and overtime provisions &quot;would effectively repudiate the policy and purpose&quot; of the new immigration law, a federal judge in Birmingham, Ala., ruled in May. The ruling is being appealed.    While some workers have tried to fight on-the-job abuses, their uncertain legal status is a heavy burden. Even immigrantrights attorneys, who once could be counted on to leap to the workers' defense, are throwing up their hands in frustration. In San Antonio, Texas, an attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund says an illegal immigrant came for help after his foreman beat him for refusing to take a pay cut. The attorney referred him to the local district attorney to file criminal assault charges but doubts that the worker pursued the case. &quot;He was so frightened that he didn't even want me to approach the employer,&quot; says attorney Beto Juarez.    Indeed, although illegals have always been a pliant work force, the new law has made them all the less assertive. That was plain during the recent 17th annual summer festival in the Adams-Morgan area of Washington, D.C., where the parade was dedicated to the many illegals who today make the neighborhood their home.    &quot;This is not our land,&quot; says a 31-year-old Salvadoran, tapping his feet as the band strikes up a chorus of &quot;La Migra,&quot; played to the tune of the current Top 40 hit &quot;La Bamba.&quot; Floats, some sponsored by local construction companies that employ the illegals, roll by, one bearing the parade's &quot;Senorita El Salvador.&quot;    To keep their jobs, the Salvadoran and his friends suggest actually volunteering to take pay cuts as a sort of &quot;bond&quot; should their employers get fined for employing them. Other illegal workers tell war stories of employers demanding that they pay such bonds to keep their jobs. &quot;My employer told me he may need to take some money off my check in September because of the fines,&quot; says one worker in the crowd. &quot;What can I do? Quit? I'm not crazy.&quot;    The Salvadorans don't realize that as workers &quot;grandfathered&quot; under the law, it is perfectly legal for their employers to keep them on the payroll. &quot;Extortion&quot; is how an INS spokesman describes employers' demands for such bonds. The new law provides a $1,000 penalty for bosses trying to extract such bonds but doesn't address employees who offer to pay them.    The young Salvadoran urges compliance by his friends. &quot;We are illegals,&quot; he says, and where pays cuts are concerned, &quot;we should not protest or complain . . . We should be grateful that there are employers who hire us. . . .&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
