The degenerate states pertaining to a single Landau levelare coupled by a random potential. We develop a matrix algorithm thatmaps this problem onto a path-integral problem in two dimensions. Fora class of random potentials, we calculate the average level densityfor an arbitrary Landau level, and we show that the problem differs fromthe localization problem without magnetic field only by the presenceof the topological term. The coefficient multiplying this term is givenexplicitly.</TEXT></DOC>
