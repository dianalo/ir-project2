This paper explores several issues related to the conceptof a universal authoring system and concludes with an alternative prescriptionboth for users (customers) and vendors. The user prescription includesa clear definition of requirements and establishment of internal standards.The vendor prescription includes working with the users more closelyto aid in system comparison. This task is very difficult now becauseof nonstandard criteria used by the scores of vendors involved. A modelfor a {open_quotes}universal{close_quotes} authoring system is presentedto illustrate that the options are endless. Technical issues regardingdifficulties of achieving universality of authoring without restrictingprogress in hardware. The authors agree that the plethora of authoringsystems on the market today inhibits courseware portability, but we feelthat our free enterprise system as well as more informed consumers willhelp reduce the number of surviving authoring systems. 11 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
