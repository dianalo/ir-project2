The GSA said it is investigating whether F.L. Soni, the head of network design for a $55 million phone-switch contract, improperly accepted meals from competitors of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and divulged ATandamp;T's confidential information to them over dinner.    John Dowd, a lawyer for Mr. Soni, wrote to the GSA to say that Mr. Soni will refuse to answer questions about his role in the switch procurement, citing the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.    But Mr. Soni, reached at home, denied that he had either accepted meals from ATandamp;T competitors or had divulged any information to them. &quot;I'm not at fault,&quot; Mr. Soni said.    If GSA contracting officers are found to have skewed the awards for the $55 million contract, it could raise questions about the impartiality in the bidding process on the FTS-2000 job. The seven Bell companies are bidding in a team against ATandamp;T for the 10-year contract.    A GSA spokesman said the investigation into Mr. Soni shouldn't influence the award of the FTS-2000 contract to replace the federal government's phone system, which could be valued at as much as $25 billion. The GSA spokesman said Mr. Soni, who has been reassigned to a job outside of procurement, didn't do any work on the FTS-2000 contract. Therefore, the spokesman said, he couldn't have influenced the award of the larger contract.    Mr. Dowd, Mr. Soni's lawyer, said he advised his client to refuse to answer questions because he couldn't ascertain the direction of the investigations into the phone-switching contract. He accused the GSA of &quot;McCarthy&quot; tactics, by implying that Mr. Soni was guilty of wrongdoing because he would assert his Fifth Amendment rights. &quot;He's being hung out to dry,&quot; Mr. Dowd said.    The GSA's inspector general, the Justice Department and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee are investigating whether the GSA improperly favored competitors of ATandamp;T in awarding contracts for 12 telephone switches. Investigators said they are looking at allegations that GSA employees in charge of telecommunications purchasing may have improperly provided confidential ATandamp;T information to some of the regional Bell telephone companies, which won awards for seven of the switches.    A GSA spokesman said he hadn't any reason to suspect that any GSA employee, other than Mr. Soni, was under investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
