The ABC News poll, based on interviews with 8,659 voters lastThursday through Sunday in all 16 states holding primaries today,also found Rep. Richard Gephardt ahead only in his home state ofMissouri.   In its survey released Monday night, ABC said Dukakis's lead inTexas was ``paper-thin'' over Jackson and Gephardt, who were tiedfor second in the state. But Dukakis had a strong lead in Florida,as well as back home in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.   On the Republican side, ABC said the poll indicates today'sevents look ``like a blow-out for George Bush in virtually allstates except Missouri.''   Overall, in the dozen Southern states with primaries, Bush ledBob Dole, 60 percent to 20 percent, followed by Pat Robertson at 12percent and Jack Kemp at 4 percent. Four percent were undecided.   Among the Democrats in the South, Jackson led with 29 percent toDukakis's 25 percent, with Gore in third at 21 percent and Gephardtfourth with 13 percent. Gary Hart was fifth at 5 percent, followedby Paul Simon at 2 percent. Four percent were undecided and 1percent supported other candidates.   ABC said the Southern state results had a margin of error ofthree percentage points in either direction, but the samples forthe non-Southern states were too small to generate specific figuresfor the candidates.   It also said the horse-race figures for the entire South weresomewhat misleading because the two largest states, Texas andFlorida, make up a large share of the vote. It said Jackson led inmost of the deep South, with Gore, the Tennessee senator, runningsecond.   It said Jackson's strongest leads were in Alabama andMississippi, where nearly half the voters polled said they supporthim. He also led among voters polled in Arkansas, Georgia,Louisiana, North Carolina and Virginia. Jackson was second inTennessee behind Gore and second in Florida and Maryland behindDukakis, and tied for second with Gephardt in Texas.   Dukakis led among the voters ABC polled in Florida, Maryland,Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Texas. ABC said Dukakis seemed tobe headed for second in Virginia behind Jackson, while he was intight battles for second with Gore in Arkansas, Louisiana and NorthCarolina.   Gore had strong leads in Tennessee and Kentucky and a thin edgein Oklahoma, where ABC said Gephardt was ``running only slightlybehind him.''   Gephardt was ahead in the poll only in Missouri and second justbehind Gore in Oklahoma and second to Gore in Kentucky. Gephardtand Jackson were tied behind Dukakis in Texas. ABC said Gephardtwas running fourth in most of the other states and was in danger offalling below the 15 percent threshold for delegates in a dozen ofthe 16 primary states.   In an earlier ABC News poll completed Feb. 28, Jackson ledDukakis across the South by just 26 to 25 percent, followed by Gorewith percent, Gephardt 13 percent and Hart 7 percent. Simon had 3percent, 6 percent were undecided and 1 percent were for others.   ABC said Dukakis has lost a bit of support in the deep South toGore, but Gore has not been able to pull off the Southern sweep hisstrategy called for.   It said Bush's 60-20 lead over Dole region-wide is paced by thevice president's strong showings in Texas and Florida. Bush was thechoice of about 40 percent of those polled in Missouri, and 70percent in Texas. ``In most states he is getting more than 50percent of the vote against his three rivals,'' ABC said.   Dole averages in the low 20s across the South, while Robertsonaverages 12 percent. Kemp averaged only 4 percent in the Southernstates. Kemp's best states in the poll were Massachusetts and RhodeIsland, where he was the choice of about 10 percent of those polled.</TEXT></DOC>
