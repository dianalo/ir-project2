The reports came as Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir opened aconference of world Jewish leaders with a call for solidarity andwon a standing ovation for equating the PLO to the biblicalmurderers of the Jews.   The daily newspapers Haaretz and Yediot Ahronot said ``authorizedelements of appraisal'' _ believed to be military and intelligenceofficials _ concluded the Palestine Liberation Organization has madesubstantive changes and wants a ``realistic political settlement.''   That assessment was given to Shamir's Cabinet, along with thejudgment that no dialogue with the Palestinians was possible withoutthe PLO, the newspapers said.   According to the reports, the intelligence sources said thePalestinian uprising could continue for years and be kept atmanageable levels by the military, but it would not end without apolitical solution.   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Shamir, said the reports wereinaccurate and misleading but would not comment further.   A succession of Israeli governments have refused to deal with thePLO, which Israel views as a terrorist group. However, some doves inthe center-left Labor Party have recently advocated talking to thePLO as the only way to resolve the Palestinian problem.   Shamir made it clear at the conference he had not softened in hisapproach to the PLO.   ``We have the power and determination to confront the Hamans ofthis generation and to expose their deception, their double-talk,and to rid the world of their venom and ideology once and for all,''Shamir said.   Haman plotted to exterminate the Jews at the time of the Persianking Xerxes, the Book of Esther says.   ``At times like this, when our people's desperate yearning forpeace is questioned by some, we want our sisters and brothers tocome forward and explode this blasphemy,'' Shamir declared. ``We mayhave our differences on how to achieve our dream of peace, but weare united ... that peace is our goal.''   In prepared remarks handed out earlier to reporters, Shamir saidagreeing to a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip would not solve the problem.   ``Our government is united in its opposition to the creation of aPalestinian Arab state west of the River Jordan,'' he said. ``We areopposed to negotiations with the PLO because it will inevitably leadto a demand for a state.''   Israel radio said some delegates rose at an earlier closedmeeting to recommend negotiations with the PLO.   President Chaim Herzog opened the conference of 1,100 Jewishleaders from 30 countries.   ``We dare not underestimate the feelings expressed in the unrest,nor should we ... expect it to simply fade away,'' he said of thePalestinian uprising that began more than 15 months ago, in which403 Palestinians and Israelis have been killed.   ``There is no way but peace, no solution but through open, free,bilateral negotiations.   ``This requires emergence of a fearless, sober Palestinianleadership ... which will abandon negation of Israel's right toexist, will abandon the path of violence and terror and will enterinto negotiations without preconditions.''   A call for talks with the PLO by Deputy Finance Minister YossiBeilin, an aide to Labor leader Shimon Peres brought criticism frommembers of Shamir's conservative Likud bloc and predictions of anend to the Labor-Likud coalition.   Peres also suggested the coalition partners might divide over thepeace issue.   ``I think in the coming months we shall have to make up ourmind,'' he said on Israel radio. ``If we can find a joint solution,fine. If not, we will have to make an historic choice.''   In Baghdad, Iraq, PLO chairman Yasser Arafat told a newsconference Israel government is using a plan to halt the uprisingthat consists of ``escalating oppressive measures and intensifyingthe iron-fist polices against our people, while ... offering somenew ideas on a settlement to the conflict ... aimed at distractingworld opinion.''   He denied reports the United States asked the PLO to haltmilitary operations against Israel as a condition of continuing adialogue that began in December. Washington lifted a 13-year ban ondealing with the PLO after Arafat publicly renounced terrorism andrecognized Israel's right to exist.   Arafat said the PLO has the right to conduct ``all kinds ofstruggle'' against Israel, but indicated recent attacks were mountedby rival Palestinian factions to embarrass him.   Israeli forces repelled four guerrilla incursions last week,including two from Lebanon and one each from Jordan and Egypt. Fiveguerrillas and one Israeli soldier were killed.   Arafat said PLO officials meeting in Tunis on March 29 with U.S.Ambassador Robert Pelletreau will ask for active Americaninvolvement in efforts to convene an international peace conferenceon the Middle East peace conference.</TEXT></DOC>
