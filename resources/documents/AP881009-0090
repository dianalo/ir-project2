In a statement distributed late Saturday by the official SaudiPress Agency, Nazer stressed that the kingdom would push foradherence to the quotas assigned by the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries.   ``The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has not thought of pulling out ofOPEC,'' he said. ``The media have been giving unjustifiedexplanations of the cabinet statement which was worded carefully soas to avoid any interpretations.''   Last Monday, following a regular cabinet meeting chaired by KingFahd, Saudi Arabia said it would not accept that some members ofOPEC cheat on their production quotas at its expense.   It said the kingdom was prepared to abide by its quota of 4.343million barrels a day provided the others adhered to their quotas.It also stressed it was not prepared to re-assume the role of``swing producer,'' committing the kingdom to curtail its outputwhen others exceed theirs.   Saudi Arabia, Nazer said, ``is not satisfied with the currentmarket situation nor does it consider it of its making, and itstill calls for a return to the defined production levels and willbe the first to abide by them.''   Nazer said OPEC states which were disturbed by the current oilmarket situation ``should return to quota levels and help restorestability to the oil market.''   Overproduction by some of the cartel's member states hasgenerated a glut on the world oil market, forcing prices to dropabout $5 below OPEC's benchmark of $18 a barrel.   The kingdom, the world's largest oil exporter and the leadingmember of the cartel, produced more than 10 million barrels a dayat the peak of the oil boom in 1982.   Oil industry reports have estimated that Saudi Arabia hasexceeded its quota, producing about 6 million barrels a day. Thereports speculated the kingdom was deliberately boosting itsproduction to enforce discipline within OPEC.</TEXT></DOC>
