IBM had been widely expected to introduce the new models next month. But sources said the company decided to delay the new line until early next year to have more software available.    The apparent delay is a short-term setback to IBM's effort to pick up momentum in the fastest-growing segment of the computer industry, where it is struggling against competition from Sun Microsystems Inc., Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. The market for workstations -- powerful computers used by engineers, scientists and financial analysts -- is growing about 40% a year and is expected to reach $6.8 billion this year, according to Framingham, Mass.-based market researcher International Data Corp.    An IBM spokesman read a statement saying that the company &quot;is considering a number of announcement alternatives, including later this year and the first quarter of next year. Any speculation on specific announcement dates at this time would be misleading.&quot;    Sources said that IBM had planned to make the announcement Oct. 17 and had gone so far as to rent hotel suites for that date. Its competitors had long planned for IBM's announcment at that time.    IBM's competitors are expected to benefit from a delay of even a few months. &quot;Digital is going to have more than 200 software packages running on its workstations by the time IBM is shipping,&quot; said Marc G. Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities Inc. Abundant software packages are critical to the success of a computer line.    Depending on who's counting, either Sun or Hewlett-Packard hold the lead in this competitive business. The focus of most of the attention today is in the market for machines based on the Unix software operating system. Mr. Schulman called Digital's DECstation line &quot;the absolute leader in price performance&quot; in that market.    But Mr. Schulman and other analysts expect that IBM will price its new line aggressively in a bid to make up for lost time in the Unix-based workstation market. IBM's current workstation product, the RT, has captured only a tiny share, says International Data's David Card.    William J. Filip, IBM's assistant general manager of personal systems, said last night that &quot;we have not and had not selected a final date for an announcement. At some point, we will pull the plug and proceed to an announcement. But we haven't made that call yet.&quot;    He said that IBM is continuing work on software and endorsements of the new line. But he declined comment on pricing. &quot;We intend to be competitive in this fast-moving marketplace,&quot; he said.    ---   Paul B. Carroll contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
