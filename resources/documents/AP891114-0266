The loss compared with a net profit of $355 million, or $1.55 ashare, in the third quarter of last year.   The consumer products giant was taken private in October 1988 ina $24.53 billion leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.Therefore, there are no per-share figures for the latest results.   Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 was $3 billion, downfrom $3.2 billion a year earlier.   The company said strong performances by its food and foreigntobacco businesses were more than offset by the decline in itsdomestic cigarette income, caused by a program to eliminate excessinventories.   Inventories became inflated because of a practice known as tradeloading, in which the company essentially induced wholesalecustomers to buy more product _ in this case cigarettes _ then theycould quickly resell.   RJR Nabisco decided earlier this year to end the practice, alsoused by other domestic cigarette makers and in other industries.The practice effectively overstated operating profits in RJRNabisco's tobacco division by some $250 million in recent years,the company said.   Unit sales of cigarettes have been declining in the UnitedStates, helping to bloat inventories that then had to be scaledback when the company decided to end the practice.   ``RJR Nabisco made substantial progress in the third quarter,''Chairman Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., said in a statement. ``Excludingour decision to reduce U.S. tobacco trade inventories, our food andtobacco businesses showed excellent earnings growth.''   Gerstner said the company is ahead of schedule in its program todivest assets.   RJR Nabisco recently announced an agreement to sell its BabyRuth, Butterfinger and Pearson candy businesses to Nestle FoodsCorp. for around $370 million. It also agreed to sell its Nabiscofood businesses in Spain and Portugal to a Spanish company for$77.5 million.   The latest sales brought the company close to its goal ofdivesting $5.5 billion in assets to raise cash and reduce debtamassed in the leveraged buyout.   RJR Nabisco's products include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers andWinston cigarettes. Its major subsidiaries are R.J. ReynoldsTobacco Co., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International Inc., NabiscoBrands Inc. and Planters LifeSavers Co.   In the first nine months of the year, the company posted a netloss of $1.01 billion, compared with a net profit of $980 million,or $4.14 a share, in the same period in 1988.   Nine-month revenue rose to $9.2 billion from $9.1 billion a yearearlier.   In line with the divestiture program, the Nabisco Internationaland Del Monte Foods businesses have been treated as discontinuedoperations in both the third-quarter and nine-month results.</TEXT></DOC>
