It's the deadline under a 1986 law for 30,000 industrialinstallations to file with federal and state authorities anestimated 1.5 million pages reporting all their releases of 328hazardous chemicals to the environment in 1987.   The Environmental Protection Agency is supposed to put theinformation into a data base that anyone with a personal computerand a telephone modem can query. That system won't be up andrunning until sometime next year.   Environmental groups are hoping it will build pressure fortighter restrictions on future emissions of dangerous chemicals.There is less concern about releases to waterways or the ground,already closely monitored under other laws.   Backers saw the ``community right to know'' provisions as aresponse to the Bhopal, India, disaster in 1984 in which about3,000 people were killed by an escaping cloud of methyl isocyanate,a pesticide raw material.   But industry, government and environmental groups are allworried that many small businesses don't realize they are coveredby the law, which provides fines of up to $25,000 a day for failureto comply.   ``I think there's a lot of misunderstanding out there,''especially among companies that think they are exempt because theyare not chemical manufacturers, said Mary Bernhard, manager ofenvironmental policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   ``I got a tremendous number of calls from food processingcompanies,'' said Theresa Pugh of the National Association ofManufacturers. ``They didn't realize they were covered, but they doa lot of cleaing of vats with really strong solvents to keep downbacteria.''   Paint-using industries also seem unaware, she said.   The reporting requirements apply to companies in the CommerceDepartment's standard industrial classiciations 20 through 39,manufacturers of all kinds that have 10 or more employees and meetquantity thresholds: initially 75,000 pounds a year manufactured or``processed'' of any of the 328 chemicals _ perhaps as a rawmaterial _ or 10,000 pounds a year ``used'' _ perhaps as a cleaningmaterial.   ``What impressed me was the large size of the numbers,'' said EdHopkins of the Ohio Public Interest Campaign, who inspected thefirst 70 forms arriving at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agencyin Columbus two weeks ago.   ``One hundred thousand pounds of hydrochloric acid from onesmall facility in northeastern Ohio _ I think that's a lot.''   Even larger numbers are going to be heard. An estimated 2.2billion pounds a year of toluene, a common petrochemical, arereleased to the air nationwide each year.   ``I don't know what the public reaction is going to be. I wouldhope people are going to be so shocked they will call for furthercontrols,'' said Bill Klinefelter, a lobbyist with the NationalWildlife Federation.   The chemical industry has been visiting newspaper offices formonths to place its side of the story before editors.   Many companies have been releasing the forms to local mediaoutlets, and environmentalists say they are eager to ``put theirown spin on the numbers,'' according to Debbie Sheiman of the CleanAir Coalition, a group of environmental and other organizations.   Chris Cathcart of the Chemical Manufacturers Association said hewould give this advice to to any citizen coming across news ofreleases in the community: ``If the way the information is reportedgives him concern, he should ask questions of someone he hasconfidence in.''   ``It's too early'' to conclude that new laws are needed, he said.   EPA's Sam Sassnet, part of the team dealing with the incomingreports, said 10,000 pieces of mail had been received.   For people interested in looking up a plant from theirneighborhood, ``Their first recourse is to go to the state,'' hesaid.   In September, EPA hopes to be able to mail copies of anyparticular form to people requesting it; later this month it hopesto open a reading room which will gradually fill with reports asdocuments are logged in.</TEXT></DOC>
