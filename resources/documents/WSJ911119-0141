The justices will decide whether a regulation that has theeffect of eliminating the entire value of certain privatereal estate obligates the state to pay property owners fortheir loss. The case could have a broad impact on bothcompanies and individuals whose land is subject toenvironmental, health or safety regulations.</LP><TEXT>   Generally, the Constitution's Fifth Amendment prohibitsgovernment from taking property without paying &quot;justcompensation&quot; to the owner. The question in this case iswhether South Carolina's regulation of construction on itsenvironmentally fragile coastline amounted to a taking ofproperty rights from an individual who intended to build onbeach front real estate.   The high court hasn't established firm rules to determinewhen such a regulation amounts to a taking; as a result,lower courts have issued conflicting opinions, and the mattercontinues to generate a considerable amount of litigation.   In this case, the plaintiff, David Lucas, paid $975,000 in1986 for two beach front lots on which he planned to buildtwo houses, one for himself and one to sell. A state agencybarred the construction under the environmental law, whichtook effect in 1988. Mr. Lucas sued, arguing that theregulation denied him &quot;all economically viable use&quot; of hisland.   A state court agreed and awarded him $1.2 million for the&quot;regulatory taking&quot; of his property. The South CarolinaSupreme Court reversed that decision, ruling that arestriction &quot;enacted to prevent serious public harm&quot; doesn'trequire a state to compensate land owners for their losses.The state high court invoked a 1987 Supreme Court case thatupheld Pennsylvania mining restrictions against a FifthAmendment challenge by coal companies.   The 1987 case, decided 5-4, stressed that resolution ofsuch disputes ought to turn on &quot;the particular facts&quot; of eachcase. Two members of the five-justice majority in thatopinion, William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, have sinceretired.   Mr. Lucas called the 1987 decision &quot;cryptic&quot; and urged theU.S. Supreme Court to clarify the law in this area. (Lucasvs. South Carolina Coastal Council)</TEXT></DOC>
