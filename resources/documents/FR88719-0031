The Conference Reportaccompanying the 1984 Act (H.R. Rep. No. 600, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 38 (1984))indicates that cooperative activities of shippers seeking shipping serviceswould not be proscribed by the antitrust laws if the cooperating grouplacks threatening market power. In a Notice dated May 15, 1984 on the Statusof Shippers' Associations under the 1984 Act, the Commission announcedits intention to address on an <T3>ad hoc</T3> basis matters and issues arising from shippers' associationactivities subject to the 1984 Act, rather than to issue industry-widerules. Subsequently, when petitioned to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to setforth procedures by which carriers could determine if an entity meets thestatutory definition of ``shippers' association,'' the Commission reiteratedits policy against implementing an industry-wide regime of regulation ofthe formation and operation of shippers' associations. Order Denying Petition,22 SRR 1624 (1985). It specifically rejected the suggestion that shippers'associations be required to produce for the benefit of carriers and conferenceswith which they are negotiating, any Department of Justice Business ReviewLetters they had received. The Commission suggested that the only protectiona carrier or conference may need is a certification, obtained perhaps duringthe course of normal business negotiations, that the group meets the statutorydefinition of ``shippers' association.'' The Commission also indicatedthat there is little potential for conference exposure to the antitrustlaws, should a shippers' association with which a conference is dealingturn out not to be a true shippers' association, as long as the conferenceis acting in good faith. The Commission noted: <ITAG tagnum="21">Section 7(a)(2) of the [1984] Act [46 U.S.C. andSection; 1706(a)(2)]* * * exempts from the antitrust laws any activity or agreement undertakenor entered into with a reasonable basis to conclude that it is pursuantto an effective agreement. Therefore, if a conference agreement containslanguage authorizing negotiations with shippers or shippers' associations,the conference would appear to have antitrust protection. </ITAG>The Commission further explained that given section 10(b)(13)'s requirementthat carriers <T3>must </T3>negotiate with shippers' associations, a carrier could claimthe defense of implied immunity from the antitrust laws should its conductbe challenged. In spite of these Commission pronouncements, as well as similar advicecontained in speeches and Business Review Letters from the Department ofJustice, shippers' associations continue to request Business Review Lettersfrom the Department of Justice, allegedly because conferences refuse tonegotiate with them unless they have such a letter. Thus, it appears thatconferences may be adhering to the mistaken belief that they may inadvertentlyviolate the antitrust laws by negotiating a service contract with an associationitself violating the antitrust laws. Regardless of a conference's motive,a refusal to negotiate with a shippers' association pending receipt ofdocumentation which has been established to be clearly unnecessary or immaterialconstitutes a section 10(b)(13) prohibited act. Because of the continuing nature of this problem, the Department of Justice,in order to alleviate the expenditure of its resources inherent in thepreparation of reptitive Business Review Letters, has requested that theCommission take action to clarify its views on the subject. Therefore,in order to dispel any misunderstandings which apparently persist regardingshippers' associations' and carriers' risks of antitrust exposure whilenegotiating a service contract, the Commission proposes to issue an interpretiverule clarifying that carriers and conferences may not require shippers'associations to produce Business Review Letters prior to or as part ofthe negotiation process. An interpretive rule should help to eliminateunnecessary impediments to the operation of shippers' associations andthe negotiation of service contracts. Comments from interested partieslimited to this narrow issue will be considered prior to issuance of afinal interpretive rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subject in 46 CFR Part 571</ITAG>Antitrust Contracts, Maritime carriers, Shippers' associations.Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553; and secs. 7, 8, 10, and 17 of theShipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. app. 1706, 1707, 1709 and 1716) the FederalMaritime Commission proposes to add a new Part 571 to Subchapter D of Title46 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 571_INTERPRETATIONS AND STATEMENTS OF POLICY</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 553, 46 U.S.C. app. 1706, 1707, 1709, and1716.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 571.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Interpretation of Shipping Act of 1984_Refusal to negotiate with shippers'associations.</ITAG>(a) Section 8(c) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act'') authorizesocean common carriers and conferences to enter into a service contractwith shippers' associations, subject to the requirements of the 1984 Act.Section 10(b)(13) of the 1984 Act prohibits carriers from refusing to negotiatewith a shippers' association.
