It is shown that when solutions ofsulfuric acid phosphoric acids, potassium phosphotungstate, and sodiumand potassium carbonates are used in place of perchloric and nitric acidsthe E/sub p/{sup 0} value moves in the negative direction for both berkeliumand cerium, which indicates strong complexation of ions of these elements.The thermodynamic parameters {Delta}G, {Delta}H, and {Delta}S of thereaction Me{sup 3+} + H{sup +} reversible Me{sup 4+} + 1/2 H{sub 2} (Me= Bk, Ce) are determined.</TEXT></DOC>
