After the merger, the broadcast and entertainment concern will become a subsidiary of FMI Financial Corp., a Cincinnati-based holding company controlled by Mr. Lindner.    The combination will conclude a long contest for control of Taft involving Mr. Lindner, a group led by Texas investor Robert M. Bass and a group led by Dudley S. Taft, a member of the company's founding family.    All three parties, who together controlled 46% of Taft, eventually came together in the partnership headed by Mr. Lindner and agreed to split up various Taft properties. Mr. Lindner himself controls 16.2% of Taft.    The merger, which must still be cleared by the Federal Communications Commission, would transfer most of the operating assets of Taft to FMI, giving it substantial broadcasting interests for the first time. Reflecting that difference, FMI plans to change its name. A spokeswoman said the new name will be Great American Communications.    The merger would cost FMI $1.28 billion, after accounting for payments to holders within the Lindner-led partnership as well as other holders, the satisfaction of certain debt and other merger-related expenses. FMI plans to finance the merger mostly through $650 million in bank debt and $543 million in debt securities.    As previously reported, Taft holders not in the Lindner-led partnership would receive for each of their shares either $157 or, if they chose, $144 plus one common share of FMI.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Taft closed at $155.875, down 50 cents. In national over-the-counter trading, FMI closed at $15.875, down 25 cents.    Holders would also receive an additional 50 cents a share for each month between Oct. 1 and the closing, but not beyond March 31, 1988.    FMI, which is 71%-controlled by Mr. Lindner's American Financial Corp., also based in Cincinnati, is considering whether to sell its interests in casualty insurance and food processing, possibly to an American Financial affiliate. Part of the proceeds of any sale would be used to reduce the bank debt.    Mr. Taft plans to leave his positions as vice chairman and a director of Taft. Otherwise, said Charles S. Mechem Jr., Taft's chairman and chief executive, management wouldn't change.    Under the merger agreement, the Bass group, which has a 24.9% stake in Taft, will receive $157.5 million plus Taft properties that the Lindner-led partnership values at about $200 million. Those properties are the WTVN-TV station in Columbus, Ohio, and interests in two cable-television operations. The Bass group acquired its stake in Taft for $205 million.    Under an agreement between FMI and Mr. Taft, FMI plans to sell Taft's WGHPTV station in High Point, N.C., for no less than $45 million to a concern to be formed by Mr. Taft. The same agreement further provides that FMI will make $235 million in loans available to the Taft concern, so that it can acquire communications properties including WGHP-TV.    The right to use the Taft Broadcasting Co. name will pass to Mr. Taft. A Taft family group will also receive cash or preferred stock in FMI for its 6.3% stake in Taft. </TEXT></DOC>
