Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trendsand an active opponent of some biological research projects, saidhe is organizing the citizens' group as a result of plans for thegovernment to finance research that would map the human geneticcode.   The genetic code forms the blueprint for all human physicalcharacteristics. It determines why some people have blue eyes andblond hair, and others have brown hair and brown eyes. It alsogives a predisposition for some illnesses and disabilities.   Rifkin said that once the genetic code, or genome, is knownthere is a possibility that this will be used by employers,insurance companies and others to discriminate against people whosegenetic make up includes potential disease-causing defects.   ``A new kind of discrimination will arise, not based on skincolor, but on genetic makeup,'' Rifkin said at a news conference.``We don't want to see the emergence of a commercial geneticdiscrimination in this country.''   Rifkin said his group is proposing that organizing and financinga citizens' commission on genetic ethics be a part of anylegislation that would finance research on the human genome.   Earlier this year the National Academy of Sciences proposed thatthe government finance a $3 billion effort to map the function ofthe 100,000 genes that make up the human genetic code. The projectis now being considered by Congress.   Rifkin said funds should not be provided for the scientificresearch unless money also is appropriated to control theapplication of knowledge developed by the technical research.   Without such controls, he said, ``we face the very realpossibility of a new form of eugenics in this country.'' Eugenicsis the concept of improving the human species by controllinghereditary factors through controlled mating or through genetics.   Rifkin said some legislators have agreed to introducelegislation requiring the genetics advisory board, but he declinedto name sponsors of the legislation.   He said the commission is supported by what he said were ``70prominent national leaders'' of civil rights, labor, disabilityrights and religious groups. Seven representatives from thosegroups attended the news conference.   Deborah Kaplan, a California attorney and a disability rightsactivists, said the genetics research could be used by employers toexclude some people from jobs. She said many disabled workers noware denied jobs for medical reasons and the genetic technology``could provide more sophisticated means of screening people out ofjobs that they could do.''   This would be done, she said, by labeling people based on theirgenetic potential for illness or disability.   ``There are too many labels now,'' she said, ``and this willgive us still more labels we can apply to people.''   Rabbi David Saperstein, representing a Washington center ofreform Judaism, said new knowledge such as the genetic code must becarefully applied because there no longer is room for technologicalerror.   ``This is the first generation of humanity that does not havethe benefit of making mistakes in applying technology,'' he said.``All of human history is a test run for this moment.''   He said that because of the eugenics experiments conducted onJews by the Nazis in World War II his religious community isparticularly sensitive to the application of new genetic knowledge.   Rifkin said the proposed commission, to be called the HumanGenome Policy Board, would comprise 12 members, six each selectedby the House and the Senate. He said the board would appoint acommittee of 18 that broadly would represent all special interestgroups concerned with issues of genetics.   He said the proposal would include an appropriation of $3.5million to finance the work of the board and the committee.</TEXT></DOC>
