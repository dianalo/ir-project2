(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Most users probably bought their first database some years ago and are eitherentirely happy with it or would only be willing to move to a new product thatoffers attractive extra features, a high level of ease-of-use and betterperformance.andM;Alpha Four and Delta Five - two database packages with radically differentbackgrounds - approach the market in different ways.andP;  Alpha Four offersdirect compatibility with dBase III, an easy-to-use menu command system and aflexible application budder.andP;  it's aimed at the personal business user ratherthan a multi-user or networking corporate setup.andP;  Alpha Four arrived in theUK from the US earlier this year.andP;  it claims to have sold more than 20,000copies in the US and has proved to be an attractive package for those userswho want to do some programming without getting their hands too dirty.andM;By contrast, Delta Five offers what might be called a  professional' productaimed more at application budders rather than end-users.andP;  it providesfeatures for multi-user network access (database locking and networkadministration utilities).andP;  Delta Five also offers extensive customisationfeatures, screen designers, process utilities (sort, data extract and so on)and a range of import/export filters.andP;  Delta Five was developed in the UK byCompsoft and has a long and respectable pedigree in its home market.andM;Despite the apparent differences between the products and the market theyseek to address, there are some interesting similarities between Delta Fiveand Alpha Four which highlight the state of the art in database packagetechnology.andM;In most sectors, software suppliers have recognised that the only way todifferentiate your product is to offer features that no one else does.andO;Unfortunately for the suppliers, the market is moving so fast that featureswhich were once  luxuries' quickly become mandatory.andP;  This has caused manysoftware developers to look beyond the immediate scope of their chosenapplication' area for related features in other areas.andM;Word processors look increasingly like desktop publishing packages.andO;Spreadsheets look more and more like databases.andP;  And databases? Well, fromthe new features evident in these two products, databases look like followinga similar course.andM;Both Delta Five and Alpha Four provide features which not only allow you touse the database to generate form letters, but also provide a rudimentaryword processor so you can write the text of the letter.andP;  This means you don'thave to go off and learn how to use the (usually complicated) forms letterfeature in your word processor.andM;This feature also nods in the direction of what's coming to be known asdatabase publishing.andP;  It should be noted that neither Delta Five nor AlphaFour can be considered true database publishing packages - they'd need tooffer more comprehensive layout controls, different type fonts and much more.andO;But they give a clear indication of the sort of features that will soonbecome obligatory for all database packages - regardless of which end of themarket they're aimed at.andM;Both programs were reviewed under MS/DOS 3.2 on a 4Mb CompuAdd 386 (16Mb)with a 40Mb hard disk and a full-colour VGA monitor.andP;  A limited review wasalso carried out on an Olivetti M211V laptop (more because it was availablethan for its suitability as a platform).andP;  The programs performed adequatelyon both machines and no untrapped errors were encountered.andM;Delta FiveandM;Delta Five is a classic PC database package.andP;  It provides features fordefining database files, setting up screens for data entry and display andextracting and sorting data files, as well as advance programming featuresfor budding full-scale user applications with custom menus and macros.andP;  Thepackage is described by its supplier as both a transactional and a relationaldatabase.andM;This means that it can be used for old-fashioned data processing applications(such as invoicing, order processing, stock control and so on) which arebased on the entry and processing of transactions- the transactional side.andO;But its relational features also allow for the data querying, analysis andextraction processes required in modern personal computing.andM;As far as users are concerned, this matters little.andP;  Delta Five, though, islikely to be used as an advanced programming tool, and this flexibility indatabase structure can be a useful bonus.andM;The transactional side of Delta Five can be used effectively for  capturing'data in classic business data processing applications.andP;  This same data canthen be used in analysis applications by employing Delta Five's relationalfeatures.andM;PackagingandM;Delta Five is attractively presented and has a fine set of documentation -although, annoyingly, the weighty, shrink-wrapped reference manual set wasn'tpunched with the appropriate holes for the binder.andP;  Both 3 1/2-inch and 5 1/4-inch floppy disks are provided with every package.andP;  Further documentation onnetwork administration is provided with the network version (not tested) andthe program can be downloaded over a network.andM;Like most modern software, Delta Five is easy to set up.andP;  The master disk isinserted in your A: drive (or equivalent) and the magic word Install willinvoke the appropriate sequence of screens and options.andM;One neat feature of Delta Five is that the configuration is effectivelydynamic.andP;  A master menu option gives access to a 'configuration' sub-menu,which allows the standard changes to be made.andM;It's refreshing to find a program which allows you to make quite radicalconfiguration changes without going through the entire setup processMicrosoft's products are particularly bad for this).andP;  The configuration menuallows new printers to added and the default directory to be changed, inaddition to the usual customisation of the screen and function key settings.andM;Delta Five isn't copy protected - although it's subject to the usualcopyright and licensing restrictions.andM;In useandM;Delta Five's appearance can best be described as functional.andP;  As is often thecase with UK-originated products, a lot of attention has been focused on whatgoes on under the covers, while the outward appearance is almost anafterthought.andM;Delta Five provides uncluttered, standard screen presentation.andP;  When in itsmenu system, the menus are presented using the full body of the screenstarting with a status line across the bottom.andM;The status fine identifies the current database, its access rights andtoday's date, in addition to any system message or further choices which canbe made.andM;Compsoft could improve the menu system by introducing consistency between themenu body - where choices are made by selecting an identifying letter(A,B,C,D and so on) - and the sub-menu choices which appear in the status box- where choices are made according to the first letter of the function (Q forQuit, E for Edit).andP;  Both methods are perfectly valid, but it can be confusingwhen you have to swap between the two.andM;Custom-built screen layouts can be easily created with Delta Five's screeneditor.andP;  An automatic field naming feature is provided which makes it quickand easy to set up data entry or query display screens.andP;  These screens can bebuilt into applications created with the Delta Five process editor.andP;  This issimilar to a straightforward program source code editor which can be used tobuild code modules and menus.andM;Although Delta Five offers a great deal of power, it presents it in nice,compact, easy-to-digest chunks.andP;  You can start using the program almostimmediately.andP;  The menu structure, despite its awkward access, is logical, andfunctions are grouped together in a useful and predictable way.andM;Compsoft has gone to great lengths to describe all the processes involved indesigning and writing programs in the excellent documentation.andP;  And thecontext-sensitive on-line help feature gives users immediate access todescriptions of the more advanced parts of the package.andM;Compsoft must be congratulated on its short and concise introduction to theprinciples of system design for business data processing.andP;  Other databasesuppliers could benefit from placing more emphasis on general principles intheir documentation.andM;The on-line help feature is so comprehensive that Compsoft hasn't provided anon-line tutorial with Delta Five.andP;  it can be configured at three differentlevels at load time.andP;  The fun help system used in the review proved to be anadequate substitute for a tutorial - although some users might prefer a moreenforced CBT approach.andM;Alpha FourandM;Alpha Four is a simple yet powerful personal database management package.andP;  Itprovides both  forms' views and  list'  spreadsheet) views of data,relational capabilities, data manipulation and application-building tools.andM;It scores highly in ease of use, while offering advanced programming featuresand a built-in word processor.andM;The product comes in an attractive package which includes both 3 1/2-inch and5 1/4-inch floppy disks, a reference manual and a tutorial manual.andM;The program was easy to set up and required 1.8Mb for program files.andP;  LikeDelta Five, Alpha Four provides dynamic configuration changing, so you canadd printers, change screen colours and so on without the need to go throughthe installation procedure.andP;  The program isn't copy protected - although itis, of course, subject to the usual copyright and licensing restrictions.andM;In useandM;Alpha Four makes good use of the screen, and it's obvious that attention hasbeen lavished on presenting information in a way that's easy on the eye.andP;  itdoesn't make excessive use of colour or highlighting, though.andM;The program tends to use terse screens with a small amount of information onthem.andP;  This means you might have to go through several screens in order toget exactly what you're looking for, but, because keyboard usage is natural,this doesn't seem to create too many problems.andM;Menu choices are usually made from the screen using the first letter of thefunction (P for Print, S for Search and so on).andP;  When further choices orgeneral functions  Help, Exit) are required, the function keys are used.andO;Alpha Four uses the Escape key very well, so you can backtrack through themenus and sub-menus you've recently accessed.andM;It's gratifying to see that F1 is used as the Help key (as indeed it was,with Delta Five) and that the quality of the help routines is excellent.andP;  TheHelp windows are context-sensitive and each one is numbered with a referencenumber that corresponds with the manual (although the quality of on-line helpavailable is usually high enough to make this process unnecessary).andM;Alpha Four doesn't provide a screen editor, so you have to specify the formatof entry and enquiry screens when you specify the fields in the databasedesign stage.andP;  They appear on the screen in the order specified - each onestarting on a new fine.andP;  Some users may find this isn't to their liking - butthere's no doubt it simplifies things greatly and is adequate for the task.andM;It's relatively easy to change field positions in the database definition ifyou want to change the order in which fields are presented on screen.andM;Alpha Four provides a number of features for processing data - although mostusers would probably want to use it for simple data analysis rather thanheavy batch processing applications.andM;ConclusionandM;One of the frustrations of reviewing two packages side by side is that someof the features taken from one package and placed other would make it perfect- and  vice-versa.andP;  Alpha Four's interface and presentation, combined with DeltaandM;Five's  background functionality and multi-user features, would make aformidable product.andP;  Given that Delta Five is aimed further up market thanAlpha Four, it's probably unfair to compare them too closely.andM;If you want the full multi-user networking features of Delta Five, then AlphaFour will be of little use to you.andP;  If, however, you're looking for a usefulpersonal database with plenty of scope for future expansion, then eitherpackage will do.andM;Alpha Four is definitely easier to use - but it lacks a full screen editor(many wouldn't see this as a fault).andP;  Delta Five has greater functionalityand is more traditional in its approach to applications building.andM;Both packages perform wen, offer plenty of import and export options, andtake database packages another step nearer overall comprehensiveness with theword processing and spreadsheet calculation features.andP;  it would be nice tosee these features extended in future versions.andM;On the downside, neither Delta Five nor Alpha Four can compare to the newbreed of graphics-intensive database packages (Omnis, Excel and so on) inpresentation capabilities.andP;  I suspect that this might make it hard for themto gain headway in the market.andM;Specifications:andM;Delta FiveandM;* Hardware needs: IBM PC with 512Kb and above  640Kb recommended).andP;  Harddisk.andP;
