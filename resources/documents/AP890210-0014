ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Inaugural addresses are the style, but budgetsare the substance of new administrations. With his first spendingplan, George Bush completed the transition from the Reagan to theBush presidency.   ``I don't propose to reverse direction,'' Bush told the nationThursday night in a televised speech to a joint session of Congress.   What he set forth was a shift in direction, not a reversal or asharp turn. While the direction remained conservative, it was adirection that was clearly his own.   A dependence on growth and an opposition to taxes remainedcentral to his plan for the economy. He stood fast on Star Wars.   But in many of the priorities and most clearly in the tone, thiswas George Bush, not Ronald Reagan.   Compare their views of government.   ``Government is not the solution to the problem. Government isthe problem,'' said Reagan, early in his presidency.   ``We in government cannot stand on the sidelines,'' said Bush,when he turned to homelessness.   The new president's budget offers tangible reminders of hiscampaign pledges to become ``the education president'' and encouragea ``kinder, gentler nation.''   He rejected Reagan's proposal to cut $1.7 billion from theMedicaid health program for the poor. He proposed increased speningfor the Head Start preschool program as well as a new merit awardprogram for schools and increased subsidies for black colleges.   At the same time, however, Bush accepted his predecessor's planto cut $5 billion from Medicare, the corresponding health programfor the elderly, and his overall education budget fails to keep pacewith inflation.   The overall numbers, in fact, vary little from Reagan's budget.But the changes that Bush did make were carefully designed to showmovement.   Hence, Bush's call for a child care tax credit of $1,000 for poorfamilies and for an expanded $3,000 tax deduction for adoptionexpenses _ the types of programs Reagan so often was accused ofneglecting.   Not only did Bush walk away from Reagan's proposal to increasemilitary spending by 2 percent above the rate of inflation, but hedropped his predecessor's militant rhetoric on Central America.   For nearly his entire eight-year presidency, Reagan waged acrusade against the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, a campaignthat resulted in the major scandal of his administration, the effortto channel covert funds to the anti-government Contra forces.   Reagan devoted some of his strongest rhetoric to condemning theSandinistas and praising the Contras.   This was Bush's only reference to the conflict: ``We must standfirm for self-determination and democracy in Central America __including in Nicaragua.''   There was a new emphasis on preventing the spread of nuclearweapons.   But Bush did not turn away from his predecessor's plan toestablished a space-based missile defense system.   ``I will vigorously pursue the Strategic Defense Initiative,'' hesaid.   The seeds of conflict with the Democratic Congress were present.   His plan for a cut in capital gains taxes is certain to get acool reception. His belief that economic growth will provide newjobs and pay for new social programs surely will be tested byuncertainty about whether that growth can long be sustained.   But while Reagan often fostered conflict, even with congressionalRepublicans, over his budget proposals, the new president went outof his way to keep relations smooth.   He recalled his own brief service in the House chamber and said:``I feel as if I am returning home to friends.''   He continued: ``I intend in the months and years to come, to giveyou what friends deserve: frankness, respect, and my best judgmentabout ways to improve America's future.''   Welcome words to a Congress often locked in confrontation withhis predecessor.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Donald M.
