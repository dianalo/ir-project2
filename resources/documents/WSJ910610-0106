The agency hopes to leverage its shrinking bank-rescuefund by attracting private investors with new capital andmanagement skills to the banking business. In addition, FDICChairman William Seidman wants to use public bank assistanceto promote greater banking efficiency through consolidations.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's definitely a match-making function to beperformed&quot; by the FDIC, said Harrison Young, the agency'sdirector of resolutions. Mr. Young said the FDIC isconsidering holding a series of Wall Street seminars withpotential investors such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.,investment banks and management experts to cultivate investorinterest.   &quot;We have to make it easier for investors to get qualified&quot;to purchase bank assets, Mr. Young said.   The FDIC already is concentrating on using private-publicfunding to rescue and consolidate insolvent banks in NewHampshire and other Northeastern states. But the agency alsois considering earlier intervention to prevent banks fromfailing in the first place.   &quot;If you've got a bank that's probably going to fail in 18months and the alternative is watching it shrink gradually .. . you could save the fund huge amounts of money&quot; byinvesting early enough to stabilize the bank before it beginsto teeter toward collapse, Mr. Young said.   FDIC proposals for more aggressive use of such so-calledopen bank assistance are still evolving. The ideas raise aseries of complex legal issues about what happens to themanagement, stockholders and bondholders in the bank that'sbeing shored up with government funds. The FDIC is reluctantto help banks in a way that appears to protect shareholdersand management from loss.   Open bank assistance currently is rare, but with bankfailures running at the rate of close to 200 a year, the FDICthinks it may be cheaper to head off failures than toliquidate failed banks. A bank's assets decline sharply invalue as soon as it closes.   Mr. Young stressed that the FDIC would use open bankassistance only in combination with private investment. &quot;Ithink the board would only do it where there is marketvalidation through a merger or an outside buyer,&quot; he said.&quot;These kind of transactions have to come to us.&quot;   While the FDIC plans to invite investors to propose suchtransactions, Mr. Young acknowledged that they will bedifficult to arrange. &quot;Outside-of-bankruptcy reorganizationsare very hard to do,&quot; he said. &quot;It's hard for management tomake such a decision.&quot;   The FDIC is grappling with how to make private investmentin weak banks more attractive. In the past, the agency hasdemanded controlling blocks of stock and broad authority overoperations when it helps struggling banks. But Mr. Young saidthe agency might accept less control to reward investors whotake on considerable financial risk.   &quot;We'll be leaning in the direction of people willing totake a little more risk,&quot; he said. &quot;The more risk they take,the less control we will have to exert.&quot; As an example, hecited a hypothetical $1 billion bank that needs $75 million.If an investor agreed to put in half, he said, &quot;we wouldprobably want some control over dividends&quot; the bank wouldpay, but would leave many operational details up to themanagement.</TEXT></DOC>
