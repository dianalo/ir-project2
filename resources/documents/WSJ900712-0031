The statement came at the conclusion of the nations' 16thannual economic summit, at which the U.S. and its allies alsodecided to take divergent approaches on such issues asproviding aid to the Soviet Union and preserving theenvironment.</LP><TEXT>   President Bush cast the summit's results in a positivelight. He said the summit nations had pledged to take&quot;difficult steps&quot; to conclude a new world trade treaty. Andhe said the meeting should please Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev, whom he contacted immediately after the finalsession to outline the results. In an ironic sign of theWest's growing stake in Mr. Gorbachev's political survival,Mr. Bush also congratulated the Soviet leader on his&quot;landslide&quot; re-election this week as head of the SovietCommunist Party.   The agreement on agriculture came after more than sevenhours of negotiations concluding early yesterday morning.Officials from the U.S., Canada, West Germany, France,Britain, Italy, Japan and the European Community agreed toassert in part that a future pact on agricultural trade&quot;should contain specific assurances that . . . participantswould reduce not only internal support but also exportsubsidies and import protection in a related way.&quot;   &quot;If it's not a breakthrough, it's progress,&quot; said U.S.Trade Representative Carla Hills. She especially cited thelanguage specifically calling for reduction in the threetypes of farm subsidies, internal, export subidies and importprotection. The U.S. has sought a commitment, particularlyfrom European Community nations, that each of these threetypes of subsidy be reduced.   But the language didn't call for the elimination of exportsubsidies, something the U.S. has sought. As a result, someEuropean participants claimed victory.   The president of the European Community, Jacques Delors,said, &quot;There's no victory, there's only a good compromise.&quot;He said that the EC now is negotiating on all the aspects ofagricultural policy, while the U.S. and others now understandthat agriculture has a special social and political role inEurope.   President Bush suggested the summit accord will improvethe prospects for a successful conclusion to the currentround of world trade talks being held under the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. &quot;Each of us recognizes thatreaching this goal {of successfully concluding the tradetalks} will require difficult steps by all participants,&quot; Mr.Bush said. &quot;We won't hesitate to take them. This isespecially true for agriculture. We are committed by thisdeclaration to provide the strong political leadershipnecessary to ensure a strong and enduring result.&quot;   U.S. officials, though, made it clear that much bargaininglies ahead. &quot;We're going to have a very tough negotiation,&quot;said Mrs. Hills. &quot;It doesn't mean they've leapt into ourlaps.&quot;   The world trade talks, which began in Uruguay in 1986, areset to wind up this December. They are an attempt to extendthe GATT treaty to cover agriculture and textiles and toaddress new issues, including intellectual property rights,services and trade-related investments.   The U.S. side also was pleased that the summiteerscommended to their negotiators a recent text put forward bythe chairman of the GATT agriculture negotiating group, Aartde Zeeuw.   Some European nations have been leery of that proposalbecause it differentiates between various types ofagricultural subsidy. The EC has generally favored groupingall agricultural subsidies together before reducing them.Farm-exporting nations such as the U.S., Canada, Argentinaand many other developing countries fear that would lead to afailure to address export subsidies and price supports, whichmany economists believe most distort trade.   On many issues, the summit leaders glossed overdifferences they brought to the meeting. Though they spentmuch time discussing conditions in the Soviet Union, theywere unable to agree on a common strategy for aiding Mr.Gorbachev's beleaguered economy, except to applaud hisrestructuring program and to continue to offer him &quot;technicalassistance&quot; in moving toward a market-oriented economy.Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady characterized thediscussions about assistance to the Soviet Union as &quot;verypositive.&quot;   The group resisted West Germany's request to join now in aunited package of direct aid to the Soviets. On Tuesday, thegroup agreed to commission a study of the Soviet economy by agroup of international financial institutions. That study,which probably will be led by the International MonetaryFund, would provide &quot;the criteria for any assistance, so longas we can ensure it's properly targeted,&quot; said British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher.   In a meeting with reporters, President Bush forcefullyruled out direct aid until the Soviets restructure theireconomy, scale back their military arsenal and reduce theirsupport for left-wing dictatorships.   &quot;We're going to try in every way to facilitate that reformbecause we are in a different age,&quot; the president said. &quot;Butwe have some problems. I'm not particularly enthusiasticabout the {Soviet} intercontinental ballistic missiles aimedat U.S. cities. I find it a little contradictory to thinkthat they will continue to spend $5 billion a year for Cuba.&quot;   Several leaders said their differences reflect that theworld has become more secure. &quot;With the threat from theSoviet world considerably reduced, because of that Europe ismore able to assert its personality,&quot; said French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand. But he added: &quot;We don't want a situationin which the EC exercises a sort of competitive leadershipwith the U.S.&quot;   The other leading topic at the summit was the environment.The summit leaders, as they did on Soviet aid, agreed toseveral minimum common goals while opting to pursue their owndomestic strategies for curbing pollution and preserving theenvironment.   The final communique singled out global climate change asa subject of &quot;key importance&quot; and committed the nations to&quot;undertake common efforts to limit emissions of greenhousegases such as carbon dioxide.&quot; Many scientists believe thatthe buildup of such gases in the atmosphere is causing anincrease in the Earth's temperature. West Germany hascommitted itself to a 25% reduction in the level of carbondioxide emissions by the year 2000. But the other summitcountries won't adopt such stringent goals without additionalresearch, and the communique didn't set a specific target forthe group.   The communique also called for additional research onclimate change and for a phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons,which are believed to reduce the earth's protective ozonelayer, by the year 2000. The leaders also pledged to helpdeveloping nations preserve tropical rain forests and todevelop strategies for reforestation. And they promised tolaunch negotiations aimed at a world agreement by 1992 topreserve forest land.   U.S. environmentalists complained that the leadersdeliberately had played down environmental issues. Mr. Bushdismissed the accusation, saying, &quot;On the environmentalextreme, they don't want this country to grow.&quot; But even somesummit leaders acknowledged that there is much left to do.Commenting on greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions,Mrs. Thatcher said: &quot;That's the part we haven't reallytackled yet, that's the part that's difficult.&quot;   The 17-page communique commended the movement towardfree-market democracies in Eastern Europe and toward greaterEuropean integration. It also welcomed a unified Germany andadvocated more discipline to curb trade-distortingexport-credit subsidies.   The summit praised the current system of internationaleconomic policy coordination, endorsed current internationaldebt strategy and commended the recently announced U.S.initiative to help Latin American countries. The U.S. expectsother nations will support the initiative, but they need timeto study it, Mr. Brady noted. As a gesture to debtorcountries making strong economic reform efforts, the summitalso encouraged the Paris Club, a group of western creditornations, to lengthen the repayment period on governmentcredits.   And in a nod to Japan, the summit took note of theimportance to that country of &quot;a peaceful resolution of itsdispute with the Soviet Union over the northern territories,&quot;some small islands seized by the Russians in 1945.   ---   Tim Carrington contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
