(tutorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Brinkmann, Ron M.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Graphics workstations typically include a transform engine, aspecialized floating point processor to convert 3-D imageinformation into a 2-D screen image; a multiplane frame buffer forstoring and manipulating images; and a video converter which readsframe buffer data and converts it to video scan information.andP;  Suchworkstations also have high-resolution displays, typically1280-by-1024 pixels, and large, nondisplayable banks of fastscreen memory useful for such processes as fast generation ofbit-mapped text, texture mapping and pattern tiling.andP;  The screenmemory (or frame buffer) employs such techniques as screen depth,the number of bits of data each pixel contains; double buffering,which is used for smoothly animating a rapidly changing image;z-buffering, which keeps track of pixel depth values; alphabuffering, which assigns a transparency value to pixels; andoverlay and control planes.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Three-Dimensional GraphicsBufferingFunctionsUtilization.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Typical graphics workstation.
