After a year of freedom from South African control,Namibia remains the target of sanctions by 39 Americanlocalities. And the Namibian experience doesn't bode well forneighboring South Africa, which may find itself beset withlocal sanctions even after federal government measures havebeen lifted. South Africa has been moving to end its systemof racial separation, or apartheid; international sanctions,including those imposed by Washington, helped bring thatabout.</LP><TEXT>   But, says William Swing, the U.S. ambassador to SouthAfrica, &quot;In point of fact, the sanctions which this {SouthAfrican} government is probably most concerned about -- anumber of them lie outside the (U.S.) ComprehensiveAnti-Apartheid Act of 1986.&quot; He adds, &quot;One thing they areconcerned about is how long will it take for state and localsanctions to be removed.&quot;   State and local sanctions against South Africa and Namibiaoften take the form of prohibiting companies that do businesswith either country from doing business with the locality.Other laws prohibit the investment of pension fund oruniversity endowment money in companies operating in the twocountries.   Namibia was included in those laws because until last yearit was administered by South Africa, in violation of UnitedNations and World Court rulings. But, according to theInvestor Responsibility Research Center, four states, sevencounties and 28 cities still punish Namibia as though itremains under apartheid rule.   &quot;It's the ignorance of the people concerned,&quot; lamentsNamibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob, as he lists numerousmeasures his goverment has taken to encourage foreigninvestment. &quot;We see that as a lasting solution rather thanhandouts.&quot;   On the IRRC list of places with sanctions against Namibiaare Maryland, Oregon, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., AlamedaCounty, Calif., and Dade County, Florida. In a letter togovernors and local officials, the State Department urgedthem &quot;to terminate measures they have imposed that areinconsistent with good economic relations between the UnitedStates and Namibia.&quot;   &quot;It's really unfair,&quot; complains Bill Moses, of the IRRC, anonactivist, research organization in Washington. &quot;Thesepeople fought for their freedom in a long civil war. A lot ofpeople died, they're democratic, they're free market orientedand they want investment, but people won't give it to thembecause they're afraid they won't be able to sell toiletpaper to a local school district.&quot;   South African sanctions by 85 cities, 22 counties and 26states may fall relatively more quickly than did the Namibianones, because South Africa has far more visibility. But theremay be a significant difference of opinion between local andfederal officials as to when the time is right to removesanctions.   Strong black constituencies, labor unions and otheractivist groups may demand the retention of local sanctionslong after the conditions allowing repeal of the federal lawhave been met. Local officials don't think President Bush orSouth African President F.W. de Klerk &quot;are the arbiters ofchange,&quot; Mr. Moses explains. &quot;It's the people who areoppressed.&quot;   Indeed, even as there is increased talk about the removalof U.S. government and European sanctions, state and localgovernments are making their efforts stronger. Los Angelesvoters approved a charter amendment last November thatextends the city's anti-apartheid contracting policy toinclude competitively bid contracts over $25,000. Last month,New Jersey Gov. James Florio told the state's TurnpikeAuthority not to renew a contract with Shell Oil Co. becauseits parent company does business in South Africa.   Many state and city government officers say they areencouraged by recent changes in South Africa. MargaretCarter, a Democratic state representative in Oregon whospearheaded a state sanctions bill in 1987, notes withapproval such things as the release of political prisonersand the legalization of the African National Congress.   But state and local officials aren't yet willing toreverse their anti-apartheid policies. In many cases, theywant a signal from the South African democratic movementbefore they move to dismantle sanctions. &quot;Since the ANC hasnot yet said it's time to lift {South African} sanctions,&quot;says Khalid Lum, director of public information for NewHaven, &quot;I doubt that resolution would carry in the board ofalderman.&quot; Other state and city officials say they willfollow the lead of the State Department or the CongressionalBlack Caucus.   But the sluggish response of many state and localgovernments to Namibia's independence and an ignorance ofsouthern African affairs does not auger rapid reaction to thetime when democracy becomes inevitable in South Africa.   &quot;Is Namibia part of South Africa?&quot; asks George Nicolaides,administrator of the Fort Worth city retirement fund, whenquestioned about the city's continuing sanctions againstNamibia. Informed that it is now an independent state, Mr.Nicolaides says, &quot;I don't know about that,&quot; and adds thematter has not yet come before the fund's board of trustees.   In some cases, the stumbling block to quick action hasbeen politics. Maryland Del. Howard &quot;Pete&quot; Rawlings triedlast year to remove Namibian sanctions. But when he rose tointroduce the measure he upset Del. Nathaniel Exum, a fellowDemocrat who had sponsored the original sanction bill -- andwho was unaware that Namibia had since become independent.   &quot;I committed a kind of political faux pas,&quot; says Mr.Rawlings, who says he should have paid Mr. Exum the courtesyof advance warning. Mr. Rawlings agreed not to press thematter further, while Mr. Exum, newly informed of Namibia'sindependence, agreed to take up the cause. Unfortunately, Mr.Exum says he forgot until earlier this month, when hereceived the State Department letter. Although Mr. Exumhastily submitted a bill, he says it is now too late in thelegislative session for the measure to pass this year.</TEXT></DOC>
