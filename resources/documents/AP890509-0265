Subroto, secretary general of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, made the remarks upon arriving on a flightfrom Frankfurt to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.   Subroto, accompanied by his personal secretary, said he wouldmeet Wednesday morning with Texas Railroad Commissioner Kent Hanceat a breakfast session. Hance's commission regulates the Texas oilindustry and he has been an active observer of OPEC meetinggs inthe past.   ``The message is that the member countries are striving towardprice stability'' at about $18 per barrel, Subroto said.   It was Subroto's first American appearance since taking the OPECjob last July. He was scheduled to address a Thursday luncheonsponsored by Southern Methodist University's Institute for theStudy of Earth and Man in his only planned U.S. talk this year.   Subroto's presentation, ``Long-term Prospects for OilStability,'' at the Fairmont Hotel in Dallas was expected toattract an estimated 1,000 oil and gas industry representatives andothers from the Southwest.   Formerly Indonesia's minister of mines and energy, Subroto wascredited with developing a production agreement signed by OPECmembers. The pact has prompted an increase in oil prices since lastNovember.   Subroto said he believed the performance of OPEC membercountries based on that agreement was ``pretty satisfactory.''   Based in Vienna, Austria, OPEC's 13 member countries have beeninstrumental in setting and maintaining worldwide oil prices.   The organization has been watched closely by other petroleumproducing countries in anticipation of OPEC's June 5 meeting inVienna. Oil analysts have expressed concern following a 50 percentprice increase in past months and production levels that appear tobe rising.   Strong demand has caused oil price rallies, with the latestcoming last week after reports of a delay in repairing the NorthSea's Cormorant Alpha platform, hit by an April 18 explosion.</TEXT></DOC>
