Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from October 23, 1989 through November 3, 1989. The last biweeklynotice was published on November 1, 1989 (54 FR 46138). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,and should cite the publication date and page number of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By December 15, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 whichis available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Local Public DocumentRoom for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing orpetition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commissionor an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission orby the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will ruleon the request and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated AtomicSafety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriateorder. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consistof a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the basesof the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expertopinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intendsto rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must alsoprovide references to those specific sources and documents of which thepetitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establishthose facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient informationto show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a materialissue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within thescope of the amendments under consideration. The contention must be onewhich, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Arizona Public Service Company, et al., Docket Nos. STN 50-528, STN50-529 and STN 50-530, Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS), Units1, 2 and 3, Maricopa County, Arizona </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>October 10, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendments wouldmodify the Technical Specifications (Appendix A to Facility Operating LicenseNos. NPF-41, NPF-51 and NPF-74 of PVNGS Units 1, 2 and 3 respectively),Section 3.3.2, ``Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) Instrumentation.''One of the requirements of this specification is that the turbine-drivenAuxiliary Feedwater Pump (AFW) pump must be periodically tested for ESFASresponse time. The proposed amendments would exclude this pump from ESFASresponse time testing until Mode 3 conditions are reached. This exclusionis similar to that which is already provided under Limiting Condition forOperation (LCO) 3.7.1.2 which allows for entry into Mode 3 to perform theoperability test on the turbine-driven AFW pump. <T3>Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendments against these standardsand has provided the following discussions: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 1</T3> -Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed Technical Specification change will not result in a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of any accidents previouslyevaluated. The change involves the addition of an exemption from Specification4.0.4 for ESFAS response time testing of the turbine-driven AFW pump. Thiswould allow for entry into Mode 3 prior to performing the response timetesting. In Mode 3, the proper plant conditions exist for performing thetesting of this pump. The proposed change does not impact the probabilityof occurrence of any initiating event for previously analyzed accidents.Additionally, the proposed change will provide consistency between thedifferent Technical Specifications. LCO 3.7.1.2 currently provides a 4.0.4exemption which allows the unit to enter Mode 3 prior to establishing operabilityof this pump. Therefore, this change will not affect the current operabilityrequirements for the turbine-driven AFW pump. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 2</T3> -Create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. No physical modificationsare being made to the existing plant equipment. The turbine-driven AFWpump cannot be properly tested until the appropriate conditions are reachedin the secondary plant. This occurs in Mode 3. This testing limitationis already incorporated into LCO 3.7.1.2 but was not incorporated intoLCO 3.3.2. Therefore, this change will provide consistency between theLCOs and incorporate a previously recognized testing limitation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 3</T3> -Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in amargin of safety. The change extends an allowance that is already providedfor in the Technical Specifications. Per LCO 3.7.1.2, operability of theturbine-driven AFW pump must be established prior to Mode 2 entry. Thissame operability requirement should be applied to the ESFAS response timetesting requirements of LCO 3.3.2. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensees' no significant hazards analysis andconcurs with their conclusions.

Knighton <ITAG tagnum="84">Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-237 and 249, Dresden NuclearPower Station, Unit Nos. 2 and 3, Grundy County, Illinois </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendment request: </T3>September 29, 1989<T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>Commonwealth Edison Company(CECo) has proposed changes to the Dresden Units 2 and 3 Technical Specifications(TS) to reflect modifications to the Standby Liquid Control System (SLCS)and the addition of a Recirculation Pump Trip (RPT), which have previouslybeen implemented to comply with the requirements of the Anticipated TransientWithout Scram (ATWS) Rule (10 CFR 50.62). The proposed TS changes related to the SLCS would: (1) replace the boronconcentration curve (Figure 3.4.1) with a minimum allowable volume of 3605gallons and a minimum concentration of 14 weight percent to satisfy therequirement of equivalent capacity of 86 gpm at 13 weight percent; (2)change the SLCS pump flow rate from 39 to 40 gpm for each pump so a totalof 80 gpm would be provided when both pumps are running; (3) add a tanksuction operability test to demonstrate the suction lines are not plugged;(4) increase the system pressure relief setpoint to reflect increased pumpdischarge pressure during two pump operation; (5) increase the sodium pentaboratesolution saturation temperature from 59anddegrees; F to 62anddegrees; F toreflect the weight percent increase in sodium pentaborate and (6) modifythe Bases section of the TS to support the above changes. The proposed TS changes related to the RPT system would: (1) add Section3.2.H ``Recirculation Pump Trip Initiation'' which outlines the LimitingConditions for Operation requirements for this trip function; (2) add Table3.2.7 ``Instrumentation that Initiates Recirculation Pump Trip'' whichcontains operability requirements and trip levels for the RPT system; (3)add Table 4.2.5 `` Minimum Test and Calibration Frequency for the RecirculationPump Trip System'' which contains the calibration frequency for the RPTinstrumentation; and (4) modify the Bases section of the TS to supportthe above changes. These changes are consistent with the modifications made by CECo to satisfythe requirements of the ATWS Rule which have been previously approved bythe NRC staff. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not; (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three standards in the amendment applicationas follows: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated because: a. The proposed SBLC related changes clarify the design basis and maintainthe total amount of boron injection previously required by the TS therebymaintaining the previous shutdown reactivity capability. The proposed changesare needed to reflect implementation of 10 CFR 50.62 and have no impacton systems or equipment that could potentially initiate or increase theprobability of an accident. b. The RPT functions are diverse from the reactor protection system. Failureof these functions will, in no way, impact the ability of the reactor protectionsystem to safely shut down the reactor. Analyses of anticipated transientsand accident conditions have incorporated the RPT on high pressure. Thelow-low reactor water level RPT does not affect LOCA analyses which conservativelyassume the pumps trip immediately (independent of ATWS RPT), while theATWS trip has an associated nine second delay. Therefore, the probabilityor consequences of previously evaluated accidents is unchanged by the proposedamendment. (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated because: a. The SBLC related changes involve a system whose only function is toprovide a backup shutdown capability. The changes do not affect any systemsor equipment which could initiate an accident. b. The primary purpose of the RPT function is to provide a means to quicklyreduce reactor power in the event the reactor protection system fails duringan anticipated transient. Since this system acts as a backup to RPS andfunctions independently from it, no new accident scenario exists. As aresult, the proposed amendment does not create a new or different kindof potential accident scenario. (3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because: a. The overall shutdown reactivity capability (i.e., total boron injection)of the SBLC system is not reduced by these changes. The proposed amendmentreflects modifications which have increased the SBLC system injection rate,thereby increasing the margin of safety for ATWS. b. The margin of safety is assured by operating within the Limiting Conditionsfor Operation defined in the TS. Cycle specific reload analyses for variouspressurization transients, as well as accidents conditions, are performedto establish these operating limits. The RPT on high reactor pressure hasbeen included as input to these analyses. The RPT on low-low reactor waterlevel does not affect LOCA analyses since it is conservatively assumedthat pumps trip immediately (independent of ATWS RPT), whereas the ATWStrip has an associated nine second delay. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationsdeterminations and since neither the SBLC or RPT related changes involvea reduction in safety margins the staff finds it acceptable. Accordingly,the Commission proposes to determine that the change does not involve anysignificant hazards consideration. <ITAG tagnum="84">Consumers Power Company, Docket No. 50-255, Palisades Plant, Van BurenCounty, Michigan </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>September 21, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>This proposed license amendmentwould modify the Palisades Plant Technical Specifications (TS) to removethe organization charts following the guidance provided in the Commission'sGeneric Letter 88-06. The proposed amendment would also make various administrativechanges to Section 6.0 of the TS. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed change against the above standardsas required by 10 CFR 50.91(a). The Commission's staff has reviewed thelicensee's evaluation and agrees with it. The licensee concluded that:(1) The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(1))because those requirements necessary for safe operation relative to organizationmanagement functions and position qualifications have been retained inthe TS. The changes do not eliminate or alter the functions previouslyreviewed and do not affect plant operation and design. (2) The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(2))because the proposed change is administrative in nature. No physical alterationsto the plant or changes affecting plant operation and design are included.The changes create no new accident mode. (3) The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety(10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because, as stated in (1) above, requirements necessaryfor safe plant operation have been retained in the TS. Further, the changesare consistent with the requirements established in previous organizationevaluations. An established licensee quality assurance program provisionsprovide additional controls to assure safe operation. Similar changes have previously been reviewed on a generic basis and werefound acceptable, as documented in Generic Letter 88-06. The changes proposedby the licensee are consistent with the guidance contained in GL 88-06.The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination analysis. Based on this review, the staff proposes to determinethat the proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Van Zoeren Library, HopeCollege, Holland, Michigan 49423. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Judd L.

Change (4) regarding changes to the TS3.4.4 Action Statements and Change (6) regarding the addition of the word``path'' to TS 4.7.1.2.2 are being handled separately. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes covered by this notice are administrative in natureand do not involve a significant hazards consideration because: 1. They do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated because these changes are administrativein nature. As such, these changes do not involve any hardware changes tothe Catawba facility and do not affect the capability of the Catawba facilityto preclude, mitigate, or withstand the effects of those postulated eventsanalyzed or evaluated as part of the Catawba licensing basis. 2. They do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.These administrative changes do not involve any facility design or operationalchanges, and therefore no new failure modes, operational configurations,or equipment vulnerabilities are introduced. 3. They do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. As stated above,these changes do not affect the capability of the Catawba facility to preclude,mitigate, or withstand the effects of any previously analyzed event consideredin the licensing basis for Catawba. Therefore, current margins of safetyremain unchanged. On this basis, the Commission has determined that the requested changescovered by this notice meet the three standards and, therefore, proposesto determine that the amendment application does not involve a significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>York County Library, 138East Black Street, Rock Hill, South Carolina 29730 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>David B. Matthews <ITAG tagnum="84">Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal ElectricAuthority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia, Docket Nos. 50-424 and 50-425,Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, Units 1 and 2, Burke County, Georgia</ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>August 25, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendments to theTechnical Specification (TS) would revise the rod insertion limits to showthe fully withdrawn position as 222 steps instead of 228 steps. The purposeof the change in the insertion limit is to allow a periodic change, withinthe range of 222 to 231 steps withdrawn, of the parked full out positionof the control rods which will minimize the effects of control rod wearcaused by fretting against upper internal control rod guide surfaces. TS3.1.3.4, ``Rod Drop Time,'' will also be revised to assure that controlrod drop time measurements are made from the physical fully withdrawn position(231 steps withdrawn). In addition, a revision to TS 5.3.2 is being proposedthat will indicate that control rods may utilize an absorber material ofeither hafnium or silver-indium-cadmium. The specific TS changes are asfollows: 1. In TS 3.1.3.4 for control rod drop time, the word ``physical'' is insertedinto the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) such that it states ``Theindividual shutdown and control rod drop time from the physical fully withdrawnposition...'' 2. In TS 3.1.3.5 for shutdown rod insertion limits, the LCO is restatedas ``All shutdown rods shall be withdrawn to a position greater than orequal to 222 steps'' instead of ``All shutdown rods shall be fully withdrawn.''In the Action statement, the phrase ``not fully withdrawn'' is replacedby ``inserted to a position less than 222 steps,'' and the phrase ``Fullywithdraw the rod, or'' is replaced by ``withdraw the rod to a positiongreater than or equal to 222 steps, or.'' 3. In TS 4.1.3.5, the Surveillance Requirement for Shutdown Rod InsertionLimit, the phrase ``Each shutdown rod shall be determined to be fully withdrawn:''is replaced by ``Each shutdown rod shall be determined to be withdrawnto a position greater than or equal to 222 steps:.'' 4. TS Figure 3.1-3, ``Rod Bank Insertion Limits Versus Thermal Power,''is replaced with a Figure that is identical except that it shows the fullywithdrawn position as 222 instead of 228. 5. In TS 4.10.1.1, the phrase ``each control rod either partially or fullywithdrawn'' is changed to ``each control rod not fully inserted.'' 6. In the bases for TS 3/4.2.2 and 3/4.2.3, part ``b'' is replaced with``Control rod banks are sequenced with a constant tip-to-tip distance betweenbanks as defined by Figure 3.1-3.'' 7. In TS 5.3.2, the description of the absorber composition is revisedby inserting the phrase ``and/or 80% silver, 15% indium, and 5% cadmium.''<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92.

The purpose of the change is to remove apotential source of single failure unit trips and provide a reduction inchallenges to the reactor protection system (RPS). <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). The licenseehas determined and the staff agrees that the proposed amendment will not:1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously analyzed. The one out of four RCPBP trip above P-8 is not required for safety butis instead provided as a redundant anticipatory trip for impending lossof reactor coolant flow and is intended to enhance the overall reliabilityof the RPS. No credit is taken for this trip in the safety analysis foreither Unit 1 or Unit 2. The design protection for the single loop lossof flow event is the low flow reactor trip. The updated FSAR analysis isfor the single loop loss of flow event that assumes that the reactor istripped by the low flow reactor trip and shows that the DNBR remains aboveapplicable limits during the event. Since no credit is taken for the RCPBPtrip, the proposed change to this trip will not impact the safety analysisfor the Cook Nuclear Plant and will, therefore, not increase the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated, or As noted in Criterion 1, the one out of four RCPBP trip above P-8 is notrequired for safety but is provided as a redundant anticipatory trip toenhance the overall reliability of the RPS. In addition, Westinghouse hasconcluded that the change does not degrade the performance of the reactorprotection system or its conformance to system functional requirementsand that the diversity and redundancy of the system is maintained for thesingle loop loss of flow event. The licensee concludes and the staff agreesthat the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident than any previously evaluated. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposedmodification to the RCPBP trip affects only the coincidence logic of thereactor protection system and does not degrade either its performance orconformance to system functional requirements. In addition, Westinghousehas concluded that the diversity and redundancy of the reactor protectionsystem is maintained for the single loop loss of flow event. We, therefore,conclude that the proposed change will not significantly decrease a marginof safety. The Commission has provided guidance concerning the determination of nosignificant hazards consideration by providing certain examples (48 FR14869) of amendments considered not likely to involve significant hazardsconsideration. The sixth of these examples refers to changes which mayresult in some increase to the probability or consequences of a previouslyanalyzed accident, but the results of which are within limits establishedas acceptable. Based on the licensees arguments, the staff has made a proposeddetermination that the application for amendment involves no significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Maude Preston Palenske MemorialLibrary, 500 Market Street, St. Joseph, Michigan 49085. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Charnoff, Esq., Shaw, Pittman, Pottsand Trowbridge, 2300 N Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John Thoma, Acting. <ITAG tagnum="84">Indiana Michigan Power Company, Dockets Nos. 50-315 and 50-316, DonaldC.

The proposed deletion of the Specification 6.4.2 from TS is intended toalleviate the inconsistency between TS requirements for fire brigade trainingand the requirements of Standard TS (STS) and the current fire brigadetraining program. An increase in the probability or consequence of an accidentpreviously evaluated due to the decreased frequency of fire brigade training,if it existed, would be insignificant. Fire brigade training conductedon a quarterly basis is consistent with NRC guidance and STS and will producea similar level of skill and knowledge as would result from monthly training.(2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated, or The change introduces no new operating conditions or changes on the firebrigade function. The current plant fire brigade training will continueto be conducted on a quarterly basis. Therefore, the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any previously evaluated does not exist.(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Previous analysis indicated that threeof the four pairs were required to provide adequate vacuum relief capabilityto protect the structural integrity of the containment for all postulatedevents. The fourth pair provided redundancy in the event that a singleactive failure prevented one valve in any of the three required valve pairsfrom opening. Reanalysis has determined that two pairs, rather than threepairs, of vacuum breaker valves are adequate to protect the structuralintegrity of the containment. Therefore, the licensee proposes to reviseTS Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.4.1 to require a minimumof three pairs of operable vacuum breakers. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration ifoperation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has provided an analysis of no significant hazards considerationswith the request for the license amendment. The licensee's analysis ofthe proposed amendment against the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92 is reproducedbelow: <ITAG tagnum="21">A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The vacuum breaker valves perform their active safety function <T3>after </T3>an accident has occurred. Their failure to open prior toan accident cannot cause an accident to occur, nor does the operabilityof the vacuum breakers have any effect on the operability of other safetyrelated equipment. The operability of the vacuum breakers can affect theconsequences of an accident, since damage to the containment could occurif they did not perform their safety function. We have determined thatthe safety function of protecting containment integrity can be accomplishedwith only two flow paths operable. A redundant vacuum breaker flow pathwould be available in the event a single active failure disables one ofthe three required operable flow paths. Hence, reducing the number of flowpaths required to be operable from four to three would not result in anythreat to containment integrity following an accident, and therefore wouldnot increase the consequences of an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Aside from precluding the possibility of bypass leakage, the onlyfunction the vacuum breaker valves perform is to equalize the pressurebetween the suppression chamber and the drywell. This function serves toprotect the integrity of the containment post-LOCA and can be affectedby reducing the required number of operable vacuum breaker flow paths fromfour to three, as is evaluated in the response to the first standard above.However, no other accident or malfunction can be created by this change.There is no change to the TS requirement that <T3>all </T3>the vacuum breaker valves be in the closed position duringreactor operation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The function of the vacuum breakers is to protect the structural integrityof the containment during a drywell depressurization event. The drywelldesign negative pressure is -5 psig. So long as the vacuum breakers areable to maintain the drywell pressure above this value, drywell integrityis preserved, and the containment function of preventing release of radioactivityis maintained. A computer analysis using flow test data for the actualvacuum breaker valves in the actual configuration used in the plant indicatesthat in the event of an inadvertent drywell spray actuation, the peak negativepressure in the drywell is -4.821 psig with three operable vacuum breakerflowpaths. Repeating the analysis, but reducing the number of operablevacuum breaker flow paths from three to two, results in a calculated peakdrywell negative pressure of -4.845 psig. Since the increase in the magnitudeof negative containment pressure when going from three operable flow pathsto two is small, and is still within the -5 psig design value, the decreasein margin of safety resulting from this change is not considered to besignificant. Similarly, relative to the diaphragm slab design differentialpressure of 20 psid, the increase in the peak differential pressure from4.26 psid to 5.77 psid when going from the three flow path case to thetwo flow path case is not considered to be significant. Therefore, theproposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin ofsafety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and agrees with it. Therefore,we conclude that the amendment satisfies the three criteria listed in 10CFR 50.92(c). Based on that conclusion, the staff proposes to determinethat the proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Pottstown Public Library,500 High Street, Pottstown, Pennsylvania 19464. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Conner and Wetterhahn, 1747 PennsylvaniaAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20006 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Walter R.

The proposed changes can be divided into four categories- general, addition of valves, addition of isolation signals, and changesto the valve closure times. The first category, General, includes such proposed changes as changingthe title of the table to ``Primary Containment Isolation Valves;'' rearrangingthe table entries by penetration number; deleting the columns showing thevalve type, power, group, and location; adding the valve numbers; renamingsome columns to more accurately reflect the information they present; changingthe isolation signal RM (Remote Manual) to R (Remote); deleting Penetration36 since it is no longer used; changing isolation signal D to ``Line break- main steam (high steam flow),'' signal E to ``Line break - main steam(tunnel high temperature),'' and signal G to ``Reactor vessel low-low-lowwater level or high drywell pressure;'' adding isolation signals H (containmenthigh radiation), M (low condenser vacuum), and X (reactor vessel low waterlevel or high drywell pressure when both shutdown cooling suction valvesare not fully closed and reactor pressure is below 75 psig); adding notes,clarifying remarks, and other editorial changes. The second category, Valves, would upgrade the table to reflect the as-builtcondition of the plant by adding sixty-two valves and related information.These valves were either a part of the original plant design but inadvertentlyomitted in the original TS or were added as a result of post-TMI modificationsin accordance with NUREG-0578 and NUREG-0737. The third category, Isolation Valve Signals, would upgrade the table byreflecting the isolation signals applicable to certain valves which arepart of the existing plant design, but either were omitted from the initialissuance of the TS or were added as a post-TMI modification. The fourth category, Valve Closure Times, would reflect the changes madeto the stroke times for the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling and the HighPressure Coolant Injection steam line isolation valves to meet the requirementsof the environmental qualification program. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92.

Valves that have been addedto the table which have always been part of the FitzPatrick's originaldesign were reviewed by the NRC in the original Final Safety Analysis Report(FSAR) submittal. These valves have always been tested and treated as containmentisolation valves. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Changes related to the second category, Valves: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) will not significantly increase the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated because the added containment isolationvalves will improve each system's capability to reliably isolate in theevent of a postulated accident, thereby increasing the reliability of containmentintegrity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The vent and purge system is an essential system and is not used inthe beginning of a design bases Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). The systemis normally isolated and remains isolated until the operator has determinedthe need for its use. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Design features of the containment isolation valves, such as redundantflow-paths, will assure that the vent and purge system can perform bothits containment isolation function and post-accident function assumingany postulated single-failure. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The logic for operation of the vent and purge bypass valves is fail-safe.This logic is powered from both AC and DC sources such that no single-failurecan prevent purging or cause loss of containment integrity from eitherthe drywell or the torus.

These changeswould reflect the Recirculation System loop selection logic modificationinstalled during the Reload 1/Cycle 2 refueling outage. This proposal waspublished in the Federal Register on July 26, 1989 (54 FR 31116). By letterdated July 18, 1989, the licensee has amended the May 31, 1989 submittalto further clarify Section 3.5.A. Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.5.A.3.a addresses the situationwhen one of the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) pumps is made or found to beinoperable, while LCO 3.5.A.3.b addresses the situation when one of theLPCI subsystems is made or found to be inoperable. (Both LCOs permit continuedplant operation for seven days.) Since the loss of any one of the fourRHR pumps would render the corresponding LPCI inoperable, both LCOs addressidentical situations. To eliminate this duplication, the licensee has proposed elimination ofLCO 3.5.A.3.a. As a result, LCO 3.5.A.3.b would be renumbered to become3.5.A.3.a and relocated to the previous page and LCO 3.5.A.3.c would become3.5.A.3.b. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particularfacility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By December 15, 1989, the licensee mayfile a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendmentto the subject facility operating license and any person whose interestmay be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a partyin the proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene.Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filedin accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic LicensingProceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petitionfor leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or anAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by theChairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on therequest and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above.

Each contention must consistof a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the basesof the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expertopinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intendsto rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must alsoprovide references to those specific sources and documents of which thepetitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establishthose facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient informationto show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a materialissue of law or fact.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment.
