Four investors, who disclosed their bid for the construction materials company last month, said they wouldn't pursue it &quot;under present circumstances.&quot; However, Richard S. Schiffrin, an attorney for the group, said &quot;I'm not saying we're never going to&quot; reopen the bid. He declined to elaborate.    The investment group holds 5% of Continental's stock. It said its offer of $26.50 a share, for an indicated value of $35.2 million, had been friendly and that Continental's board hadn't made any written response to the bid, but said it wasn't interested in selling.    On Monday, Continental's board said it dropped consideration of the group's offer because the investors showed no evidence of additional financing or experience operating a company.    Continental adjourned its annual meeting last week to allow its shareholders to consider a proposed anti-takeover amendment to the company's certificate of incorporation. The meeting is scheduled to resume today.    In composite American Stock Exchange Trading yesterday, Continental shares closed at $22.50, down 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
