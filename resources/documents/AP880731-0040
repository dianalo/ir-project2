That military budget will again be near the top of the agenda asDefense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci opens his third round of talkswith Yazov in Moscow on Monday.   Soviet defense officials in the past said their annual spendingwas about 20 billion rubles, or $33 billion, just over one-tenth ofthe Pentagon budget.   But analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagon saySoviet defense spending is close to that of the United States,accounting for 15 percent to 17 percent of the Soviet grossnational product.   And Yazov, during his two previous meetings with Carlucci, haspegged Soviet defense spending at about 16 percent of GNP, veryclose to the U.S. estimate.   ``We welcome that kind of truth now,'' a senior Pentagonofficial said on the eve of Carlucci's departure for Moscow.   ``But that new candor doesn't substitute for the fact that theystill don't present a detailed public, accurate accounting of whattheir military budget really is and what it goes for,'' said theU.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The United States, which has an economy estimated at double thatof the Soviet Union, spent 6.6 percent of GNP on defense in 1986,according to U.S. government statistics.   The Soviets say they don't know exactly what they are spendingon defense because their data does not account for weaponsresearch, development and production, which consume more than halfthe Pentagon budget. Nowhere are the Soviet numbers pulled together.   And in a country where the government owns all industry, theSoviet military pays artificially low prices for goods that in manycases are not even available to civilian factories, such as specialsteel alloys.   ``It is kind of hard for us to believe that they don't know howmuch in detail they spend on military matters, but maybe it'strue,'' said the senior Pentagon official.   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called for reformsthroughout society, including the military, and wants the DefenseMinistry to produce a complete and reliable budget. Ultimately, hewants to improve the international climate enough to allow him todivert resources into the civilian sector.   Vadim Kuznetsov, deputy director of the U.S.A. desk at theSoviet Foreign Ministry, said in a recent interview in Moscow thathis nation would make good on its pledge to publish a detaileddefense budget by the early 1990s.   ``In two, three or four years, we will have much more correctfigures on military spending,'' said Kuznetsov. That will take anew system of accounting, similar to the one in which civilianfactories must pay their way or shut down, rather than exist onstate subsidies, as has been the case.   ``Under the old system, a truck could cost many times less forthe military than for a collective farm'' because of pricemanipulation, said Kuznetsov.   ``When we have price reform, the new price will reflect theproduction costs for everybody,'' he said. ``When a truck costs asmuch for a collective farm as it does for the military, then wewill have more accurate figures on military spending.''   But Soviet military spending will stay below that of America,said Kuznetsov, ``because we have compulsive military service. Wepractically pay our soldiers nothing. They get some pocket moneyfor cigarettes, that's all.''   In the United States, which since 1972 has had an all-volunteermilitary, military salaries make up $78.3 billion of the annualPentagon budget of $289.3 billion, according to Defense Departmentstatistics.   The new Soviet accounting method will bolster Gorbachev's policyof ``glasnost,'' or greater openness in discussing previously taboosubjects.   ``At public lectures, people would ask how with so few rubles inthe budget, we could have military parity with the United States,which spends $300 billion,'' said Kuznetsov.   The financial affairs of the Soviet Defense Ministry always havebeen secret, reviewed only by a handful of top Kremlin leaders.   Now, however, Gorbachev and his allies are calling for greaterpowers for the national parliament, the Supreme Soviet. AndKuznetsov says the day is not too distant when the Soviet defenseminister will be summoned before a legislative committee and askedto defend his budget in open session.   Even the revised accounting methods being discussed in theSoviet Union may not show the true cost of Soviet militaryspending, according to Andrew Marshall, head of the Pentagon'sOffice of Net Assessment.   Marshall, in an article printed by the congressional JointEconomic Committee last November, estimated that Soviet militaryspending may account for between 20 and 30 percent of GNP.   To reach that total, Marshall added:   _Traditionally military spending, including personnel, weapons,research and development, and the military side of the spaceprogram;   _Additional costs, such as civil defense and scarce resourcesdiverted from civilian industry;   _And ``the cost of external empire, costs that are undertakenfor the purposes of increasing protection of the Soviet Unionand@or for the expansion of its influence in the world.''   Even under glasnost, Soviet officials are only beginning todiscuss the pricklier aspects of their military spending.</TEXT></DOC>
