Talks toward the possible purchase of part or all of Unocal's Lemont, Ill., refinery, near Chicago, have been taking place both in Los Angeles and Houston, said a trade source familiar with the discussions.    The South American oil producer, a leading member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, also became part of the oil industry's biggest auction ever by submitting a bid to buy Tenneco's Chalmette, La., refinery, according to trade sources. Tenneco put the refinery on the market along with its other oil assets as part of a restructuring plan.    It isn't clear whether Venezuela would pursue the Unocal acquisition if its bid for the Tenneco refinery succeeded. There were indications late last week that some snags had arisen over the purchase price in the talks with Unocal of Los Angeles.    But Venezuela, which already owns extensive refining and marketing assets in the U.S., has made no secret of its interest in buying more. And Venezuela is a country in a hurry. Its oil industry officials are racing to complete any foreign acquisitions or joint-venture announcements before a presidential election in December, which could stall Venezuela's overseas investment.    And in a world currently awash in crude oil, Venezuela is up against stiff competition from other overseas producers -- including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Nigeria -- which also are looking to purchase direct refining-and-marketing outlets for their crude.    Regardless of the outcome of the Unocal talks, they signal Unocal's readiness to put part or all of its Midwestern refining and marketing system on the selling block. In the Midwest, Amoco Corp. and Shell Oil Co., among the nation's leading gasoline marketers, are strong players. Most major oil companies in recent years have begun withdrawing from markets where they don't have a dominant position.    The talks also highlight the aggressive stance in redefining the company that may be taken by Richard Stegemeier, who took over the top job in August from long-reigning chief executive officer Fred Hartley. Mr. Hartley had balked at selling any major assets to pay down the company's huge debt.    Built in 1971, the facility near Chicago is Unocal's newest refinery. A Unocal spokesman, who would neither confirm nor deny the existence of negotiations with Venezuela, said the Chicago-area facility provides gasoline to independent distributors as well as to company-owned retail outlets in the Midwest. The refinery, which can process 151,000 barrels of crude oil a day, was refurbished after an explosion four years ago. A new alkylation unit that helps produce high-octane gasoline currently in great demand by consumers, was installed as a result.    The Illinois plant is the only one of Unocal's five refineries producing gasoline and heating oil east of the Rocky Mountains. It is supplied with crude from pipelines running to the Chicago area from the Gulf of Mexico, making it easily accessible to overseas producers -- such as Venezuela.    Tenneco's Chalmette refinery is roughly the same size as the Unocal facility. It too has been significantly upgraded in recent years, although oil-industry officials say that any new owner of the refinery will face heavy capital expenditures in completing the improvements. Near New Orleans, the Tenneco facility also could be easily supplied with crude oil from Venezuela. </TEXT></DOC>
