 It's anapt expression whether applied to a bride's big day or to the softwareenvironments stitched together for reduced instruction set computing (RISC)architectures.andM;Unlike the startups that first introduced the high-performance RISCarchitectures, an older generation of vendors is turning to the fasttechnology for an infusion of processing power.andP;  RISC architectures are newlyarrived or coming soon from oldline players including Concurrent ComputerCorp., Data General Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., and Prime Computer Inc.andM;For these companies, mixing RISC with existing Unix environments is not amatter of tradition.andP;  With significant customer investments in Unixapplications, these companies are combining existing Unix OSs and, in somecases, applications to smooth the entry of their RISC systems to customersites.andM;&quot;If we do our job right, there ought not to be any real [architectural]issues,&quot; says Michael Harries, director of product planning at Prime, one ofmany companies mapping a common software environment to mitigate hardwaredifferences.andM;Common language compilers, data management and applications development toolsspanning RISC and complex instruction set computing (CISC) devices canobscure the underlying architectural differences among Prime's expandingcomputer families, Harries says.andP;  &quot;By having a consistent set of language anddevelopment tools, we are hiding the architectures from the end user.&quot;andM;Prime's cross-architecture applications hope chest includes a commondatabase--the Oracle DBMS--and remote file and procedural call code such asNetwork File System and Network Computing System.andP;  Prime further expects tobind its Unix development environments with a consistent set of Ada, C,FORTRAN, and Pascal compilers.andP;  Along with common network protocols, thesedevelopment tools will, in the coming year, bind Prime's RISC workstations,CISC 50 Series minicomputers, or EXL multiuser micros, says Harries.andM;Others similarly looking to bridge the old and new typically will retaintheir existing Unix OSs and add common graphical interfaces and developmenttools to boot.andP;  DEC and Data General have ported Unix-derived OSs and windowmanagement systems to newer RISC lines.andM;To smooth the differences in its computer architectures, DEC last yearestablished technical centers to train software developers in applicationsprogramming interfaces including its DECwindows user interface, CompoundDocument Architecture, and SQL Services.andP;  It is also making a softwareconversion manual available to developers.andM;With all of these commonalities, moving existing applications from old to newarchitectures should be easy.andP;  In fact, many vendors are proclaiming&quot;source-level&quot; compatibility via consistent Unix OS implementations.andP;  Simplyrecompile an application, and it's ready to go.andP;  Compared with transitionsfrom 16-bit CISC architectures to 32-bit, these preparations mean the changeis less fraught with complications.andP;  Yet, it doesn't mean there are nohurdles.andM;A compiler that isn't optimized for RISC architectures can waste inherenthardware performance without significantly improving system throughput, saysHoward Wactlar, vice provost for research computing at Carnegie-MellonUniversity, Pittsburgh.andM;&quot;These machines are highly subject to the performance of compilers,&quot; Wactlarsays.andP;  &quot;If you're moving an application over [from a CISC architecture],performance can be very unpredictable.&quot; So far, most vendors implementingRISC architectures are providing compilers geared to the new architectures,according to Wactlar.andP;  Compiler efficiency is crucial when, as in RISCarchitectures, the ratio of instructions per cycle determines performance.andO;Poorly generated code serves to stretch out a job's completion, he says.andM;The issue of efficiency means that few vendors will carry over existingcompilers.andP;  For instance, Concurrent, Prime, DEC, and Tandem Computers Inc.andO;have licensed the language compilers developed by MIPS Computer Systems Inc.,andO;Sunnyvale, Calif., for RISC processors.andP;  The software enables the matching ofexisting compiler front ends to MIPS Computer Systems' back-end binary codegenerator.andM;&quot;Potentially, you give up compatibility [by using a new compiler],&quot; saysDennis J. Tinley, Concurrent's assistant director of product management andplanning.andP;  &quot;However, we believe we'll be able to match most of the languages.andO;We're looking at moving our compiler front ends and marrying them to [theMIPS Computer Systems] back ends.&quot;andM;According to Tinley, intermediate languages binding compiler front and backends may not be appropriate in all cases.andP;  In DEC's case, the company istelling developers that some changes will be required for certain languages.andO;The company's Ultrix implementation of VAX C was tied closely to VMScompatibility, not RISC performance.andP;  Ultrix applications developed usingPortable C will run without modification.andM;Larry Weber, vice president of software at MIPS Computer Systems, says thatabout 25% of FORTRAN applications will experience problems when changing tothe new generation of optimizing compilers.andP;  Poorly written programs make upthe bulk of problems.andP;  FORTRAN programs experience a high degree of problemsstemming from &quot;misaligned&quot; data improperly coded in two-byte memory blocks,he says.andP;  His company provides compiler instructions that enable developersto deal with such programs.andM;These compiler options aren't without a performance penalty, however.andO;Applications using such options can suffer up to 15% performance losses,Weber notes.andM;Language changes may not be the only problem DEC users face.andP;  The company'sunique floating point data types present a larger problem for users withsizable engineering databases.andP;  Since DEC's new RISC workstation implementsthe IEEE floating point standard, it cannot read binary files created on aDEC VAX computer.andP;  The data must therefore be reformatted to make itaccessible to these systems.andM;Does all of this add up to a migration problem for existing applications?andO;Randy Levine, product marketing and planning manager for DEC's LaboratoryData Products group, claims that it doesn't.andP;  Interviewed prior to the RISCworkstation release, Levine said, &quot;For someone looking at the prospect ofbuying a high-performance workstation, there are three concerns: 'Is it ofhigh enough performance to make a difference?andP;  Can I buy it from someone Itrust?andP;  How well will it fit in with the rest of my computing environment?'andO;In all of our future offerings, Digital will address those kinds ofconcerns.&quot;andM;Similarly, the extent to which Prime can achieve a common set of languages,databases, and development tools derives from a lack of Unix support on its50 Series family in the past.andP;  While pledging a common environment acrossthree of its computer architectures, Prime does not plan to host this commonenvironment on the low-end Unix workstations it supplies for computer-aideddesign, says Harries.andM;Elsewhere, the software environments constructed around new RISC familiesstrive more for compatibility among vendors of the RISC architectures thandid past applications.andP;  For instance, Data General's goal is conformity withlanguages selected by the 88open Consortium, a vendors' group formed topromote the Motorola 88000 RISC architecture, says Ward D. MacKenzie, vp ofcorporate marketing at DG.&quot;andM;At press time, 88open hadn't released compilers of its own design.andP;  Aspokesman did not return calls inquiring about its compiler decision.andM;Notwithstanding Data General's commitment to compiler compatibility withother 88open systems, it is unclear how compatible its own RISC systems willbe with its Eclipse/MV line.andP;  It is carrying over its DG/UX OS and EthernetTCP/IP network support to upcoming RISC products, but the compilers and datamanagement tools from Eclipse/MV aren't necessarily following.andP;  &quot;There areareas we will choose to have compatibility at the common source level,&quot; saysMacKenzie.andP;  &quot;They just aren't public at this point.&quot;andM;Anthony Goschalk, marketing director at software developer Applix Inc.,andO;Westboro, Mass., which offers its office automation software on four RISCarchitectures, says that the degree to which applications exploit machinedependencies can make all the difference between easy and difficultmigration.andP;  &quot;The people who stuck with portable C will be in good shape onjust about all of these RISC machines,&quot; says Goschalk.andM;Like Wactlar, Goschalk minimizes the amount of rewriting involved in thetransition to new compilers, but not the degree of difficulty.andP;  &quot;The user whowrites code using every feature of a C compiler may find it less portable asthe front ends change.andP;  .  .  .  [But] it's still no more than 5%,&quot; he says.andM;&quot;Going from 16-bit to 32-bit was a huge transition.andP;  Going from 32-bit toRISC architectures is a much simpler transition,&quot; adds Goschalk.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
