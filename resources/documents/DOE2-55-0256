Thesecells suppressed the production of anti-DNA by both autologous peripheralblood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and allogeneic PBMC derived from systemiclupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Anti-DNA production was suppressedsignificantly more than anti-RNA, antitetanus, or total immunoglobulinproduction. Specific suppression was enhanced by increasing the numbersof DNA-primed CD8+ cells and was obliterated by irradiation of the DNA-primedcells. In contrast to T cells from normal individuals, T cells obtainedfrom two intensively studied SLE patients were unable to generate specificsuppressor cells for anti-DNA production in both autologous and allogeneictest systems. Despite this defect, these patients were still capableof generating specific suppressor cells for antibody production directedagainst an exogenous antigen, tetanus toxoid.</TEXT></DOC>
