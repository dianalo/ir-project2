The United States _ for many years the bankers' No. 1 darling _remains stuck in fourth place. And in general the world's bankersseem to be taking a gloomier view of the world debt situation.   In a survey of 112 nations, Institutional Investor, an Americanfinancial magazine, finds that the average country's credit ratingin March has dropped considerably from a similar survey lastSeptember.   Every six months the New York-based monthly asks about 100international banks to rate the creditworthiness of more than 100nations on a scale of 0 to 100. In the magazine's March surveyJapan ranks first with a score of 94.6, and North Korea 112th with4.0.   The global average rating was 38.9, down 0.4 points from lastSeptember, and down 1.1 points from March 1987. InstitutionalInvestor notes that this is the fourth consecutive drop from thepeak of 40.6 attained in March 1986.   Countries with higher credit ratings generally find it easier toborrow from international commercial banks and are likely to obtainmore favorable credit terms.   ``The most stable region in recent surveys has been WesternEurope,'' the magazine says, ``but this time it registered thebiggest gain of any region, rising 0.6 points to 73.9.''   One banker noted that a rising German mark may cause exportdifficulties for West Germany and it faces greater unemploymentdifficulties than Switzerland.   Portugal's rating rose 2.2 points, thanks largely to ``anausterity program... European Community entry, and...full-fledgedtransition to democracy.''   Despite Japan's pre-eminence, the Asia-Pacific region,comprising 19 countries ``led the decliners with a sizable 1.4point fall'' in the average country rating.   Australia fell 2.2 points, the second-largest drop in thesurvey, due mainly to ``continued balance of payments deficits...and the fact that its borrowing has now reached a very highpercentage of gross national product.''   The Middle East, comprising 14 nations, was up an average 0.4points ``largely because no news is good news for the region.   ``The biggest gainer was Cyprus, up 1.9 points, because of...consistent improvement in the current account.''   In Eastern Europe ``the big gainer was Rumania, up 2.2 pointsbecause of increased banker confidence that it would maintain itsrepayment schedule.''   ``Africa had more gainers than losers _ 14 nations to 11 _ yetits overall rating fell 0.3 points.''   ``The Congo fell 2.0 points, the third-biggest drop in thesurvey,'' probably due in large part to a lack of financialinformation on the country.   In North America the United States dropped 1.5 points, duemainly to the budget and foreign trade deficits and the decline ofthe dollar.   In Latin America ``Brazil fell 2.3 points, the biggest declinein the survey'' because of political uncertainties and the lack ofa coherent economic policy in the Third World's biggest debtornation.</TEXT></DOC>
