The regulationsare needed to implement the amendments to Part B of the Education of theHandicapped Act (Part B) that are included in the Education of the HandicappedAct Amendments of 1986 (1986 Amendments) and in the Handicapped ProgramsTechnical Amendments of 1988 (1988 Amendments). These final regulations:require that State plans include sections dealing with interagency agreementsand personnel standards; clarify the responsibility of educational andother agencies to provide special education and related services; add nonsupplantingrequirements at the State level; permit the State to use additional PartB set-aside funds for monitoring and complaint investigations; alter programrequirements for the Secretary of the Interior; and add technical amendmentsto the Part B procedures for waiving the supplement not supplant requirement,to the child count procedures, to the procedural safeguards, and to theformula for calculating State allocations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>The regulations take effect either 45 days afterpublication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>or later if the Congress takes certain adjournments,with the exception of andSection;andSection; 300.152, 300.153, and 300.260.Sections 300.152, 300.153, and 300.260 will become effective after theinformation collection requirements contained in those sections have beensubmitted by the Department of Education to and approved by the Officeof Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

The purposeof the Education of the Handicapped Act is stated as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is the purpose of this Act to assure that all handicapped childrenhave available to them, within the time periods specified in section 612(2)(B),a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special educationand related services designed to meet their unique needs, to assure thatthe rights of handicapped children and their parents or guardians are protected,to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all handicappedchildren, and to assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to educatehandicapped children. (20 U.S.C. 1400(c))</ITAG>The 1986 Amendments amended Part B of the Education of the HandicappedAct. These final regulations implement the changes made to Part B by the1986 Amendments. On March 14, 1988, the Secretary published a notice ofproposed rulemaking for this part in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, Vol. 53, No. 49 FR 8390. This notice of proposedrulemaking included a summary of the major issues in the proposed regulations.That summary addressed revisions to the Part B regulatory requirementsthat: (1) Revised supplanting requirements that require States to assurethat Part B funds will not be used to supplant State, local and Federalfunds (other than Part B funds); (2) added a new regulation for the developmentand implementation of interagency agreements; (3) added a new regulationstating that Part B funds shall not be construed to permit a State to reduceassistance or alter eligibility under programs supported by Federal Medicaidand Maternal and Child Health programs; (4) revised terms and conditionsof grants to the Secretary of the Interior; (5) added a new requirementallowing State educational agencies (SEAs) to use their Part B set-asidefunds to pay increased costs of State-level monitoring and complaint investigations;and (6) revised the child count requirements. The summary in the noticeof proposed rulemaking also included a discussion of a proposed additionto the comment following andSection; 300.552 that addressed the general requirementsfor educating preschool handicapped children in the least restrictive environmentand new requirements for establishing State personnel standards. The summaryappeared in the notice of proposed rulemaking on pages 8390 and 8391 aspublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 14, 1988.As a result of public comments, language is added to andSection; 300.153to clarify the personnel standards in States for individuals in a Statewho provide special education and related services under Part B. For themost part, the language in andSection; 300.153 duplicates the language inthe statute.This program will enhance the family life of the participants through parentalparticipation in each handicapped child's educational program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes</ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed rulemaking,832 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. In addition,as noted in the notice of proposed rulemaking, Part H of the Act containsa statutory provision for personnel standards that is virtually identicalto the statutory provision in this part. As was indicated in the noticeof proposed rulemaking for this part, the more than 1500 comments sentto the Department about the notice of proposed rulemaking for Part H ofthe Act that addressed the personnel standards provisions proposed forthe Part H program also were taken into consideration in drafting the noticeof proposed rulemaking and these final regulations for andSection;300.153.(<T3>See </T3>proposed 34 CFR 303 at 52 FR 44360, December 8, 1987.) Commentsreceived on the notice of proposed rulemaking for the Preschool Grantsfor Handicapped Children Program (52 FR 44346, November 18, 1987) regardingthe implementation of the least restrictive environment requirement forpreschool aged children covered by Part B also were considered in preparingthe final regulations. An analysis of these comments and a summary of substantivechanges in the regulations since publication of the notice of proposedrulemaking follows.Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations towhich they pertain. Minor changes made to the language published in thenotice of proposed rulemaking_and suggested changes the Secretary is notlegally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_arenot addressed.Section 300.150 State Level Nonsupplanting<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters argued that this section should bechanged to specify that the required assurance applies only to Federal,State, and local funds under the direct control of the State educationalagency. They argued that the requirement is not enforceable. Commentersstated that this section should be changed to require a description ofthe SEA's attempts to get non-educational agencies to pay for servicesrequired to meet the needs of handicapped children under this part. Somecommenters argued that the Department should exempt programs and projectsfunded under the Chapter 1 State Operated and Supported Programs for HandicappedChildren program from this requirement.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 300.150 of the final regulations uses thelanguage in the statute. The statute does not limit the applicability ofthis requirement to funds directly under the control of the State educationalagency. The statutory nonsupplanting requirement applies to all Part Bfunds that are distributed in accordance with the statutory formula (20U.S.C. 1411(d)) to local educational agencies or intermediate educationalunits. There is no provision for exempting Federal funds such as fundsprovided under the Chapter 1 State Operated and Supported Programs forHandicapped Children program from this requirement unless a waiver is grantedin accordance with andSection;300.589. This nonsupplanting provision doesnot apply to Part B funds that are not distributed to local educationalagencies or intermediate educational units pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 1411.<T3>Changes: </T3>New language is added to the comment following andSection;300.150to clarify that the State must assure that the requirements of this sectionare applied to all Part B funds that are distributed to local educationalagencies and intermediate educational units under 20 U.S.C. 1411(d).Section 300.152 Interagency Agreements<T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters felt that the Secretary should useonly the statutory language in this section of the regulation. They feltthat the requirement to have State educational agencies include in theirState plans a description of the role each agency plays in providing orpaying for special education and related service limits the flexibilityof State educational agencies to provide or pay for services to childrenwith handicaps because the State educational agency is committed to theprojected plan that they submit to the Department as part of the Stateplan. During the fiscal year, particular circumstances may occur that requirenovel procedures not covered in the plan. One commenter asked if interagencyagreements need to be part of the State plans. Other commenters statedthat the Secretary should add requirements for involving local educationalagencies in the development of interagency agreements and for timelinesfor reimbursements.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The 1986 Amendments added a new State plan requirementto section 613 of the Act concerning the development and implementationof interagency agreements on financial responsibility for providing freeappropriate public education for handicapped children. Because in the past,many States have experienced problems with coordination of responsibilityfor providing and paying for appropriate services for handicapped children,the Secretary believes that including a description in the State plan ofthe roles that agencies will play in providing and paying for appropriateservices is necessary to implement this new statutory requirement. In orderto develop these interagency agreements, the agencies involved will haveto identify and agree upon their respective roles and shared responsibilityto determine their reasonable proportional share of costs and to ensurethat the EHA-B requirements are met. Monitoring reviews of participatingStates continue to show problems in the provision of free appropriate publiceducation to children with handicaps because of the failure to make clearhow children who are the responsibility of more than one agency will beserved. The lack of clarity in allocation of fiscal responsibility amongsuch agencies has resulted in situations where some children do not receiveneeded service, parents are charged for services that are a public responsibility,or litigation ensues because of multiagency disputes over financial responsibilities.The requirement for States to include this information in the State planwill obligate States to resolve any areas of ambiguity in allocation ofresponsibility among the various agencies and provide information to parentsand the involved agencies about the availability of services and otherresources. Including the actual interagency agreements in State plans however,seems unduly burdensome. States can amend the descriptions in their Stateplans to reflect any changes that may occur during the State plan period.The Secretary believes States should decide whether to include local educationalagencies in the development of interagency agreements.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter asked the Secretary to require Statesto add a description of the procedures that educational agencies may useto secure reimbursement from agencies that are parties to an interagencyagreement to their State plans.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that the development of theseprocedures is a State responsibility.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter asked if the State educational agencymust develop agreements with local educational agencies.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The preamble to the notice of proposed rulemakingincluded a discussion of the meaning of the phrase ``other appropriateState and local agencies.'' The preamble to the notice of the proposedregulations stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Other appropriate agencies are all those State and local agenciesother than the SEA that provide or pay for special education or relatedservices for children with handicapping conditions. The regulations requirethe SEA to describe the role that each of those agencies will play in providingor paying for those services. As required by statute, the regulations alsorequire that SEA policies and procedures provide for the development andimplementation of interagency agreements that define the responsibilitiesof each agency and establish mechanisms for resolving interagency disputes.(<T4>Federal Register, </T4> Vol. 53, No. 49, 3/14/88, p. 8390).</ITAG>There is no requirement for SEAs to develop separate agreements with LEAsto satisfy this requirement.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Section 300.153 Personnel Standards</T3><T3>Comments:</T3> The majority of comments that the Department receivedin response to the notice of proposed rulemaking addressed this sectionof the proposed regulations. The following paragraphs summarize these comments,which are classified under the categories that follow. As noted in thepreamble, the Secretary also considered concerns raised by commenters aboutthe section dealing with personnel standards in the notice of proposedrulemaking for Part H of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="81">Appropriate Qualifications of Personnel</ITAG>Numerous commenters were concerned that hiring individuals who meet thelicensure requirements established for a profession or discipline, or thehighest State standard for a profession or discipline, would not assurethat these individuals would be appropriately trained to work in a schoolsetting. These commenters stated that:andbullet; Related service providers who meet the highest requirements inthe State may not have appropriate special education training or instructionalskills since these may not be required for licensure or certification.andbullet; The phrase ``highest standard'' should be changed to read ``higheststandard appropriate to an educational setting.''andbullet; Implementing the ``highest requirement'' standard would not achieveuniform standards across States, if this is the intent behind the statute.andbullet; Multiple levels of supervision exist in a school setting in orderto provide appropriate supervision for school personnel. Because such supervisionis not available outside of the schools, individuals in private practicemay require advanced degrees and additional training. A high level of competencecan be maintained in a school setting because of this formal supervision;thus, current certification standards are appropriate.andbullet; The unintended result of this requirement may be increased specializationwhich results in less ability to work with regular educators and studentsin the regular classroom environment.andbullet; Licensure can be used as a barrier to practice and interfere withprofessional growth.andbullet; The Secretary should recognize the differences in school psychologyand school social work as distinct from psychology and social work whenconsidering the highest requirements for training.andbullet; Requiring personnel to meet appropriate qualifications will notnecessarily enhance the quality of services available to handicapped children.<ITAG tagnum="81">Impact on Individuals Currently Working With Handicapped Children</ITAG>Numerous commenters felt that the personnel standards would place a burdenupon individuals who are currently providing special education and relatedservices to handicapped children. These commenters stated that:andbullet; There is no provision for grandfathering into the system personnelwho are certified under current State standards and are already employedby the State or by local educational agencies and other State agencies.The Supreme Court has declared that certification to practice a professionin a State is a property right under the U.S. Constitution that cannotbe abridged without due process.andbullet; State educational agencies should not have the authority to forceindividuals who hold SEA certification for a profession or discipline tomeet additional standards that exceed the current certification standards.andbullet; Individuals already certified could find it necessary to returnto school to qualify for licensure if a State imposed an additional licensurerequirement. This could be a financial burden for those individuals orfor local and State educational agencies.andbullet; States should include an analysis in the State plan of the currentState standards for, and status of personnel in, each profession or disciplinein the State and whether these personnel meet the highest standard to determinethe impact of these requirements on personnel currently employed in a State.<ITAG tagnum="81">Personnel Shortages</ITAG>Numerous commenters pointed out that there is already a shortage of qualifiedpersonnel to serve children with handicaps. These commenters stated that:andbullet; Increasing certification and licensure standards would intensifythis problem.andbullet; This requirement would divert candidates to clinical employmentinstead of positions in schools.andbullet; This requirement would adversely affect the ability to attractand secure staff in rural areas.<ITAG tagnum="81">Increased Burdens on States and School Districts</ITAG>A number of commenters stated that the requirement to have personnel meetthe highest requirements in the State for a profession or discipline wouldplace an added burden on local educational agencies and would preempt theState's authority. These commenters stated that:andbullet; The requirements would result in high education costs for thoseschool systems that pay for additional training for employees.andbullet; The personnel standards at andSection; 300.153 contradict the languageof the statute and andSection; 300.600 of the regulations, which states thatall programs funded under Part B must meet the education standards of theState educational agency.andbullet; This is an area in which the Federal government should not intervene.andbullet; The Department should be flexible in setting timelines; the needfor change in personnel standards will vary among States.<ITAG tagnum="81">Recommendations to Use Specific Language in the Final Regulations</ITAG>Numerous commenters suggested changing the language that appeared in thenotice of proposed rulemaking for this section. These commenters made thefollowing suggestions:andbullet; The wording in andSection; 300.153 is vague and subject to variousinterpretations (e.g., ``appropriately'' and ``adequately'' describe standardsthat are distinguishable from ``the highest standard'').andbullet; Use the same language for personnel standards that the Secretaryused in the notice of proposed rulemaking for Part H of the Act.andbullet; The regulations should provide guidance for what the ``highestrequirements'' should be in a State.andbullet; Add the following language if a State employs individuals whodo not meet State standards: ``(1) The steps the State is taking to requirethe hiring of personnel that meet standards as determined by the State,and (2) the steps the State is taking to require individuals providingspecial education and related services who do not meet these standardsto meet them.''andbullet; Include language to assure that States are taking timely stepsto require the retraining or training of personnel that meet appropriateprofessional requirements and improve their personnel standards by addingthe following language at the end of andSection; 300.153(2)(b): ``* * * andtimelines for accomplishing those steps.''andbullet; Define terms such as ``profession,'' ``discipline,'' and ``highestrequirement.''andbullet; Add additional guidelines on how to determine the level of competencywithin professions.andbullet; Add language to the regulations requiring States to include thetimelines in the State plan for retraining or hiring personnel who meetthe highest requirement in the State.<ITAG tagnum="81">Support for the Language in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>Numerous commenters supported andSection; 300.153 as it appeared in the noticeof proposed rulemaking. These commenters stated that:andbullet; The proposed regulations would assure that handicapped childrenreceive special education and related services from personnel who havebeen trained according to the standards adopted by a profession regardlessof the setting in which services are provided.andbullet; Individuals who do not meet the highest standards for a professionare not qualified to provide special education and related services requiredunder this part.<T3>Discussion: </T3>There are two issues States must address in meetingthe requirements under section 613(a)(4) of the Act and andSection; 300.153:first, the substantial number of special education personnel who have beenissued temporary or emergency teaching certificates; and second, discrepanciesbetween the State's certification standards for personnel providing specialeducation and related services under Part B and the standards for individualsproviding similar services in other agencies.With respect to determining the highest standard for personnel who providespecial education and related services, the Secretary agrees with the numerouscommenters who stated that the standards required under this part mustbe based on the highest standards in the State for personnel providingsimilar services to children and youth with handicaps. Each State mustdetermine the range of occupational categories that are needed for thedelivery of services under Part B to children and youth with handicaps.When identifying the highest requirements in the State for each occupationalcategory, the State educational agency must look at the standards appropriatefor the responsibilities of and the supervisory controls for personnelproviding special education and related services under this part. Thesestandards may be different from those that are appropriate for personnelin other agencies. The Secretary notes, for example, that school psychologistsare members of a specific occupational category who have training requirementsappropriate for their responsibilities under Part B.The legislative history for the Act states that: <ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee is concerned about the increasing number of personnelproviding special education and related services who do not meet the highestState standards established for employment in a specific profession ordiscipline. For example, many teachers providing special education havebeen issued temporary teaching certification and do not meet full certificationstandards related to the area in which they provide instruction. The Committeeintends that the States will take steps to ensure that all special educationteachers are fully qualified and certified for the areas in which theyare providing instruction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee also is concerned that some States have establishededucation and training requirements for individuals providing servicesthat do not apply to all members of that profession employed by State andlocal educational agencies. For example, 19 States currently require aspeech-language pathologist to have a master's degree to legally provideservices to handicapped infants, children, and youth in a nonpublic agency.However, in these same States, the State educational agency allows individualswith less than a master's degree to provide services to handicapped infants,children, and youth in the schools. The Committee hopes that States willtake steps to ensure that professionals providing special education andrelated services meet appropriate professional requirements in the Stateto practice a specific profession or discipline.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">H.R. Rep. No. 860, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 38-39 (1986) The intent of the 1988 Amendments is to ensure that only fully qualifiedpersonnel provide services to handicapped children in schools.The Act requires State educational agencies to establish and maintain appropriatestandards for those personnel providing special education and related servicesand to ensure that personnel meet these standards. It also requires thatStates must include in their State plans the steps that they are takingto require the retraining of personnel who do not meet these standardsor the hiring of personnel who meet appropriate requirements. The Secretarybelieves that these steps must be reached within a reasonable time periodto be established by the State. In addition, the Secretary has determined that the information that theState collects and uses to ascertain the status of personnel standardsin the State (<T3>see </T3>andSection;300.153(d)) must be made available to the public.This requirement conforms to the rule in 34 CFR 76.106(a) that requiresStates to make available for public inspection ``[a]ll State plans andrelated official materials.'' <T3>Changes:</T3> Section 300.153 has been amended to add definitions of``appropriate professional requirements in the State,'' ``highest requirementsin the State applicable to a specific profession or discipline,'' ``professionor discipline,'' and ``State approved or recognized certification, licensing,registration, or other comparable requirements.''Section 300.153(c)(1) (proposed andSection;300.153(b)) has been changed tomake it clear that standards for temporary or emergency certification areamong the personnel standards subject to the requirements of this part.This provision also requires that State plans must include procedures fornotifying agencies and personnel of the steps that the State is takingand the timelines that it has established for the retraining or hiringof personnel to meet appropriate professional requirements in the State.The Secretary appreciates that these requirements regarding personnel standardsmay require retraining or additional training of some individuals currentlyemployed by school systems. Any new personnel standards established bythe State would, of course, be implemented in a manner consistent withthe legal rights of individual employees to continued employment and dueprocess. In order to monitor the progress of each State in complying withthe requirements regarding personnel standards, the Secretary requiresStates to establish timelines for implementation of these requirementsand to describe procedures for giving notice of the changed requirements,including those timelines, in their State Plans.Language has been added to andSection;300.153(e) to make it consistent withthe definitions of ``profession or discipline'' and ``State approved orrecognized certification, licensing, registration, or other comparablerequirements'' in andSection;300.153(a) (3)-(4). The comment following andSection;300.153 is revised to clarify that eachState uses its own existing highest requirements to determine which personnelstandards are appropriate for retraining or hiring staff who provide specialeducation and related services to children and youth with handicaps. EachState determines which occupational categories are required to serve handicappedchildren under Part B. A provision has been added to andSection;300.153(d)to require that the State make available to the public the informationit collects and uses to ascertain the status of personnel standards. It is important for the Secretary and the public to be able, upon request,to inspect the information used in establishing personnel standards underthis part. The State need not, however, append this material to the StatePlan submitted to the Department.Section 300.370 Use of State Allocations<T3>Comments:</T3> Some commenters noted that this section provided sufficientflexibility to allow States to make the administrative arrangements neededto monitor this program. One commenter wanted to add language stating thatState educational agencies may employ personnel or contract with intermediateeducational units to carry out their monitoring activities. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The section, which incorporates statutory language,permits States to use the funds available under this part to employ personnelor contract with intermediate educational units for the administrationof monitoring activities. <T3>Changes:</T3> None.Section 300.552 Placements <T3>Comments:</T3> A number of commenters felt that the requirements regardingplacement in the least restrictive environment should apply to preschoolchildren.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The requirements in this part apply to all childrenaged three through 21 who are eligible for services under this part orwho are participating in a program, such as the Chapter 1 the State Operatedor Supported Programs for Handicapped Children program, that incorporatesthe requirements of this part.<T3>Changes: </T3>Language is added to the comment following this sectionto emphasize that the requirement to serve children in the least restrictiveenvironment applies to all preschool children aged three through five withhandicaps.<T3>Comments: </T3>Some commenters wanted clarification of the definitionof ``least restrictive environment'' for preschool children. These commenterswere especially interested in satisfying the least restrictive environmentrequirements in States that do not provide preschool programs for non-handicappedchildren. Several commenters felt that a placement decision must be basedupon a child's individualized education program. These commenters saidthat the appropriate placement for a particular child may not be an integratedsetting. Other comments pointed out that alternative delivery models, includinghome-based or center-based programs, should be available for meeting theneeds of preschoolers with handicaps. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The existing requirements about placements in theleast restrictive environment (andSection;andSection; 300.550-300.556) applyto all children participating in the Part B program. The Secretary notesthat the appropriate setting for a particular child may not be an integratedsetting. There are a variety of placements that can meet the needs of preschoolchildren with handicaps. The determination about the placement of a particularchild must be based upon that child's individualized education program.<T3>Changes: </T3>Language has been added to the comment following andSection;300.552: (1) To emphasize that the requirement to serve children in theleast restrictive environment, to the maximum extent appropriate, appliesto preschool children and (2) to provide examples of alternative methodsof meeting this requirement in States that do not provide preschool programsfor non-handicapped children. <T3>Comment: </T3>Some commenters wanted to revise the language in theseregulations to emphasize the importance of involving family members toassist in their child's development. They stated, for example, that familymembers should be trained to provide services for their preschool child.<T3>Discussion: </T3>``Parent counseling and training'' is defined at 34CFR 300.13(b)(6) as a related service and can be included in an individualizededucation program if it is determined to be needed to assist a child inbenefitting from special education. The regulations implementing Part Balso emphasize the role of parents at the meeting held to develop a child'sindividualized education program. <T3>See </T3>Question 26 in Appendix C to 34 CFR Part 300. Finally, theregulations at 34 CFR 300.370(b)(2) include ``parent training activities''under the definition of ``support services'' for which a State educationalagency (SEA) may use its Part B allocation. The Secretary has consistently supported parental involvement in all educationalprograms. This includes supporting the important role of parents as activeparticipants in the development and implementation of their child's educationalprogram. States are encouraged to increase efforts to include parents indeveloping and providing special education and related services to theirpreschool child with handicaps.<T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter stated that locating classes for preschoolchildren with handicaps in regular elementary schools should not be consideredan alternative that promotes the integration of handicapped and non-handicappedchildren.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The continuum of alternative placements describedat andSection; 300.551 includes a variety of placements. The statement addedto the comment following andSection; 300.552 is consistent with requirementsin andSection; 300.551.<T3>Changes:</T3> None. Section 300.702 <T3>Limitations and Exclusions </T3><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters objected to the 12 percent cap onthe number of children whom the Secretary may count for the purpose ofgenerating program funds. Other commenters asked the Secretary to add moredetailed requirements to this section, for example, to elaborate upon therequirement at andSection; 300.702(b) regarding the availability of funds.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The requirement establishing the 12 percent cap isstatutory. It applies to the number of children who may be counted forthe purposes of generating program funds and does not put any limitationson the number of children who can be served under this part. The only languagethat is added to the existing language in this section is statutory languagethat was added to reflect changes made by the 1986 Amendments. The Secretarydoes not feel that more extensive changes should be made to this sectionat this time. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Amendments Added by the 1986 Amendments </ITAG>Technical amendments have been added in these final regulations that werenot published as part of the notice of proposed rulemaking. Amendmentsare added to andSection; 300.589(a), which deals with the EHA-B supplementand not supplant waiver procedure, and to the comments following andSection;300.750 and andSection; 300.751. Sections 300.750 and 300.751 describe therequirements State educational agencies must use for submitting child countdata to the Secretary. These changes add the statutory changes made bythe 1986 Amendments. <ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Changes Resulting From the 1988 Amendments</ITAG>Technical amendments are added in the final regulations to reflect amendmentsmade to Part B by the 1988 Amendments. The reference to the State Operatedor Supported Programs for Handicapped Children Program is changed so thatthe title reads ``subpart 2 of part D of Chapter 1 of title 1 of the Elementaryand Secondary Education Act of 1965 and section 202(1) of the Carl PerkinsVocational Education Act'' in andSection; 300.138 and andSection; 300.753(b)(3).Section 300.300(3)(b) is amended to state that the provision does not applyto children aged three through five in any fiscal year for which the Statereceives a grant under section 619(a)(1) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Waiver of Rulemaking</ITAG>In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Provision Act (20U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553,it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunityto comment on proposed regulations. However, since the technical changesadded to these regulations merely incorporate statutory changes into existingregulations and do not themselves establish new substantive policy, publiccomment could have no effect on the content of these amendments. Therefore,the Secretary has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) that proposed rulemakingon these amendments is unnecessary and contrary to public interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291.
