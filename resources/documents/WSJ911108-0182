The utility added that as part of its environmentalefforts, it will seek to mitigate greenhouse gases associatedwith suspected global warming, a step that may signal thebeginning of a trend in the utility industry. In May, twoCalifornia utilities -- Southern California Edison Co. andthe Los Angeles Department of Power andamp; Water -- pledged totrim their greenhouse gas emissions 20% over 20 years.</LP><TEXT>   Utilities are emerging as leaders in responding to thegreenhouse threat to reduce their exposure to potentialfuture costs, said Ralph Cavanagh, an energy specialist withthe Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmentalgroup. If global warming from emissions of carbon dioxide andother gases is convincingly established, legislators arelikely to enact &quot;carbon taxes&quot; on such emissions. Such taxescould hit utilities especially hard, Mr. Cavanaugh said.Electric utilities account for about one-third of thenation's carbon dioxide emissions.   New England Electric said it aims to cut its air pollutionemissions under a long-term plan that includes use of lesspolluting power sources, promotion of energy conservation andmeasures to offset greenhouse emissions. The company addedthat it plans to seek permission from regulators to recovercosts of the plan from customers. But its overall program isdesigned to keep rate increases &quot;at or below inflation forthe balance of the decade,&quot; the utility said.   &quot;We think we can bring about a great deal of environmentalimprovement at a modest price,&quot; said John W. Rowe, theutility's president and chief executive officer. He addedthat under the program, the utility is &quot;thinking of spendingup to $20 million a year&quot; on &quot;renewable&quot; generating sources,such as waste-to-energy plants and wind and solar power, andon pollution-offsetting measures.   However, most of the air pollution gains anticipated underthe program will be achieved by greater reliance onrelatively clean-burning natural gas and by utility-sponsoredprograms to increase customers' energy efficiency, Mr. Rowesaid. New England Electric, considered a utility pioneer inpromoting efficiency, now spends about $100 million annuallyto foster energy conservation by its customers.   The utility said its power generating unit plans tosolicit proposals from outsiders for offsetting greenhouseemissions. The unit also plans to test the feasibility andpublic acceptance of offsetting strategies, such as plantingtrees, enhancing marine algal growth to absorb carbon dioxideand recycling chlorofluorocarbons -- greenhouse gases used inrefrigerators and air conditioners.   The utility said it has formed an &quot;environmentalcollaborative&quot; to work with the Conservation Law Foundation,an environmental group in Boston, Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology and other outside advisers to develop plans tolower the environmental costs of power generation.</TEXT></DOC>
