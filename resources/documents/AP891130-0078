At 8 a.m. EST, Tropical Storm Karen, with 50 mph winds, wasabout 125 miles south-southwest of Havana and was not expected tostrengthen, said the National Hurricane Center in suburban CoralGables. It was drifttng toward Cuba at about 5 mph.   Depressions become named storms when their sustained winds reach39 mph; hurricanes have winds of at least 74 mph. Karen is the 11thnamed storm of the season, which began June 1.   The six-month season was far less deadly than 1988's, in which550 people died in storms.   This year's storms killed 84 people, including 56 in the UnitedStates, said meteorologist Mark Zimmer. Hurricane Hugo was blamedfor 49 deaths, including 21 in this country. It slammed into SouthCarolina on Sept. 21.   ``I've seen greater damage in smaller areas,'' said Bob Sheets,director of the hurricane center. ``But I've never seen it on sucha large scale where you go mile after mile with such massivedamage.''   Overall damage from Hugo totaled about $10 billion. In theUnited States, it caused a record storm damage of about $7 billion.Most of the U.S. damage was around Charleston.   The U.S. Virgin Islands are racing to recover from Hugo in timefor the tourist season.   ``We are still in a sense reeling from the effects of Hugo butthat didn't dampen our spirit,'' said Alexander A. Ferrelly,governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. He said Wednesday that St.Thomas and St. John are ready for winter tourists and St. Croixwould be ready by early 1990.   It was the most expensive disaster for the American Red Crosssince the organization began 110 years ago. Latest figures show theagency has spent about $38 million in the Caribbean and theCarolinas, said Michael Caudill, a spokesman in Washington.   The hurricane season, which began June 1, had four tropicalstorms, counting Karen, and seven hurricanes. The storms also werestronger than usual, said Sheets.   Last year, there were seven tropical storms and five hurricanes.The Atlantic season usually has 10 named storms. Normally, onlyfive or six whip up the 74-mph sustained winds to become ahurricane.   Hugo, the fifth major Atlantic hurricane in the last decade toreach U.S. shores, may have marked the end of a 30-year period offewer, weaker hurricanes, Sheets said.   ``There have been fewer of the stronger hurricanes makinglandfall since the 1960s,'' Sheets said. ``Now maybe we're startingto return to more normal activity like we had in the '50s and'60s.''   During the 1950s, eight major hurricanes hit the United States,while seven struck the following decade.   After Hugo, the most damaging tropical system this year wasTropical Storm Allison. It dumped large amounts of rain and caused11 deaths and $500 million damage in Texas and Louisiana.</TEXT></DOC>
