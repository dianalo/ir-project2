Thousands of other sick children today are at homealone or at day care or at school because their mothers had to hump it in aculture that has forsaken caring.;    These mothers, meanwhile, are quietlycultivating little gardens of desperation and spiritual despair.;    What theyneed is anger, according to a new book called &quot;Prisoners of Men's Dreams&quot; bySuzanne Gordon (Little, Brown, $19.95).;    The kind of anger that recognizesinjustice, that motivates change, that says: We're not going to take itanymore.;    &quot;Where has women's anger gone?&quot; asks Helena Walzer, mother of a9-month-old baby and one of several women interviewed in Gordon's book. &quot;Whathas happened to us, to me?&quot;;    Walzer is a former investment consultant whodecided to stay home when she became pregnant. She, too, is one of the luckyones. She had the option of staying home with her young one. She has theoption of going back to work in good time, at a good wage, at a reasonablepace.;    But something is still missing in Walzer's life that compels her toquestion the loss of anger. The anger that once mobilized women to changetheir lives.;    Today, women's lives are, indeed, changed. But not in waysthat are constructive to women, their families or their communities. Absent isa sense of community caring that allows -- even encourages -- both men andwomen to be responsive to home as well as to work.;    &quot;We don't know how tobe angry about things anymore,&quot; says Walzer. &quot;It shocks me that we're not allin rebellion.;    &quot;It's as though we've gone back in time to the early '60s,except that now it's the lucky ones who get to stay home with their childrenand the unlucky ones who have to cope with work and family.&quot;;    I think Iknow where all the anger has gone -- to exhaustion.;    Women are so worn out,they're too tired to protest. When there's dinner to cook, homework to direct,laundry to fold and next day's lunch boxes to pack -- all this after a fullday's work -- it's tough to be reflective, tough to muster anger.;    What isneeded, say both Walzer and Gordon, is a new culture of caring.;    &quot;Care islife,&quot; says Gordon, &quot;It is through caring, connection and community -- not inspite of it -- that we achieve and create. Care is an integral part of ourworld, but in our society we have diminished and subverted it.&quot;;    Gordonwants to resurrect caring though a National Care Agenda, which she describesas &quot;a platform that weaves together our caring needs over a lifetime.&quot;;   Such an agenda may first require this erstwhile anger. For one of theobstacles to progress is an apparent lack of interest.;    According to MaryJane Gibson, an 11-year veteran of the Massachusetts House of Representativesand another voice in Gordon's book, women don't help themselves.;    &quot;Youngworking women who are married and feel a sense of responsibility to theirfamilies don't feel they have the energy to organize collectively or even tocontact their legislators individually,&quot; says Gibson. &quot;They aren't makingenough demands, either at their workplaces or to their politicalrepresentatives.&quot;;    Meanwhile business is making plenty of demands.;    &quot;Weget letters and phone calls from the business community,&quot; says Gibson. &quot;Andtheir first priority is definitely to kill these care-related bills.&quot;;   Lobbyists for the Family and Medical Leave Act, which would give women unpaidleave at the birth or adoption of a baby, have been waging war against -- whatelse? -- the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.;    Business fears the act will be &quot;afoot in the door for a whole series of mandated benefits that women areseeking,&quot; says Donna Lemhoff, director of the Women's Legal Defense fund inWashington, D.C.;    And as everybody knows, let those women get a foot in thedoor and next thing you know they'll be asking to work at home while theirsick children play in the next room.
