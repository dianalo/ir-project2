The right-wing army general went on the political offensive forthe first time since he lost an Oct. 5 referendum to extend his termuntil 1997.   ``The situation we find ourselves in is without doubt delicate,''Pinochet told about 800 supporters Thursday night in this provincialcity. ``It would be fatal and insincere to try to hide it.   ``I see with much concern that the same political formulas thatin the past dragged the country into an unprecedented crisis are nowreturning,'' Pinochet said. ``What's even more serious is that theyare (promoted by) the same people who destroyed our fatherland, ourdemocracy just 15 years ago.''   Pinochet led a September 1973 coup that toppled the electedgovernment of President Salvador Allende, a Marxist, duringwidespread economic and social disorder. Allende died in the coup.   ``The causes of the confrontation of Chilean against Chileancannot be allowed to repeat themselves,'' Pinochet said. ``We haveto realize the dangerous time in which we live and call onpatriotism to overcome this situation.''   He said the twin dangers were growing terrorism andMarxist-Leninism.   Gabriel Valdes, a leader of the centrist Christian Democrats, thecountry's largest party, discounted Pinochet's remarks as a sign heremains ``in shock'' from the referendum's outcome. ``He continuesto be wounded by the defeat,'' Valdes told reporters in Santiago onFriday.   Other opposition leaders, however, have said a hard line byPinochet is designed to provoke street demonstrations or otheropposition that could be used in an effort to justify repression.   In the referendum, Chileans rejected a proposal by Pinochet andthe other military commanders that he remain in power until 1997.About 55 percent voted ``no'' and 43 percent voted ``yes'' with theremainder of votes voided.   On this week's tour, Pinochet said the vote showed the good faithof his military regime and allowed a reaffirmation of theeight-year-old constitution.   Under that document, the defeat forces Pinochet to call an openelection, planned for December 1989, and hand power over to thewinner in March 1990.   Pinochet has pledged to turn over power, but he had notexplicitly said he would not run himself.   The opposition is pressing for constitutional changes, includinga quicker departure of Pinochet from the presidency. They say someamendments are also needed to ensure full democratic powers for afuture elected government.</TEXT></DOC>
