Unitary representations ofthe conformal and superconformal algebras give constraints on possiblevalues of critical indices. For N = 0,1,2 Kac-determinant formurae havebeen obtained and possible values of the central charge c, highest weightand U(1) charge and corresponding characters for unitary irreduciblerepresentation have been derived. Unitary representations of the (super)conformalalgebra are realized by several methods (free fermions, free bosons,free fermions and bosons, Z/sub N/-currents and a free boson....). Itis known that fermionic representation of (super)conformal algebra isrelevant to construct some models which are difficult to realized bybosons or boson-fermion models by projection. In the case of N = 2, representationswith C/3 {ge} 1 are also important in their relevance to the compactificationof superstring. In this report we derive conditions for fermionic constructionof N = 1,2 superconformal algebras and obtain some solutions for theseconditions.</TEXT></DOC>
