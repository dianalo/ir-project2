It was recognized asthe result of examination that the technical capability of the applicantis appropriate. It was judged as the result of examination that the safetyafter this alteration of reactor installation can be ensured. The mechanicaldesign and the nuclear characteristics of the fuel assembly of 36 fuelrods having axial enrichment distribution and containing gadolinia, whichcomprises the uranium dioxide fuel rods containing gadolinia and theplutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel rods having axial enrichment distributionor the already permitted plutonium-uranium mixed oxide fuel rods, wereinvestigated. Gadolinia is chemically stable, and does not give harmfuleffect to cladding tudes. The axial distribution of the degree of enrichmentof uranium and plutonium does not affect the mechanical design of fuelelements. It was confirmed that there is no problem in the nuclear designof the core. (Kako, I.).</TEXT></DOC>
