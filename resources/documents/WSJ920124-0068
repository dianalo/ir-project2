As his employerclosed one office after another, the 40-year-old techniciansays, he and his family had to move three times in one year.Finally, &quot;I couldn't stand it anymore,&quot; he says. LastFebruary, he quit.   Meanwhile, some ATandamp;T customers in Mr. Caron's oldterritory were also growing exasperated. &quot;Our {ATandamp;T} circuitswere out constantly, and I couldn't get them fixed on time,&quot;says Garry Russell, telecommunications chief at the KeyServices unit of KeyCorp, the Albany, N.Y.-based regionalbank. So &quot;we gave our circuits&quot; to ATandamp;T competitors. &quot;ATandamp;Tstill thinks it's the only game in town; it isn't.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Such is the ill will ATandamp;T is risking, among key employeesand among customers, as it pursues a streamlining anddownsizing of rare proportions. The danger, say many whofollow the company closely, is that in its determination tobecome efficient and flexible ATandamp;T may be jeopardizing thereputation for reliability that is one of its central assets.   These are tumultuous times at ATandamp;T as it struggles tofight off aggressive competitors and adjust to the newtelephone era. Its efforts since the forced telephonedivestiture eight years ago have included wave upon wave oflayoffs and transfers -- eliminating more than 100,000 jobs,or a fourth of its payroll -- and a decentralizing thatcreated 20 separate operating units.   Many investors and industry analysts praise the results.Once belittled for its lumbering ways, ATandamp;T now runsbusinesses that are becoming more cost-competitive and agile.It has halted losses in its consumer phone business and hastaken radical steps to reduce the heavy losses in officephone systems. It has stanched its computer red ink by buyingthe profitable computer company NCR. Meanwhile, ATandamp;T haslaunched new businesses such as the Universal credit card andthe credit leasing unit ATandamp;T Capital Corp. that are growingrobustly.   But despite these efforts, ATandamp;T yesterday reported a dropin earnings for last year and the fourth quarter, on revenuethat was essentially flat. Chairman Robert Allen said thetrends at ATandamp;T are favorable regardless of the report. Butanalysts such as Michael Kennedy of Arthur D. Little say muchof the improvement at ATandamp;T reflects not new business but itssteep cost cuts, and he warns that &quot;you can't downsizeforever. Sooner or later, you must find new sources ofrevenue.&quot;   That won't be made easier if service quality is declining,as some customers think it is. A typical complaint comes fromDavid Chatman, UAL Corp.'s telecommunications manager. AtUAL's Denver facility, he says, &quot;ATandamp;T sent inexperiencedtechnicians who had to ask our people how to get into ATandamp;T'sown computer. That type of incompetence you don't need.&quot;Dissatisfied with ATandamp;T's equipment maintenance, UAL did someswitching of its own in late 1990. It hired InterWestCommunications Corp., of Denver, to work on its phonesystems.   Sometimes the technicians who do show up aren't reallyfrom ATandamp;T, annoyed customers say. In Columbus, Ohio, &quot;ATandamp;Tsubcontracted work on our system to another company thatdidn't know what it was doing,&quot; says Dominic Caminiti,service director at Quality Chevrolet, a car dealer. &quot;Theirmistake ended up costing us about $1,500. . . . If I'm payingfor an expensive ATandamp;T maintenance contract, I should begetting an ATandamp;T technician who knows my system. If I buyanother system, I don't think I'll buy ATandamp;T again. I don'tfeel like a valued customer.&quot;   ATandamp;T's long-distance network, after decades ofreliability, has failed four times in two years. An outagelast September cut voice communications in the Northeast,hobbled Wall Street and closed down the air-traffic-controlsystem on the East Coast. The company itself blamed three ofthe four failures on worker and management carelessness.   ATandamp;T hasn't any comment on specific complaints like Mr.Chatman's and Mr. Caminiti's. Jerre Stead, president of ATandamp;TBusiness Communications Systems, says, &quot;I'm well aware ofcustomer concerns. . . . ATandamp;T has the largest direct serviceforce. We're not doing any outside contracting ofconsequence, {only in} some remote areas of the country.&quot;   Mr. Allen says, &quot;Most of our people are aggressivelyserving customers and winning customers, working flat out.&quot;   Few hard figures on service complaints exist at either thefederal or state level. New York's Public Service Commissionsays MCI Communications Corp. and U.S. Sprint CommunicationsCo. still draw many more complaints than ATandamp;T, but the gap isnarrowing. Complaints against ATandamp;T edged up last year to 0.29per 100,000 customers from 0.25 in 1990. MCI scored 1.82 in1991, vs. 3.1 the year before; Sprint had 1.18 in 1991 vs.2.04 in 1990.   Real or perceived, ATandamp;T's service problems are a benefitto ATandamp;T's rivals, suggests Stephen Sazegari,telecommunications analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose,Calif. &quot;ATandamp;T's service is slipping, leading corporatecustomers to competitive carriers such as MCI,&quot; Mr. Sazegarisays. While ATandamp;T is slowing the overall erosion of itslong-distance market share, he estimates that in the giantcorporate long-distance arena, ATandamp;T's share fell to 61% lastyear from 80% three years ago. And he predicts it will slipto 55% by 1993. (However, the market itself is growing.)   In the equipment area, Dataquest says rival NorthernTelecom Ltd. has overtaken ATandamp;T as the lead supplier oftelecommunications switching equipment to the Bell operatingcompanies and to business users. &quot;ATandamp;T has to change itsentire approach to service,&quot; Mr. Sazegari believes.&quot;Phone-company customers in particular are not happy withtheir delivery of software or level of service.&quot;   Nimble rivals such as MCI, Northern Telecom and Japaneseequipment makers have been relentless in their pursuit ofATandamp;T customers, spending huge sums on ads that target giantATandamp;T. And ATandamp;T has counterattacked with a billion-dollar adprogram claiming its rivals are inferior. Stephen Dexter, anexecutive of Kemper Financial Services Inc., says that &quot;withlong-distance now a commodity business, if ATandamp;T isn'tservicing its customer base it has a serious long-termproblem. MCI and others will continue grabbing disgruntledcustomers.&quot;   Some suggest that the service complaints are related to achange in the way ATandamp;T prices are regulated. Until about fouryears ago, the FCC allowed ATandamp;T to earn a certain return oninvestment. But it switched to setting price caps, a methodthat helps keep customer prices down but encourages thecompany to cut costs in order to widen the margin.   Another possible factor is the regional consolidation ATandamp;Thas carried out. Mr. Kennedy of Arthur D. Little says some ofhis clients don't like &quot;ATandamp;T's consolidating of its networkmanagement into major hubs,&quot; a move they think results in&quot;not enough local contact.&quot; His consulting clients, whichinclude defense contractors, utilities and banks, also sayATandamp;T &quot;doesn't have enough service people,&quot; Mr. Kennedy says.&quot;I'm hearing a lot of complaints about how ATandamp;T's servicequality is slipping because of cutbacks.&quot;   Charles Anderson, who is an ATandamp;T technician and unionofficial in Los Angeles, says customers who need speedyservice may be inconvenienced because of the cutbacks. In1984, when ATandamp;T was broken up, its district technical forcein California had 10 community groups of technicians, called&quot;garages.&quot; Now, says Mr. Anderson, &quot;we're down to one garageper district, and my average driving time between jobs is ahalf hour to 1 1/2 hours; it used to be 10 to 15 minutes.&quot;   The service complaints don't surprise Brian Moir, chiefcounsel for the International Communications Association,which represents 700 of the nation's largest communicationscustomers. &quot;If you look at the number of ATandamp;T employeesinvolved in long-distance service, their numbers areconstantly shrinking and they're in areas of critical concernto corporate users,&quot; he says. &quot;We're not talking about thehandholding marketing types, but the actual people who areconstructing and maintaining customer networks. ATandamp;T needsthese veterans, not the kiddie corps.&quot; Mr. Moir says hisorganization is hearing &quot;higher and higher levels&quot; ofcomplaints from ICA members about ATandamp;T's service.   Could the service complaints be related to ATandamp;T workermorale? Measuring this is always difficult. Any company hasat least a few disgruntled employees, and companies that mustadapt to a changing technological and business climate arelikely to have quite a few. But ATandamp;T's own studies showunusual work-force dislocation.   One of ATandamp;T's labor practices is to notify workers thatthey could be taken off the payroll unless they can findanother position within the organization on their own. Atleast 43% of ATandamp;T's non-management employees have receivedsuch notices, says Jeffrey Keefe, a Rutgers Universitymanagement professor who collaborated on an ATandamp;T-financedsurvey of employee attitudes about the cutbacks. Thosesurveyed said they had averaged 2 1/2 such &quot;surplusing&quot;notices. &quot;I was shocked,&quot; Prof. Keefe says.   Jack B. Grubman, a telecommunications analyst atPaineWebber Inc. who used to work at ATandamp;T himself, considersmorale a serious problem for the company. ATandamp;T employees are&quot;angry and frustrated, and it's hurting quality,&quot; he says.&quot;Morale stinks. ATandamp;T has to turn the situation around.&quot;   Especially beleaguered were ATandamp;T workers who had beentransferred from a closed-down facility in San Leandro,Calif., to a new high-tech warehouse, maintenance and servicecenter in Memphis, Tenn. The new center was to service bigcorporate clients; with Federal Express Corp.'s main hubnearby, phone equipment could be shipped efficientlyanywhere. But after the merger, ATandamp;T said it would shut theoperation and move much of the work to its new acquisitionNCR, which operates a neighboring facility.   &quot;ATandamp;T people were recruited from within {the company} twoyears ago, brought in because of their expertise and toldthat they would be here for at least five to seven years,&quot;says Kenneth D. Bishop, a shipping clerk in the Memphis plantand a representative for the Communications Workers ofAmerica. &quot;They didn't even make it one year. People feelstabbed in the back.&quot;   Adds John Webster, an ATandamp;T production manager in Memphis:&quot;A lot of us are saying, `The hell with the company.' Manyspouses, like my wife, gave up good-paying jobs to follow ushere. Management doesn't realize that when they close afacility, they're also dealing with families.&quot; At ATandamp;T'sDenver network center, Leslie Hodgman, a communicationstechnician with 19 years at the company, says she alwayswears a button with Chairman Allen's picture on it and a redline through it. &quot;We all do,&quot; she says. &quot;He's the one we hatethe most.&quot;   Mr. Allen is used to the ire directed at him. &quot;It's notunusual for everyone to focus on me as the bad guy. Do I likeit? Hell, no.&quot; But with better technology, he says, ATandamp;Tsimply needs fewer workers. &quot;We want to stay competitive andprotect the jobs of the 325,000 people who remain here,&quot; hesays.   Workers concede that when ATandamp;T does dismiss employees, itoffers better severance benefits than most companies do, aswell as top-notch job counseling. When downsizing seemed tohave led to a mental-health crisis at some Texas facilities,ATandamp;T quickly flew in experts to counsel employees, with theunion's help.   As for complaints that continual office closings haveturned some ATandamp;T service technicians into high-tech migrantworkers, Mr. Allen acknowledges &quot;some wrong moves&quot; as ATandamp;Thas shrunk. &quot;Those kinds of things are not happening now,&quot; hecontends.   Yet the recent series of power outages has exposeddistinct flaws in ATandamp;T network management that are directlyattributable to cost-cutting. At its 52-story Thomas Streetcenter in lower Manhattan, ATandamp;T cut seven power techniciansfrom a staff of 10. ATandamp;T also began a &quot;power shedding&quot;arrangement with Consolidated Edison Co. of New York underwhich ATandamp;T agreed to switch to its own diesel generators acouple of times a year in return for a rate discount to about$8 per kilowatt hour from $20.   At Con Edison's request on a sweltering day lastSeptember, ATandamp;T switched to its own generators. But theswitchover damaged equipment that fed power to the switchingcenter, and its emergency batteries quickly ran down. Nobodyin the ATandamp;T facility heard or saw the alarms warning of thepower problem because a supervisor had taken his techniciansto power-alarm class, and because cost-cutting had left thecenter insufficiently staffed.   ATandamp;T said its own investigation showed shoddy maintenancecaused the alarms to malfunction. But workers at the facilitysay a supervisor ordered employees to dismantle most of thealarms. His reason: The workers were stretched thin bycost-cutting, and he didn't want them distracted. Mr. Allennow acknowledges that the alarms were dismantled, but he addsthat the &quot;motivation wasn't some new work process. It was amisjudgment.&quot;   Harold W. Burlingame, ATandamp;T's senior vice president ofhuman resources, believes morale &quot;probably reached a lowpoint in 1987. Since then, we have been in an upward trend inthe way {workers} look at the business. . . . We probablyhave several thousand workers whose jobs have been preservedthrough extraordinary means.&quot; Mr. Allen adds that the worstof the cost-cutting &quot;is behind us.&quot;   That will be welcome news to customers like Steve Kennedy,director of telecommunications for Southwest Airlines inDallas: &quot;The problems we're having with ATandamp;T maintenance andservice are driving us to other vendors,&quot; he says. &quot;Itappears ATandamp;T is getting spread pretty thin.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          A PAGE ONE ARTICLE about American Telephone andamp; TelegraphCo. on Friday incorrectly attributed a quotation to JohnWebster, an ATandamp;T manager in Memphis, Tenn. The statement wasactually made by Kenneth D. Bishop, a subordinate of his. Mr.Webster wasn't interviewed for the article.   (WSJ Jan. 27, 1992)</TEXT></DOC>
