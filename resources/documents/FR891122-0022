Adjustmentsmust reflect changes in the fair market rents (FMRs) prevailing in particularmarket areas or be based on a reasonable formula.This Notice establishes revised Annual Adjustment Factors (AAFs) basedon a formula using rent and utility data from the Consumer Price Index(CPI) and using the Bureau of the Census American Housing Surveys (AHS).The revised AAFs are to be used to adjust Contract Rents under the section8 Housing Assistance Payments Programs. HUD regulations provide that theAAFs will be published annually in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (24 CFR 888.202). The annual anniversary datefor publication of the AAFs is November 8. These revised AAFs apply (subjectto the limitations on applicability discussed below) to adjust ContractRents on or after November 8, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicability of AAFs to Various Section 8 Programs</ITAG>In general, AAFs established by this Notice are used to adjust ContractRents for section 8 units. The following provides a general descriptionof how AAFs apply under the several section 8 Housing Assistance PaymentsPrograms. The application of the AAFs should be determined by referenceto the HAP Contract and to appropriate program regulations.In certain cases, AAFs are not used to adjust Contract Rents. AAFs arenot used for section 8 Certificate Program units under a HAP contract forsubsidized units subject to 24 CFR 882.110(d), which applies to units incertain otherwise subsidized projects that are rented to section 8 CertificateProgram families. (The housing assistance payment for such a unit is equalto the difference between the subsidized rent and the rent payable by theeligible family. Adjustments to the subsidized rents are made in accordancewith rules and procedures governing the particular subsidized housing programinvolved.) In addition, AAFs are not used for units placed under HAP contractin recent years under the section 202/section 8 Program. Instead, rentsare based on a HUD-approved budget for the project.Contract Rents for many projects receiving section 8 subsidies under theLoan Management provisions of 24 CFR part 886, subpart A, and for projectsreceiving section 8 subsidies under the Property Disposition provisionsof 24 CFR part 886, subpart C, are adjusted, at HUD's option, either byapplying the AAFs or by adjusting rents in accordance with 24 CFR 207.19(e)(2) and (e)(4).The AAFs developed by the formula apply to rental units of all bedroomsizes in each rent interval. Under the section 8 Moderate RehabilitationProgram, the public housing agency (PHA) should use the base rent, notthe Contract Rent, to select the correct AAF to apply to the base rent.Each AAF applies to a specified geographical area, as indicated in theTable at the end of this document. Program participants should refer tothe Table that provides the list of states included in each of the fourCensus Regions and the metropolitan areas with separate local CPI surveys(defined by counties or New England towns) to make certain that they areusing the correct factors. Units located in metropolitan areas with separatelocal CPI surveys must use the corresponding AAFs for that metropolitanarea. Units that are located outside those metropolitan areas with separatelocal CPI surveys must use the AAFs for the respective Census Region withinwhich the state is located.Application of an AAF to the prior Contract Rent for a unit may not resultin material differences between the rents charged for assisted units andunassisted units of similar quality and age in the same market area, asdetermined by the Secretary. (See 42 U.S.C. 1437f(c)(2)(C), and the applicableprogram regulations in 24 CFR chapter VIII.) Thus, an AAF for an entireprimary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA) may not be uniformly applicableto all rental housing within that broad area, if a project-specific rentcomparability test shows that a material difference exists between therents charged for assisted projects and unassisted projects of similarquality and age in the same market area.In certain cases, however, the AAF established for a particular area mayresult in rents that are substantially lower than rents charged for comparableunits not receiving assistance under the section 8 Program. If this occurs,a PHA or private owner may apply to the HUD Field Office for considerationof a revised AAF for the area, as provided in 24 CFR 888.204. Owners of section 8 units (other than units assisted under the section8 Certificate and FmHA Programs) who have HAP Contracts with anniversarydates falling on November 8, 1989 through November 22, 1989 may requestthat the AAFs be applied retroactively to the anniversary date of theirHAP Contracts. Retroactivity is permitted to avoid any detriment to ownersbecause of HUD's delay in the annual publication of the factors as requiredby 24 CFR 888.202. For units assisted under the section 8 Certificate andthe FmHA Programs, the factors are not applied retroactively; the annualadjustments, as of any anniversary date, are determined using the AAFsmost recently published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (see 24 CFR 882.108(a)(1) and 884.109(b)(2).<ITAG tagnum="84">Calculation of Adjustment Factors </ITAG>AAFs are provided for the four Census Regions, the states of Alaska andHawaii, and the 72 metropolitan areas with local CPI surveys (listed inalphabetical order). As a result of decreases in the local CPI surveys, the Department is publishingAAFs that are less that 1.00 for two metropolitan areas in Colorado andfive metropolitan areas in Texas. These areas are: the Denver PMSA; theBoulder PMSA; the Houston PMSA; the Brazoria PMSA, the Galveston-TexasCity PMSA; the Dallas PMSA; and the Fort Worth-Arlington PMSA. The AAFsfor the state of Alaska, also less than 1.00, are based on a reductionin the Anchorage CPI. AAFs that are less than 1.00 normally would result in rent reductions.However, section 8(c)(2)(C) of the 1937 Act, as amended by section 142(d)of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, prohibits the reductionof contract rents for newly constructed, substantially rehabilitated, ormoderately rehabilitated projects (including projects assisted under section8 as in effect prior to November 30, 1983), unless the project has beenrefinanced in a manner that reduces the periodic payments of the owner.Therefore, contract rents for newly constructed, substantially rehabilitatedor moderately rehabilitated projects (including projects assisted undersection 8 as in effect prior to November 30, 1983) in areas with factorsof less than 1.00 will not be reduced as a result of such factors. Except for rent adjustments for manufactured home space rents under thesection 8 Certificate Program, the formula for calculating the AAFs foreach area was developed as follows: (1) The increases in the residentialrent component and the fuel and utilities component of the CPI were basedon the most recent available average annual changes; (2) a shelter rentfactor was calculated by eliminating the effect of heating costs on theCPI residential rent component as determined by Bureau of Labor Statisticsdata; (3) a gross rent factor for each of the metropolitan areas coveredby the CPI and for each of the four Census Regions was calculated by weightingthe shelter rent and the fuel and utility changes in accordance with updated1980 Census State weights of these component parts of rent; (4) AAFs forContract Rents including the highest cost utility were calculated by adjustingthe gross rent factors to reflect variations by rent range in each area,based on variations developed from 1987 national AHS data as applied tothe local FMR levels; and (5) AAFs for Contract Rents excluding the highestcost utility were calculated by developing updated shelter rents from theupdated gross rents, by rent ranges, and then dividing the updated shelterrents by that of the previous year.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section 8 Certificate Program AAFs for Manufactured Home Spaces </ITAG>This Notice contains a separate set of AAFs for adjusting Contract Rentsfor manufactured home spaces. There is one factor for each area, whichrepresents the change in the median rent for the area. These factors werederived by following steps one and two in the formula described above.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters </ITAG>An environmental assessment is unnecessary, since revising Annual AdjustmentFactors is categorically excluded from the Department's National EnvironmentalPolicy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(<T3>1</T3>). The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of ExecutiveOrder 12612, <T3>Federalism</T3>, has determined that the policies contained in thisNotice do not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subject toreview under the Order. The Notice merely announces the adjustment factorsto be used to adjust contract rents in the section 8 Housing AssistancePayment Programs, as required by the United States Housing Act of 1937.The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,The Family, has also determined that this Notice does not have potentialsignificant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-beingand, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The Notice merelyannounces the adjustment factors to be used to adjust contract rents inthe section 8 Housing Assistance Payment Programs, as required by the UnitedStates Housing Act of 1937. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number for Lower IncomeHousing Assistance Programs (section 8) is 14.156. Accordingly, the Department publishes these Contract Rent Annual AdjustmentFactors for the section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program as set forthin the following tables:<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Peter H.
