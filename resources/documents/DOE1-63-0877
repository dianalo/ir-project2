Dewatering processes and the toothpaste-like product of somesystems create serious disposal problems and act as a source of groundwatercontamination. Thus, North American experience of current technologyhas converted an air pollution problem into a water pollution problem.This proposal addresses these partiuclar problems in three ways. Firstly,it proposes to produce a state of the art review on scrubber processconditions, and the applications and environmental impact of by-productsand wastes produced. Secondly, it proposes an experimental program todevelop useable by-product gypsum by means of wet scrubber technology,thus eliminating disposal problems and adding a possible financial returnon investment on pollution control devices. Thirdly, it is proposed toestablish optimun flue gas desulfurization conditions which minimizethe enviornmental impact of process waste/washwater. 4 refs., 3 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
