Fans of the stocks argue that even if oil prices ease nextyear, these companies that provide geological research,equipment and other services for oil drilling will stilloutperform both the market and the major oil companies.</LP><TEXT>   There is reason for investors to be finicky. Increasedexploration for oil around the world is tempting somemarginal, as well as strong, companies to raise money on WallStreet.   &quot;You want to take a long, hard look at the companiescoming public now,&quot; says Miles J. Cohen, a portfolio managerfor Norwest Bank Minnesota, in Minneapolis. Smaller companiescould suffer in an industry increasingly dominated by suchgiants as Baker Hughes Inc., Dresser Industries Inc.,Halliburton Co. and Schlumberger Ltd. &quot;Unless they have aparticular niche, they'll have a tough time,&quot; says Mr. Cohen.   But investors who haven't yet climbed on the energybandwagon may find some bargains among better-quality newissues. &quot;The trends are still going in your favor,&quot; advisesAnthony Socci, energy sector analyst for Dreyfus Corp., NewYork.   Barring sudden peace in the Mideast, oil prices areexpected to stay high enough to stimulate increasedexploration and production. By November, prices could climbto $35 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate crude oil, saysWilliam H. Brown III, oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.However, as new supplies flow, prices could fall to the low20s within a year, Mr. Brown predicts. That drop should hurtthe stocks of major oil companies more than oil-servicestocks, he adds.   At worst, oil-service stocks could drop 10% to 15% overthe next two years if oil prices collapse, estimates JamesCarroll, oil-service analyst for PaineWebber Inc. Morelikely, he thinks oil stocks will rise 50% to 100% duringthat period as companies scramble to keep up with newexploration and production. That ascent &quot;will be filled withplenty of potholes&quot; as stocks react to fluctuating oilprices, he warns.   New issues, some of them already priced at 10% to 15%discounts to existing oil-service stocks, could becomecheaper as investment bankers try to please investorsfrightened by the crumbling new issues market, Mr. Carrolladds. &quot;From the standpoint of the buyer, it's a wonderfultime to look at new deals,&quot; he says.   Among the oil-service IPOs scheduled for a debut this fallare:                                                                                                          Grant-Norpac: At an expected $10 to $12 apiece,Grant-Norpac's four million shares will be reasonably pricedbased on the seismic company's estimated 1991 earnings of 80cents to $1 a share, says Mr. Socci. None of the Houstoncompany's insiders are selling, which tells Mr. Socci &quot;theydon't think this is the top&quot; for the shares. Grant-Norpaccollects, processes and markets seismic data for land-basedoil exploration, and ranks number five among such companies.More than 60% of revenue comes from overseas -- none in Iraqor Kuwait. Risks include currency fluctuations and politicaluncertainty. Underwriters are Salomon Brothers Inc. andHoward, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs.                                                                                                          Moorco: At an indicated range of $10 to $12 a share,Moorco's initial offering looks attractive to Robert Natale,emerging-growth stock analyst for Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. TheHouston company makes fluid measurement and pressure controlproducts for the energy industry. Moorco estimates 1991earnings at $1 a share, according to Mr. Natale, putting itsprice-to-earnings multiple below that of a similar publiccompany, Daniel Industries. Moorco will offer four millioncommon shares as insiders sell two million; proceeds will beused to redeem preferred shares and reduce debt. Underwritersare PaineWebber Inc. and Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co.                                                                                                          Input/Output: Currently a subsidiary of Triton EnergyCorp., the Stafford, Texas, maker of seismic data acquisitionsystems depends heavily on sales of its $2 million system. In1990, 84% of revenue came from selling this system. Tritonwill own 28% after an offering of 3.2 million shares byTriton and 1.7 million shares by the company, at an indicatedrange of $9 to $11 apiece. Mr. Natale is leery of thereliance on one big-ticket item, saying there are too manyuncertainties for him. &quot;You really have to be careful,&quot;agrees one West Coast money manager. &quot;There's no way to knowif a company will lose or gain a contract.&quot; Underwriters arePaineWebber and Salomon.                                                                                                          Vetco Gray: The Houston maker of oil exploration andproduction equipment is planning an initial offering of ninemillion shares at an indicated $17 to $19 apiece to buy backa controlling interest held by Bain Venture Capital. Theheavy insider selling by the venture capitalists &quot;throws up acaution flag&quot; for Mr. Natale. &quot;If this is such a goodinvestment, why are these people pulling $118 million out?&quot;he asks. Nonetheless, he says he advised investors to buy theoffering if shares can be had for $15. Combustion Engineeringwill increase its 20% stake as a result of the offering.Underwriters are Salomon and Shearson Lehman Brothers.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks again fell prey to increasedtensions in the Mideast and worries about the economy.
