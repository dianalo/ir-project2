Adopts 'Poison Pill' To Fight B.A.T Bid </HL><SO> </SO><CO> FGRP BTI </CO><IN> TNM INS </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Farmers Group Inc., which has been fighting a $4.5 billion hostile bid by B.A.T Industries PLC, said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or a &quot;poison pill&quot; defense.    Under the plan, Farmers will issue rights which entitle shareholders to buy additional shares at half price if an outsider acquires 20% or more of the company's stock.    Farmers, a Los Angeles-based insurance holding company, has declared B.A.T's $63-a-share bid inadequate and is fighting B.A.T in the nine states where the British company needs regulatory clearance to proceed with its tender offer. B.A.T is a London-based tobacco, retailing and financial services giant.    B.A.T termed the shareholder rights plan &quot;another indication of Farmers' entrenched board of directors.&quot; B.A.T said the plan also shows that Farmers &quot;doesn't in reality believe it will be successful in stopping the acquisition at the state regulatory level.&quot;    The California insurance commissioner has ruled against B.A.T's bid and B.A.T has filed a suit in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking to overturn that ruling. If B.A.T doesn't obtain a reversal of the ruling, it will have to drop the offer because state laws require regulatory approval for any investor to buy a stake of 10% or more in an insurer.    Under the shareholder rights plan, the rights will be issued July 5 and will expire in 10 years unless recalled by management earlier. If the plan is triggered each share of Farmers would carry the right for its owner to pay $160 for $320 worth of Farmer's stock or stock in the acquiring company.    Separately, a shareholder filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Farmers Group and ten of its directors charging breach of duty to shareholders. The suit, which seeks status as a class-action suit, asks the court to block the company from issuing the shareholder rights and to order the rights redeemed if they have been issued.    The suit also alleges that the sole reason the directors are fighting the B.A.T bid is to entrench themselves. Further, it charges the directors refused to give financial information to B.A.T, thereby making it impossible for B.A.T to make its highest offer to shareholders.    The suit asks the court to order the directors to cooperate fully with any parties interested in a bona fide transaction.    Officials at Farmers couldn't be reached for comment on the suit. </TEXT></DOC>
