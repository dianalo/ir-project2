EPA's Office of Emergency and RemedialResponse considers this report along with other information when adjustingreportable quantities under CERCLA section 102.EPA's Air Quality Criteria for Lead, especially Volume III, has been usedextensively as a reference in the preparation of this carcinogenicity assessment.The Air Quality Criteria for Lead has had considerable peer review, includingreview by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee of the Science AdvisoryBoard in public sessions. The four-volume set is available from the NationalTechnical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Roybal Road, Springfield,Virginia 22161 (Telephone 703/487-4650). The NTS publication numbers andapproximate costs are:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Volume I PB87-142386 $24.95</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Volume II PB87-142394 $30.95</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Volume III PB87-142402 $30.95</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Volume IV PB87-142410 $36.95</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">SET PB87-142378 $105.50The lead evaluation reflects two factors that the Agency considers importantin characterizing potential carcinogens: weight of evidence and potency.Information in the report has been organized as described in EPA's Guidelinesfor Carcinogen Risk Assessment. Section 1 develops the weight of evidence(the strength of the evidence that a substance cause cancer) accordingto the Guidelines. It has subsections dealing with human studies, long-termanimal studies, short-term tests, toxicologic effects other than carcinogenicitythat are relevant to the evaluation of carcinogenicity, and pharmacokineticproperties. Section 2 discusses potency (the strength of a substance tocause cancer), and section 3 combines the weight of evidence and the potencyinto an overall hazard ranking for potential carcinogenicity as requiredfor the reportable quantities program.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Erich Bretthauer,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Administrator for Research and Development.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-7323 Filed 3-27-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
