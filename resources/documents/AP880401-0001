A statement said Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan fled at about2:30 a.m. Saturday (1:30 p.m. EST Friday) aboard two rubber boatsalong with 13 other people, including some of his guards.   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered a massive search forthe 39-year-old Honasan and alerted subordinate commands nationwideto be on the lookout for him.   The charismatic former colonel had been detained on the navyship since his arrest last December in a Manila suburb.   Col. Oscar Florendo, chief military spokesman, said a reservelieutenant who was frustrated over his inability to obtain aregular commission had aided in the getaway.   Florendo said the boats used in the escape had been sent toincrease security after the military learned of a plot to freeHonasan.   De Villa immediately relieved the commander of the vessel, theRPS Andres Bonifacio, and ordered his arrest, Florendo said in aradio address. He appealed to the public to provide information tohelp recapture Honasan.   Honasan, former chief of security at the Defense Ministry,played a key role in the Feb. 22, 1986, mutiny which triggered thepopular uprising that toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.   But Honasan became disillusioned with Marcos' successor,President Corazon Aquino, accusing her of ``weak and inept''leadership that fortified the 18-year-old communist insurgency.   On Aug. 28, Honasan led a force of 2,000 men who attacked thepresidential palace and seized several media and militaryinstallations in the capital before they were driven off bypro-Aquino forces.   The coup attempt left 53 people dead and wounded hundreds, andMrs. Aquino said it was aimed at killing her and her family.   Honasan's effort was the most serious of several major plots tounseat Mrs. Aquino's government.   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theformer colonel was so popular that he had become the ``dominantfigure'' aboard the ship which was supposed to be his prison.   ``It is with sadness that the AFP (Armed Forces of thePhilippines) makes public the unfortunate escape from custody ofex-Col. Gregorio Honasan from his detention,'' Florendo said in astatement. ``During a normal inspection of the ship, it wasdiscovered that subject detainee together with his guards headed byLt. j.g. Gerardo Mojica and 12 enlisted personnel were foundmissing.   ``Initial investigation revealed that Honasan was apparentlyassisted and joined by his guards led by Lt j.g. Mojica ... It isbelieved that bribery was a factor that led to the betrayal oftheir oath and sworn duty.''   Florendo said de Villa had alerted the military to takeprecautions to ensure that Communist rebels did not take advantageof the confusion to launch ``terroristic actions.''   The spokesman said troops were being deployed around Manila tosearch for Honasan.   Florendo said the military received information a week ago thatHonasan would try to escape and it sent rubber boats to guard theship.   He said the military expected outsiders to try to storm thevessel but ``instead it came from the inside.''   Honasan was security chief of the Defense Ministry whenopposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile was minister of national defense.Enrile was fired in November 1986 after the government said itthwarted a coup attempt by his followers.   Honasan remained in hiding for months after the August coup.Brig. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the National CapitalRegional Defense Command, said weeks before the arrest that Honasanwas being protected by undisclosed civilian and military figures.</TEXT></DOC>
