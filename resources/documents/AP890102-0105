Moammar Gadhafi.   In West Germany, Bonn government officials announced they wereexamining the records of Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr, a company said tobe involved in the purported plant.   But no criminal investigation has begun into the activities ofthe company, local prosecutor Werner Botz said.   Imhausen-Chemie director Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen rejectedthe accusations in an interview with South German Radio in Stuttgartthat was broadcast late Monday. He said he hoped the governmentprobe would clear his firm of any wrongdoing.   Libya's JANA agency, monitored in Rome, noted that a reportSunday in a United Arab Emirates newspaper quoted unidentified Arabsources as saying America planned to send an assassination team tokill Gadhafi during an attack on Libya.   The daily Al-Khaleej said a U.S. task force trained for theattack is in Italy, Spain and aboard U.S. warships in theMediterranean and said it could come this month. It said the strikewould include air raids on a Libyan nuclear research center atTajura and the purported chemical weapons plant at Rabtah.   JANA said on Monday that a group it called the InternationalLeague in Defense of the Mediterranean condemned the sailing of anew U.S. 13-ship carrier battle group for the Mediterranean.   A U.S. Navy spokesman in Washington called the sailing a routinedeployment of the 6th Fleet. A Navy spokesman in Italy said the newgroup comes at the time of the normal rotation of the ships in theMediterranean.   The State Department in Washington said Monday it had no officeron duty to answer questions.   The report by Al-Khaleej report carried no dateline but appearedto originate in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.   JANA said, ``The uncovering of this terrorist plan reveals andexposes clearly the real motives and dimensions of the hystericalcampaign'' the U.S. government has mounted against Libya.   It said the report proves U.S. allegations about a chemical armsplant ``were excuses and pretexts for an operation of premeditatedindividual murder.''   Washington says Libya is about to produce chemical weapons at theplant near Rabtah, about 50 miles southwest of Tripoli. Libya saysthe plant makes pharmaceuticals and stresses Libya's commitment totreaties banning chemical weapons.   President Reagan has said the United States discussed with otherNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization nations the possibility ofmilitary action against the plant.   In Bonn, federal government spokesman Norbert Schaefer told anews conference authorities ``had no indication or evidence toverify the American suspicions'' that West German industry wasinvolved.   He said the allegations were brought to the government'sattention during Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to Washington inNovember, but Bonn had no ``concrete information'' to work with.   ``We must guarantee that German companies do not make profitsfrom the construction of death factories in Third World countries,''Helmut Ohnewald, a Christian Democratic state legislator fromBaden-Wuerttemberg, told reporters.   The Christian Democratic Union in Baden-Wuerttemberg, whereImhausen-Chemie is located, issued a statement demanding a fullprobe into the allegations.   The company's Hippenstiel-Imhausen said Imhausen-Chemie hadnothing to do with the Libyan factory, but had ``business contacts''in Libya relating to provision of materials for a plant to produceplastic bags.   Finance Ministry spokesman Karlheinz von den Driesch confirmedthat a foreign trade investigation was launched Friday as a``precautionary'' measure once Bonn learned that the name of theGerman firm implicated by the United States was to be made public.   He said no evidence was uncovered to suggest Imhausen-Chemie wasinvolved in wrongdoing.   Von den Driesch said the investigation would try to find whethermaterials could have been shipped to Libya indirectly through athird country.   Companies from West Germany, Japan and Italy are believed to havehelped Libya build the plant or the adjacent industrial complex,according to news reports in the United States. Japan told theUnited States its citizens believed they were involved in building afertilizer plant.   At least two West German firms provided Libya with chemicals,technical assistance and special pumps and piping for the plant,U.S. News andamp; World Report magazine said in a report released Sunday.   One company was identified as Imhausen-Chemie, the New York Timessaid Sunday, quoting U.S. government officials.</TEXT></DOC>
