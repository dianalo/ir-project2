For the quarter ended Nov. 30, the maker of electron tubes and semiconductors expects to show net income of about $2.7 million, or 25 cents to 27 cents a share, up from $2.1 million, or 20 cents a share, adjusted to reflect a 10% stock dividend paid last month. Sales were about $28.1 million, up from $24.4 million.    For the six months, Richardson expects to report net increased about 23% to about $4.8 million, or 46 cents to 48 cents a share, from $3.9 million, or 37 cents a share, adjusted for the stock dividend.    Six-months sales were about $53.5 million, up 16% from $46.3 million.    Edward J. Richardson, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company logged its higher results by continuing to absorb orders amid consolidation in the electron-tube industry. Television and radio broadcasters, airlines and the military, among others, still need tubes for their older equipment. Richardson generates about 75% of its sales from the replacement market.    The company continues an international expansion. This week it reported a distribution agreement with Siemens AG, the giant German electronics concern, that it projects will initially generate about $7 million to $10 million in revenue.    In recent years, Richardson has been building its business overseas because of stronger demand for tubes. By the end of its current fiscal year it expects 38% to 40% of its sales to be international, Mr. Richardson said.    Richardson also has grown rapidly through acquisitions and joint ventures. Mr. Richardson said he hopes to announce an acquisition in the current fiscal quarter. The company currently has about $90 million in cash, most of which came from a recent debt offering. </TEXT></DOC>
