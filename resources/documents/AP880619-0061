(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robert Summers Yellowtail Sr., apatriarch of the Crow Indian Tribe and a modern-day warrior whofought the tribe's battles with words, has died at the age of 98.   Yellowtail, who died at his home Saturday, studied law andplanned to become a lawyer, but instead became involved in tribalaffairs and politics. The University of Montana School of Laweventually awarded him an honorary degree.   Yellowtail said his most memorable experience was a war of wordsin the U.S. Capitol on April 6, 1917, when all the great chiefs ofthe Crow Tribe gathered in Washington to fight homesteading ontheir reservation, site of Custer's Last Stand on the LittleBighorn.   The chiefs met with the Senate Indian Affairs Committee todefend their people against a proposal by Sen. Thomas J. Walsh ofMontana, who wanted to open their reservation to white settlementand who had a reputation as one of the best legal minds of the era.   The old chiefs did not speak English and the task of arguingtheir case fell to Yellowtail, then a 28-year-old law student.   ``The gallery was jammed full of spectators,'' Yellowtail oncerecalled. ``They said I would have 18 minutes to answer Sen. Walsh,but I took 4{ hours.''   World War I interrupted his speech when the committee was calledto a special assembly in which President Woodrow Wilson askedCongress to declare war on Germany.   But the committee reconvened to hear Yellowtail and, when hefinished, Walsh withdrew his proposal.   Yellowtail served several times as tribal chairman, and theBureau of Indian Affairs appointed him superintendent of thereservation, the first Indian named to the post, which he held for11 years.   During the Eisenhower administration of the 1950s he was offeredthe post of commissioner of Indian affairs, but turned it down.   ``I never did get along with the Indian bureau, even when Iworked for it,'' he said.   Yellowtail Dam on the reservation is named for him, even thoughhe opposed the dam from the beginning and never changed his mind.   He also ran a successful cattle ranch near this southeasternMontana reservation town.   Funeral services were tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
