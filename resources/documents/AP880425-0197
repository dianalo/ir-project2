The measureis directed at U.S. military bases.   Sen. Wigberto Tanada, the main sponsor, said the proposedFreedom from Nuclear Weapons Act would give the Philippinegovernment ``legal and moral authority to put (the United States)on the defensive'' once it is approved by the 23-member Senate and200-member House of Representatives.   U.S. policy is to neither confirm nor deny the presence ofnuclear weapons on its warships or at the Clark Air Base and SubicNaval Base. They are the two main American bases here, and Filipinoanti-nuclear activists claim they provide storage or transshipmentpoints for nuclear arms.   ``Our best information ... is that there are nuclear weapons inthe bases and that is why we need to approve this legislation,''said Tanada.   The bill is expected to pass the Senate but to face strongopposition in the lower house.   Tanada said the measure would reaffirm a constitutionalprovision that bans nuclear weapons from Philippine territory``consistent with the national interest.''   A draft of the proposal says ``peaceful uses of nuclear energy''and commercial nuclear-powered ships would be excluded.Nuclear-capable ships ``in distress'' would be allowed access toPhilippine waters for a limited duration and with the Philippinepresident's permission.   The bill proposes creation of a monitoring commission.   Violators would face six years to life in prison, withforeigners to be deported after serving their jail term.   Also on Monday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said Filipinocommanders should have access to all areas of the two large U.S-runmilitary bases, including rooms where sensitive messages aredecoded.   The United States and the Philippines are reviewing the 1947Military Bases Agreement, under which the Americans maintain sixmilitary installations here.   The current agreement expires in 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
