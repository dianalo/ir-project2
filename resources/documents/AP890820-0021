Little progress on a chemical weapons treaty between the twosuperpowers had been reported until last month, when the Sovietsmoved toward the U.S. position on verification and the destructionof existing weapons stockpiles.   The focus shifts to the latest round of talks, which resumedThursday in Geneva and are expected to last 10 days. Talks began in1968.   ``I think there is reason to be optimistic, although a number ofdetails have to be worked out and with a treaty like this, theimportant stuff is in the details,'' said Lee Feinstein of the ArmsControl Association, a private group which monitors global armscontrol efforts.   John Isaacs, speaking for the Council for a Livable World, agreed.   ``I believe chances are pretty good for a treaty in the nextyear,'' said Isaacs, whose non-profit arms control group has oftenbeen critical of the Reagan and Bush administrations. ``The Bushadministration is pushing for it and there seems to be support inboth countries.   ``One major impetus was the extensive use by Iraq of chemicalweapons.''   Iraq used chemical weapons in its recent war with Iran, aconflict that ended a year ago with a cease-fire. Iraq reportedlyuse mustard gas and nerve gas, both against Iran and against its ownKurdish minority.   The war renewed attention on gas weapons, which had not beenextensively used since World War I.   Although only the United States and the Soviets admit to havingchemical weapons, CIA officials have told Congress they believe that15 to 20 nations possess the weapons.   Chemical weapons were first used in World War I by Germany. Theywere widely used by both sides and caused more than 1.3 millioncasualties. A 1925 treaty bans the first use of chemical weapons,although not their possession.   The U.S.-Soviet talks are taking place amid the 40-nationConference on Disarmament in Geneva. There is no guarantee thatother countries will accept any deal worked out by the twosuperpowers, said Feinstein.   But Gordon Burk of the Federation of American Scientists, anothernon-profit group which has been critical of the past twoadministrations, said he thinks a U.S.-Soviet treaty can be sold toother nations.   ``If the Soviets and the United States agree that they wantsomething and show a strong will, they can twist some arms,'' hesaid.   In recent months, the Soviets have generally been more upbeatthan the United States about prospects for a treaty. After the lastround of talks, Soviet officials said a treaty could be reached bythe end of this year, while U.S. officials said only that the talkshad been productive.   A major problem in verifying compliance is that many of thechemical components used in weapons can be produced in a variety ofplants, such as facilities built for fertilizers or pharmaceuticals.   One verification plan proposed by the United States and acceptedby the Soviets involves surprise inspections of sites either sidesuspected of being used to make gas weapons.   The Soviets had previously opposed such inspections, but abruptlychanged their stance. Now, the two sides have to work out details,such as whether observers from the challenging nation would beallowed to witness the inspection, according to U.S. officialsinvolved in the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Another unresolved question involves destruction of existingstockpiles and production facilities, the officials said.   Another hurdle is an exchange of data by both sides about thesize of location of each country's stockpile, according to theofficials. Although the size of the U.S. stockpile is classified, itis believed to be about 25,000 tons.   The Soviets claim to have 50,000 tons, although U.S. officialssay the Soviets may have up to 300,000 tons.   Any treaty would have to be ratified by the Senate, but the pacthas wide support in the Democratic-controlled Congress.   Last month, the House voted 414-4 approval of a resolutioncalling for a global ban. Recently, 75 of 100 senators signed aletter urging President Bush to push for a treaty.</TEXT></DOC>
