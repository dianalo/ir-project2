The joint maneuvers helped strengthen the dollar somewhat in the foreign exchange markets and bolstered hopes that Japanese investors will buy large amounts of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds. The Treasury next week will sell $29 billion of notes and bonds in its quarterly financing operation.    Following the lead of the bond and currency markets, stock prices also rose strongly, although some of the gains evaporated late in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up more than 50 points in mid-afternoon, wound up with an increase of 32.10 points to close at 2286.36.    Prices of actively traded 30-year Treasury issues soared about 2 1/2 points, or $25 for each $1,000 face amount. It was the biggest one-day surge in more than 10 months. The yield on some 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 8.42% from 8.68% Wednesday and as much as 8.85% early Monday.    Municipal and corporate bond prices also rose. Nevertheless, bond prices still are far below where they were only about five weeks ago. Some long-term Treasury issues, for example, still are more than nine points lower than they were March 26, and their yield is about seven-eighths of a percentage point higher.    Interest rates fell sharply yesterday on short-term Treasury bills. For example, the latest three-month Treasury bill rate dropped a quarter of a percentage point to 5.39% bid from 5.64% Wednesday. But the federal funds rate rose sharply.    The bond surge began early in the day but quickly picked up steam after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker told a House subcommittee that the Fed has tightened credit conditions slightly in recent days. Although many analysts already had reached the same conclusion in the past few weeks, Mr. Volcker's unusually unambiguous and strongly worded remarks underscored the Fed's determination to support the dollar.    To emphasize his point further, Mr. Volcker, speaking with reporters, said he &quot;absolutely and fundamentally&quot; believes the dollar shouldn't fall further. &quot;Cross my heart, hope to die,&quot; Mr. Volcker added, alluding to some analysts' worries that the Fed wouldn't back up its intentions with action.    &quot;Any uncertainty surrounding whether or not the Fed was going to take steps to defend the dollar was removed&quot; by Mr. Volcker's comments, said W. Lee Hoskins, a senior vice president at Pittsburgh's PNC Financial Corp. He said Mr. Volcker's statement was &quot;very good news&quot; because the Fed &quot;had created a great deal of uncertainty about how willing it was to take concrete action to stabilize the dollar.&quot;    The bond rally accelerated further after Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told President Reagan he has ordered Japan's Finance Ministry and central bank to cut short-term interest rates. He didn't specify how big the cut might be or what rates would be reduced, but he said the process already has begun.    Joint action by the U.S. and Japan was especially encouraging, many analysts agreed. They reasoned that the coordinated moves allowed each country to take smaller steps than would have been necessary if only one nation had acted. &quot;Either one would help, but both together are powerful,&quot; said Alan Reynolds, chief economist of Polyconomics Inc., a Morristown, N.J., consulting firm.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds registered its largest increase since June 6 of last year. The index jumped 28.50 points to close at 1312.42. It ranged between 1294.15 and 1322.24.    Nevertheless, some analysts fear that even the combined efforts of the Fed and Japan may prove inadequate to bolster the dollar for long. Despite the U.S.-Japan joint initiative, &quot;The direction of the dollar still is down,&quot; said Keith B. Jarrett, vice president of Technical Data International Inc., a Boston financial advisory firm. &quot;Until there is some substantive improvement in the (U.S.) balance of trade, there is going to be downward pressure on the dollar,&quot; he said.    In spite of yesterday's explosive bond rally, Mr. Jarrett also expects sharply higher interest rates in coming months. He predicted that long-term Treasury bond yields will surge in the next three or four months as much as 1 1/2 percentage points to the 9 1/2% to 10% range.    If the dollar reverses field and starts falling again, the Federal Reserve may be forced to take bolder steps. Some analysts predict the Fed will raise its discount rate at least half a percentage point and possibly even three-quarters of a percentage point. The discount rate, which is the fee charged by the Fed on loans to banks and savings institutions, stands at 5 1/2%.    Mr. Volcker yesterday refused to comment on whether the Fed might raise its discount rate. However, U.S. and Japanese officials said that neither the Fed nor the Bank of Japan was expected to change its discount rate.    The dollar's rapid descent earlier this year alarmed Fed officials and many investment managers. They feared the lower dollar would lead to higher inflation as prices rose on imported goods, which in turn would enable U.S. producers to raise prices more easily.    The dollar's weakness, coupled with widespread concern about a potential trade war between the U.S. and Japan, also ignited fear that Japanese investors would shun U.S. bonds. Some traders feared that Japanese institutions might even unload large amounts of bonds they already own.    Late yesterday, though, there were unconfirmed rumors that Japanese officials had quietly passed the word to Japanese institutions to buy aggressively at next week's Treasury auctions.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 soared yesterday to a price of 90 1/32 from 87 15/32 Wednesday. It traded as high as 90 20/32 and as low as 88 10/32. The yield fell to 8.42% from 8.68%.    The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 rose yesterday to 93 29/32 from 92 3/32, while the yield fell to 8.18% from 8.47%.    Among short-term rates, the federal funds rate rose especially sharply, averaging 7.86%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. The rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other, averaged 6.87% Wednesday, 6.75% Tuesday and 6.57% Monday.    Bankers Trust Co., citing the higher funds rate, boosted its broker-loan rate again, this time to 8 3/4% from 7 3/4%. The broker-loan rate is the rate that banks charge on loans backed by stock.    Nevertheless, Treasury bill rates tumbled. The rate on the latest six-month Treasury bills fell to 5.86% from 6.12%.    In the corporate debt market, a $200 million issue of General Motors Acceptance Corp. notes was offered to investors through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The notes have a final maturity of May 1, 1997, but investors have the right to redeem the notes at par May 1, 1992. The 8 3/8% notes were priced yesterday at par. They are rated double-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Separately, Marriott Corp. offered $100 million of 10-year notes to investors. The 8 7/8% notes were priced at 99.809 to yield 8.89%, according to Merrill Lynch. The issue is rated single-A-3 by Moody's and single-A-minus by Sandamp;P.    The Federal Reserve reported an exceptionally large $14.8 billion surge in the nation's basic money supply for the week ended April 20. But the news had little effect on the credit markets because it had been widely anticipated and because most analysts assume it was caused by technical factors relating to the April 15 tax date. The M1 measure consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public.    The Fed said the M1 measure jumped to a seasonally adjusted average of $757 billion from $742.2 billion the previous week. During the latest 13 weeks, the M1 measure averaged $739.7 billion, which represents a 9.1% annual rate of increase from the like period 13 weeks earlier. The Fed doesn't have a target for M1 growth this year.    (See related story: &quot;Fed's Tightening of Credit, Nakasone's Vow to Act Signal New Coordination&quot; -- WSJ May 1, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
