Rotondo, chief corporate dealer at Security Pacific International Bank in New York.    Richard Witten, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. in New York, also thinks the U.S. currency has further to fall, although he says he &quot;wouldn't be surprised to see some Japanese officials try to talk the dollar up again a bit . . . to 144 (yen)&quot; this week.    Specific prognoses aside, analysts say the dollar's decline from Aug. 14 to Aug. 21 -- in which the currency also fell more than 4% against the mark -- challenges the resolve of industrial nations to maintain smooth, orderly markets, presages an even more volatile September and throws into doubt the Reagan administration's policy of using a weaker dollar to correct the staggering U.S. trade deficit and stall protectionist legislation in Congress.    And some analysts say that the major industrial countries may have to rethink the 140-to-155 yen and 1.75-to-1.9 mark ranges that many believe they agreed to defend at a meeting in February at the Louvre in Paris.    Following a more than six-week advance, the dollar's latest descent began Aug. 14 after the Commerce Department reported that the June U.S. trade deficit was $15.71 billion, far wider than market expectations.    &quot;Those who were bullish on the dollar because they believed the trade deficit would come down have been shot to ribbons,&quot; says Geoffrey E.J. Dennis, an international economist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London.    Last week &quot;was a bloodbath in (West) Germany and other countries because of the belief that the dollar wouldn't collapse below 1.8550 marks,&quot; says Manfred Kunert, a general manager at DG Bank in Frankfurt.    On Friday, the currency plunged another 1.7% against the yen and a little more than 1% against the mark after the release of poor U.S. economic growth figures and reports of remarks by Japan's finance minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, that surprised traders interpreted as a signal that Tokyo wouldn't forcefully intervene to stem the dollar's slide.    In a new estimate, the Commerce Department said the gross national product -- the nation's total output of goods and services -- expanded in the second quarter at an annual rate of 2.3%, less than the department's previous estimate of 2.6% and market expectations.    Earlier Friday, in Tokyo, Mr. Miyazawa told a press gathering that the so-called Louvre currency ranges were &quot;very vague&quot; and that the dollar's latest fall against the yen wouldn't seriously affect the Japanese economy or business.    In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at 1.8145 marks and 142.23 yen, down from 1.8350 marks and 144.70 yen Thursday. The British pound rose to $1.6325 from $1.6160 a day earlier.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 141.25 yen, down almost a full yen from late Friday.    But August wasn't supposed to be like this.    Usually it is a time when trading is presumed to be listless, dealers stock up on dirty jokes, markets are thin and senior traders take vacation.    &quot;This is supposed to be a really dead month,&quot; Mr. Rotondo says. But, he says, the combination of poor U.S. trade and growth figures &quot;have really punched us out of the mood.&quot;    Sentiment about the dollar is decidely bearish.    &quot;The fundametals still are against the dollar,&quot; says Philippe D'Arvisenet, deputy chief economist at Banque Nationale de Paris in Paris. &quot;As long as there's no significant improvement in the (U.S.) trade deficit -- and consequently the current account -- we will see a declining dollar, maybe with temporary rises as we have seen with the tension in the Middle East.&quot;    Mr. Dennis of James Capel says &quot;there's a quite serious risk the U.S. administration will start to talk the dollar down again&quot; to placate a protectionist-bent Congress, even though U.S. industry is competitive at current exchange rates.    &quot;I fear the only way for the U.S. to solve this problem is to have a recession,&quot; thereby cutting off imports, he says.    However, almost all analysts expect the administration to do everything possible to avoid a recession, particularly with the presidential election countdown starting.    If the U.S. economy grows 2.6% this year, as many expect, it will have grown an average of 3.8% -- adjusted for inflation -- since the end of 1982, Mr. Dennis says. By comparison, West Germany's economy has grown at a 2.3% rate.    &quot;The problem is,&quot; the London economist says, &quot;the underlying growth rate of the U.S. economy is too strong relative to the rest of the industrial world,&quot; leaving the U.S. &quot;sucking in imports.&quot;    Even so, says David F. Lomax, group economic adviser at National Westminster Bank in London, &quot;Adjustment is happening.&quot;    The Japanese and German economies are adjusting to the those countries' stronger currencies, Mr. Lomax says, and Japan has adopted a large program to stimulate its domestic economy.    Adjustment for the U.S. will take more time, he says. One reason is that &quot;exports, which used to come from Japan and Germany, now come from South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil,&quot; which have weaker currencies, says Mr. Lomax.    Regardless, many analysts predict the dollar will fall an additional 5% to 10%, either by year end or early 1988.    If figures for the July U.S. trade deficit -- to be released in early September -- fail to show much improvement over the disappointing figures for June and May, says Shigeru Tokunaga, foreign-exchange manager at Fuji Bank in New York, the dollar will plummet to historic lows -- below 1.70 marks and 137 yen.    Meanwhile, many traders are puzzled about the absence of central bank fortitude during the dollar's decline last week.    The Bank of Japan intervened -- selling yen for dollars -- with only token amounts; the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, was noticeably absent, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York even injected liquidity into U.S. domestic markets, indicating to some economists a lack of concern about the impact of the dollar's fall.    Mr. Tokunaga believes Tokyo is trying to damp protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress by not forcefully resisting the dollar's fall.    Analysts also point to the concern of foreign central banks that the fast pace of their local monetary growth, which currently is above targets in Germany and Britain and exceeds projections in Japan, will lead to accelerated inflation. Japan's broad measure of money supply, for example, grew 10.3% in July from a year earlier, says Nicholas P. Sargen, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.    &quot;A steady or slightly appreciated yen helps to eradicate some of the inflation worries&quot; in Japan, Mr. Sargen says.    Moreover, Japan's Economic Planning Agency reported Friday that the country's economy is recovering from the effects of the stronger yen, that investment in plant and equipment is picking up and that Japanese companies have exhibited a remarkable ability to adjust to a mightier yen.    &quot;The Japanese bond market experienced its biggest sell-off in this decade when the yen was weakening,&quot; a few weeks ago, Mr. Sargen says. For three weeks in a row, Japan's Ministry of Finance was forced to postpone its first 20-year bond auction, which it now has scheduled for September.    However, with the Japanese currency appreciating this week, Mr. Sargen says, the local government bond market rallied 0.42%.    Japan's need to issue two trillion yen ($14 billion) of 20-year bonds by March and refinance two trillion to three trillion yen of maturing 10-year bonds in November creates an incentive for the finance ministry to promote a stable domestic bond market, he says.    Nonetheless, if the dollar falls to around 1.78 marks and 140 yen, &quot;the markets will look for the central banks to come in in force,&quot; says Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Phillips andamp; Drew, a London-based unit of the Union Bank of Switzerland.    Currency traders &quot;will back away,&quot; he says. &quot;They won't want to take on the central banks again.&quot;    Still, Mr. Lewis says, the June U.S. &quot;trade figures shocked not only markets but official circles&quot; as well. And that, he says, &quot;may be leading to some reassessment (of whether) the ranges agreed to at the Louvre are viable.&quot;    Salomon Brothers' Mr. Sargen, for one, believes central banks may have to adopt a system of adjustable ranges for the yen and mark, if only to avoid exacerbating growth in domestic money supplies by constantly intervening to defend the dollar.    The U.S. and other nations would be mistaken to resist too strenuously the dollar's decline, says Mr. Lomax of National Westminster Bank, &quot;because it would cause a recession,&quot; which he describes as the worst possible outcome for next year.    Despite the consensus, not everyone is a dollar doomsdayer. Conceding that the market isn't as buoyant as it was a month ago, Aloys Bischofberger, chief economist at Credit Suisse in Zurich, says it is &quot;just more realistic. The exaggerated expectations are disappearing.&quot;    Mr. Bischofberger predicts that the U.S. currency will be relatively stable until year end because U.S. economic growth will outpace that of many other countries and because dollar-denominated interest rates will be higher relative to other currencies -- something that often enhances a currency's appeal to investors.
