Trimble, a maker of &quot;positioning&quot; devices for military andcivilian vehicles, is on target to realize more than adoubling of revenue, and fivefold profit growth, for 1991,Charles R. Trimble, chairman, president and chief executive,said in an interview. The gains will come despite an expecteddecline in fourth-quarter profit following a short-livedwindfall from military product sales during the Gulf War.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts are close to the mark in forecastingfourth-quarter profit of about $700,000, or four cents ashare, on revenue of $35 million, Mr. Trimble said. A yearearlier, the company had net income of $1.4 million, or ninecents a share, on revenue of $24.1 million.   For all 1991, profit will be nearly $12 million, or 69cents a share, on revenue of $155 million to $158 million. In1990, Trimble posted profit of $2.2 million, or 14 cents ashare, on revenue of $63.3 million.   Analysts have feared that Japanese companies which excelat miniaturized electronics would soon come out with acheaper version of Trimble's positioning devices, andaggressively expand their uses in commercial applications,such as the car and boat markets, at Trimble's expense. SonyCorp. of America, the U.S. unit of Sony Corp. of Japan,recently introduced a consumer-oriented positioning device,called the Pyxis, priced at $1,395. Like all such devices, ituses signals from satellites operated by the DefenseDepartment to plot the user's position.   &quot;Sony obviously represents competition to be takenseriously,&quot; Mr. Trimble said. But he said Sony's Pyxisproduct, targeted at recreational boaters, seemed more of a&quot;market research tool&quot; to test the waters, rather than a&quot;high-end consumer product.&quot; He called the Sony deviceinferior to a recreational model offered by Trimble thatsells for about $1,500 at retail. &quot;We believe we have a morerugged product, with far longer battery-life,&quot; he said. &quot;Andit's field-proven, in terms of its military applications.&quot;   Trimble, which announced price cuts earlier this year,plans no defensive discounting in response to Sony's debut.Rather, Mr. Trimble says the company will unveil four newproducts in the fourth quarter, plus 30% annual discounts onolder electronics hardware. (Prices of older electronicsproducts typically fall by that amount each year.) Hedeclined to provide details of new product features.   Mr. Trimble said Sony's new product is aimed at the bottom10% of Trimble's product line, a low-end consumer segment forwhich he contends there is little demand so far. Trimble'sstrategy is to concentrate on its high-end products until areal consumer appetite develops. &quot;In many ways, this Sonyintroduction is healthy,&quot; he said. &quot;They're legitimizing themarket.&quot;   Currently, Trimble's aviation product line includes sixdevices priced from $1,700 to $60,000. Its marine productsinclude five devices ranging from $1,500 to $15,000. Surveyand mapping products for positioning on land range from$4,000 to $50,000. And its systems division includes devicesranging from $600 to multimillion dollar systems.   Aside from the end of the Desert Storm windfall, Mr.Trimble said the major reason for Trimble's modestfourth-quarter profit is its decision to invest heavily inresearch and development. This, rather than short-termmarketing moves, is the best way to counter futurecompetition, Mr. Trimble said.</TEXT></DOC>
