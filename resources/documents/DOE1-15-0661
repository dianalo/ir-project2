The goal of the work has beento demonstrate the feasibility of a solid state lithium battery employingintercalation electrodes and having a specific energy density higherthan 100 Wh/kg for a 3 hour discharge. The research has been dividedinto three main areas: 1) Materials research. The emphasis has been oninvestigating new intercalation materials for positive electrodes andon crystalline electrolytes. 2) Mathematical modeling of electrochemicalcells. Both analytical and simulation methods have been used for understandingand planning experiments and to suggest cell designs. 3) Cycling experiments.A number of test cells have been subjected to long term cycling in orderto test the reversibility and transport properties of solid state cells.The material parameters most relevant to battery performance - e.g. thevariation of the electromotive force with lithium concentration, thediffusion of Li/sup +/ ions, the electronic conductivity - have beenmeasured for a number of intercalation compounds. Four types of electrolyteshave been used: Liquid organic solutions, polymer electrolytes, lithiumnitride and mixed phase electrolytes of the two latter. Simplified analyticalmodels describing the discharge of the intercalation electrode both inthe compact form and as part of a porous and a composite electrode havebeen developed. A large number of long term cycling experiments on solidstate cells have been performed. (EG).</TEXT></DOC>
