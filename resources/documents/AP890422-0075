VENEZIA</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Donald Trump is playing a real-lifegame of Monopoly with Atlantic City real estate these days.   In less than a month, the developer has announced two propertydeals that would put him in command of a lucrative five-block areain the center of the Boardwalk.   New Jersey regulatory authorities say they will look closely atthe implications of the deal in deciding whether to approve it.   The financial genius of the deal is that the two acquisitionswould be taken off the rolls as casinos and converted into luxuryhotels to comply with state law, thus enhancing the market sharefor the gambling spots Trump already owns.   New Jersey law has a three-casino limit per owner. Trump alreadyowns Trump Plaza, Trump Castle and the soon-to-be-opened Taj Mahal.   Converting Elsinore's Atlantis Casino Hotel and the formerPenthouse casino site into hotels would benefit the gaming hall inthe middle, Trump Plaza, said Marvin B. Roffman, an analyst withthe investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.   ``When you take a casino site off the market, the people sharingthe pie will share bigger pieces,'' he said. ``Donald Trump tookthe most important five blocks in Atlantic City _ where Caesarsbegins and Atlantis ends. Four properties were going to share thatspace and now there's only going to be two.''   Trump's Atlantis purchase is subject to regulatory approval. Thefinancially ailing casino is controlled by a state-appointedconservator.   ``There's a good deal of concern over anyone who amasses toomuch of the real estate among the casino-zoned properties,'' saidAnthony Parrillo, director of the state Division of GamingEnforcement. ``The public policy of this state is to fostercompetition in the Atlantic City marketplace, and the public policyis against undue economic concentration.   ``The question it boils down to is with all the incrementalholdings of Mr. Trump _ or anyone, for that matter _ when is enoughenough?'' Parrillo said. ``That's a very difficult issue to assessbecause the Legislature didn't give a precise formula other thanthe three-license rule.''   At the same time, regulators must consider the prerogative of anentrepreneur to enter into such agreements, as well as the best usefor the property and what the local market is able to handle, hesaid.   The Casino Control Act, Parrillo said, ``wants a healthy mix ofcompetitors _ diversified and multi-dimensional.''   Martin Danzinger, a former member of the Casino ControlCommission, said the issue is whether Trump has become powerfulenough ``to become a government of his own.''   ``Among casino employees, he will control 20 percent of theindustry,'' Danziger said. ``If for some reason the state had toclose him up, what impact would that have on the industry? And howmuch impact would it have if he decides to walk away from thegaming tables? The state should be debating those questions _ andthey probably are.''   Roffman said Trump's purchase of the Atlantis for ``a bargainprice'' of $63 million; Trump bought the former Penthouse site for$56 million.   If both deals are completed, ``Trump will control almost a mileof Boardwalk frontage,'' Roffman said. ``That's very powerful.''</TEXT></DOC>
