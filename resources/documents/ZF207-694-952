 A$5 million company taking over one of the oldest, most successful suppliersin the industry, one which was more than 20 times its size?andM;But after the initial shock, the acquisition seemed to make a lot of sense.andO;Tegra, which had been founded with venture capital, had been successful inraising cash.andP;  Varityper, in spite of its century of relative success, hadbeen through more than one period of financial difficulty in recent years,partly because of the troubles of its parent company, AM international.andP;  Itneeded to find a stable owner and a stable situation in which it couldconcentrate on products and markets, not finances.andM;It also was true that AM International's interest in the prepress businesswas waning as it focused on presses and other printing equipment.andM;Perhaps more important, in Tegra's few years of existence, it had developedinnovative, capable products, but its lack of a familiar name and marketingprowess hampered it in its competition with companies such as Autologic andCompugraphic.andP;  Varityper had one of the best-known names in the industry anda strong marketing and sales team, plus good distribution channels.andM;Thus, the acquisition seemed to fit well.andM;Not inconsequentially, Varityper was available for a price Tegra could affordeasily.andP;  As we understand the situation, Tegra paid $40 million in cash andassumed liabilities valued at about $20 million in exchange for Varityper,which at the time had annual sales of about $115 million overall.andM;That isn't meant to imply that Tegra put one over on AM International.andP;  AMarranged a means of continuing to get revenues from Varityper by retainingexclusive rights to sell the Varityper products in all markets outside theU.S.andP;  for the next five years.andP;  It also gained nonexclusive rights to sellTegra products in the same areas.andP;  That plan was received favorably by Tegrabecause it hadn't established a strong presence outside the U.S.andP;  and waslooking for assistance there.andM;One other concern that was expressed at the time of the acquisition was howthe new company would reconcile the long line of output devices under thcsame umbrella.andP;  Not only were there the Tegra machines emulating Linotype andCompugraphic devices, with PostScript under development, but there were theVarityper imagesetters operating in Chelgraph's Ace language, also withPostScript soon to come.andP;  It seemed as if some thinning of the ranks would benecessary.andM;A year after the announcement of the acquisition, the deal appears to bepaying off for the new, combined company, which is forecasting revenues forthis year of approximately double Tegra's consolidated revenues for thcprevious year.andP;  No trimming of output device lines has been done.andP;  Nor is itplanned.andP;  To the contrary, both lines are in the process of being expanded toprovide even more flexibility than previously.andM;Changing character.andP;  That leads to another point of considerablesignificance: Varityper's long history as a supplier of low- cost typesettingsystems to the small user is changing.andP;  The combined Tegra/Varityperoperation is already forging a reputation for itself primarily as a supplierof output devices, rather than complete systems, and it has pushed its way upmarket to a point where it is a mid-range supplier, not serving the peoplewho want a typesetter for $20,000 or a low-end composition system.andM;History of the two companiesandM;Before we focus on the combined company, we'll provide a little background onthe two companies prior to the acquisition.andM;Tegra, the youngster in the output game.andP;  Tegra was founded in 1984 by WardBaxter, former vice president of engineering at Atex, and Tom Fay, alsopreviously with Atex.andP;  They had the backing of a venture capital groupcomprising Paine-Webber, Memorial Drive Trust, Fairfield Venture Capital andthe venture arm of John Hancock.andP;  Initial capital of about $2 million wasincreased to more than $7 million in a second round of financing in thesummer of 1985, involving the same four firms plus American Research andDevelopment.andM;As founders, Fay and Baxter stayed with the company until 1987 and 1988,respectively, but not all that time as the company's top administrators.andO;Skip Klemm, formerly of Compugraphic, was brought in as president in thespring of 1987, reflecting the investors' views that more professionaladministration was needed.andP;  But Klemm lasted only a few months, replaced byBob Trenkamp, formerly of Varityper and Linotype (more about Trenkamp later).andM;Tegra started with one product: the Genesis plain-paper printer, notedprimarily for its fast RIP and the fact that it achieved higher resolution ona Canon print engine than anyone else.andP;  The original Genesis drove a CanonLBP-5/480 at a resolution of 1012 x 506 dpi, rather than the typical 400 dpi.andO;The added resolution was accomplished by getting Canon to adjust the verticaldot placement to 506 dots per inch, while Tegra turned down the power of thelaser to produce a smaller dot and to output 1012 dots horizontally.andM;Tegra also had an interesting approach to fonts.andP;  For people planning to usethe machine for final output, Genesis had access to native fonts fromBitstream that were produced using their true proportions.andP;  For people usingthe machine as a proof printer, gencric faces were scaled in height and widthto match the proportions of faces being emulated.andP;  The initial machineemulated the Linotron 202; later, emulation of the Compugraphic 8600 and 8400was added.andM;The machine's speed was notable.andP;  It took 12 seconds to output an 8.5&quot;x 11&quot;page, including processing time.andP;  The Tegra RIP used a Motorola 68000 andbit-slice processors to achieve its high speed.andP;  Other specifications of themachine included sizing from 4.5 points to 127 points, rotation in 90-degreeincrements, and condensing and expanding of type.andP;  It sold for $36,000-expensive for a proofer, most people said, but reasonable for afinal-output machine.andM;Over the years, key additions to the product have brought Tegra into thethick of the typesetter market.andP;  Support for the ECRM PelBox in 1985 enabledthe company to provide highresolution output on photographic materials.andP;  TheCanon LBP/ 20 was added in 1986 to provide 11&quot; x 17&quot; plain-paper output.andO;Until 1987, Tegra didn't support output of graphics, but when thisshortcoming was alleviated, the machine became competitive with othergraphics imagesetters.andP;  Also added was a configuration using the 108-picaPetBox.andM;Varityper: veteran serving the little guy.andP;  Depending on how old one is, theVarityper name means different things.andP;  It goes back more than a century tosupplying typewriters.andP;  More recently (in the 1950s and beyond), the companyhas been known for its headline machines and a line of typesetters (707, 744,747, 748), prior to filling a key role in the development of the direct-inputtypesetter in the 1970s.andP;  Providing input and output units in the samemachine, the direct-input Comp/Set 500 triggered a war between Varityper andCompugraphic for allegiance at the low end of the market.andM;With each of the two companies seUing of thousands of machincs annually, thismarket segment became one of the important ones in the computer publishingfield.andP;  It stimulated a lot of the technological advances in editing andcomposition systems and it gave the small shops a means of producing typethat wouldn't have been possible otherwise.andM;The battle kept raging as the two sides traded jabs: the Varityper Comp/Setwas followed by thc CG EditWriter, the Varityper Comp/Edit, the CG MCS, theVarityper Epics system, the CG PowerView, and so on.andM;Through most of this time, Varityper's output devices were used strictly astypesetters for their integrated composition workstations.andP;  That is, theComp/Sets and Comp/Edits each came complete with a termninal and typesetter.andO;Even when the Epics commercial system was introduced, it drove only Varitypertypesetters, providing what was probably the least expensive multiterminaltypesetting system on the market at the time.andP;  Thus, the company's reputationwas justandM;Varityper, a Tegra company With the merger, things have changed for bothcompanies.andP;  AH of their activities have been merged into one organization,Tegra, Inc., headed by Bob Trenkamp, president and chief executive officer.andO;However, all day-to-day operations take place undcr the Varityper banner,which is upheld by Ed Hale, president.andP;  Trenkamp and Hale had worked togetherpreviously at Varityper and bring a lot of experience and talent to theirrespective jobs.andM;Most of the operation is centered in the large Varityper facility in EastHanover, New Jersey.andP;  This handles all sales and marketing activity, plussome of the engineering efforts.andP;  The only activity currently taking place atthe former Tegra building in Billerica, Massachusetts, is a developmentcenter related to the Tegra line of output devices.andM;Trenkamp had served successively as vice president of sales and marketing,president, and group vice president in charge of the Varityper division latein the 1970s.andP;  After his departure from Varityper in 1981, he left theindustry to serve as president of KCR Technology, a developer of high-speedelectronic printers.andP;  He returned in 1983 as president of Linotype's U.S.andO;operation, which was soon to plunge into the fourth wave with PC andMacintosh software packages driving PostScript typesetters.andP;  He left Linotypein 1986 and again disappeared from the scene to spend a year as president ofLloyd Harbor Resources, a company involved with turnarounds, this time toreappear as president and CEO of Tegra in the summer of 1987.andM;Hale had been president of Varityper at the time it developed the Comp/Setand Comp/Edit single-user typesetting systems, prior to being promoted togroup vice president at AM Information Systems, an AM unit responsible forVarityper and its word processors and business computers.andP;  (Ironically,Trenkamp succeeded him as president of Varityper.)andM;All together, Hale has spent 27 years with AM.andP;  He left Varityper in 1979 tojoin Sun Electric for three years as executive vice president before movingto Royal Business Machines for three years as president.andP;  He then went toPertec Computer for two years and Scan Optics for one year before returningto Varityper last year.andM;Organization.andP;  Under Hale are seven units, each headed by a vice president:andM;* Finance, headed by Jim Marlow, chief financial officer,andM;who came from Xerox in January this year.andM;* Sales and marketing, under Pat Juliano, who earlier spentandM;two terms totaling seven years with Compugraphic and also worked at Linotypeduring Trenkamp's tenure.andP;  Under Juliano are Jay Eisenberg, vice president ofmarketing, and Bob Donellan, in charge of special markets (nationalaccounts', government education and alternate distribution).andP;  Eisenberg hasbeen with Varityper for more than two years, having come from ConcurrentComputer, where he worked in product management.andM;* Customer service, with Ron Smith at the helm.andP;  Smith is inandM;his third stint with AM and associated companies, of which two have been withVarityper.andP;  He also worked for Genigraphics.andM;* Product management and planning, headed by KevinandM;Sroub, who started with AM international in the 1960s and joined TandM;egra in 1988.andP;        *andM;Research, development and engineering, which is dividedandM;into two parts, both under Mike Smutek: the engineering facility in EastHanover and the development center in Massachusetts.andP;  Smutek had been incharge of Randamp;D at Tegra prior to the acquisition.andP;  Earlier, he worked for Wangand as director of engineering at ECRM when it was part of AM International.andM;* Manufacturing, also run entirely at the East Hanover site,andM;headed by Bill Harvey, who joined Tegra(Varityper last month fromCompugraphic, where he was group plant manager.andM;* Type and supplies, under Bill Brine, a 12-year VarityperandM;veteran.andM;Another vice president on the staff is long-term employee George Pick,responsible for advanced development.andM;Trenkamp says that these appointments represent the staff he would like tohave running the company.andP;  He doesn't expect any further changes in thecoming months.andP;  Similarly, the distribution of responsibilities betweenBillerica and East Hanover is set.andM;A national overviewandM;The two companies' sales, marketing, service and support organizations havebeen merged at the East Hanover headquarters, with the U.S.andP;  area dividedinto four regions: northeast (handled from Billerica), central (out ofChicago), south (Atlanta) and west (Los Angeles).andP;  Each region has fivedistricts (except the northeast, which has six), headed by district managers.andO;A total of about 1,250 people are employed nationwide, a decrease from thefigure of 1,400 more than a year ago.andP;  (We were told that most of them werelet go before the merger.)andM;The sales force, totaling 115 people, is divided among die 21 districts, witha system specialist in each district to serve as a liaison with East Hanover,primarily to handle the Epics composition system and the Tegra product line.andM;Educational service and support representatives have been trained todemonstrate systems in support of the sales force.andP;  They assist withinstallation, initial training on site and ongoing training through 14classrooms around the country.andM;Field service is provided by a force of 250 field engineers.andP;  Another group,responsible for application testing, has representation in both East Hanoverand Billerica.andP;  These people, who report to the product managementdepartment, handle beta testing, user documentation and support for the fieldorganization.andM;International operation.andP;  As we indicated earlier, AM international hasexclusive rights to the Varityper line everywhere outside thc U.S.andP;  andnonexclusive rights to the Tegra line in the same areas.andP;  Doug Hay, formerlyof Compugraphic, is employed by AM to oversee this operation.andP;  John Howardperforms a similar role for Varityper.andM;Tegra's Line: The Key Is the Image ControllerandM;The original Genesis, based on the Tegra Image Controller (TIC), has evolvedinto a full line of products using the same controller, which has beenenhanced over the years to provide greater functionality.andP;  The product line'snaming scheme that was in effect until recently was based on the capabilitiesof the machines.andP;  XP indicated a plain-paper machine, while XM stood for anECRM PetBox.andM;As of the ANPA show this June, the product line has been given a newnumbering scheme: the 5000 series, which follows the conventions establishedwith the Varityper 4000 series numbersandM;Although it makes sense to have the family using a common initial number, wefind some of the changes to have added to the confusion rather than reducedit.andP;  For example, why do the plain-paper machines havc names that identifytheir resolution, while the PelBox versions don't reflect size, speed oranything else we can think of? And why is the name of the new plain-papermachinc (5510) nearly identical to the name of the 108-pica PelBox (5500)?andM;The only thing we can think of is that the names are part of a grand schemethat includes future products that may make it all more sensible.andM;We also are confused by the fact that some of these names are the same as orclose to those of former Varityper machines (e.g., the Comp/Edit 5510).andP;  Mostpeople probably won't find that a problem, though.andM;The Image ControllerandM;The key to Tegra's past and future success is its Image Controller, acombination of hardware and software optimized for speed and enhanced overthe years to support a great variety of input alternatives, recorders andcapabilities.andP;  Incorporating Motorola 68020 and 68000 CPUs with bit-sliceprocessors, it uses pipelining to rasterize data on the fly to drive arecorder at its full rated speed.andP;  Unlike most other imagesetters (but likeChelgraph) ,it doesn't require the recorder to stop and start (as is donewith the Linotype, Compugraphic and Ultre machines) and it doesn't requircbuilding an entire page in memory prior to imaging (as is done by Autologic)to prevent the recorder from getting ahead of the RIP.andP;  The one exception tothis is the PostScript version, which uses 16 MB of memory to build a pagebit map before starting to record.andM;The TIC consists of several distinct parts:andM;* Emulator.andP;  The emulator module can accommodate multiple input commandlanguages within the same TIC.andP;  Among the possibilities arc Linotype Cora,Compugraphic 8600, Compugraphic 8400, Compugraphic SDLC, Hewlett-Packard PCLand PostScript, which is handled through an interpreter developed inconjunction with Custom Applications, Inc.andP;  (see below).andP;  In any of thesecases except PostScript, the input command language is converted to Tegra'sinternal language and sent to the next module.andM;* Font database.andP;  Fonts reside in outline form in a single database that isaccessed for any of the emulations.andP;  For native Tegra output, the standardTegra fonts are used.andP;  These include the full Bitstream library of more than1,000 faces and additional faces from Varityper, ITC and other sources.andP;  Whenthe TIC is emulating another system, such as a 202, the Tegra fonts aremodified to match the proportions of Linotype fonts through the applicationof sophisticated rules, For example, not only are thc widths modified tomatch the widths of 202 fonts, but side bearings, x-height, cap height andother factors arc taken into consideration, sometimes on acharacter-by-charactcr basis, sometimes for an entire font.andM;A basic font has 129 characters, but the user can build fonts that are muchlarger by taking characters from other fonts, adding special characters,building fractions, etc.andP;  * Typeset.andP;  After commands from the front end havebeen converted to Tegra coding, typographic features are implemented: sizingof type, expanding and condensing of characters, and so on.andP;  * Imager.andP;  Thenext step is building the display list for the job.andP;  Up to this point, thesystem is both device- and resolutionindependent.andP;  * Image generator.andO;Rasterizing of graphics, rotation of elements and sending raster data to therecording engines take place in die image generator, which is equipped withbitslice processors and is microcoded for speed.andP;  As we said earlier, itcreates bit maps on the fly to drive the recorders without stopping andstarting.andP;  The only exception to this practice is that when PostScript isbeing handled, page bit maps are rasterized to memory prior to recording.andP;  *andO;Recording engines.andP;  Each TIC can drive one plain-paper and onephotographic-material print engine from the available machines.andP;  Thosecurrently offered include the Canon LBP-20, SX and DX for plain paper and theECRM PelBox for 72-pica and 108 -pica photographic material.andP;  We presume thatthe new, 3000-dpi PelBox wiH be supported, but Tegra hasn't announced thisyet.andM;This data flow enables multiple pages or jobs to be processed concurrently,such as conversion of data for one job by the emulator while the previous jobis being rasterized and an earlier one is being imaged.andP;  Jobs can be sentalternately to either recorder.andM;The TIC plugs into a front-end system just as any other typesetter would, orit can be run remotely.andM;Optional imaging features.andP;  Tegra offers some optional imaging features, manyof which aren't supported on traditional nonraster typcsetters, in a packagecalled Advanced Typography Plus, which sells for $1,995 in the U.S.andP;  Itenables generation of tints, 100 different patterns (each in any percentagetint), area reverses, rotation of text in one-degree increments, enlargementand reduction of jobs, and round-cornered boxes.andP;  Thus, Tegra, emulating amachine such as the 202, is able to provide greater functionality than a usermay be getting from the 202.andM;In addition, the optional Graphics Subsystem, discussed below, can be used toenable text-only systems to merge graphics onto text pagcs.andM;Job control commands.andP;  The system supports a set of job control commands tospecify items such as page orientation, places to break galleys or columns,automatic generation of slug lines for output media, and multiple-copyoutput.andP;  These commands can be accessed in any of three ways, depending onthe capabilities of the front-end system.andP;  If the system doesn't supportembedded commands, system defaults can be edited and used or the LCD displayand keypad can be employed.andP;  Systems that support &quot;pass-through&quot; commands canspecify job control information to be passed through.andP;  Or a special font canbc created to carry job control data, as is done with the MCS with the newSDLC emulator.andM;Front-end systems that have taken advantage of these features include Atex,Bedford, Compugraphic MCS and Quadex, CCI, Dewar, Harris, Magna, Miles 33,Mycro-Tek, Penta, Texet and Xyvision.andM;PCL.andP;  The PCL emulator, announced at the Seybold Desktop PublishingConference in 1987 and released in 1988, has been selling well, Tegra says.andO;In June, it shipped PCL to 50 users, approximately one-third of which werenew customers buying Tegra systcms equipped with PCL, rather than existingcustomers merely adding the PCL emulation.andM;SDLC emulation.andP;  The newest emulator is one for the MCS.andP;  Previously Tegrawas able to emulate thc CG 8400, but the newest emulator enables a directconnection to an MCS system outputting its SDLC protocol.andP;  The user starts byloading width diskettes into the MCS front end to correspond to the Tegrafont widths (Bitstream).andP;  Job control features are handled by using a fontcall to type in the job control parameters (galley depth, portrait orlandscape orientation, etc.).andP;  With the Advanced Typography Plus package, theMCS can generate somr special effects that aren't supported on the 8400.andM;PCI: alternative to AdobeandM;The newest item available for the TIC is a PostScript emulator developed inconjunction with CAI, which also supplies PostScript &quot;clone&quot; interpreters toAgfa Compugraphic (for its CG Script), Optronics/Intergraph (for itsColorSetter 2000), Information International (to convert to 3800 V-bitgraphic format) and many vendors serving the desktop market, making it one ofthe few clone developers that has carved a significant position for itself inthe market.andM;The PostScript-Compatible Interpreter, as it is called, is ahardware/software package consisting of a 68020 processor, 16 MB of memory,an input/output board with an AppleTalk port and a control panel to bemounted on the back of the machine, plus the software interpreter.andP;  Unlikethe other emulators, thc PCI doesn't translate foreign input command codesinto the Tegra language.andP;  It uses thc CAI RIP to process the file andgenerate bands of bit-map data (using Tegra fonts, as we will explain below).andO;The Tegra module then takes the bands, compresses the data and stores it inmemory until an entire page has been rasterized and stored.andP;  The data for thepage is then decompressed as it is output to the recording engine.andP;  As soonas the page is given to the recorder, the PCI can begin processing the nextone in the same manner, thus saving time by overlapping the two tasks.andM;Fonts: Tegra's added value.andP;  There are a couple of interesting facets toTegra's handling of fonts.andP;  First, fonts are accessed from the same fontdatabase as the other emulators.andP;  When the PostScript processor needscharacters, it calls for them in the proper scaling factor and angle ofrotation.andP;  This function takes advantage of the fast font-generation hardwarethat Tegra already had built, using bit-slice processors as well as a 68020.andO;This may account in part for the results we found in our tests oftext-oriented jobs.andM;The other nice feature of the PCI font scheme is that it supports the Tegrafacility, for modifying fonts from the Tegra library to match the proportionsof Adobe faces.andP;  The PCI comes with Adobe-compatible faces to match thestandard 35 LaserWriter fonts, but also available are hundreds of Tegra fontsthat arc compatible with Adobe faces.andP;  Moreover, these fonts match Adobe'sfaces not only in width, but also in cap height, x-height, side bearings, andso on, using similar emulation algorithms to those used with Tegra's otheremulators.andP;  A total of 350 Adobc-compatible faccs are available now, withmore being added.andP;  Besides these, more than 1,000 faces from the Bitstreamlibrary are also offered with the PCI.andP;  These won't be compatible with newAdobe faces as they come outat least, not until Tegra releases anemulator-but they provide the PostScript user with a very large library offaces.andM;One more benefit-last but not least-of the Tegra package is that fonts necdto be purchased only once.andP;  The same font database is used for all emulators,including PostScript, so after purchasing one library, the only additionalcharge to support other emulators is a minimal fee for the medium on whichthe emulation algorithm is supplied.andP;  That should be good news to anycustomer requiring more than one set of fonts.andM;Speed.andP;  Tegra hasn't finished optimizing its program for speed, but it didcooperate with us in running speed tests in conjunction with an upcomingarticle comparing thc speeds of thc major players in thc high-resolutionPostScript output market.andP;  We will present thc detailed results in thatissue, but in the meantime, we can report that the PCI option tends to bcfaster than Varityper's Adobe-based PostScript machines on text-intensivejobs, particularly those with many font changes, but it is significantlyslower on heavy graphics jobs.andP;  Thc most extreme difference came on a textjob with 35 font changes, which was many times faster on thc Tegra PCI thanon a Varityper 420OB-P-not surprising in that Tegra's hardware was designedto bc fast and efficient in handling text.andP;  But on a job with a largehalftone, the 420OB-P took about one-third as long as thc Tegra PCI tooutput.andM;Tegra says its first priority in developing the PCI was to achievecompatibility, which it believes has been done.andP;  The next task will be tooptimize speed.andP;  A couple of upgrades scheduled for later this year willaddress speed issues, particularly in handling graphics.andM;Compatibility.andP;  Tegra says it has gone to extreme lengths to test itscompatibility.andP;  First, it subscribed to the Bauer suite of tests.andP;  Itfollowed that by soliciting &quot;problem&quot; jobs from customers over a period often months.andP;  We were told that more than a thousand of these jobs wercincluded in this testing and that, by thc conclusion, the PCI was able tohandle every Script file that it was givcn.andM;In our tcsting, we encountered no problems with compatibility.andP;  The onlyproblem we had was that the machine we used hadn't been equipped with thefull 16 MB and our &quot;killer&quot; graphics job caused it to run out of memory.andO;Tegra says that it has since run the job with full memory and was able tocomplete it.andM;Other advantages.andP;  In addition to the nice font situation (where thc cntireTegra library is available from the day the machinc is purchased and fontsneed to be purchased only once), Tegra points to a couple of other advantagesof its PCI over an Adobe systcm.andP;  One advantage is that die same Rip candrive multiple recorders, as opposed to the Adobe environment, in which thcuser typically buys a LaserWriter or clone as a plain-papcr proofing deviceand runs it separately from the high-rcsolution machine.andP;  (In this situation,the LaserWriter also requires its own set of fonts.) Tegra, of course,provides its usual family of recorders.andM;The other advantagc-not necessarily of much concern to most users-is thatTegra can drive recorders with nonsquare pixel output.andP;  That is, theresolution can be different in the two directions.andP;  In the case of machinesthat support greater resolution in onc dimension than in the other, thisability lets thc RIP take full advantage of the resolution available, asTegra does with the Canon engines (1012 x 5 06 and 800 x 400) .andM;Graphics SubsystemandM;Introduced in 1987, the Graphics Subsystem enables users to scan line art andphotographs on an ECRM Autokon 1000 or 2000 scanner, store them in a graphicsdatabase on the Image Controller, and merge them with text on output.andP;  Onekey benefit is that many text-only systems can be given the ability to outputgraphics on text pages through this system.andP;  Some of the text systems alreadyinterfaced are Quadex, Atex, CCI, Magna, Alphatype MultiSet, Datalogics,Mycro-Tek and Penta.andP;  Tegra says that virtually any system that outputs Coraor Compugraphic code can be supported.andM;Because graphics are stored as font characters, they can be manipulated inthe same ways as type.andP;  Among the capabilities are scaling, rotation,cropping, flopping, reversing, automatic generation of borders, screens andtints, and special text-ongraphics effects.andP;  Among the special effects for agraphic are dropout, overstrike, output and reversal, associated with normalor reverse text characters .andP;  Manipulation is accomplished by embedding Tegracommands in text files at the front-end system.andM;As many as 255 graphics can bc accessed for use on a single page.andM;Graphics are manipulated on the fly as they are output, with the originalsaved on disk.andP;  They can be stored on the same disk as system software.andM;The system supports input of graphics in uncompressed, compressedrun-length-encoded and compressed CCITT Group Ill or IV formats.andP;  Tegraestimates compression ratios at about 12 or 15 to 1 for line art (100:1 forsimple line art) and about 2 or 3 to 1 for halftones.andM;The Graphics Subsystem comprises a 20-MB hard disk (fixed or removable), atext terminal to control the database of images, graphics software and aninterface to the Autokon.andP;  Memory required for graphics storage is 4 MB for aplainpaper system, 7 MB for higher resolution.andP;  The maximum sizes of graphicsare 11&quot; x 17&quot; for fine art and logos, 8' x 10&quot; for an 85-line-screcnhalftone.andM;Handling PostScript graphics.andP;  The Graphics Subsystem currently can takenon-PostScript graphics and import them onto a page of PostScript data, butit can't yet do the opposite: take PostScript graphics and merge them withnon-PostScript data on a page.andP;  We presume, however, that this development isunder way.andM;The ability of the Graphics Subsystem to support the PCI emulator is beingadded this month.andM;Xerox scanner interfaceandM;A brand-new product developed by Tegra is an interface between the Xerox 7650scanner and the Macintosh.andP;  Called ImageScanner 1200, it provides directaccess to die interface from within Letraset's ImageStudio via the file menu,so it is possible to set up the scanner and rescan images without leavingImageStudio.andP;  (It also supports Silicon Beach's Digital Darkroom, but wedidn't get a chance to see a demonstration of that.)andM;ImageScanner 1200 includes some nice features for setting up the scanningoperation.andP;  The screen displays an area for specifying parameters and an areafor the image.andP;  One option is to preview the scan to determine which portionof the image is to be scanned again.andP;  When previewing, the systemautomatically scales the image to fit in the image area.andP;  The operator thenselects the area to be scanned by marking the opposite corners or by typingcropping parameters.andM;During the initial pass, the system optionally records the threshold levelfor use in adjusting the contrast.andP;  Most operations are convenient torun-selecting resolution, cropping dimensions, etc.andM;A few other features are:andM;* A &quot;revert&quot; function undoes aU operations since the previousandM;preview scan.andM;* It is possible to save the scanner setup parameters under a fileandM;name.andM;* Originals can be &quot;descreened&quot; by applying a filter, with theandM;option of selecting high, medium or low edge enhancement.andM;* Diagnostics are available to run a selftest of the scanner fromandM;within the Mac, in addition to running a test within die scanner.andM;* Within ImageStudio, it is possible to have the system selectandM;the appropriate scanning resolution to have the image fit within theImageStudio buffer.andM;Tegra/Varityper is selling ImageScanner 1200 in a package or as a standaloneproduct.andM;The new 5510andM;We reported on the new 5510 from ANPA last month, so we won't go into greatandamp;tail here.andP;  In summary, it is a largeformat, plain-paper machine based onthe Canon LBP-DX.andP;  A rollfed machine, it is specified by Canon as supportingoutput of pages up to 13 feet long, although Tegra/Varityper is selfing it asa 24&quot; x 36&quot; machine for PostScript files, or 24&quot;x 24&quot; for otheremulators-large enough to print a broadsheet newspaper page easily.andP;  Singlesheets can be fed in manually.andP;  Tegra will run it at a resolution of 1016 x508 dpi.andM;The speed is quoted as up to three 24&quot; x 36&quot; pages per minute or up to five18&quot; x 24' pages per minute.andP;  The duty cycle is 5,000 impressions per month,with a drum life of 400,000 prints.andM;Similar to other Canon machines, it is a write -black laser xerographicrecorder using dry toner.andP;  Toner is poured into a bin, not changed byinserting a new cartridge.andM;The 5510 supports all of Tegra's emulation programs.andP;  The base price for the5510 is $50,000, not including an Image Controller.andP;  Deliveries of the unitare scheduled to staff by September.andM;Varityper's 4000 Series, VT600 and EpicsandM;Prior to the acquisition by Tegra, Varityper already had begun a transitionfrom being a provider of complete, single-vendor systems to being a supplierof output devices for use with a variety of front-end systems.andP;  Its 4200 and4300 machines, introduced in 1987, initially supported input in Chelgraph'sAce language, so they were available for use with any systcms with Acedrivers, in addition to those using Varityper's own command language.andP;  Butmore than that, the company was moving to PostScript as its primary outputdevice language for machines sold to non-Varityper customers.andM;The company's PostScript capability started with the 600dpi VT600 and, soonafter, the wide-measure VT60OW, both of which used Adobe Atlas RIPs.andP;  Withthat behind them, Varityper negotiated another deal with Adobe for Adas Ripsfor the 4200 and 4300, thus making Varityper one of the key players in thePostScript market.andM;Almost concurrently with the broadening of its customer base to encompass themarket for high-resolution PostScript, Varityper was cutting back itsemphasis on front-end systems, not only by phasing out its historicdirect-input product line, but also by eliminating some of the othercomposition workstations in its lineup.andM;Then, with the acquisition of Varityper by Tegra, the company slipped evenfarther from its characterization as a supplier of smaU, complete systems forthe &quot;little guy&quot; to one focusing on output devices.andM;Also notable is that the output devices currently being sold are positionedconsiderably &quot;up market&quot; from where Varityper resided for most of the pastdecade or two.andM;We'll begin our look at the current Varityper line with the compositionsystems and follow with the output devices.andP;  Our report will be relativelybrief, though, because there aren't any major new announcements in eitherarea.andM;Epics: the survivorandM;There are basically two messages relating to front-end systems.andP;  One is thatthe Epics system lives on.andP;  The other is that the rest of Varityper'scomposition products have all been dropped.andP;  In fact, in contrast to severalyears ago, when Varityper's product fine was one of the most diverse, crowdedand confusing in the industry, it now looks nearly naked.andP;  Gone are:andM;* The Comp/Edit, long the workhorse, which had been reandM;designed to separate the terminal from the typesetter, but which remainedproprietary and single-user only.andP;  Manufacturing was halted last year.andM;* The Graphics Text Organizer (GTO), which faded away quiandM;etly more than a year ago.andM;* The Signature system for batch pagination, which was develandM;oped by Digital Composition Systems and which served as one of Varityper's PCproducts for nearly two years until it was terminated last year.andM;* Maxx, the other PC product, which lasted a couple of years,andM;then was phased out in the U.S., and now is virtually gone in Europe, too,where it had remained a current product after the U.S.andP;  exit.andP;  It is perhapsironic that when PC systems were viewed as the wave of die future, Varityperquickly picked up two of them, but now that PCs have established themselvesas viable products, Varityper has abandoned both of its offerings (Maxx andSignature).andM;The current lineup may lack variety, but at least it doesn't cause confusion,and that may account for the ability of the Epics system to survive as longas it has.andP;  Varityper doesn't disclose sales figures for Epics, but it saysthe system continues to sell well, although not as well as it was sellingseveral years ago.andP;  We asked for an approximation of the size of the userbase, particularly in comparison to the 800 or 900 customers still usingQuadex systems, and were told that they were in the same ballpark.andM;To summarize the current Epics situation, aB terminals now support the 20/20interactive functionality.andP;  That is, the 314 text terminal is no longeravailable.andP;  A single-terminal system with CPU is priced in the$21,000-$24,000 range.andP;  Additional 20/20 workstations cost $8,000 each, withpackage deals for larger system configurations.andM;The eternal platform question.andP;  We have been wonderring for several yearswhether Varityper would port its Epics software to a PC.andP;  The PC seemed alogical environment in which to duplicate Epics's general capabilities:non-WYSIWYG editing with a soft-copy preview for writers and editors, with aninteractive WYSIWYG workstation for production-oriented personnel.andP;  Therewould be questions about the keyboard and the network, but the compositionprogram, written in C, should port relatively easily to a PC.andM;Varityper has never made a commitment to port the software to anything.andP;  Whenwe visited East Hanover in July, we were given the impression that thesituation hasn't changed.andP;  The next incarnation hasn't becn decided andVarityper isn't hurrying its decision.andP;  The company thinks it has enough timeto make a decision, port the software and still notsee Epics sales dry up.andO;We aren't so optimistic.andP;  Perhaps Varityper's decreasing dependence on salesof composition systems means that a temporary loss of system revenueswouldn't be of great concern.andM;Nevertheless, with Agfa Compugraphic expected to introduce this fall acompletely revamped Quadex system running on Sun386i workstations, and withthe other vendors actively pursuing standard-platform solutions tocomposition, we wonder how long Epics can remain proprietary.andP;  Alphatype,which has a user base of more than 200 customers, runs on networked PCs.andO;Penta is moving to PC workstations.andP;  Atex is offering PC/Sun configurationsthat will be important in the magazine market and may extend to othercommercial customers.andP;  In addition, of course, other PC products (Mapa,Bestinfo, Ultimate) are entrenched in various system markets.andM;The future.andP;  While we wait for news on the next incarnation of the Epicssoftware, Varityper will continue to enhance the existing capabilities.andP;  Inaddition to some cosmetic changes that should make the system look moremodem, the planned enhancements include an interface to the Xerox 7650scanner, which will enable production of higher-quality graphics than arecurrerntly available with the existing Epics graphic system, called theVariScan 303P.andM;This system, introduced last year, is limited to the 300-dpi capabilities ofthe Datacopy 730 scanner.andP;  It enables scanned images to be called into Epicsfiles, displayed on the screen and cropped.andP;  But all other manipulation isdone on a PC running die graphics software.andM;Varityper hasn't made any other commitments, but it has talked about thepossibility of closer integration with Macintosh files.andM;The Macintosh as a front endandM;Like some other vendors, Varityper is a reseller of Macintoshes and offersthem in packages with PostScript output devices.andP;  Although there isn'tanything particularly exciting about this, Varityper has developed someinteresting desk accessories that are offered free to customers and to theworld at large (see below for details).andP;  These programs, supplied four on aMacintosh diskette, include a nice keyboard layout facility and some means ofstrean-dining font handling.andM;Varityper FontMaster lets the user print to the screen either images of thefonts or statistics relevant to them.andP;  The user can make font catalogues andcheck font number assignments.andP;  He can also view either all fonts installedin the system file or only those that are present in open suitcases and inthe system file simultaneously (a cardinal sin of Macintosh font management).andM;Varityper FontWizard examines the FOND resources to predict whether aspecific typestyle will be imaged by a precise font or a simulated one.andP;  Italso interrogates the chosen printer to determine whether the specific fontis resident in Rom or on disk.andP;  This accessory also brings the layout to thescreen and shows how to access each character, somewhat like the MacintoshKeycaps program, but it shows the entire 256 characters at a time, with theiroctal, decimal or hex codes and, as each is selected, the keystrokesnecessary to access it.andM;Varityper PSFontFinder examines PostScript files (including those in EPSFformat) to find out which fonts are called by the document.andP;  Thus, the usercan ensure that a job will not trigger the substitution of a default font.andM;The last of these desk accessories, Varityper FontConflict, predicts whatfont conflicts will occur when outputting on one Macintosh system a jobprepared on another Mac system.andM;These desk accessories are available free of charge from Mary Hughes atVarityper (11 Mt. Pleasant Ave., East Hanover, NJ 07936) or via theCompuServe online service, where they reside in Data Library 5 of the MacProforum under the file name VT-DAs.sit.andM;High-resolution output devicesandM;There is no question about where Varityper is going in the output devicearena: PostScript.andP;  It is dominated by PostScript, both the VT600 and VT60OWplain-paper machines and the 4300P and 420OB-P on photographic materials.andP;  Infact, the Ace version of the 4300 is now being sold only as an Epics outputdevice.andM;There have been no changes to the Varityper line of output devices since ourprevious reports.andP;  The CRT-technology 6800 remains in the product line toserve as a low-cost typesetter, in much the same fashion as Compugraphicretains its 8000.andP;  Unlike the 8000, though, which can be driven by manyvendors' systems, the 6800 serves primarily as a low-cost typesetter forEpics, since it doesn't provide storage for fonts.andP;  They must be downloadedfrom the front-end system.andM;Varityper hasn't indicated how long the 6800 will be offered or whether itmight later provide a lower-cost machine than the 4200.andP;  We expect that theVT600 has been designated as the output device for the low end.andM;The 420OB-P and 4300P.andP;  One of the more interesting developments of the earlyPostScript wars has been Varityper's activities at the low end of diehigh-resolution market.andP;  It initially introduced a 4200P machine whosespecifications were not too different from those of Linotypes Linotronic200P.andP;  But a few months later, a new version, called the 420OB-P, came outwith decidedly improved features.andM;Varityper reports that the 420OB-P is selling well, although we don't haveany specific numbers of sales.andP;  As we noted in our report on itsintroduction, it is priced the same as the 200P ($34,995) and itsspecifications look remarkably as if they were intended to outdo the 200P insome areas that would provide a sales edge.andM;The 420OB-P offers slightly higher resolution (1800/900 vs.andP;  1700/1270/635),has a recording engine whose maximum speed is more than twice as fast(13.3&quot;/min.andP;  at high resolution vs.andP;  6&quot;/min.), has twice as much memory (8 MBvs.andP;  4 MB) and more disk space (60- and 91-MB disks vs.andP;  a single 80-MBdisk), and includes more fonts (35 vs.andP;  13).andP;  On the other hand, Linotype hasa solid reputation as a provider of high-resolution PostScript, plus greaterrenown as a supplier of fonts and output devices to the world.andP;  It wiH beinteresting to see how this competition develops over the long run.andM;Thc 4300P, which sells for $53,995 in the U.S., is targeted more at theLinotronic 300.andP;  It supports a maximum resolution of 2400 dpi (and lowresolution of 1200), 12 MB of RAM and two 91 -MB disks (one for fonts and onefor page buffering).andM;In other respects, the 4300P and the 420OB-P are the same:andM;* The maximum line measure is 71.6 picas.andM;* The imaging system uses a laser-diode light source and aandM;rotating, eight-sided polygon mirror to deflect the b the recording medium.andM;* The film transport moves the photo material a raster line atandM;a time (with the increment depending on the resolution in effect).andM;* They have Adobe Adas RIPs that overlap the processing ofandM;two jobs.andP;  One page can be imaged while the next one is being processed inthe RIP.andM;Color output.andP;  Like the other machines in this market category, the 420OB-Pand die 4300P are not being sold as devices for handling most colorpublishing applications.andP;  In fact, Varityper doesn't even talk about usingthese machines to produce color-separation films, although we understand thatsome customers are outputting color film that they view as satisfactory.andM;We suspect that Tegra/Varityper's best solution for color may be the likelyavailability of the ECRM PelBox 3000 as a recording engine for the Tegra PCI,which should provide better results for color than would be obtainable withthe 4000 series.andM;As we have said in previous situations, the obstacles to producing qualitycolor on these machines include (1) the lack of precision in registration asdifferent pieces of film are imaged, and (2) the photo materials currentlyavailable for use with laser-diode machines may not be optimized to producesharp dots.andM;The VT600andM;Varityper says the majority of its VT600 customers are taking the W model,which supports 11&quot; x 17&quot; format.andP;  We asked about reliability now that diemachine has been in use for a couple of years.andP;  Varityper indicated thatcomplaints about reliability have decreased considerably, for severalreasons.andP;  One reason is that, in the early days, a lot of customers weretrying to use the machine beyond its normal capabilities, without respect fora normal duty cycle, which resulted in an abnormal number of service calls.andO;Another problem was that the service personnel had to get over their learningcurve to be able to fix.andP;  the problems quickly.andP;  Finally, we believe thatsome imnprove- ments have been made iii the engines since the early days,resulting in fewer problems.andM;ConclusionandM;The success rate for mergers and acquisitions in the electronic publishingindustry hasn't been great in recent years.andP;  Sometimes the acquired companiesare swallowed, leaving hardly a trace of the identity that they previouslyknew, and with them go some of the innovation and spirit that had beenimportant.andP;  Sometimes parent companies never really understand the needs androles of their new acquisitions and let them slide into mediocrity, lackingsupport and direction.andP;  Rarely do both companies survive with theiridentities intact.andM;In that perspective, the situation with Varityper and Tegra is a refreshingchange.andP;  It looks like a good situation for both companies-and therefore onethat will benefit the industry as a whole.andP;  With all due respect to AMInternational, which, as Addressograph-Multigraph, had acquired Varityper in1956, neither party was getting proper benefit from the relationship.andP;  AM hadnearly dragged Varityper down for thc count when it wallowed in Chapter 11bankruptcy for a year and a half in 1982-83.andP;  Synergy between the twocompanies was nearly nonexistent.andM;Tegra, meanwhile, was in need of approximately what Varityper had to offer,so it made a bid, got the deal, and the rest is history.andP;  Even the AM side ofthe story is a pleasant one, as the parent got the child off its back butretained rights to sell its products around the world.andM;That isn't to say that everything is coming up roses.andP;  We appreciatedVarityper's dedication to serving the low end of the publishing market.andP;  Forfive years The Seybold Report was published using various models of VarityperComp/Sets, which were quality machines at reasonable prices.andP;  Now that thecompany has begun its move upward in the market, die vacuum at the low endwill be noticed and lamented not by just a few.andM;Perhaps it was inevitable that Varityper-like Compugraphic-would see greenerpastures farther up market, but we would have liked to see one of the bigpublishing system vendors attempt to put together a proper low-end systemusing off-the-shelf components; something easy to use, appealing to the massmarket, and inexpensive.andM;That Varityper hasn't done it isn't the fault of Tegra, but the acquisitionapparently has helped to close off that avenue.andP;  Both companies agree thatsuccess is found easiest in the middle range .andM;On Thursday, August 17, the Camex, Inc.andP;  board of directors voted to acceptan offer from Du Pont to buy the company.andP;  Camex and Du Pont have signed adefitive agreement, subject to approval of Camex shareholders and certainother conditions.andP;  Terms of the deal were not disclosed.andP;  When theacquisition is completed, Camex will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary ofDu Pont, reporting to a board of directors appointed by Du Pont.andP;  Theexisting management will continue to run the company.andM;Coming on the heels of the Du Pont/Fuji acquisition of Crosfield, and of theacquisition of ImagiTex by Du Pont (see this issue), this move clearlyindicates that Du Pont intends to become the force to be reckoned with in alarge portion of the electronic prepress system business.andM;Market position.andP;  Camex says that its sales have been increasing at anaverage rate of 40% per year since 1983.andP;  Sales were $25 million in 1988, up55% from the year before.andP;  Sales for the first half of 1989 were $17 million.andM;Both Du Pont and Camex believe that Camex is poised to move from being asubsystem supplier to being a full system supplier.andP;  They believe that Camexhas established itself as a leading supplier of display ad systems for retailcustomers (Lord andamp; Taylor, Osco Drug, The New York Times, etc.).andP;  More thanthis, they believe that Camex is now ill a position to challenge Atex andSystem Integrators for leadership of the medium- to largesized newspapersystems market.andM;Camex believes that the system it is developing for the Houston Chronicle wiHdemonstrate a level of integration and functionality that none of the othernewspaper system vendors have been able to achieve.andP;  Because of this, itbelieves that it will be perfectly positioned to pick up the next round ofsystem business, from customers rolling over aging third-wave systems.andM;Hastech and CSI? When Du Pont acquired Crosfield, it said that it was doingso because of Crosfield's position in die color market.andP;  However, as part ofthe deal it also picked up the Crosfield newspaper system business (formerlyHastech and CSI).andP;  At the time, Du Pont told us that the fate of Crosfield'snewspaper system business would be up to Crosfield management.andM;We were naturally curious about the implications of the Camex acquisition,Clearly, Du Pont wants to be in the newspaper system business, but the Camexacquisition suggests that it thinks that Camex provides a better path to thefuture than does Crosfield.andM;We put this supposition to Du Pont.andP;  We were told that Du Pont is paying goodmoney for Hastech and CSI and that it believes they have ongoing value.andP;  Infact, Du Pont told us that it believes that owning competing newspaper systemtechnologies wiH be an advantage rather than a liability.andP;  It does not thinkthat any single system will satisfy the needs of all customers.andP;  Du Pontsubsidiaries will be able to offer customers a wide range of choices.andP;  willdecide which ones they want to buy.andM;At this point, Du Pont has no intention of trying to merge the companies orto integrate the product lines.andP;  Remember that each company (Camex andCrosfield) wiH report to its own board of directors, and that Du Pont wiU besharing ownership of Crosfield with Fuji.andM;This approach suggests the interesting spectacle of a Du Pont subsidiary(Camex) competing against a Du Pont/ Fuji subsidiary (Crosfield) for the samecustomers.andM;Negotiations.andP;  We believe that Camex and Du Pont have been talking on and offfor a tong time, Rumors of a possible deal began to spread in recent weekswhen Du Pont started its &quot;due diligence&quot; review of Camex.andP;  However, Du Pontdid not make an offer until after it had taken a close look at the company,and until it did so, Camex investors had no way to know if thev would beinterested.andM;Camex management must have mixed feelings about seUing the company.andP;  Itclearly believes in the future of die company.andP;  Yet, raising the capitalrequired to meet the needs of a rapidly growing company and to support afurious pace of software development is not fun.andP;  Having a parent companythat has both lots of resources and a firm belief in what you are trying toaccomplish makes things easier.andM;Implications:andM;* The consolidation of the industry conandM;tinues.andM;* Within the space of two months, DuandM;Pont has suddenly emerged as a formidable presence in die electronic prepressindustry.andM;* Du Pont resources, the Du Pont nameandM;and Du Pont commitment should be a significant help in turning Camex into themajor newspaper pagination player that both Camex and Du Pont think that itcan become.andM;DirectionsandM;A year after the acquisition, several key trends have become clear, includingthe one just noted: that both Tegra and Varityper have set their sightshigher in thc market than Varityper had in the past.andM;Focus on output.andP;  The Tegra/Varityper alliance has turned the overallcompany's focus much more toward output devices than toward front-endsystems, although Epics lingers as the company's one competitor in the systembusiness.andM;Versatility.andP;  In the output arena, the company has become a versatileparticipant.andP;  It now offers PostScript on both families of machines,including one of the Adobe variety and one from a clone manufacturer (CAI).andO;It and Compugraphic are the only supporters of PCL on high-resolutionmachines.andP;  The Tegra product line provides excellent support for Cora and CGcommand codes also, with the added benefit of providing some functions notfound on traditional Cora and CG devices.andP;  A lot of people needing to replace202s or 8400/8600 machines will consider Tegra seriously because of the extravalue it provides.andP;  Not only does the Tegra Image Controller support manyfeatures not found on traditional machines, but it also gives some front-endsystems the ability to take advantage of these features, which they wouldn'totherwise have.andM;One function it currently lacks is the ability to merge PostScript graphicswith non-PostScript files to output them on the same page.andP;  This is a logicaladdition to the capabilities of the Image Controller, but Tegra hasn'tcommited to it.andM;Color.andP;  The directions in color haven't been made clear, although we presumethat the ECRM PelBox 3000, with its color capabilities, will be available forthe Image Controller.andM;Network servers.andP;  With its Graphics Subsystem, Tegra already supports ascanner that can be interfaced to a variety of front-end systems, with theability to output graphics with text on any of its recorders.andP;  The companywould like to go beyond that and supply network servers for PostScriptproducts.andP;  The servers would support input from an image scanner and be ableto create a low-resolution view file to display on the screen.andP;  Output couldbe spooled to any available imagesetter.andP;  Fonts.andP;  The Tegra/Varityper fontlibrary contains more than 2,000 unique faces, after duplication between thetwo libraries has becn taken into account., The company plans to maintain itsnon-PostScript library as well as continue to develop its Adobe Type Onefonts with hints.andP;  Also planned is adding non-Latin scripts to the library.andM;Of greater interest to many customers, though, is that, with Tegra's ImageController, fonts need to be purchased only once.andP;  Because of the TICs use ofits database and font emulation, the same outlines can be used in differentenvironments.andP;  In view of aB of the complaints we hear from customers abouthaving to make multiple purchases of fonts, Tegra has a good answer thatshould be publicized.andM;Desk accessories.andP;  Development of desk accessories like the current set offont-related ones will continue.andM;Epics.andP;  With a large base of existing Epics customers, Varitypr has a lot togain by providing diem with a growth path and support for off-the-shelfworkstations.andP;  Epics is one of the few remaining systems that doesn't permita PC or Macintosh to be plugged into the system and serve as an editingstation or graphics tool.andP;  Varityper is talking about providing bettersupport for the Macintosh, including the ability to import Mac graphics intoEpics files.andP;  This would be a good start, but it is only a start.andM;Over the long term, of course, the proprietary hardware will disappear.andP;  Itremains to be seen when this will happen to Epics and what the new system wiHlook like.andP;  We would like to see a quality commercial system with strongdatabase and networking facilities.andP;  Whether it runs on a PC under OS/2, on aSun workstation or perhaps even on a Macintosh, it must fit into the picturesomewhere.andM;PostScript Imagewriters.andP;  Aside from the color question, the company lookspretty well set with its PostScript alternatives, offering Adobe or non-Adobeproducts in several price ranges.andP;  It has a good competitor in the $34,995420OB-P, plus the $54,995 4300P and the PCI, which costs $19,950 plus die TIC($23,500) and a recorder ($23,500 or $50,000 for a PelBox).andP;  A side benefitis the ability to drive multiple recorders with the same PostScript RIP.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
