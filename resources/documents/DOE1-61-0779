This reportdetermines the effect of the application technique, which must be suitablein order to fulfill the aforementioned requirement, on the quality ofthe installation. A single lot of material whose properties were establishedduring standardized horizontal blowing application was used. Variousinstallation techniques were used on standardized test walls, and theeffects of variations in technique and in blowing machine operation wereexamined. The results show that although cellulose fiber insulation doesnot settle if the space is uniformly filled and compacted about 10%,there is a large variation in installed density simply with a changein application technique while all other conditions remain constant.This indicates a need for proper training of installers. An appendixdescribes the construction of reference walls for use in cellulose fiberinsulation testing. 5 refs. 4 figs. 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
