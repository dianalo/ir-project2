Holders were to consider a management-led leveraged buyout offer for about $238.1 million at yesterday's meeting. However, Davis Mining made a counteroffer Wednesday. And the company is in talks with a third suitor, which wasn't identified.    Becor makes aerospace, mining and offshore oil gear.    The offer by Davis Mining, a Coeburn, Va.-based coal mining and explosives company, doesn't appear to exceed $255 million, the amount previously bid by Lynch Corp., a Fairfield, N.J.-based packaging and manufacturing concern. Lynch withdrew its offer Wednesday.    At next Thursday's meeting holders will either vote on the leveraged buyout offer or adjourn again while the board considers other offers.    The leveraged buyout is being led by Becor Western's president, William B. Winter, and includes other senior executives of the company and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., a New York investment banking concern. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that is utimately paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    Becor shares closed yesterday at $15.25, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
