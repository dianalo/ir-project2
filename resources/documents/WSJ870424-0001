PostsCharge on Note Default</HL><DD> 04/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DIGEARNINGS (ERN) </IN><DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Di Giorgio Corp. said it posted an after-tax charge of $8.4 million because a citrus-processing unit it sold in 1984 has defaulted on a note. The company also reported a loss for the first quarter.    Di Giorgio said it received the $31.9 million note from closely held TreeSweet Products Co., Houston, when it sold the TreeSweet operation. Di Giorgio subsequently sold the note to a third party and had to buy it back earlier this month when TreeSweet defaulted.    Di Giorgio is a diversified producer and distributor of food products.    As reported previously, TreeSweet is suing Di Giorgio for alleged fraud and misrepresentation in connection with the 1984 sale; Di Giorgio has called the allegations &quot;without merit.&quot;    Di Giorgio said it included the estimated charge from the note as a loss from discontinued operations in the latest quarter's results, but added that it &quot;may suffer substantial additional losses&quot; in the future.    The company yesterday reported a first-quarter net loss of $6.1 million, which included an $8.9 million loss from discontinued operations and a $1.2 million cumulative credit from an accounting change. Earnings from continuing operations were $1.7 million, down slightly from $1.9 million a year ago, when net income was $2 million, or 29 cents a share. Sales in the latest quarter were $281.4 million, up 10% from $255.1 million. </TEXT></DOC>
