The dispute over farm subsidies, pitting the United Statesagainst France and Germany, is threatening to jeopardize afour-year effort to reform the global trading system.   Speaking of an agreement on subsidies, Yeutter told Swedishnational television: ``The chances of success are very, very slim.We hope that something will change in the next couple of weeks toalter that assessment.'' He spent the last week meeting withEuropean officials to seek a farm subsidies agreement. Officialshad hoped to resolve the issue in time for global trade talksscheduled to open in Brussels, Belgium, on Dec. 3.   The United States and other big farm exporters, like Argentina,want the agriculture agreement to include 75 percent cuts insubsidies and 90 percent cuts in customs tariffs.   The 12-member European Community, including France and Germany,has offered to agree to a 30 percent cut in farm subsidies over 10years. Sweden and other European countries that are not members ofthe EC have agreed to subsidy cuts of up to 50 percent.   The global trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round for thecountry where they were launched in 1986, involve 105 nations.   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills warned Thursday that afailure of the trade talks in Belgium would increase tensions amongtrading partners and could frustrate international cooperation onissues ranging from the gulf crisis to the environment.   The Bush administration has a lot riding on the trade agreement.U.S. officials believe that removing trade barriers is the besthope for lowering huge U.S. trade deficits by expanding overseassales.   Farmers in Europe have staged noisy protests in recent weeks toassure their governments do not buckle under to pressure to lowerfarm subsidies.</TEXT></DOC>
