the new file system can also support filesand partitions up to 2Gb in size.andP;  Extended Edition has been enhanced throughupgrades to the Database Manager and the Communications Manager.andP;  TheDatabase Manager can now share remote data via the Systems ApplicationArchitecture Remote Data Services facilities to provide OS/2 machines on alocal net transparent access to databases in other workstations on thenetwork.andP;  The Database Manager is enhanced with referential integrity,&quot;cursor stability&quot;, the ability to grant and revoke access authorisationcapability, and adds pre-compilers for Cobol, Pascal, and Fortran.andP;  TheCommunications Manager is enhanced with an SNA gateway and now uses theNetwork Driver Interface Specification to support Ethernet and 802.3 localnetwork protocols.andP;  According to Microsoft Corp, the IBM product will support13 categories of local network application programming interfaces that arederivations of comparable Microsoft LAN Manager interfaces.andP;  OfficeVisionmakes use of the Extended Edition 1.2 LAN Requester, based on LAN Managertechnology.andP;  OS/2 Extended Edition workstations running OfficeVision will beable to use resources on LAN Manager-based servers, and LAN Managerworkstations will be able to access IBM LAN Server, comments Microsoft.andP;  Bothnew versions of OS/2 provide support for MS-DOS 4.0 in MS-DOS mode.andM;OfficeVision expands OS/2 Extended roleandM;IBM reckons that with the OfficeVision announcements, theandM;programmable workstation - personal computer to everyone else - gets anexpanded role within Systems Application Architecture because theOfficeVision Family uses the PS/2 to provide access to enterprise-widefunction.andP;  And - with the new release of the OS/2 operating systems - therole of the workstation in SAA is further emphasised by extensions to theelements of Systems Application Architecture - Common Communications Support,Common Programming Interface and Common User Access - using  more fully thePS/2 graphics and display.andP;  Commenting on the new 1.2 release of OS/2Extended Edition, IBM notes that it uses the functions of OS/2 StandardEdition Version 1.2 as its base operating system, enhanced with the DialogManager that conforms to IBM's Systems Application Architecture Common UserAccess.andP;  It also includes &quot;an&quot; SAA Procedures Language - a version of REXX,presumably - to enable programmers to write command procedures in a clear,structured way.andP;  As well as SNA gateway, Ethernet DIX Version 2.0 and IEEE802.3, the new release offers X25, asynchronous and 3270 terminal emulatorenhancements, with 3270 host directed print, 3270 host graphics enabling, andmodifications so that they can run as Presentation Manager applications.andO;Cobol/2 language support is added, and support for the AS/400 is enhancedwith a 5250 Work Station Feature and twinaxial attachment.andP;  The LAN Requestersupports the OS/2 LAN application programming interfaces and takes advantageof the performance improvements and large disk media managementcharacteristics provided by the new High Performance File System option ofOS/2 Standard Edition Version 1.2.andP;  As well as remote data services, DatabaseManager enhancements include an MS-DOS Database Requester, SAA ProceduresLanguage  support, and a Query Manager-callable interface, and a businessgraphics interface.andP;  The Query Manager is  modified to run as a PresentationManager application.andP;  Out in November in the US, and free to 1.1 users, ithas a one-time charge of $830.andM;Enhancements to the Standard EditionandM;As for OS/2 Standard Edition, probably the most importantandM;enhancement is the addition of the Dialog Manager conforming to SystemsApplication Architecture, which is included in OS/2 Programming Tools andInformation 1.2, and enables application developers to implement applicationdialogues that take advantage of Presentation Manager facilities, includingthe ability to be windowed.andP;  The user interface is enhanced through theDesktop Manager using iconic representation and direct manipulation for filesand programs; Presentation Manager is enhanced for SAA Common User Access andapplication development, and there are Cobol/2 and Fortran/2 languageinterfaces for Presentation Manager.andP;  There is a new High Performance FileSystem, Windowed System Editor; inclusion of an Adobe Systems PostScriptdevice driver for the IBM 4216-030 laser printer.andP;  The Programmer's Toolkitand Technical Reference are now combined into the single Programming Toolsand Information, and is updated for the features of the new release of OS/2Standard 1.2.andP;  Available September 29 in the US, OS/2 Standard carries a one-time charge of $340, and the Programmer's Toolkit and Technical Referencecosts $650.andM;OS/2 Image Support for non-specialistsandM;There is a new OS/2 Image Support program designed to enablesandM;office professionals (as opposed to amateurs) to create colour, grey, ortwo-level images for inclusion in documents, under OS/2, but it needs thespeed and storage available in either Standard 1.2 or Extended 1.2 operatingenvironment.andP;  Images can be created using a scanner or video camera, and canthen be modified, printed, have their format changed, be displayed andmanipulated as well as created, by users with no specialised computer skills.andO;It prints on all-points-addressable printers supported by OS/2, and also onthe Mitsubishi G650 and Shinko CHC-345 colour printers.andP;  OS/2 Image Supportis accessed from the main OS/2 OfficeVision window via an image icon, orinvoked automatically, and using the OfficeVision/2 communication links,images can be stored and retrieved from an OS/400, MVS, or VM host or localarea network server.andP;  Images can also be used by programs such asOfficeVision/2.2 correspondence processor, Storyboard Plus, InterleafPublishing, and image-capable IBM DisplayWrite products.andP;  &quot;The advancedCustomer User Access (CUA) (spot IBM's deliberate mistake!) interfaceprovided by OS/2 Image Support is consistent with OfficeVision/2.2&quot;, IBMsays.andP;  The product also extends image capability to application developers,who can use the programming interface to build OS/2 image applicationswithout the developer having to have extensive training in image technology.andO;The thing carries a one-time charge of $595, but don't get all fired up - itwon't be out until March 1990, even in the US.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
