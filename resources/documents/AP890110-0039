Advocates for federal retirees also attacked the spending planMonday, saying it was unfair for Reagan to recommend that theretirees be denied a cost-of-living adjustment next year whileawarding such an increase to Social Security recipients.   Both groups said the principal ammunition in their fight againstthe Reagan budget proposals will be the 50 percent raise thepresident recommended for members of Congress, federal judges andother government executives. The unions also complained that Reaganrecommeded a 3.6 percent pay raise for military personnel but only 2percent for civilian government workers.   ``President Reagan is leaving office as he entered _ bashing thefederal work force,'' John N. Sturdivant, president of the AmericanFederation of Government Employees, said Monday after the presidentreleased his farewell budget.   ``AFGE will be counting on President-elect Bush to work with usin reforming the present civil service pay system, which is totallyinadequate and outdated,'' said Sturdivant, whose union is thelargest representing federal workers.   Sturdivant and Robert M. Tobias, president of the NationalTreasury Employees Union, said federal pay scales lag about 26percent behind those for comparable private sector jobs.   ``Federal employees will not settle for paltry 2 percent raiseswhile top government officials get increases of up to 50 percent,''said Tobias.   He expressed hope that Congress, which is expected to delay anyaction on the budget until Bush makes his own recommendations forfiscal 1990 spending, would be more sympathetic to federal workers _especially at a time when the lawmakers stand to see their annualpay rise from $89,500 to $135,000.   ``We're confident that Congress will act in the best interest ofthe nation and provide a substantial pay raise for the rank-and-fileand not just a substantial pay raise for themselves,'' Tobias said.   Reagan said the government would save $1.4 billion by freezingthe cost-of-living adjustments for federal retirees next year. Thepresident also suggested future COLAs for that system be capped atone percentage point below inflation.   But Reagan requested no such changes to Social Security.   ``Here we go again,'' said Judith Park, legislative director forthe National Association of Retired Federal Employees. ``Our adviceto Congress would be to remember that inflation doesn't discriminateand neither should inflation protection.''   The approximately 3.6 million retirees received a 4.2 percentcost-of-living adjustment in January 1988.   The raises for Congress, federal judges, Cabinet members andother federal executives were suggested by a commission that meetsin presidential election years to review federal salaries.   Reagan last week said he endorsed the proposal, and the budget hesubmitted to Congress on Monday contained $380 million to pay forthe raises.   If approved, those raises would also increase the pensions paidto Reagan after he leaves office and to other former presidents,whose pensions are tied to the salaries given Cabinet members. Theraises will take effect unless both chambers of Congress vote toreject them, which is not expected.   Chief among the complaints of the federal workers' unions wasthat their members' annual raises have lagged behind inflation.   Most federal workers received a 4.1 percent pay increaseeffective Jan. 1. In January 1988 they got a 2 percent raise and inJanuary 1987 a 3 percent pay boost. Their last raise prior to thatwas a 3.5 percent raise in 1985.   Annual inflation for 1987 and 1988 was 4.4 percent, up from 1.1percent in 1986 and 3.8 percent in 1985, according to governmentfigures.</TEXT></DOC>
