Comcast, a major operator of local cable-televisionsystems that also owns cellular-phone networks, said theplanned two-year test is intended to determine whether itscable systems can carry telephone calls and be linked withcellular phone systems.</LP><TEXT>   Comcast joins Time Warner Inc., Cablevision Systems Corp.and several other cable providers in their interest in movingin on local telephone service. Last month, Time Warner'scable group filed a similar FCC request for a four-city testof personal communications networks, or PCN.   Proponents say such networks, carrying phone calls alongcable systems' coaxialcable and optical fiber lines, couldultimately lead to home phones that are cordless, mobile andfar lighter and smaller than existing technology allows.   But the cable companies' move into telephone territoryseems likely to draw opposition from phone companies, whichhave been consistent rivals and critics of the cableindustry. The two industries already have clashed overefforts by regional phone companies to enter the cablebusiness by carrying television signals over the phonesystems' extensive fiber-optic lines.   Cable firms have fiercely opposed the phone companies'efforts to enter their terrain, arguing that the local phonesystems shouldn't be allowed to compete with cable bysubsidizing the effort with revenue from a regulatedmonopoly. Now, the phone companies could use the sameargument: cable companies -- an unregulated local monopoly inmost markets -- shouldn't be able to subsidize a move intotelecommunications with revenue they receive from largelyunregulated rates.   But Brian L. Roberts, Comcast's president and chiefoperating officer, rejected the parallel and insisted thatcable's role in PCN would be merely a &quot;complementary&quot; effortthat wouldn't necessarily compete with local phone service.   &quot;It's an additive product, it's expansionary,&quot; he said.While phone service is a &quot;necessity,&quot; cable television ismore an accessory, he added. In addition, when AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. was broken up in the early 1980s,splitting up into seven major regional phone companies, &quot;theyagreed not to go into other businesses.&quot; Cable hasn't madeany such pledge, he noted.   Telecommunications industry officials couldn't be reachedfor immediate comment on Comcast's FCC filing. Mr. Roberts,however, maintains that he doesn't expect phone companies tooppose the request to conduct the experiment and said theyare working on similar projects.   If approved by the FCC, the experiment would occur in fiveareas that have different characteristics in terms ofterrain, population density and other factors. They includeBaltimore; Philadelphia and Trenton, N.J., where Comcastoperates both a local cable system and a cellular phonesystem; West Palm Beach; Indianapolis; and Los Angeles.   While other cable companies have focused on linking theircable lines with local or long-distance phone companies,Comcast is more interested in links between cable andcellular technologies. It will test such link-ups in Trenton,in particular.   Current cellular phone service is hampered by sometimespoor reception, cutoffs, and limited reach, in part becausethe &quot;cells&quot; or calling areas are up to five square miles insize. Comcast proposes smaller &quot;micro-cells&quot; covering only500 homes.   That approach would let a cable company place far morecalling areas for phone traffic, then route calls from acordless cellular phone to a micro-cell, then onto coaxialcable or fiber-optic lines used usually for TV signals,traveling onward to a bigger cell site in a cellular phonesystem.   The greater number of &quot;micro-cells&quot; would give callsbetter reception and let phones use smaller, less-powerfultransmitters, thereby allowing for smaller, lighter phonesthat use little power, Comcast officials maintain.   Much of this technology, however, has yet to be proven.&quot;You really have to take conceptional ideas and turn theminto the practical, and this is the only way to find out,&quot;said Mark Coblitz, Comcast's vice president for strategicplanning.</TEXT></DOC>
