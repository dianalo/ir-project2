<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-91-0114 </DOCNO><TEXT>The problem is considered of natural compatibility of small neutrino massandless;or approx. 30 eV with a hypothetical neutrino magnetic moment 10/sup-10/-10/sup -10/ of the Bohr magneton which is suggested for explanationof possible modulation of the solar neutrino flux. It is argued thatsuppression of the neutrino mass with finite magnetic moment can be aconsequence of SU(2) symmetry between neutrino and antineutrino. A modelis discussed with SU(4) symmetry in the lepton electroweak sector inwhich the neutrino magnetic moment arises via charged scalars belongingto SU(4) sextet, and the neutrino mass is generated only at the two-looplevel through electroweak radiative corrections. To naturally keep theneutrino mass in the range 10-30 eV the masses of the charged scalarsshould be of order few tens of GeV. Thus, it makes sense to look forthese scalar particles at new e/sup +/e/sup -/ colliders. 13 refs.; 3figs.</TEXT></DOC>
