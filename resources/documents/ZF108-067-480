Martin to venture intounexplored CD-ROM territory?andM;Martin is a project specialist in the dealer services department for Ford NewHolland, the Ford Motor Company's agricultural machinery division in NewHolland, Pennsylvania.andP;  Her primary job is to write documentation for thefirm's dealer communication systems.andM;&quot;I'm not a programmer,&quot; Martin says.andP;  &quot;I know how to use a computer--that'sabout it.&quot;andP;  Yet, in the fall of 1988, Ford New Holland put her in charge ofbuilding a CD-ROM application to supplement a costly online system itsdealers were already using.andP;  One option was to contract the job out to aservice bureau (see &quot;Should You Hire a Service Bureau to Do the Job?&quot; on page68), but Martin close to tackle the project herself.andP;  After a single day oftraining on a CD-ROM development package from Dataware Technologies, asoftware firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she produced an applicationthat gives Ford New Holland's dealers instant cross-referenced and indexedaccess to prices, descriptions, and nearly everything else they might need toknow about 300,000 parts and components from the division's product line.andM;Martin used Dataware's CD Author software to build an easy-to-use, menudrivenapplication from tapes of raw data supplied by Ford New Holland's dataprocessing department.andP;  If a customer wants a hose for a certain tractor, forexample, now &quot;all the dealer has to do,&quot; Martin says, &quot;is type in the wordhose and the tractor's model number, and the system prints a list of all thehoses used in that tractor.&quot;andM;Keeping tabs on tractors and plows hardly seems to demand feats ofinformation system prowess.andP;  So why is Ford New Holland venturing towardtechnology's edge with its early commitment to CD-ROM?andM;Like the other CD-ROM pioneers to whom we spoke, Martin seems to find thequestion a curious one, as if the answer is obvious.andP;  &quot;The dealers wantedthis information without having to go online to our mainframe.andP;  We didn'tknow how else to give it to them other than on a CD.&quot;andM;Paper ChaseandM;Of course, the way of a pioneer is not all blue skies and smooth roads.andP;  Evenapplications that seem perfect for a new technology may prove costly toimplement at first.andP;  Just ask Ron Kercheval, of the directorate ofinformation management in the Army Corps of Engineers' Printing andPublications Management Office.andP;  In 1988 Kercheval joined forces withBoulder, Colorado-based Reference Technology to build the Corps' first CD-ROMapplication.andM;The application was intended to cut costs by transferring to CD format thehundreds of manuals, specification guidelines, and procedural guides that theCorps publishes and distributes to its divisions, districts, and labs aroundthe world.andM;In an era of belt-tightening, CD-ROM was a natural choice for the Corps,Kercheval says.andP;  &quot;I have one manual on my desk, 800-odd pages.andP;  It costs us$6.51 to print, $6.37 to mail, and it weighs 4 pounds.andP;  We need a12,000-square-foot warehouse to store all our publications.andP;  Meanwhile, allthese cuts in printing funds were coming through.andP;  I thought that if we movedit all to CD-ROM, we could send out every publication and form we have on acouple of discs.&quot;andM;Kercheval was right, but getting the publications onto disc proved to be aPromethean task.andP;  While the systems people at Ford New Holland were able togive Carmen Martin all the data she needed on mainframe tapes, many of theCorps' publications existed only in paper form.andP;  As a result, Kercheval'steam had to run each page through a scanner twice to import it into theapplication--onece to create a graphic image of the actual page that wouldinclude charts or tables and allow the building of hypertex-like linksbetween documents, and once to capture the text in ASCII form so that itcould be searched, printed at high speed, and so forth.andP;  (For more on what ittakes to convert paper documents into CD-ROM format, see &quot;What Do You Need toPublish a CD-ROM?&quot; on page 70.)andM;&quot;The cost of the first disc [which contained some 17,000 pages of text andgraphics] was considerably more than the cost of printing the same materialsby conventional means,&quot; Kercheval says.andP;  &quot;It was not like printing  a book.&quot;andO;But he adds that this one-time charge will be repaid each time the Corps ofEngineers sends out a new CD-ROM disc.andP;  &quot;We're in the process now of revising300 engineering documents, manuals, and specifications, and we're doing itall in electronic form so we won't have to repeat that process.andM;&quot;I bought CD-ROM and I'm sold on it.andP;  I don't advocate that CD-ROM totallyreplace the hard-copy document.andP;  You can't read it on the subway.andP;  We'restill going to have to print some documents.andP;  But maybe we can print 5,000instead of 20,000, and we'll have less to ship and store.&quot;andM;Portable OmnibusandM;Kercheval's enchantment with the ability of CD-ROM to cut shipping costsunderlines one of the technolog's most appealing features: portability.andM;Mack Trucks, for instance, wanted to supply its dealers with an electronicparts catalog that they could use in any number of locations, from a customerservice counter to a repair bay to a wreck site.andP;  The system had to bedurable, easy to use, and able to access massive amounts of data relating tothe 487,000 custom trucks Mack has produced since 1968.andM;After explorung a range of alternatives, from building an online referencesystem to retaining its existing microfiche-based catalog, the companysettled on a CD-ROM-based application using portable touch-screen CDworkstations from Image Storage/Retrieval Systems, of Langhorne,Pennsylvania.andP;  It reasons, like those of Ford New Holland and the Army Corpsof Engineers, were purely practical: CD-ROM promised to do the job better andcheaper.andM;Initial field tests of the system, dubbed MacSpec, in May 1989 proved thereality of that promise: service personnel were able to identify partsseveral times faster and with far greater accuracy than with the oldmicrofiche system.andM;Since those tests, more than half of the company's distributors have signedup to use the system (paying for it on an annual lease basis), according toDave Covey, manager iof specifications and technical services for MackTrucks.andP;  More dealers are expected to sign up soon.andM;The key to Mack Trucks' success was the company's ability to make the powerof CD-ROM technology highly accessible by linking the parts database to auser-friendly, graphical fron end.andP;  &quot;Our main business is trucks, notcomputers, and the people who are using the system aren't trained computerusers, but it's gone pretty smoothly,&quot; Covey says.andM;Auditing Manuals by the TonandM;A similar need for portability led Arthur Anderson andamp; Co. to develop aninternal CD-ROM application.andP;  Shahzad Bashir, a senior manager in theaccounting firm's Chicago World Headquarters office, recalls that the companyused to ship a halfton or more of reference material to client offices foruse by the firm's professionals during on-site audits and consultations.andM;&quot;Often, when you deal with such a large volume of information, retrieval isnot easy in relation to either time or efficiency,&quot; Bashir notes.andM;In 1986 the firm initiated a seach for a more efficient, less costly way ofsupplying data on-site.andP;  Since the professionals already used portable PCs,CD-ROM seemed like a suitable solution, despite its then-uncertain future.andO;Accoridng to Bashir, the firm estaimated that even if CD-ROM didn't pan out,up to 85 percent of the work that went into developing a CD-ROM applicationwould be directly transferable to any other electronic data-driventechnology.andP;  (The subsequent emergence of the High Sierra, ISO 9660, andother standards for CD-ROM file and directory structure have greatlysolidified CD-ROM's status and its future.)andM;The firm set out to transfer the hundreds of documents its professionals useinto a database that could be stored on a single CD-ROM disc.andP;  Bashir and L.andO;Jack Dreiss, an Andersen partner, led the development effort, and by May 1987Arthur Andersen had successfully tested a prototype disc in three countries.andO;By the next fall, the full application, complete with a Microsoft Windowssurface, had been installed on 1,200 CD-ROM drives worldwide.andM;&quot;I honestly believe our application is one of the most sophisticated anduser-friendly CD-ROM applications extant and has one of the largest userbases,&quot; Bashir says.andP;  &quot;Our goals were to increase the productivity andefficiency of our professionals and to reduce our printing and distributioncosts.andP;  We succeeded very well on both counts.&quot;andM;According to Arthur Andersen's white paper, the firm's initial CD-ROMapplication repaid its multimillion-dollar development cost in reducedshipping and printing expenditures within two years:  &quot;By adding in 'softdollar' savings associated with increased productivity, the application paidfor itself in an even shorter time.&quot;andM;The Right Places for Your MoneyandM;Few if any CD-ROM applications developed today will cost as much as ArthurAndersen's pioneering work.andP;  Still, producing a CD-ROM application is costlyenough that it makes sense to concentrate initial development on themoney-draining areas that will benefit most from improved efficiency andreduced costs--training, for instance, as illustrated by office systemsvendor Steelcase, Inc., of Grand Rapids, Michigan.andM;According to Phil Camillo, program director of Steelcase's trainingdepartment for office computer systems, the methods the company now uses tofamiliarize salespeople at dealerships around the country with theintricacies of its huge product line are costly and inefficient.andP;  &quot;Thebooklets we are currently using in product training are not doing the job.andO;&quot;We're not sure that they're being read, and we have no way of knowingwhether the information is being retained and used.&quot;andM;As a result, Camillo set out last year to find a training vehicle that couldboth use the firm's PCs and Macs as learning tools and quantity a trainee'sprogress through tests and quizzes.andM;To that end, he is evaluating a CD-ROM-based training program that would usesoftware from Authorware to build course material for the marketing and salesstaff.andP;  The firm has not yet committed to the technology, but Camillo findsits inter-active nature attractive and feels that it addresses many of theshortcomings of current training methods.andP;  &quot;With CD-ROM we can do 256-colorgraphics and animation.andP;  I can interface with a laserdisc and IBM'sInfoWindow [a multimedia development system.]  I have the capability of atrue multimedia training format.andP;  .  .  .  What's more interesting, that or ablack-and-white booklet?&quot;andM;Mining New FieldsandM;CD-ROM is not only a powerful tool for cutting business costs--manyorganizations have discovered that it can create new business opportunitiesas well.andM;Boston-based Nynex Information Resources, for instance, used an extendedversion of Dataware's CD Author software to publish a single CD-ROM disccontaining 9.8 million telephone listings accessible by name, address,telephone number, or zip code.andP;  Its intended primary market was heavy usersof its directory assistance service, such as the credit-verificationdepartments of retail chains.andM;Instead, the compnay has found that the instant accessibility of thedirectory's data, and the fact that Nynex updates it monthly, gives it broadappeal in a number of previously overlooked markets.andM;Howard York, manager of directory systems development for Nynex, says thatthe CD-based directory has been welcomed by municipalities (&quot;Tax people, thetown clerk, water departments--they're our biggest customers&quot;), collectionagencies (&quot;You can find someone's name and get a list of neighbors veryeasily&quot;), and law enforcement agencies (&quot;It saves hundreds of hours oflooking up telephone numbers&quot;).andM;&quot;It surprised me.andP;  We never envisioned these markets,&quot; York recalls.andP;  But,before CD-ROM made it possible, no one had ever offered a product like thedirectory, which provides instant access to any telephone number in Nynex'sservice area.andP;  &quot;We compete for these accounts against paper directories thatare updated quarterly at best.andP;  Our information is about 20 to 21 days oldwhen it gets to the customer, so companies that don't need up-to-the-minuteinformation can save a lot of money compared with directory assistance at 47cents a call in New York.&quot;andM;In Raleigh, North Carolina, Stan Eskridge, president of a startup companycalled DataPix Publishing, and his small staff are tackling another immenseproject: publishing a multiple-disc electronic catalog that will includeillustrations and specifications of every product available from everyAmerican interior furnishings manufacturer.andP;  &quot;This is a $60-to-80-billionwholesale per year industry,&quot; Eskridge says, &quot;with thousands of companiessome of which have thousands of products.&quot;andM;Eskridge acknowledges that the project would be impossible without CD-ROM.andO;&quot;The technology and the market opportunity have come together,&quot; he says.andP;  Thefirm's founder, Martha Dalitzky, spent several years developing an indexingsystem for all the varieties of products that will appear in the catalog.andO;Now Eskridge and his staff are using Knowledge Access International's KAwareDisk Publisher software to apply that system to the first edition of theInterior Furnishings Electronic Catalog, due out this spring.andM;More esoteric applications seem to wait around every corner.andP;  One hugecompany is developing a project that will use a CD-ROM-based application toidentify redundant or conflicting efforts within its many divisions.andP;  Thecompany plans to produce a CD-ROM disc containing the business plans,marketing statements, and other work papers of each division, then have a PCcrunch away at the data, using text-pattern and keyword searches, to identifyareas in which one division's plans conflict with or duplicate another'sandM;Time and again, managers are finding that CD-ROM publishing is an effective,cost-saving way to manage volumes of information.andP;  CD-ROM technology addsvalue to the information it delivers and spawns an infectious enthusiasm inthose who have discovered its capabilities.andP;  As Ron Kercheval of the ArmyCorps of Engineers said at the end of our interview, &quot;Do I soundenthusiastic?andP;  I feel like a vacuum cleaner salesman--if you're not sold yet,I want to spill something else onto the floor and prove it works.andP;  .  .  . andO;This is the future of publishing.&quot;andM;Should You Hire a ServiceandM;Bureau to Do the Job?andM;Publishing CD-ROMs is less risky than you may think.andP;  You have three basicoptions: you can plunge into production, keeping the entire process withinyour company's control; you can manage various stages of the job in-house,gradually raising your investment and involvement; or you can hire an outsideservice bureau to produce your application from start to finish.andM;In-house production requires an investment in authoring and retrievalsoftware, staff hours, and possibly premastering equipment.andP;  Initial costs(excluding staff) can vary from $5,000 to $200,000.andP;  (For more on doing thejob yourself and about the software you'll need, see &quot;What Do You Need toPublish a CD-ROM?&quot; on page 70.)andM;With each step that you handle yourself, your costs generally drop.andP;  Plus,you gain greater control over how the database is built, the features of theinterface, and the general quality of your application.andM;Using a service bureau can cost three to five times as much as developing aCD-ROM application in-house, and it can reduce your control over the project.andO;But when you publish out-of-house, someone else will handle any problems thatarise.andM;Though pricey, a service bureau can be the best alternative if you plan tobuild only one application that requires infrequent (for example, annual)updating.andM;Dan Carson, manager of marketing at Image Storage/Retrieval Systems (ISRS),which makes a portable CD drive along with compatible authoring and retrievalsoftware, helped an auto insurance company develop and equip its claimsadjustos with a searchable database of auto parts for more than 1,400 carmodels.andP;  Because the insurance company planned to build only one CDapplication, and because it will update the database only annually, it didn'twant to invest in the workhours and hardware for in-house production.andM;Also, a service bureau may cost less than you think.andP;  Capturing, converting,and indexing your database is the most expensive part of publishing a CD.andO;Out-of-house production will cost less if your data is easy toconvert--especially if it's already in electronic form.andM;Last June, the Department of Defense awarded Dataware Technologies a contractto convert the DoD's Hazardous Materials Information System, stored onmicrofiche, to nearly 3,000 CD copies.andP;  The database included more than52,000 records, with as many as 214 searchable fields in each.andP;  At first, thecost of hiring a bureau to index such a complex database seemed prohibitive.andO;But because the database was already on tape, it was relatively simple toconvert.andP;  Dataware produced the application for $14.50 per CD.andM;When selecting a service bureau, look for companies that produceoff-the-shelf authoring and retrieval software.andP;  Their experience withdeveloping a wide range of applications can be invaluable.andP;  Also, considerhow well their software products will fit your company's future needs.andP;  Whileapplications developed on ISRS's authoring and retrieval software, forexample, can run on hardware platforms other than the company's proprietarydrive, you'll need one of the company's proprietary boards to do it.andM;Finally, you may want to use a service bureau to test the waters.andP;  Manycompanies publish their first application out-of-house before investing in anin-house system: the $10,000 to $40,000 it typically costs to have a bureaudevelop a small application helps them decide whether it's worthwhile tospend much more on full authoring and premastering hardware and software, notto mention staff and overhead.andM;What Do You Need to Publish a CD-ROM?andM;Publishing your own CD requires plenty of planning, much of it to accommodatethe peculiarities of the technology.andM;A compact disc has one spiral track that winds from the inside of the disc tothe outer edge.andP;  As the CD-ROM drive head moves across the surface, the speedof the disc's rotation varies to ensure that the data moves past the drive'slaser beam detector at a constant velocity.andP;  This optimizes the density ofdata on the disc but takes its toll in access time, which can be ten times aslong as that of typical hard disks.andM;As a result, one of the most important steps in developing a CD-ROM isindexing: organizing the vast amounts of information bound for disc in a waythat will minimize access time.andP;  This task involves using the authoring andretrieval software to index keywords (in a full-text database, virtuallyevery word is a keyword), add cross-references, and divide the informationinto logical blocks to allow for efficient retrieval.andM;Finally, because of the density of data on a CD-ROM, error correction anddetection coding must be included on the disc.andP;  This process is handled inthe premastering stage, along with address coding for the index andsynchronization coding to ensure constant velocity.andM;If you're producing your CD in-house, you'll need the right tools to do thesejobs: an authoring and retrieval package and PC-based premastering equipment.andM;Authoring and RetrievalandM;Unless your company has a standing software-development operation, you'llwant to buy an off-the-shelf authoring and retrieval package.andP;  Thisdevelopment tool tackles the most expensive phases of CD publishing:converting and indexing data (authoring) and building a front end(retrieval).andM;Because the way you retrieve data depends on how the data is indexed, vendorssell these programs as a package.andP;  Authoring programs cost anywhere from$795, for Knowledge Access International's Disk Publisher, to $30,000, forDataware's CD Author.andP;  Licensing costs and arrangements for retrievalpackages vary widely, though most vendors charge according to the number ofCDs you intend to press.andM;Authoring programs such as Disk Publisher, CD Author, and Quantum Access'sQuantum Leap can create indexes for text, structured (spreadsheet ordatabase) data, and images.andP;  Disk Publisher, Quantum Leap, and ExecutiveTechnologies' SearchExpress, among others, also let you create hypertextlinks between text and images--extremely useful if you're developingtechnical manuals, references, and training applications.andM;Some authoring programs also feature a data-conversion engine that helps youtranslate your database into a format for indexing.andP;  No conversion engine isperfect, given the bewildering array of formats in which raw data can appear.andO;Thus, converting your database into a suitable format--especially itsimages--often requires some programming expertise.andP;  And while all leadingauthoring packages are menu-driven, most require two to five days of trainingfrom the vendor.andM;Retrieval software may also require programming if you want to customize theinterface.andP;  The key to selecting a retrieval program is knowing your user'sneeds.andP;  LaserRetrieve, from Hewlett-Packard, for example, runs underMicrosoft Windows--but unless everyone in your organization uses Windows,this package might limit the kinds of CD applications you can build.andO;Innerview, from TMS, comes in versions for both DOS and Windows.andM;In 1988 the U.S.andP;  Patent and Trademark Office created a CD-ROM applicationcontaining information on all patents granted since 1790 so that anyone canlook them up without human assistance.andP;  Because the archive is meant to servePC users at all levels of experience, its interface must be extremely easy touse.andP;  The Patent and Trademark Office chose Dataware's CD Author for itsfunction-key-driven menus and context-sensitive help screens and for itsability to handle very large structured databases.andM;Features of retrieval software vary widely among packages.andP;  SearchExpress,for example, lets you use pull-down menus and choose either a beginner or anexpert mode for searching.andP;  Full Text Manager, from Reference Technology,lets you add a full library of database management functions for bettersearching.andP;  And Quantum Leap lets you incorporate audio data with text andimages.andM;Mastering PremasteringandM;If your company plans to publish four or more applications a year (which cancost between $2,000 and $5,000 each to premaster out-of-house), you'll wantto invest in PC-based premastering equipment to do the job in-house.andP;  Thepremastering process translates your application into the industry-standardHigh Sierra or ISO 9660 format on a nine-track tape.andP;  The production housepresses your CDs from this tape.andM;Two leading premastering systems, Meridian Data's CD Publisher Model S andReference Technology's CD-Simulator, cost $25,000 and $30,000, respectively.andO;Both include a nine-track tape drive and a 600MB (expandable) hard disk thatcan connect to virtually any PC through a SCSI interface.andP;  In both systems,premastering a 650MB application takes about two hours.andP;  Anyone who has asolid grasp of DOS can manage the menu-driven software that directs theprocess.andM;Besides reducing costs, PC-based premastering equipment lets you simulate howyour application will work before you have it pressed into CDs--important forcompanies that write or port their applications from mainframes andminicomputers, since retrieval times in CD-ROM can be slower than on largersystems.andP;  Simulation lets you avoid pressing a test CD, which can costthousands of dollars and take weeks to produce.andM;&quot;Your beta testers can work directly from the software before a single CD isproduced,&quot; says Monica Meyer, a spokesperson for Meridian.andP;  This method cutsproduction time and helps you examine the accuracy and thoroughness of yourindex and the look and feel of the interface.andM;What Commercial CDandM;Applications Are Available?andM;Microsoft Bookshelf:  Designed to show off CD-ROM's capabilities, thisreference library (which includes a dictionary, thesaurus, zip code guide,world almanac, style and usage manual, spell-checker, book of quotations, andstandard forms and letters directory) also shows, at times, how a clumsy userinterface can make a CD-ROM harder to use than the book (or, in this case,books) on which it is based.andP;
