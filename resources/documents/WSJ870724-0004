The 37 offices of Freedom Savings andamp; Loan Association, a state-chartered stock association that held assets of $1.9 billion, are to reopen today as a newly chartered federal mutual association using the same name.    The Bank Board attributed Freedom's failure to excessive operating expenses, imprudent operating practices and conflicts of interest in its lending practices.    The new thrift will have a seven-member board, selected by the Bank Board. It will be operated by The First, an Orlando, Fla.-based thrift, under a management contract with the Bank Board.    Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said small banks were closed yesterday in Oklahoma and California and their assets transferred to other institutions. They were the 101st and 102nd banks to fail this year -- the 15th in Oklahoma and the fourth in California.    Farmers andamp; Merchants Bank, Eufala, Okla., which had assets of $14.4 million, was closed by state authorities and will reopen today as a branch of Citizens National Bank andamp; Trust, Muskogee, Okla. Bank of Los Gatos, Los Gatos, Calif., was closed by the office of the Comptroller of the Currency and will reopen as a branch of Bank of the West, San Francisco. The Los Gatos bank had assets of $11.4 million. </TEXT></DOC>
