The greatmajority of this comprises bio-energy (290 PJ), much of this in the formof fuelwood used in rural and peri-urban areas. Solar, hydro and windenergy currently contribute only negligible amounts to energy consumption,yet Southern Africa is richly endowed with renewable energy resources.Total solar radiation reaching South Africa amounts to 2, 8 x 10/sup14/ Watts, or more than 10,000 times the total installed capacity ofexisting power stations. Conservative estimates indicate that the hydro-electricpotential of central and southern Africa is 70,000 MW. The potentialcontribution of these energy sources is thus substantial. Since fossiland nuclear fuels will inevitably be exhausted, renewable energy sourceswill sooner or later have to be relied on. But the development of economicallyviable renewable energy technologies has often been inhibited by a misallocationof research and development funding resources. Renewables currently receiveonly 0.1% that spent on the research and development of nuclear energyin South Africa. The urgency of developing viable renewable energy technologiesis most apparent when the energy problems of underdeveloped areas areconsidered. Serious environmental, social, and economic costs may bemitigated by the timeous exploring of appropriate long term solutionsbased on the use of renewable energy resources. Extending the grid isextremely costly, and it is in off-grid areas that the use of renewableenergy technologies is becoming economically attractive. A concentratedresearch and development factor aimed at this sector will ultimatelyprovide knowledge and experience of relevance to the long term energyneeds of the country.</TEXT></DOC>
