Milken.   Ueberroth, the ex-baseball commissioner, told reporters at aThursday news conference to announce the deal with Eastern parentTexas Air Corp. that Milken called him two weeks earlier andoffered constructive ideas on how to proceed.   He did not specify what those ideas were but quoted Milken asstrongly advising him to ``focus on the jobs.''   Ueberroth also put in a good word for Drexel, the nation'sfifth-largest investment banking firm that has played crucial rolesin some of the biggest takeovers of the decade.   ``Maybe some of you don't want to here this but I think it'sessential,'' Ueberroth said. ``The company _ Texas Air, not us _retained Drexel Burnham Lambert and they have been helpful in thistransaction on the company side and will be, overall, helpful tocomplete the transaction.''   Under the arrangement outlined by Ueberroth and Texas Air,Drexel will provide $300 million in debt-financing for the deal,which has been valued at $464 million.   Drexel and Milken have been battling negative publicity sincethey were implicated in wide-ranging securities fraud bynow-imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky more than two years ago.   Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six fraud felony charges inDecember, and a grand jury indicted Milken and two others on fraudand racketeering charges March 29. Milken has asserted innocence.   Steven Anreder, a spokesman for Drexel, said he was unaware ofUeberroth's remarks and could not comment further. Officials atRobinson Lake Lerer and Montgomery, the public relations firm hiredby Milken to speak for him, would not comment.   Eastern's employees struck March 4 after a prolonged feud withTexas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo, whom they accused of strippingthe airline's assets, eliminating jobs and scheming to crush theunions.   Eastern sought bankruptcy refuge March 9 and Lorenzo peddled itfor sale.</TEXT></DOC>
