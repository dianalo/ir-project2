Bell Atlantic Corp., one of the regional operating companiesspun off in the breakup of the Bell System nearly five years ago,said its profit rose 6 percent.   ATandamp;T said its net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $587million, or 55 cents per share, up from $505 million, or 47 centsper share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 3.2 percentto $8.75 billion from $8.47 billion.   ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen attributed the results to``double-digit growth in product sales and an increase inlong-distance revenues.''   Product sales for the quarter rose 12.4 percent and sales ofservices increased by 2.2 percent. Rental revenues, which accountfor less than 10 percent of total revenues, declined.   Staff redeployment to sales positions and a hiring halt alsohelped bolster the latest results, ATandamp;T said. The hiring halt,announced in July, reduced the work force by 4,000 to 311,000 as ofSept. 30.   For the first nine months of the year, earnings were up 8.2percent to $1.67 billion, or $1.56 per share, compared with $1.55billion, or $1.42 per share, in 1987. Revenue increased 3.4 percentto $25.85 billion from $24.99 billion.   ATandamp;T noted its plan, announced earlier, to lower interstatelong-distance prices by $697 million on Dec. 1. It also said it wasstepping up its shift to a digital telephone network, which couldresult in faster depreciation of old analog equipment and relatedfacilities.   That process could affect future earnings since the equipmentand plant have book value of $4 billion to $5 billion, but ATandamp;Tsaid it could not estimate the impact until further study wascompleted later this year.   Bell Atlantic said its net profit totaled $341 million, or $1.72a share, in the quarter, compared with earnings of $321.8 million,or $1.62 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased to $2.61billion from $2.59 billion.   For the nine months, earnings increased 6 percent to $1.01billion, or $5.12 a share, compared with $955.4 million, or $4.80 ashare, in 1987. Revenue was unchanged at $7.7 billion.   Bell Atlantic, which is based in Philadelphia, attributed itsresults to increased sales, efficiency and growth in the regionaleconomy. The company serves six Eastern states and the District ofColumbia.   The company said its increased business was attributed to lowerrates for local and toll services and reduced charges for access tolong-distance companies.</TEXT></DOC>
