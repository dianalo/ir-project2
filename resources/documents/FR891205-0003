Cecil, AerospaceEngineer, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, ANM-120L, FAA, NorthwestMountain Region, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806;telephone (213) 988-5322.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On October 12, 1985, the FAA issuedAD 85-19-02, Amendment 39-5136 (50 FR 36046; September 5, 1985), to requireinspection of the left- and right-hand window belt panels for cracks oncertain McDonnell Douglas DC-9-10, -20, -30, -40, -50, -80 series aircraftand C-9 (Military) series airplanes. That action was prompted by reportsof cracks in the window belt panel. The cracks were attributed to metalfatigue. This condition, if not corrected, could lead to rapid depressurizationand result in severe structural damage to the airplane.Since issuance of that AD, a 17.75-inch crack of a window belt panel wasdiscovered on a Model DC-9-32 series airplane, fuselage number 469, duringroutine maintenance activity.The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Service Bulletin A53-142,Revision 8, dated October 25, 1989, which describes procedures for eddycurrent inspection and repair, as necessary, of the window belt panelsabove and below the passenger compartment windows.This revision of the service bulletin segregates the affected airplanesinto two groups: Group I includes airplanes with line numbers 1 through950; Group II includes airplanes with line numbers 951 through 1157. Eachgroup was manufactured using a different type of aluminum having differentfatigue characteristics; the material used in the (earlier-produced) GroupI airplanes is less ductile than that used in the (later-produced) GroupII airplanes. Therefore, the service bulletin specifies different repetitiveinspection intervals for the two groups of airplanes.The revised service bulletin also describes procedures for a modification,consisting of an exterior window belt doublers installation, which, ifinstalled, would constitute terminating action for the repetitive inspections.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design, this AD supersedes AD 85-19-02 to require eddy currentinspections to detect cracks of the window belt panels at more frequentrepetitive intervals for Group I airplanes than previously required bythe existing AD; this AD extends the repetitive inspection intervals forGroup II airplanes. The inspections and necessary repairs are requiredto be accomplished in accordance with the revised service bulletin describedabove.Additionally, this rule removes all references to the use of ``later FAA-approvedrevisions of the applicable service bulletin,'' in order to be consistentwith FAA policy in that regard. The FAA has determined that this changewill not increase the economic burden on any operator, since later revisionsof the service bulletin may be approved as an alternate means of compliancewith this amendment, as provided by paragraph H.The FAA has determined that long term continued operational safety willbe better assured by actual modification of the airframe to remove thesource of the problem, rather than by repetitive inspections. Therefore,the FAA has issued additional rulemaking which proposes to require operatorsto accomplish the modifications identified in paragraph C. and D. of thisAD and, thus, terminate the repetitive inspection requirement. The proposedrule, contained in Docket 89-NM-197-AD (54 FR 39408; September 26, 1989),is a result of the recommendations of the Aging Aircraft Task Force, sponsoredby the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the Aerospace IndustriesAssociation (AIA), and the FAA; it proposes the installation of numerousterminating modifications related to a number of service bulletins applicableto Model DC-9 series airplanes.Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291.It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediately tocorrect an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If it is determinedtha this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOTRegulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation willbe prepared and placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluationis not required). A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the RulesDocket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
