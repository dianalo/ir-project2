The real battle was alwaysincomparably larger. The real battle was joined four yearsago with the nomination of Robert Bork. To Clarence Thomasgoes the victory that Robert Bork was denied. It's notpossible to understand what we've been through the past weekwithout remembering that earlier struggle.   In &quot;The Tempting of America,&quot; his account of the issuesthat drove the order of battle in his confirmation fight,Judge Bork wrote: &quot;Because of my writings I had becomeperhaps the most visible proponent of adhering to what theConstitution actually says and of pointing out that where theConstitution is silent, the people must decide throughlegislation. That view is anathema to liberals who have cometo view the courts as the branch that will enact theirpolicies when legislatures won't. Quite aside from the effectof my vote on the Court, I was a symbol that they needed todestroy.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Excepting the differences one would expect amongindependent thinkers, Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork are cutfrom the same judicial cloth. And so he too was a symbol thathad to be destroyed.   The attack on Clarence Thomas, which boggled tens ofmillions of viewing Americans, makes sense only if oneunderstands that the roots of the struggle extend back to1980 and Ronald Reagan's election to the presidency. One ofthe most persistent arguments of those who opposed the Reaganera was that it was a fluke, that he was simply not electedPresident because people agreed with his conservativepolitical philosophy. Believing this to be true, opponents ofthe Reagan presidency then argued that his nomination of thelike-minded Judge Bork was also illegitimate. As they put it,&quot;out of the mainstream.&quot;   We have argued continuously during these years that thisargument was false, that the voters had indeed entrustedRonald Reagan with a mandate (his campaign positions wereclear) and that the losing side was trying to overturn theresults of these elections.   With the televised Thomas hearings we have in effect justheld another national election. And the public, by everymeasure available, gave Judge Thomas what in a normalelection would be called their landslide support.   This doesn't mean that the American people support JudgeThomas -- or Robert Bork or Ronald Reagan -- in every detailof their political beliefs. It is likely even that on theabortion issue, most voters are essentially pro-choice. Wedon't doubt, however, that in terms of the presidency or theSupreme Court, voters are willing to risk disappointment ondiscrete issues if they approve the fundamental direction.They have now given their consent in three successivepresidential elections to a direction that can fairly becalled conservative. The Supreme Court nominations of GeorgeBush comport with those results.   The difference, however, between the American people andthe permanent political establishment in Washington is thatWashington no longer feels constrained by the Americanpolitical system. It won't wait for the next election, nor --more importantly -- will it make the effort to persuade theelectorate to support its views of Supreme Court nominations.   They'd rather fight their battles inside the Beltway,which lets them operate free of input from this nation's hugeelectorate. They can't possibly have wanted the sexualharassment charge against Clarence Thomas to go before theentire American population. It did, and they were undone by asystem that they made.   That system has depended crucially on the support of anideologically compliant Washington press corps, which wouldnormally render a target politically controversial and, in arisk-averse town, untouchable. Cut off from their supportbase, Judge Bork, Ed Meese, Oliver North and others have beenleft bleeding on the Washington fields. With Judge Thomas,however, the system ran out of control.   Washington's reporters, who had already largely brokenaway from the editorial controls of traditional journalism,even broke away from the congressional staffs andspecial-interest groups, building the sexual harassment storyinto a bonfire of personal and political grievances. Theyseemed to be demanding a national referendum on sexualharassment, meaning a Senate vote for the accuser, andinstead the whole nation showed up and a big majority votedthe other way -- to support Clarence Thomas. Perhaps thevoters felt they couldn't trust Washington or Congress withsomething important.   Now, with Clarence Thomas heading for the Court and thevoters going back to their daily lives, what has beenlearned?   The Democratic Party has to decide whether its future lieswith the world view of the special-interest groups andanonymous congressional staff, or with people such as BillClinton, Doug Wilder, Paul Tsongas and others, mostlybeyond-the-Beltway governors, trying to conform the party'shistoric ideals to the temper of the modern electorate.   The congressional and White House Republicans should havelearned that in a period of divided government, they can onlywin, as here, by abandoning their traditional passivity infavor of going on the offensive, and without apology.   Black Americans have perhaps the greatest sorting out todo. The bonfire illuminated the existence of an impressive,moderate black middleclass. If there is a group of truepolitical independents in this country, they are it. It looksas if they have a lot to say to Democrats, Republicans andwhite feminists. They should stick around and keep talking.   As for Clarence Thomas, we don't agree that he joins theCourt in a damaged state. This country is in the middle of ahistoric political turning. There was no reason to expectthat the overturning of the old order would be quiet or easy.But history will note that at the moment Clarence Thomas wasabout to be destroyed by the old order, the American peoplecame forward and by the millions confirmed his appointment tothe Supreme Court. It looks to us as if Clarence Thomas isthe first Justice to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court with apopular mandate.</TEXT></DOC>
