Editsthereafter to conform</NOTE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A chemical factory explosion killed three peoplebut did not involve fuel for a new long-range nuclear missile, asthe Pentagon claimed, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.   Gennady I. Gerasimov said in a telephone interview that theexplosion occurred at 7:15 a.m. on May 12 at a chemical factory inPavlograd, about 500 miles southwest of Moscow in the Ukraine.   Three people at the plant were killed and five were hospitalizedwith injuries from the explosion, which occurred in a storage areafor industrial explosives, Gerasimov said.   Soviet media carried no reports about the explosion.   U.S. officials in Washington, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Tuesday the explosion shut down the only plant inthe Soviet Union that makes the main rocket motors for the newSS-24 intercontinental ballistic missile.   The Defense Department said in a statement Tuesday that theexplosion ``destroyed several buildings at a Soviet propellantplant in Pavlograd.''   Gerasimov said propellant was not involved in the explosion buthe said he did not know whether the plant produced rocket fuel.   Pavlograd, with a population of 122,000, is about 30 miles eastof the major industrial city of Dnepropetrovsk. Gerasimov said noevacuation of the area's residents was ordered after the explosion.   The Pentagon said of the explosion, ``Apparently, this willdelay Soviet solid-propellant missile programs.''   But Gerasimov said the explosion did not cause major damage.``It's not catastrophic,'' he said.   The SS-24 is a large 10-warhead weapon that can be launched fromeither underground silos or rail cars. The Soviets began deployingit just last year on rail cars. Fewer than a dozen are thought tohave been made operational to date.   The SS-24 is one of two ICBMs in the Soviet arsenal that aremobile. The other is the SS-25, which is carried on a trucklauncher. The United States has yet to deploy any mobile long-rangenuclear missiles, although the Reagan administration is pressingCongress to develop a rail launcher for the MX missile.   The accident at the Soviet plant occurred just 2{ weeks beforePresident Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev open asummit meeting in Moscow that is expected to focus on prospects foran arms accord that would reduce the number of long-range missilesin each nation's arsenal.   Reagan administration officials contacted by The AssociatedPress said it would probably take the Soviets at least six monthsto resume production of the missile.   ``This is their only production line for the SS-24 main rocketmotors,'' said one administration source. ``This is a severesetback, albeit temporary.   ``We estimate they could be back in production in six months.But in the meantime, it's a significant body blow to their ICBMprogram.''   The sources in Washington said they did know what caused theblast.   U.S. spy satellites detected the explosion on the night of May12, one U.S. source said.   The blast did not involve any nuclear warheads, another sourcesaid, ``but it sure tore that plant up.''   ``They've got a lot of rebuilding to do,'' the official added.   The sources said they did not know whether the plant, inassembling the main rocket motor for the SS-24, was handling theoxidizer ammonium perchlorate, a chemical manufactured in a Nevadaplant that was ripped apart by explosions earlier this month.   The plant, owned by the Pacific Engineering andamp; Production Co., isone of two in the United States that make a critical ingredient forthe solid rocket fuel that powers the space shuttle and variousAmerican military rockets. The Nevada site was flattened May 3 bytremendous explosions that killed two people and injured 300 others.</TEXT></DOC>
