Action against Janez Stanovnik should be taken by the nation'shighest ruling bodies, the collective federal presidency and theCommunist Party Presidium, said a statement from the BelgradeSocialist Alliance carried by the official news ageny Tanjug.   In remarks last Wednesday to the National Press Club inWashington, Stanovnik said protests inspired by inflation andSerbian nationalism a month ago had threatened the stability ofYugoslavia.   Mass rallies in Serbia, the nation's largest republic, involvedhundreds of thousands of people supporting Serbian party chiefSlobodan Milosevic's campaign for more control over Kosovo andVojvodina, two largely autonomous provinces that are part of Serbia.   The Belgrade Socialist Alliance, which is strongly influenced byMilosevic's policies, said Stanovnik misinformed the American publicand his views ``differed from reality.'' Belgrade is the capital ofboth Serbia and Yugoslavia.   Stanovnik said in Washington the possibility of ethnicdisturbances crossing into the republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, afragile mixture of Moslem, Catholic and Christian Orthodox faiths,prompted him and leaders of other republics to act through thenational party on matters normally reserved for regional authorities.   He said the crisis had been eased by events that includeddecisions by the national Communist Party Central Committee latelast month.   ``Two weeks ago, you would have asked, `When does the civil warcome?'' Stanovnik said in the United States. He had gone there on aprivate visit to his son in Philadelphia.   A critical commentary published Sunday by the Belgrade dailyPolitika, which is controlled by Milosevic's group, said Stanovnik``disinformed the international public about events in his owncountry, frightening it with imaginary Serbian nationalism.''   Tanjug quoted the Belgrade Socialist Alliance as saying it woulddemand that ``the presidency of Yugoslavia and the Communist PartyPresidium adopt an official stand on the statements made by thePresident of Slovenia Janez Stanovnik in the United States.''</TEXT></DOC>
