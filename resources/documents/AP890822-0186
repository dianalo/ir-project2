Schmitz, the fraternity's executive vice president. ``We havetried numerous programs to eradicate it from the fraternity, but sofar none have accomplished the task.''   Legislation banning pledging was passed by undergraduatedelegates from the fraternity's more than 280 chapters during the45th national convention here last weekend.   Instead of a pledge period, new TKE recruits will be initiatedimmediately. TKE has more than 177,000 initiated members and 16,000active undergraduate members.   Last week, Zeta Beta Tau announced that it was eliminating thetraditional pledge period.   Pledging evolved in the late 19th century and was meant to be arite of passage for new recruits before their initiation as fullmembers. It has come under fire recently after scattered deaths offreshmen pledges in initiation rites that have included heavydrinking and humiliation.   Eileen Stevens, founder of the New York-based Committee to HaltUseless College Killings, spoke to delegates during the conventionand urged them to ban pledging.   ``More than 50 students have died from hazing incidents duringthe last 10 years. Whenever you have a two-tiered system where thereare members and pledges, the opportunity for hazing exists,'' saidStevens, whose son died in a hazing incident.</TEXT></DOC>
