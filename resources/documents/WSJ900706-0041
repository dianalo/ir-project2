The pair had considered becoming ad industryconsultants, Mr. Bannister said, but &quot;you don't only want tomake the bullets. You want to fire them as well.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Robert Louis-Dreyfus, Saatchi's new chief executiveofficer, fired the two men after attempting to demote them byslashing their corporate responsibilities. Messrs. Bannisterand Warman were expected to receive contract settlements ofroughly #1.25 million ($2.22 million) apiece that also wouldexclude them from the British advertising industry for fouryears. Each was earning about #345,000 a year beforeSaatchi's directors voted them a 10% pay cut earlier thisyear. Each executive had almost four years left on afive-year contract.   Mr. Bannister said the two now hope to complete asettlement with Saatchi by the end of July giving them thefreedom to operate an agency. They likely will receivesmaller severance packages, continue as Saatchi consultantsand accept fairly loose limits on recruiting Saatchi clientsand staffers. &quot;We are moving forward with an agreement inprinciple with the company that's now being crafted by thelawyers,&quot; Mr. Bannister said.   The accord would prevent the ex-Saatchi executives fromsoliciting any current Saatchi advertising business &quot;that wehave been in charge of and highly influential over,&quot; he said.That prohibition might cover only parts of the world-wideSaatchi empire, Mr. Bannister noted. And it wouldn't preventSaatchi clients from switching as long as the pair didn'tactively recruit them.   Indeed, similar restrictions didn't stop one Saatchiclient from awarding an approximately #1.25 million accountyesterday to a breakaway shop formed in May by seven formerofficials of Saatchi's flagship London advertising agency.Reckitt andamp; Colman PLC, a British consumer-products concern,said it chose Cowan, Kemsley, Taylor Ltd. to handleeverything but media buying for its U.K. household-cleanerbrand Dettox.   In the same way, any new agency created by Messrs. Warmanand Bannister might lure unhappy staffers from Saatchi'sLondon agency, Britain's largest, which they once ran.&quot;There's always the threat that other disaffected peoplewithin Saatchi might find the opportunity {attractive} ofjoining Roy and Terry in a new agency {rather} than toughingit out at Charlotte Street,&quot; the London agency's nickname,suggested David Forster, an advertising analyst at U.K.brokers Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. &quot;There's adanger that {Saatchi} would lose people as well as business.&quot;   A Saatchi spokesman said the company continues tonegotiate a severance package with Messrs. Warman andBannister, but declined to comment about details. He alsodismissed the loss of the Dettox account, saying, &quot;it's notterribly significant anyway.&quot;   ---   Boyle Brands Moved                                                                                                          Reckitt andamp; Colman, following its acquisition of AmericanHome Products's Boyle Midway unit, pulled its newly acquiredbrands from Young andamp; Rubicam and McCann-Erickson and placedthem at a number of smaller shops.   Wayne, N.J.-based Reckitt andamp; Colman, a unit of Reckitt andamp;Colman PLC, said its ad budget, which includes a number ofbrands that aren't switching agencies, totals more than $40million. A spokesman refused to say how much the brands it ismoving will bill separately.   TBWA Advertising was perhaps the biggest winner, pickingup the Woolite and Neet brands. According to Leading NationalAdvertisers, a tracking firm, Woolite billed about $13million last year; Neet billed about $2 million.   Bloom Agency, a unit of Bloom Cos., picked up Easy Offoven cleaner, which spent about $3 million in 1989, and twoother small brands. Campbell-Mithun-Esty, a unit of Saatchi andamp;Saatchi, won Wizard air fresheners; Partners andamp; Shevack pickedup the Holiday insecticide line.   Bloom, C-M-E and Partners andamp; Shevack already handle otherReckitt andamp; Colman accounts. The company spokesman said thechanges reflected a desire to consolidate its advertising atfewer shops.   McCann-Erickson, an Interpublic Group agency, had Easy Offand also a large chunk of the Woolite business. Young andamp;Rubicam had part of the Woolite account, as well as Neet,Wizard and a number of other small brands. It continues tohandle American Home's Pam and Butter Buds brands.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
