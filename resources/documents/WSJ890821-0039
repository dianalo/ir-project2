The tip line, Traders andamp; Investors Alert, based in Fort Lee, N.J., is run by a 46-year-old former insurance broker and publicist, Barry K. Davis, who has run afoul of regulators in the past. The Securities and Exchange Commission in 1971 (when Mr. Davis was known as Barry K. Sutz) barred him from the securities industry, including giving one-on-one investment advice.    In the past few weeks, comments carried by the call-in phone service, which claims nearly 2,000 subscribers, may have caused dozens of stocks to move -- including Johnson Controls Inc., Sunstrand Corp., Philip Morris Cos., Reebok International Ltd., Burnup andamp; Sims Inc., Whitman Corp., Masstor Systems and Columbia Gas System Inc. The service consists of recorded phone messages updated three times daily and a more-expensive beeper service for additional tips. Critics say it could be a vehicle for stock manipulators.    Oddly, many of the people that seem to be calling the tip line are Wall Street brokers, hungry for stock tips they say aren't available from their own research departments. The development hasn't pleased brokerage-firm officials.    Although Mr. Davis denies any improprieties, an official of the New Jersey Bureau of Securities says an investigation of him and the service is under way. &quot;We have put Traders andamp; Investors on notice that they appear to be operating as an unregistered investment adviser,&quot; says Richard Barry, supervisor of enforcement with the New Jersey agency.    Meanwhile, the SEC, which is aware of the Traders andamp; Investors line and the growing attention being given to it, declines to comment on whether it's investigating.    Mr. Davis maintains that he doesn't offer investment advice to Traders andamp; Investors subscribers. But it's his recorded voice telling clients a stock looks attractive or should be sold, and it's Mr. Davis on the phone speaking directly with subscribers, stockbrokers and sources on the floor of the exchanges, and using associates to relay comments to others.    Most of the information is obtained from stockbrokers who pass along research from their own firms, sometimes in exchange for free beepers or discounted subscription rates. This has angered a number of Wall Street firms, which call it an unauthorized use of their research.    &quot;We consider our research to be proprietary and for the use of our clients and not for this service to redisseminate and charge people money for,&quot; a spokesman for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. says.    He says Morgan Stanley has instructed employees &quot;not to talk to (the service) or to disseminate information to them.&quot; Employees who do are subject to disciplinary action, he adds.    Traders andamp; Investors continues to quote Morgan Stanley research.    Bruce Horowitz, who describes himself as a consultant to Traders andamp; Investors, says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. brokers constitute the single largest block of subscribers (about 45). He claims Shearson reimburses its brokers for the cost of the service, something a senior Shearson executive denies.    &quot;Shearson in no way is going to step up and pay for something like this,&quot; says Hardwick Simmons, Shearson's head of retail-brokerage operations. But Mr. Simmons says there's no policy banning the service systemwide because &quot;we couldn't possibly enforce it.&quot;    Employees at Wall Street firms including Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., Cowen andamp; Co., Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., Oppenheimer andamp; Co., PaineWebber Inc., Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., Salomon Brothers Inc. and Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. also appear on the Traders andamp; Investors subscribers list, Mr. Horowitz says.    John L. Steffens, head of Merrill Lynch's brokerage operations, says of Traders andamp; Investors: &quot;We would have a policy against it. We would not pay for it.&quot;    Mr. Steffens says Merrill brokers should give advice based on Merrill research and investment strategy. &quot;Our research has to be the basis for their recommendations,&quot; he says. But, he adds, &quot;we can't stop them from listening. They can call all they want.&quot;    A Dean Witter spokesman agrees it's difficult to keep brokers from using services like Traders andamp; Investors, but he frowns on it.    &quot;We have no policy against our brokers making phone calls, but we strongly recommend they get their information from professionals, not pundits,&quot; the spokesman says. &quot;The best place to get information on the markets is from our 50 analysts. There should be plenty of good ideas from Dean Witter.&quot;    And some traders and arbitragers say they prefer the more traditional circuit, where rumors traveled from trading desk to trading desk. &quot;I liked the old way because you knew who was saying what and you could judge it within a context,&quot; says one trader. &quot;The hotline has centralized the rumor circuit.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
