The East German Labor Ministry reported Friday thatunemployment levels nearly doubled since June despite $7billion in subsidies to troubled companies in July alone.Economic experts believe three million East Germans could beunemployed by autumn, or more than a third of the work force.</LP><TEXT>   Farmer and labor-union protests are growing, hundreds ofcompanies are going bankrupt, foreign investment remains lowand the overall financial burden of unification -- vastlyunderestimated by the two governments -- has become apolitical danger to Mr. Kohl that grows with each additionalweek before elections.   East Germany's woes could result in widespread streetprotests during the campaign and growing financial pressureon Mr. Kohl to raise West German taxes. Mr. Kohl has promisedto avoid raising taxes, although he retreated from that vowin a television interview yesterday. Partially in response tothis bleak economic outlook, East German Prime MinisterLothar de Maiziere proposed the stepped-up election plan thatwould require his parliament to approve unification shortlybefore all-German elections on Oct. 14. Currently, theelections are set for Dec. 2.   The plan was agreed to early last week during secretmeetings between Mr. de Maiziere and Mr. Kohl in Austria,where the chancellor was vacationing. Both leaders have beenworking increasingly closely and will be campaigning for acommon Christian Democratic party.   Mr. de Maiziere argued that a more rapid unification wasneeded to give investors and East Germans &quot;political clarityand thus economic security.&quot; However, his opponents believehe is merely acting quickly before voters feel the entireburden of unification. &quot;The sooner the vote, the better theChristian Democrats' chances of victory,&quot; says BaerbelBohley, a member of the New Forum, the major force behinddemonstrations against East Germany's communist regime lastyear. &quot;They want a vote before individuals feel the socialeffects of economic and monetary union on their own skin.&quot;   Social Democratic candidate Oscar Lafontaine, whoseelectoral chances sank further with the prospect of earlyelections, charged Mr. Kohl with &quot;transparent manipulation.&quot;His party will fight the plan when parliament returns earlyfrom vacation this week to discuss an election treaty withEast Germany. The Social Democrats won't question EastGermany's right to unify with West Germany in October.   Even the Soviet Union, which recently cleared obstacles tounification, reacted with unhappiness to the de Maiziere-Kohlproposal. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskykh saidhis government expected unification to come in an orderlyfashion only after completion of the &quot;two-plus-four talks&quot;between the two Germanys and the four World War II victorsand after the 35-nation Conference on Security andCooperation in Europe gives unification its blessing. Mr.Kohl said Friday he hopes to bring two-plus-four talks to aclose in Moscow in September.   The two sides have also agreed that Berlin would becomethe &quot;capital city,&quot; but the &quot;seat of government&quot; could onlybe decided by the parliament elected during all-Germanballoting.   Mr. Kohl's government has exacerbated the governmentalcrisis in East Berlin that gave rise to the call for earlierelections by rejecting increased financial requests from theEast German government, funds Bonn will sooner or later haveto invest in the country anyway. West Germany already plansto spend $16 billion to cover the East German budget deficitthis year, but East Berlin's government last week said itwould need a further $7 billion.   Bonn government officials have argued against giving moremoney to East Germany until their institutions have moreinfluence on how funds are used. They also say the low levelof foreign investment in East Germany is partially the resultof continued legal and other uncertainties that unificationwill do much to erase.</TEXT></DOC>
