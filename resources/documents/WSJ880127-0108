Mr. Nixon: &quot;Are you running for something?&quot; Mr. Rather: &quot;No, sir, Mr. President, are you?&quot; Ever since the wild days of Watergate, it has been a cardinal rule of media performance that it is virtually impossible for an on-camera interviewer to be too tough on politicians or even the President. Male or female, it hardly matters; everyone's a tough guy. And they're never tougher than when they sense that the establishment has reached a consensus that a public figure or a public issue, such as Iran-Contra or the Bork nomination, has lost support. Then anyone's free to take a shot.    Today, however, Dan Rather must have some sense of what Larry Holmes felt in the second minute of round four the other night when something heavy and unexpected landed on his forehead: &quot;How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?&quot; Mr. Rather blinked, took an eight-count and finished on his feet but it was clear to many in the audience that they'd just seen something extraordinary: A national politician had summoned the courage and the will to verbally punch out a network anchorman.    We've long wondered when something like the Rather-Bush exchange was going to happen. Politicians are constantly complaining about the power of the media, but why, we've thought, don't these guys push back occasionally? Politicians seem to have become convinced (or the media professionals have told them) that they have to grin and take it.    No better example exists of failing to blow the whistle on these media pile-ons than Ed Meese's initial Iran-Contra news conference in November 1986. Mr. Meese virtually apologized that the subject had ever arisen, and ended up ratifying a hostile media consensus that some vague, criminal behavior lay buried in these events. The Reagan administration began the Iran-Contra battle flat on its back, never recovered, and now we find George Bush confronted with Dan Rather's when-did-you-stop-beating-your-wife interview.    Sam Donaldson, who has made a specialty of using public figures like a personal speed-bag, says Dan Rather's performance was arrogant. So now there will be the usual, vast media self-examination over whether Dan Rather went too far. That will miss the point. This incident highlights the confusion in some of the press over its proper role.    At times, it seemed that Mr. Rather wasn't trying to find out the facts, the journalist's job, so much as construct a prosecutor's brief. Mr. Rather started with a lengthy report, complete with graphics flipping through legal-style filing folders, agitating the view that Mr. Bush knew more than he admits, or should have, or both.    Mr. Rather said that an Israeli official told Mr. Bush about arms-for-hostages in 1986; Mr. Bush corrected him that this is when he learned of Israel's deal with Iran. Mr. Rather suggested that Felix Rodriguez told Mr. Bush of the Contra diversion; Mr. Bush said at least CBS could have noted that Mr. Rodriguez swore under oath that he had not. And so on.    RATHER: You also said that you did not know . . .    BUSH: (interrupting) May I answer that?    RATHER: That wasn't a question. It was a statement. May I ask a question about . . .    Don't get us wrong; it was great entertainment. But if for the next 11 months debate over the presidency and public policy is going to take a back seat every night to People's Court interrogations or ruminations about character, maybe we should just turn over the coverage of Campaign '88 to Judge Wapner and Dr. Ruth. </TEXT></DOC>
