Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told the Senate BankingCommittee that at the very least, the Sandamp;L cleanup willrequire nearly $80 billion to get through the fiscal year.The administration plans to recoup $50 billion of that amountthrough the sales of assets of failed thrifts.</LP><TEXT>   But Mr. Brady pushed for Congress to simply approve allSandamp;L spending that the Treasury deems necessary. Late lastyear, a funding standoff between the administration andCongress halted the cleanup for three months, adding $300million or more to the cost of merging or closing insolventSandamp;Ls. &quot;I am afraid that if the Congress imposes on itself theburden of repeated votes on funding, the result will be . . .further delays, substantial additional costs to thetaxpayers, and confusion and fear in the minds ofdepositors,&quot; Mr. Brady said.   Congress is likely to consider this year's funding in thenext few weeks, but Democrats made it clear that they plan todole out further funds on a limited basis, in order to exertcontrol over the $200 billion cleanup. &quot;Many members haveserious doubts&quot; about the pace and structure of the Sandamp;Lcleanup, said committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.).&quot;I think it would be inappropriate for this committee toprovide long-term funding until it has examined those issuesin depth.&quot;   The downward spiral in real estate values is complicatingthe Sandamp;L cleanup. Real estate represents about 11% of the $146billion in failed thrift assets the government must sell, buttens of billions of dollars more is held in loans secured byreal estate.   &quot;I believe we are in a free fall of real estate values,&quot;said Robert Larson, a director of the Oversight Board of theResolution Trust Corp. and chief executive of Taubman Co., areal estate development firm in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.Except for the Mideast war, he said, &quot;it's the most importantsingle issue facing Congress.&quot;   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan cited aworrisome new trend in real estate appraisals, whichestimates worth based on liquidation values, or what theproperties would bring that day in a fire sale. &quot;We are goingto create a problem where one does not yet exist,&quot; he said.   Mr. Greenspan said that residential real estate hasn'tdeclined &quot;significantly&quot; nationwide, but commercialproperties have taken a much harder fall. He added thatcommercial properties are a crucial part of the nation'sgross assets, and that other lending depends on how thoseproperties are valued.   He didn't need to argue those points with the committee.Sen. Christopher Dodd, (D., Conn.) pleaded with regulators toease up in examinations of Northeast financial institutions.&quot;We are hemorrhaging badly, badly in New England,&quot; he said.&quot;It's going to spread over to the rest of the economy.&quot;   Separately, the Treasury said it's launching a study ofthe insurance industry. The study, a response tocongressional concern about the industry's recent declininghealth, will also focus on its state-by-state regulatorystructure. Several members of Congress have said they plan topush for federal regulation of insurance companies, and anend of their exemption from antitrust laws. In a letter toSen. Riegle, Mr. Brady said he should know soon how much timethe study will require.</TEXT></DOC>
