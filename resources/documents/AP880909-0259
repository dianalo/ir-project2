On other exchanges, contracts for future delivery of preciousmetals, grains, soybeans, livestock and meat all finishedmoderately to sharply lower while stock-index futures advanced.   Crude oil futures had rallied Thursday, after hitting theirlowest levels in nearly two years, on unconfirmed rumors that thesecretariat of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countrieshad called a special meeting of the cartel's pricing committee.   Traders clung to expectations of such a meeting until Fridayafternoon, when new rumors surfaced that any meeting plans had beenvetoed by Saudi Arabia.   Panic selling ensued, with the contract for October delivery ofWest Texas Intermediate crude oil briefly touching $14.05 a barrelbefore rebounding to $14.18 at the close.   The contract had closed at $14.16 a barrel on Wednesday, thelowest price for near-month delivery since Oct. 29, 1986, when thenear-month contract closed at $13.73.   Reports that some OPEC members had produced crude oil in excessof their quotas last month were mainly responsible for the sharpdrop in prices earlier this week.   But Charles J. Maxwell, senior energy strategist with the NewYork brokerage house C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., citedfive factors underlying the bearish trend in the oil market.   The factors include the slow world economy; competition fromgas, coal, nuclear and other energy sources; increased oilproduction in Brazil, Oman, Egypt and other non-OPEC countries; thecontinuing trend toward energy conservation and discord within OPEC.   Maxwell said oil prices probably would continue to fall untilOPEC members agree to firm production limits.   ``If they are fearful enough and they decide to cut backproduction, I can see us muddling through with prices at $14 to $15a barrel while we work off inventories,'' he said.   ``The disaster theory is that we go down to $9 or $10 a barrel,which would force OPEC's hand and they would order productioncurbs. That would bring us up to $15 or $16 a barrel bymid-winter.''   West Texas Intermediate settled 30 cents to 51 cents lower withthe contract for delivery in October at $14.18 a barrel; heatingoil was .88 cent to 1.10 cents lower with October at 40.97 cents agallon; unleaded gasoline was .93 cent to 1.07 cents lower withOctober at 42.06 cents a gallon.   The inflation-sensitive precious-metals market fell sharply inreaction to the oil market's plunge after rallying earlier in theday in response to the government's report of a 0.6 percent rise inwholesale prices last month.   The rally ended when traders decided the rise in wholesaleprices was not as inflationary as it looked at first blush, saidJim Steel, metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.   Silver futures began falling at that point while gold andplatinum remained relatively firm, he said.   ``But when the energies fell and the dollar remained strong,there was no way that platinum and gold could resist,'' he said.``You could describe it as almost panic selling.''   Gold closed at its lowest level since April 1987, Steel said.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $11.20 to$11.70 lower with October at $525.80 a troy ounce.   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold was $7.70 to $8.70 lowerwith October at $423.10 a troy ounce; silver was 17.2 cents to 19.2cents lower with September at $6.44 a troy ounce.   Grain and soybean futures finished lower on the Chicago Board ofTrade on pre-weekend profit-taking ahead of Monday's governmentcrop production report, analysts said.   The grain markets were shaken by a prediction from respectedGrain analyst Conrad Leslie that the USDA will report littledrought damage to crops last month.   Wheat settled 3 cents to 7\ cents lower with September at $4 abushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4} cents lower with September at$2.85} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 5 cents lower with Septemberat $2.63 a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 16 cents lower withSeptember at $8.77{ a bushel.   Cattle futures moved sharply lower on the Chicago MercantileExchange on expectations of larger supplies and slack demand nextweek, analysts said. Pork futures fell in sympathy with the cattle.   Live cattle were .65 cent to 1.30 cents lower with October at69.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .93 cent lowerwith September at 79.77 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .25cent lower with October at 37.92 cents a pound; frozen pork bellieswere .18 cent lower to .25 cent higher with February at 47.30 centsa pound.
