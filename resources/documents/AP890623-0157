Houses were under water and people stranded in cars in Maryland,and evacuations were reported in Kentucky. The flooding also led tobridge inspections in New York and road closings in Pennsylvania,Virginia and West Virginia.   ``We had flash flooding in places we never had it before,'' saidCharles Brice, the county civil defense director in Oklahoma City.``We have never experienced this much rain all at once and then theground being saturated didn't help matters.''   Divers and lake patrol rangers searched a swollen centralOklahoma creek for a driver missing after up to 7 inches of rainfell in a few hours Thursday night. High waters forced at least 20families to leave their homes temporarily and standed many motorists.   ``We're getting the roads back in shape,'' Brice said. ``Wedidn't experience as much damage as first anticipated.'' He saidauthorities were still tallying the losses, including those at a daycare center whose roof collapsed two hours after the last of thechildren left.   The National Weather Service said June's rainfall total of 14.47inches already has broken the record for the most rainfall in anymonth in Oklahoma City.   Several western New York communities declared emergencies asraging creek waters fed by torrential rains swamped bridges,inundated roads, flooded hundreds of basements and forced theevacuation of dozens of people.   In Arcade, where 3.5 inches of rain fell late Thursday evening,Supervisor Howard Payne said the main street of the villagesoutheast of Buffalo had been under 3 feet of water.   Flood waters flowed through the Hummingbird Toy Co. in Arcade,carrying away 70,000 partly assembled yo-yos.   ``It's incredible. Yo-yos will be floating down the CattaraugusCreek into Lake Erie for the next month,'' said owner BradCountryman, who estimated losses at $200,000.   Residents of the Pittsburgh suburb of Etna pumped basements,scraped mud and cleared debris following Thursday's heavy rain, andacross the state in Chester County, there was flooding Friday alongstate Route 82.   A 22-year-old woman with cerebral palsy drowned in the basementof her home in Holland, just northeast of Philadelphia, on Thursdayafter 2{ feet of water seeped in and tipped her wheelchair, policesaid.   No injuries were reported among Philadelphia-area motoristsstranded in high water that disrupted the afternoon rush hourThursday for drivers and rail commuters. The SoutheasternPennsylvania Transportation Authority had to run buses to replacetrains shut down by flooding and power outages.   In east-central Alabama, authorities estimated at least $2million in damage from rain that flooded farmers' crops andinundated homes.
