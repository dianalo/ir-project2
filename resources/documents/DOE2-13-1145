<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-13-1145 </DOCNO><TEXT>The proposed action is the issuance of an operating license to the ToledoEdison Company and the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company for thestartup and operation of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1(the station) located near Port Clinton in Ottawa County, Ohio. The totalsite area is 954 acres of which 160 acres have been removed from productionof grain crops and converted to industrial use. Approximately 600 acresof the area is marshland which will be maintained as a wildlife refuge.The disturbance of the lake shore and lake bottom during constructionof the station water intake and discharge pipes resulted in temporaryturbidity, silting, and destruction of bottom organisms. Since completionof these activities, evidence of improvement in turbidity and transparencymeasurements, and the reestablishment of the bottom organism has beenobtained. The cooling tower blowdown and service water which the stationdischarges to Lake Erie, via a submerged jet, will be heated no morethan 20{degrees}F above the ambient lake water temperature. Althoughsome small fish and plankton in the discharge water plume will be disabledas a result of thermal shock, exposure to chlorine and buffeting, fewadult fish will be affected. The thermal plume resulting from the maximumthermal discharge is calculated to have an area of less than one acrewithin the 3{degrees}F isotherm (above lake ambient). Approximately 101miles of transmission lines have been constructed, primarily over existingfarmland, requiring about 1800 acres of land for the rights-of-way. Landuse will essentially be unchanged since only the land required for thebase of the towers is removed from production. Herbicides will not beused to maintain the rights-of-way. 14 figs., 34 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
