The deadline passed with no immediate word from thecaptors.   In Jerusalem, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel proposedtrading all his country's Shiite Moslem captives for all capturedIsraeli soldiers and foreign hostages held by Shiite groups inLebanon. Rabin made the proposal in an announcement broadcast onstate-run Israel radio.   Shiite groups in Lebanon are believed to hold three Israelisoldiers and 17 foreigners, including nine Americans. Israelisecurity sources estimate 50 to 60 Shiite Moslems from Lebanon areheld in Israeli prisons.   The group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed onEarth said it would kill ``proven spy'' Lt. Col. William R. Higginsat 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT), if Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid were not freed.   Government sources in Jerusalem have noted that Israel hasrepeatedly stated that it would not bow to such threats.   In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati condemnedboth the death threat and the kidnapping of Obeid.   ``We condemn the kidnapping of Sheik Obeid and we ask theinternational community to put pressure on the Zionist regime torelease him,'' Velayati told foreign reporters at a news conference.   ``The threat against Higgins has nothing to do with us. However,we condemn any kind of kidnapping or death threat,'' he added.   His comments came a day after another leading Iranian officialdefended the threat against Higgins.   Obeid is the reputed spiritual leader of the Shiite MoslemHezbollah militia in south Lebanon, the umbrella group for factionsbelieved to be holding 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon, nine of themAmericans.   Lebanese security sources and Israeli officials say Obeid playeda role in the kidnapping of Higgins last year, but Obeid denies it.   In Sunday's statement, which was delivered to a Western newsagency in Beirut, Higgins' captors said carrying out the deathsentence ``will be our first response to the stupid Israeliaggression and the flagrant American support that proves U.S.complicity in the crime.''   Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed mainstream Shiite Moslem Amalmilitia called a general strike in Lebanon today to protest Obeid'sabduction.   Businesses were closed throughout Moslem west Beirut and itsShiite-populated southern slums, as well as the cities of Sidon,Tyre, Nabatieh and Baalbek in south and east Lebanon.   In Jerusalem earlier in the day, Deputy Prime Minister ShimonPeres defended Israel's decision to abduct Obeid, whom Israeliofficials have accused of instigating attacks on Israel. Peres saidIsraeli officials hope he can be swapped for three Israeli soldiersmissing in Lebanon since 1986 and believed held by Hezbollah.   ``I think that anything that prevents terror attacks againstIsrael, the kidnapping of our soldiers, must be done within theconfines of law when there is a state of law,'' Peres said.   ``Unfortunately in the case of Lebanon, it is a wild country andIsrael must defend itself,'' he added.   Of the death threat, he said: ``This isn't the first time theyare threatening.''   He would not say what Israel's response to the death threatwould be. ``I am not willing to relate either to details or tothreats,'' Peres said.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III today condemned the threatto kill Higgins as ``outrageous, uncivilized, unconscionablebehavior.''   ``There really can be no explanation for it and no excuse forit,'' he told reporters in Paris as he headed into a second roundof meetings at an international conference on Cambodia.   The group holding Higgins said in a Dec. 12 statement that ithad sentenced the Marine to death and said he ``made fullconfessions about his espionage activities.''   On Sunday, the group's statement said ``we shall carry out byhanging the death sentence handed down against proven spy Higginsat exactly 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) Monday if Sheik Abdul Karim Obeidand his two brethren have not been freed by then.''   Israeli commandos stole into the southern Lebanese village ofJibchit early Friday, kidnapped Obeid from his apartment and flewhim to Israel in a helicopter.   His cousin, Ahmed Obeid, and a friend, Majid Fahs, also wereseized, Lebanese police said. A neighbor of Obeid's was shot todeath by troops when he opened his door during the kidnapping.   Israel described Ahmed Obeid and Majid Fahs as ``assistants'' ofObeid.   Higgins, 44, of Danville, Ky., was serving as head of anobserver group attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in southLebanon when he was seized Feb. 17, 1988. His captors accused himof spying for the CIA.   Sunday's typewritten Arabic statement was not accompanied by apicture of Higgins, the usual sign of authenticity. But it appearedtyped on the same machine and the same paper as earlier statements.   Israeli analysts today questioned whether Higgins was alivebefore Obeid was captured.   ``During the negotiations which are likely to open in the wakeof the kidnapping of Sheikh Obeid, Higgins' captors will have toprove he is indeed alive,'' military analyst Zeev Schiff wrote inthe daily Haaretz.   Obeid has denied involvement in Higgins' abduction or inHezbollah.   But Israeli sources say Obeid was involved in the operation tokidnap Higgins and held the Marine for a time in his home. Onesource said Obeid was expected to provide information on Higgins.   On Sunday, a leading Iranian official defended the threatagainst Higgins.   ``It is very natural that the Islamic clergy ... and militantgroups throughout the world will take action against the interestsof Israel and the United States,'' Iranian Interior Minister AliAkbar Mohtashemi told a news conference in Tehran. ``They will notallow them to live comfortably.''   He named pro-Iranian Hezbollah as one of the Moslem groups thatshould retaliate.   Asked about the fate of hostages in Lebanon, Mohtashemi said:``The issue of the hostages has no direct connection with us.''   An Iranian newspaper said Obeid's abduction jeopardized moves tofree the hostages. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He wasabducted March 16, 1985.   ``The Zionists have introduced a new threat to humanitarianefforts to release hostages in Lebanon,'' the Tehran Times said inan editorial Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
