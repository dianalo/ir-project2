As previously reported, Bank of Boston has been negotiating a debt-for-equity swap under which it would exchange part of its roughly $50 million in loans to the Philippines for local currency. Those funds would then be invested in Commercial Bank, which is owned by the Philippine government.    A Bank of Boston spokesman said the agreement is subject to numerous conditions, including approvals by Bank of Boston's directors and by U.S. regulatory authorities. </TEXT></DOC>
