Inspite of ideal separation processes hydrogen does not yield more caloriesthan were needed for its production; hydrogen treated with oxygen developsextreme, uncontrollable temperatures (some thousand degrees); at present,electrolysis is considered the only tolerably mature hydrogen/oxygenseparation procedure. However, hydrogen as an energy source offers advantagesas to its storage properties and low-loss great distance transport. Onlysolar cells which for example make sense in the sunny regions of Africa,are considered to make hydrogen production an economic solutions. Theconversion of hydrogen into methanol fuels seems to be of interest, too.Hot water could serve as an indirect storage medium for solar power.However, unless solar energy utilization will be acceptable from theeconomic point of view within the coming 15 years nuclear energy willgain in importance. Notwithstanding these facts the future prospectsof solar hydrogen production are considered positive. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
