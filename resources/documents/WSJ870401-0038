The futures surrendered much of their gains in the final minutes of trading following an announcement by Citibank that it was raising its prime lending rate to 7 3/4% from 7 1/2%. The unexpected news shocked stock-index futures traders into a flurry of last-minute selling, analysts said. Chase Manhattan later followed Citibank's move.    By the time the shouting stopped in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Sandamp;P 500 contract for June delivery closed 0.45 below the underlying cash index. The so-called fair value of the June contract is closer to 1.60 to 1.70 above the cash index, said Gerald Walsh, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The fair value is based on time remaining until expiration and traders' cost of funds, among other factors.    With such a difference between the contract's fair value and yesterday's close, arbitrage traders are likely this morning to sell the stocks in the index and buy the relatively undervalued stock-index futures, Mr. Walsh said. Arbitrage traders treat stocks and stock-index futures as essentially equivalent investments, since the contracts expire at the same price as the stock index.    In this kind of arbitrage trading the effect of buying the futures is more than offset by the selling in the stock market, which tends to pull futures down further.    At the Chicago Board of Trade, stock-index futures based on the Major Market Index of 20 blue-chip stocks also closed at a substantial discount to the value of the underlying stocks.    Prior to Citibank's announcement, the stock-index futures had rallied on renewed stability in foreign exchange markets and a rebound in Treasury bond futures prices.    The same factors buoyed New York Stock Exchange trading, which closed before Citibank's announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 26.28 at 2304.69.    Futures analysts were divided as to whether the stock and stock-index futures markets would resume their climb once the prime rate increases are digested by the markets, or whether a further correction is imminent.    In other futures markets yesterday:    COPPER: Prices plunged on technical factors and selling by commodity pools, analysts and traders said. Commodity pools are professionally managed investor funds. Much of the day's losses stemmed from long liquidation, or selling contracts to offset earlier purchases, traders said. Copper for May delivery, the most active contract on the Commodity Exchange in New York, fell 1.6 cents an ounce to 62.45 cents. Yesterday's declines occurred despite recent contractions in exchange and producer stockpiles, analysts noted. &quot;Fundamentals really didn't come into play today,&quot; a New York trader said. Still, some analysts said, dealer premiums, which recently widened to about four cents over the Comex price, have narrowed to a little more than three cents, indicating that the recent tightness in U.S. supplies has eased somewhat.    COFFEE: Prices dropped to their lowest levels in 5 1/2 years as prospects for the reimposition of export quotas faded. Selling was triggered by news that the International Coffee Organization's executive board, which began a scheduled three-day meeting yesterday in London, doesn't have discussion of quotas on its agenda, analysts said. Exporters, whose supplies are at a seasonal peak, have been holding off selling in the hope that quotas would be reinstituted. The ICO news may cause exporters &quot;to begin to sell more aggressively,&quot; said Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. The result, analysts generally agreed, would be greater pressure on prices. On the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York, the May contract fell 4.27 cents a pound to settle at $1.0004. Earlier in the day it briefly dipped to 99.90 cents. The last time coffee futures slipped below $1 was August 31, 1981, when the nearest-term contract settled at 99.90 cents. It recovered the next day.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork belly and hog futures are expected to open lower today in the wake of a bearish hog and pig report, released by the Agriculture Department after trading's close yesterday. The report shows that hog producers are in &quot;the throes of a major expansion,&quot; said Charles Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago. Mr. Levitt predicts that prices may fall their daily limits today. The 10-state report found that as of March 1, the total hog and pig population was 39.2 million, up 2% from the year-earlier total of 33.3 million. The breeding herd increased 6% to 5.2 million from 4.9 million. The number of breeding animals is crucial to the size of future herds. Farrowing, or birth, intentions for March through May are expected to increase 7% to 2.3 million, compared with 2.2 million a year ago.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Most prices may get a boost today from prospective planting figures released by the Agriculture Department after yesterday's close. The report found that farmers will be planting 12% less corn acreage this year, 10% less wheat acreage and 7% less soybean acreage. According to the report, average weather conditions will result in a crop smaller than expected consumption, said Ted Mao, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
