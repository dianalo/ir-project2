The Soviets released the boats after demanding North Korea takemeasures to prevent future fishing violations, the Japanese ForeignMinistry said.   The boats were heading toward the North Korean port of Hungnam,where they would be examined by Soviet inspectors to determine howmuch compensation the North Koreans would have to pay for theillegal fishing.   Tass said North Korea guaranteed payment of $3 million in bail,pending discussion of the incident.   In Moscow, the official Soviet news agency Tass said the ship'scaptains estimated their ships were carrying 500 tons of fish,worth about $8 million.   The ships have North Korean officers, but about three-quartersof their crews are Japanese. The Kyodo News Service reported inlate May that 10 North Korean ships were seized May 19-22, with 202crew members _ 140 of whom were Japanese.   The Japanese fishermen had been held since mid-May by theSoviets on Shikotan, a small island in the Kurile chain just offthe northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.   It is unclear when the vessels will be allowed to sail for Japan.   Japan's consul general in the Soviet port of Nakhodka stronglyprotested that the vessels were headed for North Korea and notJapan.   The foreign ministry had said earlier crewmen were afraid ofgoing to North Korea and wanted to return directly to Japan.Japanese coast guard vessels were dispatched to the area to try tomonitor the voyage.   Acting foreign ministry spokesman Shigeo Takenaka said NorthKorea promised to return the 169 Japanese fishermen ``withoutdelay'' after they arrived in Hungnam.   The seizure of the boats led to an unusual tug-of-war betweenthe Soviet Union, North Korea and Japan over fishing in salmon-richwaters off the Soviet coast.   It also accentuated tensions between Moscow and Communist NorthKorea. Those ties have been strained by a recent thaw in Sovietrelations with pro-Western South Korea.   Japan has a fishing agreement with the Soviet Union and there isa quota of salmon Japanese vessels can take from Soviet waters.   North Korea has no fishing quota agreement with the Soviet Unionbut its fishing vessels were sometimes permitted to fish for salmonin Soviet waters. Experts said the informal arrangement enticedJapanese operators to put their vessels under the North Korean flagand take more salmon than permitted under the Japan-Sovietagreement.   Japan and North Korea have no diplomatic relations and Japaneseauthorities are examining the ties between Japanese and NorthKorean fishing operations.   Officials at one of the companies that leased boats to the NorthKoreans said they were optimistic the vessels would soon return toJapan.   But a relative of Kazuo Yoshida, chief engineer aboard one ofthe boats, said: ``I cannot help but remember the case of theFujisan Maru.''   In 1983, two Japanese fishermen were arrested, tried forespionage and sentenced to 15 years in prison in North Korea afterJapan permitted the defection of a North Korean who had stowed awayon their boat, the Fujisan Maru.</TEXT></DOC>
