V.I. Lenin may have set himself the task of building a &quot;new Soviet man,&quot; but Mr. Gorbachev's goal is nothing less than to build a new image for the Soviets in America.    Mr. Gorbachev certainly gave his all to the effort, but the betting here is that he still hasn't made too much more progress than Lenin. Watching the Soviet p.r. blitz this week was like looking at one of those pictures with the subtle flaw. Everything appears all right, but there's still something odd about it. The Soviets may have mastered the medium this week, but their flaw is that they still don't understand the importance of the message.    Not that the Soviets' public diplomacy hasn't impressed, even swept away, many here this week. Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov deflected questions with the same relentless amiability of American spokesmen. Mr. Gerasimov even mastered the technique of the TV &quot;sound bite,&quot; sprinkling his remarks with wry one-liners sure to make the evening news.    A battalion of other Soviets -- some 20 briefers and 160 other &quot;experts&quot; and &quot;journalists&quot; -- were also on hand to hit the talk shows. On Monday, a local radio comedy show was satirizing Mr. Gorbachev (Question: Why are you still in Afghanistan? Answer: How about those Redskins!), but the next day a Soviet spokesman was there to hold forth on perestroika.    No Soviet pounded a shoe all week, and many listeners pronounced themselves pleased. John Denver, the musician and one of many &quot;intellectuals and artists&quot; invited to the Soviet Embassy to hear Mr. Gorbachev on Tuesday, enthused that the general secretary is &quot;really open to what is really going on in the world and the vision of us coming together to work together in the world.&quot; Yoko Ono flashed the peace sign, while an unidentified visitor approached Mr. Gorbachev and gave him a hug.    The Washington Post's Style section, the ultimate definer of the capital's moods, captured the euphoria by declaring Tuesday's state dinner &quot;The Night of the Peacemakers.&quot; (The only mystery is why the Post's headline writers just didn't go all the way and say, &quot;Blessed Are the Peacemakers.&quot;)    Even many realists were impressed. &quot;He's bolder&quot; than other Soviet leaders, says Sen. Alan Simpson, one of the congressional leaders who met Mr. Gorbachev Wednesday morning. &quot;He's looking ahead. He's not cowered, not battened down. . . . There's some self-criticism there. That's what impressed me.&quot;    The White House, of course, was also something of a co-conspirator in all the good feeling. More than one White House aide remarked on the bizarre sight of red Soviet flags decorating the White House complex, but there they were. And Vice President Bush took the opportunity to play the role of statesman, having breakfast with Mr. Gorbachev and inviting people from -- of all places -- New Hampshire and Iowa to join them.    It all might have gone off just as any other summit among friends if the Soviets hadn't been, well, Soviets. In inviting &quot;intellectuals and artists&quot; to the embassy Tuesday evening, for example, the Soviets couldn't resist inviting people they know to be sympathetic. Henry Kissinger, the lone hard-liner in the group, tried to slip quietly away afterward, but reporters caught him and he noted, generously, that Mr. Gorbachev's remarks had been better than those of his questioners.    Mr. Gorbachev sailed through that crowd, but he had trouble a night later when he addressed a more skeptical group, American editors and publishers. &quot;Is this an interview?&quot; he barked at one questioner. And when asked, even mildly, about human rights, he retreated into the familiar Soviet defense of accusing his questioner.    Then there is the Raisa Problem. Mrs. Gobachev tossed around barely concealed barbs as Nancy Reagan escorted her through the White House Wednesday. And Mrs. Reagan was reportedly already to have thought, from their previous meeting, that Mrs. Gorbachev was given entirely too much to pedantic Marxist lectures.    Like every previous Soviet leader, Mr. Gorbachev (and his wife, for that matter) so far still seems to believe his country's own propaganda -- or at least to believe he can't stray too far from that propaganda line. That may be what in the end really prevents him from persuading Americans that his glasnost is revolutionary. As people of conscience, Americans are unsuited to cynicism. They like to believe people really believe in peace and justice when they say they do. Yet Mr. Gorbachev represents a system that still demeans those, and so many other, Western ideals.    At the White House state dinner Tuesday night, American Sovietologist Dimitri Simes happened to speak with Alexander Yakovlev, the Soviet propaganda chief. Mr. Simes pointed out that the Soviets should be wary of the euphoria that this visit was creating in America, because it might turn with a vengeance if it went unfulfilled. Mr. Yakovlev disagreed. </TEXT></DOC>
