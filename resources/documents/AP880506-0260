With 606,000 people finding jobs, the number of unemployedAmericans fell by 191,000 to just over 6.6 million, shaving 0.2percentage point from March's 5.6 percent level.   A separate survey of business payrolls showed a gain of 175,000jobs in April, more than one-fourth of them on factory assemblylines in industries that have increased their exports in recentmonths.   The Labor Deparment's figures came one day after the nation'slargest retailers issued April sales figures that analystsdescribed as disappointing.   On Wall Street, stocks fell Thursday for the second consecutivesession as traders awaited today's report on April employment. TheDow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 16.08 points to closeat 2,020.23, following a 22.05-point retreat on Wednesday.   The sluggish April retail sales results were blamed on coolweather and the early arrival of Easter this year, which pushedspring shopping into March. Although several major retailersreported their sales rose during the month from a year earlier, thegains were deemed lackluster.   Jeffrey B. Edelman, a retail industry analyst with theinvestment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said the salesincreases were ``below expectations.''   ``Put it all together, it's a dismal picture,'' said LindaKristiansen, a retail industry analyst with the investment firmDean Witter Reynolds Inc.   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's largest retailer, said itsoverall sales rose 4.8 percent from April 1987, while sales fromstores open at least a year were up 2 percent for the month.   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 2.5 percent last month,but the so-called same-store sales fell 0.6 percent. Wal-MartStores Inc. said its overall sales climbed 32 percent in Aprilwhile same-store sales rose 12 percent.   J.C. Penney Co. Inc., which emphasizes its apparel lines, sawsales decline by 0.4 percent last month.
