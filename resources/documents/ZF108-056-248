Rosch'ssidebar, &quot;The 8-MHz Bus:  Time for a Change?&quot;, October 31, 1989, page 109.)andO;DataWorld is one, choosing instead to run at an accelerated 11 MHz.andP;  This cancause problems for older expansion cards, but will mean better I/Operformance with cards designed to be driven at this higher speed.andM;Despite the flood of products and the commodity pricing that increasedcompetition generally brings, these 33-MHz machines do not come cheap.andP;  The&quot;low-end&quot; prices range between $5,000 and $6,000, and you can easily tops$20,000 list prices for full-blown models from big-name vendors.andM;How much do you pay for this extra speed?andP;  Compare prices within a vendor's386 line.andP;  If you were to buy a 386 from Compaq with 2MB of memory, color VGAdisplay, and an 84MB hard disk, the list price would be $11,198 for the33-MHz model, $9,996 for the 25-MHz, and $7,996 for the 20-MHz version.andO;While there are some differences in the designs of these three models, the33-MHz machine still represents a whopping 40 percent price increase over the20 MHz and is 12 percent more expensive than the equivalent 25-MHz machine.andM;Toward the lower end of the list price scale, Austin Computer Systems offers33-MHz 386 computers with 1MB of RAM, color VGA, and a 110MB hard disk for$4,695 and 20-MHz models for $3,495.andP;  Like some other vendors, Austin hasdropped its 25-MHz model altogether, since the company feels that there isn'tenough room for two top-end machines in its product line.andP;  The price spreadfrom 20 MHz to 33 MHz is about the same in proportion to Compaq's prices: a34 percent increase.andP;  If these premiums seem a bit high, remember that on aprice-to-speed comparison, the 33s come out looking like good bargainscompared with their slower siblings.andM;PUBLIC ENEMY NO.andP;  1: THE FUTURE?andM;Understandably, many buyers are going to pause before they shell outtop-dollar prices for the thirty something speed crowd.andP;  Potential customersare likely to be concerned about what lies just over the horizon.andP;  Already wehave seen the first arrivals of 80486 systems and EISA bus machines.andP;  The 486holds forth the promise of still greater performance; despite its 25-MHzspeed, its high level of integration and self-contained cache mean that itshould outpace the faster 33-MHz 386 designs.andP;  And the EISA bus could meanaccess to new 32-bit expansion options in the future while still accomodatingthe existing 8-bit and 16-bit designs for now.andM;Worry not, however: even industry analaysts seem to agree that it will besome time before either of these developments will be much of a factor in themarketplace.andP;  Recently uncovered bugs in the 486 will be corrected by thetime this issue hits the street, but the production delay this will cause issure to put a hitch in delivery schedules.andP;  And compared with the jump from a25-MHz to a 33-MHz 386 motherboard, boah 486 and EISA motherboard designsrequire a lot of entirely new research and engineering.andP;  All of these factorsare likely to slow delivery of new machines, and it will probably take awhile before they reach the pseudocommodity status already reached by the33-MHz 386 machines reviewed here.andM;And more machines are announced every day.andP;  Models from American Mitac,Charles River, Precision Systems, Swan Technologies, Tandon, and WellsAmerican were not available at the time of this review.andP;  Arnet offers amultiuser system that is not a traditional DOS machine but can run DOSapplications by using Unix and Xenix.andP;  Reviews and features table columns forthis issue's gang of 22 machines are arranged in alphabetical order.andM;So if you need the power, now is a good time to grab it.andP;  These high-speedpower-houses have scrambled to the top of the heap and look as if they standa good chance of staying there for a while.andP;  It's crowded at the top, but fornow, the 33-MHz 386 remains King of the hill.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
