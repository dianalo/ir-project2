The news agency said Wednesday that cosmonauts Alexander Volkov,Sergei Krikalev and Valery Polyakov will return to Earth April 27,leaving the Mir station mothballed for only the second time sinceit was launched in 1986.   ``When three Soviet cosmonauts return back to Earth from theirorbiting station Mir in about a fortnight, the facility will beleft unmanned for several months due to delays with the preparationof two research modules,'' Deputy Flight Director Viktor Blagovtold Tass.   ``This is because without the two modules, which will make itpossible to conduct wide-ranging research, including studies in theinterest of the Soviet economy, there is little sense in keepingcosmonauts on the space station any further,'' Blagov told the newsagency.   Tass first announced Tuesday that the cosmonauts would returnand leave the station without a crew, but the report Wednesdaycontained the first explanation of why the project was beingsuspended.   Some speculated the suspension was for economic reasons. Themove was announced after critics called for deep cuts in spendingon the space program. The announcement also came shortly after theSoviets lost two probes to Mars at a cost of nearly $480 million.   The mothballing of Mir makes economic sense, Blagov said. Hesaid that expensive new equipment, both on the ground and on thespace station, was needed, as well as training of future cosmonauts.   ``It is fairly difficult to do this in the course of a mannedflight, so the adjournment will simplify many things,'' he said.   The move, also announced on the evening television news programVremya, effectively cancels the launch of cosmonauts AlexanderBalandin and Alexander Viktorenko scheduled for April 19.   The announcement coincided with Cosmonauts Day, the anniversaryof Yuri Gagarin's first manned space flight 28 years ago, which wasmarked Wednesday night with a seven-minute fireworks display thatlit up the sky over Moscow.   Blagov defended the cost of the space program.   ``We plan to promote space commercial services and have alreadybegun to do this. Of the 19 agreements signed by the Soviet spaceagency Glavkosmos with other countries and foreign firms, 10 havebeen carried out,'' he said.   Blagov admitted that the Soviet Union was not capitalizing onspace exploration. ``Soviet space technology is up to the highestworld standards, but industrial spin-offs are pitifully scanty asvery few of the space industry's achievements are turned over forcommercial use,'' he said.   Mir, which the Soviets have said is the first building block ofa permanently manned space station, has been mothballed only oncebefore, a seven-month period following the return to Earth of itsfirst inhabitants, Vladimir Solovev and Leonid Kizim, June 25,1986, after three months in space.   Since the arrival of cosmonauts Yuri Romanenko and AlexanderLaveikin in February 1987, the spacecraft has been manned.   On Dec. 20, cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov set aworld's record for space endurance, living aboard the Mir orbiterfor 365 days and 22 hours.   They were joined in the final months of their record-settingspace voyage by Polyakov, a physician who traveled to the Mirstation on Aug. 28 to monitor the effects of living in agravity-free environment for extended periods.   Titov and Manarov were replaced by Krikalev and Volkov. Polyakovstayed aboard the orbiter to continue experiments in space healthtechniques.</TEXT></DOC>
