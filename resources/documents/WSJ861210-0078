So Mr. Cazale, president of the French Corn Producer's Association, has sent information to 100,000 French opinion leaders describing the forthcoming battle for corn sales as between France's &quot;Yellow Dwarf&quot; and America's &quot;Green Giant.&quot; As food for thought, he enclosed some popping corn with each packet.    The Democrats' Senate victory, after all their talk during last fall's U.S. campaign of increasing protectionist trade barriers, has heightened world-wide concerns about access to American markets, but only up to a point.    The Japanese are very worried. The subject comes up almost daily in newspapers, and American businessmen are bombarded with questions. American Ambassador Mike Mansfield brings up the topic in speech after speech to Japanese business groups. His message: If they're so worried, the Japanese better open up their own markets.    Canada, which sends 78% of its exports to the U.S., is the nation most threatened by new protectionism. Trade Minister Pat Carney says U.S. efforts to impose import duties are &quot;a new growth industry.&quot;    In Brussels, Belgium, Willy de Clercq, the Common Market's counterpart to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, finds the election results worrisome. &quot;Why should they change their attitude after having won?&quot; he says of Democratic protectionists. But Malcolm Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy Research Center, a London think tank, thinks the U.S. bark is worse than its bite.    &quot;The U.S. has talked a hell of a sight more than it has done,&quot; he says. Others in Britain also are taking a relaxed wait-and-see attitude. &quot;My phone hasn't exactly been hot with members calling&quot; to express concern about U.S. protectionism, says Ian Henley of the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby.    One reason that Britain and the rest of Europe -- except for farmers -- can be more relaxed about U.S. intentions than other nations is that European and U.S. interests coincide more than they collide, economists say. From a manufacturer's perspective, Mr. Henley can say, &quot;The (protectionist) sentiments don't seem to affect the products of the U.K.&quot; With the notable exceptions of disputes over telecommunications equipment and subsidized European passenger aircraft construction, U.S.)European friction is essentially limited to longstanding and still growing battles over farm goods.    By contrast, in the past year alone, U.S. trade curbs have been imposed on Canadian products including carnations, softwood, gas and oil products, fresh fish and wood shingles. Trade Minister Carney says, &quot;Americans don't perceive themselves as being protectionist&quot; but the proliferation of actions against Canadian products has been accompanied by U.S. reluctance to accept verdicts when its interests don't win a trade case.    On softwood lumber, she says, &quot;We have seen that in graphic terms.&quot; Canada won the case in 1983, but since then faced a number of legislative initiatives and countervailing duties.    And, although most nations consider it premature to begin taking measures to prepare for a new U.S. protectionist surge, rhetoric is heating up. French Trade Minister Michel Noir has adopted a hard-nosed stance. Referring to the incoming U.S. Congress, Mr. Noir says France is &quot;on its guard against the disturbing tendency in some countries,&quot; and will retaliate with &quot;loyal firmness.&quot; He adds, however, that at the moment the Nobel prize for trade barriers must go to Japan.    That, of course, is a point on which most Americans would agree.    The Bank of Tokyo estimates that Japan's huge trade surplus will grow to $89.8 billion in the fiscal year ending next March, up from $61.6 billion a year earlier. And, the basic Japanese belief remains that the trade imbalance is caused, not by Japanese trade barriers, but by U.S. failure to correct its economy and U.S. companies' failure to compete. A top Japanese trade official says of U.S. industry: &quot;They have to change, but I don't want to lecture them. I don't want the Japanese to appear arrogant.&quot;    Makoto Kuroda, a vice minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, displayed this Japanese view of the bottom line at a reception to honor the sale of the millionth turbocharger for auto engines sold to Nissan Motor Co. by a division of Allied-Signal Inc. Mr. Kuroda told the mostly Japanese audience that the U.S. company's success &quot;proves there are no barriers to the Japanese automotive-parts markets.&quot;    That statement, a top U.S. Embassy official rose to say, simply isn't true.    But such U.S. statements don't have much impact in Tokyo, where growing numbers of influential Japanese are fed up with being told what to do. The mood, not just among nationalists who object to any slight against Japan, is hardening. One member of the national legislature said: &quot;We have drawn a white line in the sand and we refuse to be pulled over it.&quot;    So, if the U.S. has until now averted a trade war with Europe and faces more of the same struggles with Japan to close the giant trade gap, it is Canada and the nations most recently challenging for space in the international trading world who are most likely to feel the pain from new U.S. protectionist measures.    South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore are keeping their fingers crossed that protectionist rhetoric doesn't develop into legislative action.    Brazilian-U.S. trade tensions have been focused on a range of items including computers, orange-juice concentrate, steel products, crankshafts and cotton yarn. Alvaro Gurgel de Alencar, coordinator for international affairs at the Finance Ministry in Brasilia, calls the U.S. &quot;a protectionist country.&quot; He says Brazil faces more trade barriers in the U.S. than in the Common Market or Japan.    &quot;If you're small,&quot; he says, &quot;the U.S. doesn't bother you. But as soon as your exports grow in a sector, somebody files a petition (for protection).&quot; He says Brazil is concerned about the protectionist mood of the new Congress, but isn't planning any special measures to defend its interests.    In part, that's because Brazil sees trade as tied to its debt. To pay interest on its $105 billion foreign debt, Brazil argues that it must control its imports and increase its exports. Brazil sees the U.S. as hypocritical for refusing to link debt and trade questions.    Between the U.S. and Brazil, as in so many trading relationships around the world, there are barriers on both sides. While they attack protectionism in Washington, Brazilians are angry that Mr. Yeutter, the U.S. trade representative, recently called Brazil the world's most protectionist country. In an interview, central bank governor Fernao Bracher asked: &quot;What the hell does Mr. Clayton Yeutter mean by this?&quot;    What he means is that Brazil's economy is so closed that imports account for just 5.5% of Brazilian gross national product, the total value of the output of goods and services. U.S. officials didn't pay much attention to this 15 years ago, when Brazilian exports totaled $2 billion, but they find it unacceptable now that exports are $26 billion.    Whether the Democrats set out in January to make the U.S. more protectionist or not, trade negotiations will remain rancorous.    Canada and the U.S. have been seeking an end to charges and countercharges in the form of an overall free-trade treaty. But it's been a long time in process and however much one might agree with Canada's Miss Carney when she says, &quot;We need better rules of the road appropriate for such heavy two-way traffic,&quot; it isn't clear that such rules are attainable. </TEXT></DOC>
