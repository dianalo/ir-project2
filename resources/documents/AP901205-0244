(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Once considered river trash, thewhiskered catfish is turning up in avant-garde restaurants and onfast-food menus from coast to coast.   ``I eat in a lot of places around this country. ... Many of themnow have catfish on the menu,'' says Craig Claiborne, cookbookauthor and retired New York Times food editor.   Last year, sales of farm-raised catfish ranked the variety asone of the nation's top five seafoods, behind only tuna, shrimp,cod and Alaska pollock.   But despite its rising popularity, the boon predicted for theaquaculture industry in the 1960s hasn't fully come to pass.   ``The pie is getting larger, but the pieces are gettingsmaller,'' said Roger Barlow, catfish marketing director for theMississippi Department of Agriculture.   Nutritional value and the consistent taste brought byhigh-protein feed allowed the catfish industry to growdramatically, but that growth also brought more competition,especially in processing, Barlow said.   Catfish farmers also are facing rising costs, labor demands andsoftening sales.   Catfish farming started in Mississippi in 1966 with 40 acres.Now, the industry is the state's fourth leading agricultural crop,contributing more than $300 million to the state economy in 1989.   Many farmers in the Mississippi Delta region switched to catfishin the early 1980s because the traditional agriculture industry wasslumping. Aquaculture allowed them to use their land and skills andbrought new economic strength to the state.   The new industry also provided thousands of new jobs forunskilled and semiskilled workers idled when machinery replacedmany jobs throughout the Delta region.   The state's catfish industry now employs more than 6,000 people,with an annual payroll of more than $76 million, according to TheCatfish Institute in Belzoni, which is located in Humphreys County,``The Catfish Capital of the World.''   This year, catfish operations in the state will raise, harvestand process more than 380 million pounds of fresh catfish.   The fish is processed by 25 to 30 companies, most of which arein the state, including the nation's largest two.   But a glut in processing forced four processing plants to closein 1989-90, and many processors say they are pinched by higherprices they pay to farmers.   About 85 percent of the catfish supplied to processors inMississippi is produced by members of the Catfish BargainingAssociation, which fixes selling prices for processors. Processorsare paying farmers 80 cents a pound this year, compared to 71 or 72cents last year.   Some processors say this year's price is about 10 cents toohigh.   The nation's second-largest processor, Isola-based CountrySkillet Catfish Co., has even threatened to expand into farmingunless it can secure lower prices from farmers.   ``If we're faced with no option, we'll start farming,'' saidDick Stevens, Country Skillet's president. ``We can't afford to buyfish at what prices are today. We have to buy raw materialsrelevant to market prices.''   Country Skillet's retail sales and sales of live fish areslowing because of the higher prices, Stevens said.   ``I guess the farmers wanted to make a sackful of money,'' hesaid. ``Instead of creating a good situation, farmers have createda nightmare.''   Country Skillet, which is owned by food processing giant ConAgraInc. of Omaha, Neb., is among the major catfish processors in theDelta region rebelling against efforts by farmers to control theprice of whole fish.   But many processors are cooperatives of catfish growers, whobenefit from higher base prices.   Delta Pride Catfish Inc. of Indianola - the nation's largestcatfish processor - is owned by a 180-member farmer cooperative,and it supports fixed prices.   That hasn't stopped workers from the United Food and CommercialWorkers unions from going on strike at two Delta Pride plants.   The workers walked out Sept. 12 after turning down a contractproposal offering a 4.8 percent average wage increase in the firstyear and pay increases averaging 35 to 90 cents per hour over theremaining two years of the pact.   The workers, many of whom are unskilled or semiskilled blackwomen, say the raises are not enough. Negotiations are to resumeDec. 12.   The increased demand for catfish, due no doubt to its morerefined taste and image, is one of the best safeguards that theindustry will survive, Barlow said.   In years past, the fishy-tasting river variety of catfish werecaught with a cane pole with worm bait. They were cleaned, rolledin cornmeal and deep-fried, and usually served with hush puppies -small fried balls of cornmeal dough.   Now consumers can buy pond-fed catfish in grocery stores aswhole dressed fish, steaks, filets, strips and nuggets. Recipesoffer ways to poach, barbecue, broil, smoke, stir-fry, fry, bake,steam, braise, stew, blacken, saute or grill dishes.   ``French chefs I've talked with are fond of both the flavor andtexture of pond-raised catfish,'' Claiborne said.</TEXT></DOC>
