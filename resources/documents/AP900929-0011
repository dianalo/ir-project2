Neither candidate so far is using a TV ad attacking the other.   Democrat Bullock touts his record in state government, and GOPcandidate Rob Mosbacher Jr. pokes fun at his lack of nameidentification.   The Republican's 30-second spot features a line of folksmispronouncing his name - ``Messbacker ... Mossmacker ...Mossbicker ... Muckbacker.''   Interrupting now and then are the candidate and his children,chuckling and explaining: ``No, Mosbacher.''   ``Because of the nasty, negative natureof the campaigns throughthe summer on television by many of the candidates, we decided totry to do something a little different,'' said Mark Sanders,Mosbacher's press secretary.   The Mosbacher ad was the candidate's own idea, although someadvisers initially were skeptical, Sanders said.   Bullock, meanwhile, is emphasizing his accomplishments at thecomptroller's office, where he has served for five terms. Hiscommercials end by calling him ``an independent voice for Texas.''   ``He shakes up the bureaucrats, says no to special interests, noto high insurance rates and forces out-of-state corporations to paybillions in taxes,'' the ad says.</TEXT><BYLINE>---</BYLINE><HEAD>Rinfret Continues To Shake Up GOP</HEAD><DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y.

A top aide to Barrett quickly denied Friday that any such offerhad been made.   Rinfret strategist Eddie Mahe and campaign spokesman Ted Kavanauboth insisted that Barrett had offered to step down earlier thisweek, but was asked to stay on by Rinfret.   ``That is not true,'' said Barrett aide Elizabeth DelTortoangrily. ``Pat did not offer to resign.''   Rinfret, whose campaign tactics of late have been termed``bizarre'' by one former state GOP chairman, first mentioned theBarrett resignation offer during a flight to the Utica areaThursday.   During that flight, Rinfret also said he might seek the statechairmanship if he lost his bid to unseat Democratic Gov. MarioCuomo. A recent independent statewide poll showed Cuomo with amassive lead over Rinfret, a millionaire economist making his firstrun for public office.   ``I'm sure Pat Barrett will step aside for me,'' said Rinfret,adding later that Barrett ``hasn't been a leader.''   Barrett, a former head of the Avis car rental company, has saidpreviously that he has no intention of leaving the partychairmanship.</TEXT><BYLINE>---</BYLINE><HEAD>Environmental Group Says Helms Ad a Distortion</HEAD><DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C.
