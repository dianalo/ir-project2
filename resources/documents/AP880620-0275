On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mixed; oilfutures fell; precious metals were lower and stock-index futuresretreated.   In another signal of rising prices, the Commodity ResearchBureau's index of 21 industrial and agricultural commodities rose2.93 points to a four-year-high of 266.23.   Except for wheat, all grain and soybean futures on the ChicagoBoard of Trade shot up their daily allowable limits at the openingbell and didn't budge all day.   Whenever a futures contract's price moves its daily limit,trading ceases in that contract. The limit-up opening left onlywheat futures open for trading, which in turn left most traders``bored,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean WitterReynolds Inc.   ``I sat around and talked to people. I didn't do very much,'' hesaid.   Wheat futures were influenced less by the drought than corn,oats and soybeans because the winter wheat crop, which accounts for75 percent of U.S. production, is nearly finished growing and isbeing harvested.   Lespinasse said some private meteorologists had predicted lightrain for some parts of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio on Wednesday andThursday.   ``But that's not for certain, of course, and judging by the waythe market reacted, it's going to stay hot and dry,'' he said.``And as long as it's hot and dry, we'll keep going higher.''   After the close, the National Weather Service issued asix-to-10-day forecast predicting above-normal temperatures andbelow-normal rainfall for the Grain Belt in the first five days ofnext week.   The near-month soybean contract, for July delivery, settledabove $10 a bushel, an 11-year high. Soybeans reached an all-timehigh of $12.90 a bushel in June 1973.   Wheat futures are at their highest level in nearly seven years.Corn futures prices are at four-year highs.   The Board of Trade said the daily limit on corn futures wouldreturn to 10 cents a bushel on Tuesday. The limit was raised to 15cents for three days, ending Monday, after all three corn contractsfor 1988 delivery finished up the limit on two consecutive days.   Wheat settled 10 cents to 19} cents higher with the contract fordelivery in July at $4.01\ a bushel; corn was 15 cents higheracross the board with July at $3.24{ a bushel; oats were 10 centshigher across the board with July at $3.08 a bushel; soybeans were30 cents higher across the board with July at $10.01{ a bushel.   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, traders used the phrase ``adrought spread'' to describe Monday's pattern of widely mixedprices for future delivery of livestock and meat.   Most prices for summer and fall delivery moved lower inanticipation of increased supplies as higher feed prices andshrinking pasture land caused widespread slaughtering of animals,analysts said.   But prices for delivery in the winter and spring soared, some bytheir permissable limits, on expectations that over the long termthe drought-related herd liquidation will result in a sharp drop insupplies, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp.in Arlington Heights, Ill.   Live cattle were .25 cents lower to 1.50 cents higher with Juneat 70.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.50 cents lower to 1.22cents higher with August at 70.30 cents a pound; hogs were 1.27cents lower to 1.50 cents higher with June at 50.45 cents a pound;frozen pork bellies were 1.13 cents lower to 2 cents higher withJuly at 41.97 cents a pound.   Crude oil for near-month delivery on the New York MercantileExchange fell to $16 a barrel for the first time since March 16 dueto an abundance of available crude oil, said John Azarow, ananalyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 45 cents lower to 6cents higher with July at $16 a barrel; heating oil was .25 cent to.55 cent lower with July at 43.18 cents a gallon; unleaded gasolinewas .50 cent lower to .04 cent higher with July at 49.47 cents agallon.   Gold and silver futures slipped lower on the Commodity Exchangein New York in reaction to the drop in oil prices and the strengthof the dollar, analysts said.   Gold settled $3.80 lower across the board with August at $454.50a troy ounce; silver was 5.5 cents to 6 cents lower with July at$7.195 a troy ounce.   Stock-index futures dipped on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,where the contract for September delivery of the Standard andamp; Poor's500 index settled 1.25 points lower at 271.50.</TEXT></DOC>
