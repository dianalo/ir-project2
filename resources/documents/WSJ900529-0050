Thomas Hudecheck, a contractor inDownington, Pa., accepted a commercial roofing job, so theunion, which said he could only work on residentialbuildings, firebombed his office. Robert Kryszczak used twounion roofers for a warehouse repair job instead of the sixthat the union had demanded. So at the Bucks County, Pa.,jobsite one day, the shop steward beckoned to Mr. Kryszczakto join him on the warehouse roof.   Mr. Kryszczak climbed up a 40-foot ladder and wasconfronted by six men. &quot;We want six roofers on the job]&quot; onedemanded. Then, Mr. Kryszczak later testified in a federalcase, &quot;I received a bone-crushing blow to the left side of myface, which caught my jaw underneath and literally ripped itoff and rendered me semiconscious on the roof. I remembermore kicks to the head, and I started pleading to God for thekicking to stop, but it didn't.&quot; Mr. Kryszczak's jaw waswired shut for 12 weeks.</LP><TEXT>   But things have changed. Philadelphia's 1,500-memberRoofers Union Local 30/30b, once controlled by a Mafia-backedhoodlum who terrorized roofing contractors in Pennsylvania,southern New Jersey and Delaware, now is supervised by theU.S. government. The union local was declared a criminalenterprise, union officials went to prison, and people likeNicodemo (Little Nicky) Scarfo were replaced with aPhiladelphia lawyer named Robert Welsh Jr., who says, &quot;Theycan't write a check or hire a secretary without mysignature.&quot; The result, says Mr. Hudecheck: &quot;I don't have tolook over my shoulder anymore.&quot;   The U.S. takeover of Local 30/30b -- and of a New Yorkcement workers' union and a New Jersey Teamsters local -- areexamples of the government's most successful offensive everagainst the Mafia. Fourteen Mafia chieftains -- the heads ofnearly half the crime &quot;families&quot; in the nation -- are inprison, more than at any other time since the Mafia firstemerged as a nationwide crime syndicate in 1931.   Nor is the pressure easing. In March, the Mafia boss ofMassachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, RaymondPatriarca Jr., was indicted on racketeering and othercharges. &quot;There's no more hiding,&quot; complained Anthony F.(Guv) Guarnieri, a captain in Pennsylvania's Bufalino crimefamily. &quot;They can get us no matter where we go.&quot; He wasright: He was being secretly recorded at the time.   More witnesses are speaking up as the fear of retaliationeases, according to Mafia specialist G. Robert Blakey, a lawprofessor at Notre Dame University. &quot;As more bosses areprosecuted,&quot; he says, &quot;the notion that the Mafia isinvincible is seen as a myth.&quot;   The ebbing influence of the Mafia -- or La Cosa Nostra,the crime group established by Salvatore (Lucky) Luciano andstill supervised by a ruling council known as the Commission-- extends beyond its hobbled leadership cadre. In the pastfour years, the government has made significant inroads onanother front: ridding the marketplace of domination byMafia-infested unions. Using the broad powers of theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act,prosecutors are tackling labor racketeering with a dualthrust: filing criminal RICO charges against mob figures andcivil RICO actions against the unions themselves. That allowsjudges to appoint trustees to supervise the union and set thestage for free elections.   Since last year, three court-appointed overseers have beenpolicing the Mafia-linked International Brotherhood ofTeamsters. In February, the Justice Department zeroed in onwhat it describes as a Mafia stranglehold of the New York-NewJersey waterfront, the world's second biggest port. Throughcivil RICO, federal lawmen are seeking a court'sauthorization to police an entire marketplace by clampingtrusteeships on six local unions of the Mafia-linkedInternational Longshoremen's Association. The ILA locals, thegovernment asserts in a civil RICO case, are employed by theMafia for extortion and other crimes -- charges that thedefendants deny. &quot;There's a general malaise, if you will, inthe Cosa Nostra underworld,&quot; says Frederick T. Martens,executive director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission.   The news, of course, is not all good. John Gotti, reputedboss of the New York-based Gambino crime family, enjoys acharmed life. Three times in recent years, the &quot;dapper don&quot;has beat the rap, including his acquittal in February ofassault charges.   The Mafia still exerts control over legitimate businessesthrough as many as 400 individual local unions nationwide,law-enforcement officials estimate. Although they make upless than 1% of the total, these Mafia unions are oftenstrategically situated to shut down an entire industrythrough mob-directed work stoppages.   The Justice Department estimates income of all organizedcriminal groups at $100 billion a year. The Mafia has thelargest share, and the biggest chunk now comes from laborracketeering -- usually extortion of employers orembezzlement of union pension and welfare funds. The Mafiamaintains a strong presence in parts of the transportation,meat processing, waste disposal and construction industries.   And building RICO cases against union locals is tediousand often frustrating work. Years of entrenched mob influencecan't be obliterated with the stroke of a judge's pen. Still,as the following vignettes show, there is demonstrableprogress in the fight against the Mafia.                                                                                                          Philadelphia Roofers                                                                                                          Philadelphia's Roofers Union Local 30/30b has a history ofsporadic violence and corruption. In the 1980s it sank to newlows.   In late 1980, Local 30/30b's boss, John McCullough, wasmurdered in a Mafia hit. In the union power struggle thatfollowed, according to federal law enforcement officials,Philadelphia Mafia chieftain Nicodemo Scarfo threw hissupport to a McCullough functionary, Stephen Traitz Jr. Mr.Traitz, easily elected union leader, lost no time repayinghis powerful benefactor. He collected Mr. Scarfo's debts,gave jobs to Mr. Scarfo's people, and had his sons serve asMr. Scarfo's bodyguards. Mr. Scarfo won assurances from Mr.Traitz, an ex-boxer, that he wouldn't physically assaultroofing contractors friendly to the mob. Mr. Traitz alsoallowed some of these contractors to pay below-scale wages.   In return, Mr. Scarfo gave Mr. Traitz his blessing. As Mr.Traitz said in a recorded conversation, &quot;{Scarfo} says whatcan I do for you? I says . . . make sure everybody knows I'myour {expletive} guy. . . . If they know you're in back ofme, I'm un{expletive}beatable.&quot;   For a time, it seemed he was. Roofing contractors boughtlabor peace with &quot;initiation fees&quot; and other questionablepayments to the union. Those who challenged Local 30/30b evenin petty matters risked property destruction or assaults byunion goons weighing as much as 340 pounds. In a recordedconversation, Mr. Traitz boasted: &quot;I'm a fistfighter. I gotall fistfighters.&quot;   Money embezzled by union officials from a local 30/30bbenefit fund was used for payoffs to nearly 50Philadelphia-area public officials. Recipients of bribesincluded judges, policemen, prison officials, an employee ofthe Philadelphia district attorney's office and an officialof the Pennslyvania Department of Labor, according to federalJudge Louis C. Bechtle, who imposed the governmentsupervision on Local 30/30b.   Contractor Thomas Zimmerman tangled with Local 30/30b in1983 while serving on the board of a Philadelphia trade groupthat negotiates contracts with the union. After Mr. Zimmermanopposed the union twice on policy matters at board meetings,his veteran roofing employees were ousted by the union andreplaced with union-designated workers.   William Hargrove, a contractor in Camden, N.J., wasbeaten, his trucks were set afire and his repair work wasvandalized because he refused to dismiss his nonunion roofersand hire Local 30/30b workers, he said in an interview. AndMr. Hudecheck, whose office earlier had been firebombed, waslater beaten up in his office when the union accused him --falsely -- of hiring a nonunion employee.   Mr. Hudecheck, now a nonunion contractor, joined otherroofers in testifying in a civil RICO hearing. &quot;When theyasked us to cooperate, a lot of us were a little reluctant,&quot;he says. &quot;Anybody who cooperated faced retribution if nothingwas done to those in power.&quot;   Today, the Scarfo-Traitz alliance has ended. Last year Mr.Scarfo received life in prison for murder in a state case,and 55 years for racketeering in a federal case. Meantime, 13union officials and employees have been convicted under RICOof extortion, racketeering and other crimes. Mr. Traitz drewa 15-year prison sentence. Local 30/30b was declared acriminal enterprise by Judge Bechtle, who named Mr. Welsh tosupervise the union.   The situation &quot;has changed 180 degrees for the better,&quot;says Mr. Hargrove. &quot;We can operate without intimidation sincethe government has taken over.&quot; Since the federal crackdown,he also is winning back subcontracting business. &quot;Contractorshad second thoughts about hiring us a second time,&quot; Mr.Hargrove says. &quot;They feared they'd suffer retaliation fromthe roofers union. Now some of the guys who had stopped usingus are using us.&quot;   Says Mr. Hudecheck: &quot;The government did a thorough job.The intimidation is basically nonexistent now.&quot;   Mr. Zimmerman has operated as a nonunion contractor sincelast November, and says he has experienced no intimidation.Yet he is still shaken. &quot;The feds asked me if I wanted a gunpermit,&quot; he says. &quot;I said no, I'm no Wyatt Earp.&quot; Instead, hearmed himself with a mobile phone. &quot;I can punch in Welsh'snumber, and the Department of Labor. I take it to the roofwith me. That's my lifeline.&quot;   Mr. Welsh, the court-appointed officer of the union,agrees that there has been external progress. &quot;Instead ofviolence {against employers} or burning buildings,&quot; he says,&quot;now the union puts up picket lines, or files charges withthe National Labor Relations Board.&quot;   But, he cautions: &quot;In terms of internal democracy, I'm notencouraged. They have a long way to go in that area.&quot; Theroofers union elected officers last June in what Mr. Welshsays &quot;appeared to be a free election.&quot; But he says many ofthose elected had been associated with the Traitz group and&quot;haven't yet learned to permit dissenting opinion.&quot; Mr. Welshbelieves it could take more than five years before dissenterscan criticize the leadership without fear of reprisal.                                                                                                          N.Y. Concrete Workers                                                                                                          For the privilege of pouring the concrete foundations ofManhattan office and apartment buildings, contractorsregularly paid kickbacks to Ralph Scopo, a member of theColombo crime family and president of the New York DistrictCouncil of Cement and Concrete Workers Union, according totestimony in federal criminal cases in New York. CarloD'Arpino, a New Hyde Park, N.Y., contractor, testified in1985 that he gave $16,000 to the union leader during a periodof about two years. &quot;{Scopo} made it plain, if you want toexist and get by with no problem, this is the procedure,&quot; Mr.D'Arpino says in an interview.   Testimony in a 1987 federal criminal case showed that Mr.Scopo and the Colombo family extorted 1% of allconcrete-pouring contracts up to $2 million. In an intricatebid-rigging scheme, contracts exceeding $2 million wereallocated among roughly six Mafia-designated contractorsknown as &quot;the Club.&quot; Club members paid kickbacks of 2% oftheir contracts, and the payoffs were split among four NewYork crime families. Contracts above $15 million werereserved for Sandamp;A Concrete, in which Genovese crime familyboss Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno held a secret interest,according to the New York State Organized Crime Task Force.   Contractor Stanley Sternchos testified that his companywas excluded from the Club and thus could bid only on jobsunder $2 million. He also testified that he obtained somelarger contracts by paying Mr. Scopo personally $10,000 percontract. His company's total payments to the mob overseveral years totaled $800,000, he testified.   The FBI estimates that during the period of Mafia control,New York concrete companies overcharged builders by more than$40 million a year to offset their illegal payoffs. Prior toconstruction of Manhattan's Jacob K. Javits ConventionCenter, for example, engineers projected that the contractfor pouring concrete would be $18 million. Instead, Sandamp;AConcrete got the contract for $30.3 million.   The shakedown ring was smashed. Mr. Scopo and his Mafiabosses were sentenced under RICO in 1987 to 100-year prisonterms for extortion and other crimes. Then, in a civil RICOaction, the District Council and Local 6a of the Cement andConcrete Workers were placed under a court-appointed trustee.   Mr. Salerno, a member of the Mafia Commission, is inprison; Sandamp;A Concrete still operates, but under court-imposedtrusteeship.   Irving Fisher, chairman of HRH Construction, a major NewYork builder, estimates that the absence of competitionincreased developers' costs 20%. Since the federal crackdown,he says, &quot;there's no question in my mind there's morecompetition.&quot; Typically, he says, six or eight companies willbid on a job now, versus one or two in the past.   Though Mr. Scopo and some of his henchmen have been oustedfrom the union, other officials -- against whom no damagingevidence surfaced -- kept their jobs. Eugene Anderson, theNew York attorney who is the union trustee, says that theincumbents of Local 6a and the District are viewed by themembership as part of the old regime, whether or not such aview is justified. For whatever reason, the membershiprefused to challenge the incumbents in elections held in 1987-- a fact that Mr. Anderson calls his &quot;single biggestfrustration&quot; as trustee. New elections are scheduled for thisfall.                                                                                                          New Jersey Teamsters                                                                                                          For a quarter-century, Anthony (Tony Pro) Provenzano, acaptain of New York's Genovese crime family, bossed the7,800-member Teamster Local 560 in Union City, N.J. He diedin 1988 while serving a 20-year sentence for acceptingillegal payments from employers. Since 1986, the local hasoperated under a trusteeship, the first imposed on a unionunder RICO.   In an interview, the current trustee, Edwin H. Stier,relates an incident that occurred during Christmas 1987 toshow how deeply embedded union corruption was. A unionbusiness agent whom Mr. Stier had appointed paid a routinecall on an employer, whose warehousemen belong to Local 560.According to Mr. Stier, the employer asked the businessagent: &quot;Who do I make the payment to? Every Christmas I'msupposed to come up with $5,000.&quot;   &quot;The employer believed he was buying labor peace,&quot; Mr.Stier says. &quot;He didn't realize, until he was explicitly told,that the corruption was over.&quot;   During the Provenzano regime, two union dissidents weremurdered, union funds were misused, and former convicts wereput on the union payroll. Some employers paid union officersillegal kickbacks for &quot;sweetheart contracts&quot; that enabledthem to pay below-scale wages.   Robert Kortenhaus, an Elizabeth, N.J., trucking executiveand critic of the Provenzano regime, employs Teamster driverswho don't belong to Local 560. For a long time, he says, thisput him at a disadvantage: &quot;You can't compete when {Local560} negotiates $9 to $10 an hour, against your $14 an hour.&quot;Today, he says he's better off &quot;to the extent there's not allthese sweetheart deals going on with Local 560.&quot; Under thetrusteeship, &quot;employers have got somebody to go to. As longas the police are on the beat, we're in good shape. We neededan overseer. Now there's a feeling of honesty.&quot;   Union pension and welfare funds are now under the controlof the trustee, and the corruption alleged by the governmentis being rooted out. The cleanup not only frees more moneyfor actual benefits but also &quot;tends to slow down theacceleration rate in employer premiums,&quot; says John West,president of TNT Red Star Express in Newark.   In Teamster Local 560, the election for president in late1988 was the first under the trusteeship. Michael Sciarra, aformer 560 president, was the choice of the union'spro-Provenzano group. But the court removed him as acandidate after the Justice Department contended that heacted on the Genovese crime family's behalf even after thecourt declared the trusteeship. Mr. Sciarra has denied anywrongdoing.   Instead, his brother, Danny, was elected president by atwo-to-one margin and took over the union's day-to-dayoperations, as he was permitted to do under terms of thetrusteeship. He replaced the trustee-appointed businessagents with his own people, including his brother Michael.&quot;We're doing a good job here, and the members like us,&quot; DannySciarra says. &quot;The government don't belong here.&quot;   Some employers, too, are satisfied with the newleadership. &quot;I'd much rather deal with Sciarra's {businessagents} now than with the trustee's people,&quot; says BillClifford, the president of St. Johnsbury Trucking Co. &quot;TheSciarra people are more knowledgeable.&quot;   Mr. Stier, who, as trustee, retains control of Local 560'spension and welfare funds, says some people may bedisappointed by the election results. But he says the RICOtrusteeship has clearly had a positive effect. After all,&quot;this was the first contested election in 25 years.&quot;   What's more, the union's executive board recently askedMr. Stier -- to his surprise -- to become the permanent, paidoverseer of 560's pension and welfare funds after the uniontrusteeship expires. According to Mr. Stier, union officialstold him they wanted to protect the funds from racketeering.&quot;To me, this is a behavioral change since the trusteeship,&quot;Mr. Stier says. &quot;Regardless of motive, the executive boarddid make the offer. There's hope that this board, left to itsown devices, can run this union effectively without controlby organized crime.   But Mr. Stier cautions: &quot;It's a war of attrition. You'retrying to change values. The change will come about in smallincrements.&quot;   In the meantime, Michael Sciarra has been removed asbusiness agent effective May 31 under a preliminaryinjunction issued by Judge Dickinson Debevoise. The judge,ruling on a Justice Department request, found that MichaelSciarra's dominating presence inhibited the board from actingindependently.</TEXT></DOC>
