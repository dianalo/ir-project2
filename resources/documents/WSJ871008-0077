Although leveraged buy-outs are almost unheard of in the region, Prudential officials said the area's many medium-sized, family-owned companies offer fertile ground for highly geared acquisitions. But they said buy-outs can't flourish in the area without a private-placement market for the subordinated debt used to finance them.    Leveraged buy-outs involve the purchase of a company by management or outside investors using funds borrowed against the assets of the intended acquisition. Ultimately, the borrowings are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. In the U.S., such buy-outs have been financed largely through the issue of relatively high-risk, high-yield debt securities known as junk bonds.    Prudential Asia's chairman, Victor Fung, said the company intends to take the lead in introducing the acquisition technique to eastern Asia. He said the company wants to participate in buy-outs both as a financial adviser to the buyers and as a direct equity investor in the companies being acquired.    Since its establishment a year ago, Mr. Fung said, Prudential Asia has put together two such transactions. In December 1986, it led a group of outside investors in the purchase for 200 million Hong Kong dollars ($25.6 million) of Hong Kong's Dragon Seed Co. It also joined with a management group to acquire Simmons Japan Ltd., a bedding maker, for about four billion yen ($27.3 million). Mr. Fung said the Simmons acquisition was Japan's first leveraged buy-out.    Mr. Fung said Asia offers many excellent targets for leveraged buy-outs. After two or three generations, he said, ownership of many companies often is divided between family members who are active in management and others who are only passive investors. In many cases, he said, the managers want to expand the business internationally and increase their own control, and a management-led leveraged buyout is the ideal solution.    Mr. Fung added that Prudential defines buy-out targets as well-established concerns that could generate the cash flow needed to repay the debt assumed by the purchasers. He said the wave of leveraged buy-outs in the U.S. could create additional opportunities for highly geared acquisitions in Asia. When U.S. multinational companies have been acquired through leveraged buy-outs, he said, the new management often has needed to sell some of the company's international operations to finance the purchase. He noted that Simmons Japan came on the market when Wickes Cos. of the U.S. agreed to sell most of its Simmons bedding operation to closely held Wesray Capital Corp. and members of Simmons's management.    Prudential officials said the lack of a private-placement market for the unsecured, subordinated paper commonly used in buy-outs is a major factor inhibiting the widespread use of the technique in Asia. Prudential Asia's senior managing director, William Flanz, said the key to creating a regional market for subordinated debt is to show financial institutions, primarily in Japan, that they could safely achieve high yields through low-grade paper.    As an example, the Prudential director cited the yen-denominated paper issued this summer by the group that bought out Simmons Japan. He said the short-term notes would be refinanced later this year with a longer maturity and would carry a yield of as much as 8%. In contrast, he said, most yen-denominated corporate bonds currently offer yields of 5% or 6%.    &quot;Some sophisticated institutional investors have to come to an awareness that there is an opportunity in Asia for them to invest in high-yield securities where they can get a premium return either through high interest rates or an equity-conversion feature,&quot; Mr. Flanz said. To foster that awareness, he said, Prudential is discussing the private placement of Asian corporate debt with financial institutions based in Tokyo and Hong Kong.    Mr. Flanz said the company also is engaged in a project to sell the subordinated debt of U.S. corporations to Japanese institutions. He said that if these investors take an interest in low-grade paper from the U.S., it would be only &quot;a small step&quot; to interest them in similar securities issued by eastern Asian companies.    If institutional investors in Asia don't create a market in locally issued subordinated debt, U.S. investors eventually would move in, Mr. Flanz predicted. Meanwhile, Prudential Asia intends to continue pursuing leveraged buy-outs in the region with its own cash. Prudential Insurance has committed more than $100 million to the unit, and Mr. Flanz said that &quot;we have deep enough pockets to meet our own funding requirements.&quot;    He cautioned, however, not to expect an immediate surge in eastern Asian leveraged buy-outs. He said the transactions are extremely complicated and required a gestation period of at least six months. </TEXT></DOC>
