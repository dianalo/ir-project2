The nuclei /sup 185/Wand /sup 195/Pt are shown to represent the best empirical examples ofthe SU(3) and O(6) limits, respectively, and it is also shown that theConsistent Q Formalism can be extended to the odd A Hamiltonian to describethe transition between these two limits. Preliminary comparisons withthe low lying structure of the odd Os nuclei are presented. The questionof the empirical evidence for supersymmetry in this region is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
