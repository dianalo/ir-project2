We cannot afford the steady financialdrain.''   He said Eastern would concentrate on operating its mostprofitable routes _ its Northeast shuttle and flights between Miami,Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile.   Earlier, Eastern asked a federal judge to bar pilots from takingpart in the Machinists' strike and order them back to work.   Eastern filed the request with U.S. District Judge Edward B.Davis, who did not immediately schedule a hearing. The strike hasnearly shut down the airline, which says it had expected more pilotsto stay on the job.   The airline asked that the judge order the Air Line PilotsAssociation to cease ``any strike, any concerted refusal to reportto work, (or) disruptive behavior in any manner interfering with(Eastern's) normal operations.''   Eastern said the pilots, under the Railway Labor Act, mustcontinue negotiating a contract and may not strike until after anofficial 30-day cooling-off period, as the 8,500-member Machinistsunion had.   ``We knew that was coming,'' pilots spokesman Rick Chapman said.He said the pilots union attorneys would study the motion.   The pilots union contends it's not on strike but is merelyhonoring Machinists' picket lines.   The walkout crippled the airline's top-priority Northeast shuttlethis morning as the work week got under way, but a court orderprevented rush-hour chaos for a half-million rail commuters. Onweekdays, the lucrative and highly competitive hourly shuttle servesprimarily business travelers.   On Sunday, the airline told the pilots they were committing``economic suicide'' by honoring the Machinists' strike, which beganSaturday.   ``You can't fly without pilots,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matellsaid at a morning news briefing, before the lawsuit was filed.``It's an hour-by-hour evaluation.'' Snow in New York City delayedthe few flights that were ready.   Most of Eastern's 3,500 pilots and 5,900 flight attendantshonored the strike by the airline's 8,500 mechanics, baggagehandlers and ground crew. The strike began over Eastern's demand forcontract concessions and escalated a 17-month battle at the nation'sseventh-largest airline.   The effects of the strike could spread Tuesday if the nation'spilots followed their union's request to strictly observe aviationrules starting that day.   Only 92 of Eastern's 1,000 daily flights took off Sunday, saidMatell. The pilots' union put the figure at 68.   The sharp cuts in operations have stranded thousands of Eastern'susual 100,000 daily passengers at airports around the country.   Eastern is aiming at getting about 100 flights into the airtoday, focusing special attention on its hourly Northeast shuttleservice, Matell said. Eastern is awaiting federal approval to sellthe lucrative shuttle to developer Donald Trump.   As of 10 a.m. today, six out of the normal 16 shuttle flights hadgone out, Matell said.   ``Terrible weather has not helped,'' Matell said.   A morning snowfall in New York forced cancellation of severalEastern flights on the shuttle between Boston, New York andWashington. Before the snow began, Pan Am had announced it wasdoubling service on the same routes, but Eastern said it could notimmediately report the impact on its boardings.   Tim Cook, an Eastern spokesman in New York, said the man whousually tracked such figures was ``out throwing bags'' as airlinemanagers were pressed into airport duty.   The strike had threatened to spill over into a sympathy actiontoday against 12 commuter railroads around the country. TheMachinists called off their plans Sunday after a judge in New York,with its 320,000 railway commuters, issued a temporary order banningrailroad workers from honoring Eastern picket lines there.   The same judge signed an temporary order Monday barring unionizedAmtrak workers from staging a sympathy walkout until at least 3 p.m.Wednesday, when he will consider a longer-term stay.   No commuting problems were reported during the morning rush hourat New York or other cities that faced possible rail labor problems.But the union held out the possibility it would ask the railroadworkers to walk out if a planned appeal upheld the legality of sucha sympathy strikes.   In public appearances Sunday, Eastern President Phil Bakesadmitted that the carrier had miscalculated when it had assuredtravelers there would be no major disruptions.   Charles Bryan, negotiator for the Machinists', also apologizedfor the inconvenience to travelers, but added: ``This is probablythe purest classic case of evil vs. good that's been seen in thehistory of organized labor. ... These people were not workers whowere greedy or doing anything wrong.''   By honoring the pickets and virtually shutting down the carrier,pilots threatened Eastern's ``very existence,'' Matell said Sunday.   ``By continuing to stay out, the pilots are committing economicsuicide,'' he said.   The company late Sunday sent pilots a letter telling them toreturn to work before noon Tuesday or be classified as being onstrike. Pilots who are placed in that classification and later goback to work will be required to sign a ``preferential recalllist,'' according to the letter from Frank Causey, Eastern's chiefof pilot operations.   The wording appears to refer to last week's U.S. Supreme Courtruling that allowed Trans World Airways Inc. to reward flightattendants who crossed picket lines during a strike by moving themup the seniority list over attendants who refused to work.   Thousands of anxious passengers holding tickets on canceledEastern flights spent hours in lines that snaked around airportterminals, hoping to find seats on other airlines or get refunds.   ``I'm not flying this stinking airline again!'' yelled JohnVannua of New York's Long Island, who had been waiting three hoursat Miami International Airport to have his ticket validated foranother carrier.   Pickets chanted and baggage piled up at airports from San Juan,Puerto Rico, to Los Angeles and from Miami to New York. Some Easternplanes were stranded on Caribbean islands without crews, the companysaid.   Jesse Jackson joined pickets at Hartsfield Atlanta InternationalAirport today, and told them they should be allowed to take controlof the airline in an effort to save it. ``If Lorenzo can't fly it,let the workers buy it,'' Jackson told cheering strikers andsupporters.   In Washington, Air Line Pilots Association President Henry Duffysaid his union was asking all pilots nationwide to strictly followaviation rules starting Tuesday ``to ensure the safety of the (airtraffic) system,'' which he said had been weakened by the Easterndisruptions.   Duffy said the action would slow air traffic, but insisted thatwas not the intent.   Battered by years of labor tension and growing competition in thederegulated airline business, Eastern has racked up nearly $2.5billion in debt and claims daily losses of more than $1 million. Itwants $150 million in concessions from the International Associationof Machinists over four years; the union wants $50 million in raises.   Matell said his tough remarks were not a threat that pilots couldbe laid off. But Eastern may retaliate with firings. Frank Lorenzo,who controls Eastern through his giant Texas Air Corp. holdingcompany, sacked striking Continental Airlines employees in 1983 andput the carrier into bankruptcy.   Lorenzo is the main target of the strikers' anger. He is widelymistrusted by Eastern workers because of what they call histriumphant union-crushing campaign at sister carrier Continental.Many accuse him of provoking the strike to do the same at Eastern.</TEXT></DOC>
