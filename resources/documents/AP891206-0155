On Wednesday, the Liberal Democratic Party chief became thecountry's first non-Communist president.   In the anything goes world of East German politics, the61-year-old Gerlach was able to maneuver himself out from theCommunists' shadow into national prominence.   The Communists for decades counted four smaller parties as theirallies, among them Gerlach's Liberal Democrats. The ``nationalfront'' that bound them together routinely picked up more than 99percent of the vote in government-controlled elections.   The system gave the country at least an outward semblance ofdemocracy despite the hard-line leadership. In reality, theCommunist Party ran the show and no one challenged it.   That all changed on Oct. 7, as party chief Erich Honecker facedhuge street protests and heard a stern warning from visiting SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev that ``he who is late is punished.''   Less than two weeks later, the 77-year-old Honecker was out andhis protege Egon Krenz was in, this time with a vague promise offree elections.   Gerlach, a gray-haired, professorial-looking lawyer, quicklytook up the cause of free elections and other causes as well. Hedemanded an end to Communist monopoly on power and greater opennessin society. He insisted that officials look into why tens ofthousands of people were fleeing the country.   The three other parties _ Farmers Party, National Democrats, andChristian Democrats _ quickly joined in the calls for reform, butby then Gerlach was well out in front.   That seeming overnight conversion isn't without its detractors.   ``The four parties are acting as if they were seduced virginswho are now trying to run away from the big, bad Communist Party,''opposition leader Rainer Eppellmann said last month.   Still, Gerlach's composure and outspokenness won him supporters,as he appealed for greater tolerance and denounced anti-Semitism.   Gerlach told Parliament on Nov. 17 that his party was breakingfrom the Communist alliance and called for a ``true sharing ofpower'' in free voting.   But he also made it clear in a television interview that ``weare a party socialists in a socialist system.''   ``The task before us now is to define what socialism means andhow we can make it meet the needs of the people.''   The insider-turned-outsider saw his main wish come true lastFriday when the Communist-dominated parliament scrapped the party'sleading role in society.   Even within the fast-forward pace of change in East Europe, thatwas record time _ with the results due in part to Gerlach.   It has paid off. A public opinion poll conducted in East Germanyfor West Germany's Stern magazine says the Liberal Democrats wouldreach second place, behind the huge and sometimes unwieldy NewForum movement, if free elections were held today.   The Communists would be third, the poll said.   Despite the success, a somber Gerlach said he was ``not happy''about taking on the new duties as head of state.   Gerlach indicated he wouldn't actively seek to hold on to thejob when the parliament fills the presidency on a permanent basis _but it seemed certain that the equivalent of a ``draft'' would keephim on as president.   While the job's powers are limited, the East German presidentdoes represent the country on foreign visits. Gerlach's stature anddemeanor are probably just what's needed abroad for a country thathis allies, the Christian Democrats, say is reaching ``bananarepublic'' stage.   Gerlach had already been serving as the country's vicepresident, before Wednesday's vote. A Liberal Democrat since theend of the war, Gerlach also served as mayor of Leipzig in the1950s.   In addition to Gerlach, the parliament also has a non-Communistchief. Farmers Party chief Guenther Maleuda was elected speaker onNov. 13.</TEXT></DOC>
