<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-49-0041 </DOCNO><TEXT>There is an increasing consensus that MR imaging is superior to CT asa primary imaging technique for evaluation of the liver, especially metastaticdisease. T1-weighted spin-echo short TR/TE techniques, especially atintermediate field strengths, have already proved superior to contrast-enhancedCT in terms of sensitivity and specificity for liver lesion detectionand differential diagnosis. Theoretical, practical, and research topicsbased on a 3-year experience with clinical and research investigationsare discussed. Among the issues considered are the following: (1) Suppressionof biologic motions for upper abdominal scanning. (2) Theory and practiceof pulse sequence optimization for detecting liver metastases, emphasizingT1-weighted short TR/ TE techniques. (3) Comparison of MR imaging withCT for the detection and differentiation of liver lesions. The relativestrengths of MR imaging will be emphasized. (4) Differential diagnosisof liver lesions. Laboratory and clinical results with gadolinium (T1active) and ferrite particles (T2 active) will be reviewed. Pharmacokinetics,pulse sequence selection, and toxicity considerations will be stressed.(8) Miscellaneous conditions: venous patency (portal, inferior vena cava,hepatic), metabolic diseases; use of special techniques; surface coilsand nonferromagnetic aspiration biopsy needles.</TEXT></DOC>
