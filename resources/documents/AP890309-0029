President Corazon Aquino congratulated the armed forces and saidthe capture of former Lt. Col. Reynaldo Cabauatan after a two-yearmanhunt ``will lead to greater stability in this country.''   Brig. Gen. Pantaleon Dumlao said Cabauatan, who was wearingcivilian clothes and disguised with eyeglasses and a goatee, wasarrested by soldiers as he left a suburban Manila restaurant aftermidnight.   Dumlao said soldiers, tipped off earlier that Cabauatan would beat the restaurant, initially did not recognize the renegade officerwhen they arrived at the restaurant.   But Dumlao said one soldier saluted a bearded man who resembledCabauatan, and Cabauatan instinctively returned it, leading to hisarrest.   Cabauatan was taken to the Philippine Constabulary's Camp Crame,where authorities presented him briefly at a news conference. Nointerviews were allowed. Cabauatan shook his head no when reportersasked him to make a statement.   Cabauatan, 42, was the most prominent anti-Aquino military figurecaptured since the December 1987 arrest of former Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan, leader of the Aug. 28, 1987 coup attempt inwhich 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded.   Honasan escaped in April and remains at large.   Cabauatan was sought after a January 1987 coup attempt, whenrenegade soldiers stormed military and news media facilities in thecapital. The government called it an attempt to restore Marcos topower.   He also took part in an abortive coup at The Manila Hotel in July1986 and was linked to an attack on the stockade at Manila's FortBonifacio the following April.   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, head of the Philippines Constabulary,said the military had ``very strong indications that the money beingused by this group came from ex-President Marcos,'' who fled toexile in Hawaii after being ousted in a February 1986military-civilian uprising.   Cabauatan went underground after the January 1987 coup attempt.   He gave frequent clandestine news conferences to announce theorganization of the Nationalist Army of the Philippines to continuehis struggle against Mrs. Aquino.   Military officials said they were preparing several rebellioncharges against him in addition to the two existing mutiny cases.</TEXT></DOC>
