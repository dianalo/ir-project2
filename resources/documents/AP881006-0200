(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The day after an Energy Department draftreport sharply criticized Savannah River Plant management, thenuclear facility suffered an equipment failure that led to arelease of radioactive tritium gas.   The escape of less than .01 millirems of the gas into theatmosphere Thursday morning posed no threat to health, said plantspokeswoman Becky Craft. Workers at the plant, the nation's onlyproducer of weapons-grade plutonium and tritium, were notevacuated, and the mayor said, ``The town's not upset at all.''   ``The tritium ... was released into the atmosphere from thefacility's stack,'' a statement issued by the plant's managementsaid. ``The accidental release occurred as the result of equipmentfailure during routine operations inside the Tritium Facility.''   A millirem is a measure of radiation; a routine chest X-raytotals about 20 millirems, according to Ms. Craft.   The draft report criticized the Energy Department and its primecontractor at the plant, Du Pont, for poor staff training, poorcommunications and sloppy operating procedures that have underminedsafety.   The 50-page report made a host of recommendations, includingstepping up oversight so problems can be caught before they becomeserious.   In Washington, four senators Thursday asked an independentcommittee to review safety and operations at the plant in the wakeof disclosures that as many as 30 major mishaps over 30 years hadnot been reported to Energy Department headquarters or made public.   Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.; James McClure, R-Idaho; BennettJohnston, D-La., and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., called for aninvestigation by the Advisory Committee on Nuclear FacilitiesSafety, which was established by Energy Secretary John Herringtonto give independent assessments of operations at nuclear facilities.   The New York Times on Thursday reported that a study by aconsulting firm of the plant's operations from 1971-1987 showedthat chronic equipment failure and poor operating procedures causednuclear reactors to shut down unexpectedly nine to 12 times a yearfor nearly two decades.   That rate is twice that of the civilian nuclear power industry,and Richard W. Starostecki, the Energy Department's chief safetyoperator, told the newspaper that civilian reactors with the samenumber of forced shutdowns would have had their operating licensesrevoked.   At the Statehouse in Columbia, a dozen people held a two-hourvigil Thursday morning.   ``These types of mishaps are serious. It's scary to hear thatthey've had fuel melts,'' said Michael Lowe of the environmentalaction group Greenpeace. ``It's just poor, poor management. They'remanaging not only our lives, but our tax dollars.''   In contrast, the longtime mayor of Aiken said, ``I'm not at allconcerned about the townspeople's safety'' because of the plant.``It's been there for 30 years and nobody's died yet,'' said MayorH. Odell Weeks, 80.   ``The community doesn't seem to be upset about it at all, atleast to my knowledge,'' agreed City Manager Roland Windham.   ``The people at SRP, they're our neighbors. We go to school withthem. We go to church with them,'' said Windham. ``I have faiththey wouldn't have done something that would endanger their ownfamilies.   ``Even after reading about the things that have happened, Istill have trust in DOE, that they're going to look after the bestinterests of everyone concerned,'' said Windham, who has been citymanager for 25 years.   Jeff Scott, who owns a beauty and barber shop on the town'stidy, two-block shopping plaza, said: ``Everybody's nonchalant whocomes in the shop. They're more concerned about jobs than danger.   ``But I'm concerned. I want to know if there's any danger to theenvironment, what kind of danger there'd be to our health,'' hesaid.   The Energy Department draft report was written by a nine-membercommittee of senior Energy Department officials and representativesof companies that operate the department's nuclear weaponsfacilities, including Du Pont.   A spokesman for Du Pont said company officials had not yet seenthe report, but already moved to correct some of the deficienciesit cited.   ``Some of these problems have been identified,'' spokesman ClifWebb said. ``We have been thinking about making these changes forsome time.''   While acknowledging there have been some changes, the HamricReport, report, named for committee Chairman Phil Hamric, said thatserious problems exist at virtually every level of Savannah River'smanagement and reactor staff.   The authors concluded that reactor operators are not adequatelytrained to detect evolving problems and that operators'``perception of their safety role is too limited. ... Reactorpersonnel lack the in-depth technical background and trainingnecessary to manage (abnormal) situations.''   They recommended that communications be streamlined at alllevels, training of reactor operators be improved and oversight bestrengthened.   The panel was created in response to a request from Paul W.Kaspar, Energy Department manager at Savannah River, after anaborted attempt to restart the P-Reactor this August. That reactorand the facility's other two reactors remain shut down.</TEXT></DOC>
