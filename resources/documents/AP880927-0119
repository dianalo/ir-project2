MichaelDukakis campaigned in the Midwest as his campaign, pleased with hisdebate performance, clipped excerpts for TV ads.   Bush, in remarks prepared for delivery in Columbus, Ohio, saidhis proposed account, under which $1,000 a year could be investedtax free, would help Americans ``become better able to afford ahome, pay for college or start a business'' and would alsocontribute to national economic strength.   Under the plan, the money would have to be invested for at leastfive years, and only people with adjusted gross income of less than$60,000 would be eligible. Taxpayers with adjusted income between$50,000 and $60,000 would get only a partial deduction.   Bush's campaign estimated the program would cost the treasury$70 million in 1989, with the amount increasing to $550 million by1993.   On the flight to Columbus, Bush also upgraded his assessment ofhis performance in the debate Sunday night, saying, ``I feel bettertoday about the way the debate went than the night of the debate.''   ``As I think I told you, I felt it was about even, and I nowthink maybe we did a little better than that in terms of what weneeded to do. But I can't prove it.''   Earlier today, at the University of Miami in Oxford, Ohio, Bushsaid of Dukakis in the debate, ``We smoked him out'' and showedDukakis to be too liberal for American voters.   Dukakis was campaigning today in Illinois, a crucial Midwestbattleground where 24 Electoral College votes are at stake.   With their general election showdown six weeks away, the twopresidential candidates used post-debate, campaign appearances onMonday to clarify statements from their first face-to-faceencounter.   At a rally Monday in Jersey City, N.J., Dukakis sought todistance himself from the American Civil Liberties Union, chargingthat Bush was wrong when he ``suggested that I agree with everyposition ever taken'' by the ACLU.   The GOP nominee, however, refused to let the issue rest.   ``My values are your values and they are not the values of theACLU,'' Bush told a rally and barbecue in Hampton, Ga., nearAtlanta.   Aides to the vice president said Bush would hammer away at theACLU issue in the next few days as he attempts to portray theDemocratic nominee as a liberal out of the American mainstream.   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was making hisfirst foray into Texas, with stops in Houston and El Paso. Quayle'scounterpart, Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, was traveling to Detroit,Mich., and Kansas City, Mo.   On the day after the debate, four nationwide surveys foundlittle change in voter preference and underlying opinions of thetwo candidates. The polls also showed that most Americans believeDukakis vs. Bush ended in a tie.   A Los Angeles Times survey, however, found that Dukakis made``major gains in stature'' by appearing more presidential andstanding up under the pressure.   The Dukakis campaign produced two campaign ads showing excerptsfrom the debate, including the Democratic nominee's summation that,``The best America is not behind us. The best America is yet tocome.''   Bush, meanwhile, rated the debate showdown a draw.   ``I kind of thought it was even,'' said the GOP nominee hoursafter many of his senior aides termed his performance a success.   On Monday, Dukakis and his staff tackled the issue of theMassachusetts governor's membership in the ACLU _ a clearindication of the Democrat's liberal ways, according to Bush.   During Sunday's debate, the vice president referred to Dukakisas a ``card-carrying member'' of the ACLU and attacked some of theorganization's positions.   Dukakis said Bush's efforts to link him to every ACLU stand is``nonsense and he knows it.''   ``Two months ago I signed one of the toughest child pornographylaws in the United States of America,'' Dukakis said. ``I've alwayssupported tax exemptions for religious institutions, and Icertainly do not support Oliver North who the ACLU is defending.''   Bush and his aides tried to prevent the vice president's debatecomment that he hadn't ``sorted out'' possible criminal penaltiesagainst women who obtain abortions from becoming a full-fledgedcontroversy.   Campaign manager James A. Baker III said Bush gave the issuemore thought overnight and decided women are ``additional victims''and should not be punished for undergoing abortions.   But Bush still believes in the possibility of ``punishment asfar as the abortionist is concerned,'' if the courts overturncurrent laws, Baker said.   Bush told reporters at a rally in Jackson, Tenn., there was ``nochange'' in his stance.   At the rally, a joint appearance for Bush and Quayle, the GOPvice presidential nominee responded to Dukakis' debate comment that``the notion of President Quayle is a very, very troubling notiontonight.''   For many, ``the notion of President Dukakis is a very, verytroubling notion today,'' Quayle said.</TEXT></DOC>
