The deadline, which wasJuly 30, will be extended to Aug. 10.   The agreement removes the possibility that teamsters wouldstrike the country's largest deliverer of packages when thecurrent three-year UPS contract expires at midnight Tuesday.</LP><TEXT>   UPS said the union sought to extend the deadline becausemany teamster members had failed to receive their ballots inthe mail. The extension would allow more time for UPSteamster workers to receive those ballots.   About 140,000 UPS workers are eligible to vote on thecontract. The union has advised its members to reject thecompany's &quot;final&quot; wage and benefit offer.   UPS said it agreed that the contract, if approved, wouldbe retroactive to Wednesday.   &quot;We think it's a reasonable request under thecircumstances,&quot; said Kent C. Nelson, chairman and chiefexecutive of UPS. &quot;We're glad it will enable more of ourpeople to cast votes on this important offer,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
