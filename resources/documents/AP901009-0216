A deep recession is spreading through many of the countries thatstretch south from the Caribbean to Tierra del Fuego.   The free-market economic ``shock'' programs adopted in the pastseveral years have conquered hyperinflation, but at the brutal costof making most Latin Americans desperately poor.   As standards of living fall, the specter of last year's bloodyfood riots in Venezuela haunts the region's leaders.   ``Every person has limits and we are now approaching ours,''Javier Silva Ruete, former economy minister of Peru, said recently.``The people are going to explode.''   Anger in the Dominican Republic turned to violence in August. Atleast 11 people were killed and 50 injured in clashes with policeafter the government doubled the prices of basic goods.   Days later in Peru, three people were killed in looting when newPresident Alberto Fujimori eliminated subsidies, quadrupled foodprices and raised the cost of gasoline 30-fold.   Venezuelan students went into the streets in July to protesthigher fuel prices. In August, the vice president of Argentinapredicted government austerity would lead to ``socialconvulsions.''   Brazilian auto workers rioted in July, burning 50 cars. Unionleader Vicente Paulo Da Silva called it ``a sign of the violencethat could erupt as a result of the workers' despair.''   Violence probably will continue because governments have littlemoney, and sometimes little political desire, to ease the humancosts of the austerity programs they impose.   Few deny that changes were needed.   Inflation devastated most economies in recent years. Peru'sannual inflation rate of 3,000 percent devoured government revenuesand made it impossible for businessmen to plan. The poor sufferedas prices outstripped wges.   Massive foreign debt choked many Latin American countries andmost virtually stopped payments, leading companies and bankers toinvest elsewhere. Local investors lost confidence and movedbillions of dollars abroad.   Bureaucratic bloat and inefficient government services hamperedthe ability of businesses to produce. High tariffs artificiallyprotected domestic industry.   The crisis peaked first in Bolivia. In 1985, with inflation sobad it took a pound of paper currency to buy a pound of bread,President Victor Paz Estenssoro imposed drastic measures withindays of taking office.   He slashed subsidies and raised prices, which cut consumptionand narrowed the deficit gap. He fired tens of thousands ofgovernment workers and allowed many small businesses to fail.   Bolivians protested, but inflation was brought under control andeconomists declared the reforms a success.   The Bolivian shock became a model for other Latin Americannations. Venezuela became the model of what to avoid.   Venezuelans, accustomed to large subsidies from the oil boom ofthe 1970s, were rudely surprised when President Carlos Andres Perezended price controls and raised bus fares in February 1989.   Hundreds of thousands filled the streets of Caracas, erectingbarricades, burning cars and looting hundreds of stores. For threedays, the city of 5 million was out of government control.   When soldiers finally moved in to restore order, at least 300people were killed, the government says. Human rights groups putthe total nearer 1,000.   Months after the Caracas uprising, food riots in Rosario,Argentina, cost 16 lives, so the risks were known to governmentsthat applied shocks this year in Brazil, the Dominican Republic andPeru.   President Fernando Collor of Brazil understood the lesson. Byraising the minimum wage while temporarily freezing prices, hegained important short-term support for the austerity measures heintroduced March 16.   Economic chaos allowed Fujimori no such liberties in Peru.   When he took office July 28, the government was bankrupt andonly one of five workers had a steady job. There were severeshortages of gasoline and bread and the worst drought in memory haddestroyed many vital crops.   Fujimori's hastily prepared measures sent prices soaring 397percent in August alone. The shock left the economy nearlyparalyzed. Many factories closed and sales declined 75 percent.   Hunger became widespread. Emergency food aid has taken weeks toreach the poor and some areas have yet to receive even one bag ofrice. Many people survive on a bowl of watery soup a day.   Juan Jose Vega of the UNICEF office in Lima said the shock has``tremendously and permanently affected'' the mental and physicalhealth of an entire generation of Peruvian children.   Economic shock programs in other countries have been lesssevere, but the recessions they provoked also have fallen mostheavily on the poor and the middle class.   President Carlos Menem of Argentina managed to halve annualinflation, which was running at more than 3,600 percent when hetook office last year. But shantytowns are spreading, hospitals runshort of drugs and crime is soaring in a nation that once had theregion's largest middle class.   Inflation in Brazil is down from about 80 percent a month tonear 10 percent, but more than 1 million workers have lost theirjobs since March.   There is little promise of economic growth soon. The example ofBolivia is sobering: Five years after the shock was applied,inflation remains low but the economy is stagnant.   Even deeper recession may lie ahead. Most Latin Americancountries import oil, which has become dramatically more expensivebecause of the Persian Gulf crisis.   No one is sure how long the poor will wait on a continent whereguerrilla movements have been a part of life for generations.   More than 20,000 Peruvians have been killed in politicalviolence since the Shining Path, a Maoist group, began fighting adecade ago.   ``We are a nation already at war,'' said Sen. Javier DiezCanseco, a Peruvian leftist.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wednesday AMs, Oct. 17</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
