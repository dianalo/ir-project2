Unfortunately, there are those within the industry who have taken a frivolous off-the-cuff remark quite to heart (letters, July 30). While I take my professional responsibilities very seriously, I do not take myself or my profession so seriously as to refrain from a touch of self-deprecating humor on occasion.    I am sorry that I was misinterpreted, and I apologize to those in the industry who have worked to dispel such stereotypes and were offended by the remarks.
