(CAM) used to mean one thing: a laboriouseffort to produce programs for guiding numerically controlled (NC) automatedmachine tools.andM;But as CAM has evolved over the past three decades to encompass a muchgreater portion of the overall manufacturing process, an assortment of CAMtools has emerged to automate much of the task of programming manufacturingsystems.andM;The most recent advances -- the interactive, graphical generation andverification of NC programs as well as the programming and simulation ofrobotic workcells and entire flexible automation systems -- can be largelyattributed to a developing partnership between three-dimensional software and3D hardware.andM;The transformation of raw materials into products is comprised of three basicactivities: process, movement, and storage.andP;  The simulation of process andmovement, together with storage in a flexible manufacturing environment, ismade possible by the ability of 3D computers to process and representtremendous amounts of graphical data.andM;Before the advent of 3D computer-based simulation, it was necessary to takeexpensive manufacturing equipment out of production in order to test theaccuracy of NC toolpaths on wax or wood prototypes.andP;  Likewise, in order toprogram, test, and set up for new manufacturing chores, companies would haveto take a robot or an entire robotic workcell offline for a period of time.andM;Downtime costs for these manufacturing devices thus became prohibitive to thepoint that manufacturers often chose to explore alternatives which wouldallow them to keep older machines in production.andM;A 3D computer is most simply defined as one with the ability to processcomplex, shaded image data at rates approaching those with which real worldphenomena occur.andM;The primary features that differentiate 3D CAM software running on 3Dhardware from the same software running on 2D hardware are: the ability todynamically manipulate and animate 3D smooth-shaded images, and the abilityto dynamically change the viewport or perspective view.andM;To accomplish these ends, a 3D computer must have sufficient power andfunctionality to allow calculations on 3D data and interactive manipulationsof surfaced and shaded displays.andM;The compute and graphical performance this implies allows for instantaneousinteraction and smooth motion.andP;  Because dedicated graphics subsystems makesuch performance possible, they define 3D workstations, differentiating themfrom 2D computers.andM;By definition, 3D software produces a 3D database including all of thegeometric features that describe a given object, including precise surfacesand surface textures, for manufacturing applications, the requirements forprecision are especially demanding.andM;Because of the performance advantages inherent in 3D computing, moreoverworkstations can be used to simulate the behaviour of complex manufacturingmachinery and systems and test the effectiveness of competing alternativesprior to making a purchase.andM;Instances where 3D software and 3D hardware have been used to achievesubstantial, measured competitive gains are numerous.andM;Among some that were noted as part of recent KPMG Peat Marwick study ofSilicon Graphics manufacturer customers were Karsten Manufacturing, usingCamax software to speed the generation and verification of cutter paths forthe NC tools used to produce Ping golf clubs, and General Motors, which makesuse of Deneb Robotics software to plan and implement robotic welding,painting, and assembly.andM;Visually dramaticandM;The 3D difference in CAM has often been visually dramatic.andP;  Benefits derivedby manufacturing engineers and process planners have included not onlyimprovements to existing CAM features and functionality, but also much thatis unique to 3D visualization.andM;Among the benefits which might be described as 2D CAM enhancements have beenimproved accuracy in NC toolpaths and better tools for anticipating andcorrecting interferences caused by NC machines and collisions between robots.andM;One dramatic instance of NC verification occurred recently at McDonnellDouglas Aircraft, where NC programmers have taken to using software developedby Automation Technology Products (ATP) to verify and edit NC programs.andM;Prior to acquiring the NC verification software, it had been necessary forthe engineers to take milling machines out of production to cut trial partsif they were to verify the accuracy of their NC toolpaths.andM;Now, though, with the simulation capabilities afforded by ATP's NCV software,Douglas' people are finding an average of 350 errors a month using two SGIworkstations.andP;  This early detection means the NC code now hitting the shopfloor has 70 per cent fewer errors than the NC code previously generatedusing 2D hardware -- translating to about 600 hours of saved milling machineand operator time each month.andM;The inherently three-dimensional features exploited by Douglas Aircraft haveincluded the ability to visualize a proposed manufacturing layout, a set oftools for evaluating costly new manufacturing equipment and systems beforepurchase, and the means for graphically creating, verifying, and editing NCand robotic program.andM;Another particularly well documented case for 3D computing comes from GeneralMotors, where six robots programmed for a spot welding application worksimultaneously in closely confined areas.andM;Approximately 300 engineer-hours had once been required to optimize robotoperations.andM;Now, though, using the Interactive Graphics Robot Instruction Program (IGRIP)from Deneb Robotics, the same application can be simulated, with the actualprograms generated during the simulation being down loaded to the robots --in just 60 engineer-hours.andM;Besides realizing an 80 per cent savings in time, the simulation verifies thesoftware, anticipates potential collisions, minimizes the time required bythe robots to complete their task, and eliminates the need to physicallyvisit plant sites for process verifications.andM;The author is a Computer Aided Manufacturing specialist with the ApplicationsProducts Division of Silicon Graphics Inc.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
