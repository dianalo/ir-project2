DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Teamsters union officials reached a tentativelabor-reform settlement Monday that prosecutors said would end yearsof alleged mobster influence through permanent reforms, includingthe first direct election of top union leaders.   The settlement, announced just hours before the start of a trialon a lawsuit to oust the union's allegedly mob-dominated leadership,was reached at 1:30 a.m. Monday in Manhattan after round-the-clockweekend negotiations.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced the terms of theagreement in Washington, saying it will give the government ``thetools to clean up this union and return control to rank and fileunion members.''   According to the Justice Department, the tentative agreement is acompromise that calls for three court-appointed watchdogs to overseethe union, which would continue to be run by its leaders.   The overseers would be appointed for three years by U.S. DistrictJudge David N. Edelstein with the joint approval of both sides. Onewould investigate and prosecute alleged union corruption, anotherwould administer disciplinary action and the third would overseeelections.   The settlement was subject to Edelstein's approval. The judgedeferred acting until Tuesday, saying the 30-page document, which hereceived at Monday afternoon, was ``very complicated.''   At a press briefing in New York, the lead prosecutor in the case,Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Mastro said that once approved byEdelstein, changes the under the settlement will be ``incorporatedinto the Teamsters' constitution in perpetuity.''   The Justice Department's lawsuit sought to oust the union's topleadership as the culmination of the government's decades-longbattle to force reform on the 1.6 million-member union.   Using federal racketeering laws, the Justice Department alsosought a court-appointed trustee or committee to oversee thenation's largest union and impose a series of reforms. It was thefirst time the government tried to seize control of an entire union.   Thornburgh told reporters in Washington the settlement contained``roughly the same kind of remedy that was sought'' in the lawsuit.   However, James T. Grady, the Teamster's general counsel, saidthat in exchange for the agreement, none of the union's rulingexecutive board members would have to resign and no court-appointedtrustee or administrator would run the union on a day-to-day basis.   ``The members are assured there is a mechanism in place to removethose persons alleged to be conducting improper activities,'' saidGrady. ``The goals of a clean and democratic union are consistentwith the goals of the current leadership.''   Grady said the union agreed to introduce constitutionalamendments for direct election of top union officers at its 1991convention, what Mastro called ``sweeping election reforms.''   ``All Teamsters international union officials will be directlyelected by the membership in secret ballot. That's never happenedbefore,'' said Mastro.   He noted that whether the amendments were approved in 1991 was``irrelevent'' because the reform ``is automatic by virtue of thisdecree.''   The lawsuit, filed last June, claimed the Teamsters' leadershiphad been dominated by organized crime, which ``deprived unionmembers of their rights through a pattern of racketeering'' and a``campaign of fear'' that included 20 murders, dozens of bombings,beatings, bribes, extortion and theft.   Twenty-five of 26 reputed mob figures originally named asdefendants have been convicted of Teamsters-related crimes such asextortion through threats of union problems, embezzlement of unionfunds and illegal labor payoffs.   Most, however, were dismissed from the case when they eitheragreed, or were ordered, to drop any involvement with the Teamsters.Five, including convicted Colombo crime family boss Carmine``Junior'' Persico, have been severed from the case and will betried later.   Teamsters President William J. McCarthy was among the 11remaining individual defendants in the case.   Mastro said that in addition to the union itself _ theInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen andHelpers of America _ the 11 individual defendants had signed theagreement.   On Sunday, the union ran a full page ad in The New York Times,condemning the government lawsuit. ``Teamsters are not the only oneson trial,'' the ad asserted. ``So is the American system ofJustice.''   Last week, three members of the Teamsters executive board,including Weldon Mathis, the union's second-ranking official, agreedto a settlement. Three other vice presidents reached settlementslast month. That left 11 board members, including McCarthy, and theunion itself as defendants.   ``That got us moving,'' Grady said of the Mathis settlement.   When he filed the lawsuit in June, then-U.S. Attorney RudolphGiuliani accused the Teamsters' leadership of making a ``devil'spact'' with organized crime. Giuliani said the lawsuit was anattempt to take back the union from the Mafia.   The government's move was roundly criticized by congressmen andlabor leaders. The AFL-CIO, which allowed the Teamsters to rejoin in1987 after a 30-year rift over corruption, called the lawsuit ```aclear abuse of the government's prosecutorial power.''   Court papers noted that four Teamsters presidents since the 1950shave faced federal felony charges and three were convicted: DavidBeck for embezzlement, James ``Jimmy'' Hoffa for obstructing justiceand mail fraud, and Roy Williams for trying to bribe a U.S. senator.   The fourth, Jackie Presser, the union's president at the time thelawsuit was brought, died while under indictment on embezzlementcharges.</TEXT></DOC>
