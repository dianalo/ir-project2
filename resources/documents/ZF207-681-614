(computer programs).andO;Ticker:    AAPL.andO;Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (product enhancement)System 7.0 (Operating system) (product specifications).andO;Topic:     Operating SystemsAnalysisFonts.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The standard journalist's question about Apple's System 7.0 announcementsthis past week is: &quot;Do these announcements put the Macintosh in front of OS/2or merely let it catch up?&quot; I have to admit that I'm amused by the notionthat tbe Macintosh has to catch up with OS/2 (particularly given thePresentation Manager announcements IBM is making, which are discussed below).andO;In almost every respect, OSI 2 is missing the very features - namely commonroutines for routine tasks, a sophisticated user interface, bit-mappedprinting interface - that applications software actually uses in theMacintosh System today, while the features on which OS/2 is clearly given tbeadvantage - namely, pre-emptive multitasking, named pipes, distributedprocessing, and multi-processing - are not used by any I eading-edge orbest-selling application program on any computer sold as a personal computer(yet).andM;So, is tbe Macintosh merely catching up? Wrong question.andP;  The right questionis: Will the improvements that Apple is making in its system in tbe next yearnot only maintain the loyalty of Macintosh users, but attract both brand-newusers and converts from other platforms? The short answer is, &quot;Yes.&quot;With whatApple has planned for its system software (assuming tbe company will be ableto deliver what it has promised in a reasonable time frame) plus its currentmomentum and serious confusion about and disarray in the competition, thecompany would have to suffer irreversible brain damage to avoid more thandoubling its Macintosb business in the next two to three years (from about$2.5 billion in FY1988 to about $6 billion in FY 1991).andP;  While there are manyspecific enhancements to the Macintosb System (which you will be readingabout endlessly over die next few weeks, thanks to Apple's PR machinery),there are three general areas where Apple is improving its system.andM;IMAGING: Now that we have all begun to understand the definition and role ofthe phrase &quot;imaging model&quot; (thanks to Steve Jobs), Apple is delivering itsown, home-grown imaging model and beginning to revise the fundamentalrelationships tbat depend on tbat imaging model.andP;  The Macintosh bashistorically bad a dual imaging model: Quickdraw for most of us andPostscript for specific graphic applications of the system, primarilypublishing and graphic arts.andP;  For most applications developers, though, thereal imaging model - tbe theoretical model that the programmer maintained inhis head for bow graphical elements were displayed or printed - bas alwaysbeen Quickdraw.andP;  Tbe only developers tbat adopted Postscript as an imagingmodel were Adobe Systems (for Illustrator), Aldus Corp. (for Pagemaker,Freehand, and Persuasion), and other developers that wrote their programs todeal directly with Postscript.andP;  For everyone else, Apple bas always offered aspecial utility called LaserPrep that automatically translates Quickdrawcalls into Postscript instructions, so that the developer need not &quot;think&quot; inPostscript.andP;  Now Apple is improving Quickdraw in three fundamental areas:typograpby, color, and printing.andP;  (Its actually a bit of a misnomer to callQuickdraw tbe imaging model, since Quickdraw is actually the system tool fordrawing vectors, not tbe overall collection of tools that include fonts,print drivers, and otber resources.andP;  But don't bother this industry with tbefacts; it might confuse us.)andM;The new outline fonts in the Macintosh System are quite remarkable.andP;  Theyprovide an open, published format (called by its code name, Royal, for lackof a better name) for every type vendor to put tbeir font descriptions in sothat the System 7.0 user only needs one file for each font in his system.andO;That resolves tbe messy situation where users bad to understand tbedifference between bit-mapped and outlined fonts, and makes sizing anddisplaying fonts in documents much more direct.andP;  In addition, the first demosof tbe outline fonts indicate tbat most users will perceive no performanceloss on tbe display from switching from bit-mapped to outlined fonts.andP;  (Thatstatement is made with the assumption that all otber things are equal: youmust switch to a new system version witb many otber changes in order to useoutlined fonts.andP;  It may well be tbat tbe new system will be slower in otherrespects.) Most important, developers will now be able to mucb more rapidlyintegrate otber kinds of bit-mapped output devices into the Macintosh (thinkof using an HP Laserjet or Deskjet or an Epson LQ printer as naturally as anyApple printer) and users will have a mucb more consistent way of dealing witbdifferent output devices.andP;  For tbe first time, Apple users will be able touse any Royal font at any size witb the Laserwriter SC, Imagewriter LQ, andApplefax modem, instead of having to wait for Apple to make bit-mapped fontsfor each character weight and size.andP;  And, finally, desktop presentations willhave a chance to achieve the kind of penetration tbat Apple originallypromised, since using type on relatively dumb film-recorders will be naturaland easy.andM;(Unfortunately, Adobe Systems has chosen to engage in a thinly veiled war ofwords over Apple's announcement of outline fonts and, in particular, thewidespread support for Apple's font format shown by type vendors around theworld.andP;  Adobe has announced a retail product called Adobe Type Manager, whichwill also scale type on the display and basically has the same set ofcapabilities as Apple's font scaler except that it uses Adobe's proprietaryformat for fonts.andP;  Theoretically, Adobe is saying tbat it wants to make surethat type is available in a single format across all workstations, so thatusers don't have to worry about having the rigbt vendor's type in tbeirprinter or computer.andP;  If that's true, though, one does wonder why the companychose precisely the week before Apple's developer's conference to announceits own product instead of announcing it during a publishing forum - as itannounced its licensing of its fontproduction technology at tbeSeyboldSeminar last month - or announcing it when it was ready to ship this fall.andO;The bottom line: Once System 7.0 is delivered, users of Postscript printerswill have to make sure they have both Apple's Font Manager and Adobe TypeManager in tbeir system folder.andP;  Without Adobe Type Manager, tbe potentialconfusion between which fonts are available for wbicb output device could beterminally frustrating.andP;  Unfortunately for Adobe, this situation will makeAdobe look self-centered and defensive to the Macintosb user.andP;  Adobe couldhave worked with Apple to make sure that the system would call theappropriate font in the printer, regardless of whether the application wasusing an Apple or Adobe font.andP;  Instead, tbe user will have to learn to livewith two different and incompatible sets of outline fonts.andP;  For the averageuser, that won't mean much since all of tbe major type vendors are sure toproduce their library in both formats; but for the professional user, theirlives will be just a little more difficult.)andM;Apple has already announced 32-Bit Color Quickdraw and promised delivery onit for tbe second quarter for use with the existing System release.andP;  But thiscomponent of the imaging model for the Macintosb is just as important to thenew system as outline fonts or the new print architecture.andP;  Without goinginto the details, wbat 32-bit Quickdraw means is tbat Apple has integratedfull color into its imaging model so that developers bave no fundamentalrestriction on how they think of tbe images that can be used witb tbeirapplications.andP;  It's easy to point out tbat the majority of Macintosbes arestill sold witb a built in, nine-ineb, black-and white (1-bit) monitor andwonder what the point of 32-bit color is when most of the machines can't useit.andP;  But the point is tbat the developer - particularly developers tbatreally care about color, such as those that make publishing software - cannow design their software to use photorealistic color in a standard way andusers can buy the equipment needed to display those color documents in anaccurate fashion.andM;The third important component in tbe improved imaging model is wbat Applecalls its new print architecture.andP;  When I wrote about tbe Applefax modem (see&quot;Applefax: A Glimpse Into The Future,&quot;Issue 4.14, 08-22-88), 1 was surprisedto discover from Apple that it was taking upwards of 18 months for thecompany to develop a print driver.andP;  Think about tbat: that's just the driver,not the actually output device itself or the application or system resources.andO;That's not mucb of an advantage for Apple over the PC world's average of 12months or so to develop a basic set of print drivers for a new applicationprogram.andP;  Now Apple bas solved tbat problem (in a way that Microsoft and IBMwould be well advised to study carefully): it has developed a multi-stepprocess for sending output from application to device.andP;  One of tbose is atranslation step where the system takes standard Quickdraw calls and convertsthem to basic elements for different classes of output devices (raster,vector, and Postscript).andM;With that basic work done, the output device vendor (including Apple for itsown devices) then only needs to apply tbat to their own device and takeadvantage of tbeir special features.andP;  That means development time on newdrivers can be cut to what Apple claims is about three months.andP;  Plus it meanstbat Apple can simplify tbe user interface for dealing with output devices.andM;Apple appears to bave completed a substantial amount of tbe work involved inthe area of its imaging model.andP;  32-Bit Quickdraw is due to be delivered bythe end of the summer.andP;  Outlined fonts are demonstrable, although the typevendors still have a lot of work to do to put their type libraries into tbeApple format.andP;  And mucb of what Apple has learned about writing print driversis inherent in the new Laserwriter driver that Apple has already announcedand is seeding witb developers for the current system.andP;  Indeed, the only areaof major weakness is tbat tbe company hasn't promised any significant upgradein tbe capabilities of Quickdraw itself although it is clearly intending toimprove Quickdraw in the next major release of tbe system.andM;INTEGRATION: The second major area of improvement in the Macintosh systemwill be in the integration of the system, including integration of differentdata types, of different sources of data, and between applications.andP;  Tbe fourmajor elements being introduced to tbe system are wbat Apple callsInter-Application Communications, Database Access, tbe CommunicationsToolbox, and the File System Manager.andP;  In all four cases, wbat Apple is doingis virtualizing tbe interface between the application and the hardware sotbat the system provides some level of standardization and control over theprocess of communicating and so tbat, when tbe company wants to upgrade thesystem, developers won't bave to tear tbeir applications apart to support thenew features.andP;  The File System Manager, for instance, will allow tbe user tomount disks that tbe Superdrive can read on the desktop, instead of using autility to translate foreign files to the Macintosh file system, as well asmaking it much easier to integrate new kinds of media, such as CD-ROM drives.andO;The previously announced Communications Toolbox (which will also be deliveredin the third quarter for the current system) will make it possible to bavemultiple simultaneous communications sessions and provides standard elementsfor building connections between any two devices, by breaking the processdown into Connections, Terminals, and File Transfers.andM;Beyond communications and file systems, however, probably the mostinteresting and potentially significant capabilities come from tbecombination of Database Access and Inter-Application Communications.andO;Database Access refers to the integration of what is now known as CL/1 intotbe standard system, wbicb means that every Macintosh system will include theclient portion of CL/1 so tbat applications software can depend on thatinterface for gaining access (through the connection between CL,/l clientsand CL/1 servers) to any host database, including both SQL and non-SQLdatabases.andP;  Inter-Application Communications refers to a variety of protocolsat successively higher levels of standardization that enable different kindsof communications between programs, including communication between userapplications and the CL/1 client for establishing connections witb host data.andO;Inter-Application Communications is the most complex area of development forpersonal computer programs, no matter what platform we're talking about, andtherefore is fraught witb all sorts of hype and misunderstanding.andP;  The plaintruth is tbat every platform developer is essentially on a level playingfield, since this particular game is still being invented.andM;The nut of getting applications programs to talk to each other appears to besomehow defining in advance just wbat kinds of things applications might wantto communicate and then finding an acceptable way to define tbose things sotbat applications developers themselves - a notoriously independent bunch, ifthere ever was one - will support them.andP;  In other words, if you want theability to cut a live copy of a drawing from one developer's drawing programand paste it into another developer's word processor, the word processingvendor - who isn't likely to understand tbe finer points of drawing programs- has to be willing to recognize the standard form for updating that pictureand the drawing vendor has to be willing to recognize that communicating thepicture might be more important than that really amazing Bezier effect bediscovered at 3:00 A.M.andP;  last night.andP;  What Apple has done is to define foursuch levels of communication: Inter-Process Communication (where thedeveloper controls both sides of tbe communication and doesn't care aboutstandards), Program-toProgram Communication (where one program is sendingdata only to another program), Event Manager PPC (where programs arecommunicating standard events, as tbe system itself already does), and AppleEvents (a strictly defined set of standard messages for applications to useto actually control each otber).andP;  While this kind of communications betweenapplications sounds really whizzy, I have to admit tbat I'm still skepticalthat this industry can ever acbieve tbe kind of cooperation andstandardization necessary to make it anything more than a pipe-dream for realhuman beings who don't know mucb about computers.andM;CONSISTENCY: Tbe last major area of improvement and probably most immediatelywelcome to users are improvements in tbe Finder (tbe Macintosh's desktopmanager) and in tbe memory model for the computer, wbicb together provide theuser with a more consistent interface and operation.andP;  The new Finder isprobably the least stable of all of the new aspects of the System 7.0 andtherefore the most subject to change, but tbe core of the changes are thatthe way the user deals with system resources becomes mucb simpler (simplydrag devices, fonts, sounds, accessories into the appropriate folder insidetbe system folder, instead of using utilities called tbe Font/DA Mover orChooser), the number of active objects on the desktop increases (drag adocument onto a printer icon and it prints!), the system becomes more helpful(with on-line help), and the desktop becomes more controllable (the user candefine wbat information windows show, install whatever files tbey want tointo the accessory Apple menu, and control processes and remap icons easily).andO;In addition, the underlying memory model for the system has been extended toa 32-bit model and provided with virtual memory so that users don't bave topay attention to their usage of memory as closely as they do now withMultifinder.andP;  Indeed, tbe addition of virtual memory and tbe requirement oftwo megabytes of memory for the new system, allow Apple to turn wbat has beenknown as Multifinder into the standard Finder so tbat tbe ability to loadmultiple applications into memory all at once becomes standard for all users,instead of an option for those tbat bad enough memory.andM;That's a fairly quick overview of what will take Apple another 6-9 months todeliver and the press at least two forests of trees to dissect and analyze.andO;But tbe sum of the matter is that Apple has planned an impressive andfar-reaching set of changes in its system software.andP;  Indeed, probably themost impressive aspect of the System 7.0 announcement is the fact tbat Appleis willing to go belly to belly with its users and require them to upgrade totwo megabytes of memory in order to gain the value of tbe new system.andP;  Tbatsingle bit of cbutzpah (along witb tbe company's increasing focus on 68030systems witb color, sound, and tbe Superdrive) demonstrates that Appleunderstands how important it is not only to sell users new and improvedsystems, but to also give developers a new and improved installed base totarget.andP;  In other words, Apple knows you've got to give developers somethingto think about and shoot for or they'll start looking slyly at That otherPlatform.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
