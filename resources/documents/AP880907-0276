(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Financial Corp. of America, said Wednesdayit would file for bankruptcy, a move widely expected after thefederal bailout of FCA's subsidiary, American Savings andamp; LoanAssociation.   The development did not affect customers' accounts at the 186California branches of American Savings, the nation'ssecond-largest savings and loan.   FCA announced its board of directors authorized filing of apetition for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of thefederal bankruptcy law. A filing is to be made this week.   Also Wednesday, William Popejoy, FCA chairman and chiefexecutive officer, resigned his position to head a new AmericanSavings under control of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.   Both actions stem from a bank board decision Tuesday to placeAmerican Savings into a temporary receivership _ part of a $2billion federal bailout plan that will turn control of Americanover to an investor group led by Texan Robert M. Bass.   In effect, the receivership creates a new, federally charteredAmerican Savings and severs all ties between the Sandamp;L and FCA.   Deposits at American Savings continue to be insured up to$100,000 by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.Additionally, federal regulators several months ago took theunusual step of guaranteeing deposits larger than $100,000 ineffort to bolster confidence in the long-troubled Sandamp;L.   While depositors and some creditors are protected, stockholdersin FCA saw their investments wiped out by the federal action, whichdoes not provide for compensation from American to FCA or itsshareholders.   The bank board agreed Monday to turn control of the new Americanover to the Bass Group. Bass agreed to pump $550 million cash intoAmerican.   The deal, the biggest rescue of a troubled thrift, calls for thebank board to inject an estimated $1.5 billion in cash intoAmerican over the next 10 years, and to provide $500 million inpromissory notes. The first cash infusion _ of $250 million _ wasmade Tuesday.   Popejoy, 50, was brought in by the bank board to head Americanin 1984, at the start of an extended attempt to let the Sandamp;L wok itsway out of trouble.   American faltered after several years of rapid growth under theformer management. Its problems include billions of dollars inloans made to shaky real estate ventures in California, Texas andelsewhere. Many of those loans are delinquent or in foreclosure.</TEXT></DOC>
