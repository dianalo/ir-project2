Hematopoiesiswas studied by the in vitro culture of bone marrow granulocyte-macrophageprogenitors (CFU-GM). Prenatally irradiated dogs exhibited a progressive,significant reduction in CFU-GM which was accompanied by decreases inperipheral blood leukocytes up to 24 weeks of age. Dogs which were neonatallyirradiated also demonstrated a significant reduction in CFU-GM whichwas accompanied by significant alterations in peripheral white and redblood cell parameters. This was transient, however, and these dogs showedpartial recovery of CFU-GM and hematologic parameter by 24 weeks of age.The persistent CFU-GM deficit in prenatally irradiated dogs suggestsa relatively greater sensitivity of fetal marrow as compared to neonatalbone marrow for long-term damage by ionizing radiation.</TEXT></DOC>
