It is a bitdifficult to kill (Israelis). But there are so many (Americans andFrenchman) everywhere in the world,'' he said.   At least 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have died in the17-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli in the West Bankand Gaza Strip, which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt in the1967 Middle East war.   IRNA said Rafsanjani spoke at a prayer sermon today in Tehranbefore huge rallies to mark the Iranian holiday in support of thePalestinian cause.   Television showed pictures of thousands of demonstrators.Excerpts of the speech also were carried by Tehran Radio.   ``God knows there is a solution if you announce today that fromnow on you will threaten American interests throughout the world,''Rafsanjani said.   IRNA said Rafsanjani also encouraged Palestinians to hijackplanes to force Israel to release prisoners and to blow upfactories in Western countries.   Rafsanjani criticized PLO leader Yasser Arafat for renouncingterrorism and recognizing Israel's right to exist.   He also brushed aside Western reaction to his support forviolence.   ``Now they will start saying that so and so, as a man in charge,and as the speaker of Parliament has officially called for acts ofterror ... But let them say it ... aren't they saying it now?''   Soon after coming to power in the 1979 Islamic revolution,Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, set aside May 5 as QudsDay, referring to the Arabic name for Jerusalem. He has called onIslamic nations to free Jerusalem, Islam's third holiest city afterMecca and Medina, from Israeli rule.   ``Those who give $10 billion a year to preserve Israel and knowwhat they are doing, is their blood worth anything?'' Rafsanjanisaid.   His remarks appeared to be a further deepening of the Iraniancampaign against the West, launched Feb. 14 by Khomeini with adeath sentence against British author Salman Rushdie for his book``The Satanic Verses.''   Khomeini said Rushdie blasphemed Islam in the book and used hiscondemnation as a platform to attack slackening revolutionary zealin Iran.   Western reaction to the death sentence, including 14 countriesthat called home their top envoys from Tehran, led Khomeini andother Iranian leaders to say ties with the West are unnecessary.Diplomatic relations with Britain were severed.   Rafsanjani was the leader of pragmatists seeking Western help torebuild after the ruinous war with Iraq that ended in a cease-firelast year.   But his recent pronouncements have been harsh toward the West,including his statement last month that a spy ring that includedIranian naval officers giving military and other secrets to theUnited States had been broken.</TEXT></DOC>
