The trees will be removed and burned as soon as a special chemical arrives that the Agriculture Department wants used to treat the elm stumps, William Tietz, the university's president, said.    Mr. Tietz announced the decision in a telephone interview with the Associated Press after meeting with Gary Strobel, the plant pathologist who injected the trees without university or federal approval.    &quot;I agreed that he will terminate the experiment,&quot; Mr. Tietz said. The program will be ended today, he added.    However, he said that he wasn't certain when the trees would be removed because university officials must await the chemical.    Mr. Tietz said he would announce his decision tomorrow on what, if any, punitive actions might be taken against Mr. Strobel.    Mr. Tietz said the plant pathologist &quot;regrets the nature of the disturbance&quot; caused by his experiment.    The Environmental Protection Agency criticized Mr. Strobel last week, and the campus biosafety committee recommended a similar university reprimand and termination of the experiment. An administrative review panel also called for a reprimand, but didn't call for an end to Mr. Strobel's project.    Mr. Strobel couldn't be reached for comment. His son, Scott, a biochemist who worked with his father on the experiment, said yesterday that his father asked Mr. Tietz for permission to burn the treated elms.    Mr. Tietz said he refused to allow detruction of the trees until getting approval and directions from the EPA and the Agriculture Department. He said he withheld permission to ensure that no &quot;evidence&quot; was destroyed before the agencies concluded their investigations. </TEXT></DOC>
