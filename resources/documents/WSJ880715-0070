The study suggests that the eye-cancer oncogene plays a role in the genesis of the adult malignancy that affects about 25,000 to 30,000 people a year, one-fourth of all lung-cancer cases. Moreover, some scientists speculate that the link to the gene may supply a potential reason why some smokers get the cancer and some do not.    The study, which appears in today's edition of the journal Science, is by J. William Harbour and Frederic J. Kaye of the National Cancer Institute, with colleagues Shinn-Liang Lai, Jacqueline Whang-Peng, Adi F. Gazdar and John D. Minna.    Oncogenes are genes or hereditary units with the potential to cause normal cells to turn cancerous. The retinoblastoma, or Rb, gene, located on chromosome 13, is a &quot;recessive oncogene,&quot; which means that it triggers cancer only when it is damaged or inactivated. Other oncogenes, such as those in the myc family, also implicated in small-cell lung cancer, cause cancer when they are hyperactive or overexpressed.    The study in Science found that the Rb gene was structurally damaged in 18% of small-cell lung cancer cell lines, and nonfunctional in a startling 60% of the cell lines. In contrast, the gene was found to be intact in 90% of other types lung cancer, as well as in normal lung tissue.    Many mysteries persist about the two previously unrelated tumors. Retinoblastoma, while very rare, is hereditary and occurs in familial patterns in 40% of all cases. Yet small-cell lung cancer has no clear family pattern, and doesn't coincide with retinoblastoma, either within families or in the same patient. Still, the two share certain similarities; for example, both are hormone-secreting tumors.    What is most intriguing to many is the link between the environmental and genetic roots in small-cell lung cancer, a virulent killer. Dr. Minna, a co-author of the paper, said the work contributes to the &quot;two-hit&quot; theory of lung cancer. &quot;It is possible that one hit could come from your parents,&quot; he said, in the form of the gene, &quot;and that a second hit from smoking, or from living in a house with high radon.&quot; The paper suggests smoking may supply the necessary damage to the Rb gene that unleashes cancer.    &quot;Small-cell lung cancer is closely associated with heavy cigarette smoking, and carcinogen exposure from tobacco may generate an increased mutation rate in the bronchial epithelium,&quot; or lining of the lung, the paper said. The Rb gene, a large gene, may be especially susceptible to mutation and thus may commonly become damaged in the lungs of cigarette smokers.    Moreover, the Rb gene is now a suspect in several cancers. Eva Lee of the University of California at San Diego, author of a study on Rb and breast cancer, called the cancer institute study &quot;important&quot; in further understanding the oncogene's role. &quot;Since cloning of the gene, we have been able to look into other tumors,&quot; she said. &quot;It is now clear Rb is involved not only in retinoblastoma, but also in osteosarcoma (a bone tumor), lung cancer and breast cancer.&quot;    While it will be years before the study yields practical results, such work contributes to the belief that it may one day be possible to screen people for genetic susceptibility to certain tumors, and thus to warn them to avoid the carcinogens that take advantage of their vulnerability. </TEXT></DOC>
