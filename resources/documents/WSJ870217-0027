The maker of immune therapies said revenue more than tripled to $3.1 million from $875,000.    Immunex said it expects to post a loss for 1986 of $1.4 million, compared with a loss of $4.4 million in 1985. Revenue nearly tripled to $9.5 million from $3.2 million a year ago.    Stephen A. Duzan, president and chief executive officer, said revenue from contract research more than doubled and that interest income also increased.    Mr. Duzan said 1986 was a &quot;satisfying&quot; year because the company had several products in clinical trials, and gained financial strength. &quot;And we expect 1987 will be even stronger,&quot; he added.    The company has clinical trials in progress for three products: interleukin-2, an immune system modulator being tested against cancer; a monoclonal antibody to fight graft-vs.-host disease in bone marrow transplant recipients; and GM-CSF, a protein that stimulates the growth of blood cells. The latter product is seen as a possible defense against cancer.    Mr. Duzan said the company expects to begin clinical trials for three more products this year: a vaccine adjuvant, or compound designed to boost the immune response generated by vaccines; interleukin-1, an immuno-modulator thought to be of potential use as a burn and wound-healing agent; and bovine interleukin-2, a possible treatment for viral inflammations in dairy cattle. </TEXT></DOC>
