Voters will decide Nov. 8 whether to keep the tough law passedthis spring designed to ban cheap handguns known as Saturday NightSpecials.   Still smarting from congressional rejection last month of a billrequiring a seven-day waiting period before anyone can obtain ahandgun, gun control advocates hope a yes vote in Maryland willrally their movement and provide encouragement for gun controlbattles in the New Jersey and Florida legislatures.   The campaign has embroiled the National Rifle Association, stategun clubs, the Roman Catholic church, the black community, mostmajor law enforcement officials and Gov. William Donald Schaefer ina struggle characterized by charges of racism and misrepresentation.   ``There is a sort of tidal effect that comes and goes on issueslike this,'' said Michael Beard, director of the National Coalitionto Ban Handguns. ``If they (the NRA) lose a couple of battles thenthey lose a lot of their power.''   The NRA has devoted $3 million to the repeal effort, outspendingthe law's supporters by 10-1.   ``Either way it goes it's going to have some impacts in otherstates. If it's lost it doesn't mean other states are automaticallygoing to follow suit. We've been successful in blocking otherattempts, but it would be an impetus,'' said Richard Gardiner, theNRA's assistant general counsel.   Barbara Lautman, spokeswoman for Handgun Control Inc., chargedthe referendum has become a ``test of how much money it will takethe NRA to distort the truth. If we lose in Maryland, it will meanthat once again the NRA's millions won out over common sense.''   The law's supporters are counting on the vigorous support ofSchaefer and other well-known Marylanders. Schaefer has tapedtelevision spots that denounce the NRA for interference.   Four other states have laws banning cheap handguns _ Illinois,Minnesota, South Carolina and Hawaii _ but Maryland's is uniquebecause it doesn't define what constitutes a Saturday NightSpecial, leaving that task to a nine-member board appointed by thegovernor.   The Handgun Roster Board is required to compile a list ofhandguns with legitimate recreation and personal security uses thatmay be sold in the state after Jan. 1, 1990. The law also bans thenew breed of mostly plastic guns that can't be detected by securitydevices in airports and courthouses.   The board has become the major substantive issue in the debate,with opponents contending it would have authority to outlaw allhandguns, a charge supporters say is false.   Charges of racism have been leveled against the pro-gun forces,who are appealing to black voters with the argument that banningcheap handguns would deprive the poor of their right to protectthemselves against crime.   The Most Rev. John H. Ricard, a leading black Roman Catholicclergyman in Baltimore, described the tactic as ``a poorly veiledattempt to pit blacks against the majority. That's offensive to allcitizens. This ugly racist campaign thrust should be ended atonce.''   The Catholic church has been criticized for its high-profilesupport for the law. One pro-gun leader urged parishioners to dropspent bullet cartridges in collection baskets to protest thechurch's stance. There were no reports of anyone doing so.   Among the law-enforcement leaders endorsing the gun ban areAttorney General J. Joseph Curran, Secretary of Public SafetyBishop L. Robinson, the state branch of the Fraternal Order ofPolice, and associations of state troopers, sheriffs and chiefs ofpolice.   George Young, the California political consultant directing therepeal campaign, summed up the opposition argument: ``Americanshave an inalienable right to self defense ... the right of peopleto purchase the handgun of their choice. History tells us you loseyour rights in increments. This is an increment we intend tooppose.''</TEXT></DOC>
