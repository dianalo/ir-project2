(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Farm Bureau worker armed with tworifles, a pistol and gasoline held 13 people hostage at a bureauoffice but released them unharmed and surrendered today after beingtold he could meet with a bureau executive.   The gunman, identified as M.L. Shaw, walked into the Farm Bureauoffice in this southern Mississippi town of 9,000 about 7 p.m.Tuesday and freed the last of his hostages about 2:30 a.m. afternegotiations with two clergymen and the police chief, police said.   ``They persuaded him he was going to have his hearing,'' MayorSteve Pittman said.   ``I'm pleased it was handled where nobody was injured,'' he said.``Obviously, after many hours he was obviously tired.''   Seven men and a woman _ the bureau manager, the president andmembers of the board of directors, the board secretary and the boardpresident's son _ were held for 7{ hours. Four hostages werereleased earlier because of age and health problems. Another escapedsoon after Shaw walked into the Farm Bureau office brandishing hisweapons and carrying two 5-gallon containers of gasoline.   During the siege, Shaw had the office secretary call authoritieson the telephone to relay his demands.   Pittman said Shaw was never specific in his demands other than tosay he wanted to speak with a Farm Bureau executive.   Anna Nixon, an employee of the bi-weekly Columbian Progressnewspaper, said one of four men released early on, Ed Kendrick, hadidentified the man as a former manager of the Farm Bureau office.   ``He is demanding seven years' back pay and that's the number ofyears since the man apparently left the Farm Bureau,'' Nixon said.   Police Chief Joe Sanders said Shaw, who lives in the Bunker Hillcommunity just outside of Columbia, had worked at the Farm Bureauoffice for about 25 years, and left about seven years ago because ofhis health.   After the hostages were released, authorities escorted Shaw outof the building to take him to meet with an official of the stateFarm Bureau's office who was en route from Ruleville, Pittman said.   Authorities didn't say what charges, if any, would be filedagainst Shaw.   However, Sheriff Webbie McKenzie said Shaw would be taken to theState Hospital at Whitfield, a mental hospital.</TEXT></DOC>
