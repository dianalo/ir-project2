A 1-ms, 25-kW,15.5-GHz microwave pulse resonant with the second harmonic of the electroncyclotron frequency (w = 2w/sub ce/) was injected into one end plug (eastplug) of the tandem mirror. The combined electron and ion energy increasedup to 400 eV in the east plug and 140 eV in the west plug. Thomson-scatteringelectron-temperature measurements and neutral energy analyzer measurementsshowed that the most of the plug plasma energy increases were due toincreases in ion energy. An ion-energy-rate equation model was used toshow that the ion energy increases were due to a reduction in the electrondrag losses on the ions. Hot electrons (T/sub e,hot/ {le} 6 keV) weredetected in the east plug by x-ray and cyclotron-emission diagnostics.Measurements of the line density in the plugs and local density by centralcell probes showed that the plasma column shifted off-axis a distancecomparable to the plasma radius ({similar_to} 12 cm) as a result of theapplication of the microwave RF pulse. The shift was in the directiontowards the microwave antenna and the ICRF antennas.</TEXT></DOC>
