This is the first time the World Bank has created a trustfund to aid a non-member country. The bank said the new fundwill finance advisory services to help the Soviets implementan economic reform plan, develop &quot;market-oriented policies,&quot;and protect &quot;vulnerable groups during the transition to amarket economy.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In addition, the fund will finance services to helpdevelop agriculture, energy, housing and other keyindustries.   The bank's board of executive directors was scheduled toconsider a similar proposal last week, but postponed itsplans after the coup attempt was launched in the SovietUnion. In the wake of the coup's collapse, the bank alteredits plan, emphasizing that aid could go either to the centralgovernment or to breakaway republics.   World Bank President Barber Conable said the fund &quot;canmake a valuable contribution to the integration of the SovietUnion into the world economy, to the evolution of itseconomic system, and {to} an improved quality of life for theSoviet people.&quot;   The modest World Bank plan grows out of the economicsummit of leading industrial nations in London earlier thissummer. At that summit, leaders rejected any direct financialaid to the Soviet Union. But they endorsed technicalassistance to the Soviets, as well as associate status forthem in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.Associate status would allow technical assistance but wouldrule out any direct loans.   After the summit, however, Mr. Gorbachev requested fullmembership in the IMF and World Bank; in the wake of lastweek's failed coup, some European leaders have said they areinclined to support that request. The Bush administrationcontinues to resist plans for full IMF and World Bankmembership. British Prime Minister John Major is expected todiscuss the issue with Mr. Bush at a meeting scheduled todayat the president's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine.   IMF officials say that current confusion in the SovietUnion could complicate the membership question. The problem,they say, is who the member would be. Soviet republics arerapidly claiming their independence, which means each wouldhave to apply to the IMF separately. But to join the IMF,countries must undergo a complete economic review, andconducting such a review of breakaway republics that don'thave even rudimentary economic statistics could provecomplicated and time-consuming.   A delegation of Soviet officials is expected to come toWashington next week to begin discussions with the IMF andthe World Bank.</TEXT></DOC>
