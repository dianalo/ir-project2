WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   What happens in New Hampshire may decide whoamong the Democratic presidential candidates get to go South withJesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr., while Pat Robertson is lookingforward to the first Republican contest in the South no matter whathappens Tuesday.   Analysts say that Robertson, who in Iowa pushed up betweenfront-runners Bob Dole and George Bush, will be on his friendliestturf when the presidential season moves into its Southern phase. InNew Hampshire, polls put him in a dead heat for third place withRep. Jack Kemp of New York and former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont.   Contests are scheduled in Wyoming, South Dakota and a handful ofother states in the three weeks after Tuesday's New Hampshireprimary.   The next main event is the Super Tuesday primary across most ofthe South and in several other states on March 8, but the SouthCarolina primary three days before that could emerge as a crucialGOP test.   ``There's tremendous potential for Robertson to be a spoilerhere,'' said Earl Black, political scientist at the University ofSouth Carolina. ``He's putting a lot of money and organizationaleffort into South Carolina. He's thrown down the gauntlet, and Ithink he's in position to back that up.''   On the Democratic side, the presidential race in the South willbe shaped by New Hampshire's results.   Iowa winner Richard Gephardt hopes that a second-place finishbehind local favorite Michael Dukakis, governor of neighboringMassachusetts, will propel the Missouri congressman into a strongposition to face the South's native son, Gore of Tennessee.   A Gephardt finish behind Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois andDukakis, however, could leave the field still muddled as it turnsSouth _ a page right out of Gore's script.   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart and former Arizona Gov. BruceBabbitt have been polling at the bottom of the Democratic pack inNew Hampshire, and are hoping Tuesday for surprising finishes tokeep their faltering campaigns alive long enough for Super Tuesday.   Already, there are signs of bad blood between the rivalcampaigns of Gephardt and Gore, who is competing in New Hampshirebut has reserved most of his money for the Southern campaign. BothDemocrats have designs on the white, moderate-to-conservativeDemocratic vote in the South.   Gephardt's campaign manager William Carrick used harsh languageto the Washington Post last week about Gore. He said: ``I can'twait. It's blood lust. Let me at him. I hate him. I hate all ofthem.''   The Gore campaign said Sunday that Carrick ``formally apologizedtoday...for profane, personal attacks and comments critical of Goreand and Gore's campaign.'' The apologies were made to both Gorehimself and campaign manager Fred Martin, said Arlie Schardt, presssecretary for the Gore campaign.   ``Both Gore and Martin accepted the apology and agreed withCarrick that the matter was over,'' Schardt said in a statement.   Martin said the campaign remains convinced the influence of Iowaand New Hampshire will be diminished this year by Gore's chosenbattleground, the South.   South Carolina Republicans, dominated by loyalists to Bush, setup their primary on Saturday March 5 in hopes it would give thevice president a boost in case he needed it before the SuperTuesday primaries in the rest of the South.   But now Robertson, a former TV evangelist who lives in WestVirginia, has targeted South Carolina as his next best chance andpredicted he will win it outright.   Robertson's strong Iowa second-place finish behind Dole, handingBush a humiliating third place, was explained in part byRobertson's strong organization among fundamentalist andcharismatic Christian voters and the traditionally low turnout ofcaucus contests. In South Carolina he has a primary rather than acaucus, but one with a history of low turnout and a Bible-beltlocation favorable to his message.   ``Using those evangelical churches and his high-tech methods toget his people out, and rolling the church buses on Saturday, hecan find a lot of voters,'' Black said.   Elsewhere in the South, Republicans say Robertson maydemonstrate a strength not detected in the polls.   ``Robertson will probably come in second in Georgia _ if hedoesn't come in first,'' said Bob Bell, former Georgia GOP statechairman.   ``This is the Bible Belt,'' he said. ``I think really there issomething happening.''   Bush is credited with a Southern organization far superior tothat of Dole, and polls show him far and away the Southern leader.But a loss in New Hampshire to the Senate majority leader fromKansas could leave Bush struggling to hang on to both hisorganization and his poll lead.   ``Bush has to look ahead,'' said Norm Ornstein, politicalanalyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ``He hascrafted what may be a Maginot Line: `If we do badly in Iowa, we'vegot New Hampshire. If we do badly there, we've got South Carolina...' If Pat Robertson takes away a victory from him in SouthCarolina, that's it.''   Bush's southern co-ordinator Lanny Griffith, however, insiststhat Bush can remain strong in the South even with another setback .   ``Frankly, we don't have any bad states in the South,'' Griffithsaid. ``We lead in every state. We lead in every demographic group,among conservatives and independents. There is no region (of theSouth) or demographic group where we don't lead.''   Dole is at an organizational disadvantage in the South but hashad his wife, Elizabeth, a native of North Carolina, working theregion for him. Her home state is considered a key strength forDole in the South.   Dole's Southern spokesman, Clark Reid, claimed ``a groundswellof support'' following Iowa. ``You have to take into account wehaven't done any paid media (ads) yet in the South,'' Reid said.</TEXT></DOC>
