One of two engines on the Centaur second stage failed toignite a few minutes after an April 18 launch from CapeCanaveral, Fla., forcing controllers on the ground to blow upthe rocket. The rocket was carrying a satellite for theJapanese public broadcasting company NHK, and its failuredamped Japan's ambitions for beginning the world's firstcommercial broadcasting of high-definition television thisyear.</LP><TEXT>   General Dynamics said an oversight review board itassembled of government and industry experts concluded thatthe Centaur's engine turbopump began to rotate but thenseized, probably because of some sort of foreign object.   A spokesman for the Pratt andamp; Whitney unit of UnitedTechnologies Corp., which makes the Centaur's engine, saidthe company had cooperated with the General Dynamicsinvestigation and &quot;we support the findings.&quot; The spokesmansaid the launch failure hasn't affected its backlog of ordersfor 100 such engines from General Dynamics, its primarycustomer. He noted that until the April launch failure,&quot;We've had 100% reliability since this engine was firstlaunched in 1963. It's performed flawlessly.&quot; Pratt andamp; Whitneyhas sent 178 such engines into space.   General Dynamics said two other reasons for the potentialfailure were cited but were less likely. It mentionedpossible low torque at the start of the engine turbine'srotation. Also, it said water, ice or frozen nitrogen in theengine turbopump could have played a role.   A General Dynamics spokesman said the company has moved toboost the number of X-ray and other inspections of therockets. It said it has increased the torque margin, as wellas instituting a warmer engine pre-chill temperature and amodified ignition sequence on the rocket.   The spokesman said it has commitments for 25 commerciallaunches, two of which will be completed later this year. Inan announcement, General Dynamics said that despite thefailure, it &quot;remains committed to the launch-vehicle businessand is taking aggressive risk-mitigation and preventiveaction to ensure its commercial and government customers ofreliable launch services.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
