It's the kind of slash-and-burn performance that's earned the Democrats their reputation for defense weakness. A Ronald Reagan veto would remind voters that there really is a difference between the two parties on national security.    Senator Sam Nunn gave a speech in Atlanta claiming the Democrats favor a &quot;strong&quot; military, but in conference on the fiscal 1989 defense bill Mr. Nunn was rolled by the left wing of his party's House Caucus. &quot;Unlike previous years in which the conference tended toward the weaker positions of the Senate,&quot; boasted a press release from Rep. Les Aspin's House Armed Services Committee, &quot;this year the conference positions leaned decidedly toward the stronger positions traditionally taken by the House.&quot;    But &quot;stronger&quot; to House Democrats means weaker for the nation. &quot;Senate and House conferees today took the stars out of Star Wars,&quot; claimed the same press release, &quot;slashing funds for space-based defenses.&quot;    Specifically, the conferees authorized only $3.7 billion for SDI -- a cut from this year adjusting for inflation. The administration had already trimmed its SDI request by some $1.8 billion to nearly $5 billion in order to comply with last year's budget &quot;summit&quot; accord, and the Senate approved about $4.5 billion. But the Democratic left has made opposition to SDI a litmus test for congressional leadership, so Mr. Aspin was only too happy to take out his bolo knife.    When it comes to pork barrel, on the other hand, the Democrats could be more than generous. The conferees mandated that the Pentagon spend $225 million of that straitened SDI budget for a ground-based, free-electron laser project being developed in New Mexico. It should surprise no one that Democratic Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico faces a tough reelection fight this year. In other micromanagement decisions, the conferees gutted the administration's request for the MX missile rail system but boosted funding for the far more costly Midgetman. The technology already exists for the MX, but Midgetman -- critics call it &quot;Congressman&quot; -- happens to be a pet project of Mr. Aspin's.    On arms control, the House Democrats chose to assist Mikhail Gorbachev at the bargaining table. The conferees ordered that two Poseidon submarines be retired from service a year earlier than scheduled, a pointless attempt to abide by the SALT II treaty that the Senate never ratified. They also required the Defense Department to report to Congress on the merits of a ban on the testing of low-flying ballistic missiles -- and, within 60 days of filing that report, to prohibit U.S. tests so long as the Soviets also don't test. Why should the Soviets make concessions when Congress unilaterally binds a U.S. President?    The package adds up to a hanging slider for the Reagan administration. Defense Secretary Carlucci laid out his concerns earlier this month in a letter to congressional conferees, but now we hear he's decided to defer to Defense Secretary Aspin. For his part, Vice President Bush might consider this bill a golden opportunity to resurrect the defense issue that the Democrats seem so intent on muddling. No matter how many times Michael Dukakis utters &quot;strength&quot; on the stump, this defense bill shows what his party does these days in practice. </TEXT></DOC>
