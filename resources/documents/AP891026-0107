(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chippewa Indians rejected a $35.6million offer to give up traditional spearfishing practices thatanger sport fishermen, prompting one tribal leader to remark, ``TheGreat Spirit won.''   The Indians of the Lac du Flambeau Reservation voted 439-366Wednesday night against a state of Wisconsin proposal to settle adispute over a 19th century treaty that gives the tribe rights tofish, hunt and cut timber off their reservation.   The settlement would have paid each member of the Lac duFlambeau band $1,800 cash this year and $1,200 in each of the next10 years. The $35.6 million, 10-year settlement offer included $15million in state and federal aid for Indian programs.   ``I feel great,'' said tribe member Scott Smith, who joined thedrum-pounding, cheering opponents of the treaty outside the centerwhere the votes were counted. ``They saved our rights.''   The Chippewas' annual spearfishing forays, during the spring runof walleye pike, have become the focus of protest by non-Indiansport anglers. They say Indians spearing fish in shallow water havean unfair advantage over others, who must use rod and reel.   The battle heated up this year after the state announced itwould reduce walleye pike catch limits for sport anglers. The cutfollowed a federal court ruling the Chippewa could catch up to 100percent of the number of the pike which biologists determine can besafely taken from the lakes.   Demonstrations against spearfishing erupted last spring, and 200were arrested.   Gov. Tommy Thompson called the rejected settlement, which wouldhave required the approval of the Legislature, the best hope ofending friction in northern Wisconsin.   ``It's done, it's dead,'' Thompson said. ``It had to be ratifiedby the tribe or it's done. ... We're going to have to review all ofour options.''   Lac du Flambeau Chairman Mike Allen said before the vote thatthe band wouldn't resume negotiations with the state if the tribedefeated the referendum.   ``That's the end of the trail here for us. It's over right now.The people made their choice,'' Allen said today.   He predicted that one consequence of the vote will be moreviolent protests next spring when tribe members leave thereservation to spearfish again.   ``I believe it's going to get worse,'' he said. ``It's beengetting worse every year and we anticipate it for this (next)year.''   Tribal attorney James Jannetta announced he was resigningbecause defeat of the settlement he negotiated was a clear messagehis services were no longer wanted.   ``The Great Spirit won over tonight,'' said Thomas Maulson, aformer tribal judge and leading opponent of the settlement.   Federal courts have ruled since 1983 that the state's sixChippewa bands retain the hunting, fishing and gathering rightsunder 19th century treaties that ceded northern Wisconsin to thefederal government.   The Lac du Flambeau, with about 2,500 members, is traditionallythe most active Chippewa band in spearfishing.   So far, the state has failed to reach treaty rights settlementswith any of the Chippewa bands. The Mole Lake band rejected aproposed settlement in January.   Tribal council member Dave Vetterneck said after the vote: ``Thepeople spoke for what they wanted. As far as I'm concerned, therewill be no more negotiations.''   Opponents of the agreement demonstrated outside the tribecenter, and security was tight as votes were cast, but there wereno disturbances.</TEXT></DOC>
