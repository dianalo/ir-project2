Take the battle going on between Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and a one-time client, hotel investor John B. Coleman andamp; Co. After the big investment bank withdrew a &quot;highly confident&quot; letter pledging to raise $95 million for Coleman, which has stakes in Ritz-Carlton hotels in New York and Washington, D.C., as well as in Chicago's Tremont and Whitehall hotels, the two sides have filed lawsuits in federal bankruptcy court over $3.5 million in fees Morgan says it's still owed.    And Morgan isn't getting much sympathy from a judge who says Morgan seems to have taken actions that appear &quot;without precedent&quot; on Wall Street.    Burton J. Lifland, the chief U.S. bankruptcy judge in Manhattan, told Morgan's lawyers in court they were pursuing &quot;a very interesting course where the entire investment banking community and {its} involvement in bankruptcy proceedings are going to be brought into question.&quot; Judge Lifland presided over the Coleman company's emergence from proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in August and is scheduled to hear the Morgan suit later this month.    The legal tiff marks one of the rare occasions when a major investment bank has withdrawn a &quot;highly confident&quot; letter, which in financial circles has become accepted as a virtual guarantee of a financing. These letters, pioneered by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., state that an investment bank is &quot;highly confident&quot; it can raise funds for a client, although the pledge isn't legally binding.    &quot;In principle, the receipt of a highly-confident letter gives the person who gets it a great deal of confidence; it's highly unusual when one is withdrawn,&quot; said Roderick Hills, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a board member at Drexel and a partner at the Washington-based law firm of Donovan Leisure Newton andamp; Irving. Mr. Hills stressed that he isn't familiar with the facts of the Coleman case. Both Morgan Stanley and the Coleman company declined to comment publicly on the suit. But a person familiar with Morgan Stanley's position said its battle with Coleman &quot;is nothing more than a routine legal dispute that isn't going to reveal a lot about Morgan Stanley.&quot; Friends of John B. Coleman, head of the firm bearing his name, say he is so incensed by what he considers shabby treatment that he's determined to get even.    The 54-year-old Mr. Coleman's closely held company has been sued on numerous occasions by construction concerns alleging unpaid debts. At the time of the company's bankruptcy-law filing in 1986, the Coleman company owed back taxes on its hotels in Chicago, the District of Columbia and New York. Most of the suits have been settled out of court, and Coleman says it is now current on its tax bills.    Mr. Coleman also has admirers. &quot;I've known John Coleman for more than 20 years as a friend and businessman and he's a fine gentleman,&quot; said Alfred Taubman, a Detroit-based industrialist.    Mr. Coleman &quot;doesn't have many friends and sometimes he's wrong,&quot; said Joseph Grosz, chief executive officer of Property Investors Corp., a mortgage banker and developer who worked with the Coleman company. &quot;But John is right this time. I don't know what Morgan's game was. It came very close to jeopardizing his empire. I've never heard of a firm withdrawing a highly confident letter.&quot;    Mr. Coleman's problems started in mid-1986 when his company was hit with a potentially devastating lawsuit by Integrated Resources Inc. Federal tax-law changes had wiped out many of the benefits of limited partnerships, adversely affecting partnerships tied to Coleman's hotels in Chicago. Integrated and PaineWebber Inc. had sold interests in the partnerships to their customers.    Integrated sued the Coleman company in state court in Cook County, Ill., claiming it actually owned Coleman's properties instead of a portion of their revenues. The Coleman company filed for protection under Chapter 11, saying this was the only way to get the dispute into federal court, where Coleman wanted it decided.    The Coleman company hired Morgan Stanley to help settle the Integrated suit and to prepare a plan to take the Coleman company out of Chapter 11 through financings and restructurings. Morgan's retainer fee for being Coleman's investment banker from June 1987 through December 1988 was $500,000, not including fees for any resulting financings or sales.    Within a year, the Coleman company worked out a settlement with Integrated that preserved Coleman's control over its properties. None of Morgan's proposed financings panned out, however. Last November, a month before its contract with Coleman expired, Morgan said in a letter to Coleman that it was &quot;confident&quot; it could arrange a first-mortgage note financing totaling between $90 million and $95 million.    A similar letter was sent in January, in which Morgan altered some of the terms and said that it was now &quot;highly confident&quot; it could place the first-mortgage notes, which are debt securities secured by the property of the issuer. Coleman had received financing offers from other concerns, including Southmark and a unit of Salomon Inc., but it accepted the Morgan proposal because it was the most attractive financially, according to court testimony and investment bankers familiar with the financing proposals. A committee of creditors formed by the bankruptcy court also approved the Morgan Stanley financing, as did Judge Lifland.    Then the bottom fell out. In a meeting with Mr. Coleman in late February -- a month after it sent its highly confident letter -- Morgan Stanley said it couldn't arrange the financing, according to people who attended the meeting. In a March 2 letter, Morgan then formally withdrew its offer and instead proposed a financing totaling between $60 million to $70 million &quot;subject to further review and analysis.&quot; The letters are among documents submitted to the court.    By suddenly backing out of the financing, Morgan threw the Coleman company's reorganization plan into confusion and prompted the court to consider appointing a replacement for Mr. Coleman as the custodian for the company.    Mr. Coleman scrambled. &quot;When the Morgan Stanley highly confident letter was withdrawn, {Mr.} Coleman felt he had lost it all,&quot; said Mr. Grosz of Property Investors. &quot;He had dropped other financing offers. So at that point, he was faced with real problems.&quot;    Mr. Coleman persuaded Mohammed Hadid, a Washington, D.C., real estate developer who says he had been introduced by Mr. Grosz last November, to assume a much larger role in financing the Coleman company's reorganization. But Morgan Stanley thought it was entitled to a fee for the financing agreement between Hadid Corp. and the Coleman company.    In a March 27 letter to Mr. Coleman, Morgan said it expected to be paid, &quot;since it was through our sole efforts that you were introduced to Hadid.&quot; The next day, Morgan sent Mr. Coleman a bill for $3,166,825 -- $3 million of which was a 2% commission for a $150 million proposed financing arranged by Hadid and the Coleman company. Mr. Coleman dismissed the bill. Morgan sued and Coleman countersued.    Mr. Hadid said &quot;Morgan Stanley played no role&quot; in his introduction to Mr. Coleman last fall or in any subsequent meetings. Morgan &quot;did not introduce the {financing} plan to John Coleman or me, and I and my representatives had no dealings with Morgan Stanley regarding this proposed transaction.&quot;    Mr. Grosz agrees. &quot;Morgan Stanley never picked up the phone to introduce Coleman to Hadid by phone or in person,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm the one who introduced them. In fact, Mohammed Hadid didn't have any interest in Coleman&quot; while the Coleman company employed Morgan Stanley. &quot;But it took me a quite a while to convince him to have lunch {with Mr. Coleman}, and it went from there,&quot; Mr. Grosz added.    In court, Morgan's claim also surprised Judge Lifland. &quot;You are asking for commissions on a deal that is not a done deal,&quot; he told Morgan's lawyers. &quot;I suggest that you are marching down the wrong avenue here.&quot;    Among other things, the judge said, &quot;the confidence of all parties with respect to Morgan Stanley has been somewhat eroded with respect to Morgan's withdrawal of its 'highly confident letter' which has thrown this estate into somewhat of a tailspin and tizzy.&quot;    The Coleman company's emergence from Chapter 11, made possible by financing from the Hadid concern, was approved by the court last month.    What particularly upset Judge Lifland was Morgan's insistence in court that its highly confident letter was created by the Coleman company. In an apparently sarcastic question, Judge Lifland asked one of Morgan's attorneys if the letter is &quot;an invention of the investment banking community?&quot;    Morgan Stanley attorney: &quot;No, this is an investment, frankly, in this context this --&quot;    Judge Lifland: &quot;Not investment. Invention.&quot;    Morgan Stanley: &quot;This was an invention, I believe you will find, of Mr. Coleman and his drafters and not of Morgan Stanley.&quot;    Judge Lifland: &quot;You mean Coleman writes 'highly confident' in the draft and Morgan adopts it?&quot;    Morgan Stanley: &quot;In this context --&quot;    Judge Lifland: &quot;So that this is Coleman's highly confident letter and not Morgan Stanley's?&quot;    Morgan Stanley: &quot;The language, in fact, came from {Coleman} based upon the information then available to Morgan Stanley --&quot;    Judge Lifland: &quot;I feel like Alice in Wonderland. I have never been to the tea party before. This is a walk through the mirror. I am learning. I thank you for it, counselor.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
