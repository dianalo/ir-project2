<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-08-1229 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report describes several numerical models developed for the detailedsimulation of solar energy systems by several member countries of theInternational Energy Agency (IEA) Task VI, namely Australia, Canada,the Netherlands, the USA and West Germany. The intended use for thesemodels varies depending on topics of interest to the individual membersand this is reflected in the capabilities of each model. Some of themodels are restricted to simulating particular systems of subsystemswhereas others are more general in their application. Between them, theycover a wide range of possible solar applications, namely; space heating/cooling,domestic hot water (DHW), industrial process heating (IPH) and districtheating systems. The purposes of this report are documentation of thesevaries models and validation of the models against measured results.29 refs., 56 figs., 21 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
