Felix Rohatyn, 62, said he would step down as chairman of theMunicipal Assistance Corp. by the end of the year to spend moretime with his wife, Elizabeth, who is recovering from recentsurgery.   The assistance corporation was created in June 1975 to assistthe city financially by using sales tax revenues to back bondsissued by the city. New York was near bankruptcy at the time andRohatyn was one of the architects of its recovery.   Rohatyn, also a member of the city's Council of EconomicAdvisers, criticized union leaders demanding ``unrealistic'' payhikes from the city.   Rohatyn suggested that pension money now earmarked for ateachers' pay raise instead go into city coffers.   Rohatyn, who has no direct say in the contract negotiations,said the state's fiscal problems and ``a much more serious'' citybudget crisis prompted him to speak out at the oversight group'smeeting Wednesday.   The problems are financial, economic and social and are ofproportions that ``I haven't seen in 40 years,'' said Rohatyn.   On Oct. 1, the city gave the United Federation of Teachers a 5.5percent pay increase in a one-year contract. The increase waspredicated on rearranging the city's pension contribution to theteachers retirement fund and making a more optimistic forecast ofthe dividends earned.   Rohatyn said that if the rearranged city contribution results inextra money, it should go to help New York.   ``Credible fiscal balance is necessary for full and free accessto the credit markets. Social balance dictates the fewest number oflayoffs possible,'' he said in a letter to City Council SpeakerPeter Vallone and the Financial Control Board.   ``Both objectives will be served by dedicating whatever pensionsavings are deemed prudent to ... the framework of an overallcomprehensive city financial plan.''   UFT President Sandra Feldman said Rohatyn ``is really meddlingwith things that are not really his affair.''   Mayor David Dinkins said later Wednesday that if the stateLegislature fails to pprove changes in pension earningsassumptions to finance half of the raise, the city would not beliable for the difference.   Rohatyn said similar demands from other unions are ``pushing thecity closer and closer to a real crisis.''   However, Barry Feinstein, president of Teamsters Local 237,which represents 12,000 city workers, said pension assumptions wereraised four times during Mayor Ed Koch's administration, the lasttime to balance the budget. Dinkins succeeded Koch in January.   Among the problems cited by Rohatyn are a $1.8 billion budgetgap already plugged for fiscal 1991 and a predicted shortfall of atleast $2 billion through fiscal 1992.   Standard andamp; Poors Corp. last week placed the city on its ``creditwatch'' list, meaning the bond rating agency is reviewing thecity's ability to pay interest and principal on $13 billion ingeneral obligation bonds. It did not change its bond rating for thecity.   There are potential layoffs of city workers and city agenciesare preparing to cut $1 billion over the next 21 months.   Officials predict a statewide budget deficit of up to $3 billionin the fiscal year starting April 1, 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
