The disclosure, made in a Securities andamp; Exchange Commission filing, comes on the heels of a recent filing disclosing that a group led by Sumner M. Redstone, chairman and executive officer of National Amusements Inc. and Viacom Inc. raised its stake in Orion to the equivalent of 25.1% of the common shares outstanding.    Mr. Redstone and executives of Secaucus, N.J.-based Metromedia couldn't be reached for comment. But both groups have said that their purchases are for investment purposes only and that they may acquire additional shares from time to time. Orion executives declined comment, although Metromedia's chairman, John W. Kluge, is regarded as a friend to Orion Chairman Arthur Krim.    The recent moves by both groups have kindled speculation on Wall Street about Orion's future. John Tinker, an analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. said Metromedia was a likely buyer because it has large cash reserves from the sale if its television stations. Mr. Redstone, by contrast, is under pressure to sell certain assets to raise cash to pay off debt associated with his purchase of Viacom last year. </TEXT></DOC>
