(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Matter can be held together by intenselight, providing a potentially useful way to craft novel materials,researchers said.   The scientists found they could organize randomly arrangedmicroscopic beads into new structures that lasted as long as theywere bathed in the intense light.   The practical applications of this observation are stillunclear, although experts said it could play a role in devising newmethods of optical communications or in arranging molecules to makedrugs and other products.   The study was carried out on tiny plastic beads just 1.43microns, or 0.000057 inch in diameter. Under the light, they movedtoward each other in hops of 0.387 micron, or 0.000015 inch.   ``The spheres act like miniature antennas that pick up and thenre-radiate light,'' said Harvard physicist Jene Golovchenko. ``Thisscattered light combines with that coming directly from the laser,giving rise to force fields that bound the small spheres togetherin space. The length and strength of the bonding are controlled bythe intensity and wavelength of the laser light.''   Golovchenko conducted the research with Michael Burns andJean-Marc Fournier of the Rowland Institute in Cambridge. It waspublished recently in Physical Review Letters.   The researchers said that until now, the only known way to bindmatter was by atoms exchanging electrons. The newly discoveredprocess seems to work by exchanging packets of light known asphotons.   The light-assembled structures fall apart as soon as the laseris switched off. However, Golovchenko said that light might be usedto align molecules in novel ways, and then they could be madepermanent by freezing or chemical processes.   The researchers observed the interaction by putting water-soakedbeads between plates of glass and then shining a laser on them.   ``The spheres did a kind of dance, hopping between boundstates,'' said Golovchenko, producing an interaction that hebelieved no one had witnessed before.</TEXT></DOC>
