Vonderhaar, assistant vice presidentof marketing for Intelligent Business Systems.andP;  After the product has beenported to DBMSes for VAX/VMS, it will be ported to Unix, he said.andM;Beyond VAXes, he said, his company will probably have &quot;a solution&quot; forDB2--IBM's DBMS for mainframes--by the end of 1990.andP;  The future product willprobably not run on IBM's MVS operating system, but will be part of aclient/server cooperative processing strategy, he said.andM;&quot;We're very focused and we don't want to dilute our efforts,&quot; Vonderhaarsaid.andM;The EasyTalk architecture consists of the English-based query system and adeveloper's toolkit.andP;  Users can arrange results with the Reporter, a facilityfor reformating the layout of a report.andM;Prices for EasyTalk range from $3,600 for lower-end MicroVAXes to $145,000for high-end VAXes.andM;Intelligent Business Systems can be contacted at 185 Plains Road, Milford, CT06460, (800) 733-3279.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
