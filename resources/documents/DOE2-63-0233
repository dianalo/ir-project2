The approachis worked out in detail for the case where the initial particle sizespectrum follows a {gamma}-distribution, and it is shown to be a viabletechnique as long as the initial volume fraction of particulate materialis not too large. The method is applied to several situations of interest,and is shown to give more accurate results (with marginally shorter computingtimes) than are given by the three-parameter log-normal or {gamma} distributiontrial functions.</TEXT></DOC>
