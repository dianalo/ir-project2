It cited problems in informingbattlefield commanders about the daily changes in the opponent's status --particularly providing photographic &quot;imagery&quot; about the damage done in bombingand battles.;    &quot;The morale and intentions of the Iraq forces and leaderswere obscure to us. Field commanders wanted more tactical reconnaissance andimagery,&quot; the report says.;    The report in essence confirms the complaintsmade during congressional testimony by the commander of the operation, Gen.Norman Schwarzkopf.;    The Desert Storm general said pilots were operatingwith target photographs that were more than a day old.;    The various servicebranches lacked a standardized system that would speed the exchange of suchdata, the general said. For example, problems existed in transmitting bombingtargets between the Air Force and Navy, he said.;    Schwarzkopf also saidthat by the time U.S. commanders received intelligence data, &quot;it had beencaveated, disagreed with, footnoted and watered down to the point thatestimates could have supported any outcome.&quot;;    He said there was someconfusion in battle damage assessment because officials at the intelligenceagencies believed they were in a better position to analyze the data thanmilitary commanders in the field.;    In an introduction to the study, DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney offered a similar assessment.;    &quot;We had difficultywith battle damage assessment and with communications inter-operability,&quot; hewrote. Inter-operability refers to the capabilities of the various services totransmit information and use it to cooperate on the battlefield.;    Cheneynoted that the much-applauded Patriot missile systems -- deployed for thefirst time in warfare and used to fend off Iraqi Scud missile attacks --&quot;worked, but imperfectly. Mobile missile hunting was difficult and costly; Wewill need to do better.&quot;;    &quot;We were ill-prepared at the start for defenseagainst biological weapons, even though Saddam possessed them,&quot; the reportstated.;    In a laundry list of faults, the report also said U.S. forces&quot;were not nearly good enough at clearing land and sea mines, especiallyshallow water mines. This might have imposed significant additional costs hadlarge scale amphibious operations been required.&quot;;    Helicopters, such as theArmy's top-of-the-line Apache, &quot;were maintained only with extra care in theharsh desert environment,&quot; the report stated.;    The report says U.S. forcesneed to have more heavy equipment transports -- the type that helped U.S.tanks sweep west around Kuwait and into Iraq. It also calls for improving themilitary's navigation systems to help troops find their way on thebattlefield, and ways to help identify friends from foes. The latter wouldhelp reduce so-called &quot;friendly fire&quot; deaths that result from troops attackingtheir own colleagues in the heat of battle.;    The report notes that much ofthe U.S. military's capability wasn't even tested in the war, given that therewas no submarine threat, no significant Iraqi surface ship navy, &quot;no effectiveattack by aircraft on our troops or on port and support facilities.&quot;;   &quot;Chemical warfare and biological warfare, though threatened, were neveremployed. American amphibious capabilities, though highly effective fordeterrence and deception, were not tested on a large scale under fire.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910716  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  668  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday July 16, 199100198153,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
