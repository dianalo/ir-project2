Plasma diagnostics and data analysis, andresults obtained in the usual mode of operation are discussed. Resultsof the matched screw-pinch mode are presented. In this mode, the biasfield and predischarge current are combined with the power-crowbar circuitsin such a way that Bt and Ip increase almost simultaneously to theirmaximum values in 0.5 msec at a nearly constant value of qI at the wall.For both modes, the time evolution of a typical discharge is shown.</TEXT></DOC>
