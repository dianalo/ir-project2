LOUIS -- Twenty years ago, William Ross, then aMcDonnell Douglas Corp. manager, proudly supervised the birthof the Air Force's F-15 Eagle, the hottest fighter of itsday. Now the gray-haired president of the company's fighterdivision here, Mr. Ross is presiding over the jet's probabledemise.   &quot;She's an old, old friend,&quot; the former test pilot saysforlornly, looking up at the bundles of black and red wiresdangling from the half-finished frame of an F-15, an aircraftthe Pentagon wants to kill.</LP><TEXT>   A thousand miles to the east, the future looks brighter.In a cramped Loral Corp. factory in a burned-out corner ofNew York City's borough of the Bronx, dozens of workers atmicroscopes and workbenches solder tiny circuits formissile-warning devices used in military cockpits. The ColdWar may have ended, but the Pentagon still wants highlysophisticated electronic equipment. So, Loral is investing$10 million in new machinery over the next three years andseeks to expand the plant's 700-person payroll.   &quot;The stuff we turn out is profitable, and people here feelpretty good about the backlog of firm orders,&quot; says RickMorgan, the plant manager.   The disparate fates of the two contractors underscore thecomplexity of the defense industry's steepest nosedive sinceWorld War II. Most of the industry, like McDonnell Douglas,faces bleak times. At next week's U.S.-Soviet summit,Presidents Bush and Gorbachev will nearly complete sweepingagreements to cut stocks of chemical and nuclear weapons. Bythe end of this decade -- barring a sharp deterioration inthe international climate -- Pentagon spending on new weaponsis likely to plummet 50%, and more than half a millionworkers probably will be laid off. Texas, New York and someNew England states will be hit especially hard.   But even in this difficult environment, surprisingly,there will be a fair number of successes and a few bigwinners. Visits to weapons plants across the country uncoverseveral major trends reshaping the defense industry,strangling some companies and helping others.   First, as nearly everybody knows, several major defensecontractors are struggling. By the end of the decade, one ortwo probably will be swallowed up or quit the businessaltogether. However, some giant defense companies will toughit out and probably emerge from the shakeout stronger thanever, with fewer competitors and bigger market shares.   Another trend is common-sensical but less noticed: Lackingthe cash cushion and other lines of business that wouldenable them to survive the cutbacks, many smaller defensecompanies will disappear. But here again, concerns in certainfavored niches will thrive -- most notably, makers of spacesystems, computer-related equipment, defense electronics andcommunications gear, and training simulation packages.   In addition, one rule of thumb divides defense contractorsboth big and small: Nearly all that supply the Army are introuble, while most big Navy suppliers should ride out thestorm. That's because lawmakers and Pentagon brass seemdetermined to maintain maritime superiority.   Little recognized is the simple fact that the industry isshrinking but not dying. Even in the post-Cold War world, asDefense Secretary Dick Cheney observes, &quot;we're still going tobe spending an awful lot of money on national security.&quot;   The shrinkage will occur slowly. For one thing, thePentagon's unprecedented $260 billion order backlog willcushion the blow and delay the bulk of layoffs for a fewyears. Also, political pork-barreling has a way of keepingoutdated weapons alive. Lacking a long-term strategy,Congress is reluctant to chop defense outlays as deeply asmany Pentagon critics are demanding.   The varying reactions of big defense companies areillustrated in the contrast between the nation's biggestdefense contractor, McDonnell Douglas, and thesecond-biggest, General Dynamics Corp. Both are based in St.Louis, but the similarities end there. McDonnell Douglas hassunk into confusion, torn between its history of being theindustry's top gun and its hopes of prospering by sellingmore commercial airliners. General Dynamics, meanwhile, seesa potential jackpot in the industry's contraction and issticking to its guns.   McDonnell Douglas executives talk a good game. &quot;We werethe No. 1 defense contractor in 1980 when the Pentagon budgetwas $150 billion,&quot; says Mr. Ross, the chief of the fighterdivision, &quot;and I intend to be the No. 1 defense contractor ifit goes back to $150 billion,&quot; half its present level. &quot;We'regoing to be a preferred supplier for the Defense Department,&quot;he vows, but then mutters, under his breath, &quot;If there issuch a thing these days.&quot;   Outsiders take a grimmer view. Dan Stanley, a formerMcDonnell Douglas executive who is now an aide to SenateMinority Leader Robert Dole, laments that the company'smilitary segment is practically &quot;struggling for itsexistence.&quot; Its cash-cow F-15 Eagle, designed in the early1970s, is in deep trouble, with the Pentagon proposing tostop buying it next fall, five years earlier than onceplanned.   So, like an ungainly battleship, McDonnell Douglas istrying to turn toward the civilian market. It hopes over thenext few years to increase such sales to half its revenuefrom one-third today. From Chairman John McDonnell on down,managers are concentrating on helping the company's troubledcommercial-aircraft factory in Long Beach, Calif., get planesout the door. Top executives say layoffs, by the end of the1990s, could hit as much as one-third of the St. Louisplant's 40,000 workers, and they hope to cushion the blow bybuilding parts for their commercial operations in California.&quot;Noses?&quot; Mr. Ross says. &quot;You want somebody to build noses foryou? We'll build them.&quot;   Yet reality still hasn't fully sunk in. McDonnell Douglasplays a major role in four of the government's five mostexpensive new-weapons products, but nobody at the companyconcedes that any of the programs are doomed.   The misery of defense giants such as McDonnell Douglas andNorthrop Corp., which makes the embattled B-2 Stealth bomber,may help a handful of other industry giants. As weaker rivalsbail out and the Pentagon goes back to doling out fatsingle-source contracts, several behemoths may well grabbigger pieces of the smaller defense-budget pie. Boeing Co.,for example, aims to keep its annual revenue from thePentagon steady at about $5 billion, and industry observersexpect it to succeed. Similarly, General Electric Co. plansto capitalize on its strong position producing nuclearreactors for submarines, Navy missiles and various spaceprojects.   The strong position of these likely winners is perhapsclearest at General Dynamics. With its diverse contracts andstrength in Navy work, General Dynamics can afford to shrugoff talk of turning to commercial markets. Chairman StanleyPace concedes that the company could be 30% smaller, in realterms, by the end of the decade. But with fewer competitors,he says, it also will be stronger. &quot;I look at a downturn asan opportunity,&quot; he declares. General Dynamics has been therebefore, skinnying down after the post-Vietnam defense cutbackand emerging, years later, stronger than ever.   Today, the company looks robust at both the big-ticket andmoderate-price ends of the Pentagon market. Carrying a $1.8billion price tag, its stealthy new attack submarine, theSeawolf, would seem a natural target for budget-cutters. Butso far, the Navy steadfastly argues that it must upgrade itssub fleet because of the Soviets' great technologicalstrides.   At the other end of the scale, the company's F-16 Falcon,though operational for nearly two decades, remains the onlyreliable, low-cost, single-engine fighter available. Despitetalk of winding down the line in the late 1990s, Mr. Pacethinks that an enhanced model could sell for many years,given the lack of competition.   Of course, some battles are looming. Secretary Cheney, inhis biggest swipe at the company, wants to shut down its M-1tank plants in Michigan and Ohio by early 1993 -- the onlytank factories still open in the U.S. But General Dynamicswill fight him, and it may have Congress on its side. &quot;Ifthey know for sure there are never going to be any more tankbattles in the world, then, swell, mothball the M-1,&quot; Mr.Pace says. &quot;But if they want to have some sort of aninsurance policy,&quot; he adds, the U.S. must keep building them.   &quot;The important thing&quot; for a company to do, he adds, is to&quot;stay calm, sweat it out and come through the best you can.&quot;   Pentagon planners, for example, want to stop buyingGeneral Dynamics' Tomahawk cruise missile in 1993. But thecompany may keep it alive by finding uses for it in additionto its original mission of flying nuclear warheads into WorldWar III. &quot;We want to highlight the Tomahawk's flexibility, toshow that this is the kind of thing you can use in Panama,&quot;says Brad Beaver, manager of the company's cruise-missilefactory in San Diego.   Mr. Beaver's efforts are typical of defense-industry movesto keep prized projects alive. Improvements will allow theTomahawk to fly more than 1,400 miles before hitting atarget, he says, &quot;even if it moves around, like Gadhafi'stent.&quot; The Navy connection helps here, too: Because theTomahawk is fired from submarine tubes or destroyer decks,General Dynamics contends that it will become more valuableas foreign bases disappear. Sea-based cruise missiles alsoare less likely to be trimmed in arms-control negotiations.   It's too early to say whether Mr. Beaver will win his caseon the Tomahawk, which brought General Dynamics $230 millionlast year -- about 2% of its sales. But no matter whathappens, the company isn't &quot;going to jump into a lot of newareas just to say we're there,&quot; says its chief financialofficer, Jim Cunnane.   At the opposite end of the industry are hundreds ofsmaller companies in the wrong lines, such as buildinginfantry equipment for the Army. They will be the biggestlosers in the shakeout.   At Harsco Corp.'s plant in York, Pa., for example,camouflage-painted armored vehicles growl and rumble aroundthe test track like so many dinosaurs. The equipment wasdesigned for a European land war that few now anticipate.   &quot;We have thought about getting out of the defense businessfor at least two years, but nobody wanted to buy,&quot; saysMalcolm Gambill, Harsco's president. &quot;We would have had togive the assets away.&quot; Instead, over the past two years, thecompany has taken $110 million in write-offs on its defensework and laid off more than 40% of the 3,000 employees at itsdefense unit.   Like many other small and medium-sized contractors, thekilling blow to Harsco's defense business may be the loss ofits suppliers. Thousands of subcontractors in almost everysegment of the defense field have already quit. &quot;Contractorsare now having trouble getting subcontractors,&quot; says DonFuqua, who heads the Aerospace Industries Association.   Despite its own cash crunch, Harsco has shelled outmillions over the years to keep alive one smallsubcontractor, Rogers Olympic Corp. Harsco says the partsmade by the Seattle metal-forming shop are crucial to itsproduction lines, but adds that it no longer can afford tohelp the family-run company. So, Rogers is folding.   Yet here and there among the smaller contractors are somebig winners. Companies such as Loral, E-Systems Inc.,California Microwave Inc. and many other specialtycontractors are nestled in niches that will do well no matterhow deeply Congress cuts defense outlays.   At Loral, these are boom times. &quot;Whatever the defensebudget is going to be in the 1990s, it's going to bedominated by electronics,&quot; Loral Chairman Bernard Schwartzasserts.   At the company's 40-year-old plant in the Bronx,surrounded by torn-up streets and shuttered auto-body shops,locally hired workers sit elbow-to-elbow assembling miniaturecircuits. The circuits will go into radar-warning devices --the &quot;black boxes&quot; intended to help Air Force pilots evademissiles. In contravention of conventional wisdom, theinner-city operation has been Loral's biggest money-maker.   Electronics gear accounts for nearly half the price tag ofeach new fighter rolling off an assembly line. But unlikeMcDonnell Douglas and other aircraft makers, Loral willprofit handsomely even if the next generation of planes nevergets off the drawing board. If the Pentagon keeps flying itsold planes, it still will need to update their electronicguts.   Other companies also are eyeing this multibillion-dollarcorner of the industry, which makes everything fromsubmarine-detection gear to reconnaissance drones tohigh-resolution radar. But Loral isn't fazed. While most ofits competitors are conservatively hoarding their cash, Loralhas been swallowing other companies. &quot;We're thinkingacquisition every day,&quot; Mr. Schwartz says.   So far, the strategy has worked. While an industry powersuch as Northrop faces the grim prospect of shrinking into alackluster subcontractor, Loral has nearly doubled its annualrevenue over the past four fiscal years, to $1.27 billion,and its operating income has steadily increased to more than$148 million.   &quot;We're becoming dominant in some parts of the industry,&quot;says Mr. Schwartz, who relishes his image as a maverickentrepreneur. &quot;It's safer than switching to the hairspraybusiness.&quot;   ---                     The Peace Penalty --         How the Top 10 Arms Makers Face the Future                 AMOUNT OF FISCAL 1989 COMPANY               PRIME CONTRACTS (Headquarters)          (In billions)  OUTLOOK                                                                                                        McDonnell Douglas Corp.         $8.62  Fighters, (St. Louis) helicopters,                                        missiles and c-17                                        all face major cuts.
