Redell.andM;&quot;The most serious risk is abuse by authorized users of the system, ratherthan penetration by outsiders,&quot; Redell said, and identifying users wouldprovide an audit trail of NCIC use.andM;But NCIC section chief David Nemecek said, &quot;A whole portion of NCIC 2000 willbe dedicated to an audit trail of the entire system.&quot;andM;The FBI also is reviewing the use of intelligent workstations to enhanceaccess security, said William Bayse, assistant director of the FBI'sTechnical Services Division.andP;  Special access controls through theseworkstations might include smart cards, automated distribution and periodicchange of passwords and fingerprint recognition entry, he said.andM;FBI engineers also have developed new ways to use computers to compare andmatch DNA samples, and they are looking to NCIC to create a DNA database.andO;The NCIC staff and the engineers will meet in late summer or fall to discusspossible ways to create the database, Bayse said.andM;But he FBI has no immediate plans to include the database in NCIC 2000,Nemecek said, because such a proposal must first be approved by the NCICAdvisory Policy Board and Congress.andM;&quot;Utilizing NCIC is a natural first thought for DNA,&quot; Nemecek said, because itwould provide a national network that law enforcement investigators could useto access the database.andM;The ACLU urged the subcommittee &quot;not to authorize any funding for awide-scale DNA database until the privacy and civil liberties issues posed bysuch a database can be studied further,&quot; Goldman said.andM;CPSR also opposed FBI plans to automate storage and matching of mugshots.andO;While fingerprint matching is a viable emerging technology, &quot;there is littleporspect that the superficially similar goal of reliable automative mugshotrecognition will be attained in the next 10 years,&quot; Redell said.andP;  &quot;There isthe danger that premature adoption of such technology would result in seriousproblems of false identification.&quot;andM;The FBI is moving ahead on these projects in tandem with NCIC 2000, Baysesaid.andM;A pilot project to match fingerprints and mugshots is under way in severalWestern states, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
