(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A little company on a steamy bayou, MarineShale Processors, raked in millions using what it said was arevolutionary process to turn toxic waste into glassy black rubbleit sold for construction projects.   Last year, it handled wastes from more than 2,500 companies in 48states.   Meanwhile, residents of St. Mary Parish accuse the company ofcancer-causing pollution. State environmental officials have leviedover $5 million in fines and last month halted sale of its black``aggregate.'' Sen. John Breaux, D-La., held hearings on MarineShale last year and two federal grand juries reportedly have studiedit.   This month, the company laid off nearly a fourth of its 400employees.   Competitors, who call the process a sham, say the end is near.   But Jack Kent, Marine Shale's fiery-tempered president, vows hewon't shut down without a long and costly fight. ``Anybody withhalf-way brains would know this is a much better process to handlethis material than any other method in the country today ... or inthe world today,'' he said.   ``As far as we're concerned, Marine Shale is on death row. It'sjust a matter of hooking up the juice,'' said Richard Fortuna of theHazardous Waste Treatment Council, a Washington-based lobbying groupfor Rollins Environmental Services and other waste handlers whoseprices were undercut.   Marine Shale began burning hazardous waste in its 275-foot longkiln in 1985, charging up to $300 per 55-gallon drum to take toxicmaterials from those who produce them. Kent says that's about halfwhat others charged. It sold its aggregate, as fill for roadbeds andboat slips, for $1 a ton.   ``MSP gross revenues for the first quarter 1989 are the highestever!'' boasts a flier in the office. Kent said that translates toroughly $22 million.   Profit ordinarily would run 15 percent, he said, but millions inlegal fees are making a healthy dent. And business has dropped off50 percent, he said, since the May 26 order banning sale of MarineShale aggregate.   The Hazardous Waste Treatment Council says the huge,computer-monitored kiln is nothing more than a glorifiedincinerator. Fortuna said Marine Shale skirted environmental laws bycalling itself a recycler instead of a disposer.   Marine Shale countered that it was operating under some of thenation's strictest air and water permits _ stricter than those for aRollins incinerator at Baton Rouge. Louisiana Department ofEnvironmental Quality officials backed that claim, though the agencyhas accused the company of frequently violating the permits and istrying to have them revoked.   The state has complained of sloppy storage, violation of airquality standards and refusal to move an allegedly dangerous storagebarge off Bayou Bouef alongside the plant. Marine Shale has compliedwith some DEQ orders and has appealed others, including one revokingits permits because it allegedly treated waste from a foreigncountry, Canada, in violation of state law.   Company vice president and general counsel George Eldredge hasrepeatedly accused DEQ of delaying administrative hearings onorders, some dating to 1986. Kent is eager to get DEQ hearings overwith so he can take matters to court. Miriam Price of St. MaryParish is just as eager as Kent, but for different reasons. ``I seea long road ahead for those of us who would like to see Marine Shaleclosed. And we're looking to DEQ to do the job.''   Mrs. Price claims a personal stake. Her granddaughter, NicolePrice, is one of six children afflicted with a rare form of cancer,malignant neuroblastoma.   The mother of one child who died from the disease has filed suitagainst Marine Shale, blaming it for the cancer. Mrs. Price pointsout that all six were diagnosed after the company began operations.   Nonetheless, she said, ``I cannot accuse them _ I have no proof.''   A Louisiana State University study of the neuroblastoma casesnotes that the cancer is usually thought to originate before birthand that three of the stricken children were born before MarineShale began operating.   In almost four years of study, the Environmental ProtectionAgency has yet to say whether Marine Shale has done anything wrongor if it should be allowed to keep operating. ``We really can't makeadditional comments on Marine Shale, because of the legalcomplexities of the case,'' said spokesman Roger Meacham.   More than a year ago, the EPA did say Marine Shale's aggregateposed no ``imminent or substantial endangerment to the public healthor environment.''   The state halted sales because of evidence that rain, especiallyacid rain, could cause lead and other metals to dissolve out of thematerial in higher amounts than the EPA allows, said DEQ attorneyElizabeth Megginson.   Megginson cited tests revealing lead levels of .55 parts permillion to 1.5 ppm vs. an EPA standard of .5 ppm. Eldredge, however,said standards that apply to Marine Shale's product allow up to 5ppm.   Kent said he would not immediately fight the DEQ order in court,but would hold up shipments of the aggregate and try to work out anagreement with state officials to test the product and ensure itssafety.   As Marine Shale's appeals drag on, its giant kiln, resembling anelongated cement mixer, continues to turn and aggregate continues totumble out.   Wastes poured into the kiln are heated to 2,000 degrees for 2{hours while vapors from the process run through two giant buildingslined with scores of filters and rise into the air through asmokestack 140 feet high.   What's left is a brownish-gray powder. If tests show toxicmaterials were eliminated, the process is over; the powder also canbe used in road-building, and has been used to soak up liquid waste.If toxic metals like lead or barium are found in the powder _ theydon't burn _ it is blown into furnaces, melted and cooled to formthe gem-like chunks Kent calls ``Black Gold.''   Meanwhile, Marine Shale continues negotiating with DEQ over thecomplicated issues surrounding its process. If that fails, Eldredgesaid, ``It won't be decided until it gets to the Louisiana SupremeCourt.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs June 26</NOTE></DOC>
