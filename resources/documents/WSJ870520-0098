Kuang Hsung J. Chuang, former president, and Theresa Shieh, former vice president of the bank, were charged with various fraud schemes in a 42-count indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Manhattan yesterday.    Among other things, the two were accused of defrauding customers who bought the bank's &quot;yellow certificates,&quot; so called because they were printed on yellow paper. The collapse of the bank in June 1985 almost caused a riot in the city's Chinatown section after bank officers disclosed they had treated the certificates as non-insured investments, rather than as deposits.    Last September, a federal judge ruled the $14.5 million in yellow certificates were entitled to full insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The bank's assets are being liquidated. The FDIC sold Golden Pacific National to Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp. in 1985.    The indictment charges that sales of the yellow certificates were kept off the bank's books, hidden from bank regulators, and used to generate a &quot;slush fund&quot; and to cover up failed loans.    The indictment also charges Mr. Chuang with conspiracy for having the bank make an unlawful $6,000 contribution to Sen. Alan Cranston's 1983 presidential campaign. U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said at a news conference that there wasn't any evidence of wrongdoing by Sen. Cranston or his staff.    If convicted of all counts, Mr. Chuang, 47 years old, faces as much as 235 years in prison and $1.9 million in fines; Ms. Shieh, 33, faces 220 years in jail and $2.1 million in fines.    In a statement released by his lawyers, Mr. Chuang denied the charges, saying they &quot;appeared to rest on the government's misunderstanding both of banking practices and of customs in the Chinese community.&quot; The lawyers said Mr. Chuang would &quot;vigorously defend himself at trial.&quot;    Ms. Shieh's attorney said that he concurred with the statement by Mr. Chuang's lawyers and that his client also would fight the charges.    Both defendants are scheduled to be arraigned on the charges next week. </TEXT></DOC>
