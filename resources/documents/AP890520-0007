The anarchic state isgoing from bad to worse, and law and discipline are being violated.   More and more students and other people were involved indemonstrations and many colleges and universities had come to astandstill. Traffic jams took place everywhere, the party andgovernment offices were affected and public security wasdeteriorating.   Some activities on the agenda of the Sino-Soviet summit thatattracted worldwide attention had to be cancelled, greatly damagingChina's international image and prestige.   Actually, a handful of persons are using the hunger strikers as``hostages'' to coerce and force the party and the government toyield to their political demands. In this regard, they have no iotaof humanism. The party and the government have on one hand takenevery possible measure to treat and rescue the fasting students. Onthe other hand, they have held several dialogues withrepresentatives of the fasting students and have earnestly promisedto continue to listen to their opinions in the future.   The situation in Beijing is still worsening, and has alreadyaffected many other cities in the country. In places, the number ofdemonstrators and protesters is increasing. In some places, therehave occurred many incidents in which people broke into local partyand government organs, along with beating, smashing, looting,burnings and other undermining activities that seriously violatedthe law.   All these have shown that this will lead to a nationwide turmoilif no quick action is taken to turn and stabilize the situation.The nation's reforms and opening to the outside world, and the fateand future of the People's Republic are facing serious threat.   The party and government have pointed out time and again thatthe students are kind-hearted and they do not want to createturmoil. Instead, these patriotic students hope to promotedemocracy and overcome corruption, and this is in line with thegoals the party and government have strived to achieve.   Now it has become more and more clear that the very few peoplewho attempt to create turmoil want to reach their political goals _negating the leadership of the Communist Party of China and thesocialist system and violating the democratic and legal channels.They spread rumors and smear and hurt party and government leaders.They concentrate their attack on Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who hasmade great contributions to China's opening to the outside world.... Their purpose is to overthrow the people's government electedby the National People's Congress and totally negate the people'sdemocratic dictatorship.   Under such circumstances we are forced to take resolute anddecisive measures to put an end to the turmoil.   I urgently appeal on behalf of the party Central Committee andthe State Council: to those students now on hunger strike inTiananmen Square to end the fasting immediately, leave the square,receive medical treatment and recover their health as soon aspossible _ to students and people in all walks of life toimmediately stop all demonstrations and give no more so-calledsupport to the fasting students in the interest of humanitarianism.Whatever the intent, further ``support'' will push the fastingstudents to desperation.   I now call on the whole party, the whole army and the wholenation to make concerted efforts and act immediately at all postsso as to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation.   Comrades, our party is a party in power and our government, apeople's government. To be responsible to our sacred motherland andto the entire Chinese people, we must adopt firm and resolutemeasures to end the turmoil swiftly, maintain the leadership of theparty as well as the socialist system.   We also hope the people in the capital will fully support thePeople's Liberation Army, police and armed police in their effortsto maintain order in the capital.</TEXT></DOC>
