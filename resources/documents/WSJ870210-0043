Two days earlier, agents at New York's Kennedy Airport had confiscated 69 boxes of medical equipment and computers, valued at $228,812. Columbus Instruments was sending the equipment, used in medical research, to a Moscow conference on biomedical technology. Agents thought they had caught the company trying to disguise computers, which they claimed were banned for export to the Soviet Union, as medical equipment and sell them behind the Iron Curtain. The most powerful of the computers in question is a clone of the IBM PC XT, which International Business Machines Corp. already sells directly to the Soviet Union.    Columbus Instruments was supposed to be the latest catch in the Customs Service's war against illegal high-tech exports, which was begun in 1981 under the code name &quot;Operation Exodus.&quot; But apparently the agents, who called themselves &quot;Tech Busters,&quot; stumbled into a bureaucratic thicket, creating confusion that is yet to be resolved nearly two years later.    The story, as reconstructed from correspondence among Columbus Instruments, various government agencies and several politicians who have taken an interest in the case, highlights the problems faced by exporters of high-technology products.    The company's travails show how &quot;American exporters are caught in a hopeless web of confusing and complex export-control regulations,&quot; says Rep. Donald L. Bonker (D., Wash.), chairman of the House Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade. &quot;Little wonder we have a staggering trade deficit.&quot;    None of this is much consolation to Mr. Czekajewski, 52, who remains the target of a grand jury investigation, although no charges have been filed. The assistant U.S. attorney handling the case wouldn't confirm or deny that such an investigation was taking place. But a Commerce Department official said the government's case hinges on a pending joint government-industrial review of export-control policy.    Columbus Instruments, started by Mr. Czekajewski in 1970, provides sophisticated laboratory machines that measure respiration of rats and other laboratory animals. Because the market is specialized, about half of the company's sales -- $1.7 million in 1986 -- go overseas, including occasional exports to Iron Curtain countries.    The systems sold by Columbus Instruments include personal computers. Under toughened U.S. export laws, computers that attain a certain operating speed, or processing data rate (PDR), require an export license. Obtaining such a license is easier said than done. A Congressional aide on a foreign trade subcommittee says that process can take several months of wrangling with the Commerce Department.    The package shipped to the Moscow medical show included five Apple IIe computers, one Rockwell-AIM-65 and one so-called Super Computer.    Mr. Czekajewski says he didn't seek an export license because he assumed medical units using personal computers weren't sophisticated enough to warrant the attention of the self-proclaimed &quot;Tech-Busters.&quot; He was wrong.    Ironically, he says, it was the Super Computer, an IBM clone manufactured in Korea and Japan by Gardena, Calif.-based Super Computer Inc., that created the most intractable problem.    Also concerning custom agents was Columbus Instruments' declaration that Finland was the final destination of the shipment, even though it was headed to Moscow. Mr. Czekajewski says it was his standard practice to list Finland as a final destination because it was his representative there who would be selling the equipment.    Ten days after the customs raid, Mr. Czekajewski says, agents returned to confiscate all of the company's export files for the past five years. A day after that raid, according to Commerce Department correspondence, the department told Customs agents to confiscate the equipment because all the computers in the shipment were restricted &quot;in order to protect national security interests.&quot;    That was when the case against Mr. Czekajewski began to unravel. After Mr. Czekajewski traveled to Washington, D.C., to plead his case, the Commerce Department in October 1985 changed its mind about all the computers except the Super Computer, saying they didn't need an export license after all. (Mr. Czekajewski says the equipment wasn't returned until May 1986, seven months after the ruling.)    Commerce commissioned a study by the National Bureau of Standards to help determine the status of the IBM clone. A Customs official, who asks that his name not be used, said the grand jury case against Columbus Instruments now rests on whether or not the study leads Commerce to deregulate the computer. Commerce promised its conclusion by last fall, but now says the &quot;case is still under review.&quot;    But, according to a December letter to Mr. Czekajewski from Dan Hoydysh, acting director of Commerce's Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, it found the PDR of the computer in question to be below the level requiring an export license. However, the letter added, Commerce won't deregulate the IBM clone pending a review by the Department of Defense and a government-industry advisory committee set up to deal with technology issues. Mr. Hoydysh wouldn't comment.    A Defense Department blessing may be a long time coming, says Robert Stephenson, a Commerce licensing officer, because Defense has decided to commission its own review of the IBM PC XT and its clones. Columbus Instruments shouldn't expect a favorable ruling, said Mr. Stephenson, because &quot;Defense doesn't want it to hit the streets that the PDR is below five&quot; lest other companies hold the government to that criterion.    Moreover, several computer experts say the PDR is meaningless. &quot;The formula has never been agreed on and consequently everybody has a different PDR,&quot; says Robert Morrison of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. &quot;We've come up with 20 PDRs for the same microprocessor.&quot; Jack J. Dongarra, a computer specialist at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois adds, &quot;The whole idea of doing this is very complex and misleading as well. A computer is too complex to reduce to any one number.&quot;    For now, Commerce continues to regulate the computer for &quot;national security&quot; reasons, leaving Columbus Instruments in a bureaucratic logjam involving four government agencies.    That is a lot of fuss, says Mr. Stephenson, over equipment that &quot;has nothing superior in it, nothing that poses any security threat to the United States.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
