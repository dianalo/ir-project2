The board of directors' action was expected by analysts, whonoted that Miller already assumed much of the leadership last yearwhen he was named president.   ``(Miller) basically has the future of the company on hisshoulders,'' said George Elling, an analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp;Co. ``Now we have to see whether his strategy ... to re-establishthe company can succeed. I think the jury is still out.''   Miller already has begun reorganizing the company to reverserecent losses, though he noted Wednesday that the current quarter'sloss probably will be larger than originally expected.   Also, while Miller last fall predicted the company could returnto profitability by the end of its fiscal year on June 30, he saidWednesday that the company expects ``losses for the balance of thefiscal year.''   ``Industry conditions remain extremely difficult,'' Miller saidin a statement, ``but we believe we have in place the programsnecessary to complete the turnaround.''   Wang's class B shares closed at $5.37{ Wednesday on the New YorkStock Exchange, down 50 cents. Miller's appointment and commentsabout losses were made shortly before the market closed.   Miller, a former General Electric Co. executive, becamepresident last August after Wang's son, Frederick Wang, was forcedfrom the job.   Wang posted a $424.3 million loss for the year that ended lastJune 30.   Wang became a leading computer company largely by making wordprocessors. But analysts say the Lowell-based company stumbled whenit failed to react quickly to the emergence of personal computersin the 1980s, which replaced much of the need for word processors.   Wang then shifted its strategy to mid-size minicomputers, butthat market has been slumping as the smaller desktop computers growmore powerful and are being connected in networks.   ``The company has been floundering the past few years to find astrategy,'' Elling said. The projected deepening losses thisquarter are not unexpected, he said, adding, ``The real issue iswhether they can turn it around, if ever.''   The Wang family expressed support for Miller's strategies.   ``We have complete confidence in Rick Miller and the long-termplan now being carried out to return Wang Laboratories toprofitability,'' Frederick Wang said in a statement, speaking onbehalf of his family.   The family effectively has control over the company, with thepower to elect three-quarters of the board of directors.   Part of Miller's strategy has been to trim the company's costsand reduce its debt through layoffs and selling assets. At the sametime, he has declared that the company will be more responsive tothe needs of customers _ one of its shortfalls, according toanalysts.   ``Although additional restructuring will occur, we have alreadymade significant progress,'' Miller said.   Miller said the company is on target to reduce its bank debt toless than $93 million, down from $575 million. The company also hasreduced operational expenses by over $300 million annually.   Wang now employs about 22,500 people, compared with 28,000 atthe end of the last fiscal year.   Miller will continue serving as the company's president. Theboard also elected Lorraine C. Wang, wife of the late chairman, tothe newly created position of honorary chairperson. Mrs. Wang was afounding director of the company.</TEXT></DOC>
