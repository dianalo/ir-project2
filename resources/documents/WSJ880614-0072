Connally has emerged from personal bankruptcy-law proceedings, and a trustee is expected to be named soon to finish the liquidation of his assets.    Mark Browning, a lawyer for Mr. Connally, said the trustee will have a year to sell the former Navy and Treasury secretary's remaining assets and use the proceeds to pay off an estimated $50 million in liabilities. A highly publicized auction of Mr. Connally's personal belongings raised $2.6 million in January.    Under the plan approved May 26, secured creditors are expected to be completely repaid, while lienholders are expected to receive most of what they're owed. Unsecured creditors, who represent about $33 million of Mr. Connally's debt, probably will receive 10 cents or less for every dollar owed, Mr. Browning said.    The largest creditor is the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp., as receiver for Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association, which claims it is owed $45 million borrowed by Mr. Connally's former real estate partnership. Mr. Browning said he estimates the debt at $20 million.    Under the bankruptcy plan, Mr. Connally was allowed to keep his home in Floresville, Texas, 200 acres around his home and $30,000 in personal property. He also can keep any wages earned since he sought bankruptcy-law protection last July 31. </TEXT></DOC>
