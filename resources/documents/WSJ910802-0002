In the last three weeks, the dollar has fallen 4.6% fromits highs against the mark and 1.1% against the yen,including yesterday's modest rally.</LP><TEXT>   But many economists and currency traders contend thatwhile the dollar's rise will be much less vigorous in theweeks ahead, it isn't over. The advance, they say, has simplybeen stalled by traders' fears that central banks will beatdown a resurgent dollar and concerns that the U.S. economicrecovery will be weaker than previously believed.   For the five months through mid-July, the U.S. currency'srise had seemed all but unstoppable. From its post World WarII low of 1.4425 marks in intraday trading on Feb. 11, thedollar soared nearly 28% to a high of 1.8410 marks and 9%against the yen before being driven back three weeks ago byvigorous intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkand numerous European central banks.   Late in New York trading yesterday, the U.S. currencystood at 1.7575 marks and 137.57 yen compared to 1.7440 marksand 137.40 yen late Wednesday. The British pound fell to$1.6740 from $1.6855 a day earlier.   In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 137.56yen, up from Tokyo's Thursday close of 137.20 yen. The U.S.currency was trading at 1.7567 marks, up from 1.7445 marks atThursday's close.   &quot;I don't think the upward trend for the dollar has beenbroken,&quot; says John R. Legat, London-based chief Europeanportfolio manager for G.T. Management PLC. But he and otherspredict the U.S. currency will trade around its currentlevels -- possibly even fall a little -- before rising laterthis year.   Currently, &quot;the market doesn't know what direction to go,&quot;says Donald Mumma, head of treasury operations at CreditSuisse in New York. &quot;The dollar isn't going to get muchweaker because there's a lot of support at current levels forit.&quot; At the same time, he adds: &quot;There's a fear of centralbank intervention that will prevent the dollar from gettingmuch higher.&quot;   The dollar's rise so far this year has been instrumentalin attracting foreign investment capital. If it remains nearcurrent levels and shows little sign of rising, that flowcould taper off. However, a mildly weaker dollar shouldn'tscare foreign investors into selling their U.S. holdings,analysts say.   Behind the dollar's surge earlier this year were traders'and money managers' perceptions that a rebounding U.S.economy would spell an end to lower U.S. interest rates.Meanwhile, expectations of slowing economic growth plusfalling interest rates abroad were weakening foreign --especially European -- currencies. Investors usually areattracted to currencies of countries where interest rates arerising, and repelled from those where interest rates aredropping.   The dollar was also buoyed by an improving U.S. tradepicture and problems in Germany, ranging from the high costsassociated with bailing out the former East Germany topolitical and economic turmoil in the Soviet Union andelsewhere in eastern Europe. Besides its geographic proximityto eastern Europe, Germany has longstanding trade andinvestment links to the region.   &quot;We had high expectations for the dollar and really badnews coming out of Germany. The dollar was the thing to buyand the Deutsche mark the thing to short,&quot; says Claus Wagner,chief trader for Citibank AG in Frankfurt.   But those perceptions began to evaporate three weeks ago.First, there was the sobering effect of the central bankdollar sales on July 12, which within hours drove thecurrency down about 3% against the mark. Since then, tradersalso have begun to worry about the strength of the U.S.recovery.   Traders also overwhelmingly expect the Bundesbank laterthis summer to raise official interest rates by at least onepercentage point to combat rising domestic inflation. InJuly, inflation in western Germany soared to 4.5%, itshighest level in nearly nine years. In addition, Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev's invitation to the economic summitand his seemingly strengthening domestic political staturecalmed earlier visions of Russians fleeing to western Europein search of food and peace.   Still, many traders are focusing on the course of the U.S.economy and interest rates. &quot;The market's feeling about thestrength of the U.S. economy has changed. The latest datawe've seen for July indicating a mild recovery combined withanemic U.S. money growth has again raised questions about thepossibility of the Fed easing,&quot; says Nicholas P. Sargen, aninternational economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.   &quot;If you have expectations and they don't come through,people are forced to take their profits and run,&quot; says Mr.Wagner of Citicorp.   Indeed, Mr. Sargen says that &quot;for the dollar to stageanother upside break, you've got to get people convinced thatthe recovery is here to stay.&quot; The U.S. currency roseyesterday on a decline in weekly claims for U.S. stateunemployment insurance and an increase in the July nationalpurchasing manager's index. Further indications of the healthof the U.S. economy should come today in the July employmentreport.   Still, even if those numbers indicate U.S. growth,analysts don't expect the dollar to take off. First, &quot;there'sgoing to be an interregnum period during which the dollartrades between 1.73 and 1.80 marks,&quot; predicts Mr. Sargen ofSalomon Brothers. Later this year, he sees the U.S. currencytesting 1.90 marks.   But until then, traders say that doubts about the U.S.economy, fears of more central bank intervention andexpectations of higher German interest rates will keep thedollar's moves narrowly confined.   Mr. Legat of G.T. Management points out that the dollar isstill undervalued and that the U.S. trade deficit shouldcontinue to decline while Germany's balloons. In addition, hepredicts that U.S. inflation will continue to recede whileGermany's remains near 4% before falling back next year.   What's more, says Mr. Sargen, the Soviets &quot;can't get morecalm than they are right now. The risks are that things couldflare up again in the Soviet Union.&quot;   Some analysts also worry that despite predictions of arecovery in eastern Germany, rising unemployment there couldlead to social unrest. In addition, the German budget deficitwill remain bloated by spending on the eastern region,expenditures that have contributed to Chancellor HelmutKohl's ruling Conservative Party losing several stateelections since unification last year.   Indeed, these and other factors have even given rise tosome dollar bulls. Economists at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. areadvising clients to modestly &quot;overweight&quot; their holdings ofdollar-bloc currencies, which include the U.S., Canadian,Australian and New Zealand dollars. The firm adds that&quot;later, perhaps in the early fall, we expect to recommend ashift to a more aggressively overweight exposure.&quot; Merrillsees the U.S. currency climbing 22% to 2.15 marks in the next12 months.   Not everyone is so optimistic.   &quot;By and large the dollar is vulnerable,&quot; says Kit Juckes,an international economist at S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. inLondon.&quot;It's going to bump around a lot, but we're stuckbetween 1.65 to 1.85 marks for the next six months.&quot;   Yet even Mr. Juckes admits that the dollar should resumeits climb next year. The currency's recent setbacks, he says,don't augur &quot;a new long term-cycle against the dollar.&quot;   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $363.20 an ounce, down 40 cents.Estimated volume was a light 1.3 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Friday, gold was trading at $362.25 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
