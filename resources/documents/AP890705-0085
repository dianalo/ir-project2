Bush learned of the sentencing shortly after North had received athree-year suspended prison term and a $150,000 fine for his role inthe Iran-Contra affair.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he informedBush about North's sentence at the end of a meeting in the OvalOffice.   ``He didn't have any comment,'' Fitzwater said.   Bush, who returned to the White House after a five-day stay athis vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, spent the day at theWhite House in meetings with aides. He also had his weekly luncheonwith Vice President Dan Quayle.   During the day, Bush made no appearances where reporters couldask him about North.   Fitzwater said the White House would not comment on thesentencing. ``We don't think it's appropriate,'' he said, notinglater that North had the right to appeal his conviction.   Pressed on why there was no comment, Fitzwater said, ``That'scoming from the president. ... I know his thoughts on this matter.   As for a presidential pardon for North, Fitzwater said, ``Wehaven't discussed a pardon. There's been no discussion. It hasn'tever been discussed.''</TEXT></DOC>
