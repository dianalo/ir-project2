Stopping in Moscow on her way home to Vilnius, KazimieraPrunskiene said leaders in the five countries she visitedacknowledged Lithuania's right to independence and backed talks toresolve its standoff with the Kremlin.   Asked about Lithuania's quest for diplomatic recognition, Mrs.Prunskiene said: ``This is de facto recognition. The fact that Icame to these countries, that several of them received me on a veryhigh governmental level, that these consultations occur, that'salready recognition that this is not just an internal affair of theSoviet Union.''   Mrs. Prunskiene's trip was part of a growing campaign by allthree Baltic republics to gain full independence. The presidents ofLatvia, Estonia and Lithuania met Saturday to re-establish a56-year-old political bloc and form a united front in their driveto secede from the Soviet Union.   In Vilnius, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said onSunday that the Baltic leaders also had appealed to SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush, asking both ``totake our problem into their hearts.''   Landsbergis declined to release the text of what he called ``adiplomatic communication,'' but said he and the presidents ofneighboring Latvia and Estonia also had asked Gorbachev to meetwith them.   The Baltic republics were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Unionin 1940. They have taken advantage of Gorbachev's reforms to wage acareful, parliamentary push for sovereignty that suddenly took asharp turn March 11, when Lithuania defied Moscow and declared itsindependence.   Moscow imposed a partial economic embargo on Lithuania andthreatened the other two republics. The sanctions have forced thelayoff of 12,000 people in Lithuania, according to official reports.   A tanker carrying 80,000 tons of petroleum was en route Sundayto the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda to relieve the gasoline shortagestemming from the blockade, Lithuanian television reported. The oilwas purchased with money from emigre Lithuanians, officials said.It was not clear whether Soviet authorities would allow the tankerto dock at Klaipeda.   Mrs. Prunskiene, traveling as a private citizen, met inWashington with Bush, and with leaders in Canada, France, Britainand West Germany.   Although she was warmly received, the West in general hasadopted a cautious attitude toward the situation in Lithuania,unwilling to cause more trouble for Gorbachev as he wrestles withdomestic reform.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater emphasized that Bush'sMay 3 meeting with Mrs. Prunskiene did not change the U.S. policyof not formally recognizing Lithuania as a separate country.   Mrs. Prunskiene said on Sunday she was heartened that Westernleaders were pushing negotiations between Lithuania and theKremlin. ``The fact that they see us, Lithuania and the SovietUnion, as partners in negotiations is a sign that we're alreadyseen as a state,'' she said.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President FrancoisMitterrand of France proposed in an April 26 letter that Lithuaniatemporarily suspend its independence and enter into talks withMoscow.   The two sides are interpreting the Kohl-Mitterrand letterdifferently but appear to be edging toward a compromise similar towhat it proposes.   Mrs. Prunskiene reiterated that Lithuania was prepared tosuspend new laws that concern Moscow as a condition for talks andsaid she expected the Kremlin to raise its economic blockade of therepublic of 3.7 million.</TEXT></DOC>
