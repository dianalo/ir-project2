I agree with her evaluation that there has been movement from the federal government, but this is not where the real answer lies. That answer is within the hands of the courts and the Domestic Relations offices that are empowered to enforce support orders against evasive fathers.    Too many Domestic Relations offices are run inefficiently, with too much red tape and machinery that is more often broken down than in operation. Sometimes it takes women months to even have their husbands found and brought in for attachment hearings. If the critics think that there are too many lenient judges in the criminal courts, they should spend more time in the support courts. Not many judges send fathers to jail for breach of support orders. Time and time again a clever father is given additional time to pay support. If he hires the right lawyer, he may be able to put off proper support payments indefinitely.    One of the more perplexing questions is why judges refuse to come down hard on men who have lied about their incomes, lied on their income-tax returns, and forged their wives' names on dividend checks, interest checks and other valuable documents. I have seen numerous situations in different states where defendant-fathers have defrauded the courts openly in hiding sums of money, created schemes to defer income with their employers, received compensation in unreported cash, stolen their wives' monies, turned in fake IRS returns to the courts, claimed unemployment when they were working -- all of which was unequivocally proved during trial, and yet the courts refused to even chastise these men.    In two cases the wife's lawyer was chastised by the trial judge for attempting to bring non-relevant issues into the support case. The issues dealt with the criminal conduct of diverting income by the husband to avoid child support. These are incredible examples where justice is truly blindfolded to the truth. Of course, there are courageous judges who will come down hard on the dirty tricks played by some men, but these judges are in the minority. Too many refuse to press the fathers but they do place a very heavy burden on the mothers to support the children.    Ann Schreiber did not go far enough when she said, &quot;A child needs and deserves to be supported by both parents, and government can play a vital role in achieving this goal.&quot; She should also add that the courts are responsible for enforcing the child-support laws in this country.
