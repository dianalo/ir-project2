E. Robert Jensen, president of Lathrop's Shooters Supply Inc. ofTucson, Ariz., said he's making the weapons only to ``recoup thelosses from what the government did to me'' when it banned importsjust as his shipments of already paid-for rifles came into port.   ``I chose to see if I couldn't find a way to get out of theprogram in 60 to 90 days,'' he said ``I want out of that market.''   Jensen had gotten permits from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobaccoand Firearms to import the guns before he bought them, but Customswouldn't let him take the weapons. Instead, he had to break themdown and leave behind the receiver, which is the trigger and firingmechanism.   Jensen hired a company to produce new receivers and assemble therifles. He says his version of the AK-47 is better than theimports: ``It was made to higher specifications than anything theChinese ever made.''   Last summer's ban on imports didn't cover domestic production ofassault-style weapons that had been barred from import, said JackKillorin, spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.   But Killorin called Jensen's action an example of why Congressshould pass President Bush's proposal to ban such manufactures. Thelegislation is pending before Congress.   The bureau permanently barred imports of 43 models offoreign-manufactured assault-style rifles in July 1989, saying theweapons didn't meet the ``sporting uses'' requirement for importedfirearms.   The weapons were equipped with military-type accoutrements suchas folding or collapsible stocks, pistol grips, threaded barrelsfor silencers, flash suppressors, bayonet lugs and large capacityammunition magazines.   The ban was prompted by the public outcry after the Jan. 17,1989, slayings of five children in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyardby a drifter wielding an AK-47.   ``This most recent action ... illustrates the industry'screativity when there's a loophole to be exploited and a dollar tobe made,'' said Josh Sugarmann, director of the Firearms PolicyProject who first noticed the AK-47s were being made by Jensen'scompany.   Killorin and Jensen said they knew of no other U.S. company thatwas manufacturing assault-style firearms banned from import.   ``I don't think anyone else is crazy enough to get involved inthis,'' said Jensen, who said he has been in the firearmsdistribution and retail business since 1955.   ``There's no money in the firearms manufacturing market,'' hesaid. ``If I can come out even it's going to be a victory.''   Jensen has sued the government in federal court over the importban, although the government has won similar legal battles.   ``We don't have any problem with the fact that BATF arbitrarilyand capriciously decided they weren't going to issue any morepermits,'' Jensen said. ``But I had issued permits on the basis ofwhich I purchased the firearms. They were legal, saleable privateproperty.''   He would not specify how many guns were involved, narrowing itonly to the ``mid-four figures.'' Nor would he say how many AK-47she's manufacturing with the salvaged parts.   The original price of the new guns to dealers was $498 each fornine or fewer, $449 each for 10 or more. But Jensen said he droppedboth prices about $50 to move the guns more quickly.   ``That's still a premium price,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
