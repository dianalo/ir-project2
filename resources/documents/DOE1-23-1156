Beforea cleanup of the area can be undertaken, it will be necessary to mapthe spatial distribution of the concentrations of the pollutants overthe area. Then boundaries can be determined for the regions that areabove and below action levels. The estimation of the spatial distributionsof the metal concentrations, with a prespecified level of precision,requires a definitive soil-sampling survey. The intensity of sampling(i.e., distance between sample points) needed to attain the prespecifiedlevel of precision will depend on the nonsampling error variance andthe spatial structure of the concentration measurements. To determinethe nonsampling error variance and the spatial structure, a preliminarysoil-sampling study is required. This paper discusses the planning ofsuch a preliminary study.</TEXT></DOC>
