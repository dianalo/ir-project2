Angular distributions were measuredfrom 10 to 40 degrees for an E/sub z/ range of up to 3.7 MeV. Severalnew spin assignments have been made by comparing angular distributionswith collective (vibrational) model DWBA calculations. An implicit foldingprocedure was used to derive isoscalar transition rates.</TEXT></DOC>
