President Maung Maung's government for the first timeacknowledged the two days of massive protests late Tuesday.State-run Radio Rangoon also reported the first shootings bysecurity forces since the rioting that toppled hard-line PresidentSein Lwin on Aug. 12.   The broadcast, monitored in Bangkok, said security forces inMoulmein, 44 miles southeast of Rangoon, fired on demonstrators whodrove four vehicles at them Monday night. It did not say if anyonewas injured.   The report said demonstrators also looted and destroyed acustoms warehouse there Tuesday morning, sank a motorboat and madeoff with the agents' weapons. Sunday night, protesters destroyed agovernment building in Sandoway, 90 miles northwest of Rangoon.   It also reported demonstrations in Rangoon, the northern city ofMandalay, and Meiktila south of Mandalay. It gave no crowdestimates, but Japan's Kyodo News Service said 200,000 demonstratedin Mandalay, Burma's second biggest city.   Radio Rangoon said about 100 doctors and nurses of RangoonGeneral Hospital, wearing their uniforms, joined the demonstratorsin the capital, marching along main streets and to the U.S.Embassy. Another group, including 50 attorneys from the RangoonLawyers' Council, marched separately.   ``These two groups joined forces in front of the U.S. Embassy onMerchant Street and gave speeches, and with those who came towitness as spectators, the crowd swelled to about 4,000,'' it said.   After leaving the embassy they marched through the streets and``the crowd swelled to over 10,000,'' it said.   ``During today's demonstration, there was no shooting at all bythe security forces and the crowd dispersed peacefully on theirown,'' it said.   Diplomats in Rangoon said up to 100,000 people led by studentsand about 100 saffron-robed monks marched through the capitalchanting anti-government slogans.   A Western diplomat said Chief Justice Tin Aung Hein convincedthe government to withdraw the troops to avoid clashes while thecommission investigates ``the wishes of the people.'' The juristbody was established when Maung Maung took power Friday, and is tocomplete its work by Sept. 30.   Soldiers had restricted the movement of the estimated 20,000protesters who gathered Monday outside the Rangoon hospital, arallying point. But with the troops gone Tuesday, the demonstratorssurged through downtown streets.   The diplomat also said a separate group of some 2,000 people satoutside the U.S. Embassy and shouted ``Down with socialism!'' and``Welcome democracy!'' He said they had picked the embassy ``topublicize their cause.''   An Asian diplomat, also speaking anonymously, said in a tour ofresidential areas he saw for the first time Tuesday the nationalflag hung upside down in an apparent protest.   Students have mounted demonstrations in Rangoon almost dailysince they spearheaded the Aug. 8-12 rioting that toppled Sein Lwinand, by official count, left 112 people dead in Rangoon.   Maung Maung, the Western-educated attorney general, is theformer British colony's first civilian leader since the 1962military coup replaced democracy with one-party rule.   The demonstrators are seeking the end of the exclusive rule ofthe Burma Socialist Program Party, a military-dominated autocracywhose rigid policies have turned one of Southeast Asia's richestnations into one of the world's poorest.   The new government has freed at least 600 people arrested duringthe rioting, including 100 on Tuesday. But several prominentfigures rounded up July 29-30 in Rangoon are still held. Theyinclude Aung Gyi, Burma's leading dissident, and Sein Win, theBurma correspondent of The Associated Press.   On Tuesday, AP President and General Manager Louis D. Boccardisent a telex to Maung Maung stating: ``It is our strongly felt hopethat one of the first acts of your new administration will be therelease of our correspondent.''   He said Sein Win, 66, has worked for AP for two decades andthere was no indication he was involved in anti-governmentactivities, as authorities have claimed.   Boccardi noted Sein Win's family has not been allowed to visithim, and AP has received no response to an earlier letter addressedto then-President Sein Lwin.   Burma has been in turmoil since September when students riotedover the voiding of 60 percent of the currency. Bloody rioting,increasingly focused on political demands, occurred in March andJune and, after a lull, resumed in late July after Sein Lwinsucceeded Ne Win.</TEXT></DOC>
