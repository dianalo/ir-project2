Its flop at aloss of some $5 million sent shivers down Shubert Alley, the heartof the Broadway theater district.   Was the Broadway musical on its last ``Legs''? It doesn't looklike that now. The 1989-90 Broadway season could be the best formusicals in years.   Eight musicals, including three revivals, are scheduled to openbefore Jan. 1 with several potential blockbusters, such as AndrewLloyd Webber's ``Aspects of Love'' and ``Annie 2,'' set to arrive inthe spring. It's the largest number in more than five years.   And the appearance of such stars as Dustin Hoffman in ``TheMerchant of Venice,'' Rex Harrison in ``The Circle'' by W. SomersetMaugham and Vanessa Redgrave in Tennessee Williams' ``OrpheusDescending'' undoubtedly will bring theatergoers to the box officefor plays, too.   The influx of new shows has created a booking jam for the moredesirable theaters. Many of them already are occupied withlong-running shows such as ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``LesMiserables'' and ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.'' Many hard-to-booktheaters have found tenants. For the first time in five years, theBelasco Theater, a gem-like but virtually ignored playhouse on West44th Street, has been booked for a commercial offering.   The fall season gets under way Sept. 14 at the Circle in theSquare with a revival of ``Sweeney Todd,'' the Stephen Sondheimmusical about the murderous barber of Fleet Street. Bob Gunton playsthe title role and Beth Fowler is his assistant who bakes thevictims into meat pies. The production is an adaptation of a highlyacclaimed version done last spring at the tiny York Theater Company,one of off-off-Broadway's more enterprising theater troupes.   ``Dangerous Games,'' two tango tales of passion and politics,arrives Oct. 19 at the Nederlander Theater. Directed andchoreographed by Graciela Daniele, the dance-theater piece has musicby Astor Piazzolla and lyrics by William Finn, who wrote ``March ofthe Falsettos.''   Director-choreographer Tommy Tune returns to the original VickiBaum novel rather than the 1932 MGM film for his musical version of``Grand Hotel.'' The show's music and lyrics are by Robert Wrightand George Forrest, the men responsible for such hits as ``Song ofNorway'' and ``Kismet.'' Set in Berlin in the late 1920s, themusical stars Liliane Montevecchi, Karen Akers, Michael Jeter, DavidCarroll and Jane Krakowski. It opens Oct. 29 at the Martin BeckTheater.   One day later, ``The Prince of Central Park'' premieres at theBelasco Theater. The musical stars Gloria DeHaven, in her firstBroadway appearance in nearly 35 years, as a woman who befriends a12-year-old runaway in Central Park.   Hollywood is the source of ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' a stageversion of the famous 1945 Judy Garland musical that produced suchhits as ``The Trolley Song,'' ``The Boy Next Door'' and ``HaveYourself a Very Merry Christmas.'' Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin haveaugmented their movie score with new songs. Donna Kane plays theGarland role and the other stars include George Hearn, CharlotteMoore and Milo O`Shea. The show opens Nov. 2 at the Gershwin Theater.   Rock star Sting will make his Broadway debut as Mack the Knife ina new adaptation of ``3 Penny Opera,'' opening Nov. 5 at theLunt-Fontanne Theater. The Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical will bedirected by John Dexter, who won a Tony for his direction of ``M.Butterfly.'' Also in the cast are Maureen McGovern, Georgia Brownand Alvin Epstein.   The 30th anniversary production of ``Gypsy,'' the story of howchild star Baby Louise became stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, opens Nov. 19at the St. James Theater after an extensive national tour. Tyne Dalyhas traded in her badge from ``Cagney andamp; Lacey'' to play Mama Rose,Gypsy's indomitable mother. The Jule Styne-Stephen Sondheim-ArthurLaurents musical also stars Crista Moore as the young stripper.   Composer Cy Coleman, who suffered the worst flop of his careerwith ``Welcome to the Club'' last season, tries again this year with``City of Angels,'' a 1940s detective musical set in Los Angeles.David Zippell wrote the lyrics and Larry Gelbart the book for theshow which premieres Dec. 7 at the Virginia Theater. It stars ReneAuberjonois, Gregg Edelman, Randy Graff and James Naughton.   Vanessa Redgrave starts the parade of big stars in plays with herarrival Sept. 24 in ``Orpheus Descending,'' the Williams play thatlater became the Marlon Brando movie ``The Fugitive Kind.''Co-starring with Miss Redgrave are Kevin Anderson, Tammy Grimes andAnne Twomey.   Larry Gelbart, one of the men behind ``M-A-S-H,'' tries his handat more contemporary politics with ``Mastergate,'' a comedy aboutthe Iran-Contra scandal. It opens Oct. 12 at the Criterion Center.
