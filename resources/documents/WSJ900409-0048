And I consider that tobe a selfish motive.}   -- Independent counsel prosecutor Dan Webb after theverdict.                                                                                                          What has been resolved by the Iran-Contra trials, what hasbeen established? Congress and the Democratic Party haveachieved a victory of sorts. A jury has declared that JohnPoindexter violated congressional law by not being frankenough in his dealings with Congress. Politics goes on,though, and it's a little ironic how far away politics hasmoved from the original substance of this dispute.   For example, is the Poindexter verdict a repudiation ofPresident Reagan's Nicaragua policy? Judge Greene's directivenotwithstanding, that of course is a political question. Onthe evidence, the policy is a success. Congressional policywas to stop the Contras from pressuring the Soviet-supportedSandinista government. Despite the five anti-Contra Bolandamendments, the White House did keep the Contras alive bodyand soul, and they made Sandinista consolidation impossible.When the Nicaraguans got to vote, they removed theSandinistas from power.   On the legal side, if the Iran-Contra convictions areupheld on appeal we will have some very curious precedents.President Reagan was forced to testify, but Judge Greenerefused to subpoena 65 congressmen. Mr. Poindexter's lawyerswanted to show that Members were not deceived because theyknew before Mr. Poindexter's testimony about aid to theContras and the missile shipment to Iran. In other words, wemay never know what congressmen knew and when they knew it.Those who say the Poindexter case shows that the Presidentisn't above the law profess no concern that Congress is farabove the law.   Treating criminal trials as an extension of partisanpolitics leaves the President's political status vis a visCongress pretty much where it was. Congress will keep tryingto commandeer presidential power by any means so long as thePresident fails to guard his office. One likely change isthat on advice of counsel, executive-branch officials willalmost certainly be less frank in their congressionaltestimony, lest in difficult matters they become the targetof a congressman's demand for a special prosecutor.   This congressional criminalizing of policy differenceswith the executive branch will probably only end when theDemocrats think they have some prospect of regaining thepresidency. They now pay no price for substituting litigationfor politics. They are happy for judges and juries to becomea proxy for the electorate -- except that in the Ollie Northand Poindexter trials the juror-voters had to convince thecourt that they knew nothing whatsoever about the politicallife of the country. The judiciary might ask itself if itreally wants to play the top role in this brutal politicalgame.   For the larger electorate, Iran-Contra will be rememberedfor the televised hearings which gave ample opportunity forthe public to form its opinion of the matter. For PresidentReagan and his treatment by history, Iran-Contra will likelybe a footnote against the fall of communism -- including inNicaragua.   President Bush now has the opportunity of the post-ColdWar era to find a modus vivendi with Congress that doesn'tdrive politics into courtrooms. He should seriously considera pardon for the Iran-Contra defendants, veto any morespecial prosecutor laws and tell Congress that foreign policywill again be set the old-fashioned way, by give and takebetween the two political branches of government.</TEXT></DOC>
