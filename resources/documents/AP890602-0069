The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries were kicking off their talks at an afternoonmeeting of an eight-member committee.   Their formal strategy sessions will begin Monday when they opentheir mid-year ministerial meeting at OPEC headquarters in Vienna.   The ministers' task is to set pricing and production levels forthe final half of the year.   Analysts predicted tough bargaining during the discussions.   ``They will come to an agreement in the end,'' said PierreTerzian, editor of the Paris-based oil publication,Petrostrategies. ``But it will be rather difficult.''   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, confirmed reportsthat he intended to suggest scrapping the cartel's benchmark priceof $18 a barrel. He declined to elaborate.   The Saudis were earlier reported to have wanted to revive aplan, unveiled briefly late last year, for setting a minimum priceof $15 a barrel.   The production accord that runs from January to June has set anoutput ceiling of 18.5 million barrels a day for the producernations. Its price target is $18 a barrel.   The agreement was worked out in November in an effort to curbOPEC's overproduction and lift crude prices.   Prices have surged this year, a gain attributed not only to thecartel's output cuts but also to accidents in oil-producing areas.The supply of oil has been reduced to the world market, althoughanalysts have reported a pickup in OPEC output in recent weeks.   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEChas soared from $12.34 a barrel in November to $17.67 a barrel lastweek. It ran up above the cartel's benchmark earlier in the yearbut has slipped a bit since then.   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude, wastrading at $20 a barrel.   Nick Antill, analyst at the London brokerage County NatWest,predicted producers would raise their daily output ceiling by amillion or so barrels, up to 19.5 million barrels.   OPEC reported last week that 12 of its members supplied 17.54million barrels a day in international markets in April, just abovethe supply target of 17.51 million barrels.
