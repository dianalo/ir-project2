Gorbachev said today that aconservative Soviet public afraid of change is holding back hisefforts at economic and political reform.   ``Changing people's minds is the most difficult thing.Perestroika depends on public opinion, and it's conservative,'' hesaid.   Gorbachev previously has blamed bureaucrats for bogging downperestroika, his program of restructuring Soviet society. This isthe first time he has said the people might be at fault.   ``In politics, the public doesn't accept pluralism, and it hascomplexes about ideological conceptions and cliches,'' Gorbachevtold a crowd of reporters in a break at the Russian congress.   Many hard-liners are unhappy with Gorbachev's recent moves toend the Communist Party's monopoly on power, legalize privateownership of factories and otherwise upset basic laws of Marxism.   ``In economics, they say you must not touch this and you mustnot touch that,'' Gorbachev said.   Turning to Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov, who gave a televisioninterview last week on economic reform proposals, Gorbachevcommented: ``Ryzhkov only said a few words and already there isgreat agitation in the country.''   ``Take any sphere, everywhere we are hindered by complexes,''the Soviet leader said.   Faced with public alarm, Gorbachev has repeatedly delayed aradical economic reform plan over the last two months.   He backed off suggestions by his aides that he was planningPolish-style ``shock therapy,'' which brought sudden price risesand mass unemployment in that country, in hope of shortening thedifficult period of transition from old-style Communism to a marketeconomy.   Instead, Gorbachev has promised the public that nothing would bedecided without discussion. He also indicated that his presentationof the program to the national parliament will be delayed again, ashe will not discuss it with his own Presidential Council ofadvisors until May 22.   Gorbachev also used the brief encounter with reporters toreassure the Soviet populace that the country can handle thecurrent intense political struggle and its economic crisis, whichhas left stores near empty.   ``People are saying `Chaos, chaos, collapse, collapse.' WhenLenin watched a similar revolutionary process, he said: `You know,this chaos will crystallize a new form of life.''   The Soviet leader was looking relaxed and healthy after a dayand a half of watching the Congress of the Russian republic wrangleover its agenda. Newly elected radicals are trying to elect aGorbachev rival, Boris Yeltsin, as president of Russia, and towrest control of the republic's affairs away from the nationalgovernment. Russia is the largest of 15 republics in the SovietUnion, with 52 percent of its people and three-quarters of its landmass.   Gorbachev, who stands to lose considerable prestige if hiscandidate, Russian premier Alexander Vlasov, is defeated byYeltsin, was off-hand when asked about the struggle.   ``I see no drama in this,'' he said. ``This is all normal. The(Communist) party has given up its monopoly.''   ``Tomorrow or the next day, new parties will appear with theirown platforms and proposals, and this will be a normal process.''   He also condemned the Soviet tradition of government-ownedmonopolies, which have been blamed for part of the nation'seconomic stagnation.   He even joked about it.   ``We fought against the capitalist monopoly for 70 years _ butthe strongest monopoly is our own,'' he said. ``Right here we havethe representative of our former monopoly, Uralmash,'' he said,gesturing at Ryzhkov. The premier previously served as director ofthe giant Uralmash factory, which makes earthmovers and otherheavy-duty equipment.   But when foreign correspondents pressed him on the crisis in theBaltics, where Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are all demandingindependence from the Soviet Union, he abruptly shut down theinterview.   Asked if he would meet with representatives of the Baltic, helooked the correspondent in the eye _ and then turned away, tellinghis guards, ``Let's move on.''   Another correspondent then asked if he would meet withLithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, who was en route toMoscow this afternoon with a compromise proposal to put toGorbachev. He said, ``I have received no such request,'' and movedaway.</TEXT></DOC>
