But it didn't turn out to be so safe after all. Therepetitive movements required can cause tendinitis, neck andback pain, carpal tunnel syndrome and eye strain.   Now some employers and software makers are trying toalleviate these problems, which have caused unions to seekmandatory breaks from computer usage. Newsday, for example,has banned internal use of electronic mail in an effort toreduce the number of daily keystrokes at the New Yorknewspaper.   Meanwhile, Visionary Software, Portland, Ore., is sellingLifeGuard, a $60 program that tells users to take a break. Itmonitors keystrokes and mouse clicks and suggests exercisesfor the wrists, arms and eyes. To prevent carpal tunnelsyndrome, a swelling of the tendon sheaths in the wrist,stretch fingers for a count of five; relax; clench fist;repeat five times.   Vision Aerobics, Red Bank, N.J., markets a program calledVision Aerobics. The $99 program is designed to strengthenthe eye muscles. Segments of the program involve eye movementand focusing at different distances. Richard Cheu, president,says a new clinical study finds its users improve readingcomprehension.   A few companies have bought the software for theiremployees. But some observers question the market. &quot;Wehaven't found a lot of big time excitement from customers,&quot;says Christian Banes, president of Ergonomics, Phoenix,Ariz., which sells equipment to make computers safer. &quot;Toplevel executives say, `I'm not going to pay you money inorder to have my work force not work.'&quot;                                                                                                          Learning a Language   With Fewer Rote Drills                                                                                                          TEACHING foreign languages with computers has offered fewadvances over textbooks and flashcards. Most programs justprovide drills and fill-in-the-blanks games.   But linguists are beginning to use different techniques tomake foreign literature accessible even to novices. Tutrix, aprogram developed by Rob Latousek, president of CentaurSystems, Madison, Wis., analyzes the first 34 lines ofVirgil's &quot;Aeneid.&quot; For each word, the student can get theirquestions answered about translation, syntax, declension andconjugation. Centaur licenses to schools for $95.   Transparent Language, a new Hollis, N.H., company, hasdeveloped a different method aimed at consumers, as well asat schools. Its programs include classic stories in theirnative languages that appear on the computer screen. Wheneverreaders get to a word they don't know, they move the computercursor to the word. A translation of the word, thesurrounding clause and the full sentence appear below.Footnotes describe the parts of speech and linguistic rules.   Michael Quinlan, president of Transparent Language, sayshe developed the idea when reading with his young son.Whenever his son came to a word he didn't know, he would say&quot;beep&quot; and Mr. Quinlan would read that word. That led him totry to computerize the process.   Transparent Language sells a $99 program with shortstories in French, Spanish, German and Latin. Additionalliterary works, such as the windmill chapter from &quot;DonQuixote&quot; and short stories by Flaubert, Maupassant and Kafka,cost $13 to $26.   A caveat: Teachers say such software may help people brushup on languages, but to learn the basics, especially forancient languages, they need to spend time in class learninggrammar.                                                                                                          Simple Cholesterol Tests   Move Closer to Home                                                                                                          THE FIRST home cholesterol tests are on the horizon as twosmall companies race to get Food and Drug Administrationclearance to sell disposable devices to consumers.   Clinimeter, a credit-card-sized film made by CrystalMedical, and Accumeter, a cassette-sized device made byChemTrak, measure cholesterol as accurately as the $5,000machines bought by some doctors. The FDA recently approvedeach for doctors' use.   Although they use different technologies, both can get acholesterol count from a drop or two of blood. Within 15minutes, cholesterol in the blood produces a line on thedevices that lets a physician read the cholesterol level aseasily as a thermometer.   John Schulte, president of Crystal Medical, Woburn, Mass.,says Clinimeter costs about $5 a test. Accumeter costs about$6.50, says Prithipal Singh, chief executive officer ofChemTrak, Sunnyvale, Calif. Neither requires a big capitalinvestment; the cost of tests on office machines iscomparable, including amortization.   Neither device measures LDL and HDL, &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot;cholesterol. But &quot;we're heading in that direction,&quot; Mr.Schulte says. Dr. Singh says he'll have such a device laterthis year.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          VIDEO eye-testing may supplant traditional eye charts andprojectors in optometrists' offices. Mentor Oandamp;O Inc.,Norwell, Mass., has brought out a remote-controlled screen toshow letters that costs $2,850, one-third less than itsearlier model. Because letters appear at random, viewerscan't memorize eye charts. . . . With software publishersfiling suits over pirate copies of software at companies,Greg Lewis Productions, Rochester, N.Y., has introduced PCAudit, a $195 program that PC managers can use to check whatprograms are installed on each computer at a company. Anindustry trade group, the Software Publishers Associationgives away SPAudit, a more limited program for the samepurpose.</TEXT></DOC>
