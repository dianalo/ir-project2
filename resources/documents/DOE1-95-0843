The type of power system disturbance(e.g., sag, surge, transient, etc.) are correlated with the field operationsand corrective actions by the utility and a customer with a &quot;sensitive&quot;computer system are made to mitigate the impact of power system disturbances.The methodology presented in the paper will provide utilities and theircustomers with basic field data which will enable them to identify thepossible origins of power system disturbances and undertake similar studiesdesigned to mitigate the impact of power system disturbances on their&quot;sensitive&quot; microelectronic systems.</TEXT></DOC>
