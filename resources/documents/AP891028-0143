The newspaper said the evidence was found in a computer list ofall luggage put aboard the flight when it originated in Frankfurt,West Germany, on Dec. 21. The Passengers and luggage later weretransferred to a Boeing 747 at Heathrow Airport in London.   All 259 people aboard the airplane and 11 residents ofLockerbie, Scotland, were killed when the plane exploded andcrashed.   The Sunday Times, citing British sources, said the baggage listshowed that one suitcase was transferred to Flight 103 from an AirMalta plane, flight KM180. That flight originated in Malta themorning of Dec. 21.   No passenger accompanied the bag onto the Pan Am flight, thenewspaper said.   Late Saturday night, the police press office in Lockerbie issuedthe following statement by John Orr, the Scottish detective headingthe investigation:   ``As part of the ongoing international investigation, officersfrom the inquiry team at Lockerbie have traveled to many differentcountries including Malta. Clearly, it would be imprudent for me tocomment on the significance of any of these inquiries while theinvestigation is still active.''   The Sunday Times quoted Louis Grech, chief executive of AirMalta, as confirming last week that Scottish police had intervieweda senior executive of the airline. The newspaper said 20 airportworkers also were interviewed.   No one has been charged in the bombing. Press reports have castsuspicion on several terrorist groups, including the Popular Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine-General Command of Ahmed Jibril.   The Scottish detectives who are heading the investigation havecontended for several months that the bomb was put aboard Flight103 in Frankfurt. They have said the bomb was packed into aradio-cassette player.   The Sunday Times, however, said the bomb was placed in acopper-colored suitcase.   It said forensic experts at the Ministry of Defense's RoyalArmament Research and Development Establishment believe thesuitcase contained clothing manufactured and purchased in Malta.   The Sunday Times said a pair of trousers in the suitcase wastraced to a shop in the Maltese tourist resort of Sliema. It saidpolice interviewed the shopkeeper, who recalled selling thetrousers and other items in the suitcase to a man he believed was aLibyan.</TEXT></DOC>
