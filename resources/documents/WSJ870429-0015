The moves came after the Bank of England unexpectedly cut its money-market dealing rates 1/2 point. Those are the rates at which the Bank of England enters the market.    Barclays PLC was the first to announce a base-rate cut from the 10% level set March 18. Other big British banks soon followed Barclays's lead. The Bank of England signaled a rate cut shortly after noon as the pound continued to advance on international currency markets. Upward pressure on the pound eased only temporarily, however.    Senior monetary officials said British authorities decided to engineer an interest-rate cut after they became convinced that investor support for sterling was genuine rather than speculative.    In recent weeks, the Bank of England has intervened substantially in currency markets to try to prevent the pound from rising strongly against the dollar and the mark. But the central bank's success has been limited. </TEXT></DOC>
