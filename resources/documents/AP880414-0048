Donn Starry told reporters.   Starry specialized in armor systems before he retired last yearas commander of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, where hewas responsible for helping develop tank warfare doctrine.   The new U.S. armor was unveiled last month by Army officials,who said it would be ``a significant enhancement'' of U.S.capabilities for the M-1A1 Abrams, the main U.S. battle tank. Astatement by the service said the new armor would ``allow theAbrams to meet the anticipated threat well into the 1990s.''   Speaking to a Senate Armed Services subcommittee Wednesday,Starry offered an extremely negative assessment of the U.S.-Sovietbalance in armor and anti-armor weapons.   None of the top U.S. anti-tank weapons is likely to work againstfront-line Soviet tanks because the Soviets have developedinnovative armor, Starry told the conventional forces subcommittee.   The Soviets have a roughly 3-1 advantage in tanks stationed inwestern Europe, but Pentagon officials have argued that many of theSoviet weapons are far older and thus likely to be less effectivethan Western tanks.   In addition, the Army and other NATO nations have stockpiledthousands of anti-tank missiles, such as the Dragon, several typesof TOWs and the Hellfire.   None of them would work, Starry said, because the Soviets havedeveloped reactive armor that uses both a ceramic cover and aseries of ``applique boxes.'' The latter, developed by the Israelisa decade ago, are specially designed boxes containing explosiveswhich blow up when hit by an incoming explosive. The explosion ofthe box dissipates and dilutes the force of the incoming weapon.   ``The unhappy fact is that tanks with reactive armor on top ofbuilt-in glass composite or ceramic laminate armor will quitelikely defeat the warheads of all deployed'' weapons used byWestern forces, he said.   Starry's views took some senators by surprise.   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, asked Starry, ``Are you includingHellfire?'' His reference was to the missile carried by the Apache,the Army's newest attack helicopter and a weapon that was designedspecifically to defeat Soviet tanks.   ``Yes,'' said Starry.   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, asked,``Are you saying that if we went to war, our bullets and missileswould bounce off Soviet tanks?''   ``That's correct,'' said Starry.   In 1985, Starry took part in a study by the Pentagon's DefenseScience Board, which concluded that the Soviets had an advantageover the United States in armor and in attacking armor. The studydescribed the situation as a matter of ``national urgency.''   The situation is worse now, he said. ``Today, it is my judgmentthat we have crossed the threshold; the situation is now a matterof considerable national urgency.''   Army officials told the subcommittee Wednesday they agreed withStarry's assessment of the DSB report in 1985 and the currentsituation.   ``The Army agreed with the DSB conclusions in 1985 and stillagrees with the conclusion that we are behind the Soviets. We needto regain the lead and maintain that advantage,'' said Lt. Gen.Donald S. Pihl, deputy to the assistant secretary of the Army forresearch and development.</TEXT></DOC>
