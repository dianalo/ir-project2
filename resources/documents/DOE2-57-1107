Male B6C3F1 mice wereexposed to 0, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 ppm ozone for 23 hr/day for 14 days.During exposures and/or for a period of 90 days after exposures, subgroupsof mice at each exposure level were given drinking water containing 30mM L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO) to lower in vivo levels of GSH.These BSO treatments reduced blood glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS)activity (regulatory enzyme for GSH biosynthesis) and lung nonproteinsulfhydryl (NPSH) levels in nonexposed animals by approximately half.In contrast, ozone exposures increased blood GCS activity and lung NPSHlevels in a concentration-dependent manner, with smaller increases inthe BSO-treated mice. Immediately after exposures, an ozone-related inflammatoryresponse was seen in lungs, but no histopathological signs of developingfibrosis were evident. Ninety days later, mice exposed to 1 ppm ozoneand not treated with BSO had modest evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. Miceexposed to 1 ppm ozone and treated with BSO during this post-exposureperiod (regardless of BSO treatment during exposures) showed histopathologicalevidence of exacerbated pulmonary fibrosis, compared to similarly exposedmice not treated with BSO postexposure. These results indicated thatinterference with the body's normal defense mechanisms against oxidantdamage, including suppression of GSH biosynthesis, exacerbates the subsequentdevelopment of pulmonary fibrosis.</TEXT></DOC>
