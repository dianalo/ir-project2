Officials at the jail where Ms. Bembenek and Dominic Gugliattowere being held granted permission for the marriage if they couldobtain a license.   But Thunder Bay City Clerk Harry Kirk said the couple would nothave enough time to get the marriage license before Gugliatto wasdeported this afternoon.   Either Ms. Bembenek, a former model, Milwaukee police officerand Playboy club waitress, or Gugliatto needed to apply in personfor the license and jail officials could not arrange for the moveon such short notice, Kirk said.   ``As far as we're concerned, there is no other option,'' Kirksaid.   The $50 marriage form takes about 15 minutes to complete withthe corresponding paperwork but Ms. Bembenek would need to provideoriginal court decrees proving her previous divorce, he said.   Ms. Bembenek, 32, was divorced from former Milwaukee policedetective Elfred Schultz shortly after she was convicted ofmurdering Schultz's former wife, Christine Schultz, in 1981.   She was serving a life prison sentence at a prison near Fond duLac, Wis., when she escaped last July and fled to Canada to start anew life with Gugliatto, 35, a suburban Milwaukee factory worker,authorities said.   The couple were recaptured last month after a visitor to ThunderBay, a Canadian tourist city just north of Duluth, Minn.,recognized them from a segment about their escaped aired on thetelevision show ``America's Most Wanted.''   Since their capture, the couple has fought deportation to theUnited States, where they face escape charges. Gugliatto wasordered deported this week while a decision for Ms. Bembenek ispending.   Once back in the United States, Gugliatto will face charges ofaiding and abetting Bembenek's escape.</TEXT></DOC>
