Industrial output grew 0.4% in June following a 0.6%increase in May. With the rise in production, the country'sfactories, utilities and mines used more of their capacity inJune: 83.5%, up from 83.3% in May.</LP><TEXT>   The modest growth in output was higher than many analystsexpected, but it still left economists disagreeing over thestate of U.S. industrial health.   The 2.1% leap in utility output, largely due to a surge inair conditioner use, was obviously temporary. And another bigfactor, a substantial increase in automobile production,probably won't continue either, several analysts predicted.Car companies have been fattening inventories in anticipationof contract talks with the United Auto Workers union, whichget under way today.   &quot;This is actually confirmation, if we needed any at thisjuncture, that the economy is running low and slow andprobably will continue to do so because the increases inindustrial production and capacity utilization are related tofactors that are temporary, not fundamental,&quot; said DavidLittmann, senior economist at Manufacturers National Bank ofDetroit.   But while auto and utility production accounted forthree-fourths of the total increase in output, according tothe Fed, a number of other categories also posted smallgains. Production of paper, chemicals, appliances, televisionsets, fuels, furniture and business equipment all rose.   &quot;I'm encouraged,&quot; said Stephen Roach, senior economist atMorgan Stanley in New York. &quot;I think these data do reflect agathering of momentum in the manufacturing sector. I thinkthat could be an important swing factor to an improved tonein the U.S. economy.&quot;   U.S. manufacturing, hurt by the Fed's efforts to fightinflation by keeping interest rates high, has been ailing formore than a year. Just a few weeks ago, the Labor Departmentreported that factory employment continued to decline inJune, the 14th month of the past 15 in which it has dropped.   But Mr. Roach said the decrease doesn't entirely reflectweakness. &quot;I think the job cuts are largely restructuringdriven by a manufacturing sector that wants to compete in theglobal economy.&quot; He cited recent strong productivity gains inmanufacturing as one reason behind continued improvement inoutput.   &quot;We're still looking at a manufacturing sector thatoverall is in transition to leaner, meaner stuff,&quot; Mr.Littmann said.   Recent government reports have suggested to some analyststhat the worst may be past for many manufacturing industries.Factory orders grew substantially in May. Exports continue toimprove, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.Moreover, the Fed last week eased its grip on credit for thefirst time since December, allowing a pivotal interest rateto fall slightly.   Still, most analysts expect continued improvement inmanufacturing to be gradual.
