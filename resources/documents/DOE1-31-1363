<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-31-1363 </DOCNO><TEXT>Interdiffusion has been studied between 1000 and 2000{sup 0}C. The concentrationdependence of the interdiffusion coefficients is small. With temperature,they show an anomalous behaviour characteristic of diffusion in b.c.c.metals and alloys. The high temperature activation energy (175 kJ/mol)is greater than the low temperature one near the {Beta} {yields} {alpha}transformation (120 kJ/mol). Diffusion coefficients at infinite dilutionand the influence of zirconium impurities are specified. No Kirkendalleffect was seen in these alloys.</TEXT></DOC>
