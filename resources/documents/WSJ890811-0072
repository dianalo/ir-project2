The outbreak of the fungus-produced poison in south Texas is of particular concern. Much of the region's recently harvested corn crop, one of the first to be harvested in the U.S., is used by many food companies for tortillas, snack food and popcorn.    Some grain elevators in the region have refused to buy between 30% and 60% of the corn brought to them in recent weeks by farmers because tests have detected unsafe levels of aflatoxin. At least one corn sample tested by government scientists showed 75 times the amount of aflatoxin considered safe for human consumption.    &quot;We have a very severe and critical situation,&quot; said Richard Whittington, Hidalgo County executive director of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which doles out crop price supports. &quot;This will bankrupt some farmers.&quot;    Earlier this week, state authorities embargoed 70,000 pounds of year-old corn because of aflatoxin contamination and regulators have picked up surveillance of corn millers that might ship product out of Texas.    Meanwhile, farmers in some counties of western Illinois and eastern Iowa are discovering a worse aflatoxin problem than earlier thought with the corn harvested during last year's rare outbreak. Between 20% and 50% of the farmers in some counties have found aflatoxin in their corn bins, according to crop scientists and government officials.    It was never clear earlier how widespread the problem was. Government surveys in Iowa and Illinois last fall found dangerous levels of aflatoxin in about one-third of the corn sampled, but the surveys were too small to be statistically valid. Some experts believe that the aflatoxin, as earlier feared, multiplied over the winter in poorly stored corn. Aflatoxin, which causes liver cancer in laboratory rats and is poisonous to humans, is excreted by a fungus that thrives in hot climates in Asia and Africa, and occasionally in the southern U.S. The outbreak in the Midwest last year was widely blamed on the worst drought in 50 years.    The continuing problem with aflatoxin is taxing the ability of U.S. regulators to keep corn safe for human consumption, an issue that has already prompted Congress to hold hearings and some states to adopt their own screening procedures.    Indeed, there is new evidence that aflatoxin-contaminated corn is seeping into the food chain, albeit at a slower rate than this spring, when spot-checking by state and federal inspectors discovered aflatoxin in unsafe levels in milk and milled corn, and in lesser amounts in cereal and popcorn.    Earlier this summer, federal investigators found a trace of aflatoxin in a sample of chips made from corn. While the amount wasn't dangerously high, it shows that the poison can slip through the screening procedures of grain handlers and food companies. One month ago, a northern Illinois dairy dumped milk after cows apparently ate tainted corn. It is impossible to know, however, whether this is happening in quantities that might present a public health hazard.    Aflatoxin is so potent that the FDA considers corn unsafe for human consumption if it contains more than 20 parts of aflatoxin per billion, an amount that is often difficult to detect reliably under the best of laboratory conditions.    Large companies that use Texas-grown corn to make snack foods, such as Borden Inc. and PepsiCo Inc.'s Frito-Lay Inc. unit, said they either aren't buying corn from south Texas this year, or haven't detected any aflatoxin.    There isn't any evidence yet that contaminated corn from south Texas has entered the food chain. The crop represents a tiny fraction of U.S. production, and it is too early for much of it to have been processed yet.    But Texas authorities are concerned that some grain elevators aren't equipped to stringently test the corn crop they are selling to small tortilla makers, which themselves aren't outfitted to test what is a staple among the Hispanic population.    Texas officials are also concerned that some contaminated corn might have been shipped into Mexico, which is also thought to have a problem with aflatoxin in corn grown on its side of the border. </TEXT></DOC>
