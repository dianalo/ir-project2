When the dust settled, Computer Associates stock closed down $2.375 a share at $17 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock was the second-largest loser on the Big Board in percentage terms.    The company triggered the sell-off with an announcement late Wednesday, after the stock market closed, of &quot;substantial uncertainty&quot; about Computer Associates' results for the quarter ending Sept. 30.    At issue is the company's pending acquisition of rival Cullinet Software Inc. Customers of Computer Associates' products have delayed purchases until the completion of the merger. Cullinet stock tumbled $1.125 yesterday to $8.25.    A Securities and Exchange Commission official said the SEC yesterday gave final approval for Computer Associates to submit its prospectus to Cullinet shareholders.    Computer Associates has been a topic of debate among analysts recently. Critics have argued that the company has sustained its growth only through acquisitions and is now so big that it can't buy companies fast enough to maintain that growth. They also say Computer Associates has managed its financial statements more aggressively than is prudent.    The stock has lately become a favorite among short sellers. They are betting the stock will fall and have borrowed shares to sell, expecting to replace them later with shares purchased at a lower price.    The short interest in the stock surged to 2.8 million shares as of July 14, up from only 401,000 a month earlier. The bears applauded Wednesday's news and the resulting stock price tumble as confirmation of their suspicions.    &quot;The company's going to let one shoe drop at a time,&quot; said one New York-based short seller. &quot;I'm not sure how many there are; but the company is in a lot of trouble. It's not the growth story some people think it is.&quot;    Added another short seller from the Southwest who hasn't covered his position yet because he believes the stock is worth about only $6 a share: &quot;The situation hasn't changed at the company. {The management} has just run out of accounting tricks.&quot;    Analyst Charles R. Taylor Jr. of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said he thinks the company will vindicate long-term investors. &quot;Computer Associates will be impacted in a very transitory way&quot; by the acquisition delay, Mr. Taylor said.    Brian Taylor, who trades the stock for Dean Witter Reynolds, said much of the selling came from investors who &quot;are tired of being ripped up every couple of months.&quot; But he said a lot of investors, including himself, bought the stock, figuring it was a bargain at the lower price. </TEXT></DOC>
