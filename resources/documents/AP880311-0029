ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Richard Nixon in a new book criticizes theAmerican military establishment for ``preparing for the big warthat will probably never be fought'' and ignoring the possibilityof smaller wars.   ``Moscow is most likely to seek to outflank Europe and Japanwith aggression in the Third World, where our nuclear power isuseless,'' he writes in ``1999: Victory Without War.'' ``If we failto develop the capability to parry Soviet thrusts in the ThirdWorld, we will find ourselves unable to compete with Moscow.''   Nixon's book, the sixth he has written since he resigned thepresidency in 1974, is to be published this spring by Simon andSchuster. Like the last four, it deals with foreign policy. Hisfirst post-White House book was his memoirs.   He writes that Moscow is outspending Washington 4-to-1 inproviding military aid to other countries and that America mustcontinue providing ``tons of weapons'' to its allies to head offthe Soviet challenge.   ``It is not philanthropy but expansionism that drives the SovietUnion to pump weapons into the Third World,'' Nixon says. ``Itsgoal in exporting arms is exporting communism. ... We must do atleast as much for our allies as the Soviets do for theirs.''   He adds: ``Americans instinctively cringe at the thought ofshipping off tons of weapons and military equipment to countriesaround the world; they do not want to think of themselves as armsmerchants. But military aid is often the best way to protect ourinterests and those of our friends and allies.''   The United States, Nixon says, ``must not fall into the trap ofthinking that a reduction in U.S.-Soviet tensions means the end ofthe conflict. If (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev stresses the need to solvehis internal problems, we should not be conned into thinking thatthe system has changed or that the threat has ended.''   Gorbachev, the current Soviet leader, Nixon says ``more than hispredecessors is a powerful reminder that we underestimate theSoviets at our peril.''   Washington ``lost its collective senses'' when Gorbachev appliedhis public relations talents last December at the superpowersummit, the former president writes, saying that Gorbachev ``is soconfident of his strengths that he is not afraid to talk about hisweaknesses.''   Nixon also makes these points:   _``In 1999, when we look back over the 20th Century, we willhave to face the fact that mankind's advances in military power andmaterial progress have dwarfed his progress in developing thepolitical skills and institutions to preserve peace and capitalizeon our technological advances. It will be our task in the 21stCentury to end the mismatch between our technological skill and ourwoefully lagging political skill.''   _The United States has a greater competitive edge in foreigneconomic assistance than in military aid. This country has spentmore than $134 billion in economic aid since World War II comparedwith less than $50 billion by the Soviet Union, yet has failed tocapitalize on the advantage.   _``If we are to compete, it must be on their side of the IronCourtain as well as ours. If we compete only on Moscow's terms,Soviet leaders will take what we give them and come back for more.''   _Although the United States holds good cards in ideologicalcompetition with the Soviets ``they have done a good job of sellinga poor case and we have done a poor job of selling a good case.''He writes of ``the pap that passes for programming on the Voice ofAmerica'' and of professional diplomats who ``reflexively treatdisputes as if they were simply great misunderstandings rather thanimsurmountable differences.''   _The War Powers Act, which limits a president's power to takemilitary action overseas without congressional approval and waspassed over Nixon's veto in 1973, is not only unconstitutional butunsound. ``Given the realities of the world, the United States willsometimes need to use force in actions short of all-out war andwill have to be able to act quickly and decisively. While 535 wouldbe commanders in chief (the number of representatives and senators)dissect the merits and demerits of the intervention, the presidentwill have to keep glancing over his shoulder to check the clockwhile fighting to defend American interests.''</TEXT></DOC>
