Thetemporary regulations reflect the addition to the Internal Revenue Codeof sections 148 and 149(d) by section 1301 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986(100 Stat. 2602), amendments made by sections 1013, 4005(d), and 5053(b)of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (Pub. L. No. 100-647),and the applicable effective date provisions of sections 1311-1314 of theTax Reform Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 2659). <ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions </ITAG>I. Scope and Effective Date of Restrictions on Arbitrage <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Section 148 in General </ITAG>Section 103(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides generallythat gross income does not include interest on any State or local bond.If a State or local bond is an arbitrage bond (within the meaning of section148), interest on the bond is not excluded from gross income under section103(a). See, section 103(b)(2). Section 148 was added to the Internal RevenueCode by section 1301 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (1986 Act) and amendedby the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (1988 Act).The Federal income tax exemption of interest on State and local bonds enablesState and local governments to borrow at lower interest rates than taxableissuers. This lower interest rate enables State and local governments tofinance their governmental activities at significantly less cost. The lowerinterest rate also provides the potential to benefit from tax arbitrageby investing proceeds of the bonds in taxable investments. The principalpurpose of section 148 is to eliminate significant arbitrage incentivesto issue more bonds, to issue bonds earlier, and to leave bonds outstandinglonger than necessary to carry out the governmental purpose of the tax-exemptissue. A secondary purpose of section 148 is to minimize the tax arbitragebenefit associated with investing proceeds of the bonds in taxable investments.Minimizing this tax benefit targets the tax benefits to the activitiesfor which the tax exemption is provided. The arbitrage restrictions applicable to State and local bonds formerlywere contained in section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (1954Code). Regulations under section 103(c) are contained in andSection;andSection;1.103-13, 1.103-14, 1.103-15, and 1.103-15AT. The 1986 Act revised the arbitrage restrictions applicable to State andlocal bonds in response to a growing tendency to maximize arbitrage profitsin connection with the issuance of such bonds. Bonds routinely were issuedin larger amounts and earlier than necessary to satisfy actual financingneeds. A large volume of so-called collapsible bonds were issued, the proceedsof which may never be used for a governmental purpose. A lack of accurateand detailed rules under prior law led to arbitrage abuses, particularlyin connection with advance refundings. Section 148 and section 149(d) (relatingto advance refundings) were enacted to prevent these and other abuses fromrecurring. The most significant changes made by the 1986 Act are the following: 1. Under section 148(a), a bond that is part of an issue is an arbitragebond if the issuer reasonably expects (at the time of issuance of the bond)to use any portion of the proceeds of the issue to acquire higher yieldinginvestments or to replace funds that were used to acquire such investmentsunless a specific exception applies. In addition, a bond is treated asan arbitrage bond if the issuer at any time intentionally uses any portionof the proceeds of the issue in such manner. 2. Under section 148(b), the arbitrage restrictions apply to any annuitycontract or investment-type property. In addition, under section 148(b)as amended by the 1988 Act, the arbitrage restrictions apply to tax-exemptbonds subject to the alternative minimum tax if acquired with proceedsof bonds issued after March 31, 1988 that are not subject to the alternativeminimum tax. 3. Under section 148(c), the initial temporary period  for proceeds tobe used to make loans is subject to special limits. In addition, undersection 149(f) as added by the 1988 Act, pooled financing bonds issuedafter October 21, 1988 are subject to additional restrictions, includinga requirement that 95 percent or more of the lendable proceeds are reasonablyexpected to be loaned within 3 years. 4. Under section 148(d)(1), the amount of proceeds of the issue that maybe invested in higher yielding investments as part of a reasonably requiredreserve or replacement fund generally is limited to 10 percent of the proceedsof the issue. 5. Under section 148(d)(2), the amount of proceeds from the sale of theissue that may be part of a reserve or replacement fund generally is limitedto 10 percent of the proceeds of the issue. 6. Under section 148(d)(3), the restrictions on investing in higher yieldingnonpurpose investments apply to all private activity bonds other than qualified501(c)(3) bonds. 7. Under section 148(e), the minor portion that may be invested in higheryielding investments is limited to the lesser of 5 percent of the proceedsof the issue and $100,000. 8. Under section 148(f), the requirement that issuers rebate arbitrageprofits on nonpurpose investments to the United States is extended to allbonds (other than qualified mortgage bonds and qualified veterans' mortgagebonds subject to the arbitrage rebate requirement of section 143(g)(3)).In addition, under section 148(f) as amended by the 1988 Act, qualifiedmortgage bonds issued after December 31, 1988 are subject to the arbitragerebate requirement of section 148(f) rather than section 143(g)(3). 9. Under section 148(h), the yield on the issue is determined on the basisof the issue price to the public. 10. Under section 149(d), advance refundings are subject to several additionalrestrictions relating to arbitrage. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Temporary Regulations Under Section 148 </ITAG>Section 1.148-0T describes the scope and effective date of section 148and the temporary regulations thereunder and includes a list of the subjectscovered by the regulations. Sections 1.148-1T through 1.148-8T provide rules relating to the arbitragerebate requirement of section 148(f). A substantial portion of these rulesare reserved and will be the subject of a future notice. Section 1.148-9T provides that some of the new rules apply for purposesof section 148 generally. Except to the extent changed by the 1986 or 1988Act or by andSection; 1.148-9T, issuers should rely on the rules containedin andSection;andSection; 1.103-13, 1.103-14, and 1.103-15 for purposes ofdetermining compliance with the requirements of section 148 (other thansection 148(f)). Section 1.150-1T provides definitions and special rules relating to thetax exempt bond requirements in general.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Effective Dates</ITAG>Section 148, as added by the 1986 Act, generally applies to bonds issuedafter August 15, 1986 (after August 31, 1986 if the bond is a governmentalbond described in section 1312(c)(2) of the 1986 Act). In addition, thearbitrage rebate requirement of section 148(f) applies to any bond issuedafter December 31, 1985 if the bond is not a governmental bond describedin section 1312(c)(2) of the 1986 Act (after 3 p.m. E.D.T., July 17, 1986if the bond is a governmental pool bond described in sections 1312(c)(2)and 1314(d)(3)).Sections 1.148-1T through 1.148-8T generally apply to any bond to whichthe arbitrage rebate requirement of section 148(f) applies. An exceptionis provided for issues retired on or before May 15, 1989, if the issuerin good faith determines and pays the final rebate (if any) no later thanthe later of May 15, 1989, and the date 60 days after the issue is retired.In the case of any issue to which the new rules apply, the final rebateis considered timely paid if paid no later than January 16, 1990. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service carefully consideredwhether the new rules should apply only to bonds issued after the dateof publication, and whether issuers should be allowed to apply the rulesin andSection; 1.103-15AT of the temporary regulations for purposes of determiningcompliance with the requirements of section 148(f) in the case of bondsissued before such date. The determination was made, however, that generaltransitional relief was not necessary or appropriate for bonds still outstandingafter the date of publication.Section 148(f) requires issuers to rebate earnings in excess of the yieldon the issue and any income earned on the excess as a condition of tax-exemption.The first rebate with respect to most of the bonds is not due until 1991or 1992, and many of the bonds will remain outstanding a long time thereafter.Section 148(f), by itself, provides no guidance as to how the rebate isto be computed. In the absence of guidance, issuers could not determinewhether they are complying with the requirements of section 148(f), andthe Internal Revenue Service could not effectively administer the requirements.Moreover, the rules in andSection; 1.103-15AT were developed to implementthe arbitrage rebate requirement of section l03(c)(6)(D) of the l954 Code,which applied only to certain industrial development bonds (IDBs). Thoserules were not intended to apply to other types of bonds and do not providethe necessary detail or special rules needed to accommodate other bonds.Furthermore, it is important to note that the rebate computation underandSection; 1.103-15AT can be very complicated, that the results under thoserules are often quite harsh, and that the results under the new rules areordinarily more favorable for issuers.Although general transitional relief was determined not to be necessaryor appropriate, several special transition rules have been provided toprotect issuers that reasonably may have relied on regulations promulgatedunder section 103(c) of the 1954 Code from any material adverse effectthat might otherwise arise from such reliance. These transition rules aredescribed below and generally apply to issues sold on or before May 15,1989 and issued on or before June 14, 1989. Public comments are invitedregarding any additional transitional rules that may be necessary or appropriate.Issuers of certain IDBs to which the arbitrage rebate requirement of section103(c)(6)(D) of the 1954 Code applies may elect to apply the new rulesfor purposes of determining compliance with the requirements of section103(c)(6)(D). Absent this election, the rules in andSection; 1.103-15AT willapply.Section 1.148-9T generally applies to any bond sold after May 15, 1989,or issued after June 14, 1989.II. Required Rebate to the United States<ITAG tagnum="81">A. In General</ITAG>Section 148(f) requires issuers of State and local bonds to rebate arbitrageprofits from investing in nonpurpose investments as a condition of taxexemption. This requirement is intended to minimize the tax arbitrage benefitassociated with investing proceeds of the bonds in taxable investments,and to provide the accuracy needed to prevent abuses that occurred underprior law from recurring.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Exceptions to Rebate Requirement</ITAG>Congress recognized the potential complexity and administrative burdensassociated with requiring arbitrage profits to be rebated and, accordingly,provided two exceptions to the requirement. One exception applies to governmentalbonds issued by small issuers with general taxing powers. Under this exception,the rebate does not apply to many small towns, cities, counties, and schooldistricts. The other exception provides a means by which any issuer canavoid the rebate requirement simply by issuing bonds no earlier than 6months before the proceeds are to be spent.The 6-month exception generally does not apply unless all the gross proceedsof the issue are spent for the governmental purpose of the issue no laterthan 6 months after the date of issue. The statute includes special rulesrelating to bona fide debt service funds, an additional 6-month periodfor certain bonds, and a safe harbor for tax and revenue anticipation bonds.Rules relating to the 6-month exception will be the subject of a futurenotice, but certain aspects of those rules can be described at this time.First, special rules are necessary to enable issuers that do not issuebonds earlier than 6 months before the proceeds are needed to finance expendituresto qualify for the 6-month exception. For example, some bonds may not bemarketable without a debt service reserve fund. The regulations will clarifythat the 6-month exception is available to issuers of these bonds. Onlythe earnings attributable to the reserve fund will be subject to rebateif the issue otherwise qualifies. The regulations also will clarify thatinvestment proceeds of an issue may be part of a bona fide debt servicefund for purposes of the 6-month exception (and for purposes of the specialrule that excludes amounts earned on certain such funds).Second, special safe harbors are being considered that would encouragemore issuers to rely on the 6-month exception. A special safe harbor mightapply, for example, if substantially all, but not all, of the gross proceedsof the issue were spent within 6 months, and the delay in spending allthe gross proceeds was due to unanticipated events over which the issuerhad no control.Public comments are invited regarding these and other special rules thatmay be necessary or appropriate to encourage greater reliance on the 6-monthexception.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Temporary Regulations in General </ITAG>A primary objective of the temporary regulations is to provide rules thatminimize administrative burdens associated with the rebate requirementfor those issues that remain subject to the requirement. The regulationsprovide specific guidance relating to the computation of the rebatablearbitrage, the yield on the issue, and other related matters. The temporary regulations are lengthy because specific guidance is providedfor many types of issues. Only a portion of the rules apply to a particularissue, and most of the more complicated rules apply only to noncustomaryor more sophisticated transactions. The rules that apply to the large majorityof issues are not difficult to understand or apply. Moreover, the specificityof the rules should significantly reduce administrative burdens by eliminatinguncertainty and by facilitating the development of computer programs thatcan be used to determine the rebatable arbitrage without difficulty. The basic method for computing the rebatable arbitrage involves futurevaluing the nonpurpose investment cash flows at an interest rate equalto the yield on the issue. As explained below, this method is accurateand very simple. For example, an issuer that invests all the bond proceedsin a widely held mutual fund can compute the rebatable arbitrage simplyby future valuing the initial amount invested and the amount of each mutualfund share redemption that is spent for the governmental purpose of theissue. States may organize similar funds to enhance investment opportunities oftheir local governments and reduce compliance costs through economies ofscale. The regulations do not yet provide specific rules as to the treatmentof these funds. However, it is anticipated that in appropriate cases theState and local governments investing in the funds will be treated in thesame manner as if they had invested in shares of a widely held fund. Forexample, amounts earned by the fund and used to pay reasonable costs incurredby the fund to purchase and account for the investments will not be treatedas earnings of the fund investors. Only the dividends actually paid bythe fund to the investors will be taken into account for purposes of computingthe rebatable arbitrage. Most of the rules for allocating proceeds of an issue to investments andexpenditures are reserved. These rules will accommodate customary governmentalaccounting practices to the extent possible. For example, a general purposegovernmental unit may normally commingle bond proceeds and other fundsfor investment purposes and allocate earnings to each source of funds onan arm's length basis (<T3>i.e., </T3>in a manner similar to that of a widely held mutual fund).The regulations will provide that this method of accounting for the bondproceeds may be used for purposes of determining the rebatable arbitrage.In many cases, the allocation of the investment earnings may be reasonablyaccurate but not fully arm's length (<T3>e.g., </T3>the investment fund may not be revalued or investment earningsmay not be credited to each source of funds on a regular and accurate basis).It is anticipated that the regulations generally will not require issuersto change their normal accounting practices for purposes of determiningthe rebatable arbitrage. Simplified accounting rules, however, will notapply to any fund formed or availed of to distort the rebatable arbitrage(or to proceeds of bonds issued to advance refund another bond). The rules for computing the yield on the issue are much more detailed thanunder prior law. The yield on the issue for arbitrage yield restrictionpurposes generally is determined on the basis of the issuer's reasonableexpectations as of the date of issue regarding the actual yield on theissue. Prior to the 1986 Act, arbitrage yield restrictions typically appliedonly to advance refundings. Since these bonds pay interest at fixed interestrates, the use of the reasonably expected yield provided a workable (albeitan imperfect) standard. The scope of the arbitrage rebate requirement ismuch broader. The rebate affects every type of issue and applies to allthe gross proceeds. Much more detailed and accurate rules are necessary.Separate rules are provided for computing the yield on variable yield andfixed yield issues. A variable yield issue includes bonds the interestrates on which are determined by reference to future market rates. Forpurposes of computing  the rebatable arbitrage, the yield on a variableyield issue changes each 5-year period during the term of the issue (ormore often, if the issuer elects). Computing the yield separately for eachfive years is simpler, fairer, and more accurate than computing the yieldon a cumulative basis at the end of each five years. Under this method,the rebatable arbitrage reflects the amount earned on each investment inexcess of the interest cost on the issue during the 5-year period the investmentis held. Since the interest rates on the issue and the investments areproperly matched, the rebatable arbitrage from investing during a 5-yearperiod will not change after the 5-year period because of subsequent changesin interest rates.  A transition rule allows issuers of variable yield issues sold on or beforeMay 15, 1989, and issued on or before June 14, 1989, to elect to computethe yield over the term of the issue. A fixed yield issue is an issue of bonds the interest rates on which arefixed and determinable as of the date of issue. The actual yield on a fixedyield issue may depend on whether bonds are retired early if the issueincludes bonds with different interest rates. Interest on such an issueoften will accrue at a rate that is lower in the earlier years and at arate that is higher in the later years. These temporary regulations allowissuers to initially assume, for purposes of making installment payments,that the higher rates will be paid. The computation of the actual yieldon the issue and the rebatable arbitrage, however, eventually take intoaccount any early retirements. In most cases, the difference between theactual yield, determined with regard to early retirements, and the expectedyield, determined without regard to such retirements, will be very small.Computation of the actual yield generally is not difficult. In the caseof smaller issues, however, the administrative burdens are comparativelylarger and the importance of using the actual yield much less. A specialrule, therefore, provides that the yield for certain small issues is theexpected yield as of the date of issue (determined without regard to earlyretirements) unless the issuer elects to use the actual yield. Public commentsare invited regarding other special rules that may be necessary or appropriateto minimize administrative burdens. A transition rule generally allows issuers of fixed yield issues sold onor before May 15, 1989 and issued on or before June 14, 1989 to computethe rebatable arbitrage by using the expected yield on the issue as ofthe date of issue (determined without regard to early retirements) unlessthe issuer elects to use the actual yield.III. Rebate Requirement in General <ITAG tagnum="81">A. General Rule </ITAG>Section 1.148-1T provides generally that a bond is treated as an arbitragebond if the bond is issued as part of an issue that does not meet the rebaterequirement. An issue generally meets the rebate requirement if the issuer pays to theUnited States: (1) At least 90 percent of the rebatable arbitrage as ofeach installment computation date (rebate installments); and (2) all therebatable arbitrage as of the final computation date and any income attributableto such rebatable arbitrage (final rebate). Since a refunding issue continues or replaces the refunded issue, a refundingissue meets the rebate requirement only if each tax-exempt refunded issuealso meets any applicable rebate requirement. A tax-exempt issue includesany issue that (when issued) purported to be a tax-exempt issue. A refundingissue includes the nonrefunding portion of the refunding issue, and a refundedissue includes the nonrefunded portion of the refunded issue. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Computation and Payment Dates </ITAG>The rebatable arbitrage is computed as of each installment computationdate and as of the final computation date. The first installment computationdate is the last day of the fifth bond year. The issuer may select as thelast day of each bond year any calendar day that is the last day of a compoundinginterval used in computing the yield on the issue. Each succeeding installmentcomputation date ends 5 years after the preceding installment computationdate. The final computation date is the date the last bond is discharged.The issuer need not actually compute the rebatable arbitrage as of a computationdate if there is none. Rebate installments are due 60 days after each installment computationdate. The final rebate is due on the latest of: (1) the date 60 days afterthe final computation date; (2) the date 8 months after the date of issue;(3) the earlier of the date the issuer no longer reasonably expects the6-month temporary investment exception to apply, and the date 14 monthsafter the date of issue; and (4) January 16, 1990. Special rules for aseries of issues are reserved. C. Income Included in Final Rebate The final rebate includes income attributable to the rebatable arbitrageduring the final payment period. The final payment period begins on thefinal computation date and ends 15 days before the final rebate is paid.An issuer may identify the funds that are to be used to pay the final rebateand rebate income on the basis of the amount actually earned. Otherwise,the income is determined on the basis of the amount that would have beenearned if the rebatable arbitrage had been invested at the maximum interestrate in effect on the final computation date for a time deposit securityof the State and Local Government Series (SLG) with a term equal to thefinal payment period. This rate is one-eighth percent less than the UnitedStates Treasury borrowing rate for a security with a comparable maturity.If the final rebate is paid no later than January 16, 1990, the applicablerate will not exceed the average of the maximum interest rates in effecton the first business day of each month during the final payment periodfor a SLG with a term of 60 days. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. De Minimis Rules </ITAG>There are three<T3> de minimis</T3> rules. First, the amount of each rebate installmentand the final rebate may be rounded down to the nearest multiple of $100.Any amount less than $100 is rounded to zero. Second, no income is included in the final rebate if the income is lessthan $300, and the final rebate is paid no later than 60 days after thefinal computation date. In addition, if the final rebate is paid no laterthan January 16, 1990, no income is included if the income is less than$1,000. Third, as described below, the rebatable arbitrage is reduced by a computationdate credit. The maximum credit on each computation date is $1,000.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Certain Failures Not To Result in Loss of Tax Exemption </ITAG>Issuers may correct innocent failures (without penalty) if the failureis corrected no later than 60 days after the failure is discovered (180days if the correction amount is less than $50,000). The Commissioner mayextend the time to correct an innocent failure if the correction amountis less than $50,000, or if the issuer requests an extension before theexpiration of such time. A failure is corrected by paying the correction amount. This is the amountnot paid when required, together with interest for the period of delayat the maximum interest rate for a SLG with a term equal to such period.In the case of a failure to pay a rebate installment, the interest is computedat a rate no less than the yield on the issue. If the correction amount is $50,000 or more, a failure is not treated asinnocent unless the issuer submits with the correction amount a brief explanationof the failure and basis for concluding that it is innocent. The failureis treated as innocent if the brief description is reasonably accurate(or not required) unless the issuer is notified otherwise within 90 days.It is anticipated that the vast majority of errors can be corrected underthis rule. Issuers may obtain relief from other failures by submitting a request tothe Commissioner. Relief is available if the Commissioner determines thatthe failure is not due to willful neglect, and the issuer pays the correctionamount and a penalty. The Commissioner may waive all or any portion ofthe penalty. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Recovery of Overpayments </ITAG>Rebate payments are not refundable. However, it is anticipated that theregulations will provide that issuers generally may recover overpaymentsif the issuer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that:(1) The issuer paid an amount in excess of the rebatable arbitrage determinedas of the day before the date of payment (and in certain cases as of thecomputation date immediately preceding such date); (2) the excess was paidas the result of a mistake (<T3>e.g., </T3>a mathematical error); and (3) recovery of the overpaymenton the date the recovery was first requested would result in no rebatablearbitrage as of such date. IV. Computation of Rebatable Arbitrage <ITAG tagnum="81">A. In General </ITAG>Section 148(f) provides generally that the rebatable arbitrage is the sumof: (1) The excess of (i) the amount earned on nonpurpose investments (otherthan investments that are attributable to the excess described in thisclause (1)), over (ii) the amount that would have been earned on such investmentsif the yield on such investments was equal to the yield on the issue; and(2) any income attributable to the excess described in clause (1).The temporary regulations provide a simple and accurate method for computingthis sum that does not rely on more complicated and less accurate federalincome tax accounting principles. This method involves future valuing thenonpurpose investment cash flows at an interest rate equal to the yieldon the issue. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Future Value Method </ITAG>Section 1.148-2T provides generally that the rebatable arbitrage as ofa computation date is the excess of: (1) The future value of the nonpurposereceipts (the amounts received from investing in nonpurpose investments);over (2) the future value of the nonpurpose payments (the amounts paidto purchase nonpurpose investments). All future values are computed asof the computation date and by using an interest rate equal to the yieldon the issue. Computation of the rebatable arbitrage under the future value method isvery simple, because the computation focuses exclusively on cash flows.Investments attributable to an excess do not have to be separately accountedfor to compute the income earned from reinvesting the excess. The amountactually earned is automatically taken into account if the excess is reinvested.If the excess is spent, the issuer's tax-exempt borrowing rate is usedas the excess earnings rate. An issuer with a negative excess benefitsfrom the full time value of the negative excess if a positive excess arisesin a later year. The focus on cash flows also eliminates the need to make separate computationswith respect to nonpurpose investments that are not held on a computationdate. In many cases, the issuer can compute the rebatable arbitrage simplyby keeping track of the initial amount that is invested and each amountthat is spent. To illustrate, assume a $100 issue with a 10 percent annual yield. On thedate of issue, the $100 is invested in a zero coupon investment that maturesat the end of Year 4. The amount the issuer would receive at the end ofYear 4 if the $100 was invested at the bond yield is the future value of$100 at the end of Year 4, determined by using an interest rate equal to10 percent ($146.41). <T3>Example (1). </T3>Assume the issuer actually receives $156.41 whenthe investment matures at the end of Year 4 (a $10 excess) and reinveststhe entire amount (the $10 excess and the $146.41 nonexcess) in a 1-yearzero coupon investment with a 10 percent yield, which matures at the endof Year 5. The issuer receives $172.05 at the end of Year 5 ($156.41 plus$156.41andmultiply;10%). Since the $146.41 nonexcess is invested at the bondyield, no new positive or negative excess arises from this reinvestment.The amount earned at the end of Year 5 from reinvesting the $10 excessis $1 ($10andmultiply;10%). The rebatable arbitrage at the end of Year 5is $11 (the sum of the $10 excess and $1 earned from reinvesting the $10excess).

The receipt at the end of Year 4 is the amount that was spent.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Nonpurpose Payments and Receipts </ITAG>If a nonpurpose investment is purchased with gross proceeds, the amountpaid to purchase the investment is the nonpurpose payment. A nonpurposereceipt includes any amount received from investing in nonpurpose investments(including amounts received from the sale of investments). Gain or loss,therefore, is taken into account in computing the rebatable arbitrage.In addition to these actual amounts, the following amounts are treatedas nonpurpose payments and receipts: 1. <T3>Constructive payments and receipts. </T3>If a nonpurpose investmentis not actually purchased with gross proceeds, the investment is treatedas if purchased for fair market value when it is allocated to gross proceeds(<T3>e.g., </T3>investments purchased before the date of issue and contributedto a debt service reserve fund are treated as if purchased for fair marketvalue on the date of issue). Similarly, if a nonpurpose investment ceasesto be a nonpurpose investment but is not actually sold, the investmentis treated as if sold for fair market value (<T3>e.g., </T3>all nonpurpose investments are treated as if sold for fairmarket value on the final computation date). Under these rules, market gain or loss for the period during which an investmentis allocated to an issue is the same whether or not the investment is purchased(or sold) at the time it is (or ceases to be) allocated to the issue. lnaddition, the yield on each investment is based on market interest ratesin effect at the time the investment is allocated to the issue whetheror not the investment is actually purchased at that time. Fair market value generally is the price at which a willing buyer wouldpurchase the investment from a willing seller. Specific rules are providedfor determining the fair market value of investments traded in an establishedsecurities market. Special rules are provided for valuing SLGs that arenot in a restricted escrow and certain investment contracts. 2. <T3>Installment date receipt. </T3>For purposes of computing the rebatablearbitrage as of an installment computation date, the fair market valueof any nonpurpose investments held on that date is treated as a nonpurposereceipt. Fair market value is generally easy to determine, and the useof fair market value allows net unrealized losses to be counted. In the case of fixed rate investments, the issuer has the option on anyinstallment computation date to value the investments at present value.Valuing the investments at present value eliminates net unrealized gainsfrom the installment date computation. The present value generally is thepresent value of the future receipts to be paid on the investment, discountedat the yield on the investment. If the investment is purchased at par,the par amount plus accrued interest can be used (instead of the par amountplus the present value of such interest). 3. <T3>Rebate payment. </T3>Payments of rebatable arbitrage to the UnitedStates no later than the date due are treated as nonpurpose payments. Thesepayments, therefore, reduce the rebatable arbitrage. Any amount not paidon or before the date due is treated as a nonpurpose payment as of thedue date. The failure to timely pay is corrected by paying the correctionamount as described above. 4. <T3>Computation date credit. </T3>A computation date credit generally istaken into account as a nonpurpose payment on each computation date. Thecredit on each computation date is $1,000 if the outstanding amount ofbonds is more than $5 million, $625 if the outstanding amount of bondsis more than $1 million but not more than $5 million, and $250 if the outstandingamount of bonds is $1 million or less. No credit is allowed on a computationdate if the computation period is less than one year, or if less than 75percent of the net sale proceeds have been spent for a governmental purposeby that date. In the case of a refunding issue, the net sale proceeds requirement isapplied separately to each refunding portion and to the nonrefunding portionof the issue. In the case of each refunding portion, the requirement isapplied by reference to the use of the sale proceeds of the refunded issue(or in the case of a series of refundings, by reference to the use of thesale proceeds of the original issue). Thus, refunding issues (includingadvance refundings) are eligible for the credit if all the refunded issueswere eligible for the credit (and any new money portion of the refundingissue also qualifies). In addition, a refunding issue can qualify for thecredit on a computation date (even if the refunded issue was not eligible)if the 75 percent expenditure requirement is later met. 5. <T3>Imputed receipt. </T3>Imputed receipts are treated as nonpurpose receipts.Section 1.148-5T will contain rules relating to the transactions that giverise to such receipts and the method of determining the amount thereof.Receipts generally will be imputed to obligations that do not bear interestat an arm's length interest rate. Section 1.148-5T provides two exceptionsthat apply to investments of gross proceeds in demand accounts that areused to hold funds for a short period of time until the funds can be investedat an arm's length interest rate or spent. The exceptions do not applyto reserve or replacement funds (other than bona fide debt service funds),to proceeds subject to arbitrage yield restrictions, or to accounts formedor availed of to take advantage of the exception and deflect arbitrageprofits to third parties. The purpose of the exceptions is to further simplifycomputation of the rebatable arbitrage under the future value method. Under the first exception, no receipt is imputed to investments of smallbalances in a nonpurpose receipt account. This rule facilitates the nettingof nonpurpose receipts and payments. The investment activity in the nonpurposereceipt account can be disregarded for purposes of computing the rebatablearbitrage, since all the receipts in the account are reinvested. The investmentsin the account, however, are taken into account in determining the amountof the rebatable arbitrage (<T3>e.g., </T3>as zero yielding investments if the account does not payinterest). Under the second exception, receipts are not imputed to investments ofsignificantly larger balances in a nonpurpose receipt account, a purposereceipt account, or a checking account to produce a yield higher than theyield on the issue. This rule also simplifies the computation. For example,the rule allows an issuer to treat amounts deposited in a qualified checkingaccount as if they were spent on the date of the deposit. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Special Rules for Restricted Escrows </ITAG>Special rules apply to investments in restricted escrows. An investmentis in a restricted escrow if the investment is in an advance refundingescrow or an excess proceeds escrow. These rules are necessary primarilyto accommodate advance refundings. The rules reflect the economic realitythat all investments in a restricted escrow (whether or not held concurrently)are part of a single ``locked in'' investment. Nonpurpose investments are in an advance refunding escrow if allocated(without regard to transferred proceeds rules) to proceeds of a refundingissue that are to be used to discharge principal or interest on a refundedissue or that are part of a reserve or replacement fund (until the adjustedmaturity date of the refunded issue) unless the proceeds qualify for atemporary period longer than 30 days. Nonpurpose investments (not in an advance refunding escrow or part of areasonably required reserve or replacement fund) are in an excess proceedsescrow if allocated (without regard to transferred proceeds rules) to proceedsthat are to be used to discharge principal or interest (other than accruedor capitalized interest) on the issue to which the proceeds are allocated.Amounts to be used to pay debt service are not part of a reasonably requiredreserve or replacement fund unless the purpose of the fund is to covera temporary shortfall in revenues (or the fund is a bona fide debt servicefund). For example, an escrow fund established to defease bonds (legallyor economically) is not reasonably required. The special rules that apply to investments in restricted escrows are asfollows: 1. <T3>Installment date receipt. </T3>The installment date receipt is alwaysdetermined by reference to present value. 2. <T3>Transferred investments. </T3>If the investments transfer to a refundingissue, the present value is always treated as the nonpurpose receipt withrespect to the refunded issue and as the nonpurpose payment with respectto the refunding issue. (This rule generally does not apply if the refundedissue is a tax-exempt issue to which the rebate requirement applies unlessthe refunding issue also is tax-exempt.) 3. <T3>Composite yield. </T3>The present value is determined by treating allinvestments in the same restricted escrow as one investment (whether ornot the investments are held concurrently). Therefore, the discount rateused in computing the present value of the investments is the compositeyield on all the investments (not the yield on the investments that happento be in the escrow on a particular date). 4. <T3>Imputed escrow receipts. </T3>Section 1.148-5 provides that receiptsare imputed to investments in an escrow in certain cases. For purposesof these rules, investments in an escrow include tax-exempt investmentsand investments allocated to gross proceeds (other than proceeds). The first rule provides that interest savings directly attributable tothe defeasance of bonds with investments in an escrow are treated as imputedreceipts with respect to those investments. These savings might occur if,as a result of the defeasance, the interest rate on the defeased bondsis reduced, or fees for a guarantee of the defeased bonds no longer haveto be paid. A transition rule applies to bonds sold on or before May 15,1989, and issued on or before June 14, 1989. The transition rule does notapply to any refunding issue issued after August 31, 1986 and to whichsection 149(d)(4) (relating to abusive advance refunding transactions)applies unless certain interest savings are taken into account in computingthe yield on the refunding issue. The second rule provides that excess receipts from tax-exempt investmentsin an escrow established after June 14, 1989, are treated as imputed receiptswith respect to nonpurpose investments in the same escrow. Excess receiptsmay arise if the tax-exempt investments are invested at a yield higherthan one eighth percent above the yield on the nonpurpose investments inthe same escrow. The excess receipts are the receipts on the tax-exemptinvestments that produce this excess yield. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Certain Lower Yielding Investments Not Taken Into Account </ITAG>Two classes of nonpurpose investments are not taken into account in computingthe rebatable arbitrage if the yield on the class as a whole is lower thanthe yield on the issue. The first class comprises all investments (includingtransferred investments) in advance refunding escrows and all transferredinvestments in excess proceeds escrows. The second class comprises allinvestments allocated to gross proceeds (other than proceeds) that arepart of a reserve or replacement fund that is neither reasonably requirednor a bona fide debt service fund. Congress provided the Treasury Department with broad general regulatoryauthority under section 148 and section 149(d) (relating to advance refundings)and specific authority under section 148(f)(6)(B) to determine what grossproceeds include. The netting limitations herein constitute a necessaryexercise of such authority. The limitations are necessary because a tax-exemptissuer enjoys a tax arbitrage benefit whenever the bond proceeds are invested(unless the bond proceeds are invested exclusively in tax-exempt investments).This benefit is equal to the interest rate differential between the tax-exemptissue and a comparable taxable issue.The two classes of funds to which the netting limitations apply are long-terminvestment funds that involve major exploitation of arbitrage. These fundsrarely, if ever, exist outside the tax-exempt bond market. The nettinglimitations prevent these funds from being used to exploit arbitrage twice.The double exploitation would occur if the funds were invested at taxableinterest rates and also were used to eliminate rebatable arbitrage profitsfrom investing other, unrelated funds at taxable interest rates. The advancerefunding escrow limitation prevents advance refunding issues from enjoyinga rebate advantage as compared to the refunded and all other issues. Thesinking fund limitation prevents sinking funds from being established andunreasonably accumulated for the primary (if not sole) purpose of eliminatingrebatable arbitrage profits. These limitations do not prevent negativearbitrage profits from the investment of other, unrelated funds from beingused to offset positive arbitrage profits from the investment of thesefunds.V. Computation of Yield on Issue<ITAG tagnum="81">A. In General</ITAG>Section 1.148-3T distinguishes between fixed yield issues and variableyield issues. A fixed yield issue includes only fixed yield bonds. A variableyield issue includes one or more variable yield bonds.A variable yield bond includes any bond the interest rate on which is determinedby reference to market interest rates after the date of issue. A bond isnot a variable yield bond merely because the interest rate will change(<T3>e.g.,</T3> to another interest rate fixed and determinable as of thedate of issue) or may change in the event of an unanticipated event (<T3>e.g.,</T3> if there is a change in income tax rates).The yield on a fixed yield issue is the same throughout the term of theissue. For purposes of computing the rebatable arbitrage as of each installmentcomputation date, the expected actual yield on the issue as of the computationdate is used to future value the nonpurpose receipts and payments fromthe date of issue to the computation date. On the final computation date,the actual yield on the issue over the term of the issue is used to futurevalue the nonpurpose receipts and payments from the date of issue to thefinal computation date.In contrast, the yield on a variable yield issue changes each yield period.For purposes of computing the rebatable arbitrage, the nonpurpose receiptsand payments are future valued during each yield period at an interestrate equal to the yield on the issue computed separately for that yieldperiod. Each yield period ends on a computation date (<T3>e.g.,</T3> the first yield period ends on the last day of the fifthbond year). The issuer may elect to treat the last day of any other bondyear as the end of another yield period. The yield, therefore, may be computedfor each 5-year period or more often (in any combination of 1-year periods).Under the variable yield rules, the rebatable arbitrage reflects the amountearned on each investment in excess of the interest cost on the issue duringthe yield period the investment is held. Computation of the rebatable arbitrageon a yield period basis minimizes distortions from changes in market interestrates. For example, if the yield on an issue of long-term current indexbonds was recomputed over the term of the issue, the rebatable arbitragefrom investing during the construction period would change later if interestrates changed. The issuer could not recover rebate payments if interestrates rose (at least 90 percent must be paid each 5 years), but the issuerwould have to rebate more if interest rates fell. The issuer should nothave to rebate more, since the arbitrage profits do not in fact change.The variable yield rules apply to tender bonds that bear interest at short-termrates during the construction period (when the proceeds are invested) andthereafter convert to a long-term fixed interest rate. As applied to theseissues, the rules are also necessary to minimize distortions from comparingthe current short-term investment rates and the future long-term borrowingrates. Although yield curve distortions can occur in connection with long-termfixed rate issues, there is a fundamental difference between a long-termfixed rate bond and a tender bond. The issuer of a long-term fixed ratebond agrees in advance to pay a fixed rate of interest over the term ofthe bond. As discussed below, the yield on such a bond should not be viewedas changing because market interest rates later change. By contrast, theyield on a tender bond changes whenever the interest rate on the bond isreset. Moreover, the conversion of a tender bond to a long-term fixed ratebond resembles the refunding of a short-term bond with a long-term bond.A refunding issue is a separate issue and involves a separate yield andrebatable arbitrage computation.A transition rule provides that the issuer of any variable yield issuesold on or before May 15, 1989, and issued on or before June 14, 1989,may elect to treat the issue as a fixed yield issue. If the issuer so elects,the yield on the issue is computed over the term of the issue.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Issue Price</ITAG>The yield on a bond or issue is determined on the basis of the issue priceto the public. The issue price of substantially identical bonds that arepublicly offered generally is the initial offering price at which pricea substantial amount of the bonds was sold to the public. This price generallyis determined on the basis of reasonable expectations as of the date theissuer enters into a binding contract to sell the bonds if the underwriteror other intermediary makes a bona fide public offering of the bonds atthe reasonably expected price. The issue price of bonds to be sold afterthe date of issue must be adjusted to reflect an equivalent date of issueprice (<T3>e.g.,</T3> interest accrued after the date of issue is not taken intoaccount).<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Actually Paid</ITAG>Payments of principal and interest on a bond that are unconditionally payablegenerally are treated as if paid on the date actually and unconditionallydue (whether or not actually paid on that date) unless the yield is higherby taking into account payments when actually paid (<T3>i.e.,</T3> where taking into account late payments and interest onthe late payments produces a higher yield).This special rule applies only if the bondholders are reasonably assuredthat sufficient funds will be available to fully retire the bonds if noneor an insubstantial portion of the proceeds are used for a governmentalpurpose. For this purpose, the available funds are reduced by the arbitrageprofits (determined without regard to the special rule), and funds areconsidered available only if there is a binding obligation of a personwith sufficient funds to provide them. This exception is necessary to preventarbitrage profits from being used to pay the issuance costs of collapsiblebond issues. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Qualified Guarantees </ITAG>Section 1.103-13(c)(8) provides that premiums paid to insure an issue aretaken into account in computing the yield on the issue. Under andSection;1.103-13(c)(5), payments for other bond guarantees (<T3>e.g</T3>., letters of credit) and for guarantees of purpose investmentsare taken into account in computing the yield on purpose investments, butnot in computing the yield on the issue. The distinction under prior lawbetween bond insurance and other bond guarantees is eliminated. In some cases, the terms of a purpose investment may be virtually identicalto the terms of the bonds, and the obligor on the purpose investment mayeven be treated for other tax purposes as the obligor on the bonds. Inthese cases, a guarantee of the purpose investment is treated as a guaranteeof the bonds, rather than as a project-related credit enhancement featureof the bonds. This treatment applies if: (1) The purpose investment isacquired with sale proceeds of the issue; (2) the payments on the purposeinvestment are exclusively and unconditionally pledged to pay the bonds;(3) the payments on the purpose investment coincide with the payments onthe bonds; and (4) the yield on the purpose investment does not exceedthe yield on the issue by more than one-eighth percent. The last requirementmay be satisfied by modifying the purpose investment to comply with therequirement if the purpose investment is acquired on or before June 14,1989. In addition, special rules are provided that permit purpose investmentguarantees to be treated as bond guarantees in certain cases even thoughthe payments on the purpose investment and the bonds do not exactly coincide,and even though the payments on the purpose investment are not exclusivelypledged to pay the bonds. These rules: (1) Treat payments on a purposeinvestment and a bond as coinciding where the purpose investment providesfor monthly payments of principal and interest and the bonds provide forsemiannual or annual payments of principal and interest; and (2) treatpayments on a purpose investment as exclusively pledged to pay the bondswhere the bonds are equally and ratably secured with other bonds undera master resolution if all bonds issued under the master resolution areused only to finance purpose investments that are insured by the same guarantor(<T3>e.g</T3>., by the Federal Government). A guarantee is an unconditional obligation of a guarantor enforceable byor on behalf of the bondholder to pay principal or interest on the bondor the tender price of a tender bond. The guarantee may be in the formof an insurance policy, surety bond, irrevocable letter or line of credit,or standby purchase agreement. A line of credit obtained for liquidityreasons is not a guarantee unless the bondholders can unconditionally relyon it. A guarantee also may be in the form of a recourse loan to the guarantor(where the guarantor re-loans the proceeds to the ultimate borrower) ifthe terms of the loan and the bonds are virtually identical. The guarantor must be the Federal Government or an entity that is subjectto Federal income tax and is either a bank or rated ``AA'' or ``AAA'' bya nationally recognized rating agency. The guarantor must be legally entitledto full reimbursement immediately or upon commercially reasonable repaymentterms (during a workout period that is not unreasonably long). An obligationto pay is not a guarantee unless it is reasonably expected that the guarantorwill not be called upon to make any payment under the guarantee (or willbe reimbursed immediately in cash for any payment). For example, a commitmentto make a permanent loan is not a guarantee (whether or not the commitmentis unconditional). Payments for the guarantee may not exceed a reasonable charge for the transferof credit risk and may not include direct or indirect payment for a cost,risk, or other element that is not customarily borne by guarantors of tax-exemptbonds (in transactions in which the guarantor has no other involvement).The reasonable charge requirement is not satisfied unless it is reasonablyexpected that the guarantee will result in a net present value savings.A nonguarantee element is present, for example, if the guarantee is inthe form of a loan to the guarantor unless payments for all nonguaranteeservices being provided by the guarantor fully and adequately compensatethe guarantor for those services (and no portion of such payments is takeninto account as a payment for the guarantee). The fees charged for thenonguarantee services must be separately stated if the guarantee is enteredinto after June 14, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Allocation Rules for Guarantees  </ITAG>Rules are provided for allocating payments for guarantees to the bondsguaranteed and, if the bonds are variable yield bonds, to the proper yieldperiod. In general, level payments are allocated in accordance with thelevel payment formula and treated as paid when actually paid. Nonlevel(front-loaded or back-loaded) payments are reallocated. A level payment generally is one of a series of payments determined byuse of the same formula (<T3>e.g</T3>., a series of payments all of which are based on a constantpercentage of the amount of guaranteed bonds then outstanding plus an appropriateamount of accrued interest). The series of payments must be payable atregular intervals (<T3>e.g</T3>., on the first day of each bond year, properly adjusted totake into account any short year).  Nonlevel payments generally are allocated to each guaranteed bond in thesame proportion as the interest savings resulting from the guarantee. Forexample, if the guaranteed bonds are not all substantially identical, thenonlevel payments are allocated to each group of substantially identicalguaranteed bonds in the same proportion as the total interest savings withrespect to the group bears to the total interest savings with respect toall the guaranteed bonds (determined on a present value basis). Paymentsallocated to substantially identical bonds are allocated ratably.Nonlevel payments allocated to a variable yield bond generally are treatedas paid on the first day the guarantee is in effect and on the first dayof each succeeding bond year during which the guarantee is in effect. Thesame amount is treated as paid each bond year (other than a short year).The present value of all the amounts treated as paid equals the presentvalue of all the nonlevel payments, using a discount rate equal to theyield on all the guaranteed bonds during the first yield period duringwhich the guarantee is in effect (determined without regard to the nonlevelpayments). All guarantees entered into with the same guarantor before thefirst installment computation date generally are treated as one guaranteefor purposes of applying these rules. If a guaranteed variable yield bond is actually retired before maturity,the amount treated as paid during the bond year is prorated. No other amountswith respect to the bond are thereafter taken into account with respectto the issue. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Hedging Transactions </ITAG>Certain hedging transactions, such as those involving interest rate swapsand interest rate caps or collars, should be taken into account in computingthe yield on the issue. The rules relating to hedging transactions arereserved. Public comments are invited regarding the types of hedging transactionsthat should be taken into account, the methods that should be used to determinewhether a particular hedging transaction is entered into with respect toa particular issue, and the method that should be used to take into accountpayments with respect to each type of transaction. Issuers should be awarethat the regulations will apply to interest rate swaps that involve theswap of a fixed rate of interest for a variable rate of interest, and thatthese swaps may be taken into account in determining whether the issueis a variable yield issue. VI. Computation of Yield on Fixed Yield Issue <ITAG tagnum="81">A. In General </ITAG>The yield on a fixed yield issue as of any computation date is determinedby taking into account the issue payments paid on or before the computationdate and to be paid after the computation date. The issue payments paidare the amounts paid to discharge principal and interest (not includingamounts paid in connection with the early retirement of a bond), the earlyretirement value of bonds retired before maturity, and the amounts paidfor a qualified guarantee. The issue payments to be paid after the computationdate generally are determined by assuming that the bonds will remain outstandinguntil maturity (unless the bonds are subject to mandatory early redemptionor otherwise are required to be retired early). <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Early Retirements </ITAG>The early retirement value of a bond (rather than the amount actually paidto retire the bond) is treated as the issue payment when a bond is retiredbefore the final maturity date. The early retirement value generally isthe price that when used in computing the actual bond yield (the yieldto the actual retirement date) produces the original bond yield (the yieldto the final maturity date). The price that preserves the original bond yield is the present value asof the early retirement date of the originally scheduled payments of principaland interest (and payments for a guarantee) to be paid on or after thatdate, discounted at an interest rate equal to the yield-to-maturity onthe bond. The present va]ue of a bond issued at par plus accrued interestis approximately the par amount of the bond plus accrued interest (if thebond pays current interest). This approximate present value can be usedinstead of actually computing the exact present value. The exact presentvalue may have to be computed for guaranteed bonds and bonds that are issuedat a discount (or premium). The present value of these bonds increases(or decreases) as the discount (or premium) accrues, so that the actualyield on the bond is always the same. The actual price paid to retire the bond is not used, because changes inmarket interest rates should not be viewed as changing the yield on a fixedyield bond. Economically, the yield over the original term of a noncallablefixed yield bond never changes. If the issuer retires the bond early, themarket premium (or discount) paid to retire the bond will reflect the lower(or higher) current market interest rate, which is the same rate at whichthe early retirement is financed. Financing of the early retirement witha new borrowing will change the timing of the originally scheduled payments,but will not change the present value of the payments or the yield overthe original term of the bond. Financing of the early retirement with equityalso produces the same results on a present value basis (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the same result as if the equity had been invested at thecurrent market rate and the bond had not been retired, and the same resultas if the bond had been retired with new borrowing at the current marketrate). Similarly, the yield over the original term of a callable bond should notbe viewed as increasing if the bond is retired early. In this case, theyield with respect to the financing over the original term of the bondmay actually decrease. For example, the yield over the original term ofa 9 percent 30-year bond would decrease if the bond was called after 10years at a 3 percent call premium to take advantage of a lower 6 percentinterest rate. The higher original bond yield is used for purposes of computingthe rebatable arbitrage whether or not the bond is called early (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the yield is not reduced to take into account the valueof the call option or the fact that it is exercised). Issuers should be aware, however, that the issuance of callable bonds forthe primary or sole purpose of hedging against a rise in interest ratesmay violate,<T3> inter alia</T3>, the 10-percent reserve or replacement fund financinglimitation added by the 1986 Act. See, H. Rep. No. 100-795, 100th Cong.447, 451 (1988). Rules relating to this limitation will be the subjectof a future notice. A bond may be subject to optional purchase or redemption at a small discountbelow present value. For example, a 30-year bond issued at a one percentpremium may be subject to optional redemption at par after 20 years. Inthis case, it is initially assumed that the yield on the bond is the higheryield-to-maturity rather than the lower yield to the par call date. Ifthe bond is part of a fixed yield issue and is retired at or about thetime the bond is subject to redemption at a price less than present value,the lower redemption price is the early retirement value (rather than thehigher present value).In extraordinary cases, a bond may be subject to optional purchase or redemptionbefore maturity at a substantial discount below present value. In thiscase, it is initially assumed that the yield on the bond is the yield-to-call(<T3>i.e</T3>., the yield computed by treating the optional purchase orcall date as the final maturity date). A bond that is part of a fixed yieldissue is a yield-to-call bond if the yield-to-maturity on the bond is morethan one- fourth percent higher than the lowest yield. If the bond is notretired on or before the call date, the bond is treated as if issued onthat date for an issue price equal to the lower call price. The bond, therefore,is treated as a lower yielding bond before the call date and as a higheryielding bond after the call date (assuming the bond is still outstandingafter the call date). A yield-to-call bond does not cause the issue ofwhich the bond is a part to be treated as a variable yield issue. In some cases, bonds may be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemptionbefore the final maturity date. If these bonds are issued at a discount,the present value of the bonds on the mandatory early redemption dateswould be less than par if the yield-to-maturity were used as the discountrate in computing the present value. If the bonds are not issued at a largediscount, the issuer expects to redeem the bonds at par (rather than ata lower market price), and the yield on each bond is actually the compositeyield-to-maturity on all the bonds, determined by treating the mandatoryearly redemption dates and prices as the final maturity dates and prices.This higher composite yield is used as the discount rate in computing thepresent value of each bond when it is retired (and each bond is treatedas maturing on a mandatory redemption date for purposes of computing thepresent value). The actual yield on the bonds, therefore, is always thecomposite yield-to-maturity on all the bonds (regardless of when or atwhat price the bonds are retired). The lower yield-to-maturity is usedfor purposes of determining the issue payments to be paid if the bondsare issued at a deep discount. A single loan that provides for partial principal payments before the finalprincipal payment is due is treated as a series of separate bonds thatare subject to mandatory early redemption. The yield on the loan is alwaysthe composite yield-to-maturity on all the bonds. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Special Rule for Small Issues </ITAG>Unless the issuer otherwise elects, the yield on certain small fixed yieldissues is the expected actual yield as of the date of issue. This yieldis computed in the same manner as the actual yield, except that the dateof issue is treated as the only computation date. Thus, actual facts afterthe date of issue (including early retirements) are not taken into account.For this purpose, an issue is a small issue if the aggregate issue priceof the bonds is $5 million or less. This amount is increased to $10 millionfor governmental issues if the aggregate issue price of all tax-exemptbonds (other than private activity bonds) issued by the issuer and certainrelated issuers during the same and the immediately preceding calendaryears is $30 million or less. The special rule applies only if: (1) It is reasonably expected that noinvestments (other than purpose investments) will be subject to arbitrageyield restrictions; (2) the issuer at no time enters into a hedging transactionthat is taken into account in computing the yield on the issue and that,if taken into account, would increase the rebatable arbitrage; and (3)at least 75 percent of the net sale proceeds are used for a governmentalpurpose within 3 years of the date of issue. This 3-year requirement isapplied in the same way as the net sale proceeds requirement that appliesfor purposes of the computation date credit. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Transition Rule for Fixed Yield Issues </ITAG>A transition rule provides that, unless the issuer otherwise elects, theyield on a fixed yield issue sold on or before May 15, 1989, and issuedon or before June 14, 1989, is the expected actual yield on the issue,computed by treating the date of issue as the only computation date. This transition rule applies only if: (1) The issuer at no time entersinto a hedging transaction that is taken into account in computing theyield on the issue and that, if taken into account, would increase therebatable arbitrage; and (2) at least 25 percent of the net sale proceedsare used for a governmental purpose within 3 years of the date of issue.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Transitioned Variable Yield Bonds </ITAG>Special rules are provided for determining the issue payments in connectionwith variable yield bonds that are part of a fixed yield issue. The issuepayments paid generally are determined in the same manner as if the issuewere a variable yield issue, except that the term of the issue is the yieldperiod. The interest to be paid after a computation date is determinedby assuming that market interest rates in effect on the computation datedo not later change. If a tender bond converts to a fixed rate, the bondis thereafter treated as a fixed yield bond for purposes of determiningthe issue payments paid and to be paid. VII. Computation of Yield on Variable Yield Issue <ITAG tagnum="81">A. General Rule </ITAG>The yield on a variable yield issue during a yield period is determinedby taking into account the issue payments attributable to the yield periodand the issue prices of bonds issued during the yield period. The issuepayments attributable to the yield period include the early retirementvalue of the bonds outstanding at the end of the yield period, and thesesame bonds are treated as if issued at the beginning of the next yieldperiod for the same value. In effect, the bonds are treated as if retiredand reissued at the end of each yield period for purposes of computingthe yield. A variable yield issue may include tender bonds, other variable yield bonds,and fixed yield bonds. Separate rules are provided for each type of bond.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Tender Bonds </ITAG>Variable yield bonds are tender bonds if the holders are entitled to tenderthe bonds for purchase at par on one or more tender dates, and all intereston the bonds accrues (and is currently paid) at the lowest rate that wouldpermit the bonds to be remarketed at par on each tender date. The issue payments attributable to a yield period include: (1) Any interestthat accrued and was paid during the yield period; (2) the tender priceof any bond tendered during the yield period; (3) the par amount of anybond retired during the yield period; and (4) the par amount plus unpaidaccrued interest (as of the date the interest is scheduled to be paid)of any bond outstanding at the end of the yield period. Remarketed bonds are treated as if issued after the close of business onthe date remarketed. The issue price should equal (and offset) the tenderprice if the bond is remarketed on the tender date. A bond outstandingat the end of the yield period is treated as if issued at the beginningof the next yield period for the par amount. A tender bond that converts to a fixed rate is thereafter treated as afixed yield bond. The issue payment taken into account with respect tothe tender bond is the par amount plus unpaid accrued interest (as of thedate the interest is scheduled to be paid). The fixed yield bond is treatedas if issued for the par amount.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Other Variable Yield Bonds </ITAG>In the case of all other variable yield bonds, the issue payments attributableto a yield period include: (1) Interest that accrued and was paid duringthe yield period; (2) the early retirement value of any bond retired beforematurity during the yield period; (3) the retirement price of any bondretired at maturity during the yield period; and (4) the early retirementvalue plus unpaid accrued interest (as of the date the interest is scheduledto be paid) of any bond outstanding at the end of the yield period. For purposes of applying the yield-to-call and early retirement value rulesto these bonds: (1) Interest on a bond that is determined by referenceto market interest rates after the date of issue (<T3>e.g., </T3>by reference to the prime rate of a designated financialinstitution) is assumed to be paid on the basis of market interest ratesas of the date of issue (<T3>e.g., </T3>the prime rate as of the date of issue is assumed to remainthe same throughout the term of the issue); (2) payments for a guaranteeare taken into account only for purposes of determining whether the bondis a yield-to-call bond; and (3) the early retirement value on any dayis determined without regard to unpaid accrued interest at the assumedrate (<T3>e.g., </T3>if the early retirement value otherwise would be par plusthe present value of the unpaid accrued interest, the early retirementvalue is par). A bond (other than a tender bond) that is part of a variable yield issueis a yield-to-call bond if the yield-to-maturity on the bond is higherthan the yield-to-call unless the bond is a fixed yield bond or a currentindex bond. A fixed yield bond or current index bond is a yield-to-callbond only if the yield-to-maturity on the bond is more than one sixteenthpercent higher than the yield-to-call. A variable yield bond is a currentindex bond if all interest on the bond accrues (and is currently paid)at rates that are based on a single interest index or that are fixed anddeterminable as of the date of issue. A bond outstanding at the end of a yield period is treated as if issuedat the beginning of the next yield period for the early retirement value.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Fixed Yield Bonds </ITAG>The issue payments in connection with fixed yield bonds that are attributableto a yield period generally are determined in the same manner as for fixedyield bonds that are part of a fixed yield issue. The amount treated asan issue payment on the last day of a yield period is the early retirementvalue (less principal and interest paid that day). The bond is treatedas if issued at the beginning of the next yield period for the same value.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Conversion to Fixed Yield Issue </ITAG>Unless the issuer otherwise elects, a variable yield issue is treated asa fixed yield issue as of the first day of a yield period if the issuewould be a fixed yield issue if issued that day. For example, if the firstyield period for an issue of tender bonds ends on the last day of the thirdbond year and all the bonds convert to a fixed rate during the third bondyear, the issue is treated as a fixed yield issue as of the first day ofthe fourth bond year. If the first yield period ended on the last day ofthe fifth bond year, the issue would be treated as a fixed yield issueas of the first day of the sixth bond year. Each bond is treated as ifissued for the same amount that would have been taken into account as theissue price if the issue had remained a variable yield issue. The yieldon the issue is thereafter computed in the same manner as for a fixed yieldissue. VIII. Allocation and Accounting Rules <ITAG tagnum="81">A. In General </ITAG>Section 1.148-4T provides generally that an investment is allocated toan issue for the period: (1) That begins on the date gross proceeds areallocated to the issue and to the investment; and (2) that ends on thedate such gross proceeds cease to be allocated to the issue or to the investment.Less than all the gross proceeds may be allocated to the issue in certaincases if the unspent gross proceeds substantially exceed the outstandingamount of the issue. Most of the rules for allocating gross proceeds to investments and expendituresare reserved. These rules will provide when proceeds of an issue that arenot directly used to pay an expenditure may be allocated to the expenditure.In this connection, issuers should be aware that the use of proceeds ofan issue to fund an investment fund does not result in a reduction in theamount of the unspent gross proceeds of the issue. Even if the proceedswere allocated to expenditures rather than to the investments in the fund,the investments would still be allocated to gross proceeds (other thanthe proceeds) if the investment fund is a direct or indirect replacementfund for the issue. Compare, Revenue Ruling 82-101. See, also, section148(d)(2). <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Gross Proceeds </ITAG>Gross proceeds include proceeds and funds (other than proceeds) that arepart of a reserve or replacement fund. Proceeds include original, discount,and transferred proceeds. Original proceeds include sale proceeds (amountsreceived from the sale of the issue) and investment proceeds (amounts receivedfrom investing original proceeds). Public comments are invited regardingthe appropriate scope of an exception for investment earnings that arecommingled with substantial other revenues of the issuer. The definitions of discount proceeds and reserve or replacement funds arereserved. Discount proceeds may arise in certain cases if the amount ofoutstanding bonds substantially increases during the term of the issuebecause the bonds do not pay interest currently. If discount proceeds arise,the proceeds would be allocated to investments or expenditures as appropriate.Reserve or replacement funds include certain pledged and sinking fundsthat were treated as proceeds under prior law. Issuers should be awarethat funds of the issuer or a beneficiary of the financing (or relatedperson) indirectly pledged to pay debt service on the issue are part ofa reserve or replacement fund (<T3>e.g., </T3>funds pledged by an issuer to reimburse a guarantor in theevent the guarantor is called upon to make a payment under the guaranteeare gross proceeds). <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Indirect Use </ITAG>Proceeds of an issue may be used directly to acquire one investment andindirectly to acquire another investment. Any reference in the temporaryregulations to proceeds is to be construed to include a reference to proceedsused directly or indirectly. If proceeds are used directly and indirectly,the proceeds are treated as used directly or indirectly (whichever producesthe larger amount of rebatable arbitrage). The indirect use of proceeds of a refunding issue is illustrated in andSection;1.148-8T(d)(9)(ii) (Examples). These examples illustrate that an indirectuse occurs if fully fungible dollars are substituted for other fully fungibledollars solely for tax reasons, and the substitution involves a changein the purpose for which the funds are to be used. The indirect use conceptin section 148(a) and andSection; 1.103-13(b)(1), and the requirement inandSection; 1.103-13(f)(4)(ii) that investments purchased with proceeds ofa refunding issue must be allocated to such proceeds, implicate and givemeaning to one another. A fundamental principle of Federal income taxationis that the substance of a transaction controls if the form of the transactionhas no bona fide business purpose other than tax avoidance. This rule applieseven when there is no reference to ``indirectly'' in the Code or regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Nonpurpose Investment </ITAG>Nonpurpose investment includes any taxable investment other than a purposeinvestment. Purpose investment means any investment (including a tax-exemptbond) that is allocated to gross proceeds of an issue, and that is acquiredin order to carry out the governmental purpose of the issue. The use ofgross proceeds to make a loan to a borrower in order to carry out the governmentalpurpose of the issue is not, in itself, an expenditure of the gross proceeds.The use of the gross proceeds by the borrower to finance expenditures isthe relevant expenditure. Taxable investments by the borrower prior toactual expenditure of the gross proceeds are nonpurpose investments. Arbitrage earned on purpose investments is not subject to rebate undersection 148(f). In addition, amounts received with respect to purpose investmentsare not treated as sale or investment proceeds to the extent properly allocatedto recoverable administrative costs or to the permitted one eighth percenthigher yield. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Check Expenditures </ITAG>An expenditure of proceeds in a checking or similar account may be treatedas made on the date a negotiable check is written on the account if thecheck is delivered or mailed no later than one business day thereafter,and the payor has no reason to believe that the check will not clear withina reasonable period of time. If the check is delivered or mailed more thanone business day after it is written, the expenditure may be treated asoccurring on the date of delivery or mailing. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Refunding Escrows </ITAG>Allocation rules are provided for excess gross proceeds of a refunded issue.These rules apply for purposes of section 148 generally. First, excess replacement funds and excess proceeds of a refunded issueare allocated to investments in the escrow that are to be used to dischargethe refunded issue. Second, the excess replacement funds and excess proceedsare allocated to investments in the escrow so that these amounts are usedto discharge the refunded issue before sale proceeds of the refunding issueare so used. In other words, the refunding proceeds in the escrow are allocatedto the investments that are to be used to discharge the latest paymentsof principal and interest. Excess replacement funds of a refunded issue generally include gross proceeds(other than proceeds) of the refunded issue that at or around the timeof issuance of the refunding issue were part of a sinking fund for therefunded issue and that are not thereafter part of a reasonably requiredreserve or replacement fund or bona fide debt service fund for the refundedissue or part of a sinking fund for the refunding issue. Excess replacementfunds also include all amounts that were accumulated in a bona fide debtservice fund for the refunded portion of the refunded issue. No inferenceis intended that the freeing up of pledged (non-sinking) funds in connectionwith a refunding cannot involve a replacement. Excess proceeds of a refunded issue generally include proceeds of the refundedissue that are to be used to discharge principal or interest on the refundedissue, or that were to be used to pay capitalized interest on the refundedportion of the refunded issue. A transition rule applies (for purposes of section 148(f)) to refundingissues sold on or before May 15, 1989, and issued on or before June 14,1989. If the transition rule applies, the first allocation rule does notapply, and the second allocation rule applies only to refunding issuesissued after August 31, 1986 and to which section 149(d)(4) (relating toabusive advance refunding transactions) applies. If the second allocationrule applies, the rule applies only to excess replacement funds that weregross proceeds of the refunded issue before the refunding and were notpart of a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund or used to defeasebonds (legally or economically) before the refunding and excess proceedsthat were to be used to pay capitalized interest. In addition, the ruleapplies only for purposes of determining the extent to which proceeds ofthe refunded issue become transferred proceeds of the refunding issue (notfor purposes of determining the rebatable arbitrage with respect to investmentsof proceeds of the refunding issue other than transferred proceeds). <ITAG tagnum="81">G. Transferred Proceeds </ITAG>Section 1.103-14(e)(2)(ii) provides that proceeds of a refunded issue becometransferred proceeds of the refunding issue when the refunding proceedsdischarge principal of the refunded issue. Unspent and spent proceeds transferratably. The transferred proceeds rule has been modified. The new ruleapplies for purposes of section 148 generally. Under the new rule, the proceeds of the refunded issue become transferredproceeds of the refunding issue when the refunding proceeds discharge principalor interest on the refunded issue. The same amount of proceeds generallybecome transferred proceeds as the amount of the proceeds used to dischargesuch principal or interest. However, in the case of an advance refundingissue to which section 149(d)(4) applies, no transfer occurs on a dateto the extent that the transfer would cause the value of the investmentsallocated to the refunding portion of the refunding issue to exceed bymore than 10 percent the value of the outstanding bonds allocated (on apro rata basis) to the refunding portion of the issue. Unspent proceedsbecome transferred proceeds before spent proceeds. For this purpose, proceedsinvested exclusively in a purpose investment are spent.The new transferred proceeds rule is simpler. The proceeds are allocatedto expenditures on a first-in, first-out basis. The new rule also moreaccurately reflects the economics of the replacement. To the extent ofthe unspent proceeds of the refunded issue, the refunding really involvesa replacement (rather than a true refunding). The new rule eliminates anybenefit from the replacement by eliminating the replacement.A transition rule applies (for purposes of section 148(f)) to refundingissues sold on or before May 15, 1989 and issued on or before June 14,1989. If the transition rule applies, the transferred proceeds of the refundingissue are determined as provided in andSection; 1.103-14(e)(2)(ii).The transition rule does not apply to refunding issues issued after August31, 1986 that (if the transition rule did apply) would be described insection 149(d)(4) (relating to abusive advance refunding transactions).This exception is intended to apply to an advance refunding that was deliberatelystructured to earn arbitrage profits through employment of the window refundingdevice described in the legislative history of section 149(d)(4). See,S. Rep. No. 99-313, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 850, 851 (1986) (Example (4)).IX. Elections.Elections under the regulations must be in writing and signed by an authorizedrepresentative of the issuer no later than the later of: (1) The date ofissue; or (2) if the issue is issued on or before November 15, 1989, thefirst date after June 14, 1989, that any rebate is paid or required tobe paid to the United States. An election is not effective unless the electionidentifies the issue to which it applies and is maintained as part of theofficial transcript of the proceedings relating to the issuance. Elections,once made, generally are not revocable.X. Rules Applicable for Section 148 GenerallySection 1.148-9T provides that the following rules apply for purposes ofsection 148 generally:1. The rules for computing the yield on a fixed yield issue apply for purposesof section 148(a) and (d)(3). For this purpose, the date of issue is treatedas the only computation date.2. For purposes of section 148, the yield on nonpurpose investments notpurchased with gross proceeds (<T3>e.g.,</T3> investments purchased before the date of issue and contributedto a debt service reserve fund for the issue) is determined on the basisof the same purchase price that is used for purposes of computing the rebatablearbitrage (<T3>e.g.,</T3> a purchase price equal to the fair market value of the investmenton the date the investment is allocated to the gross proceeds).3. The special refunding allocation rules and transferred proceeds ruleapply for purposes of section 148. In addition, receipts imputed to aninvestment in an escrow are treated as interest on the investment for purposesof section 148.4. A rule that provides that certain perpetual trust funds are not treatedas reserve or replacement funds applies for purposes of section 148.5. The definition of investment property applies for purposes of section148.Section 1.148-9T generally applies to issues sold after May 15, 1989 orissued after June 14, 1989XI. Abusive Advance Refunding TransactionsSection 149(d)(4) provides that interest on a bond is not tax-exempt ifany bond that is part of the issue is issued to advance refund anotherbond and a device is employed in connection with the issuance to obtainany material financial advantage (based on arbitrage) apart from savingsattributable to lower interest rates. Advance refundings are sophisticatedfinancial transactions that present serious potential for arbitrage abuse.Section 1.149(d)-1T(d)(2) provides that any issue to which section 149(d)(4)and the rebate requirement apply that fails to meet the rebate requirementis issued in connection with such a device.XII. Definitions and Special Rules Relating to Tax-Exempt Bond Requirementsin GeneralSection 1.150-1T includes definitions that apply for purposes of the regulationsunder sections 141 through 150 except to the extent otherwise provided.These definitions include: (1) definitions of private activity bond, fixedyield bond, variable yield bond, tender bond, and current index bond; and(2) definitions of sale date, date of issue, and final maturity date.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact Analysis</ITAG>These rules are not major rules as defined in Executive Order 12291.

The Federalincome tax exemption of interest on State and local bonds under section103(a) enables State and local governments to borrow at lower interestrates than taxable issuers. This lower interest rate enables State andlocal governments to finance their governmental activities at significantlyless cost. The lower interest rate also provides the potential to benefitfrom tax arbitrage by investing proceeds of the bonds in taxable investments.The principal purpose of section 148 is to eliminate significant arbitrageincentives to issue more bonds, to issue bonds earlier, and to leave bondsoutstanding longer than necessary to carry out the governmental purposeof the tax-exempt issue. A secondary purpose of section 148 is to minimizethe tax arbitrage benefit associated with investing proceeds of the bondsin taxable investments. Minimizing this tax benefit targets the tax benefitsto the activities for which the tax exemption is provided. If a State orlocal bond is an arbitrage bond (within the meaning of section 148), intereston the bond is not excluded from gross income under section 103(a). Seesection 103(b)(2). (2)<T3> Arbitrage bond defined.</T3> Section 148(a) provides generally thatthe term ``arbitrage bond'' means any bond issued as part of an issue anyportion of the proceeds of which is reasonably expected (at the time ofissuance of the bond) to be used to acquire higher yielding investmentsor to replace funds that were used to acquire such investments. In addition,a bond is treated as an arbitrage bond if the issuer at any time intentionallyuses any portion of the proceeds of the issue in such manner. Section 148(b)provides generally that the term ``higher yielding investments'' meansinvestments (other than certain tax-exempt bonds) that produce a yieldover the term of the issue that is materially higher than the yield onthe issue. Section 148 (c), (d), and (e) provide exceptions for proceedsinvested for a reasonable temporary period, as part of a reasonably requiredreserve or replacement fund, and as part of a minor portion. (3)<T3> Required rebate to the United States.</T3> Section 148(f) providesgenerally that a bond that is part of an issue shall be treated as an arbitragebond unless the issuer rebates to the United States arbitrage profits earnedfrom investing in nonpurpose investments. Section 148(f)(6) provides generallythat the term ``nonpurpose investment'' means any investment (other thancertain tax-exempt bonds) that is acquired with gross proceeds of the issue,and that is not acquired in order to carry out the governmental purposeof the issue. Section 148(f)(4) provides exceptions for certain 6-monthtemporary investments and for small issuers with general taxing powers.Section 148(f) does not apply to qualified veterans' mortgage bonds, orto qualified mortgage bonds issued on or before December 3l, 1988. (4)<T3> Reserve or replacement fund financing limitation.</T3> Section 148(d)(2)provides generally that a bond that is part of an issue shall be treatedas an arbitrage bond if the amount of the sale proceeds of the issue thatis part of a reserve or replacement fund exceeds 10 percent of the proceedsof the issue. This limitation restricts overissuance of tax-exempt bondsin order to obtain significant financial advantages through exploitationof the interest rate differential between the tax-exempt issue and a comparabletaxable issue.

See paragraph (d)(4) of this section (Examples (4)-(11)).(C) <T3>Early retirement. </T3>If a variable yield bond is retired before thefinal maturity date, no payment for a guarantee shall be treated as paidwith respect to the bond after the retirement date, and the amount or amountstreated as paid on any day during the 1-year period immediately precedingthe retirement date (without regard to this sentence) shall not be treatedas paid to the extent properly allocable to the period during which thebond is retired. For example, the constant payment amount treated as paidon the first day of the bond year during which the bond is retired is theproduct of the constant payment amount that would be treated as paid ifthe bond were not retired, and the fraction representing the portion ofthe bond year during which the bond is not retired. See paragraph (d)(4)of this section (Examples (6) and (10)). (D) <T3>Conversion to fixed yield bond. </T3>If a fixed yield bond was a variableyield bond, amounts paid for a qualified guarantee with respect to thevariable yield bond shall be treated as paid with respect to the fixedyield bond in the manner provided in this paragraph (b)(13)(ii) for purposesof paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. See paragraph (d)(4) of thissection (Examples (9)-(11)). (iii) <T3>Definitions and special rules. </T3>For purposes of this paragraph(b)(13)_ (A) <T3>Level payment. </T3>A payment for a qualified guarantee of a bond isa level payment if_ (<T3>1</T3>) The payment is one of a series of payments with respect tothe bond; (<T3>2</T3>) Each payment in the series is the same percentage of the outstandingamount of the bond plus accrued interest for a period of no longer thanone year, determined as of the date the payment is calculated; (<T3>3</T3>) Each payment in the series is due no earlier than one yearbefore and no later than one year after the date the payment is calculated;and (<T3>4</T3>) The series of payments are due at periodic intervals (properlyadjusted to take into account any short interval) and at least one paymentis due each bond year while the guarantee of the bond is in effect.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The accrued interest referred to in paragraph (b)(13)(iii)(A)(<T3>2</T3>) may be based on a hypothetical interest rate (but not at arate above a reasonable maximum rate) if the method of calculating suchinterest does not vary and is not designed to front-load or back-load payments.See paragraph (d)(4) of this section (Examples (4) and (7)). (B) <T3>Nonlevel payment. </T3>Any payment for a qualified guarantee of a bondthat is not a level payment is a nonlevel payment. (C) <T3>Constant payment amount. </T3>The constant payment amount, with respectto a variable yield bond, is equal to the present value of all the nonlevelpayments for a qualified guarantee allocated to the bond, divided by thepresent value of all the nominal amounts paid on the first day of eachbond year while the guarantee of the bond is in effect (without regardto any retirement of the bond before the final maturity date). The nominalamount paid on the first day of each bond year (other than a short bondyear) is $1. The nominal amount paid on the first day of a short bond yearis the product of $1, and the fraction of a full year represented by theshort bond year. Present value is computed as of the first day the guaranteeis in effect by using as the discount rate the composite yield on all thevariable yield bonds to which the nonlevel payments relate (determinedwith regard to level payments but without regard to any nonlevel paymentand by applying rules similar to the rules in paragraph (d) of this section)during the period beginning on the first day the guarantee is in effectand ending on the last day of the first yield period that is at least onefull year during which the guarantee is in effect (not taking into accountany period after which the guarantee is no longer in effect). For purposesof the preceding sentence, the yield period for a fixed yield issue shallbe the period determined under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.See paragraph (d)(4) of this section (Examples (4)-(11)). (D) <T3>Bond year. </T3>The first bond year shall be treated as beginning onthe first day the guarantee of the bond is in effect, and the last bondyear shall be treated as ending on the last day the guarantee of the bondis in effect (without regard to any retirement of the bond before the finalmaturity date). Any bond year that is less than 12 full months is a shortbond year. (E) <T3>Aggregation rule. </T3>All guarantees with respect to variable yieldbonds that are part of the same issue and are entered into with the sameguarantor (or a related person within the meaning of section 144(a)(3))on or before the first computation date shall be treated as one guarantee.The preceding sentence shall not apply to guarantees that are not in effectand are not entered into within one year of each other.

The aggregate principal amount andissue price of the bonds (determined under andSection; 1.148-8T(c)) is $25million, and the final maturity date of the bonds is September 1, 1998.Interest on the bonds is payable on September 1 of each year. The bondholdersare entitled to tender the bonds at par (plus accrued interest if the tenderdate is not an interest payment date) to an independent remarketing agenton March 1 and September 1 of each year. On February 20 and August 20 ofeach year, the remarketing agent determines the lowest interest rate onthe bonds that would enable the bonds that will be tendered on the nexttender date to be remarketed on such date at par (plus any accrued interest).Under the terms of the bonds, this interest rate will be the interest ratefor the next 6-month period beginning on the tender date (unless such rateexceeds 12 percent, which is the maximum interest rate payable on the bonds).Interest is compounded on each tender date. The remarketing agent is requiredto use best efforts to remarket tendered bonds at par (plus any accruedinterest) on each tender date and, if any tendered bonds cannot be remarketedon such date, to continue to use best efforts to remarket the bonds. Thetender price of tendered bonds is to be paid with proceeds received fromremarketing the bonds. If the remarketing proceeds (and other availablefunds) are insufficient to make full payment, the remarketing agent isrequired to draw on an irrevocable letter of credit issued by Bank A tothe extent necessary to make full payment. The letter of credit also guaranteesregular payments of principal and interest on the bonds. Any bond thatcannot be remarketed on a tender date is delivered to Bank A as securityfor  repayment of the letter of credit advance. Advances under the letterof credit bear interest at the maximum interest rate payable on the bonds(compounded semiannually and payable each September 1). Any interest dueon the bonds held by Bank A is paid to Bank A and credited against theinterest accruing on the letter of credit advance. Bank A is entitled toreimbursement for any advances under the letter of credit and interestthereon from proceeds of any subsequent remarketing of the bonds deliveredto Bank A (and from other available funds). The term of the letter of creditends on the final maturity date of the bonds. The initial fee for providingthe letter of credit is $35,000 payable on the date of issue. Annual feesfor providing the letter of credit are payable in advance on the date ofissue and on each September 1 thereafter in an amount equal to one-halfof one percent of the sum of the outstanding par amount of the bonds onsuch date and simple interest for one year at the maximum interest rate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Assume that the letter of credit is a qualified guarantee, thatall bonds tendered on each tender date are remarketed at par (plus anyaccrued interest) on the same date, and that no draws are made under theletter of credit.

(4) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the application ofthis paragraph (c):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>(i) In June 1989 City E issues a refunding issuethe proceeds of which are to be used (together with other available funds)to defease all the outstanding bonds that are part of a refunded issue.The other available funds to be used to defease the outstanding bonds areproceeds of the refunded issue that were in a reasonably required reservefund for the refunded issue, gross proceeds of the refunded issue thatwere in a bona fide debt service fund for the refunded issue, and otheravailable funds that were not gross proceeds of the refunded issue beforethe date of issue of the refunding issue. A portion of the investmentsacquired with the proceeds of the refunding issue and the other availablefunds are tax-exempt investments. All of the investments allocated to theproceeds of the refunding issue that are to be used to defease the outstandingbonds are in the same advance refunding escrow. All of the investmentsallocated to the other available funds are in the same excess proceedsescrow. See paragraph (c)(3) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The terms of the outstanding bonds provide that the 9 percentinterest rate otherwise payable on any bond that is defeased is reducedby one percent per annum. All of the reduced payments of interest resultingfrom the defeasance of the outstanding bonds are interest savings describedin paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. Since the interest savingsare directly attributable to the investments in the escrows, the savingsare treated as imputed receipts with respect to the investments for purposesof andSection; 1.148-2T. The allocation rules in andSection; 1.148-4T(e)(1)apply for purposes of determining the portion of the interest savings thatare allocated to each investment. The reduction in the 9 percent interestrate on the outstanding bonds is not taken into account in computing theyield on the outstanding bonds (or the issue of which such bonds are apart) under andSection; 1.148-3T. See paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>The facts are the same as in Example (1), exceptthat (instead of a one percent reduction in payments of interest on theoutstanding bonds), the defeasance results in a one percent reduction inpayments for a guarantee with respect to the outstanding bonds. The outstandingbonds were secured by a letter of credit. The letter of credit is not aqualified guarantee (within the meaning of andSection; 1.148-3T(b)(12)).The annual letter of credit fee payable each year is equal to one percentof the outstanding principal amount of the bonds. The terms of the outstandingbonds provide that the letter of credit is not required to secure bondsthat have been defeased. As a result of the defeasance, City E is no longerrequired to pay the annual letter of credit fees. Assume that City E willpay identical annual letter of credit fees for a letter of credit to securethe refunding issue, and that this letter of credit is a qualified guarantee(within the meaning of andSection; 1.148-3T(b)(12)). The reductions in thepayments for the letter of credit fees with respect to the outstandingbonds are interest savings described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of thissection that are directly attributable to the investments in the escrows.These interest savings are treated as imputed receipts with respect tothe escrow investments. The interest savings would not be treated as imputedreceipts if the letter of credit securing the refunding issue was not aqualified guarantee (within the meaning of andSection; 1.148-3T(b)(12)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>The facts are the same as in Example (2), exceptthat the entire letter of credit fee was prepaid on the date of issue ofthe outstanding bonds, and a portion of the prepaid fee is refunded bythe guarantor when the outstanding bonds are defeased. The portion of therefunded fee that is properly allocable to the period that begins on thedate the outstanding bonds are defeased and that ends on the date the outstandingbonds are retired is an interest saving directly attributable to the investmentsin the escrows. The portion of the refunded fee properly allocable to theperiod beginning on the date the outstanding bonds are retired and endingon the final maturity date of the outstanding bonds is not attributableto the investments in the escrows. The constant payment allocation methodis a proper method of allocating the refund for this purpose.

(2) <T3>Bond year. </T3>The term ``bond year'' means, with respect to an issue,each 1-year period (or shorter period from the date of issue) that endsat the close of business on the day in the calendar year that is selectedby the issuer. The day selected by the issuer must be the last day of acompounding interval used in computing the yield on the issue under andSection;1.148-3T. (3) <T3>Discharge. </T3>A bond is discharged on the date all amounts due thereunderare actually and unconditionally due if cash is available at the placeof payment, and no interest accrues with respect to the bond after suchdate.

For example, amounts payable on the first business day of a monthmay be treated as if payable on the first day of the month. (c) <T3>Issue price</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The term ``issue price'' has the meaning given suchterm by sections 1273 and 1274. Thus, if bonds are publicly offered (<T3>i.e.</T3>, sold by the issuer to a bond house, broker, or similar personsacting in the capacity of underwriters or wholesalers) and are not issuedfor property, the issue price of the bonds is determined on the basis ofthe initial offering price to the public at which price a substantial amountof the bonds was sold to the public. Such price shall be determined separatelyfor bonds that are not substantially identical. Such price also shall bedetermined separately for substantially identical bonds that are sold atone price to the general public and to institutional or other investorsat a discount from that price. If a bond is sold to the public after thedate of issue, the price at which the bond is sold must be adjusted toreflect the price at which the bond would have been sold on the date ofissue. This adjustment shall eliminate any change in the fair market valueof the bond after the date of issue (including any change attributableto interest and premium or discount that accrues on the bond after suchdate). If a bond is issued for property, appropriate adjustments shallbe made to the applicable Federal rate to take into account the tax exemptionof the bond in applying section 1274.

See andSection; 1.150-lT(c)(1) for definition of saledate. (ii) <T3>Bonds offered at a discount. </T3>If substantially identical bondsare offered at one price to the general public and at a discount from thatprice to institutional or other investors, the determination as to whichbonds are sold at each price shall be made on the basis of actual factsand reasonable expectations as of the date of issue. See andSection; 1.150-lT(c)(2)for definition of date of issue. (iii) <T3>Bona fide offering required. </T3>Paragraph (c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii)of this section shall not apply to any bond that is not actually offeredto the general public in a bona fide public offering for the issue priceof the bond (determined without regard to this sentence). (iv) <T3>Tender bond remarketing. </T3>For purposes of determining the issueprice of a tender bond under andSection; 1.148-3T(d)(2)(ii)(A) when the bondis remarketed, this paragraph (c) shall be applied by treating the dateon which the interest rate is reset as the sale date and the date on whichthe bond is remarketed as the date of issue. (3) <T3>Fair market value limit. </T3>In no event shall the issue price ofa bond determined under this paragraph (c) exceed the fair market valueof the bond as of the sale date. (4) <T3>Aggregate issue price. </T3>The term ``aggregate issue price'' refersto the sum of the issue prices of the bonds issued as part of the issueas determined under this paragraph (c) (but without regard to any tenderbond remarketing). (d) <T3>Gross proceeds</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The term ``gross proceeds'' means, with respect toan issue, any proceeds of the issue and any funds (other than proceedsof the issue) that are part of a reserve or replacement fund for the issue.(2) <T3>Proceeds. </T3>The term ``proceeds'' means, with respect to an issue,any original proceeds, any discount proceeds, and any transferred proceedsof the issue. (3) <T3>Original proceeds. </T3>The term ``original proceeds'' means, withrespect to an issue, any sale proceeds and any investment proceeds of theissue. Such term shall also include any amount recovered with respect tothe issue under andSection; 1.148-1T(d). Such term shall not include amountsactually or constructively received with respect to a purpose investmentto the extent such amounts are properly allocated to administrative costsrecoverable under andSection; 1.103-13(c)(5) or to the higher yield permittedunder andSection; 1.103-13(b)(5)(i)(A). For purposes of the preceding sentence,a purpose investment that is a tax-exempt bond shall not be treated astax-exempt. (4) <T3>Sale proceeds. </T3>The term ``sale proceeds'' means, with respectto an issue, any amounts actually or constructively received from the sale(or other disposition) of any bond that is part of the issue. (5) <T3>Investment proceeds. </T3>The term ``investment proceeds'' means, withrespect to an issue, any amounts actually or constructively received frominvesting original proceeds of the issue. (6) <T3>Net sale proceeds_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>The term ``net sale proceeds'' means, with respectto an issue, any sale proceeds of the issue (without regard to andSection;1.148-4T(e)(2) and andSection; 1.103-14(e)(2)(ii)) other than_ (A) Sale proceeds that are part of a reasonably required reserve or replacementfund; (B) Sales proceeds used to pay accrued interest included in the issue priceof any bond that is part of the issue no later than the date that is lessthan one year after the date of issue; (C) Sale proceeds used to pay capitalized interest on the issue that accruesno later than the date that is 3 years after the date of issue; and (D) Sale proceeds received with respect to a purpose investment that areallocated to an expenditure no later than 13 months after the date of receiptthereof. (ii) <T3>Capitalized interest. </T3>The term ``capitalized interest'' means,with respect to an issue, interest paid on the sale proceeds of the issuethat have been allocated to an expenditure if_ (A) The expenditure is not for the payment of the principal or intereston or the retirement price of any bond; and (B) The expenditure is of a type that is chargeable to capital accountfor Federal income tax purposes (with or without an election by a taxpayer).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Such term shall also include interest on the sale proceeds of theissue that are allocated to expenditures for the payment of capitalizedinterest on the issue. (iii) <T3>Special rules for refunded and refunding issues. </T3>For purposesof applying any requirement relating to the expenditure of the net saleproceeds of a refunded issue or refunding issue_ (A) Net sale proceeds properly allocated to the refunding portion of anissue shall not be treated as net sale proceeds; (B) Net sale proceeds properly allocated to the refunded portion of anissue shall be treated as net sale proceeds of the refunded issue and ofthe refunding issue; and (C) The requirement shall be treated as met with respect to a refundingissue only if the requirement is met separately with respect to the nonrefundingportion of the issue and each refunding portion of the issue. (7) <T3>Discount proceeds. </T3>[Reserved] (8) <T3>Transferred proceeds. </T3>The term ``transferred proceeds'' means,with respect to a refunding issue, proceeds that have ceased to be proceedsof a refunded issue and are transferred proceeds of the refunding issueby reason of andSection; 1.148-4T(e)(2) (including amounts actually or constructivelyreceived from investing such proceeds). (9) <T3>Indirect use_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Any reference to proceeds shall be construed to includea reference to proceeds used directly or indirectly. Such reference hasthe same meaning as when used in section 148(a). If proceeds are used directlyand indirectly, the proceeds shall be treated as used directly or indirectly(whichever produces the larger amount of rebatable arbitrage). (ii) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the application ofthis paragraph (d)(9):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>The facts are the same as in Example (1) in paragraph(g)(5) of this section, except that $1 million of the proceeds of the 1985issue are not used directly to discharge the 1983 issue. Instead, as partof the very same transaction or a series of closely related and interdependenttransactions, City A deposited this $1 million of proceeds of the 1985issue into its General Fund and transferred approximately the same amountfrom its General Fund to the trustee for the 1983 issue. City A had beenadvised by its tax counsel that this substitution of fully fungible dollarswould result in greater debt service savings from the refunding. A nonpurposeinvestment is in an advance refunding escrow if the investment is allocatedto proceeds to which andSection; 1.103-13(b)(5)(iii) applies. See paragraph(g)(2)(i) of this section. Section 1.103-13(b)(5)(iii) applies to proceedsused directly or indirectly to discharge the 1983 issue. See andSection;1.103-13(b)(1) and (f)(4)(ii). City A used proceeds of the 1985 issue indirectlyto discharge the 1983 issue and to purchase the investments purchased directlywith the money transferred from the General Fund.

A portion of the proceeds of the 1983 issue (including investmentproceeds) are to be used to discharge the prior issues in 1995. Prior tothe discharge date, such proceeds will be held by the respective trusteesfor the two prior issues. All nonpurpose investments allocated to suchproceeds are and will continue to be (until the 1995 discharge date) inthe same advance refunding escrow (the ``1983 advance refunding escrow'').See paragraph (g)(2) and (g)(4) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) In 1985, City A issues an issue (the ``1985 issue'') to refunda portion of the 1983 issue. Proceeds of the 1985 issue (including investmentproceeds) are to be used to discharge interest on the 1983 issue, to dischargeprincipal of and call premium on the 1983 issue in 1990, and to fund areasonably required reserve fund for the 1985 issue. Amounts that werein a bona fide debt service fund for the 1983 issue also will be used todischarge principal of the 1983 issue in 1990. The proceeds of the 1985issue and amounts that were in the bona fide debt service fund for the1983 issue that are to be used to discharge the 1983 issue will be heldby the trustee for the 1983 issue, and the proceeds of the 1985 issue inthe reserve fund will be held by the trustee for the 1985 issue. All nonpurposeinvestments allocated to these proceeds of the 1985 issue are and willcontinue to be (until the 1990 discharge date) in the same advance refundingescrow (the ``1985 advance refunding escrow''). See paragraph (g)(2) and(g)(4) of this section. The proceeds in the 1985 advance refunding escroware not (and never will be) in the same advance refunding escrow as theproceeds in the 1983 advance refunding escrow. See paragraph (g)(4) ofthis section. Investments allocated to amounts that were in the bona fidedebt service fund for the 1983 issue are not in a restricted escrow.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) A transfer occurs in 1990 when a portion of the 1983 issue isdischarged with proceeds of the 1985 issue. To the extent of this transfer,a ratable portion of the proceeds (and investments and expenditures) ofthe 1983 issue cease to be treated as proceeds (and investments and expenditures)of the 1983 issue and become transferred proceeds (and transferred investmentsand expenditures) of the 1985 issue. See andSection; 1.148-4T(e)(2)(iii)(A).The nonpurpose receipt with respect to the 1983 issue and the nonpurposepayment with respect to the 1985 issue that arise by reason of this transferequal the present value of the transferred investments at the time of thetransfer. See andSection; 1.148-2T(b)(2)(ii), (b)(3)(ii), and (d)(3)(i)(B).The discount rate used in computing this present value is the yield onall nonpurpose investments (including the transferred investments) in the1983 advance refunding escrow. That yield is not affected by this (or anyother) transfer.
