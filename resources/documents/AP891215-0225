Reps. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, andHenry Waxman, D-Calif., on Thursday asked the General AccountingOffice to investigate a policy adopted in 1987 after a report fromthe Public Health Service showed sex discrimination at NIH clinicaltests.   ``The gender bias in medical research isn't confined to the lab;it filters down to the health care that women receive,'' saidSchroeder.   ``If a woman wants to know if she should take an aspirin everyother day to help prevent heart disease or take acholesterol-lowering drug to bring down her cholesterol level, herdoctor won't have the answer. All of the research in this area hasbeen done on men,'' said the congresswoman.</TEXT><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Younger people with limited educations are morelikely than anyone to light up and should be the target ofcampaigns against cigarettes, a study released by the federalCenters for Disease Control concluded.   A 1988 survey of about 20,000 people in 36 states and theDistrict of Columbia found that less-educated people, who also tendto be of a lower social and economic status, are more likely to besmokers.   ``There has been progress in reducing cigarette smoking. But thestudy shows most of the progress is limited to the well-educated,''said Dr. Luis Escobedo of the Atlanta-based CDC, who analyzedaspects of the survey released Thursday.   ``The emphasis must become more targeted,'' he said. ``Some ofthat already is being done through substance abuse programs.Tobacco is an addictive substance.''</TEXT></DOC>
