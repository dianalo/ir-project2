In Italy the development of this alternativeenergy source, as well as the other ones, is committed to ENEA, the ItalianNational Commission for Nuclear and Alternative Energy Sources. An overviewis reported of the national activity in this field. The strategic linesfor the near future are also prospected. The research and developmentactivity is conducted both in ENEA and in public and private researchcentres. The programmes are supported by ENEA, directly and in conjuctionwith the National Research Council (CNR). In the short-medium term crystallinesilicon solar cells and modules are studied in close connection withthe three national industries. In the medium-long term the main effortis devoted to thin film solar cells with particular stress on amorphoussilicon an gallium arsenide. 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
