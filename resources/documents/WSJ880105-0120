Pearl said FAI notified it of the stake after purchasing 750,000 Pearl shares last Tuesday, boosting its holding above 5%. London's stock exchange requires a company to declare holdings of 5% or more in any British listed company.    Mr. Adler didn't indicate if he intended to launch a full bid for Pearl. &quot;We look forward to a happy and prosperous association&quot; with Pearl, he said.    Analysts were unsure whether the stake would lead to a full offer. Pearl has attracted bid speculation for a number of years, and the FAI stake represents &quot;the first time anyone looking remotely like a bidder&quot; has emerged, said Michael Hesketh, an analyst at the British brokerage Warburg Securities.    Last summer, FAI built up a 14.7% stake in the United Kingdom merchant bank Hill Samuel Group PLC. FAI later sold the stake to TSB Group PLC, which bought Hill Samuel in November for #777 million ($1.46 billion).    Pearl shares rose 15 pence (28 cents), to 469 pence, in late London trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
