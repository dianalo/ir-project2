After trading as high as $3.92 an ounce during the day,silver for March delivery ended at $3.833, up eight cents.</LP><TEXT>   The news caught traders by surprise, triggering buying bymany who had sold short in anticipation of further pricedeclines, said Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at ChaseManhattan Bank.   Details were too sketchy to determine what effect thestrike would have on silver supplies, he said. A workstoppage can be expected to buoy prices, Mr. Mehta said, butif prices rise above $4, stockpiles will probably be tappedto make up for any loss of production from Mexico.   Yesterday, prices ran up sharply and then fell abruptly, apattern that William O'Neill, futures strategist at MerrillLynch, said is typical for silver. The climb was enhanced bytechnical factors as the price topped $3.90, but then theadvance simply ran out of steam, he said.   The pull-back from the highs also reflected the fact thatthere is still plenty of silver around, even with the mineshut down, said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst atPaineWebber.   &quot;Silver is the most emotional and least useful of all themetals,&quot; said Mr. Mehta. &quot;This is really why it's used byspeculators the way it is. It's prone to exaggerated moves.&quot;   More significant to the silver market is Peru's social,economic and political deterioration, Mr. Savaiko said. Peruis the largest producer of silver, and at some point itsproblems could get severe enough to cause a major supplydisruption, he said.   &quot;If the market can react to these vague reports about astrike in Mexico, it definitely should be concerned aboutreal ongoing economic and political problems in Peru,&quot; Mr.Savaiko said.   However, supply is only half the reason for silver's lowprice, he said. Even if its price fell to zero, silver wouldstill be produced as a byproduct of base-metal and goldmining, he said; the other half of the problem is simple lackof demand.   One factor that could restore some investor interest inthe metal would be a return of high inflation, Mr. Savaikosaid. Although price deflation is the dominant theme incommodity markets now, the specter of inflation could returnto U.S. markets if federal spending continues to grow and theFederal Reserve increases the money supply as expected.   Silver and gold would benefit as hedges against highinflation, but because of its lower cost, silver would bemore affordable for small investors, Mr. Savaiko said.   However, Ian MacDonald, vice president, precious metals,at Credit Suisse in New York, called silver currently &quot;adisaster story.&quot; There are record amounts of silver in themarket but no new demand, he said. The industry needs to findways to stimulate demand, perhaps in jewelry, he said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork futures prices went on aroller-coaster ride as traders positioned themselves for thelong holiday weekend. Early in the session, rampant sellingof pork belly futures contracts forced some large funds outof the market. Afterward, traders sensing that prices hadoverreacted downward began buying, pushing the prices backup. The pork belly contract for March settled at 64.35 centsa pound, up 1.07 cents. Cash hog prices were stronger thanexpected in the eastern Corn Belt, and slaughter of hogs hasdeclined somewhat. Both of these factors exerted upwardpressure on pork belly and hog futures prices, said JerryAbbenhaus, analyst for A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc., St. Louis.The live hog contract for April rose 0.4 cent to 49.4 cents apound. The combination of the holiday weekend, acattle-on-feed report due out Tuesday and the expirationThursday of February futures contracts is expected to keepprices choppy for a few days, Mr. Abbenhaus said.                                                                                                          ENERGY: Oil prices fell, with heating oil leading thedecline. Heating oil prices had been strong of late becauseabnormally cold weather in Europe boosted demand for the U.S.product. But a perception this week that the cold weatherthere is nearing its end put a stop to much of the exporting.As interest in heating oil declined, participants returned tothe waiting game that has characterized the market throughmuch of the Middle East war. With the focus once again on theuncertainty of war, and in an absence of any other news,participants avoided taking aggressive new positions. Traderssaid the market won't react appreciably to anything but majorwar news.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices rose. Sugar for March deliveryfinished 0.22 cent a pound higher at 8.5 cents. Thestatistical firm F.O. Licht estimated the crop for the 199091season ending in August at 112.8 million tons, or 3.3 milliontons more than anticipated demand. But this bearish estimatehad been expected for several days, so the price alreadyreflected it, said Harri Schwartz, an analyst at CargillInvestor Services. Judith Ganes, an analyst with MerrillLynch, added that white sugar prices have been firm recentlyon buying by Middle East countries ahead of a religiousholiday in mid-March. The strength in the white sugar markethas been lending support to raw sugar prices, preventing themfrom falling further, she said. Also contributing to the risewere concerns about a slightly smaller crop in Thailand,which will reduce near-term supplies. For the year, though,supplies are plentiful, she added.</TEXT></DOC>
