Kennedy International Airport was the scene of emotionalreunions Thursday as the Soviet refugees _ including 1,350 Jews and250 Pentecostal and Evangelical Christians _ arrived to takeadvantage of a processing policy that ends at midnight tonight.   The agencies that assist Jewish refugees decided to stop theflow early out of respect for Rosh Hashanah, which begins atsundown tonight and ends Sunday.   ``Rosh Hashanah represents a new beginning for every Jew, butexpecially for these people,'' said Karl Zukerman, executivedirector of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, who spent most of theday greeting the new arrivals.   ``I dreamed of this day for a long time,'' said Zena Gadelova,as she embraced her four younger brothers, whom she hadn't seen infive years. They arrived with 17 other relatives, including wives,children and in-laws.   New U.S. policies will mean longer waits for Soviet emigrants ata time when the Soviet Union is allowing record numbers to leave.Last year, 18,965 Jews emigrated, up from 8,155 in 1987. This yearthat number is expected to near 50,000.   Instead of being processed in Europe, as in the past, therefugees' paperwork will be handled at the American Embassy inMoscow, the same as other would-be emigrants.   Many of the arriving refugees Thursday had been among 14,000Soviet Jews waiting in Rome for final processing. It was thelargest number of Jewish immigrants to arrive in the United Stateson a single day since the end of World War II.   Mikhail Sukhar of Moscow said he had given up hope of gettingout of Rome before the deadline after his first application toenter the United States was denied. ``I didn't even reapply, butthey said I could go.''   U.S. officials have said they will continue to review theapplications of Soviet refugees already waiting in Rome and Vienna.   Since the early 1970s, both Jews and Christians who wanted toleave Moscow applied for Israeli visas at the Dutch Embassy, whichperformed consular functions for Israel in Moscow.   They would then proceed to Vienna or Rome, where as many as 90percent of the Soviet Jews expressed a desire to go to the UnitedStates. Their applications almost automatically were approved byU.S. immigration officials.   The Israeli government has asked the United States to change thepolicy in the hope of attracting more Soviet Jews to settle inIsrael, but State Department officials deny the policy change wasat Israel's behest.</TEXT></DOC>
