Express and the Dallas Magic '73, champions ofthe East and Southwest regions, respectively. They meet at 3 p.m. Friday.;   The Athena Cup final is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Sunday, following thethird-place match.;    WVSC's goal is to duplicate the feat of the 1983Saratoga Spirit, the only other team from the Western Region to win the AthenaCup since the competition's inception in 1980.;    Sandra Asimos, a forward onthat Saratoga team who went on to be All-America at Westmont College and amember of the women's national team, said she believes WVSC has the talent towin in Omaha.;    &quot;I'm familiar with most of the West Valley players -- Iworked with 10 of them two of the last three years as an assistant coach ofthe Northern California team in the Olympic Developmental program,&quot; Asimossaid.;    &quot;When you have a team with four players with national-teamexperience on the youth and senior levels (Venturini, Sanchez, Rafanelli andJennifer Gardiner), and others who have played on the state and regionallevels, it's going to be tough for anyone to beat them.&quot;;    Asimos said thisyear's West Valley team appears better than the '83 Saratoga Spirit.;    &quot;Isay that only because of how rapidly women's soccer has developed since 1983,&quot;Asimos said. &quot;West Valley has several strong, developed and skillful playerswho have had more experience at a higher competitive level than we did when wewent to the finals.&quot;;    WVSC has three starters who played as freshmen incollege last fall -- Gardiner and Rafanelli from Stanford and Dawn McDonaldfrom Foothill College. Gardiner, a midfielder, was a Mercury News All-SantaClara County first-team choice in 1990 as a senior at Branham. Rafanelli, aforward, is from Piedmont, and McDonald, a goalkeeper, played her high schoolsoccer at Oak Grove.;    Six starters, including midfielders Sanchez andVenturini, graduated from high school in June and are planning to play collegesoccer this fall.;    Sanchez and Venturini, two of the top high-school soccerrecruits in the nation this year, have accepted full athletic scholarships toNorth Carolina. The Tar Heels, coached by women's national-team coach AnsonDorrance, have won eight of the last nine NCAA titles and are favored to winagain this year.;    Sanchez, the 1991 Mercury News Santa Clara County highschool player of the year and a first-team all-county choice the last threeseasons, will be making her first trip to the youth national finals. She is sointent on winning a national youth club title in Omaha this weekend that shepassed up a chance to travel to China with the women's national team.;   &quot;Missing the trip to China is a bummer,&quot; said Sanchez, who also was anoutstanding track and field athlete at Santa Teresa. &quot;But this may be the onlytime I'm going to get the chance to play on an Athena Cup championship team.;   &quot;I think we have a good chance of winning the title. We have someoutstanding players, and I think this is the hardest working team I've beenon.&quot;;    Sanchez, who played for the women's national team in tournaments inBulgaria and Haiti in April, is expected to be chosen by Dorrance to play forthe national team at the first women's World Cup in China in November.;    Twoof WVSC's starters will be high-school seniors in 1991-'92 -- HeidiGriesshaber at Leigh and defender Angie Burch at Prospect.;    Startingsweeper Maily Smitt, a '91 graduate of Westmont and one of three WVSC playersplanning to play this fall at SCU, is approaching the nationals with cautiousoptimism.;    &quot;On paper, this team is probably the best,&quot; she said during arecent training session at Lincoln High in San Jose. &quot;But we're going to haveto prove it on the field.&quot;;    Alex Crozier, in his second year as the WVSCcoach, doesn't believe his team will be overconfident in Omaha.;    &quot;And it'snot a team where two or three players take control. In the state and regionaltournaments, everyone on our (17-player) roster made a contribution in one ormore of our wins.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVE PAYNE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910724  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  933  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 24, 199100206228,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
