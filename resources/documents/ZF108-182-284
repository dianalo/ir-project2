explains Mitchell, the bank's director of human resources.andP;  &quot;If wecould trim a small percentage of those expenses, even 1%, that's $1 million.andO;The system would have paid for itself.&quot;andM;Jerry Fultz, manager of employee relations at Phillips Petroleum Co., aBartlesville, Okla., oil company hard hit by two separate hostile takeoverbids three years ago, says its homegrown human resource system has become acritical part of the company's strategic planning on the road back tofinancial recovery.andM;&quot;As we restructured the company, we put in place early retirement plans,flexible benefits packages, and other packages that helped smooth thedownsizing of our company and retain our best employees,&quot; Fultz says.andP;  &quot;Wemade sure that human resource considerations were up-front in our corporateplanning.&quot;andM;Mitchell and Fultz represent the kind of thinking that is reshaping thecorporate perception of human resources.andP;  This is especially true in largecorporations where the managing of human resources is becoming a criticalfactor in corporate performance.andM;According to those who work in the human resource business, this change ofcorporate perception of human resources follows some fundamental changes inU.S.andP;  industries during the 1980s and into the 1990s.andM;&quot;The U.S.andP;  continues to become less of a manufacturing economy and more of aservice economy,&quot; explains Larry Munini, president of Genesys SoftwareSystems, Inc., a Methuen, Mass., vendor of human resource systems.andM;&quot;A service economy means an emphasis on people and it means morepeople-related expenses,&quot; Munini says.andM;&quot;In more service-oriented industries, such as industry and finance, costs aregreater,&quot; he claims.andP;  &quot;Our clients are adding up all the monies on salaries,benefits, training, vacations, and so on, and they see those costsescalating.andP;  If you can control and cut a fraction of those costs, you'retalking about big savings.&quot;andM;MARKETING, ECONOMIC CHANGESandM;In the background are changes in the economic and marketing areas of U.S.andO;business.andP;  Increased competition and belt tightening have led toacquisitions, mergers, and management layoffs at many companies.andO;Corporations are restructuring their management, and they are planningdifferent product and marketing strategies.andM;Remaining managers find themselves with more decision-makingresponsibilities, more authority, and more direct impact on corporate policymaking.andP;  Corporations have more riding on their employees than ever before.andM;Ron Groess, president of the Human Resource Systems Professionalsorganization and flexible benefits project manager at 3M Corp. inMinneapolis, says that during the past five years human resources has becomemore of an information retrieval function rather than a record-keepingfunction.andM;TAKING A PROACTIVE ROLEandM;Implicit in this change, Groess says, is a tendency for corporations toregard HR as more proactive and strategically important.andM;&quot;Human resource management systems and personnel are now dealing more withemployee solutions,&quot; explains Michael Blair, president of Cyborg Systems,Inc., Chicago.andM;&quot;Human resource managers now find themselves involved in a whole spectrum ofsuccession planning.andP;  How does a company plan for new employees to replaceretiring people; how can a company analyze the costs of employee recruitmentand replacement; how can they provide the best benefits packages to lure andretain good employees; and how can we fit all of these considerations intobroader corporate strategic planning?&quot;andP;  Blair said.andM;A well-run human resource operation can even make a corporation morecompetitive, Blair claims.andM;&quot;If it impacts the bottom line,&quot; he says, &quot;you can be sure it's beingappreciated by CEOs.&quot;andM;Human resource managers are demanding more from HRMS vendors.andP;  InternationalMultifoods Corp., a Minneapolis-based food catering firm, has decided toreplace what it terms an &quot;inflexible&quot; human resource system with somethingthat could work more in line with corporate human resource goals.andM;Diane Dougherty, a business analyst at the company, explains that the oldBurroughs-based HR system was essentially two separate systems, payroll andbenefits, which could not communicate with each other and were not online.andM;&quot;Our critical success factors showed us that what we needed was a system thatwe could program, expand to include data from other departments, and that wecould tie in more directly with our employees, giving them the ability tocall up payroll information from their own screens.andP;  We felt that HR had tobe more progressive,&quot; Dougherty said.andM;TIE IN TO MANAGEMENTandM;Mitchell, who recently left Swiss Bank to start Phoenix Enterprises, Inc., aNew York-based human resource and management consulting firm, said Swiss Bankworked to tie human resources directly with top decision makers.andM;&quot;The real benefit in spending money on human resource systems is todistribute information in an integrated fashion with existing financialapplications, and put it all into the hands of executives and employees,&quot;Mitchell says.andM;&quot;Executives could use the data for headcounts and integrating profit-and-lossinformation.andP;  With that kind of data, you can control what's happening in acompany on a day-to-day basis,&quot; he said.andM;These changes are in turn leading to changes in the makeup of key softwareapplications that comprise current human resource management systems.andM;&quot;The [software] modules that used to be considered most important in humanresources mainly dealt with government regulations,&quot; explains Blair.andP;  &quot;Thatwas really a reporting function.andP;  Now the emphasis is on modules that canhandle applicant tracking and position control, manpower and successionplanning, and the benefits area.&quot;andM;Good benefits packages serve a double purpose: flex or cafeteria-stylebenefit plans, for example, have become an important selling point to attractand retain employees and a way for corporations to offset spiraling healthinsurance costs.andM;Flex benefit plans offer employees a menu of choices to direct their paymentstoward certain coverage options, such as child care benefits and varioushealth maintenance organization options.andM;Human resource management software now offer employers the ability to scanvarious benefit programs and options in the marketplace, and conduct&quot;what-if&quot; queries as to which programs would fit employers' needs.andM;The move toward a service economy and an emphasis on managing personnel hascreated more demand from employees for expanding benefits and benefitsoptions.andM;Susan Luther, director of strategic marketing for McCormack andamp; Dodge ofNatick, Mass., says that human resources must place more emphasis onexpanding benefits packages to include flexible benefits, child care, andeven elderly care considerations.andM;&quot;Human resource software has to be able to provide solutions to all these newconcerns,&quot; Luther says.andM;EXPANDING THE REACH OF HRMSandM;Relational database systems, especially IBM's DB2, are redefining the levelsand flexibility with which human resource data can be analyzed and moved fromvarious corporate departments.andM;Technologies such as cooperative processing between mainframes andmicrocomputers, client-server database models, the advent of powerful,networked workstations, and graphical user interfaces, such as MicrosoftWindows and IBM's Presentation Manager, are expanding the reach and abilityof human resource systems.andM;Most HRMS vendors provide networking capabilities flexible enough to providefor mainframe- or micro-based HRMS configurations to fit decentralized orcentralized information technology environments of clients.andM;For example, National Oilwell, a Houston oil company, has run a rollercoaster ride in the past several years, moving from a centralized ISoperation to decentralized, and then back to a centralized operation.andP;  Thesechanges, according to Lucy Price, payroll manager at National Oilwell,paralleled the fortunes and misfortunes of the volatile petroleum industrythrough the '80s.andM;Price says that in 1981 when the oil slump hit, National Oilwell, then calledArmco National Oilwell, began cutting employees through layoffs and earlyretirement programs.andP;  The staff was reduced from 10,000 to its present numberof 2,000.andM;&quot;The human resource operations were a mess,&quot; Price says.andP;  &quot;Every new guy incharge of human resources wanted the [HRMS] system changed.andP;  We were using a20-year-old Cobol-based human resource system that was built in-house.andP;  Thatsystem just couldn't keep up with all the changes at the company.andM;DIFFERENT SOLUTIONSandM;The company went outside and contracted with Genesys to install a packaged,mainframe-based human resource system.andM;In 1987 the company merged with USX Oilwell Supply lto form National Oilwell,and the merger produced more pressure on human resources to handle severancepayments, tax forms, and other employment considerations.andP;  The new humanresource system handled the task, Price says.andM;While National Oilwell stabilizes around its mainframe-based system, thePioneer Bank of Chattanooga, Tenn., opted for a distributedmicrocomputer-based system from Comshare, Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.andM;Don Griffin, personnel officer at the bank, says his human resourcesoperation uses Profiles/PC running on IBM PCs to download and upload employeerecord-keeping data to the bank's mainframe.andM;With 250 bank employees, Griffin says Pioneer Bank does not yet need some ofthe human resource software modules Comshare offers.andM;&quot;What we have now,&quot; Griffin says, &quot;is a quantum leap above the IBMDisplaywriter we used for human resources before.andP;  An insurance billingreport that used to take two hours now only takes 10 minutes.&quot;andM;SAA AND COOPERATIVE PROCESSINGandM;A major movement rippling through the HRMS industry is the advent of IBM'sSystems Application Architecture.andP;  SAA is IBM's holy grail of &quot;open systems&quot;within the multitiered and generally incompatible world of IBM systemsarchitectures.andP;  SAA will supply common user access, common programminginterfaces, and common communications support across most IBM systemsarchitectures.andM;&quot;SAA will enable users to very visually walk through a person's humanresource file,&quot; says John Tibbetts, president of Kinexis, a San Franciscoconsulting firm that deals with SAA product development.andP;  &quot;A user sittingdown in front of an application that is running on multiple processors shoudlbe presented with a single uniform look to that application,&quot; he says.andM;SAA provides for different functions of the same application to run ondifferent machines, and that constitutes cooperative processing.andM;One vendor delivering on the promise of cooperative processing is PeopleSoftof Walnut Creek, Calif.andP;  Founded in 1987 by Dave Duffield, who also foundedIntegral Systems of Walnut Creek, the firm built its product line on theclient-server database model to work with DB2 and SQL, as well asPresentation Manager for OS/2 and Windows for MS-DOS.andM;Among PeopleSoft's clients are Eastman Kodak, Marriott Corp., and SybaseInc., the Emeryville, Calif.-based supplier of SQL Server.andP;  The PeopleSoftproduct can be configured on a standalone PC, local area network, and/or amainframe.andM;Tibbetts provides the following example of a typical human resourceapplication running over SAA:andM;&quot;The human resource application runs on a mainframe and stores its data inDB2.andP;  The mainframe performs integrity checks and database validation.andP;  Whena user wishes to view some of the human resource data, however, that data canbe sent down to an IBM PS/2, for example, and accessed through iconic'folders' and displayed as 'cards' in a high-speed cardfile.&quot;andM;Many HRMS vendors are at various stages of developing SAA-compliant humanresource systems.andP;  More user corporations, especially the larger ones, areincreasingly placing SAA requirements in requests.andM;&quot;Human resources tends to develop large database, which lends itself tocooperative processing,&quot; according to Dianne Baron, manager of SoftwareVendor SAA Programs at IBM.andM;&quot;But there was a whole suite of non-human resource applications and vendorsintroduced at the OfficeVision announcement,&quot; she added.andM;Not all corporate human resource operations are interested in SAA complianceat this juncture, however.andM;Linda Clickner, personnel information manager at The Nature Conservancy, anon-profit organization based in Arlington, Va., which employs 1,100 people,says SAA would be overkill for their relatively small needs.andM;Price at National Oilwell also expresses little interest in SAA.andM;But both Fultz at Phillips and Mitchell at Swiss Bank say they are ready andable to use the integration and benefits of SAA.andM;&quot;Remember,&quot; Mitchell advises, &quot;SAA also makes you less reliant on a singlehuman resource vendor.andP;  Our MIS people like that.&quot;andM;Human resource managers are not the only people that can profit from SAA.andO;Norm Neuman, vice president of marketing at Comshare, says thestandardization of interfaces and communications within SAA also benefitsoftware developers.andM;&quot;SAA means standards, and that means fewer programming and trainingproblems,&quot; Neuman says.andM;Kolodziej is a freelance writer based in Lexington, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
