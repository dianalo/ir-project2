At least four peoplewere reported killed in the uprising.   The army said in a communique that the 500 insurgents who hadbeen holed up at a military base just outside the capital agreed togive up their weapons and explosives.   But the government news agency Telam reported that some rebelsstill had refused to surrender at the base, and that some rebelsstill laid siege to another military installation at Mercedes, 60miles west of Buenos Aires.   At least three civilians and one policeman were killed and 35people wounded during a clash Sunday between hundreds of anti-rebeldemonstrators and the insurgents, Radio Rivadavia reported Sunday.   President Raul Alfonsin _ facing the worst threat since hiscivilian government replaced military rule in 1983 _ denied that anydeals were made with the rebels.   The rebels had demanded an overhaul in the military hierarchy, abigger military budget, and an end to prosecutions for human rightsabuses committed during the 1976-83 military dictatorships.   ``This has been a really important success,'' Alfonsin toldreporters at Government House. ``There were no concessions of anykind.   But a spokesman for the opposition Peronist Party requested adetailed briefing by Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena about howthe settlement was achieved.   Earlier, the private Noticias Argentinas and Diarios y Noticiasnews agencies said army chief Lt. Gen. Jose Dante Caridi had agreedto a rebel demand that he resign. Both agencies cited political andmilitary sources.   ``The government did not negotiate on an amnesty, changes of(human rights) trials or any claim by anyone,'' Sen. AntonioBerhongaray, chairman of the Defense Committee, said.   ``Democracy Triumphed,'' said a message flashed across the screenby the five TV stations that had been broadcasting simultaneous newsof the revolt for nearly 24 hours.   The rebel leader, Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, was arrested, andthe approximately 500 rebels he commanded began to lay down theirweapons, the army said.   Soldiers immediately began to remove mines and fill in trenchesmade by the rebels to defend their positions at the seized VillaMartelli base on the outskirts of the city.   Alfonsin had wide support to quell the rebellion and pledged to``suffocate'' it. But government troops repeatedly refused to attackor restrict the rebels' movements.   One government military officer, Gen. Adolfo Patricio Etcheun,said he and his men agreed with Seineldin's demands and would nottake up arms against the rebels. Etcheun commands the 4th AirTransport Infantry Brigade.   The deaths and injuries Sunday occurred outside the entrance ofthe Villa Martelli base, about nine miles outside the capital, RadioRivadavia said. As loyal troops outside withdrew, hundreds ofpro-government demonstrators converged on the entrance, throwingfirebombs, rocks and bottles, it said.   Rebels fired back from inside the arsenal, and from two cars thatsped from the scene, the government news agency Telam reported.   With some government officials calling the revolt a coup attempt,officials on Saturday called on the public to rally for democracy.Tens of thousands poured into the streets nationwide.   The insurrection began Thursday when 53 members of an elite coastguard unit robbed an arsenal and deserted their base. Officers triedto incite troops at two other army bases in suburban Buenos Aires.   On Friday, about 400 troops led by Seineldin rebelled at aninfantry school at the huge Campo de Mayo base about 22 milesnorthwest of Buenos Aires.   Loyal government troops traded weapons fire with the rebels onFriday and five people were reported wounded.   But government guns were silent on Saturday, when most of thetroops at Campo de Mayo boarded army trucks and moved to the nearbyVilla Martelli, an arsenal equipped with tanks and explosives.   The movement by rebel troops without interference from loyalistsoldiers sparked fears that the insurgency was spreading.   In Buenos Aires, a city of 10 million, five television stationsbroadcast public messages urging people to defend democracy.   The insurrection was reported to have been triggered by theplanned resumption of trials of military officers implicated in awave of officially sanctioned terror during the grim years ofjunta-run military dictatorships.   A commission appointed by Alfonsin said nearly 9,000 Argentineswere arrested by security forces and presumed killed.   In December 1985, a civilian court convicted nine former militaryjunta members, including former Presidents Jorge Videla and RobertoViola, of human rights abuses.   Such trials were the impetus for similiar military uprisings inApril 1987 and January 1988. The revolts were quelled by Alfonsin'sgovernment.   Alfonsin became president in 1983 after the military junta _beleaguered by a horrendous economy and the humiliating defeat byBritain in the 1982 battle over the Falkland Islands _ alloweddemocratic elections.</TEXT></DOC>
