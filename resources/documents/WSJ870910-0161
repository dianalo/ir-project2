London stocks finished higher, while Frankfurt blue chips and other issues tumbled. Meanwhile, prices were up in Stockholm, Zurich, Paris and Sydney.    In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average, which fell 366.68 points in the half-day session Saturday, dropped 351.26 to 25,004.09. The first section index fell 27.47 to close at 2,067.61. Volume totaled 380 million shares, down from 400 million shares Saturday. Losers outnumbered gainers 730 to 162, while 128 issues were unchanged.    Investors tended to be conservative in the afternoon after the dollar failed to strengthen noticeably following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision Friday to raise the official discount rate to 6% from 5.5%.    Concern about the U.S. trade figures for July -- due out this week -- also unnerved investors worried about a further weakening of the dollar. Report of a wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in June toppled the dollar from the 150 yen in mid-August. A weaker dollar and stronger yen makes Japanese products relatively more expensive in the U.S. and elsewhere overseas.    Export-dependent electrical and computer stocks were lower, as were auto makers.    In the afternoon, the bearish trend deepened amid unconfirmed rumors that two other Japanese companies faced Tateho-type losses based on dealings in the Japanese government bond market. Last week Tateho Chemical Industries, a medium-sized maker of insulating materials and electrofused magnesia for heaters, said it had 20 billion yen ($142 million) in losses from such trading.    The rumors said Gun-ei Chemical Industry, a leading phenolic resin maker, and Asahi Kogyosha, an air conditioning engineering firm, would soon report similar losses, although both companies denied the speculation. Gun-ei Chemical fell 100 yen to 859 yen ($6.09), and Asahi Kogyosha also fell 100, to 875.    Securities firm and banking stocks finished lower.    While London trading was damped considerably by the Labor Day holiday in the U.S. markets, stock prices rose amid a late surge. The 100-share index was up 8.7 points at 2283.6, and the Financial Times 30-share index advanced 6.4 points to 1788.5. Volume was 394.7 million shares, down from 492.8 million shares Friday.    Real estate issues made notable gains. The stocks have gotten a boost, dealers said, from last week's statement by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson that the recent one point rise in bank base lending rates was sufficient. MEPC rose 17 pence to 556 pence ($9.21), Hammerson was up 15 at 675, and Land Securities moved up 18 to 578.    Retailers also rose, amid news that Britain's retail sales volume rose 1.4% in July from June and was up 7% from a year earlier. The figures were unchanged from a preliminary estimate Aug. 17. Great Universal Stores rose 20 pence to 12.98 pounds ($21.51), Next was up 12 pence at 355 pence, and Burton Group advanced 9 to 305.    Oil stocks, however, retreated amid weaker crude oil prices. North Sea Brent crude for October delivery slipped 30 cents a barrel to $17.90.    In Frankfurt, a late surge also helped stock prices, although they still finished lower across the board.    Stocks tumbled in the first hour of trading, pushed lower by the joint impact of a weakening dollar and rising interest rates, brokers said. They cited disappointment that the jump in the U.S. discount rate failed to stem the dollar's fall.    However, the main factor wasn't the currency situation, brokers said, but sharp declines in West German bond prices, following the drop in the U.S. bond market Friday. Expectations that interest rates will rise further in the U.S. and West Germany are bound to depress bond prices in both countries in the coming weeks, and that subsequently will worsen the investment climate for equities, brokers said.    Still, at midday, bargain-hunting by domestic investors helped lift stock prices. Barring new negative news, a continuation of that trend could help the market pull out of its present slump later this week, an analyst said.    Despite the late push, most blue chips ended the day at sharply lower levels, with auto makers the hardest hit. Daimler-Benz tumbled 25 marks to 1,046.00 marks ($583.93), Bayerische Motoren Werke dropped 20 to 750, and Volkswagen slid 5.3 to 389.2.    In Stockholm, there was a broad advance, with U.S. and Japanese investors and domestic banks pulling the market along. Interest rates eased during the session, contradicting expectations of a rise, and that also propelled buying, a dealer said.    Zurich stock prices were up in heavy trading, with Switzerland's major pension funds leading the drive, dealers said.    Paris stocks also were firm in heavy trading. Auto makers again led the gainers in the wake of the French government's decision Thursday to cut the value-added tax on automobiles.    In Sydney, Australian stocks finished higher, with banking issues making solid gains following the news late Friday that David Jones Ltd., 45%-owned by Adelaide Steamship, has acquired 9.8% of National Australia Bank, one of the country's four biggest banks.    Stock prices managed to rise despite Wall Street's decline Friday, the plunge in Tokyo yesterday and weaker gold prices. Mining stocks edged higher.
