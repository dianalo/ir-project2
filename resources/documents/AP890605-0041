RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today dealt a blow tominorities who say they are victims of on-the-job discrimination,making it easier for employers to refute claims of racial biasbased on statistical evidence.   By a 5-4 vote, the justices overturned a ruling that favoredFilipinos, Alaska natives and Asians employed at Alaska salmoncanneries.   The justices ordered further lower court hearings in the case.   In a sharply worded dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said theruling ``retreats'' from 18 years of court decisions aimed athelping minorities who are victimized by discrimination that may beunintentional.   He said the court was ``turning a blind eye to the meaning andpurpose'' of the principles underlying the federal Civil Rights Actof 1964 outlawing workplace discrimination. ``The changes themajority makes today, tipping the scales in favor of employers, arenot faithful to those principles,'' he said.   Today's ruling said when minorities allege that statistics showthey are victims of bias, employers only have the burden ofproducing evidence that there is a legitimate reaon for apparentlyneutral business practices.   The burden of proving the practice is non-discriminatory _ ofpersuading a jury there is no bias _ does not shift to theemployer, Justice Byron R. White said for the court.   ``The plaintiff bears the burden of disproving an employer'sassertion that the adverse employment action or practice was basedsolely on a legitimate neutral consideration,'' White said.   Furthermore, the court limited the statistical evidence thatminorities can use to prove discrimination.   White said an absence of minority group members in skilled jobsis not evidence of bias if the absence reflects ``a dearth ofqualified non-white applications for reasons that are not (theemployer's) fault.''   Also, he continued, the minority groups must show that anyunder-representation in a job category must be caused by specificbusiness practices that are under attack.   White said that without such protection for employers their onlyrecourse to eliminate racial imbalance intheir work forces would beunlawful quotas.   In other actions today, the Supreme Court:   _Dealt a significant defeat to the Church of Scientology, rulingin a 5-2 decision that contributions, called ``fixed donations,''to the church by its members may not be claimed as federal incometax deductions.   The court upheld the Internal Revenue Service's contention thatthe donations are not charitable contributions and rejectedarguments that denying tax deductions for the fixed donationsviolates the religious freedom of Scientologists and creates animpermissible denominational preference.   _Upheld the murder conviction and death sentence of Texas inmatePhilip Tompkins, but left unresolved in its 4-4 decision a keyquestion on how difficult it should be for prosecutors to provethey did not exclude potential jurors because of their race.   Tompkins, who is black, was convicted by an all-white jury ofthe 1981 slaying of Mary D. Berry in Houston. The prosecutor usedperemptory challenges to reject all 13 prospective jurors who wereblack.   _Cleared the way for trial of a government lawsuit against junkbond specialist Michael Milken and removed a major obstacle to a$650 million payment by his former employer to investors and thefederal treasury.   The court, without comment, rejected Milken's appeal todisqualify the federal judge presiding over the cases, U.S.District Judge Milton Pollack in New York City. Milken and twoco-defendants contended that Pollack has an apparent conflict ofinterest because his wife is receiving $30 million from the sale ofa corporation in which Milken's former employer, Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc., helped set up the financing.   _Left intact a 1986 federal law that generally prohibitsMedicare patients from using their own money to pay for anassistant surgeon in eye cataract operations.   A group of medicare patients in New York and California and eyedoctors and their professional associations in the two states hadcontended that the law violates constitutional privacy and libertyprotections.   _Ruled that a homeless-rights group, the Community for CreativeNon-Violence, does not own exclusively the copyright to a sculptureit commissioned an artist to create.   The 9-0 decision _ a victory for artists and authors _ orderedfurther lower court hearings to determine whether CCNV and itsfounder, Mitch Snyder, may share in the copyright of a work bysculptor James Earl Reid of Baltimore entitled ``Third WorldAmerica'' that depicts the plight of the homeless.   The bias case stems from discrimination charges against WardsCove Packing Co. Inc. of Seattle, Wash., and Castle andamp; Cooke Inc ofAstoria, Ore.   The companies operate salmon canneries in remote areas of Alaskaduring the summer salmon run.   Non-whites say that while they hold nearly half the jobs at thecanneries, the jobs are racially stratified with whites dominatingin higher-paying positions such as machinists, carpenters andadministrative slots.   The cannery companies said any racial divisions are caused bylegitimate business reasons.   For example, they said most higher-paying jobs require skill andprior experience that it is difficult for non-whites to acquirebecause they are seasonal workers from remote regions of Alaska.   The companies said statistics showing non-whites holding most ofthe lower-paying seasonal cannery worker jobs and fewer betterpositions do not prove discrimination.   The high court today agreed. White said the proper comparison isbetween the racial composition of the skilled jobs and the racialcomposition of the qualified population in the relevant labormarket.   The companies said the Pacific Northwest labor market thatprovides workers for the higher-ranking jobs is only 10 percentnon-white. The companies say they filled these more desirable jobswith more than 20 percent non-whites.   Joining White were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist andJustices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.   Joining Stevens in dissent were Justices William J. Brennan,Harry A. Blackmun and Thurgood Marsahall.   The case is Wards Cove vs. Atonio, 87-1387.</TEXT></DOC>
