The day was calm and theycould be towed ashore by station workboats without difficulty. Butthey could have overturned or been blown out to sea if the volatileAntarctic weather had taken a turn for the worse, the workers said.   In response to the diesel spill, the National Science Foundationdispatched navy and civilian pollution control experts with 52 tonsof specialized equipment. The mission cost more than $2 million. TheChilean and Argentine navies also sent costly clean-up missions.   The clean-up ended in mid-March, although the Bahia Paraiso stillholds about 63,000 gallons that can't be safely reached and pumpedout. It could spill if the ship breaks up in a winter storm orsimply seep out for many months as the wreck graduallydisintegrates. Experts say it would be too costly to haul the wreckaway.   The area of the spill teems with wildlife, including penguins,skuas, cormorants, Arctic terns and other birds. Seals and whalesfrequently pass through the bay.   Scientists say there already exists indirect evidence that manypenguins and other birds were poisoned by the spill, but they havebeen unable to determine the extent of the damage. A special team of15 researchers from the United States, Argentina and Chile hasarrived to begin a comprehensive study on the spill's environmentalimpact. It will take years to complete.   Yet there is no way a claim for damages can be made. Since theUnited States has no property rights to the area at or around PalmerStation, it has no legal grounds for seeking compensation. The areaof the accident, on the Antarctic Peninsula, is claimed by Chile,Argentina and Great Britain.   Chile recently announced plans to propose, at the next AntarcticTreaty meeting in Paris in October, an article to hold each countryfinancially responsible for environmental or other damage. TheScience Foundation plans to press for agreement on cost sharing inclean-up of spills and other accidents, and for formation of aninternational coordinating office for emergencies.   But there could be some opposition.   ``We must act with prudence, without falling into decisions thatcould be a little hasty,'' said Roberto Daverede, head of Antarcticaffairs for the Argentine Foreign Ministry. Argentina claims a thickwedge of the continent and, like the other claimant nations, rejectsany foreign or international jurisdiction.   Daverede played down the effects of the Bahia Paraiso spill.   ``This is far from being a natural catastrophe,'' he said. Hecalled the wreck ``an isolated incident.''   Nonetheless, less than a month after the Bahia Paraiso accident aPeruvian research ship ran aground 300 miles away, near King GeorgeIsland. The vessel, called the Humboldt and touted as the flagshipof Peru's territorial claim, also spilled some diesel fuel but wassoon refloated.   By world standards neither accident would qualify as a majorenvironmental disaster.   ``I've walked away from bigger diesel spills than this wherenothing died, absolutely nothing,'' said Jim O'Brien of Gretna, La.,a pollution control expert hired by the U.S. government for theBahia Paraiso clean-up.   But there is special concern that Antarctica's environment may beespecially fragile. There's also a growing belief that its huge coldmass plays a key role in long-term global weather patterns.   There also are some indications that the strain on the localenvironment may be straining political relations.   For decades, a unique spirit of international friendship andcooperation has reigned in Antarctica. Political conficts were leftat the doorstep, and missions from such idealogically distinctcountries as the Soviet Union and right-wing Chile lived asnext-door neighbors, sharing supplies, equipment and a drink or twoon the cold nights.   In early March, however, the Chileans criticized what they calledthe poor waste handling at the Soviet Bellinghousen base, literallya stone's from their own Marsh base on King George Island. They saidthey would file a complaint at the next treaty meeting.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 26</NOTE></DOC>
