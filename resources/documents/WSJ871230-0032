On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for February delivery rose 51 cents a barrel, to close at $16.93 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, traded at $16.95, up 55 cents, on the spot, or noncontract, market.    Crude products also posted gains: January-delivery heating oil was up 0.76 cent, to 51.89 cents a gallon, and gasoline up 0.75 cent, to 43.87 cents a gallon.    While standard year-end accounting concerns -- forcing oil companies to buy contracts to offset earlier positions -- fueled some of the price boosts, many traders said U.S. prices also moved up because of rumors of a supply &quot;squeeze&quot; in Europe.    The rumored squeeze involves the January-delivery contract for North Sea Brent, the U.K. benchmark blend. Traders exposed to that contract are buying the corresponding U.S. contract for February delivery to cover their position.    Another explanation for the price strength, but an explanation roundly ridiculed by some analysts, was the bitter winter weather in New York, a factor that supposedly reminds traders of the demand for heating oil.    &quot;A good part of the (price rise) has to do with people closing up accounts before the end of the year, for accounting reasons. It's just kind of funny it happened as strongly as it did considering the (negative) news you've had the last couple of days,&quot; said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. In particular, there is concern about suggestions of Saudi Arabian price discounting.    With indications that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' January output will stay at 18.3 million to 18.6 million barrels a day, &quot;the supply side of the market still looks bad,&quot; Mr. Rothman said.    Andrew Lebow, an oil analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said because of concerns about Saudi discounting and other negative factors, the 51-cent crude rise was &quot;surprising.&quot;    But Mr. Lebow said he wasn't surprised by heating oil's price strength, especially because of industry estimates of low supplies for winter.    The latest available heating-oil statistics might portend an easing of such stockpile problems, however.    After the market closed, weekly supply statistics from the American Petroleum Institute, a Washington, D.C., trade association, showed an unexpected 1.6%, or 2.1-million-barrel, increase in U.S. stocks of heating-oil and other distillate products, to 131.6 million barrels, for the week ended Friday.    &quot;I see that as somewhat negative (for prices),&quot; said Robert Boslego, whose Winchester, Mass.-based Boslego Corp. tracks oil-supply estimates.    Heating-oil imports were also &quot;extremely high&quot; in the weekly report, Mr. Boslego said. Thus, he noted, while U.S. heating-oil stockpiles are still extremely low relative to last year, total available supplies when imports are included have risen &quot;substantially&quot; in recent weeks.    &quot;There's reasonably good demand but given the relatively higher supplies than I had expected, I see (the API report) as negative for heating-oil futures,&quot; Mr. Boslego said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    COTTON: Prices retraced gains from last week, with the March-delivery contract closing down 1.08 cents at 68.52 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange. &quot;There was definite pressure today,&quot; said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. He said prices moved up sharply the two days before Christmas on technical factors. This week, &quot;just the opposite&quot; happened. Industry traders have been liquidating &quot;long hedge&quot; futures contracts -- or contracts they buy to protect against rises in cash prices -- as they go into the cash markets to buy cotton. Speculators, meanwhile, have sold contracts to take profits from last week's price rise.    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold, silver and platinum prices fell following supportive actions concerning the U.S. dollar, as they often do at least short-term. A weaker dollar suggests the possibility of inflation, making gold more attractive as a hedge. Current-delivery gold on New York's Commodity Exchange closed at $486.10 an ounce, giving up the $1.60 gain from the previous session. Silver fell 12.9 cents, to $6.713 an ounce. &quot;If you look at today's market, the dollar was unquestionably the most prominent influence on precious metals. The dollar dominated trading in gold,&quot; said William O'Neill, director of research at Elders Futures Inc., New York. Gold prices rose exactly as foreign currencies did against the dollar, he said, adding, &quot;You could take a gold chart and a (West German) mark chart and put them up against each other and it'd be almost identical.&quot; Gold prices for current delivery hit a high of $489.70 an ounce at the opening bell when the dollar was weakest, and fell at midmorning after news that U.S., European and Japanese central banks were buying U.S. dollars to support its price.    INTEREST RATES: Treasury-bond futures rose in thin trading as major players in the market seem to have taken to the sidelines until the new year, analysts said. March-delivery treasury-bond futures finished at 88 3/8, up 15/32. Analysts attributed the gains to reports that the Federal Reserve intervened to strengthen the dollar and to short covering. In short covering, traders buy back contracts they previously sold. Analysts said steps taken by the Fed to strenghten the dollar after Monday's plunge were widely anticipated. </TEXT></DOC>
