This has in practice takenon various forms; from the extreme case of very specific equipment developedand constructed by the State/Operator for use in only one facility, tothe more normal case where only the development is carried out by theState/Operator. This practice has advantages and disadvantages. For example,to ensure that Agency inspections will be carried out in a predictablemanner, it will be in the Operator's interest to ensure that any equipmenthe provides is of the highest quality, meets all national safety requirements,and is installed and maintained in such a manner that it will provideyears of service. Agency equipment performs its intended function ina reliable manner, but with very specific, limited applications in mind,improvements in reliability over that obtained with normal Agency equipmentare to be expected. Also, the authors experience is that reaching acceptablearrangements for the use of State- of Operator-supplied equipment isoften far more straightforward than when arranging to apply Agency equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
