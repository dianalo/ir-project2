As a result, it continued, the agency relies on selective spot-checking of probably less than 1% of domestically grown food to act as a deterrent.    Additionally, the report said, producers who market foods with illegal pesticide residues generally aren't penalized. Illegal pesticide residues are those that aren't allowed in food or are present in higher-than-allowed concentrations.    The study recommended that the FDA establish criteria for the level of pesticide testing, and suggested that Congress might want to give it authority to impose civil penalties.    The FDA doesn't currently have legal authority to detain domestic food while seeking court action to take it off the market. Also, the agency must rely on time-consuming and expensive criminal proceedings against growers.    Since 1979, the FDA's budget for monitoring pesticides rose to $13.7 million from $11.7 million, while its staff dropped to 309 employees from 325. An FDA spokesman said the report is being studied, but had no further comment. </TEXT></DOC>
