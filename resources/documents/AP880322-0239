The offer came last week when two State Department envoys metwith Noriega in Panama and encouraged him to step down, said theofficials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Noriega has refused to accept any arrangement that involves hisdeparture from Panama, although the government of Spain has offeredhim asylum.   The two State Department envoys _ William G. Walker and MichaelKozak _ told Noriega in their meeting that the U.S. proposal to flyhim into exile might be the ``last best offer'' he would receivefor ending the crisis in a way that ensured his personal safety,one official said.   The official said the offer would also allow Noriega's familyand friends to accompany him.   Senior administration officials believe Noriega will be forcedfrom office shortly because of growing opposition to his rule inthe Panamanian Defense Forces.   The officials, speaking only on condition they not be named,said the anti-Noriega sentiment within the military has beenaccelerating over the past week and is probably the most importantfactor working against his survival as defense chief.   They said Noriega's efforts to overcome the crisis probably werenot helped with his conditional offer Monday night to resign beforethe May 1989 presidential elections.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Panamaniansregard the offer as a ``ploy to buy time,'' a view he said wasshared by the United States.   ``The message from Panamanians is clear. For the good of Panama,Noriega should leave,'' Redman said, referring to the hostilereaction of Panamanian opposition leaders to the proposal and tothe continued virtual shutdown of the country because of a generalstrike.   ``His presence is the root cause of continued political andeconomic instability,'' Redman said. ``The ongoing general strikeis only the most recent demonstration of the overwhelmingopposition from all segments of Panamanian society to Noriega'scontinued rule.''   President Reagan, arriving on Capitol Hill on Tuesday for talkson his campaign to aid the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, said ``We feelNoriega should leave Panama'' when reporters asked him about thesituation in Panama.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said any proposalthat calls for Noriega's resignation as defense chief but does notinclude his actual departure from Panama ``is like getting the foxout of the hen house, then giving him quarters next door.''   Fitzwater said Noriega's plan would allow him to remain incontrol of the Defense Forces.   Noriega's offer to resign, announced Monday night in a nationalbroadcast by civilian chief of state Manuel Solis Palma, wasconditioned on a dialogue with the opposition.   Fissures in the Defense Forces were evident last Wednesday whenthere was a coup attempt against Noriega. Even though the plot wascrushed, officials said, a number of officers knew about theconspiracy but said nothing, rather than tip off Noriega.   ``The coup attempt was the tip of the iceberg,'' one officialsaid.   Discontent within the military ``is what everybody was lookingfor,'' he said. And almost without warning, ``there it was.''   This development is more significant than the wave of strikeactivity in recent weeks and the country's acute cash shortage,reflected in the government's inability to meet the public payroll,according to the officials.   Redman said the Defense Forces were weakened on Monday when aseries of promotions were announced. He said the promotions werebased on ``political, not professional, reasons.''   Noriega was said to have been defiant last Friday during a3{-hour meeting with two State Department envoys who encouraged himto resolve the crisis by seeking political asylum in Spain oranother third country.   Noriega told the envoys they had come under the influence ofPanamanian ``oligarchs'' opposed to him and that the Americans``were dumb enough to believe them,'' one official said.   The two officials _ Walker and Kozak _ appealed forcefully toNoriega to step down but were rebuffed.   They told Noriega that unless he resigns, the Panamanian DefenseForces could fall into disrepute and suffer the same fate as theNicaraguan National Guard. This was a reference to the militaryforce which served under the Somoza family dynasty and wasdismantled by the Sandinista government after the 1979 revolution.   Noriega also was told that the Reagan administration is eager tosee the Defense Forces survive and to continue its prescribed roleas guardian of national sovereignty.   Walker and Kozak reportedly encouraged Noriega, who is underindictment on drug smuggling charges in Florida, to accept an offerby Spain under which he would be allowed to go to that country,provided he asks for asylum and the United States does not seek hisextradition the drug charges.   The United States says the legitimate government in Panama isthat of President Eric Arturo Delvalle, who tried to dismissNoriega on Feb. 25.   But the Noriega-dominated National Assembly voted to oustDelvalle and Palma was named new head of state. Noriega opponentsthen called for a general strike in protest.</TEXT></DOC>
