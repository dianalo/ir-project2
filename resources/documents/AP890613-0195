Remember the halcyon days of the Elliott clan, when all threenetworks would set up in the two-acre yard behind ``the Hut,'' thefamily's fabulous Upper East Side mansion _ better known nowadays asthe Metropolitan Museum of Art _ to cover those fairytale birthdayparties that famous comedian Bob Elliott (one half of Bob and Ray)would throw for his youngest son, Chris, who grew up to besemifamous as a regular on ``Late Night With David Letterman''?   Did any of us realize that those were all Bob Elliott's friends?Did any of us really think a 6-year-old would invite Dick Cavett tohis birthday party? Or Jerry Vale? Or Andy Rooney and Charles Kuralt_ who wrestled shirtless, for Pete's sake?   Well, it seems that after long years of painful self-examination,Chris Elliott has finally found the courage to write the book thatexplodes the myth _ ``Daddy's Boy.'' It makes ``Mommie Dearest'' _and Jackie Rogers Jr.'s ``Damn You, Daddy Dearest'' _ look like loveletters!   What a shock to find out that Bob Elliott was so egomaniacal, henamed his sons Bob Jr., 1 through 9 _ except the twins, who were 5Aand 5B. Chris, the 10th son, was even forced to wear a latex``bald'' wig so he would look more like his father. ``OttoPreminger,'' Chris' heartless classmates called him.   ``How could I make people listen to me?'' Chris writessearchingly in his opening chapter. ``How could I tell the storythat so desperately needed telling, and maybe make a few bucks inthe process, and then it hit me like a ton of bricks. Write a book!...   ``But wait a second, was I nuts? Did I really have enoughcomplaints about growing up to fill a book? I convinced myself thatthat didn't matter. The only important thing was that I get my faceon the cover.''   What also mattered was the legal action Bob Elliott was sure totake when Chris let him have it in the tell-all book. To assuage thelegal eagles, Chris gamely offered his father a rebuttal to eachchapter.   ``I don't know what Chris is talking about,'' Bob complains inhis rebuttal to Chapter 1 of ``Daddy's Boy'' (Delacorte Press,$12.95). ``Chris doesn't have nine brothers. He has three sistersand one brother. We did not live in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,and I have never in my life had the pleasure of meeting Mr. JerryVale, although I would not turn down such an opportunity if itpresented itself. Do my lawyers actually think people are going totake this book seriously?''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   BUSH'S FIRST 100 DAYS ON TELEVISION _ Media Monitor, a researchpublication of the Center for Media Studies in Washington, says CBSwas tougher on President George Bush during his first 100 days inoffice than NBC or ABC.   A study by the non-profit media research group found Bushreceived favorable personal evaluations, but his policies wereassessed positively only 39 percent of the time on CBS, compared to63 percent favorable on NBC. ABC gave Bush 85 percent positiveevaluations, according to the analysis.   Whether negative or positive, Bush is getting less coverage thanhis predecessors, according to the study. He has drawn 37 percentfewer stories than Ronald Reagan did in 1981 and 45 percent fewerthan Jimmy Carter in 1977.
