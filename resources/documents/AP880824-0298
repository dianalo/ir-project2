Hartman said Tuesday the withdrawals apparently reflect concernabout the approaching end of a guarantee on deposits above $100,000and the loss of additional deposit insurance that was availablethrough the 40-bank system of NCNB Texas' predecessor, FirstRepublicBank Corp.   In late July, NCNB, based in Charlotte, N.C., acquired theformer banks of First RepublicBank from the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. NCNB agreed to invest up to $240 million for the130 Texas banking locations of First RepublicBank, which wasdeclared insolvent.   NCNB initially will acquire a 20 percent stake in the bank buthas an option to buy the rest from the FDIC, which promised to pump$4 billion into the Texas institution.   ``I don't know if it is possible to find a more soundinstitution anywhere,'' Hartman said.   Under terms of an agreement announced July 29, the FDIC plannedto withdraw the additional coverage for deposits above $100,000that it installed in March to halt a run on First RepublicBank.   The move does not affect the normal coverage of up to $100,000offered to depositors at all federally insured institutions.   Hartman said NCNB has alternative sources of funding _ including$3 billion in cash due from the FDIC as part of the transaction _and faces no cash squeeze because of withdrawals.   In fact, NCNB expects withdrawals to total as much as $600million, about 10 percent of the $6 billion in the $100,000-plusaccounts the bank maintains.   Hartman said depositors apparently had grown accustomed to theluxury of multibank insurance, a program through which customerscould spread their deposits among several First RepublicBankinstitutions for additional FDIC protection.</TEXT></DOC>
