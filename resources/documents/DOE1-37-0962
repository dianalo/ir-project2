There is littleundeveloped land near the major loads of England and Wales. In addition,the western coastline, where the resource is abundant, is highly valuednationwide for its beauty. So much so that much of it is now protectedfrom further development. As a maritime nation the U.K. is oriented towardsthe sea more than most. It was only a matter of time before constraintson land use and the country's lengthy coastline led planners to the shallowwaters off-shore. In an effort to detail the potential of offshore siting,Taywood Engineering (one of the many firms in the Taylor Woodrow group)undertook a thorough assessment of the U.K.'s offshore resource for theCEGB. Only shallow areas between 35 feet and 164 feet within three milesof shore were considered. The inventory of suitable sites was furtherreduced by conflicts with shipping lanes, fisheries, and areas used bythe military or for dredging. The final inventory included only thosesites with suitable sea bed conditions. The tally? Taywood estimatesthat 12,000 wind turbines 100 meters (328 feet) in diameter could beinstalled in the areas deemed probable for development - representingenough capacity to satisfy some 92% of current U.K. electrical consumption.</TEXT></DOC>
