The decline came the day after the Senatepassed a sweeping interest-rate ceiling on credit card debt.Proposed by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.), this strangeregulation was intended to jump start the lagging economy,presumably by spurring consumers to buy on credit.   The rush to approve the measure was largely a consequenceof President Bush's statement of support, made earlier in theweek, for lower credit card interest rates. Speaking aboutthe proposal, Mr. Bush said, &quot;thank God we have people likeAl fighting for for our values every day.&quot; The plunge in thestock market was a reaction to the expected negative economiceffects of this credit card cap, and of the pro-regulatorybent of the Bush administration. Or was it?</LP><TEXT>   Last week the Securities and Exchange Commission'sDivision of Market Regulation released a report on the causesof the Nov. 15, 1991, plunge, in response to a request byRep. Edward Markey, chairman of the House committee thatoversees the SEC. This study, credited to William Heyman (thenew director of market regulation) concludes that the stockmarket plunge was unrelated to credit card caps. Rather weare told that &quot;the market decline on November 15, 1991 hadmore to do with institutional investment outlooks, concernsover protecting year-to-date market gains, and intermarketdynamics than any single `triggering' news event.&quot;   Mr. Heyman, a former professional trader, uses his reportto issue a paternalistic word of caution to the world offinancial journalists and economic researchers. It is futileto try to show that specific market information causedspecific stock-market moves, he warns. Rather, he insiststhat &quot;most market swings are better understood in the contextof longer-term institutional investment outlooks, as well asthe short-term effects of professional and speculativetrading strategies.&quot;   The SEC would have us believe that the stock marketplunged 4% on this particular day, not because President Bushendorsed credit controls and the Senate then passed them, butbecause institutional traders came back from lunch thatFriday and collectively decided to become concerned withlocking in their year-to-date gains that very afternoon. Nooffense, Mr. Heyman, but your former professional-tradercolleagues must still be giggling over this transparentattempt to cover for the boss.   The SEC blames institutional traders and their black-magicstrategies for artificially depressing the stock market. Nowthat the New York Stock Exchange's Rule 80A effectively bansprogram trading whenever the market moves by more than 50points, a larger decline such as the 120 points on Nov. 15can no longer be blamed on program trading. This SEC reportunveils the new scapegoat: &quot;esoteric market-tradingstrategies by institutional traders trying to lock in profitsand to protect against losses.&quot;   Naturally, Chairman Markey and the SEC now plan toinvestigate these new dynamic hedging strategies and the useof OTC puts to see whether these might &quot;pose a potentialfuture risk for downward market volatility.&quot; The politicalmarket for financial regulations, however harmful, continuesto thrive.   The SEC report also presents survey evidence that theSEC-approved restrictions on program trading averted an evensteeper market plunge on Nov. 15. It says that &quot;in telephoneinterviews on November 15 and 18, traders at several firmsexpressed a consensus that the stabilization requirements ofNYSE Rule 80A served to mitigate the velocity of the pricedrop on November 15.&quot;   Let us get this straight. The SEC called some traders, whoare regulated by the SEC, to ask if they thought the SEC wasdoing a good job, and the response was overwhelminglyaffirmative. Well, with this proof that Rule 80A isstabilizing the stock market, the dozens of researchers outthere still studying this issue can now turn off theircomputers and go home. Using this SEC-style surveymethodology, the IRS can demonstrate that taxpayers believethe tax code is &quot;fair,&quot; and professors can demonstrate thatstudents find their lectures are brilliant.   Such posturing is no substitute for an economic study.What would a professionally competent study of the cause ofthe Nov. 15 stock-market plunge have contained that the SECreport lacked? First, an exhaustive study of the news storiesreported in the financial press and the newswires. This datais computerized and widely available.   The SEC report cites only one article and mentions inpassing that many kinds of stories were published in the weekending Nov. 15. This obscures the plain fact that the DowJones Retrieval Service carried more than 65 stories on thecredit-card flap during Nov. 13-18. Sure, there were otherstories, such as the decline in biotechnology stocks, badreal-estate news for some insurance firms, and certainmacroeconomic news. But, the credit-card stories absolutelydominated, consistent with the &quot;triggering event&quot; hypothesis.   A second part of a good study would examine whether or notthe implications of the SEC's favored &quot;institutional traders&quot;theory is consistent with any data. For example, the theorythat the Nov. 15 decline was caused by herd-like behaviorimplies a bounce-back reaction in the next trading session ortwo. This is because price pressures resulting from temporarytrading overloads create price gaps that are arbitraged awayas prices return to levels reflecting fundamentals. The SECknows this full well. It has long highlighted the pricerebounds after triple-witching Fridays as evidence of thedeleterious effects of the expiration-induced trading. Thistime, there was no rebound. The stock market stayed at itsreduced level until December, when the Federal ReserveBoard's interest rate cuts boosted the stock market.   Next, a good study would recognize that if the credit cardflap triggered the market decline, then we would expect thestock-price decline to be larger for the money-center banks.Examining general indexes, we find that the New York StockExchange's finance index fell 6.1% from Nov. 14 to Nov. 19,compared with a decline of 4.2% in the composite index. Forindividual stocks, banks with the greatest exposure tocredit-card business had the greatest stock-price declines.Banc One lost 9% from Nov. 12 to Nov. 20, First Chicago lost11.4%, Citicorp lost 9%, and Chase Manhattan lost 7.5%. MBNACorp., whose entire business is credit cards, lost 21.5% overthis same period.   Even a cursory glance at the data is sufficient to refutethe SEC's conclusions. The SEC's constituents deservesomething better than this sorry effort.   ---   Mr. Jarrell, chief economist of the SEC from 1984 to 1987,is professor of finance at Rochester University's Simonbusiness school.</TEXT></DOC>
