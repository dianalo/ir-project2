Beaches were again packed with partying teen-agers early today.An estimated 30,000 students were staying in this resort islandtown near Corpus Christi, said Coast Guard spokesman Anthony E.Lloyd.   ``I think things are back to normal for a spring break, which isin no way normal,'' Beck said.   Authorities said mainly high school students appeared to beinvolved in early Sunday's three-hour disturbance by 3,000 youths,authorities said.   ``What you have down there is a tremendous amount ofintoxication going on. All it takes sometimes is for someone tobump into someone else. The crowd just turned into a riot,'' saidOfficer Jim Kaelin of the Texas Department of Public Safety.   The disturbance began when a motorist struck a 16-year-old girlon the beach and then attempted to leave, said Police Chief DonPerkins. Angry youths began to attack the driver, but he was pulledaway by police.   The youths then tipped over the man's car and torched it,Perkins said.   ``They stomped the car, broke all the glass out of it andflipped it over,'' said Tom Frazier, 22, a University of Texasstudent.   More than 100 officers aided by tear gas and hovering CoastGuard helicopters with searchlights worked to restore order.   The accident victim was treated for minor injuries. The driver,John Montanes, 26, of San Antonio, was charged with failure to stopand render aid and was in jail Sunday night in lieu of $500 bond.   Two police officers were injured and eight people, including oneaccused of inciting a riot, were arrested as a result of the melee,police said.   Authorities reported at least four people were stabbed inunrelated attacks and a car containing the bodies of two young menwas found in Corpus Christi Bay. About a mile from the riot site,the car crashed through a barrier hours after the disturbance andsank in water 20 to 25 feet deep, said Coast Guard spokesmanAnthony E. Lloyd in Corpus Christi.   The victims' identities were not released.   Perkins said all eight of his officers were on duty late Sunday.   ``You never expect a riot,'' Perkins said. ``You don't want itto occur, and with the cooperation of the students it won't occur.However, last night we got no cooperation.''   He said his officers felt seriously threatened at one pointduring the melee.   ``When bottles and cans are being thrown at you, you get tofeeling endangered,'' Perkins said.   While most of the injured were treated and released Sunday, a17-year-old stabbing victim remained hospitalized in satisfactorycondition today at AMI Coastal Bend hospital.</TEXT></DOC>
