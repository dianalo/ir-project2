<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-0115 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effective interaction between {Lambda} and {alpha} is obtained byfolding the {Lambda}-N interaction to the nucleon density of the {alpha}particle, which gives the correct form factor of {alpha} particle inthe high energy electron scattering experiment. Using this effectiveinteraction, the binding energy of the doudle {Lambda} in /sub {Lambda}{Lambda}//sup6/He and the binding energy of {Lambda} in /sub {Lambda}{Lambda}//sup9/Be was calculated by means of the adiabatic approximation to the hypersphericalharmonic method. The results are satisfactory.</TEXT></DOC>
