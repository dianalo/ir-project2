Mikdad Morad, the announcer who normally reads statements fromPresident Saddam Hussein, also warned Bush that a showdown in theGulf will end ``in a catastrophe'' for U.S. forces.   ``Bush's message is full of lies and contradictions,'' Moradsaid. He spoke immediately after Bush's taped message was broadcaston Iraqi TV.   Bush, in his message, told the Iraqis: ``Iraq stands isolatedand alone.''   ``Saddam Hussein tells you that this crisis is a strugglebetween Iraq and America. In fact, it is Iraq against the world,''said Bush, standing in front of his Oval Office desk with a U.S.flag behind him. ``Iraq finds itself on the brink of war.''   But he said, ``war is not inevitable. It is still possible tobring this crisis to a peaceful end.''   Morad, reading from a prepared text, responded:   ``Should war be imposed on us, the Iraqi people will nothesitate in joining to teach the aggressor an important leasson,which neither they, nor their allies and agents, will ever forget.   ``Your aggression,'' Morad told Bush, ``will end in acatastrophe for your forces.''   Morad, a familiar face on Iraqi television who was the onlyspokesman authorized to release military communiques during theeight years of war with Iran, ridiculed Bush's references to humanrights and international law.   ``Contemporary history has not witnessed worse violations ofinternational law than those committed by the United States and itsally, Israel,'' he said.   ``It is enough to recall that the United States has used morethan 60 times the veto to knock down resolutions against Israel atthe U.N. Security Council,'' he said, reapeating Arab criticismthat the United States applies double standards in dealing with theinvasion of Kuwait and the Israeli occupation of Arab territories.   Morad said Bush was ``shedding crocodile tears for foreigners''banned from traveling out of Iraq and Kuwait after Saddam's Aug. 2invasion and subsequent annexation of Kuwait.   ``They want to leave because of the embargo imposed by theUnited States,'' Morad said.   He said ``Bush went crazy after Iraq entered Kuwait ... becausehe feared his oil interests were jeopardized, and not out ofconcern for the former Kuwaiti leaders, because he knows from whatrotten background these Croesuses were molded.''   Croesus was a 6th-century B.C. king famous for his great wealthand his debauchery.   Morad said Bush was ``naive when he tried to separate the peopleof Iraq from their leader.''   ``Our leader is the people's son,'' Morad said. ``This attemptreflects Bush's despair.''   He said the conflict ``is not at all, as Bush says, one betweenIraq and the United States. It is one between the United States andthe Iraqis, Arabs, Moslems and all the sincere people of the world.   ``It is a conflict between right and injustice; between obscenewealth and oppressed people; between imperialism-Zionism and thedeprived people.   ``It is thundering rage in the Moslem and Islamic world againstthe United States,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
