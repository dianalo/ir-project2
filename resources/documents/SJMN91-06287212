He'srestored San Juan Bautista's Plaza Hotel, Mission San Jose in Fremont -- a jobthat took seven years -- and recently completed Santa Cruz Mission StateHistorical Park Adobe, built as a barracks for Indian laborers.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  West  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ADOBEADOBE WILL LAST HUNDREDS OF YEARS UNLESS EXPOSEDTO THE ELEMENTS.THEN IT'S A PILE OF MUD.  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  WESTPRIMER; JOANNE JACOBS is a Mercury News columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;My name is Sanchez. I'm of Mexican descent. What I'm doing has a lot to dowith Hispanic culture.&quot;;   Adobe goes way, way back. The Babylonians andEgyptians built with mud. The Moors taught building techniques to the Spanish,who brought adobe construction to Mexico, and then north to California.;  &quot;Eighty percent of the world lives in earthen buildings,&quot; Sanchez says. In dryclimates, adobe is very durable -- if the roof stays on. &quot;It will last forhundreds of years, but if it is exposed to the elements, it's a pile of mud.&quot;;  The thick walls -- essential to add structural strength -- keep adobes coolin summer and warm in winter.;   The early adobe builders would dig a largebasin, where they mixed dirt and water with binders such as reeds, weeds,shells, and sometimes just trash. When the mixture thickened, the goop waspoured into molds and dried in the sun.;   The early Spanish adobes were builtaround an inner courtyard, with thick windowless walls facing the outsideworld. American settlers added more wood and windows to the original style.;  In the 1830s, Thomas Oliver Larkin pioneered the Monterey Colonial style,which used design elements from New England and the South. Adding a redwoodframe made it possible to build a second story, and plantation-style verandasprotected the walls from the dangers of water. Homes were whitewashed everyyear to protect the adobe, often with pastel tints.;   In restoring oldadobes, Sanchez analyzes the brick to learn how much sand, straw and soil wereused, even the size of the sand grains. Then the new bricks are made on thesite, along with roof tiles.;   To return to the past takes extensiveresearch. Mission San Jose took seven years. Sanchez worked with a historianand an archaeologist.;   The goal of restoration is to preserve as much of thehistorical fabric of the building as possible -- while making sure it willhold up in an earthquake. Often that means removing cement plaster and otherlate additions, then figuring out what the building originally looked like.;  Restoration can be a detective story. In a San Juan Capistrano project, anelderly lady dropped by and said she used to play in the building as a child-- in the attic. Sanchez asked her if she could remember where the stairswere. When she pointed out the spot, he noticed the faint outline.;   Adobesnot only preserve California's past, Earth-friendly earthen homes could be theshelter of the future. Today, Sanchez works and lives in a passive solar adobein Santa Cruz. It was designed six years ago by his girlfriend.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Joanne Jacobs  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911013  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  587  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, October 13, 199100287212,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
