Ronald Carey, RCAS program manager, presented to the 500-pageRFP and 22-volume functional description at a conference for vendors at FortBelvoir, Va.andP;  Carey said the RCAS staff recently submitted a new costevaluation study to the Army, but he would not disclose any details of thestudy.andM;In May, the Army cut $140 million from the multiyear RCAS spending planbecause of what officials called inaccurate cost estimates for completesystem deployment.andP;  Carey said the Army will present a new funding proposalnear the end of this year.andM;Gen.andP;  Bruce Harris, the Army's director of command, control, communicationsand computers, told Congress earlier this year the funds for RCAS would berestored to the proposed 1990 budget if the program stayed on schedule.andP;  Thefinal RFP, which is expected by the end of the year, must be approved by thesecretary of Defense's Major Automated Information Systems Review Council(MAISRC).andP;  RCAS has already passed three internal Army MAISRC reviews, Careysaid.andM;Carey said program officials plan to spend up to $34 million to developdemonstration systems, if they can get the money.andP;  The demonstration fundswere among the items cut by the Army.andP;  &quot;It will be all I can do to get themoney back,&quot; he said.andP;  While Carey would not say how many finalists would beselected to develop demonstration systems, an Army ADP source said only twowould be picked.andM;The finalists will be selected based on their proposal scores in the areas ofmanagement, logistics, technical and mission suitability.andP;  A vendor'sproposed implementation cost also will be considered in choosing thefinalists, the RFP said.andM;Finalists must demonstrate their versions of RCAS a their own facilities butwill work with actual reserve units in implementing their solutions, Careysaid.andP;  According to the RFP, the system must have office automation,telecommunications, distributed databases and distributed processingcapability.andM;The document says the Army plans to use RCAS to automate wartime mobilizationand provide ADP support for daily Guard administrative functions.andM;The system will include capabilities for electronic mobilization, electronicorder and information issuing, automated unit assessment and validation,management and maintenance of personnel and equipment data.andP;  It also will beinteroperable with active Army ADP systems and provide logistical support fordeployment readiness, equipment and personnel redistribution and managementprocedures.andM;Although the hardware need not be &quot;warsurvivable,&quot; vendors are free toprovide ruggedized equipment, none of which can be furnished by thegovernment.andP;  The RCAS hardware must be off-the-shelf, and the system mustlast 10 years.andM;The statement of work said RCAS will be a workstation-based system.andP;  Thedatabase, which will use Structured Query Language, will be accessed andoperated via existing networks as well as RCAS-specific local area and widearea networks.andM;Network requirements include conformance to the Government Open SystemsInterconnection Profile specification and compatibility with the Defense DataNetwork.andP;  The RCAS operating system need only be the latest version ofwhatever is proposed.andP;  The RFP does not mention the Ada language.andM;Carey also said he is considering changing the name of the program.andP;  He saidconfusion sometimes results because the RCAS office is in charge of otherreserve component automation programs.andP;  Mobilization Administration ReserveComponents, or MARC, he said, might make more sense.andM;Vendor comments are due Aug. 15.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
