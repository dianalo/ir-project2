Goldstein, general partner of Santa MonicaPartners in New York. As an active investor in the fitfullytraded Pink Sheets stocks, he wonders how soon the newelectronic system can meet its two-fold purpose: to providegreater ease of trading and closer surveillance for thesestocks.</LP><TEXT>   But if the computerized market catches on, Mr. Goldsteinand others say, it is likely to make the shares of thousandsof obscure companies more visible and less susceptible tofraud. It also will boost the exposure of several hundredforeign companies such as Japan's Nintendo Co. and WestGermany's Deutsche Bank AG, which trade over the counterbecause they don't meet larger markets' tougher disclosurerules.   The OTC Bulletin Board, approved last week by theSecurities and Exchange Commission, was developed by theNational Association of Securities Dealers, theself-regulatory body for the over-the-counter market. NASDPresident Joseph Hardiman says the system is designed tobetter regulate some of the thousands of OTC stocks thataren't traded on NASD's electronic trading system, and togive these stocks greater visibility among investors.   NASD estimates that 47,000 issues are traded over thecounter in the U.S. Of these, 4,300 meet itsminimum-net-worth and other standards for tradingelectronically on the National Association of SecuritiesDealers Automated Quotations system, or Nasdaq.   About 10,000 to 12,000 of the more active issues areavailable to dealers once a day in the Pink Sheets, publishedsince 1913 by New Jersey-based National Quotation BureauInc., a subsidiary of Commerce Clearing House Inc.,Riverwoods, Ill. First printed on colored paper in the 1920sto reduce glare from incandescent lights, the Pink Sheets nowconsist of a 330-page volume or electronic list delivereddaily to 2,000 customers, says David Burnett, president ofthe National Quotation Bureau.   &quot;The Pink Sheets are a primitive communications device,&quot;concedes Mr. Burnett, whose company has a one-year contractto provide NASD with data for the bulletin board. He addsthat there are some crucial differences between the OTCBulletin Board and the Nasdaq system launched in 1971.   &quot;It's a Nasdaq with no Ten Commandments,&quot; he contends.   The OTC Bulletin Board is designed to provide dealerselectronically with Pink Sheet stock quotes throughout theday, instead of once daily. Using their current Nasdaqterminals, NASD member firms' market makers will be able, butnot obliged, to enter or update price quotations on PinkSheets stocks.   Dealers in Nasdaq stocks now are required to provide firmbid and asked, or selling, prices at the risk of facing finesor suspension if they don't honor their quotes. But OTCBulletin Board dealers will be able simply to list theirnames and phone numbers, with no bid or asked prices. Theycan list &quot;unfirm&quot; prices or firm quotes.   The system will sort the listings, with firm quotes at thetop and the least-firm interest at the bottom. A dealerfailing to honor a firm quote may face enforcement action.But there's nothing to make a dealer offer a firm quote,notes Mr. Burnett. He predicts that as Nasdaq slowlytightened its requirements as it evolved, so will thebulletin board become stricter.   Mr. Goldstein says several dealers told him that they willbe reluctant to tip their hands on the bulletin board. Somedealers may be surprised to find there simply aren't anysellers for some Pink Sheets stocks, he adds. In Mr.Goldstein's view, the market won't become truly competitiveuntil stock quotes and other information are available toinvestors through their brokers rather than one step removedat the dealer level. On the other hand, intraday information&quot;may shed some light where there's been none before.&quot;   Since last week's approval, 13 NASD members have signedcontracts to use the bulletin board, according to S. WilliamBroka, NASD vice president of business development. TrosterSinger Corp., one of the nation's largest traders of PinkSheet stocks, is ready to go with the new trading system,says Ralph Valentino, president of the Jersey City, N.J.,brokerage firm. He explains that now his brokers make atleast three telephone calls to get competing quotes on PinkSheets stocks before executing an order. With quotesavailable on a computer screen, they will be able to executeorders faster. Data on foreign stocks will be updated onlytwice a day while that for U.S. stocks will be updatedcontinuously.   While the Pink Sheets stocks may become easier to trade,NASD's Mr. Hardiman cautions, they're not for everyone. &quot;Alot, if not all of them in this market, are speculativestocks,&quot; he warns. He excludes from this group some of thelarger foreign issues whose American depositary receiptstrade in the Pink Sheets.   A more upbeat view comes from Mr. Goldstein, the PinkSheets investor. &quot;It's just like Nasdaq,&quot; he says. &quot;There'sjunk and blue chips and everything in between.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Last week's rally in technology stocks helped theover-the-counter market recover to its highest level in threeweeks.
