Under the law, the Senate must -- and the House has theoption to -- consider a resolution lifting the spendingceilings set last year if either the CBO or the White HouseOffice of Management and Budget forecasts two consecutivequarters of a shrinking economy. Congress isn't likely toapprove such a resolution, however, congressional leaderssay.</LP><TEXT>   CBO Director Robert Reischauer is expected to deliver hisrecession notice in testimony before the Senate BudgetCommittee this morning. In a somewhat unusual move, Mr.Reischauer is carrying a Jan. 15 letter from White HouseBudget Director Richard Darman in which Mr. Darmanacknowledges that the administration also forecasts arecession. Noting that the law charges the CBO with alertingCongress when either the CBO or the OMB predicts recession,Mr. Darman suggests Mr. Reischauer simply release a copy ofthe Jan. 15 letter, a copy of which was obtained by thisnewspaper.   The administration has estimated that the gross nationalproduct -- the nation's output of goods and services --shrank at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3.4% in thefourth quarter and will shrink an additional 1.3% in thecurrent quarter. But the administration hasn't publiclyreleased those estimates. The CBO puts GNP shrinkage at 2.6%for the fourth quarter and 1.4% for the first quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
