There was little new business to battle for, he explains. Clients became much more sensitive about fees, he adds. Most tellingly, &quot;It wasn't easy to outperform market benchmarks&quot; such as the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.    On average, equity managers lagged behind the Sandamp;P by about one percentage point, according to a survey of more than 1,000 portfolios by Indata, a Southport, Conn., research firm. Meanwhile, bond managers were about 0.5 percentage point behind the Salomon Brothers Broad Investment Grade bond index. Narrow as those differences are, they were enough to make many clients look harder at the performance of their active money managers.    Still, money management remained one of the most profitable and low-risk specialties in the whole sweep of financial services. While money managers typically charge management fees of less than 1% of assets, insiders say as much as half those fees translate into gross profit margins.    Management fees continued to rise in 1986, according to SEI Corp., a Wayne, Pa.-based pension consultant. It found that equity managers typically charged 0.56% of assets, compared with 0.42% in 1982. Bond managers typically charged 0.38% of assets, compared with 0.35% in 1982. With total U.S. pension assets approaching $2 trillion, those figures suggest that money managers' overall revenue last year amounted to roughly $10 billion.    &quot;This has been a sensational business for us, much better than people had any right to expect,&quot; said a major East Coast money manager, who requested anonymity. &quot;It's almost like the way the auto workers were when Detroit was booming. We're looking over our shoulders now, wondering what's going to catch us.&quot;    Several challenges arose last year, led by &quot;performance fees.&quot; Instead of paying money managers a flat percentage of assets no matter how well or poorly they do, many clients began talking about adjusting fees in relation to investment results. Typically, money managers would earn meager fees unless they could beat market indexes. Some big state pension plans, such as Minnesota and California, were enthusiastic champions of performance fees, while most money managers kept a cautiously neutral stance.    Index funds also continued to surge last year. These funds just try to match the performance of market indexes by owning most of the stocks in the index and rarely trading them. At year's end, Salomon Brothers estimated stock-index funds amounted to $150 billion, with another $50 billion in bond-index funds. Management fees for these funds were far below industry norms, making them appealing to clients.    Meanwhile, the bull market of the past few years left many pension funds with greater assets than their actuaries required. As a result, plan sponsors stopped giving much new money to portfolio managers, and in some cases actually withdrew funds. &quot;It's getting a lot tougher to get new business,&quot; declared the chief investment officer of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.'s money management unit, Peter Marron, who added several big new clients anyway.    Some unusual new ways to invest attracted billions of dollars. Notable among them was portfolio insurance, a way of using financial futures to hedge against market drops. A Los Angeles firm founded by several finance professors, Leland O'Brien andamp; Rubenstein, became the leader here, advising clients on more than $25 billion of assets.    Also winning favor, especially with state and municipal pension plans, were &quot;South Africa-free&quot; funds. These portfolios only invested in companies without any business in South Africa. Market theoreticians argued that this strategy was likely to hurt investment results, or involve greater risks.    But a survey by Brian Rom, a New York consultant, found that South Africa-free accounts tended to outperform market averages in 1986. His explanation: they eliminated some large lumbering companies that didn't do well for reasons unrelated to their South African investments.    Highly computerized methods of stock picking also gained favor. In San Francisco, Wells Fargo Investment Advisers promoted &quot;tilt funds&quot; as a variation on its usual index funds. These funds continued to invest in most Sandamp;P 500 stocks, but with an emphasis on stocks with certain financial ratios that Wells found attractive. &quot;We've found these can significantly outperform the Sandamp;P,&quot; said Robert Haber, a Wells vice president.    Foreign stocks attracted a tidal wave of U.S. pension money, spurred by the dollar's decline and the soaring Tokyo market. A host of newcomers vied with traditional leading international money managers such as Britain's Morgan Grenfell andamp; Co. and the overseas investment department of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. for the business.    Rampant job-hopping continued as well. In one celebrated case, Putnam Advisory Co.'s international chief, Walter Oechsle, left to set up his own firm, taking some Putnam employees with him. Putnam promptly sued Mr. Oechsle. He responded with a counterclaim. Eventually, though, the sides settled their differences out of court.    The robust profits of investment firms also continued to attract outside buyers. In the spring, T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., a Baltimore mutual fund and pension management firm, sold shares to the public. And in October, Forstmann-Leff Associates Inc. agreed to be bought by Guinness Peat Group PLC of Britain for at least $90 million.    For money managers in general, &quot;product innovation was one of the bright spots of the year,&quot; says Mr. Canter of Chase. He cites two major examples: new uses of stock and bond index futures to hedge against market risks, and the development of specialized international funds. Some enterprising money managers even combined the two techniques, using British, Japanese and Australian stock-index futures in global equity accounts.    Mr. Canter argues that investment professionals will be hard-pressed to find appealing, non-traditional ways for clients to invest in 1987. Otherwise, he says, indexation and performance fees will keep eroding business. But money managers may face a more basic problem next year, says Richard Lannamann, executive vice president of Management Asset Inc. in Southport, Conn. &quot;The biggest challenge will be to find productive places to put money, given that we're in a pretty frothy market now. I'd say there's much more likelihood that the market will be down 20% a year from now than that it will be up 20%.&quot;    ---   Managers Had Big Gains,   But Still Lagged Indexes   Median Returns, Through Nov. 30    Equities only 20.6%    Equities and cash reserves   19.1%   Sandamp;P 500 Index 21.6%    Bonds only 14.5%    Bonds and cash reserves      14.0%   Salomon Bros. bond index 15.1%    Source: Indata   ---               The Five Largest Equity Managers   Wells Fargo Investment   Most of the San Francisco firm's assets are in indexfunds.

Return*                                           +24.3%   It was a good year for Mr. Alger, who first gained fame inthe 1960's as a &quot;go-go&quot; mutual fund manager. The New Yorkmanager's $3.5 billion of equity accounts outperformed theSandamp;P 500. Winning stock picks ranged from autos tobiotechnology. Mr. Alger even launched an ad campaignproclaiming &quot;a genius for managing money&quot; -- but consultantsquestioned the way he played up his long-term performancerecord.   Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co. L.P.   Return*                                           -10.0%   For Mr. Boesky, 1986 was a disaster. The New Yorkarbitrager raised $900 million in March from institutionaland private investors, but he had little luck playingtakeover stocks. Then came federal charges of insidertrading. His fund dumped securities, investors clamored toget out, and Mr. Boesky agreed to plead guilty to a felonycharge of securities fraud. The fund's return is estimated,based on interviews with Mr. Boesky's limited partners.   Forstmann-Leff Associates   Return*                                           +28.5%   The New York money manager continued its comeback, beatingthe Sandamp;P for the second year in a row after a difficult 1984.With $4.5 billion of assets, Forstmann-Leff emphasizeddefensive stocks in industries such as food, banking andretailing. In September, the firm agreed to be bought byBritain's Guinness Peat Group for more than $90 million.   Geewax, Terker andamp; Co.   Return*                                           +31.1%   The King of Prussia, Pa., firm used highly mathematicalevaluation methods to outperform market averages. Itspartners are former Wharton Business School instructors, whoset up their own firm in 1982. Geewax Terker, with $1.45billion in assets, is part of a boom in &quot;quant&quot; moneymanagers, so-called because of their quantitative approach.   Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts andamp; Co.   Return*                                 &quot;well above Sandamp;P&quot;   The New York firm dominated the leveraged buyout market,investing more than $2 billion for itself and institutionalpartners. KKR doesn't disclose results, but it scored big ona leveraged buyout of Beatrice Cos., as well as public stockofferings of many former LBOs. A spokesman did say the firmeasily topped the stock market's average 21.6% return.   Nomura Capital Management   Return*                                           +70.8%   The New York offshoot of Japan's Nomura Securities Co.invested its $1 billion of assets mainly in Asian markets,where conditions were ideal. Stock markets sizzled in Tokyo,Hong Kong, Singapore and other markets, while Japan's yen,the dominant currency, surged against the dollar. In general,U.S. investors in Japanese markets did nearly as well as thereturn on Nomura's benchmark Pacific Basin Fund.   Prudential Property Investment Separate Account   Return*                                           +6.96%   With $4.6 billion in assets, this Prudential Insurance Co.fund continued to be the largest single real estateportfolio. Like most real estate funds, PRISA found that aweakness in hotels, the Texas market and some office projectshurt results. But rental and lease income offset a tinyslippage in appraised values. Results are for the 12 monthsended Sept. 30.   Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark -- mortgages   Return*                                           +10.9%   New York-based Scudder Stevens ranked among the largestmanagers of mortgage-backed securities, with $8 billion ininstitutional and mutual fund accounts. Investors flocked toGinnie Maes and other mortgage-backed issues as a way toexceed Treasury yields without taking on extra credit risk.But the mortgage issues provided limited chances for capitalgains when interest rates fell. Reflecting this, ScudderStevens's benchmark AARP Ginnie Mae fund was up 10.9% throughNovember.   Robert E. Torray andamp; Co.   Return*                                            -1.0%   Mr. Torray, based in Bethesda, Md., kept most of hisclient's funds in Treasury bills, oil-service stocks andother depressed stocks, thus missing 1986's bull market. Buthe remained unrepentant, arguing that his strategy of bettingon higher oil prices and economic upheaval would ultimatelypay off. With $1.3 biliion in assets, Mr. Torray declaredlate in the year: &quot;I have no interest in buying stocks attoday's prices.&quot; Results are an estimate for the nine monthsended Sept. 30.   TSA Capital Management   Return*                                           +23.6%   The Los Angeles-based money manager was part of a growingband of &quot;asset allocators,&quot; who switched clients' money amongstocks, bonds and Treasury bills, according to computermodels of what was undervalued. TSA also was a big user ofstock and bond futures. It manages $2.1 billion overall, andits posted results reflect those accounts that can switchback and forth among multiple markets. TSA's investmentchief, Rob Arnott, says &quot;inefficiencies&quot; in the futuresmarkets helped increase returns.   *Results as of Nov. 30 unless otherwise specified.</TEXT></DOC>
