The material exhibits the photorefractive effect, apeculiar reaction of certain materials to laser light thathas been seen in a few types of crystals. But IBM scientistsat a conference here said they have produced the reaction ina polymer, not a crystal. That is important because polymers-- complex molecules with repeating patterns -- should be farcheaper to produce.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is a good first step,&quot; said Jack Feinberg, aprofessor at the University of Southern California. To makeIBM's material takes just a few hours; growing a crystaltakes two weeks.   The effect is important because it means a laser can, say,store huge amounts of data as a three-dimensional image in aphotorefractive material, by taking advantage of thedistorting effect the laser creates in the material. IBM saidit thought it could store 100 million bits of data insomething the size of a pinhead -- 25 times as much data ascan be stored in the densest fingernail-sized memory chip nowon the market. The data also could be stored and retrievedhundreds of times faster.   IBM -- which produced its material from a basic polymerand a material used in copiers and laser printers --acknowledged that the material needs to be improved muchfurther for many applications to become practical.</TEXT></DOC>
