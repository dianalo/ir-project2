The basic redundancy payterms in many organisations were introduced or revised at the heightof the recession and may now need reviewing in the light of changingexpectations about the length of working life, early retirement policies,sex discrimination law and state benefits. In this round up of redundancypay schemes the authors focus on 22 recently introduced or revised arrangements,including examples in coal and shipbuilding, where government-fundedschemes have given way to employer-led arrangements. Some of the issuescurrently affecting the redundancy pay scene are discussed, ways in whichoccupational schemes go beyond the statutory requirements on redundancypay are described.</TEXT></DOC>
