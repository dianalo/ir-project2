In three patients, the intimalflap was more obvious using the FEER sequence because of the high signalfrom blood. Thrombus in the false lumen was distinguished from bloodbecause of its low signal and zero velocity. Retrograde diastolic flowwas seen in the abdominal false lumen in one patient. This techniqueprovides important additional information in aortic disection and shouldincrease the sensitivity of its detection.</TEXT></DOC>
