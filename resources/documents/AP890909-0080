Communist Party chief Rezsoe Nyers unveiled the proposal Fridaythat includes creation of a security zone with the two neighborsthat would be free of Warsaw Pact tanks.   Nyers also said he would remove 14 of the 28 nuclear launchingpads in Hungary to reduce military costs and improve relations withthe West.   The proposal awaits formal government adoption before beingpresented to Austria and Yugoslavia, but he and other Communistleaders consulted with the two neighboring countries beforepresenting it Friday, Nyers said.   ``We consulted with Vienna and Belgrade and received favorablefeedback,'' he said during a news conference in the capital.   The reformist leader said he would ask the Soviet Union to pullout two armored battalions, 72 tanks, from a planned security zonethat Hungary envisions establishing with neutral Austria andnon-aligned Yugoslavia.   The initiative illustrates the great changes in the Soviet blocsince Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took power in 1985.   As a member of the Warsaw Pact alliance, Hungary normally acts inconcert with its six military allies. Nyers said Moscow had beenconsulted on parts of the plan that directly involve the SovietUnion, but neighboring Czechoslovakia and Romania, which also areallied, were not.   ``The present foreign policy doctrine of the Warsaw Pact allowsfor independent initiatives by member countries,'' he toldreporters. Nyers was apparently alluding to a Warsaw Pact meeting inJuly that ended with the seven member nations pledging to let eachgo their own way.   Hungary plans multiparty elections by June, the first since itbecame a Communist country. The nation is at odds with the rigidCommunist leadership of Romania and Czechoslovakia over political,ecologial and human rights issues.   Its plan to unilaterally improve military ties with itsnon-Warsaw Pact neighbors was likely to worsen tensions with thoseCommunist allies.   Nyers' proposal includes:   _Halving the number of launching pads capable of deliveringnuclear devices.   _Calling on the Soviet Union to withdraw two armored battalionsfrom a 35-mile buffer zone along common borders with Austria andYugoslavia and scrapping 200 Hungarian tanks now in the zone.   _Asking Austria and Yugoslavia to declare security zones on theirsides of the border, expanding the common buffer zone to 60 miles.   _Providing information on the size and location of forces withinthe zone.   _Limiting the frequency and size of military maneuvers andallowing military observers from the two neighboring countries toattend such exercises.   Nyers also proposes that the three countries join forces to limitand reduce military-related nuclear activities, to ban chemicalweapons, and to explore jointly cutting military expenditures.   Nyers offered no further details about the location of thenuclear launch bases or the range of missiles they could be used for.   Hungary in May removed its border fortications with Austria,allowing thousands of East bloc residents to flee to the West.Hungary, like Poland, is embarking on a wide range of liberaleconomic and political reforms and is seeking closer ties to theWest to bolster its economy.</TEXT></DOC>
