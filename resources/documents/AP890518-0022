Blond, crew-cut Scott James frequently grinned at his attorneyand District Court spectators after changing his plea Wednesday inthe Dec. 31 death of Raymond R. Lauzon.   Lawyers for both sides said they hope the boy can receivetreatment that will help him turn his life around.   ``Scott needs a lot of help and it's time he got it,'' defenseattorney Thomas Van Houten said. ``Scott needs some verysignificant intervention in his life.''   The boy, who was 11 when he set the fatal fire, will be releasedfrom custody by his 21st birthday at the latest because he wastried as a juvenile. Judge Alexander MacNichol tentatively set aMay 30 court date for determining what will be done for Scott.   Van Houten said the boy likely will need to be sent to anotherstate for treatment because Maine lacks the services he requires.   ``The focus will be on treatment, with the understanding thatsecurity will be a factor,'' Van Houten said.   ``Arson and murder certainly imply a kid who's pretty troubledand dangerous, but we hope he's salvageable,'' Assistant AttorneyGeneral Eric Wright said.   Shortly before the murder trial was to begin, the youngdefendant told the judge he started the fire.   But the boy disputed the prosecution's contention that he toldhis younger brother he wanted to see what it would be like to burnthe house and kill the man.   Wright said Scott started the fire after the 53-year-old Lauzoncaught him trying to steal some money from his wallet. Scott andhis brother, Jason, were staying in Lauzon's apartment while theirmother, Janet Sullivan, went to a pub with Lauzon's son, Ronald, onNew Year's Eve.   The judge ordered the Biddeford boy returned to the Maine YouthCenter in South Portland pending the May 30 hearing.   During the brief hearing, the judge asked the boy: ``Did youstart the fire?''   ``Yes, I did,'' the boy answered.   ``And you knew at the time you started the fire Mr. Lauzon wasupstairs in the house?'' the judge asked.   ``Yes, I did.''   ``And you knew you could hurt him?'' MacNichol asked.   ``Yes, I did.''   Scott pleaded guilty to felony murder and arson. The prosecutoragreed to drop two additional murder charges, each based ondifferent theories of what happened.</TEXT></DOC>
