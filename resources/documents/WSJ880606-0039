Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX FIN ECO </IN><G> FED </G><TEXT>   Is this the sustained rally that will pull wary investors back to the stock market, save thousands of Wall Street jobs and turn the October crash into a bad memory?    Or is it a &quot;sucker rally&quot; that will raise hopes only to dash them in a sickening plunge?    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed at 2071.30 Friday, soared 114.86 last week, the biggest point gain on record for a calendar week. While money managers, traders and market strategists generally agree on what's behind the rally, they are deeply divided about where it is heading.    &quot;This is an interest-rate rally based on the growing conviction that the Federal Reserve will not boost the discount rate,&quot; says Thom Brown, head of the investment committee at Butcher andamp; Singer in Philadelphia.    Like many other market analysts, Mr. Brown is seeing signs that the economy isn't as strong as it was thought to be only a few weeks ago. Last week, the index of leading economic indicators was up only 0.2% and May non-farm payrolls rose 209,000, somewhat less than expected.    A slower economy means the Fed need not drive interest rates higher to choke off inflation. Some now suggest that rates may even decline a little this summer.    If that happens, stock prices could continue climbing for a few months. Mr. Brown sees the Dow Jones Industrial Average going as high as 2250 over that period as a considerable amount of cash that has been on the sidelines gets committed to the market.    Stephen A. Poling, executive vice president and chief investment officer at AMEV Advisors in St. Paul, Minn., is one of the managers who may be committing some of that money. He invested one-fourth of his available cash last week as the rally began and would have put in more if the turnaround in interest-rate expectations hadn't been so sudden.    Now he's betting that rates will ease as modest economic growth and a slowdown in big takeovers cut loan demand. &quot;If rates come down, we'll commit more&quot; money to stocks, he says.    A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, says the current economic environment favors further rises in stock prices.    &quot;We're looking for slower {gross national product} growth in the second quarter, a window of improvements in interest rates and stocks more attractive than bonds,&quot; he says. &quot;As long as those factors don't change, you've got rally conditions.&quot;    Mr. Moore is figuring on second-quarter GNP growth of just 1%. That's substantially below one group's consensus forecast of about 2.5%. But then he looks for a pickup in economic activity in the third quarter that could cause some renewed weakness in stock prices.    &quot;Basically there's some potential for a resumption of inflationary pressures,&quot; he says. &quot;But as long as you have the green light for now, you should go into the market and make some money over the next few months rather than worrying about when the next recession is going to start.&quot;    Steven Einhorn, chief portfolio strategist for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., urges a more cautious approach. He has been arguing for months that the stock market is trapped in an economic box that will limit any rallies. For one thing, he isn't yet convinced the economy is slowing. And if it really is, he says, investors should think through the implications.    &quot;First, it's too early to say if the economy has lost steam and the interest-rate rise is over,&quot; he says. &quot;And if in fact the economy is losing steam, then investors will have to re-evaluate earnings expectations.&quot;    He says those expectations have risen sharply in recent weeks and probably couldn't be fulfilled in any economy weak enough to allow interest rates to fall.    &quot;Notwithstanding this bounce, I still expect the market to remain in gridlock,&quot; Mr. Einhorn says. &quot;We're enjoying some temporary relief provided by the bond market, but there's either an interest-rate toll or an earnings toll to be paid.&quot;    ---   Friday Market Activity   A late rally spurred stock prices in moderate trading.    The Dow Jones industrials were up 18.85 at 2071.30. New York Stock Exchange volume was 189.6 million shares, of which nearly 40 million came from dividend-related trading in four stocks. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 946-548.    Among blue chips, Aluminum Co. of America gained 1 1/4 to 49, Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber rose 1 1/8 to 64 7/8, International Paper was up 1 to 43 1/4, and Westinghouse closed at 54 1/2, up 1 5/8.    Abbott Laboratories slipped 1 7/8 to 45 1/8 and Bristol-Myers dropped 1 1/2 to 41 1/4 on reports that Carnation, a unit of Nestle, plans to enter the U.S. infant-formula market. Both companies derive a substantial portion of their earnings from formula sales.    Compaq Computer rose 1 3/4 to 54. Hambrecht andamp; Quist issued a buy rating on the stock and raised its estimates of the company's 1988 and 1989 earnings. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, placed Compaq on its focus list, suggesting that Goldman expects the stock to outperform the market.    Control Data advanced 1 3/8 to 26 1/2. Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock after the company held a meeting with analysts Thursday that was characterized as upbeat, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. </TEXT></DOC>
