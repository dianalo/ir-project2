 Club Net) testing facilityfor connectivity products.andP;  We left off a couple of things, though.andP;  For one,it's not easy.andP;  For another, it's not so easy.andM;You know the Club Med slogan, &quot;The antidote for civilization&quot;?andP;  Our sloganfor Club Net is &quot;The antidote for antidotes.&quot;andM;There are countless solutions for virtually every connectivity problem.andO;Unfortunately, these solutions -- the antidotes for your connectivity woes --have a knack for becoming the basis for the next problem.andM;The antidote for all these antidotes is a universal Macintosh network thatoffers seamless, transparent standards for moving information around the net.andO;But it doesn't exist.andP;  Yet.andM;The Paper ChaseandM;The ideal model for computer protocols is paper.andP;  Paper is a standardcommunications medium that works.andP;  It comes in infinite varieties to fitevery budget, every taste, every need.andP;  It supports all languages.andP;  It's easyto access, easy to create, easy for the creator or recipient to edit, easy todestroy, easy to archive.andP;  Related technologies for duplicating, scaling, anddistributing it are ever present.andP;  It's appropriate for both broadcasting(high-volume printed matter aimed at a mass audience) and narrowcasting(individually written messages for an audience of one).andM;In the electronic realm, the closest thing to a universal standard is theMIDI interface that has become ubiquitous for all electronic musicalinstruments.andP;  You can buy virtually any MIDI synthesizer with full confidencethat it will connect to all your other MIDI gear as well as to any computerequipped with a MIDI interface.andP;  But for general-purpose computing, realityis a lot more complex.andM;Now that the Mac has succeeded in Apple's goal of becoming the &quot;secondstandard&quot; of computing, Mac users no longer need to fight the competition.andO;In fact, their success often depends on how well they can cooperate withusers of other platforms.andP;  Mainframe-database access, file transfer, on-lineconnection, and all the other network-related tools of peaceful coexistenceare the key.andM;Apple is leading the industry by replacing its pro-Maczealotry-bordering-on-bigotry with a more tolerant attitude of glasnost.andP;  Thesituation parallels the coming shift in the global balance of power thatcenters around Eastern Europe's fragmentation and entry into the free marketand Western Europe's impending economic unification in 1992.andP;  While the oldguard -- the U.S.andP;  -- blithely proceeds with business as usual, the new guard-- Japan, other Pacific Rim nations, and the progressive countries withinboth Eastern and Western Europe -- are already planning for a new worldeconomy.andP;  To do business with the U.S., outsiders must learn our language andconduct business on our terms -- in other words, it's a lot like doingbusiness with IBM.andP;  Meanwhile, virtually all other industrialized countriesare already learning the diverse skills necessary for global communicationand commerce.andP;  And that's the strategy Apple is taking.andM;Another company pursuing the universal global network is a startup calledEchelon.andP;  Founded by Mike Markkula (one of the founders of Apple) andentrepreneur Ken Oshman -- with financial backing from Apple, among others --Echelon is marketing the concept of the LON (local-operating network).andM;Echelon plans to push its LonWorks communications protocol beyond computerLANs (local-area networks) to connect everything from factory equipment toconsumer electronics to the mobile network of electronics inside automobiles.andO;Sounds a bit like Ted Nelson, the Cassandra of the computer industry, who hasbeen pushing for a universal data standard (which he calls Xanadu) for almostthree decades, without success (so far).andP;  But the portfolio of strategicpartners that Echelon has amassed may give it the edge it needs to succeed.andM;When the Chips Are TaoandM;Apple is also investing in a chip-design company called Advanced RISCMachines Ltd.andP;  Although Apple hasn't said what kind of advanced RISC machinesit will build around Advanced RISC Machines' chips, similar chips have beenused for everything from workstation CPUs to controllers for microwave ovens.andM;The announcement came on the heels of Intel's media blitz for Micro 2000, thesuccessor to the '286, '386, and '486 family of chips at the heart of allPC-compatible computers.andP;  In addition to a big boost in raw computinghorsepower, Micro 2000 will feature integrated multimedia capabilities,multitasking, and speech input and output.andM;Why should you care where the chips fall?andP;  Well, although all these newtechnologies won't completely determine the fate of desktop computers in theyears to come, they do strongly restrict their direction by imposing an upperlimit on what the operating systems and application-software packages of thefuture will be able to do.andP;  The chips are a bit like the Eastern concept ofthe tao, or the &quot;way&quot; of the universe; they provide a deep infrastructurethat all the hardware and software creators must acknowledge and embrace ifthey have any hope of achieving nirvana.andM;From LAN to GamelanandM;There's another vision of the future of computers working in concert, and italso conjures up images from another corner of the globe -- namely, from theBalinese concept of the gamelan.andP;  A gamelan, according to the AmericanHeritage Dictionary, is &quot;a type of orchestra common to Southeast Asia,consisting mainly of tuned metal or wooden chimes and other percussioninstruments.&quot;andP;  But the members of a gamelan might put it differently: Thegamelan is the instrument.andP;  By itself, each performer and each sound sourceis just a voice in the wilderness.andP;  Working together, they create somethingworth hearing.andM;In the gamelan model of computing, individual computers, applications, andoperating systems will become meaningless.andP;  For any given task, a user willcall on all the elements in his gameLAN to work together to coordinate allthe elements in his information orchestra.andP;  Automatically.andM;At least, that's what Microsoft's Bill Gates is planning for.andP;  In his keynoteaddress at last fall's Comdex trade show, Gates outlined a world of&quot;information at your fingertips.&quot;andP;  In Gates' vision, the age of choosing anoperating system; selecting from a library of applications; and then,finally, creating a file of useful data is about to be stood on its head.andM;In the future, you'll start with your data.andP;  A file will no longer beformatted as the offspring of a particular piece of application software.andO;Rather, a file will comprise bits and pieces that invoke a variety ofapplications when needed.andP;  For example, suppose a page layout contains a piechart and text.andP;  When you want to edit the chart, just click on it and --instead of relying on the charting capabilities of the page-layoutapplication -- call up the full-fledged charting program of your choice.andO;Click on the text, and it calls up your word processor, not just theword-processing module within the page-layout program.andP;  If the text is inoutline form, it calls up an outliner; when you type in numbers, aspreadsheet program, statistics program, or other appropriate number cruncheris at your disposal.andM;The Waiting GameandM;When it comes to computers, the future is always sooner than we think -- butlater than we'd like.andP;  Fortunately, there's plenty of innovation coming tokeep you going until the global infotopia becomes a reality.andP;  This month'scover story on multimedia is a good place to start -- to get a jump on21st-century technology today.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
