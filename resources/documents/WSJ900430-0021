Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/30/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B6E</SO><LP>   WASHINGTON -- College social problems, such as excessivedrinking and racial tension, reflect murky standards ofconduct and administrative ambivalence about enforcing therules that do exist, a new report on campus life concludes.   The study by Ernest Boyer, president of the CarnegieFoundation for the Advancement of Teaching, comes amidgrowing reports that colleges across the country arestruggling to deal with heavy student drinking, as well aswith increases in racial and ethnic slights, includinganti-semitism.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The idyllic vision so routinely portrayed in collegepromotional materials often masks disturbing realities ofstudent life,&quot; the report contends. One reason is that &quot;onmost campuses, expectations regarding the personal conduct ofstudents are ambiguous, at best,&quot; the report says. &quot;What wefound particularly disturbing is the ambivalence collegeadministrators feel about their overall responsibility forstudent behavior.&quot;   The report cites efforts to control drinking as oneexample. The study was based in part on a survey of 382college and university presidents conducted by the foundationand the American Council on Education. In the survey, 67% ofthe presidents rated alcohol abuse as a problem on theircampuses. Many college administrators say drinkingcontributes to a number of campus problems, includingvandalism, crime and sexual harassment.   Yet many colleges don't take a firm stand against alcoholuse, even by minors. In part, that's because they wouldrather have students drink on campus than force them to drinkoff campus and then drive back.   &quot;If state laws say alcohol use is illegal for those under21, colleges should make this fact clearly known to studentsand declare that they will support the law, rather thanignore it,&quot; Mr. Boyer says, adding that students &quot;need modelsof integrity, not equivocation.&quot;   Many colleges are crafting firmer anti-drinking policies,driven in part by several well-publicized drinking-relateddeaths on campus and increasing fears of liability.   While Mr. Boyer praised these programs, his report,entitled &quot;Campus Life: In Search for Community,&quot; recommendsthat colleges and universities adopt basic principles onwhich to base their policies. The first principle, itsuggests, should be to pay more attention to education. Henotes with some despair that many students simply don't studyvery much. According to one nationwide survey, only 23% ofcollege students study 16 or more hours a week.   Other principles stress the importance of discipline,justice and open debate in campus communities.</TEXT></DOC>
