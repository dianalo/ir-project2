The trinuclear complexes in CH{sub 2}Cl{sub 2}solution bind as protonated HM{sub 3}(CO){sub 12}{sup +} cations, a reactionthat illustrates the exceptional Broensted acidity of the gallery surfaceseven at ambient temperatures. In the presence of excess physisorbed water,the gallery acidity is reduced, and the clusters bind through physicaladsorption as neutral M{sub 3}(CO){sub 12} complexes. The more weaklybasic Ir{sub 4}(CO){sub 12} cluster binds by physical adsorption, regardlessof water content. After they were aged at 25{sup 0}C or heated to 110-150{sup0}C, the gallery-bound tri-and tetranuclear clusters react with hydroxylgroups on the alumina pillar to form pillar-grafted, mononuclear ensemblesof the type [M(CO)/sub x/(OAl=){sub 2}]/sub n/ with n = 2, 3. The reactionsof H{sub 2}Os{sub 3}(CO){sub 12} and H{sub 4}Ru{sub 4}(CO){sub 12} withAPM afford the same type of grated complexes, except that H{sub 2}Os{sub3}(CO){sub 12} also forms a grafted HOs{sub 3}(CO){sub 10}(OAl=) clusteras a gallery intermediate. These grafting reactions parallel those observedon the surfaces of bulk alumina. The reduction of [HRu{sub 3}(CO){sub12}{sup +}]-APM in hydrogen affords crystalline ruthenium aggregates(andless;50 A) embedded within the clay particles. As a catalyst for Fischer-Tropsch(FT) hydrocarbon synthesis, the Ru-APM exhibits unusual selectivity towardbranched products.</TEXT></DOC>
