At the start of the Snowmass workshop, a number of physicstopics were identified which could call for a specialized detector. Themodest size of the specialized detector group dictated that we concentrateon a few of these detectors, and not try to consider all candidates.Subgroups were formed for each type of detector, and they worked completelyindependently on their very different problems. The members of a subgroupwere also members of the corresponding group within the Physics area.Because of the wide variety of problems faced by the various subgroups,the detectors will be described in separate papers within these proceedings(some of them within the Physics group reports). Thus, this report givesa summary of these designs and discusses some general considerations.</TEXT></DOC>
