Autry, 51 years old, was namedchief executive officer of Hardee's Food Systems Inc.,succeeding William E. Prather Jr., 44, who resigned &quot;todirect his career into other areas of opportunity.&quot; Mr. Autrywas president and chief executive of Fast Food MerchandisersInc., the supply arm of Hardee's.</LP><TEXT>   Imasco declined to comment on the specific reasons for Mr.Prather's departure. &quot;Obviously there was a parting of ways,&quot;a spokesman said. The spokesman said that the &quot;expansion erais over&quot; in the U.S. fast-food industry and Hardee's now&quot;requires a different kind of manager.&quot; He declined toelaborate. Hardee's has about 4,000 corporate and franchisedrestaurants with combined sales of more than $4 billion(U.S.).   Mr. Prather joined the Rocky Mount, N.C., hamburger chainas president and chief operating officer in 1986 and wasnamed chief executive last year. He couldn't be reached forcomment. Mr. Autry was an executive at a Canadianmeat-packing concern before joining Fast Food Merchandisersin 1986. Mr. Autry couldn't be reached.   Although Imasco expects Hardee's to report an operatingprofit for the second quarter, the chain operated at a lossin the latest first quarter and in the fourth quarter of 1990after years of steady profit. Imasco blamed the losses onintense competition in the fast-food industry and, to alesser extent, the recession.   Aggressive discounting by such chains as PepsiCo Inc.'sTaco Bell unit started an industrywide price war that doesn'tshow any signs of ending soon. A year ago Imasco executivessaid Hardee's wouldn't join the discount battle. But nowHardee's offers a &quot;value menu&quot; and short-term &quot;hot deals.&quot;Purdy Crawford, chairman and chief executive of Imasco,recently told analysts that &quot;price, price, price and price&quot;are what counts in today's market.   &quot;It's a real tough time for the industry,&quot; said MichaelMueller, an analyst at Montgomery Securities. &quot;The basic factis that there are too many of these (fastfood) restaurants.&quot;Dennis Lombardi, executive vice president at Technomic Inc.,food industry consultant, said that &quot;there's going to be aslow rebuilding of prices over time (but) I put the emphasison slow.&quot;   Montreal-based Imasco is a tobacco, retailing andrestaurant concern 40%-owned by Britain's B.A.T IndustriesPLC.</TEXT></DOC>
