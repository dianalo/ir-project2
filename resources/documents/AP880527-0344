Griffin, the TV talk-show host turned investor, will payapproximately $300 million for the Atlantic City, N.J., companycontrolled by New York developer Trump, the men said.   Using his profits from the deal and other funds, Trump will buyback the company's unfinished crown jewel, the vast Taj Mahalcasino in Atlantic City, for $230 million.   ``It looks like this is it,'' said Robert S. Trump, Donald'sbrother and executive vice president of The Trump Organization, ina telephone interview from New York. ``We are pleased, as I thinkMr. Griffin is pleased.''   The agreement, in contrast to a handshake deal that collapsedMay 11 amid mutual recriminations, is definitive, Robert Trump said.   The agreement calls for Trump, Resorts' chairman, to get a totalof $160 million _ $135 a share, or about $100 million, for hisClass B shares, and $60 million to terminate his managementcontract. The Class B shares, which carry special voting rights,give him 88 percent control of the company.   In addition, Griffin, through Griffin Co., agreed to payapproximately $200 million, or $36 a share, for all the company'scommon stock, Robert Trump said.   Trump agreed to pay $230 million for the Taj Mahal, a grandioseproject plagued by construction delays, and certain other assets.That purchase is subject to certain closing adjustments, RobertTrump said.   Griffin first offered to buy Resorts on March 17 for $35 a share.   After weeks of sparring, the men in April announced an agreementnearly identical to the one closed Friday, only to cancel it amonth later, with Trump accusing Griffin of failing to line upfinancing and Griffin accusing Trump of seeking last-minute changes.</TEXT></DOC>
