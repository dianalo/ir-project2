An accelerating round of profit-taking wiped out the gainsin Treasury bond prices that occurred Tuesday in the wake ofthe Federal Reserve's decision to cut the discount rate.Yesterday's profit-taking came despite yet another Fed moveto lower interest rates.</LP><TEXT>   The central bank again cut the federal funds rate, whichbanks charge one another for overnight loans, this time to 7%from 7 1/4%. Still, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bondlost more than 1 1/8 points, or more than $11.25 for each$1,000 of face amount.   But the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended unchanged at2626.73 after wandering aimlessly all day. The dollarrebounded from the drubbing it took Tuesday, while goldprices posted an unexpected increase. Traders said the$9.50-per-ounce gain was mostly a response to stepped-up goldbuying in the Middle East.   Analysts said bond traders had already bid prices higheron speculation that the Fed would continue to aggressivelypush down interest rates as the economy deteriorates. Whenthe Fed announced the discount-rate cut Tuesday, some tradersbegan to sell into the big bond rally. And when it becameevident yesterday that the Fed had once again cut the federalfunds rate, that was enough to persuade more bondholders tosell before the expected lethargic trading of the holidayseason takes over.   The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed chargesmember financial institutions for loans. A change in the rateis a powerful symbol that the Fed is moving to stimulate theeconomy with lower rates.   &quot;Speculators saw a reward for their correct anticipationthat the Fed would ease, and they chose to take their profitsrather than carry them over into the new year,&quot; said BrianFabbri, chief economist for Midland Montagu in New York.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices were unchanged. Volume on the New York StockExchange totaled 180.4 million shares. Advancing issues onthe Big Board were ahead of losers 854 to 712.                                                                                                          Bond prices slumped. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark30-year issue climbed to 8.17%.                                                                                                          The dollar gained.
