(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actor Patrick Swayze, who starred in lastyear's hit ``Dirty Dancing,'' is making a new movie about a feudbetween a Kentucky family and Chicago mobsters.   Swayze plays a Chicago policeman who joins his Appalachianfamily in exacting vengeance from gangsters responsible for themurder of his brother.   Hardburly, a former coal camp in eastern Perry County, was oneof several locations the 70-member team from Lorimar Pictures Inc.descended upon last week.   In Jackson, enthusiastic crowds watched the production team whipup billows of smoke for a scene in which Swayze boards a train forChicago.   The production team and its members also made local merchantshappy, spending $500,000 to $1 million, said Bert Harberson, aneconomic development representative with the Kentucky Film Office.
