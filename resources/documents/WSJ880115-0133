Biden argues in his Jan. 7 letter that, in contrast to Judge Bork, Judge Kennedy takes an expansive and activist view of the Ninth Amendment. As the Journal's editorial of the same date persuasively demonstrates, however, Sen. Biden had misinterpreted Judge Kennedy's testimony. More significant, the senator's letter evinces a fundamental misunderstanding of the Ninth Amendment.    Adherents of Sen. Biden's view generally contend that the Ninth Amendment is an open-ended provision, evidencing the existence of unenumerated rights that trump enumerated federal powers (or state powers) where the two come in conflict. This, they argue, allows the courts to divine rights unmentioned in the Constitution, like the right of privacy, and apply them against the state and federal governments. This view, however, in the words of Justices Stewart and Black, &quot;turn{s} somersaults with history&quot; and with the language of the amendment.    By its plain language, the Ninth Amendment is not a substantive grant of rights, but a rule of construction (&quot;enumeration . . . of certain rights . . . shall not be construed&quot;). To be sure, the amendment does imply that unenumerated rights of the people were retained when the Constitution was adopted; however, those rights are defined by subtracting from the original sovereignty of the people the powers delegated to the federal government. By definition, then, the rights retained cannot conflict with or trump the delegated powers.    Moreover, the use of the word &quot;retained&quot; implies that the rights protected were those that had not been delegated to the federal government upon its formation. In the late 18th century, rights were often understood to be &quot;powers reserved&quot; to individuals; i.e., that an individual right was the opposite of a governmental power.    As Judge Kennedy and others have explained, the Ninth Amendment was adopted out of concern that the specification of certain rights (i.e., powers reserved) might give rise to the implication that all other powers (not merely the delegated powers) had been delegated to the federal government. In keeping with this concern, Madison's initial draft provided that &quot;{t}he exceptions . . . made in favor of particular rights&quot; not be construed &quot;to diminish the just importance of other rights retained by the people&quot; or &quot;to enlarge the powers delegated by the constitution&quot; but &quot;as actual limitations of such power, or as inserted merely for greater caution.&quot; The language was later shortened to refer only to rights retained, and in this form the amendment passed and was ratified.    In Virginia, Gov. Randolph opposed the amendment, arguing that it was impossible to determine which rights were retained, and that the amendment &quot;should operate rather as a provision against extending the powers of Congress by their own authority, than as a protection to rights reducible to no definitive certainty.&quot; Madison responded that the distinction was &quot;altogether fanciful. If a line can be drawn between the powers granted and the rights retained, it would seem to be the same thing, whether the latter be secured, by declaring that they shall not be abridged, or that the former shall not be extended.&quot;    The Ninth Amendment, then, like the 10th, was adopted to emphasize that ours is a federal government of limited powers. It has no limiting effect at all on the powers of the states. Indeed, the amendment was, in Judge Kennedy's words, &quot;a recognition of state sovereignty and a recognition of state independence and . . . of the role of the states in defining human rights.&quot; Its language and history simply do not support the activist view of the amendment as empowering the courts to &quot;discover&quot; unenumerated rights in the Constitution to invalidate otherwise validly enacted federal or state laws.
