Theliterature describing this disease is breafly reviewed. This tumor isa rare entity, but exhibits a variety of pathological profiles. It isrelatively benign in nature, usually found after it has grown to a largesize because of its gradual growth and mild symptoms. The ratio of thistumor to all the brain tumors has been increased with increasing incidentalfindings of asymptomatic cases on routine CT scans. Craniotomy is thetreatment of choice. However, meticulous operative technique and selectionof appropriate approach are required to allow the brain to be retractedminimally and the feeding arteries controlled in an early stage of theprocedure, and hence minimize postoperative neurological deficit. Inmost cases, surgery for a total resection can be performed with goodprognosis and little chance of recurrence, if a risk of incidents suchas bleeding at surgery, postoperative hemorrhage, and neurological deficitis evaded. We consider that this disease should be distinguished fromparalateral ventricle tumors in the aspects of therapy and prognosis.</TEXT></DOC>
