DICKERSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Helene's winds dipped below hurricane strengthFriday as it lost its tropical characteristics, evolving asexpected into a 600-mile-wide storm in the far North Atlantic.   ``We like to call them `extratropical.' The whole deal is, in ahurricane the maximum winds are concentrated in a small area nearthe eye. In extratropicals, the winds are spread out over hundredsof miles,'' said National Hurricane Center expert Max Mayfield.   At noon EDT Friday, Helene was centered about 460 milessouth-southwest of Reykjavik, Iceland. Top sustained winds wereabout 70 mph as the storm moved north-northeast near 45 mph.   In tropical systems, fierce winds revolve around warm cores oflow pressures. In Helene's case, ``it's becoming cold-core,''Mayfield said.   ``Eventually, it'll lose strength and that'll be the last ofit,'' he said, adding that the hurricane center would no longermonitor the storm. ``It's getting (so far north) we can't even seeit on the satellite.''   Meanwhile, the 16th tropical depression of the 1988 Atlantichurricane season was about 335 miles east-southeast of Barbados atnoon, moving northwest at 10 to 15 mph. Forecasters said it mightstrengthen.   The poorly organized depression's top winds were 35 mph, and itwas expected to drench the Windward Islands late Friday.   Depressions receive named tropical storm status when winds hit39 mph, and become hurricanes when winds reach 74 mph.   Helene, the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season, was bornlast week near the Cape Verde Islands off west Africa. It's windspeaked with 140 mph before the storm veered north and lost steam.   The six-month hurricane season started June 1 and ends Nov. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
