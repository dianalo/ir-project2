NetWare 3.10 local area network, which theyexpect will solve that problem of finding visual materials quickly.andM;Drizd said the prototype system his staff put in, using document managementsoftware from SoftSolutions Technology Corp., can be expanded to make allkinds of electronic files -- &quot;text, forms, templates, spreadsheets, whateveryou want to put in there&quot; -- easier to find and retriever.andM;The menu-driven software that takes thousands of electronic documents,indexes them and makes them easy to find has its roots in Orem, Utah, theheadquarters for SoftSolutions.andP;  It uses the same search algorithm that theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses to index and retrieve itsvast repository of genealogical records.andM;NCHS has the document management software, SoftSolution Advanced 2.0, runningon a dedicated IBM Corp. PS/2 Model 80 A31 server with 300M of hard-drivestorage available.andP;  Depending on how many employees the center allocates tothe task, it could have 2,000 slides on the server by the end of the year,Drizd said.andM;Somebody, of course, will have to copy the center's vast collection ofHarvard Graphics files onto the NetWare server set up for that purpose, thenfill in profile screens for each visual document.andP;  The profile screens becomepart of the database and make it easy when someone wants to find those samefiles later to copy to his own PC hard drive.andM;SoftSolution's document management software does both query-by-examplesearches and full-text searches to locate any character-based or bit-mappeddocument.andM;Automated archiving, document-level security, 70-character file names,multiple version tracking and compound document management under one documentprofile are all features of SoftSolution Advanced.andM;The system automatically synchronizes a document's profile and its physicallocation when documents are renamed or transferred.andM;SoftSolution also builds a directory path for each document, based oninformation a system administrator types into each document profile screen,and automatically launches the WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, Harvard Graphicsor Lotus 1-2-3 program needed to edit the document.andM;The C language software runs under MS-DOS or Unix and on any LAN server withMS--DOS-level file sharing and file locking.andM;&quot;While the SoftSolution product is meant to be a dynamic thing,&quot; Drizd said,&quot;we're anticipating using it entirely as a reference library,&quot; withindividual curators to be responsible for forms, regulations and whateverdocuments NCHS eventually stores on that server.andM;SoftSolution requires both server and individual station licenses.andP;  On theGeneral Services Administration Schedule, a server license for SoftSolutionAdvanced is slightly more than $1,000, and each station license is about$150.andP;  Both Isyx LAN Systems Inc. of Rockville, Md., and Fedmark of Kingston,Md., resell SoftSolution on the GSA Schedule.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
