RAM is designed insuch a way that erratic detector signals are recognized very efficientlyand can be eliminated from the experimental data set: this is achievedby modal expansion of the difference between theoretical fluxes and experimentalfluxes at the detector sites. Sensitivity studies have shown that RAMis quite stable, does not absorb the 'wild' detector errors in the mappingprocedure and results in mapped fluxes with errors about three timessmaller than would be obtained by direct interpolation of detector readings.</TEXT></DOC>
