Jandamp;J claims that its peat moss pad provides the sameabsorbency but is one-fifth as thick as standard sanitarypads, which have a core of fluffed wood pulp. Jandamp;J also claimsits peat pad is slightly thinner and performs better than&quot;ultra thin&quot; pads that rely on superabsorbent polymers, atechnology that revolutionized the disposable-diaper market.The superabsorbent polymers gel as they absorb liquid.</LP><TEXT>   Jandamp;J won't say if or when its peat pad, named Sure andamp;Natural Prima in Canada, will be introduced in the U.S. andother markets. &quot;At this point, we won't speculate about whatthose plans might be,&quot; a Jandamp;J spokesman said. Sure andamp; NaturalPrima is just now hitting store shelves here and Jandamp;J hasn'tstarted advertising yet. Jandamp;J also won't discuss otherpossible uses for the processed peat moss, such as disposablediapers, a market the company abandoned 10 years ago.   Told of the peat pad, industry executives and analystswere intrigued. &quot;If they can really reduce thickness byone-fifth with the same absorbency, wow, they're goingplaces,&quot; said an industry researcher who studies absorbentmaterials. &quot;You're kidding,&quot; a spokesman at a Jandamp;J competitorsaid.   But analysts and executives said Jandamp;J could have a toughtime marketing the product. The sphagnum, or peat moss, coreof Sure andamp; Natural Prima is visible through the pad's whiteouter linings as a dark, rectangular middle layer. Aftercutting the pad open, the curious will discover that theprocessed moss is light brown, dry and crumbly.   A manager at a company that makes private-label sanitarypads and napkins said consumers may spurn the product becauseof the dark middle layer. &quot;I wouldn't buy a brown sanitarynapkin,&quot; said Bonita Austin, a Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co.analyst, adding that getting consumers to try any newsanitary pad is difficult. &quot;This is the kind of product womenjust don't want to take a risk on,&quot; she said.   The industry scientist said that other researchers whohave studied peat moss found that bleaching it to increasewhiteness reduced absorbency. Jandamp;J won't say much about itspeat process. The moss is &quot;compressed into rolls or mats,&quot;the Jandamp;J spokesman said, adding that it isn't bleached. Hedeclined to elaborate. He said the processed moss can absorb20 times its weight in liquid. Sure andamp; Natural Prima is thefirst commercial application of Jandamp;J's patented peat mosstechnology, which was developed by the company'sMontreal-based Canadian unit. Jandamp;J is based in New Brunswick,N.J.   Acknowledging that it isn't easy to get women to try a newpad and to convince them that a very thin pad will work, thespokesman said Jandamp;J plans extensive free sampling. He wouldn'tdiscuss the marketing plan in detail but said the mainselling points are highlighted on the Sure andamp; Natural Primabox and in an enclosed pamphlet. &quot;So thin, so close tonothing,&quot; the box reads, promising &quot;incredible protection.&quot;   However, Sure andamp; Natural Prima's most innovative featureisn't part of the sales pitch. The package doesn't mentionpeat moss. The enclosed pamphlet says only that the &quot;unique,highly absorbent core {is} from nature.&quot; A woman callingJandamp;J's Canadian consumer information line was told thematerial is &quot;natural.&quot; After asking twice what that meant,she was finally told, &quot;okay, it's sphagnum moss.&quot;   Analysts said Jandamp;J has been losing market share to Procterandamp; Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp. in the key U.S. padmarket and needs a boost. Wertheim Schroder estimatesKimberly-Clark has 30%; Jandamp;J, 29%; and Pandamp;G, 26%, of the U.S.sanitary-pad market. Canadian market shares weren'tavailable. The U.S. market is worth $1.9 billion at retailand the Canadian market, $235 million. The world-widesanitary-napkin market is estimated at $8 billion. Figuresdon't include tampons.   Jandamp;J processes its moss at a mill in Desbiens, Quebec, asmall town 225 miles north of Montreal. The region is knownfor blueberries and bogs. Quebec has abundant supplies ofpeat moss.</TEXT></DOC>
