Kaunda told reporters that when he met recently with PresidentF.W. de Klerk of South Africa, ``He said he was against apartheid,he said he was going to work to remove it.   ``Whether he will succeed, I do not know. We want to see if heis going to push his parliament to abolish apartheid. If he doesnot, then the Security Council should invoke mandatory sanctions.''   Kaunda and Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe gave keynoteaddresses at Tuesday's opening of the General Assembly's firstSpecial Session on Apartheid.   The United States or Britain has always used its veto power toprevent the Security Council from imposing mandatory sanctions onSouth Africa, except for a 1977 ban on arms trade with that country.   They contend economic sanctions harm the black majority theremore than the white minority, and that the international communitycan better influence Pretoria if it does not isolate the country.   Black African nations and the African National Congress, themain guerrilla group fighting to end white domination in SouthAfrica, demand comprehensive sanctions.   A General Assembly call for all nations to sever economic,military, sports and cultural links with South Africa has met withpartial success.   South Africa usually seems to find ways to obtain petroleum andother vital resources, though at higher than market cost.   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told the openingsession the assembly's longstanding opposition to apartheid ``issquarely based on the universally shared perception that theinstitution of apartheid constitutes a threat to internationalpeace and security.''   South Africa's seats in the assembly were vacant throughout thedebate.   The General Assembly in 1974 suspended South Africa'sparticipation and voting in the assembly because it refused to obeythe world body's calls to abolish apartheid.   South African apartheid has established a racially segregatedsociety in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
