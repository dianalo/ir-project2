RIORDAN is a 59-year-old lawyer, investmentbanker, restaurateur, real estate man and venture capitalistwith a passion for education. He wants every child to bereading and writing in the first grade. &quot;If children cannotdo that,&quot; he says, &quot;we have lost them for life.&quot;   His efforts have been applied to more than 500 schools and50,000 five- and six-year-olds and he is now helping to putthe system into every elementary school in Mississippi, astate laboring under an appalling illiteracy rate.   Mr. Riordan's crusade was sparked by a 1983 CarnegieFoundation report arguing that language was the key to alllearning and that children should master it by the fourthgrade at the latest. After exploring what schools were doing,Mr. Riordan concluded that computers could help achieve thatgoal.   At first, the Riordan Foundation, the vehicle used for theLos Angeles lawyer's philanthropies, concentrated onparochial schools in that city. Mr. Riordan is educationchairman for the archdiocese of Los Angeles and thanks to hisfund-raising efforts, 103 of its 200 parochial schools nowhave a computerized learning system in which children andpersonal computers &quot;talk&quot; to each other, letting childrenwrite the words they can say and read the words they canwrite.   Public schools have been added to the program and it hasnow spread to New York, Trenton, N.J., Orange County, Calif.,and Kansas City, Mo. Mr. Riordan's role has been to combinehis own funds with those of local sources to finance theprograms.   Mississippi's statewide program is Mr. Riordan's mostambitious by far. This phase began after the state's41-year-old governor, Raymond Mabus, met Mr. Riordan while onan industry-promotion tour in California and invited him tothe Executive Mansion for lunch. The governor has big plansfor education in Mississippi and thecomputer-in-the-classroom approach, dubbed Writing-to-Read,is part of them.   Mr. Riordan's approach is to act as a catalyst, putting uphis own money but raising the ante by enlisting the aid ofothers with similar views. For the Mississippi program, heput up $1 million. He then called on Robert Dowling, a NewYork entrepreneur who has been a close friend sincegrade-school days in New Rochelle, N.Y. Mr. Dowling respondedwith a $500,000 gift of his own. Mr. Riordan also pledged toraise $5.5 million more over four years.   The privately raised money went to International BusinessMachines Corp., which installed 72 Writing-to-Read labs in 60schools during the summer of 1989, a job that entailed notonly computers but new electrical outlets, desks, securitydevices, lettered tiles for word-making, and a host of otheritems. By the time the 1989 fall terms began, theWriting-to-Read program was a fact. The goal is to have itworking in all 532 Mississippi grade schools by 1993.   Mr. Riordan's lunch with Gov. Mabus and the program itproduced did not go unnoticed. The lawyer has had calls fromthe governors of Louisiana, Indiana and West Virginia askingfor help in developing their own computer programs. TheRiordan Foundation has also held meetings with businessgroups from Arkansas and Chicago.   For Richard Riordan and his partners, the interest of thebusiness groups is especially gratifying. &quot;Illiteracy is notonly evil and sinful,&quot; Mr. Riordan says, &quot;it is extremely badbusiness.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
