Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev condemned SaddamHussein and laid the blame for the war on the Iraqipresident's refusal to pull out of Kuwait.</LP><TEXT>   But Mr. Gorbachev mainly emphasized that the Soviet Unionhad &quot;done everything in its power to resolve the conflict bypeaceful means,&quot; including a last-minute effort to reachSaddam Hussein to urge a withdrawal from Kuwait. The U.S.gave Moscow one-hour advance notice of the attack, a Sovietofficial said.   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, speaking after anemergency meeting in Paris of the European Community'sforeign and defense ministers, said Saddam Hussein hadbrought the attack on himself. &quot;Saddam Hussein remained muteand walled himself in with his own intransigence,&quot; Mr. Dumassaid. &quot;History will judge this comportment.&quot;   Mr. Dumas also stressed the importance of the allies'behavior once the war was over. Peace would only come to theMiddle East, he said, after a conference devoted to all theregion's fundamental problems, a linkage the U.S. rejects.   France refused to take part in the attack on Iraqiterritory, limiting its air strikes to Iraqi targets withinKuwait. Though they expressed annoyance, U.S. and Britishofficials said the French position won't weaken the allianceor affect military operations.   Some U.S. officials speculated that France is trying tocalm popular resistance to its involvement in the war. Pollssuggest that most French citizens would prefer that Francestay out of the fighting entirely. Defense MinisterJean-Pierre Chevenement has made no secret of his oppositionto the war.   This continuing division within the coalition &quot;hashighlighted the many problems of European unity,&quot; saidSpanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez. &quot;It ismore important than ever that Europe establish its ownEuropean defense identity.&quot;   Meanwhile, the Turkish Parliament yesterday authorized theuse of air bases in Turkey for attacks on Iraq by U.S.warplanes. Until now, Turkey -- the only country in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization that shares a border with Iraq-- had said it would only act in self-defense against itsneighbor. Opposition parties voted against the measure,saying it would drag Turkey into war with Saddam Hussein.   In Tokyo, the Japanese government, eager to defuseoverseas criticism of its small role in the Persian Gulfcrisis, said it stands ready &quot;to extend maximum possible&quot;financial and other nonmilitary contributions. But officialsdidn't say how much money might be forthcoming. In atelevised address, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu pledgedJapan's &quot;firm support to the use of force&quot; to drive Iraq fromKuwait.   Leaders of Japanese business associations called on thegovernment to quickly provide more support for themultinational coalition against Iraq. Several prominentruling-party officials sounded a similar message. In atelephone interview, Muneo Suzuki, parliamentary vice foreignminister, said Japan &quot;is the biggest beneficiary&quot; of peace inthe Gulf, so should &quot;do its utmost.&quot;   Geopolitical experts in Europe said postwar actions shouldbe based, above all, on preserving Iraq intact in itspre-Kuwait borders. &quot;It's important that this be the defeatof a man, not a country,&quot; said Dominique Moisi, deputydirector of the French Institute for International Relations.   European governments unanimously blamed the war on SaddamHussein, and said he could end it by surrendering. ItalianForeign Minister Gianni De Michelis said, &quot;The hope is thatSaddam Hussein understands, and will take the step that hehasn't taken so far,&quot; for peace. He described the attack as&quot;a true police operation, conducted with surgical precision,to hit military objectives.&quot;   The Italian Parliament voted yesterday to authorize theuse of the country's small air and naval forces in the Gulf.Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti said its 10 Tornadofighter-bombers, which have been stationed in Turkey, will besent to a desert base in the United Arab Emirates under U.S.operational command. Italy also has six naval ships and morethan 1,000 naval personnel on station in the Gulf. But Italywon't send in additional troops.   Italy, with no nuclear program and few natural energyresources, is particularly vulnerable to oil-pricefluctuations, and will be a big beneficiary if a short warleads to better supplies and lower prices. More than half itstotal energy needs are met by imported oil, with 34% of itsimported crude coming from the Mideast.   Economists believe the Gulf crisis has already had animpact on Italian business, although as much in psychologicalas direct economic terms. The Italian economy was alreadyweakening before the invasion of Kuwait, but the Gulf crisisacted as a catalyst in forcing businesses to modify theirinvestment plans.   Most European countries beefed up security andanti-terrorist measures, but jitters persisted. At NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Brussels, asmall, white civilian aircraft that made several circles inthe sky over the grounds had guards jumping out of theirtrucks to watch it. It turned out to be harmless.   The German reaction was probably the most emotional -- andcomplicated. Germany hasn't sent troops to the Gulf, and U.S.congressmen have begun to complain over the size and speed ofthe country's financial contribution. The hesitation isevident all over Germany.   Germany has produced some of the most widespread andintense anti-war demonstrations in recent days, recalling aperiod in the early 1980s when Germans by the thousands wentonto the streets to protest the stationing of nuclear weaponsin their country. &quot;In Germany, it's impossible to make waracceptable, even as a last resort,&quot; says Meinhard Miegel,managing director of Bonn's Institute for Economic and SocialResearch, an independent think tank.   In a telephone poll conducted earlier this week by aGerman broadcasting company, nearly 80% of those surveyedsaid they opposed using military force against Iraq.   There was also some German embarrassment, which reached tothe chancellor's office, where Chancellor Helmut Kohl's firstreaction shortly after the attack wasn't of praise for theAmericans but of sorrow for the victims. &quot;The chancellorwanted to do more for George Bush all along,&quot; says one seniorGerman official. &quot;But it just wasn't possible politically. Heis disappointed he couldn't do more, especially after all thehelp George Bush gave him with unification. He feels apersonal debt to George Bush that he couldn't repay in thiscase.&quot;   Much will depend on how the U.S. follows up politically.Bonn officials now expect Washington to try to convince theArabs that the U.S. was fighting for them as well byproposing a far-reaching peace conference that will includethe Palestinian issue.   However, German officials fear that the net result of thewar would be more tensions with the U.S. They fear that U.S.congressmen will hold a grudge against Germany for not beingmore helpful.   &quot;I understand that the Americans are upset about the lackof German involvement,&quot; said Uwe Nehrlich, a German politicalexpert. &quot;But my great worry is that, in part understandably,Congress and parts of the American public will react toGerman failure to deliver in the crisis in a way that willalso set in motion negative reaction on German side.&quot;   In Britain, Washington's most ardent European ally sincethe Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, Prime Minister JohnMajor, while clearly buoyed by the success of the initialallied raids, declined to predict a quick end to theconflict. But he said that the allied position is to offer noquarter to Saddam Hussein.   Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she was&quot;relieved&quot; that the allies had finally struck and flatlyblamed the attack on Saddam Hussein. She said the war startedthe day Saddam marched into Kuwait: &quot;These people {theKuwaitis} have been subjected to brutality, looting andplunder on an appalling scale, and so far there has been noone there to defend them.&quot;   In Spain, Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalezreiterated his support of the international forces, but hismain concern has been to assure Spaniards that the countrywon't enter the war. Nor will it send reinforcements to theGulf, where three Spanish ships are providing logisticsupport to the allied troops. Opposition parties and unionsare asking for the ships' return, arguing that Spanish troopswere sent to the Gulf to enforce the embargo and not tofight.</TEXT></DOC>
