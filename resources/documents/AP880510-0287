(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.says it has asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to authorizeKCSI, and not the Denver Rio Grande Western Railway, to acquire andoperate the Southern Pacific Transportation Co.   The application was based on the belief that it would be in thebest public interest for KCSI to own Southern Pacific, said LandonRowland, president and chief executive officer of KCSI, on Monday.   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corporation has been required by theICC to divest the Southern Pacific because a merger between it andthe Santa Fe Railway would have essentially ended railroadcompetition in the Southwest and other markets served by the tworailroads, Rowland said.   ``Santa Fe Southern Pacific chose to sell the Southern Pacificto Denver Rio Grande, rather than to Kansas City Southern, for whatwe believe to be purely anti-competitive reasons,'' he said.   KCSI's operating plan, filed Monday with the ICC, calls for thepurchase of 547 modern locomotives over the next five years.   ``In contrast, the Philip F. Anschutz interests, which controlthe Denver Rio Grande, appear to treat the acquisition as primarilya real estate play, and propose to buy only 40 new locomotives overessentially the same period,'' he said.   Samuel R. Freeman, the Rio Grande's vice president and generalcounsel, said his company wouldn't neglect the Southern Pacific. Itwould lease most new equipment instead of buying it to capitalizeon financial and tax benefits, Freeman said.   The Rio Grande runs across about 1,900 miles, from Kansas Cityto Utah. It hasn't revealed details for combining its small localwork force with that of the Southern Pacific, which has about 280employees.   Monday was the deadline for comments about the SouthernPacific's proposed sale to be filed with regulators.   Also opposing the deal were Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft and theMissouri Highway and Transportation Commission.   Freeman said the Rio Grande's purchase was backed by mostshippers, regulators and other railroads.   The ICC expects to rule in mid-August on the sale plan.   Regulators last June killed Santa Fe Southern Pacific's effortsto merge the Southern Pacific with the Rio Grande Railway, which italso owns. They feared that a merger of the two big lines, whosetracks overlap in many areas, would stifle competition and increaseshipping rates.   Early last year Kansas City Southern began a furious campaign tobuy the Southern Pacific. But the lobbying didn't prevent Santa FeSouthern Pacific from naming the Rio Grande as the railroad's buyerin late December.</TEXT></DOC>
