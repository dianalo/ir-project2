Bulkeleyquotes newsletter-article publisher Esther Dyson, saying thatsoftware-industry opinion &quot;has shifted dramatically toward protection ofintellectual property&quot;, in support of his assertion that many softwaredevelopers have &quot;come around to Lotus' position&quot;.andP;  The same Journal articlecontains a flat prognostication by Technology Law Bulletin publisher Lee T.andO;Gesmer that &quot;based on the legal precedents to date, we predict victory forLotus.&quot;andM;Well, perhaps.andP;  I'll make no forecast as to the outcome, but I will statethat based upon what I know about the judge assigned to theproceedings--District Judge Robert Keeton, who, previous to his appointmentto the federal bench, was a Harvard Law School professor--any dramatic shiftin industry opinion, if indeed there has been one, is likely to make preciouslittle difference.andP;  Instead, I would expect that the judge's decision,whatever it may be, will turn merely on the application of pertinent legalconcepts to the facts brought out during the course of the trial.andP;  Andthere's one important variable that shouldn't be overlooked: sometimeslawyers for one side simply do a better job of presenting evidence to thecourt than do their opponents.andM;In the meantime, though, it appears that Judge Keeton has dealt a mortal blowto a related look-and-feel suit brought by SAPC Inc. against Lotus.andP;  SAPC isthe successor company to Software Arts, the originator of VisiCalc, and hadclaimed that Lotus 1-2-3 itself constituted an infringement of its copyrighton the look and feel of VisiCalc.andP;  However, the judge ruled that theacquisition by Lotus in 1985 of Software Arts' assets effectively transferred&quot;all pre-existing causes of action for copyright infringement&quot; to Lotus,rendering SAPC's look-and-feel claim moot.andM;On the opposite coast, another major package of look-and-feel litigationpending in the federal court in San Francisco has hit a snag.andP;  I'm referring,of course, to what has become a four-way controversy involving Apple,Microsoft and its licensee, Hewlett-Packard, and--now--Xerox Corp. Initiatedby Apple's suit filed in March, 1988 claiming that Microsoft and HP hadillegally appropriated the Macintosh user interface for MS Windows and HP NewWave software, the lawsuit initially bogged down in wranging overdisqualification of one of the law firms representing Apple, and later overApple's motion to disqualify the judge who was hearing the case.andP;  Althoughthe judge refused to step down from handling the suit, and instead scheduledAugust 14, 1989 as the trial date, the matter was abruptly reassigned justone month afterwards to Judge William Schwarzer.andM;For the new judge, the first order of business was to tackle the criticalpreliminary rulings concerning the effect on the case of a licensingagreement for Windows 1.0 that Apple and Microsoft had entered into back in1985.andP;  The judge's decision in March, 1989 that this agreement did not giveMicrosof a blanket license for use of the Macintosh visuals was widely viewedas a first solid victory for Apple.andP;  But in the next round in June, Appledidn't fare as well.andP;  Ruling that the licensing agreement covered not onlyWindows 1.0 but also extended to features in subsequent versions of theprogram, Judge Schwarzer essentially left only the use of overlapping windowsand of particular icons as areas in dispute.andP;  In short, the overall look andfeel of the user interface was no longer an issue.andM;The real bombshell in these proceedings struck this past February when JudgeSchwarzer announced he was taking a leave of absence from the bench to headthe Federal Judicial Center in Washington, DC.andP;  His entire caseload--over 400lawsuits in all--was reassigned to a newly appointed judge, Vaughan Walker.andM;&quot;Well, so what?&quot;, some readers may be thinking.andP;  The central problem is this:neither of Judge Schwarzer's preliminary rulings constitutes a finaldecision.andP;  Such rulings are exactly what the name implies--preliminaryholdings that set the stage for the conduct of the actual trial by definingthe subject matter that will be relevant in deciding the controversy.andP;  Theserulings largely determine what evidence the judge will allow the parties topresent during the course of the trial--setting, in essence, the directionthe lawsuit is going to take.andM;Since preliminary rulings are merely the way the underbrush is cleared sothat the trial can proceed, they normally can't be appealed until the wholetrial has been completed and the final decision handed down.andP;  Then, ofcourse, the losing party can ask an appellate court to set the entireproceedings aside on the basis that the trial judge goofed in making acrucial preliminary ruling.andM;Judges don't especially relish being reversed on appeal, and so they want tobe as sure as possible that their preliminary rulings will survive an attackby the losing party.andP;  For this reason, prudence dictates that Judge Walker gothrough the same steps Judge Schwarzer did, even if he ends up going alongwith his predecessor's views regarding the legal effect of the Windows 1.0licensing agreement.andP;  This in itself will mean a delay--and then if you throwin the fact that the new judge suddenly has 400-odd lawsuits to get on topof, it could be quite a delay.andP;  (I've been in this position myself, and Icertainly don't envy Judge Walker.)andM;As if this weren't enough, the situation was complicated further lastDecember when Xerox filed suit against Apple, alleging that Apple had rippedoff its Macintosh interface from the Star workstation developed earlier atXerox's Palo Alto Research Center.andP;  Xerox faces a problem in its lawsuitbecause it waited so long to take legal action--there's a doctrine barringrecovery to those who've slept on their rights, known as laches--andapparently is putting most of its reliance on a claim that Apple has engagedin unfair business practices in marketing the Macintosh as its own creation.andO;It should be noted that even if Xerox's legal position seems weak, somecompanies have thought enough of the potential in Xerox's ownership claims tohave quietly obtained licenses from Xerox--including ATandamp;T, Sun, and, morerecently, Metaphor Computer Systems.andM;And who's the judge who has this hot potato in his newly acquired caseload?andO;You guessed it--Judge Walker.andM;However long it may take for the Apple lawsuits to finally come to trial andbe decided, it's important to remember that the resulting decisions won'thave a lot of clout as legal precedent, because they will be made at thetrial-court level.andP;  They won't be binding in any other court--only appellatecourt decisions enjoy that status--although if they're thought to bewell-reasoned they may be considered persuasive by other judges.andP;  The samething is of course true of the decision Judge Keeton will be making in theLotus 1-2-3 litigation.andM;If recent experience is a guide, the industry may have to be content withthis situation, since lawsuits that at first appeared to have potential forcreating landmark legal precedents in software law have tended to wash out atthe district-court level.andP;  At the time I wrote about NEC Corp. vs.andP;  IntelCorp. (see Vol.andP;  7 No.andP;  4), it was still unclear whether an appeal from thedistrict judge's decision would be filed.andP;  Once again, however, the partiesdeemed it best to settle their differences quietly, not only forgoing therisks of appeal, but also pulling the plug on a still-pending claim of unfaircompetition by NEC against Intel.andM;The outcome of the NEC-Intel litigation would probably have been different,by the way, had the events in question occurred after the change in the UScopyright laws that took effect as of March 1, 1989, effectively doing awaywith the requirement of a copyright notice.andP;  Intel had neglected to place anotice on some three million chips, which led the judge to conclude that thecompany had forfeited its right to copyright protection.andP;  But even though thedecision was made at the district-court level, it remains interesting for itsanalysis leading to the judge's conclusion that NEC had not copied Intel'scode, and especially for its statement that &quot;copying [that is] deleted or sodisguised as to be unrecognizable is not copying&quot;.andM;Contrast this language with an earlier district-court decision we discussedback in 1987 (see Vol.andP;  5 No.andP;  4), SAS Institute, Inc. vs.andP;  S andamp; H ComputerSystems, Inc.andP;  In that imbroglio, defendant S andamp; H had deceptively obtained alicense that gave it access to source code for SAS's IBM-compatible EBCDICstatistical-analysis program, and converted it to VAX-compatible ASCII inviolation of the terms of the license.andP;  The judge found copyrightinfringement, dismissing defendant's intentions by declaring,andM;The argument essentially is that S andamp; H can misappropriate every internal andexternal feature of a building [and then] cure any impropriety by changingthe tint of the windows and the color of the siding.andM;Can this language be reconciled with that in the NEC-Intel decision?andP;  I leaveit to you.andM;Whatever you think of the positions expressed by these two federal judges,they spotlight a major difficulty of relying on legal principles handed downat the district-court level: as the decisions proliferate, you can eventuallyfind one that will say just about anything you want.andP;  I think the realexplanation for the SASSandamp; H decision is to be found in the fact that the S andamp;H crew acted in a decidedly underhanded fashion, and not so much inspecifically what they did in converting SAS's software into a utilizableform.andP;  But then, hard cases make bad law, as law professors like to say.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law.andP;  He also has served as an administrative lawjudge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
