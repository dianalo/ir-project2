The U.S. Agriculture Department announced yesterdaymorning that it would allow the Soviet Union to useimmediately $315 million in October and February export bonuscredits.</LP><TEXT>   This spawned a strong rally in grain futures trading,which was fueled in part by hot and dry weather throughoutthe Midwest. The corn crop is largely unaffected by weatherat this stage of its development, but protracted heat anddryness could still inflict minor damage on the soybean crop.   After trading ended yesterday, the Agriculture Departmentannounced how the Soviet credit buying would be allocated:$150 million will go to feed grain; $45 million to wheat orflour; and $90 million to soybean meal.   This allocation shows the Soviets will buy more soybeanmeal than expected and less wheat and corn than expected.Analysts expect soybean and soybean meal futures prices tofeel upward pressure in early trading today, while corn andwheat prices are expected to decline.   At the dollar amounts allocated by the AgricultureDepartment, the Soviet Union should be able to buy about 1.3million metric tons of corn; about 500,000 metric tons ofwheat; and about 425,000 metric tons of meal. The unallocatedportion of the $315 million will pay for shipping.   &quot;These allocations show that the Soviets still have abigger desire for feed than food,&quot; said Daniel W. Basse,director of market research for AgResource Co., Chicago.   The $315 million in credit that the Soviets will useaccounts for about 41% of the remaining credit allotted tothem. After this, the Soviet Union will still have about$450.8 million in U.S. export bonus credit available to it.   Also yesterday, grain-growing states releasedcrop-condition reports showing corn and soybean crops largelyunchanged throughout the Midwest and Plains states. Iowa,particularly hard hit by a spell of hot and dry weather inJuly, reported that 41% of the state's corn crop is in faircondition, with 4% in excellent condition, 49% in goodcondition and 6% in poor condition. The Iowa soybean cropfared better; 57% was reported in good condition, with 6%excellent, 34% fair and 3% poor.   Some bullish traders had been expecting crop conditionreports to show more severe deterioration, and theirdisappointment may exert some downward price pressure intrading today.   In trading yesterday, the price of the soybean contractfor November delivery rose 14.75 cents to $5.9450 a bushel;the December corn contract rose four cents to $2.5850 abushel; and the December wheat contract rose seven cents to$3.2075 a bushel.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: After moving as high as $22 a barrel late in theday, crude oil futures prices on the New York MercantileExchange settled at $21.97 a barrel for the October contract,up 16 cents. Trading was light; some market players pointedto a bank holiday in London that closed the InternationalPetroleum Exchange there for the day and the approaching U.S.Labor Day weekend to account for the doldrums. Some others,however, said oil traders and analysts still aren't sure whatweight to assign the events in the Soviet Union, so they areholding tight, waiting for clearer signals. Heating oilfutures prices were higher, as well, but gasoline prices forSeptember and October delivery fell.                                                                                                          COFFEE: After opening lower, future prices turned aroundand resumed their march upward. Coffee for September deliveryended 0.75 cent a pound higher at 83.65 cents. The activelytraded December contract rose one cent to finish at 86.95cents. Coffee prices continue to strengthen on perceptionsthat some of the major producers are forging ahead with plansto retain 10% of their exportable coffee to boost prices,said Judith Ganes, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch. The planwill continue to lend support to prices as long as it's stilla possibility, she added, but that doesn't mean that theretention plan is a viable solution to the problem of lowcoffee prices. If it is implemented, prices could top 90cents again, in large measure because of short-covering, shesaid. Traders cover their short positions, or bets the pricewill fall, by buying offsetting contracts. But when pricesrise to a level that spurs producers to sell the retainedcoffee, prices will come right back down, she predicted. Asimilar program in the cocoa industry failed becausefinancing ran out in 1988, she noted.   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures prices rose in quiettrading. Gold for August delivery rose $1.80 an ounce to$355.20. The actively traded December contract ended $1.70higher at $360.30. The focus of the metals markets for thenext few days will continue to be on the Soviet Union, and inparticular whether the Group of Seven meeting Thursdayproduces any Western aid packages, said William O'Neill,senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch. Additional aidwould ease some of the Soviet Union's need to sell preciousmetals to raise hard currency. Gold prices rallied a bit onword that President Bush had made available export creditguarantees for grain purchases previously allocated for laterin the year, Mr. O'Neill added. Ian MacDonald, vice presidentof precious metals at Credit Suisse, said gold &quot;appearscomfortable&quot; around $350 an ounce for immediate delivery.Buying by the jewelry industry as well as Middle Eastern andAsian investors keeps prices from falling below that level.He doesn't see anything on the horizon that would driveprices higher, adding that gold's eventual recovery will mostlikely come from increasing demand from the jewelry industry.Although it would take a catastrophic event to immediatelyforce gold prices higher, he says, demand could grow over thelong term for gold as a currency in countries where the localpaper money has become worthless, such as in Iraq, andpossibly in the independent republics that might emerge fromthe Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
