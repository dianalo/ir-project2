(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   GTE Corp. said Wednesday that it will cutnearly 7,000 jobs over the next four years as a result of arestructuring of its telephone operations.   An unspecified number of additional jobs will be lost over thenext five years in staff reductions unrelated to the company'srestructuring, said GTE Chairman James ``Rocky'' Johnson in astatement.   The cuts will come mostly from the middle management ranks,although some hourly employees will be let go. GTE employs roughly160,000 people worldwide. Some 85,000 people are employed in thecompany's domestic telephone operations, of which 28,000 are middlemanagers.   The job reductions are expected to generate ``substantial annualcost savings, which will be reflected over time in rate reductionsto GTE customers and in improved earnings for GTE shareholders,''Johnson said.   The company, which will lay off people only as a last resort,said a fair portion of the cuts come from employees opting for earlyretirement.   ``We expect as many as 2,000 people may take advantage of this(early retirement) option,'' said Kent B. Foster, group vicepresident of GTE Telephone Operating Group. GTE already has beguninforming employees about early retirement benefits.   In addition, Foster said the company has had ``a virtual hiringfreeze in place throughout most of this year, so a number ofalready-vacant positions simply will go unfilled.''   He said that some employees will be reassigned to positions inother GTE businesses.   ``Some layoffs are inevitable, however, and will be used only asa last resort,'' Foster said. ``the majority of these will come fromour management ranks and will occur over time.''   The company would not project the number that will be laid off.   GTE announced plans to streamline its telephone operations inMarch to continue improving service quality and to become faster,more flexible and responsive to customer requirements.   Geoff Johnson, telecommunications analyst with Argus Research inNew York, said the job cuts are needed.   ``They definitely have too many people relative to othertelephone companies,'' he said. ``It's also part of a broader trendin the industry ... everyone has been trying to cut costs andreducing through attrition or early retirement.''   Argus's Johnson projected that GTE's plan could save about $93million a year for three years. That does not include severancecosts.   ``This is obviously positive for the bottom line,'' Johnson said.   GTE had combined revenues and sales totaling $15.4 billion in1987. Its three core businesses _ telecommunications, lighting andprecision materials _ employ about 161,000 people in 44 states and38 other countries.</TEXT></DOC>
