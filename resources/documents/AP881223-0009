The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said Thursday thatcontinuing interrogation of Warrant Officer James William Hall III``suggests he might have been selective in the documents he passed.''   ``When all is said and done, it doesn't look too bad,'' said oneofficial.   ``It's not great, but it's not a crisis, either,'' said another.   ``The counter-intelligence people are wringing him out now,''said one source. ``He's still cooperating, singing.''   Hall, 30, of New York City, was arrested Wednesday at his homenear Fort Stewart, Ga., by Army intelligence agents after asuccessful Army-FBI sting operation.   Lt. Col. John Chapla, an Army spokesman, said Hall was movedThursday from Fort Stewart to a prison cell at Fort Meade, Md.,outside Washington, D.C.   According to affidavits filed in federal court in Savannah, Ga.,where Fort Stewart is located, Hall bragged to an unidentified FBIagent ``that he had been passing highly sensitive signalintelligence documents to both the Soviets and the East Germanintelligence services since late 1982.''   ``Hall boasted of the important signal intelligence informationhe had passed, and admitted his motivation to be greed,'' thedocument said. It did not give details on the information.   Hall allegedly passed the information through a Turkish-born,naturalized citizen named Huseyin Yildirim. Yildirim also wasarrested Wednesday at his home in Belleair Beach, Fla., near St.Petersburg.   He had been scheduled to appear at a bond hearing Thursday butthe proceeding was postponed until Tuesday because Yildirim'sattorney had a scheduling conflict.   Chapla said Hall was moved to ``facilitate security,'' noting thebase at Fort Meade has ``secure facilities'' that can be used forcourts-martial that involve the presentation of classified materialas evidence.   Fort Meade also is the site of the National Security Agency, thesupersecret spy agency that conducts electronic surveillance aroundthe world. Hall worked in the field of electronic surveillance forthe Army and, indirectly, the NSA.   The spokesman declined to say whether NSA specialists weresitting in on the interrogation of Hall.   Chapla said Hall not been formally charged with any crimes as ofThursday evening but was being detained under the Uniform Code ofMilitary Justice for suspicion of espionage. He can be held for upto three days on that basis, Chapla said.   According to Army records, Hall held a ``Top Secret'' securityclearance and spent most of his 12 years in the service at posts inWest Germany, where the Army maintains electronic listening postsand intelligence units that would play critical roles in time of war.   During his service career, Hall rose in rank to a point where hecould have provided ``a detailed and damaging look at our techniquesand capabilities when it comes to intercepting radio and voicetraffic and breaking codes,'' explained one official.   ``But we've got to find out how far he went. He could have kepthis handlers happy with less sensitive stuff, too.''   Added an Army source: ``He was a worker bee. He had familiaritywith the techniques and technology of the business of signalsintelligence. It's logical to say he could have really hurt us.''   Chapla said Hall had been flown on an Army airplane from FortStewart to Fort Meade on Thursday afternoon and that in the process,legal jurisdiction over the warrant officer was shifted to thecommander of the Military District of Washington.   That commander is Maj. Gen. Donald C. Hilbert. Shouldinvestigators recommend a grand jury-type proceeding and courtmartial, it will be up to Hilbert to decide how to proceed, Chaplaadded.</TEXT></DOC>
