Oceanography is justthe available medium; the methods and activities the project shares withteachers for studying kelp forests, Bryant pointed out, could easily betransferred to redwood groves.;    John McPherson, a sixth-grade teacher atMorgan Hill's Nordstrom School, said his experience at the institute lastsummer jazzed up his science lessons. Even though his students never went tothe seashore or visited the aquarium, they learned about the marineenvironment from activities in their classrooms. To study viscosity, forinstance, they dropped marbles through different liquids.;    &quot;At the end ofthe year,&quot; the teacher said, &quot;in their evaluations, they said science wastheir favorite subject.&quot;;    Now he plans to take what he's learned in thiscollege course back to his district to help two other teachers design a highschool course in oceanography.;    &quot;This is the way that we all learn thebest,&quot; McPherson said as he sorted through his new collection of seaweed inthe lab, &quot;by getting out there and grabbing the organisms and looking at them.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ALETA WATSON, Mercury News Education Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910710  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  449  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 10, 199100192205,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
