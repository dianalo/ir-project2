Refugees at camps in West Germany meanwhile made a beeline forblue jeans among clothing donated to help start their new lives inthe West.   ``The big thing for these people is blue-jean clothing _blue-jean trousers, blue-jean skirts, and blue-jean jackets,'' saidAmanda Dropalla, who was overseeing distribution of secondhandclothes at Passau.   Other new arrivals were being interviewed for jobs.   At a park near Hamburg, some began setting up temporaryhouseholds in 60 mobile homes.   They are among more than 12,500 refugees who fled as EastEuropean leaders face demands for democratic change. Poland hasinstalled the East bloc's first government led by non-communists,and Hungary's leaders promise free elections. But East Germanyremains among the most rigid communist nations.   New arrivals in West Germany, many young, skilled craftsmen, saythey were dissatisfied with the stagnating economy and politicaloppression in their communist homeland.   Junge Welt, which often reflects official views, said EastGermans no longer can avoid discussing why ``a minority'' fled thecountry of 16.6 million people.   ``How do we make this country indisputably the focal point fordedication and happiness for every individual?'' the newspaper asked.   But the main East German party daily, Neues Deutschland,continued its criticism of West Germany, which it contends has``lured the refugees West.''   It also criticized Hungary for allowing their ``unsanctioneddeparture.''   West Germany's Die Welt newspaper quoted a founding member of areform movement in East Germany as saying demands for change areincreasing dramatically.   ``Things are breaking up, with some wanting to go West and otherslooking for a changed'' East Germany,'' it quoted Hans-JochenTschiche as saying.   He told Die Welt that his Neues Forum, or New Forum, considersitself a platform for smaller reform movements across East Germany.   Tschiche said he sees the possibility of achieving a``reorganization of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany)with reform-minded people'' within the Communist Party, Die Weltreported.   Meanwhile, Western diplomats in East Berlin said East Germanleader Erich Honecker is still recovering slowly from twogall-bladder operations.   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the77-year-old Honecker is so weak he is able to leave his bed for onlya half-hour at a time.   They said his life is not in danger, but he is in no condition toresume his duties.   East German officials concede Honecker's recovery has been slow.</TEXT></DOC>
