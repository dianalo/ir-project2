G.S. Karpechenkov, an employee of the Soviet trade mission inAmsterdam, left the Netherlands on Sunday, Egels said.   He refused to disclose what information Karpechenkov allegedlytried to obtain.   The Soviet was accredited to Sovfrakt, the trade mission'sshipping agency that operates out of the capital, Amsterdam, saidEgels. But he had worked mostly at the Rotterdam offices ofTransworld, a Dutch-Soviet joint venture in shipping, Egels said.   Rotterdam is the world's biggest port and a frequent transitpoint for high technology and computer equipment shipped betweenWestern Europe, Japan and the United States. The North AtlanticTreaty Organization bans the export of several types of suchequipment to Soviet bloc nations.   The port also plays a vital role in bringing U.S. troops and warmaterial to Western Europe in the event of a Warsaw Pact attack.</TEXT></DOC>
