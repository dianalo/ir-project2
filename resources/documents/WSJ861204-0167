LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   British Caledonian Airways, as expected, became the first airline to order McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s new MD-11 aircraft.    British Caledonian, based in Crawley, England, will buy nine of the airliners for nearly $1 billion, the maker of defense, aerospace and computer products said. The orders for the MD-11, which is the successor to the DC-10, are subject to a commitment by McDonnell Douglas to go ahead with the program, the company said.    McDonnell Douglas directors have stipulated that the company must have firm orders for at least 20 planes from two carriers, including one in the U.S., before development of the MD-11 can begin. A company representative has said, however, that &quot;the board can shift the criteria as it sees fit.&quot;    McDonnell Douglas said the order puts it closer to launching the program. The company previously said it expected to get enough orders by year's end to go ahead with the project.    British Caledonian said that under the agreement it is scheduled to receive the first three planes in spring 1990, followed by two each in the spring of 1991, 1992, and 1993. </TEXT></DOC>
