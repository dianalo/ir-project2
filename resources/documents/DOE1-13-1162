<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-13-1162 </DOCNO><TEXT>An approach has been tried for the development of an element techniqueof making low-cost SOG-Si by refining the low-grade silica sand whichcan be abundantly produced domestically, and by reducing high-puritysilica. The approach is divided into two methods: one is to produce high-qualitysilica sand by physical method of floatation, magnetic separation, gravityconcentration, acid treatment, etc., and the other method is to obtainhigh purity silica by chemical method of refining the impurities containedtherein, by mixing with sodium carbonate, waterglass, acid treatment,etc. Then preparatory experiments have been performed for the purposeof producing the silicon (SOG-Si) of solar-battery grade by applyinga high-grade reduction to the obtained high-purity silica: such experimentsas obtaining the conditions for the reduction, construction of reductionfurnace, materials of the furnace and reduction materials, method ofproducing the refining pellet, and so forth.
