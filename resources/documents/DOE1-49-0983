A grid of 63 monitoring wells covering the site were used to samplefor organic species in the groundwater which might enhance the mobilityof radionuclides in the soil/water system. Total organic carbon (TOC)measurements were used as a screening method to select which wells shouldbe used for oxalates, tri-n-butyl phosphate, and EDTA. More thoroughanalyses were performed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometryfor a number of the wells. Using this procedure over 60 compounds wereidentified. Spent solvents, scintillation wastes, and decomposing cellulosicwastes are believed to be the primary sources. None of the compoundswere identified as strong complexing agents which would enhance migration.Preliminary experiments indicated that as much as 40% of the organiccarbon may be humic material. These substances were not further characterized.However, humic materials have been implicated in increasing mobilityof radionuclides in soil/water systems.</TEXT></DOC>
