(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Making Communications EasierandM;With their confusing but exacting protocol settings and myriad functionoptions, communications programs need well-designed interfaces.andP;  The programswe evaluated have different types of both GUIs and text-based interfaces;one, Crosstalk Mk.4, has three interfaces from which to choose; and severalprograms include interface programming features in their script languages forthose who want to create custom interfaces.andM;Interface preferences are somewhat subjective; some people prefer graphicselements, while others favor a stark command line.andP;  The major issues are textversus graphics interfaces, menu styles, on-line help, and, as a closesupplement to the on-screen interface, printed documentation.andM;The contest between graphics- and text-mode interfaces doesn't have a clearwinner.andP;  While many people prefer the look of GUIs, that appeal is notuniversal.andP;  Of the 12 programs evaluated in this Software Buyer's Guide, onlyfour run in graphics mode, and all of them (Crosstalk for Windows, DynaCommAsynchronous for Windows, MicroPhone II for Windows, and Win-Comm) areWindows 3.0 programs.andP;  The remaining packages are text-based, though theymake varying use of color, movement, and the IBM text-mode graphics characterset to spruce up their screens.andP;  Hyper ACCESS/5, with its multiple screensthat slide in and out accompanied by various sound cues, makes the most of anall-text interface.andM;The four Windows 3.0 programs use the standard complement of horizontal andpull-down menus, pop-up option and dialog boxes, and icons.andP;  DynaComm makesthe greatest use of icons within the program itself, particularly in itsimpressive Director script, which is an internal interface for creating andediting scripts and logging on to host systems.andP;  All four programs can set uptheir own Windows program groups, complete with special icons for startingthe programs, loaded with specific functions or scripts.andP;  Examples includestarting a program and logging on to MCI Mail, CompuServe, or Dow Jones,setting the program in answer or host mode, and turning on the program'skeystroke recorder.andM;Running graphics-based programs requires more memory, drive storage, and CPUcycles, as well as higher resolution and faster video.andP;  If you already have ahigh-powered PC with plenty of memory (4MB and above) and at least VGA video,you'll do fine with a graphics-based system; though program menu and screenchanges will likely take longer than with text-based systems.andM;Of the text-based systems, Relay Gold has the simplest or most primitive(depending on your preference) menu system, with vertical centered menuselections chosen by keyboard function keys.andP;  You can select a command-lineinterface in ProComm Plus, Mirror III, and Crosstalk Mk.4--great for purists.andO;Most of the remaining programs work from combinations of on-line and off-linemenus, often with dialing directories and function-key assignments displayedon the bottom of the screen.andM;All the programs have context-sensitive on-line help, often combined withindexed help referencing.andP;  With their indexed help systems combined withcontext-sensitive graphics help, the Windows programs win out in the helpcategory, but ProComm Plus's single-screen command reference is impressivelycomprehensive and also easy to use.andM;In general, the programs' documentation reflects the progress softwaremanuals have made in the last few years.andP;  Each manual has an index, and thereare separate sections or even separate manuals to cover the scriptprogramming language.andM;You'll want to look for easy-to-learn interfaces with on-line help andmanuals designed for easy reference.andP;  These features don't make programs runfaster or perform more functions, but they can certainly make them easier touse and more convenient.andM;BUYING TIPSandM;* Graphics- vs.andP;  Text-based ProgramsandM;Text-based programs often run faster (in changing screens, not transmittingdata) than GUI programs, but in general aren't as easy to use.andP;  If you wan toprogram that's manageable for new users, narrow your focus to CUIprograms--as long as you have the hardware to run them.andM;* Menu StylesandM;Menu-style preferences are subjective.andP;  Some packages offer a variety ofinterfaces or let you customize your own.andP;  Find out if you can set up yourown menus and what that process entails.andM;* On-Line HelpandM;All the programs evaluated offer on-line help, which can help you save onconnect charges because it minimizes time searching for the help you need.andO;Inquire about the extent of the on-line help and how easy it is to use.andM;* DocumentationandM;Good manuals and user's guides help new users learn programs, programmerswork with script languages, and everyone install software.andP;  Find out what'sincluded, how it's organized, whether it includes illustrations of screens,and how many pages it has.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
