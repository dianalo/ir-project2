The still developing implanter technologyoffers a variety of systems suited to different purposes. The types ofion source are described in terms of attributes which influence the choiceof a source for a particular application. Extractors are discussed toa lesser extent, and other system parts are mentioned briefly. Althoughpresent semiconductor ion implanters deliver 10-20 mA, the technologycan be extended easily to over 100 mA, especially when mass analysisis not required. For large-area applications, the ion source can be oneof several designs based on magnetic cusp confinement of a plasma containingthe ion of interest.</TEXT></DOC>
