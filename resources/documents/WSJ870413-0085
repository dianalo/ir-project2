Leon B. Kellner, U.S. attorney for the southern district of Florida, said an 18-count indictment was returned against Arthur E. Kapel and against his son, Clifford J. Kapel, both of Miami.    Also charged was Miami-based Technical Service International Inc. Arthur Kapel is president of the company, and his son is a manager. Technical Service sells and exports aircraft spare parts, Mr. Kellner said.    According to the indictment, the defendants began conspiring to export F-5 fighter parts to Chile in 1984, through contacts with Chilean air force officials in Washington. The indictment says the defendants took orders valued at more than $250,000 through July 2, 1986, when company offices were raided by the U.S. Customs Service.    A spokesman for the Chilean Embassy said he didn't have enough information to comment on the charge. The spokesman confirmed that Chile has air force, army and naval attaches with diplomatic credentials in Washington.    Benedict Kuehne, an attorney for the Kapels, said, &quot;They have done nothing wrong.&quot; He said Technical Service shipped &quot;traditional aircraft parts&quot; to Chile rather than strictly military parts. In addition, he said, the Kapels didn't know &quot;that they were dealing with a proscribed country.&quot;    Since 1976, there has been a congressionally imposed ban on shipping articles designed for military use to Chile. According to the statute, the ban is to remain in effect until the secretary of state certifies that Chile has made significant progress in complying with internationally recognized principles of human rights.    &quot;No such certification has been made, and the embargo remains in effect,&quot; Mr. Kellner said.    The defendants, if convicted on all counts, could face as much as 185 years in prison and fines of $17 million each. </TEXT></DOC>
