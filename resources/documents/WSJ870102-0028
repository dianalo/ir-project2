For 1987, analysts say, lower inflation, lower oil prices and generally restrained government policies add up to a favorable outlook for most of Europe.    The London, Oslo and Amsterdam exchanges all suffered last year from the fall in oil and gas prices because of the British, Norwegian and Dutch economies' ties to the North Sea oil industry.    In London, Frankfurt and Zurich, markets also had to absorb a batch of huge share flotations. But smaller markets such as Madrid and to a lesser extent Paris and Brussels turned in star performances.    In London, where prices peaked in the spring, 1986 was the year of the &quot;Big Bang,&quot; the market restructuring whose echoes were heard across the world. But 1986 also saw the entry of Spain and Portugal into the Common Market and the start of &quot;privatization,&quot; or sale to individual investors, of large state-owned concerns in France.    Here is a summary of the past year and the outlook for this year on major European markets:    LONDON: Dramatic structural changes last year caused turnover to rise sharply, deepened the market and reinforced its role as an international equity trading center. But prices wavered after peaking in the spring, and the outlook for 1987 is uncertain.    In March, the exchange opened its membership to foreign concerns, admitting such international securities giants as Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Nomura Securities Co. Then in October, the so-called Big Bang deregulated commissions on stock trades and ended the division between stockbroking and market-making concerns. In November, the exchange merged with an association formed by the world's largest securities houses and renamed itself the International Stock Exchange, becoming the first exchange to be dominated by foreign concerns.    A number of big rights issues and new share issues soaked up liquidity, including Britain's largest new equity issue ever, the British Gas PLC offering valued at more than $8 billion. London also started to draw a significant amount of continental European equity business during 1986. David Freud of Warburg Securities Ltd., a unit of Mercury International Group PLC, estimates that London firms, including Warburg, now do about 20% of all the business in French equities, compared with around 5% a few years ago.    FRANKFURT: The market was close to flat in 1986 after making strong gains the previous year. But analysts say an upturn is likely in 1987.    &quot;There is still a lot of international liquidity available for equity investments,&quot; says Wolfgang Roeller, chairman of Dresdner Bank AG. &quot;The average price/earnings ratio of standard German shares, at about 11, is relatively low in historical and international terms.&quot;    PARIS: The stock market hit record highs in 1986 for the third consecutive year and is expected to continue to rise in 1987, although at a more moderate pace.    Analysts cited the March election victory by conservatives, the new government's privatization campaign, takeover battles, improved corporate profits and a &quot;positive economic environment.&quot;    ZURICH: Stock price increases lagged behind expectations in 1986. But analysts are forecasting a better 1987.    &quot;We're operating from the standpoint that 1987 is going to be a good year,&quot; Swiss Bank Corp.'s senior vice president, Christoph F. Puhr, says. Swiss companies are expected to report improved profits for 1986. The opening to foreigners of the market for registered shares, through the legal loophole of so-called covered warrants, is expected to boost this type of security. High liquidity among institutional investors also is expected to channel money into the stock market.    AMSTERDAM: Price growth in 1986 was sluggish compared with the average 33% rises of the previous four years. The recent stabilization of the dollar and an improvement in Dutch company profits could help prices to firm in 1987. On the down side, however, strains between the two parties in the Netherlands' center-right coalition government could develop into a crisis.    MADRID: International investor interest is expected to keep growing this year, even after prices doubled in 1986, and trading volume tripled.    Though Madrid's performance was atypical and reflected the market's narrow scope, it also was a sign of increased confidence in Spain after its entry into the Common Market last year. Analysts expect a further strong increase in 1987.    BRUSSELS: Despite repeated government crises in Belgium, 1986 was an ebullient year, and most analysts say they expect growth to continue in 1987.    Lower oil prices, lower interest rates, higher company profits and government measures to support the market all boosted shares. Volume set a record, rising 20% from 1985 and more than doubling 1984 levels.    OSLO: The market was hammered throughout 1986 by political turmoil and falling oil prices. The weakness of the Norwegian currency, the krone, led the central bank to raise interest rates, which depressed prices further.    But the relatively low P/E ratios of many Norwegian companies helped to maintain foreign investor interest, especially in shares of Norway's three biggest banks, all of which rose to record levels in December.    MILAN: Sharp gains in the first five months gave way to slackening share prices in a more selective market. The sharp downturn in December could lead to a weak market in the first few months of this year, analysts say. Although market leaders such as Fiat and Montedison recovered late in 1986, &quot;Most shares are way below May levels,&quot; one Milan broker said.    STOCKHOLM: After rising for most of 1986, share prices fell in November and December, and many analysts fear the slide could continue in 1987. If the Swedish government moves to curb consumption this year, stock prices could resume their climb, analysts say. Without such action, interest rates could rise further, depressing shares.    VIENNA: The market failed to live up to the promise of its 1985 surge. Capital increases and new share flotations absorbed a large share of new money, and foreign analysts continue to complain that the availability of financial information isn't up to general international standards. &quot;There aren't many companies to choose from, and most are not marketable,&quot; says Hugh Priestley, a director of Henderson Administration PLC, London.    ---                    Stock Market Performances                  Jan. 1 through Dec. 29, 1986                                               Change in                                Change in      Exchange                                Market         Rate vs.                                Index*         U.S. Dollar    Mexico                      275.54%        82.80%    Spain                        81.58        -14.08    Italy                        64.11        -19.40    Japan                        57.73        -20.82    France                       52.87        -14.67    Hong Kong                    49.45         -0.16    Singapore/MA                 46.88          3.56    Sweden                       44.75        -10.26    Australia                    41.63          2.94    The World Index              39.80          0.0    Belgium                      39.39        -18.74    United Kingdom               19.13        142.84    U.S.A.                       14.65          0.0    Netherlands                   7.79        -20.55    Canada                        5.70         -1.29    Germany                       5.65        -20.91    Austria                       4.57        -20.83    Switzerland                   3.21        -21.45    Denmark                     -19.08        -17.78    Norway                       -8.23         -2.34   *In local currencies based on the Capital InternationalStock Market Indices (1970=100)   Source: Morgan Stanley Capital I nternational Perspective,Geneva Switzerland</TEXT></DOC>
