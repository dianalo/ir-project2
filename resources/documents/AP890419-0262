(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Dynamics Corp. said Wednesday thatit had a 12 percent decrease in first-quarter net earnings, due inpart to declining earnings in its military aircraft operation.   Net earnings for the first quarter of 1989 were $75.4 million,or $1.81 a share, on revenue of $2.36 billion, compared with netearnings of $85.7 million, or $2.04 a share, on revenue of $2.42billion during the same period last year.   The decline in operating earnings in the military aircraftsegment resulted from lower volume and a reduction of the earningsrate in the F-16 program, said Stanley C. Pace, chairman and chiefexecutive. Those trends reflected lower margins on recent contractawards as well as cost increases resulting from simultaneousproduction of more than 20 versions of the aircraft, he said.   Pace said that improved manufacturing techniques and costcontainments continued to raise the peformance level of thecompany's land systems business. He also cited increasing demandfor business jets as contributing to a favorable performance in thegeneral aviation business.   Among the contracts the St. Louis-based company won during thefirst quarter was for the lead ship construction for the Seawolfclass of attack submarines and for the upgrading of the M1A1 Abramstank.   The company also signed an agreement with St. Louis-basedMcDonnell Douglas, valued at about $2 billion over the next sixyears, for production of fuselages for the MD-11 aircraft.</TEXT></DOC>
