The test programperformed covers a temperature range from 900 to 1750degC. The main itemwas the investigation of the release under oxidizing conditions and atpresence of Zircaloy. The reactions occurring thereby cause a strongincrease of iodine and cesium release. The influence of the temperatureon the release is characterized by a change of the activation energywithin the temperature regime of the experimental program.
