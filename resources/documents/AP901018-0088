(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Authorities struck a blow to Hells Angelsmotorcycle clubs that traffic in methamphetamines when theyarrested 15 people in the Omaha area and one in California, an FBIagent said.   ``We're going to knock the socks off the Hells Angels here,''said Dennis Aiken, assistant special agent for the FBI in Omaha.   Surrounded by confiscated rifles, a .22-caliber automaticpistol, $800,000 worth of drugs, $200,000 in cash as well as HellsAngels jackets and posters, Aiken said a two-year investigationculminated in simultaneous raids Wednesday on 14 locations,including the motorcycle club's headquarters in Omaha.   A Rottweiler guard dog was killed after it attacked an officerat the clubhouse and one man at the clubhouse resisted arrest, butthe other searches and arrests were conducted without incident,Aiken said.   ``We consider this group to be a major center in the traffickingof methamphetamines,'' Aiken said at a news conference. HellsAngels clubs have played a major role in methamphetamine traffic inthe country, he said.   Many of the fewer than 50 club members in the Omaha area are nowin jail, Aiken said. Everyone arrested in the Omaha area Wednesdaywas a Hells Angel club member or an associate of the club, Aikensaid.   The investigation continued and it wasn't known how muchcontraband and money would eventually be confiscated, Aiken said.   Charges included interstate and foreign travel in support ofracketeering enterprises, money laundering, manufacturing anddistribution of a controlled substance and felony possession of afirearm, an FBI news release said.   Eleven of the 16 people arrested Wednesday in or near Omaha andin Long Beach, Calif., had been named in a federal grand juryindictment handed up Monday, Aiken said. The five others werearrested on charges of drug possession based on evidence obtainedduring the raids, he said.   Larry Holmquist, an FBI spokesman, would not comment on theconnection between the arrest in California and the others here.   Douglas County Sheriff Dick Roth said the suspects had beeninvestigated as far back as 1978.   ``We have had tons of intelligence on these people's actionsover the years,'' Roth said.   A cooperative effort that included the FBI, Nebraska StatePatrol and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration usedelectronic surveillance such as wire intercepts, Aiken said. Herefused to say whether undercover agents played a role.   Homes and businesses were searched in Omaha; in Valley, a townwest of here; and in Council Bluffs, across the Missouri River inIowa, the FBI said.</TEXT></DOC>
