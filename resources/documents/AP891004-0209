Manuel AntonioNoriega on a small group of disgruntled soldiers backed by theUnited States.   In remarks to reporters, Provisional President FranciscoRodriguez asserted Tuesday's attempted coup ``was fostered andsupported by the government of the United States'' but that it``found no resonance of any kind within the ranks of the defenseforces or citizens.''   He asserted there was no widespread dissatisfaction in thePanamanian military. Noriega, the Defense Forces chief, uses hisofficial position to maintain de facto control of the government.   In Tuesday's coup attempt, rebel forces attacked and seized theDefense Forces headquarters in Panama City and claimed to haveousted Noriega. But forces loyal to Noriega counterattacked andtook back the compound several hours later.   The Panamanian military said about 65 rebel soldiers weredetained.   In his comments, Rodriguez claimed videotapes show U.S. tanksand ``U.S. contingents in combat readiness blocking roads in ourcountry in order to prevent contingents of the Defense Forces fromhaving access to the headquarters.'' He said film and photographswould also be release as proof.   President Bush has denied the United States engineered theattempt to overthrow Noriega, but White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater said U.S. officials had advance knowledge of it.   U.S. officials said American forces moved into positions nearthe fighting for security reasons.   Rodriguez was asked why a superpower like the United Stateswould not be able to topple Noriega if it really wanted to supporta coup.   ``It is clear that overt aggression backed by actual troops ofthe U.S. Army would make everything too clear, and they reallywanted to cover up their ambitions in this area. But there is clearevidence, photographs and so on, that there was support from theU.S. Army stationed in our country,'' said Rodriguez.   He said his provisional government will ``evaluate'' whether tohold national elections some time after March but that Panamacannot hold free and fair elections until the United States endsits ``military and economic aggression.''   The U.S. government has been trying to force out Noriega sincetwo federal grand juries in Florida indicted him ondrug-trafficking and money-laundering charges last year.   U.S. efforts have included diplomatic pressure and trade andeconomic sanctions against Panama.   But the steps have not budged Noriega, whose government annulledMay 7 presidential elections. International observers saidopposition candidate Guillermo Endara won the presidency by alandslide.   Rodriguez, a longstanding associate of Noriega, was installed asa provisional president after the election was nullified.</TEXT></DOC>
