 The anadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) hasmirrored the international trend towards liberalization oftelecommunications.andM;The imminent expansion of the jurisdiction of the CRTC to include all ofCanada will provide for a uniform operating environment across the country.andO;The CRTC has encouraged competition and deregulation on issues such asinterconnect and resale/sharing of services.andM;The trend towards increased competition continued recently with the approvalto decrease the price of inter-exchange bandwidth under the CompetitiveBusiness Networks-2 (CBN-2) filing.andP;  The current debate on Message Toll (longdistance) competition prompted by Unitel will occupy the regulatory agendafor the near term and should set the regulatory tone for the 1990s.andM;The impact of digital technology on telecommunications is all-pervasive.andO;With the arrival of end-to-end digital networking, the carriers' networks arepoised to become Canada's largest distributed data processing system.andP;  Themarriage of computers, switching, fibre-optic transmission and new signallingprotocols heralds the advent of the intelligent network.andM;To counteract the erosion of traffic from the Public Switched TelephoneNetwork (PSTN) to private backbone networks, the carriers are changing theinfrastructure of the public network itself.andM;By deploying a switching protocol called Common Channel Signalling systemnumber 7 (CCS #7) and signalling transfer computers, the carrier can nowseparate call control (establishment, completion billing) from the actualswitching function.andM;This intelligent network allows a central database to make the optimal choiceof services and routes, and allows for the timely introduction of newvalue-added services via software revision.andM;Two new services vitally dependent on the power of the intelligent networkare the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Virtual PrivateNetworking (VPN).andP;  ISDN has long promised to be the panacea to manynetworking issues.andM;By providing high-speed, digital, integrated access to the carrier'sintelligent network from the customer premises, ISDN was to be the foundationfor serving all subscribers' networking needs from the monopoly publicnetwork.andM;The limiting factor on public networks had always been the available accesstransmission speed.andP;  ISDN allows the end-user flexible access to 64 Kbps ofbandwidth for any application desired.andM;The Virtual Private Network was conceived to provide the benefits of aprivate network with customized features and billing on the public network.andO;Virtual networking combines the reach and economies of scale that the PSTNprovides with the traffic management and call accounting features previouslyobtained only on private networks.andM;VPN can extend the availability of PBX-line (Private Branch eXchange)features to each geographic location a company conducts business in,regardless of size or traffic volume.andM;Unfortunately, these services are far from being universally available inCanada.andM;The deployment of CCS #7 into the Class 5 switches in the four largest urbanareas of Ontario and Quebec was just completed late in 1990.andM;Interconnection of these islands of connectivity via the inter-city tollnetwork will not be possible until 1992.andM;The capital investment required to bring other geographic locations withinthe reach of the intelligent network will probably delay universal accessuntil well into the nineties.andM;In the interim, organizations could obtain some of the benefits of theintelligent network concept by deploying a private ISDN voice network andutilizing a private multiplexer backbone to inexpensively transport thetraffic.andM;As ISDN Primary Rate Access (PRA) becomes available in major urban centresacross Canada, it can be integrated into the backbone to provide access tobandwidth-on-demand from the public network for alternate routing, disasterrecovery, peak load demands or public networking connectivity.andM;By recognizing this important networking component, ISDN PRA access an beengineered as an integral part of a WAN solution and provide a flexiblemigration path for future needs.andM;The carrier's focus on the intelligent network and ISDN may be eclipsed bythe emergence of new wideband techniques such as Frame Relay for transmittingand switching data.andM;The growth rate of data traffic on the network infrastructure now far exceedsthat of voice.andM;Certainly, trasmission at the ISDN bearer channel rate of 64 Kpps will not befast enough to efficiently switch and transport accelerating volumes of datafrom applications such as LAN-to-LAN internetworking, graphics, imagetransfer and others.andM;The author is vice-president and general manager of Willowdale, Ont.-basedGeneral Data Comm Ltd.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
