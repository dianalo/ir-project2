Collier, program manager for office automation, said thecommand chose the Ethernet LANs from 10Net Communications of Dayton, Ohio, sousers could share printers and other devices securely.andM;The networks connect 2,000 Zenith Data Systems Corp. 150, 200, 248 and 386microcomputers.andP;  The largest site has 90 micros.andM;Application software includes OfficeWriter 6.1 from office Solutions Inc. inMadison, Wis.; dBASE III Plus from Ashton-Tate Corp. in Torrance, Calif.;andO;Timeline from Breakthrough Software in Novato, Calif.; Enable from EnableSoftware Inc. in Ballston Lake, N.Y.; and Harvard Graphics from SoftwarePublishing Corp. in Mountain View, Calif.andM;&quot;To save money, the Air Force installed the LANs,&quot; Collier said.andP;  &quot;We wantedsomething easy to install.andP;  We put ends on the connectors, put cards in themachines and put the software up.andP;  We didn't need contractors.&quot;andM;Collier estimated that decision saved the government $2.5 million.andP;  Thehardware cost was more than $5 million.andM;Because much of ESC's information is classified, the 10Net security packageis supplemented by Protec from Sophco Inc. in Boulder, Colo.andM;&quot;10Net keeps two people's messages from going to the same place at the sametime,&quot; Collier said.andP;  &quot;We incorporated Protec to prevent unauthorized use ofapplications.&quot;andM;The security software also can encrypt data if necessary.andM;&quot;We're looking at hardware encryption devices.andP;  We still have our eyes open,&quot;Collier said.andM;He praised fiber, calling it &quot;so inexpensive compared with twisted pair thatif you have a had run, sometimes it's just as cheap to rip the fiber out andput in a new line.andM;&quot;It's very durable,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;People have stepped on it, rolled chairs overit.andP;  There's a lot of pulling and tugging and going around corners andthrough pipes.andP;  We have rerun only one cable out of 20 or 30 miles of cable.&quot;andM;ESC eventually will replace the older micros on the network with 80386 microsto gain more memory.andM;&quot;A lot of people are doing briefings,&quot; Collier said.andP;  &quot;Harvard Graphics needsa pretty good-size memory.andM;&quot;We're also looking at connecting the OA LANs to other LANs.andP;  One of ouradvances will be a 386 file server at each site,&quot; Collier said.andM;&quot;We won't have spend a lot of money to upgrade to 386s.&quot;andM;The first two sites received file servers in February.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
