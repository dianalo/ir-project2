Sheldon, Neil; Wood, Peter; Coutts-Smith, Paul.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>PC ClinicandM;Q I produce files uwing Ventura 2 (Professional) in IBM PC format which arethen output by a local printers on their Linotronic 200.andP;  These are C00files.andM;The printers use a Macintosh system but are able to translate the PC filesexcept that they cannot rotate the pages (as they can with MAC files) to givemore economical use of the 12-inch wide bromide paper.andP;  So, each A4 page haslots of wasted space on either side of it.andM;I believe there may be some kind of software solution available for this.andO;Can you tell me if this is so and how to obtain it?andP;  Being PostScript isseems likely that there is some relatively easy solution.andM;Hope this can be dealt with on an out-patient basis rather than by drasticsurgery.andP;  Elliot R Robertson, Westec, Oban, Argyll.andM;A the houseman made a breline for Xerox to see if it could provide us with apainless solution.andP;  According to David Stevenson of Ventura TechnicalSupport, the following technique can be tried.andP;  (However, he does warn thatsome users have had more success than others, as in some cases the RIP(raster image processing) dipped the page image to the width of an A4 pagebut with the top or bottom third missing).andM;Providing that the RIP is PostScript based, a simple PostScript command canbe used to rotate the entire page through 90 degrees.andP;  This involves changingthe PS2.andP;  PRE file (found in the Ventura sub-directory) which is sent to thePostScript printer at the start of every job.andM;To change the file, use a text editor or the ASCII function of your wordprocessor.andP;  Locate the/GEMMATION, which looks like this:andM;/GEMMATIN {/landscape ed/p3 ed/p2 ed/pl ed gr 72 300 div exch div dup scaleclippath pathbbox exch/prx ed exch dup/ply ed sub 1 add p3 sub 2 div plyadd/ty ed dup prx exch sub 1 add p2 sub 2 div add landscape{pl add} if tytranslate landscape {90 rotate} if gs} bdandM;To rotate an A4 portrait page through 90 degrees, add the following commandsbefore the final gs{ bd: 3507 0 translate 90 rotateandM;These commands move the page origin by the length of an A4 page (3507 = 297mmconverted to 300ths of an inch) and then rotate it.andP;  You may find thatdoesn't position the page correctly -- an alternative measure to 3507 is 2480(2480 =210mm converted to 300ths of an inch).andM;Thus the final section of the amended command should look like this (theposition of the line breaks is irrelevant):andM;landscape {pl add} if ty translate landscape {90 rotate} if 3507 0 translate90 rotate gs} bdandM;These commands can be added to a copy of the PS2.PRE and a simple DOS batchfile can be used to swap the non-standard file with a standard one whentypesetter jobs requiring rotation are to be run.andM;Not as painful as you thought, was it?andM;Q Recently, I ordered a copy of Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 and asked for SQZ Plusas well.andM;When I got them back, however, I found they didn't work together so I rang4-5-6 World (the supplier).andP;  It told me these two products are incompatibleand when it advertises version 2.0 or greater it means version 2.0 up toversion 2.9999.andM;Is an upgrade of SQZ Plus due for release in the near future?andP;  Nick Phythian,Ryedale District Council.andM;A The reason Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 isn't compatible with SQZ Plus is becauseSQZ Plus reads file formats up to WK2 whereas 1-2-3 Release 3 reads WK3format files.andM;Also, the Release 3 version of 1-2-3 compresses files by three quarters.andP;  Asthis is the original function of SQZ Plus anyway, it means that the new Lotus1-2-3 negates the use of any add-on.andM;Symantec (the manufacturer), however, has promised us that a new SQZ Plusproducts is in the pipeline and will be released in the second quarter of1991.andM;The new product will be able to read WK3 files and the chances are thatthere'll be some other hidden extras too.andM;Q I'm using the Windows 3.0 Software Development Kit on a Compaq 386/33.andP;  I'dlike to be able to run the Codeview dehugger, but it needs a secondarymonitor.andM;The manual describes it as a monochrome adaptor card.andP;  I've talked toMicrosoft and they tell me it must be an MDA -- any graphics capability wouldinterfere with the onboard VGA of the Compaq.andM;Does anyone know of a supplier of MDAs?andP;  I can't find any.andP;  Andrew Shand, AEAEnvironment, Harwell.andM;A Two of the surgeons clashed over this one, each stubbornly convinced hisown method was right.andP;  In the end, the chief surgeon stepped in weilding ascalpel and demanding kiss-and-make-up.andP;  A combination of all possiblediagnoses came up with the following:andM;Basically, there are several ways you can run a debugger on Windowsapplications.andP;  First is using an AT-compatible machine and Codeview, in whichcase y ou have to use an MDA card as you so rightly said.andM;If your machine is a PS/2 you can use an IBM 8514 adaptor card.andP;  In this caseyou should use the mono monitor for the Windows application and your VGAmonitor for Codeview.andM;With the Software Development Kit comes another debugger called Symdeb(Symbolic Debug Utility), which isn't quite as effective as Codeview, butit'll work from a dumb terminal plugged into the serial port of your machine.andO;All instructions relevant to running either debugger can be found in Chapter7 of the SDK tools manual.andM;But back to the original question.andP;  After many phone calls (including one toCompaq) the surgeons tracked down a supplier of Hercules MDA cards.andP;  Checkout the Hercules Text Card, available from Barco Cameron on (0734) 664611,price 59 pounds.andP;  (Phew.)andM;Q I've been trying to get Windows 3.0 working with our Token Ring network(running Novell Netware 386) since early June.andP;  My crime is that I'm tryingto use non-Windows applications.andM;The trouble only arises in 386 mode and when the network is connected with anon-Windows application that uses expanded memory.andP;  Using Paradox orSymphony, for example, when I attempt to retrieve a file from the network theapplication halts and the network disconnects.andM;I have to use the EMMExclude statement in the SYSTEM.INI file to eliminatethe risk of Windows using the memory that the Token Ring adaptor -- that muchI accept.andP;  But no permutation of EMMInclude or EMMExclude statements willcure the problem.andP;  If I use NoEMMDriver=true then non-Windoes applicationscan work in a virtual machine without a problem -- except that I lose all theexpanded memory.andP;  I had a similar problem with Windows 386 and this waseventually solved, but that solution doesn't work here.andP;  Microsoft sees noreason why it shouldn't work, as I've a continuous block of 64Kb (which isnecessary to implement expanded memory) and as mentioned above there's nomemory conflict with the Token Ring adaptor.andM;Bt the way, Novell claims that there's nothing wrong with its network shells,depite the fact that Andrew King (Windows product manager) told me that Ineed version 3.06 of IPX and NET3.andP;  Version 3.06 doesn't actually exist --the highest version of both these files is 3.01, which I have.andP;  Darren Adams,analyst programmer.andM;A Darren Adams actually answered this one himself: The solution to theproblem is as follows.andP;  We know that we have to have a clear 64Kb page framesomewhere between A000 and FFFF to allow expanded memory to work.andP;  When usinga Token Ring adaptor, you also have to be sure that Windows doesn't try touse the memory address that the card uses -- typically CC00 or DC00.andM;Earlier in the year, I established that you have to use the DXMAOMOD.SYS andDXMCOMOD.SYS drivers rather than TOKREUI to run Windows 386.andP;  The sameapplies to Windows 3.0.andP;  Then you have to tear open your system unit andchange the dip switches on the Token Ring adaptor so that its memory addressis DC00.andM;The memory usage chart in the back of the 'Token Ring Adaptor Guide toOperations' says that C800 is used for the hard disk controller.andP;  I have iton good authority, however, that this applies to ATs and 286 machines only.andO;Well, you can't use Windows' 386 mode on those machines.andP;  But on my 386 (aCompaq DeskPro 386/25)c C800 is clear, so you can use the area between C400and D600 for the page frame.andM;Now you have to edit the [386Enh] section in the SYSTEM.INI file.andP;  Firstdisable all memory between A000 and FFFF using:andM;EMExclude&quot;A000-FFFFandM;This takes care of anything that may conflict with Windows memory, includingthe Token Ring adaptor memory.andP;  To reinstate memory for the page frame use:andM;EMMIclude=C400-D400andM;Note that EMMInclude takes precedence over EMMExclude.andP;  You can also insertthe following two lines:andM;ReservePageFrame=true TokenRingSearch=trueandM;Obviously, you have to have HIMEM.SYS loaded, and disable any expanded memorymanagers.andP;  It's best to clear out any device drivers first and thenexperiment with how many you can put back in.andM;One other tip: if you create a PIF file for a network batch file tahtcontainsandM;map commands, don't get smart by thinking you can minimize while it loads up-- it can halt your system.andP;  You can run the map commands in a window, butkeep it in the foreground.andM;I hope that this solution will work for all ISA 386 machines.andP;  I'm not surewhat'll happen with MCA machines such as the PS/2, although a colleagueassures me that it's easy because you can move all the memory addressesaround.andM;Thanks for responding to my query -- sorry I beat you to the solution.andM;Q Please help!andP;  For many years I had an 88XT PC which I used with aMiniScribe 20Mb hard card.andP;  Recently, however, I bought a Bull 286 APM 45 PCand decided to use my MiniScribe here too.andP;  The only problem here is a verylong pause -- about 30 seconds -- when I boot up.andP;  Although I've checked allinstructions a million times I can't seem to change this.andP;  Do you think thismight have something to do with the fact that the card is XT/AT.andM;Could you explain what makes a card XT/AT-compatible?andP;  Mr Phillips, Bath,Avon.andM;A Your problems with MiniScribe may not be solved as easily as you think, asthe company no longer exists.andP;  Back in April it was bouth out by Maxtor, andmost of the product line was discontinued.andP;  Consequently, you'll find nodirect replacement, although you can try a new hardcard from anothermanufacturer.andM;What determines whether a card is XT or AT is the width of the bus.andP;  The oldXT has 8 bits whereas the AT has 16 bits.andP;  The greater the number of bits,the greater the amount of data that can be transferred at once.andM;Q I've two PCs with rather different specifications but both exhibiting thesame fault.andP;  The machines are a 386SX with 3Mb memory running under DOS 3.3and a 286XT with 1Mb (384Kb for a print spooler and a RAM disk) running underDIS 3.2 The fault is that both machines report 638Kb based memory rather than640Kb.andM;I've tried various memory reporting programs including the one in PC Toolsand the one in DESQview, but I can't discover where the missing 2Kb has gone.andO;Quarterdeck's Manifest describes it as unused.andP;  To make the probelem worse,the missing memory is variable: sometimes I get 637Kb, once I got 636Kb, andIf I boot from a floppy disk with no CONFIG.SYS and no AUTOEXEC.BAT I can(sometimes!) get 640Kb.andP;  On both machines the memory checks out OK at startup.andM;Looking for a common link, all I can come up with is that they both supportshadow RAM (although the fault persists when this is disabled), and they bothhave Hercules cards.andP;  Neil Sheldon, Manchester Grammar School.andM;A Unifortunately Microsoft couldn't find a way to help you on this one.andP;  Thereason is that all versions of DOS are adapted to some extent by themanufacturers who supply them to you.andP;  DOS technical support only operates indirect contact with hardware manufacturers, and so you must contact yoursupplier first.andM;The manufacturers of your 386SX machine, IQUE, have a manufacturing anddistribution arm in the UK called Supply Technology.andP;  It gave this advice:andM;The answer to this apparent problem is quite simple.andP;  But first, to avoidconfusion, the shadow RAM has nothing to do with this problem.andM;Many users who have an application or utilities package such as PC-Tools arelikely to load small programs such as expanded memory managers and cachesystems.andM;The memory used by these programs and programs such as Disk Manager byOntrack must be taken from the base memory of the computer.andP;  Thus, without athorough understanding of how the base memory/extended/expanded memorystructure works, operation of a diagnostic program is liable to cause panic.andM;A good program for checking memory is QAPlus diagnostics, which shows theamount of base memory installed and the amount usable.andP;  For instance, in themachine I'm using now, our new IQUE 386SX/20MHz, I've 640Kb base memoryinstalled.andP;  I have, however, only 296Kb available because I've loaded DiskManager software and various RAM-resident utilities.andM;Anyone with this particular problem should rename their AUTOEXEC.BAT andCONFIG.SYS files, making sure there are no special drivers such as DMDRVR.BINbefore doing this and then run a diagnostics program which shows both theavailable and the installed memory.andM;Q  I have a Tandon Board (PCBA 1888 40 002E) which needs repairing becausethe floppy disk controller chip (OM2 made by LPR) is broken.andP;  But when Icalled Tandon it just told me that it didn't carry spares for the boards.andM;Is this just because the chip is integrated with the board?andM;Can I use a separate floppy disk controller?andM;Is my only option to buy a completely new board?andP;  Peter Wood, Chesterfield.andM;A  Basically, if your board is still under warranty you're eligible for areplacement.andP;  If not, Tandon will only sell you a complete new board.andM;Nonetheless, you're welcome to act independently and put another chip in.andO;But beware -- make sure that is meets all the specifications and (I guess) itwon't be guaranteed.andM;Q  Could you recommend a general book on relational databases?andM;Our staff have banks-on experience of SQL but lack the basic-levelinformation on what a relational database is and what it can do.andP;  They needsomething to flesh out the learning skeleton, without having to ploughthrough great volumes.andP;  Any ideas?andP;  Paul Coutts-Smith, The WellcomeFoundation.andM;A  Butterworth Heinemann has recently published the Students' Guide toDatabases, by Malcolm Bull.andP;  It's one of a range of textbooks coveringgeneral computing topics, and although it's aimed at college students, itcould be just the thing.andM;Although it covers all kinds of databases, there are a couple of chaptersspecific to the relational kind.andP;  The Students' Guide is a paperback andcosts a moderate 10.95 pounds.andP;  Butterworth Heinemann is on (0865) 311366.andM;World of WordPerfectandM;Editing macrosandM;WordPerfect has a built-in macro editor that enables you to amend your macrowithout having to rewrite it.andP;  This is accessed by pressing macro define(Ctrl-F10) and entering your macro name.andP;  Take the option to edit from theALTS.WPM is Already Defined.andP;  1 Replace; 2 Edit: or ALTS.WPM Already Exists:1 Replace; 2 Edit; 3 Description: prompt.andM;(DISPLAY OFF) Yours.Sincerely(Enter) (Enter) (Enter) (Bold)(Underline)Richard.Roberts(Underline) (Bold)andM;How to edit the macroandM;When editing the macro you can use the normal WordPerfect cursor movements tomove or delete.andP;  Enters and tabs are ignored and can be used to make themacro more readable.andM;Pressing Enter will start a new line, and tab will move text several spacesto the right.andP;  Spaces appear as dots to distinguish them from tabs.andM;Function keys will enter the command for that keystroke, that is, F2 willgive {Search} The only exceptions to this are Cancel (F1) and Exit (F7) whichact as normal.andP;  If you wish to enter these, or any other cursor movementkeys, press Ctrl-V followed by the key you want.andP;  This gives {Cancel},{Exit}, {Left}, {Enter}, {Tab} and so on.andP;  This will work for just one keypress.andP;  To turn this mode on permanently, press the macro define key(Ctrl-10).andP;  The Press Macro Define to enable editing message appears.andP;  Thiswill remain active until you toggle it off with Ctrl-F10.andP;  There's nokeystroke within a macro for {Macro Define} since a macro can't define amacro.andM;The macro commands key (Ctrl-PgUp) gives a box in the top right-hand side ofthe screen where you can scroll through the programming commands.andM;To save any changes press the Exit key (F7) until you get back to the mainediting screen.andP;  To abandon any changes press the Cancel (F1) key.andM;Corrections and amplificationsandM;The surgeons gratefully received the following correspondence regardingvarious problems in previous Clinics.andM;A  When I saw your answer to the 'missing COUNTRY.SYS' message in issue 138 Ithought I wouldn't write because someone else was bound to tell you it waswrong.andP;  Having just read the corrections section of the Clinic in issue 140,however, it seems that you still think that COUNTRY.SYS and KEYBOARD.SYSshould be put into the CONFIG.SYS file as DEVICE drivers, This is wrong tothe extent that if you do this the PC will hang, and because the problem isin the CONFIG.SYS file, it'll require a reboot from a system disk.andM;Both are input files to DOS configuration options.andP;  COUNTRY.SYS is used bythe optional COUNTRY= line in the CONFIG.SYS file using the syntax:COUNTRY=044{, codepage}{PATHNAME}{COUNTRY.SYS}andM;where the brackets denote optional parameters.andP;  If the path and filename ofthe COUNTRY.SYS file aren't specified it will look for the file in the rootdirectory.andP;  If it isn't there it will display the message MISSINGCOUNTRY.SYS.andP;  If the codepage parameter is omitted then two commas must beentered before the pathname.andP;  Incidentally, the country number (044 for theUK) is based on the international telephone dialling codes from the US -- whythey couldn't make it something logical like COUNTRY=UK, I don't know.andM;The KEYBOARD.SYS file is used by the KEYB.COM program which is usually put inthe AUTOEXEC.BAT file -- certainly not in CONFIG.SYS.andP;  The syntax is: KEYBUK{{pathname}{KEYBOARD.SYS}andM;If the optical path and filename is omitted, the KEYBOARD.SYS file must be inthe current logged directory.andP;  Usually (on our machines) this is the root.andM;It's a shame that Microsoft couldn't maintain some kind of standard for filenaming.andP;  Giving a file an extension of .SYS doesn't mean it's a device driverfor the CONFIG.SYS file and leads to confusion, as illustrated in Clinic.andO;The two offending files should have been called COUNTRY.DAT and KEYBOARD.DATbecause that's what they are -- data files for COUNTRY= and KEYB.COM.andP;  JohnEllison, Powys.andM;A  Concerning R Potter's problem with printer output redirection (page 133,issue 142), I notice that he's used the command MODE LPT:COM1.andM;The correct use of the command is: MODE LPT1:=COM1:andM;John Hollerton, Stevenage, Herts.andM;* We received another suggestion solution to this problem:andM;A  Changing the first mode command as follows might help: MODECOM1:96,N,7,1,PandM;The trailing P signifies continuous retry on timeout at the serial port,which is sometimes necessary for printers.andP;  S T Elliot, Seismograph Service,Keston, Kent.andM;World of dBaseandM;As dBase IV 1.1 has shipped recently, Ashton-Tate has been receiving a lot ofqueries from users who've upgraded from dBase IV 1.0.andP;  Here are some of themost common queries:andM;Q  If I didn't install cacheing when I installed dBase IV 1.1, can I use itnow?andM;A  You can install disk cacheing subsequent to installing the product byentering: CACHEDB [EXT|LIM|OFF] (One parameter only) from the DOS prompt,where EXT indicates extended memory cacheing, LIM indicates expanded memorycacheing and OFF indicates no cacheing.andM;Then every time dBase is run, the cache will be loaded if you've specifiedeither EXT of LIM.andM;Q  How can I get a POPUP 'pick-list' with a list of choices when I enterdata?andM;A  Create a screen form and use the POPUP function provided in the new formgenerator with version 1.1 When adding a field that requires a pick-list,select the EDIT option, select the ACCEPT VALUE WHEN option, then enter thefollowing: &quot;POPUP&quot;=fieldname ORDER tagname [REQ] [SHADOW]&quot;andM;Where filename is a database file where the values to be chosen are held, andfieldname is the name of the field in andless;filenameandgt; which will appear in thepick-list.andP;  There should be an index tag on this field and you should supplythe tagname.andP;  If data has to be entered in the field, you can enter REQ.andO;Also, if you want a shadow around the POPUP pick-list, you can enter SHADOW.andO;Note the REQ and SHADOW clauses are optional.andM;Q  Why do I get the message 'Cannot recompile andless;filenameandgt;, source filemissing' when I try to run my report in dBase IV 1.1?andM;A  All object files created in dBase IV 1.0 need to be recompiled in 1.1.andO;Therefore, you need to copy the source files into the same directory wherethe object files reside.andP;  Running the source will cause the object files torecompile.andP;  This applies to reports, labels, forms, queries and programs.andM;ContactsandM;* Butterworth Heinemann is on (0865) 311366andM;* Barco Cameron is on (0734) 311366andM;* Maxtor Europe is on (0483) 729814andM;* Maxtor Colorado is on (0101) 303 651 6000andM;* Microsoft technical support is on (0734) 507624 or for Windows 3.0 is on(0734) 391123andM;* Ashton-Tate is on (0628) 331123andM;* Supply Technology is on (081) 842 3388andM;* Lotus Development is on (0784) 455445andM;* Symantec is on (0628) 776343andM;* Wordperfect is on (0923) 231164andM;* Tandon is on (0527) 550550</TEXT></DOC>
