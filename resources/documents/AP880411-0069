The United Nations has asked the World Court for an opinion onwhether the U.S. government must accept arbitration in the dispute,which emanates from anti-terrorist legislation signed by PresidentReagan last December.   That law, which classifies the Palestine Liberation Organizationas a terrorist group and bars it from operating on U.S. territory,led the United States to order the closing of the PLO Mission tothe United Nations, a maneuver condemned by all U.N. member nationsexcept the United States and Israel.   ``The (U.N.) secretary-general has the strong desire to avoidany confrontation with the host country,'' a U.N.undersecretary-general, Carl-August Fleischhauer of West Germany,told the World Court today.   But he stressed that the United Nations ``urges the court todeclare that indeed there is an obligation to the United States''to submit the dispute to independent arbitration.   Fleischhauer's remarks came during a 90-minute World Courthearing. Neither the United States nor the PLO was officiallyrepresented at the session.   In a recent letter to the World Court, John Shad, U.S.ambassador to the Netherlands, said his government does not``believe arbitration would be appropriate'' because the case isnow before a U.S. court.   The PLO is unable to plead its case here because only nationstates and U.N. bodies are entitled to appear before the WorldCourt.   The World Court, officially known as the International Court ofJustice, is the U.N.'s 15-member judicial branch. It has noenforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to itsrulings.   In the case now under consideration, the United Nations claimsthe United States is required to accept arbitration in the matterunder a 1947 accord between the world body and the Trumanadministration.   Under that pact, known as the Headquarters Agreement, disputesbetween the U.S. government and the United Nations arising from theU.N. presence in the United States must be settled by arbitration.   The accord calls for a three-member arbitration panel, made upof one member appointed by the U.N. secretary-general, oneappointed by the U.S. government, and one chosen by mutual consent.   Although the accord does not specifically mention missions, theUnited Nations maintains its rules concerning the unhinderedfunctioning of diplomats accredited to its headquarters in New Yorkalso apply to the missions of member nations and organizations withobserver status.   The PLO was granted non-voting observer status at the UnitedNations in 1974. It has maintained an office in Manhattan sincethen.   Several weeks ago, the U.S. Justice Department filed suit inU.S. District Court in New York after the PLO refused to close itsoffice there. The PLO was expected to respond in the U.S. casetoday, and the United Nations was expected to file a briefsupporting the PLO position.   The U.S. boycott of the World Court proceedings marks the secondtime in four years that the Reagan administration has refused totake part in one of its cases.   The U.S. government claimed the court had no authority to handlea complaint against it filed in 1984 by Nicaragua and boycotted thelast 17 months of the proceedings in that case. The World Courtultimately ruled in favor of Nicaragua, and ordered the UnitedStates to halt its support for the Contra rebels fightingNicaragua's Sandinista government.</TEXT></DOC>
