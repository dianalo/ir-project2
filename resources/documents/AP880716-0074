The 13-0 vote Friday applies to older commercial and industrialbuildings exempt from sprinkler requirements enacted in 1974.   Council members also indicated they would act to requiresprinklers in more than 100 older residential towers, but said thatmeasure would take time to develop because rent-control laws allowthe costs of sprinklers to be passed on to tenants.   ``It could translate up to $150-per-month rent increases,'' saidRichard McCaughey, a legislative analyst. ``We don't want to putlittle old ladies out on the street.''   The 62-story First Interstate Bank building was havingsprinklers installed when it caught fire. One person died and 40were injured in the blaze that gutted 4{ floors. The building wasnot subject to the 1974 sprinkler ordinance. Under the newordinance, which applies to pre-1974 buildings more than 75 feettall, or about seven stories, owners would have three years toinstall sprinklers.   An automatic one-year extension would be granted for buildingsrequiring major asbestos removal as part of the installation.   A bill in the Legislature requiring sprinklers in high-risesacross the state would give owners more time to install the devices.   Geoff Ely, executive director of the Building Owners andManagers Association of Los Angeles, said he was disappointed bythe council's action and is now pinning his hopes on the statelegislation.   Ely said his group isn't trying to stall but wants to make surethat when the sprinklers are installed they are quality systems putin by reputable contractors.</TEXT></DOC>
