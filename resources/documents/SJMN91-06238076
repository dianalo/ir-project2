(The strip runs in more than 2,000 papers in 55countries.);   Suffice it to say that Dagwood's stomach, and that of Daisy,the Bumstead dog, are indirect beneficiaries.;   Dagwood turns out to besomething of an unreconstructed male chauvinist who must be persuaded to &quot;let&quot;Blondie work outside the home. He relents in a Sunday column in which Blondie,a one-time airhead who has grown mildly cerebral over the years, shows him acost-benefit analysis.;   Dagwood perks up when Blondie says she should earn$20,000 the first year.;   The concept of Blondie applying for small-businessloans, taking on a partner (Tootsie Woodley), shopping for power suits andotherwise plunging into the workaday world has been bouncing around in Young'shead for more than a year, dating to the time of the strip's 60thanniversary.;   It was then, Young said, that a feminist feature writergrilled him about the relevance of Blondie's stay-at-home status, wonderingwhy the strip didn't more fully reflect '90s reality.;   In making the change,Young did his own research, finding that 67 percent of all American mothersnow work outside the home.;   &quot;Humor is better when it relates to the real,&quot;Young said. &quot;I just hope the readers like it, and I hope it's funny.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910825  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  357  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, August 25, 199100238076,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
