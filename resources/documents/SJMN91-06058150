As a result, the cutbacks will fall most heavily on suburbandistricts with the most landscaping and least heavily on predominantly urbanSan Francisco.;    San Francisco will receive 32 percent less than it did in1987, while the cutback to the 30 suburban districts that buy Hetch Hetchywater will average 52 percent.;    In Santa Clara County, dependence on HetchHetchy supplies varies from 100 percent of the supplies in Milpitas to 3percent for municipal water users in San Jose.;    &quot;The plan asks suburbancustomers to cut back by more than 45 percent, while San Francisco cuts backquite a bit less,&quot; said James Beard, general manager of the Alameda CountyWater District and president of the Bay Area Water Users Association, whichrepresents the suburban districts.;    &quot;San Francisco is asking its neighborsto do some very heavy lifting,&quot; Beard told the five commissioners appointed bySan Francisco Mayor Art Agnos.;    Hetch Hetchy's customers have already cutwater use by 25 percent under a plan that went into effect last August.;   The most severe cut under the new plan will fall on residents of posh LosAltos Hills and its surrounding areas. Their Purissima Hills Water Districtwill lose nearly 68 percent of the water it received in 1987. During the peaksummer months, the allotment will fall below one-quarter of normal.;    &quot;Allgardens, except rocks and cactus, will be destroyed,&quot; said Dan Alexander,president of the Purissima water board. &quot;It's a public relations disaster. Ourcustomers will hate us.&quot;;    John Mullane, general manager of the SanFrancisco Water District, which serves as the wholesaler of Hetch Hetchywater, made no apologies for the uneven distribution.;    &quot;Our program hitsoutside use and there is significantly more outside use in the Peninsula andthe suburbs than there is in San Francisco,&quot; Mullane said.;    Each waterdistrict will decide for itself how to distribute the reduced allocation,which will go into effect April 1.;    In San Francisco, single-family homeswill be limited to a maximum of 300 gallons per day and apartments to 150gallons per day, with a minimum of 50 gallons per resident. Among the newrestrictions are a ban on washing cars and filling new hot tubs and swimmingpools.;    Mullane said the allocations could be cut further if state agenciesrequire a 50 percent overall cut before allowing districts to buy water from anewly established water bank, which will buy unused water, mostly fromfarmers, to sell to hard-pressed urban areas.;    Additional cuts might alsobe required if water supplies continue to shrink. The district's projectionsare based on a spring runoff similar to 1977, the worst year on record. As ofnow, however, there is even less water than that in the Sierra snowpack thatfeeds the Hetch Hetchy system.;    Already, the reservoir has a 200-foot-widewhite bathtub ring, dramatic illustration that it is only 9 percent full.;   &quot;No matter what we do, hardships result from this plan,&quot; said Sherri Chiesa,president of the commission. &quot;There's no other choice.&quot;;    Representatives ofindustries ranging from semiconductors to sourdough to self-serve car washeslined up in the commission's meeting room in San Francisco City Hall,predicting layoffs and pleading for special treatment.;    &quot;We're concernedthat we have our fair share of water for the importance of our service to thecommunity,&quot; said Dan McIntosh, director of corporate facilities for AdvancedMicro Devices in Sunnyvale, who said layoffs are likely if water supplies arecut.;    In San Jose, directors of the Santa Clara Valley Water Districtdelayed adopting a package of stiff water use restrictions Tuesday, sendingthe proposal to the County Water Commission for its comments first.;   Directors are expected to adopt restrictions on lawn watering, swimming pools,new landscaping and other uses by mid-March, to go into effect April 1.;    Atthe same time, the board will decide whether mandatory water rationing, now at20 percent for most county residents, will be increased to as much as 45percent.; Proposed water reductions; San Francisco Water District will takeinto consideration indoor and outdoor water use of its customers when itcalculates how much it must reduce water deliveries to area cities. Thedistrict must achieve a 45 percent overall reduction based on 1987 waterconsumption. Cities that traditionally have used more water outdoors willexperience greater cuts. Here are the estimated reductions for a wet month, adry month and the projected yearly average for a few districts.; ...;Districts        March       August     Average; ...; Hayward            33%       57%          48%; Milpitas           28%        63%          52%; Mtn.View          32%        63%          52%; Palo Alto          39%        62%         53%; Purissima Hills(*)   40%        76%          68%; (*)Servescustomers in Los Altos Hills and some of northern; Santa Clara County.;Source:  Bay Area Water Users Association; Mercury News  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID BANK, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910227  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  924  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 27, 199100058150,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
