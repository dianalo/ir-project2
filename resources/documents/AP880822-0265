WHITING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Although it has plenty of oil, naturalgas, coal and other sources of energy, Indonesia is considering anuclear power plant as a backstop against the day when the otherresources won't be enough.   Supporters of the nuclear option say the country has littlechoice since electricity demand on the main island of Java isexpected to increase more than sixfold by the year 2015. Java ishome for more than 60 percent of Indonesia's 170 million people anduses 80 percent of its energy.   Opponents insist that alternative energy sources should beenough and cite safety and environmental objections to the nuclearoption. They contend that a country burdened with a $40 billionforeign debt can't realistically spend an additional billiondollars or so on nuclear power.   Three experimental nuclear reactors used for research alreadyoperate at Bandung in West Java, JogJakarta in central Java and atSerpong, 19 miles southwest of Jakarta.   Officials of the Batan, national atomic energy agency, saySerpong is the third-largest neutron-producing reactor in the worldafter Grenoble in France and Brookhaven on Long Island in New York.   Subsidized by West Germany and opened last August by PresidentSuharto, the 30-megawatt Serpong reactor is for research on fuelelements and processing of radioactive waste and producesradioisotopes for food preservation.   In opening the plant, Suharto said it was important forIndonesian scientists to learn nuclear technology.   ``When eventually our development effort requires the use ofnuclear energy to generate electricity, we will then have masteredthe technology.''   Development of nuclear power now has the government's lowestenergy priority, behind hydroelectricity, geothermal resources,coal, gas and oil. Gas and oil are regarded as mainly for exportand earn about 70 percent of the country's foreign exchange.   Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of liquified naturalgas and East Asia's biggest oil exporter with a 1.2million-barrel-a-day quota from the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries.   Proponents of nuclear power are led by Bacharuddin JusufHabibie, the Cabinet minister in charge of research and technology.He is best known for establishing aircraft manufacturing inIndonesia and is regarded as close to Suharto.   The multipurpose reactor at Serpong is one of the facilitiesprepared to support eventual development of a nuclear generatingstation, Habibie told a seminar on atomic energy in June.   He said Java will need an additional 27,000 megawatts ofelectric power by the year 2015 and available sources of supply canprovide only 20,000. Habibie also said that since it will takeseven to 10 years to build a nuclear plant, a decision should bemade soon to head off a possible power shortage.   A World Bank analysis said last year, however, that Indonesiashould delay until 1995 any decision on nuclear power.   ``For the short to medium term, a nuclear power program can't bejustified on economic grounds,'' the analysis said. It estimatedthat nuclear energy per kilowatt-hour costs at least five U.S.cents compared to three cents for conventional energy.   The World Bank report bolstered Indonesian Treasury officialswho contend that the project is too ambitious and costly.   Habibie and his opponents agree that Indonesia can't afford tofinance nuclear power through the usual commercial methods.   He proposes instead a ``build-operate-transfer'' (BOT)arrangement. Under this system a foreign contractor builds theplant, operates it for 15 years and transfers it to the governmentafter earning a reasonable return on selling electricity.   Batan, the atomic energy agency, has selected a site for a900-megawatt plant and is studying offers to build it from threeforeign consortia: Framatome of France, which is linked withKraftwerk Union of West Germany; Westinghouse, the U.S. companywhich has joined forces with Mitsubishi of Japan on the project;and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., which is cooperating with Japan'sMarubeni Corp. and Hitachi Co.   The proposed site is in central Java 285 miles east of Jakarta,not far from a dormant volcano. Java has 28 active volcanos andenvironmentalists question the wisdom of building a nuclear plantnear even a dormant one.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Friday PMs Aug. 26</NOTE></DOC>
