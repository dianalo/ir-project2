Gen. Abdul Ulumi,secretary of the Supreme Defense Council, told a news conference inthe Afghan capital. There was no immediate confirmation or denial ofhis claim.   Ulumi said at least 3,500 mujahedeen rebels had attacked thecity, just 10 miles from the border with Pakistan, where most of therebels are based. He claimed 1,000 rebels were killed and 1,000wounded in the fighting.   A rebel victory at Khost would have opened a direct rebel supplylink from Pakistan to fighters in northern and western Afghanistan.Convoys supplied at depots in Pakistan are now forced to take longroutes around Khost to reach upper Afghanistan, where thecountryside is largely controlled by the rebels. Ulumi said thefighting ended after government forces recently took back twomilitary posts at Tani, 10 miles south of the city. He would notconfirm when, but government sources said the posts were retaken infighting overnight Wednesday.   ``We are back in the positions we were in around Khost'' when theattack was launched Aug. 24, Ulumi said.   Ulumi told the mujahedeen, who have not had a significantmilitary victory since the Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistanin February after nine years of fighting, that it was futile tocontinue trying to capture the country.   ``Those who imagine they can capture Afghanistan will only taketheir coffins with them back to Pakistan,'' he said.   The mujahedeen have previously launched attacks on Kandahar, thecountry's second-largest city, and Jalalabad, a strategically vitaltown east of Kabul. Both attacks have bogged down, reflecting therebels' inability to switch from their previously successfulguerrilla tactics to more conventional warfare.   Ulumi also said the Afghan air force had acquired Soviet MiG-29jet fighters and Sukhoy-27 interceptors but had not used the planesin combat. The battle of attrition between both sides has usuallybeen confined to ground fighting, although the government has beenusing airplanes and helicopter gunships to strafe rebel positions.</TEXT></DOC>
