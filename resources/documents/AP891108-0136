KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House Ways and Means Committee expressedconcern Wednesday about the use of U.S. trade sanctions to achieveU.S. foreign policy goals, saying they work only if many countriesimpose them.   The panel urged President Bush to try to persuade other nationsto impose sanctions in support of the United States and to considerending U.S. sanctions if they do not.   The committee comments came as it endorsed pending legislationauthorizing the use of trade sanctions against foreign countries andcompanies whose actions lead to the spread or use of chemical orbiological weapons.   Several committees have jurisdiction over the legislation,endorsed earlier by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   The House version of the bill requires the president to imposesanctions against foreign companies that have substantiallycontributed to another country's ability to make or use chemical orbiological weapons.   Other sanctions could be imposed against countries obtaining orusing chemical weapons.   The bill gives the president flexibility in choosing whether toimpose sanctions and is generally weaker than legislation pending inthe Senate. It gives the president authority to waive sanctions ifhe determines that doing so is in the interest of the United States.   The Ways and Means Committee said in a policy statement thatevidence strongly indicates that sanctions are most effective whenimposed by many nations.   ``Unilateral sanctions rarely have a significant effect on thetarget country,'' the panel said, adding that sanctions imposed bythe United States alone place an ``unduly heavy burden'' on U.S.exporters and importers and give an unwarranted advantage to U.S.trading partners.   ``The committee therefore urges the administration, if it imposessanctions against a country under authority of this bill, to seekthe timely imposition of substantially similar sanctions by othermajor producers of goods and technology which can be used to make oruse chemical or biological weapons,'' the panel said.</TEXT></DOC>
