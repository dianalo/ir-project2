<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-56-0335 </DOCNO><TEXT>The spectral radiative properties of 1450(b) high density fiberglass,1451 low density fiberglass, and expanded polystyrene were inverted frommonochromatic directional-hemispherical reflectance and hemispherical-directionalreflectance data coupled with an analytical model in the wavelength rangeof 4 to 40 microns. A set of ten samples were prepared for each of thethree insulation materials. The Willey 318S Fourier transform spectrometer(DTS) was utilized to measure the directional-hemisherical reflectancedata in the wavelength range of 2-20 {mu}m for the three sample sets.The hemispherical-directional reflectance data for the two fiberglasssamples sets were obtained with a hemiellipsoidal reflectometer in thewavelength range of 4-40 {mu}m. From the directional-hemispherical reflectancedata, the spectral absorption and scattering coefficients were invertedfor the three test insualtions using the non-linear least squares approachcoupled with Chandrasekhar's discrete ordinates solution of the radiativetransport equation. These radiative properties together with the truethermal conductivity values for fiberglass and foam insulations wereused to compute typical heat transfer results which were then comparedto experimental data where available. An optimization analysis was conductedfor the fiberglass insulations to determine the bulk density at whichthe steady-state heat transfer through the fiberglass layer insulationwas a minimum. 32 refs., 37 figs., 19 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
