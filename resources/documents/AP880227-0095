DavidBoren, D-Okla., said Saturday in the weekly Democratic radioaddress.   ``This issue simply does not grab the headlines, like a foreignpolicy emergency or a financial crisis. Yet it is just asserious,'' said Boren, a principal author of the scuttled bill thatwould have set voluntary limits.   ``The way we're financing campaigns in this country is like asilent deadly cancer eating away at the very heart of ourdemocratic system. Too much money pumped into campaigns, too manyspecial interests threaten the integrity of the election processitself.''   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.V., already has said heplans to continue the quest to combat the escalating cost ofwinning Senate seats.   ``This issue will come back again and again,'' Byrd said. ``Itwill not be swept under the rug.''   A senator in the middle of the partisan battle said Democraticleaders are thinking about bringing a proposed constitutionalamendment to the floor to replace the legislation effectivelykilled by stubborn opposition from minority Republicans.   The proposed amendment that would give Congress the specificauthority, now lacking because of a 1976 Supreme Court decision, toset mandatory limits on how much federal candidates can spend oncampaigns.   ``It's a distinct and likely possibility the constitutionalamendment will surface in the next few weeks,'' said the senator,who spoke on condition of anonymity. The senator was a leader inlast week's failed effort by Democrats to get a vote on their billto set voluntary spending limits.   Byrd would not say whether he planned to push the proposedconstitutional amendment. ``That is one of the options,'' he said,and did not elaborate.   The campaign spending bill, carrying 52 of the 100 senators asco-sponsors, was scuttled for the 1988 session Friday whenDemocrats fell seven votes short of the 60 they needed to curtail aGOP talkathon and force a vote on the bill.   The 53-41 roll call represented the eighth time since last Junethat Republicans had defeated attempts by Byrd to limit debate onthe campaign spending bill.   Boren, in the radio address, called it a ``tragedy'' thatmembers of both political parties could not agree on limitingcampaign costs. He said the average cost of running a successfulrace for the U.S. Senate has gone up 500 percent in 10 years toabout $3 million and declared, ``It is time for us, all of us, towake up and speak out before it's too late.''   ``We're not going to give up, either,'' said acting minorityleader Alan Simpson, R-Wyo. ``We have slayed the dragon eighttimes. ... The deed is done, and we ought to move on to otherthings.''   Republicans refused to negotiate with Democrats over spendinglimits, saying such restrictions would doom their party to minoritystatus in states where Democrats have a big edge in voterregistration.   They offered to discuss restricting how much special-interestpolitical action committees can give to Senate candidates, butDemocrats said that without spending limits, PACs would find otherways pump money into political campaigns.   The proposed constitutional amendment has been laying fallow inthe Judiciary Committee. Its principal sponsor is Sen. ErnestHollings, D-S.C., who was not a co-sponsor of the voluntary limitsbill.   The Hollings legislation is a response to the Supreme Court'sBuckley vs. Valeo ruling in 1976 that held Congress, absent aconstitutional change, cannot restrict how much money a candidatecan on a campaign.   Hollings' proposal, which has 19 sponsors, states simply that``the Congress may enact laws regulating the amounts ofcontributions and expenditures intended to affect elections tofederal offices.''   A proposed amendment needs 67 votes to pass the Senate, asimilar two-thirds margin in the House and then ratification by atleast 38 states.   Mathematics seem to be against Byrd if he brings the Hollingslegislation to the floor. He needed 60 votes to force a roll callon the voluntary limit bill and never had more than 55, includingtwo missing from Friday's vote.   However, the sponsor mix on the Hollings bill is different thanthe one debated last week. Three of its cosponsors _ RichardShelby, D-Ala., Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. _opposed cloture.   If Byrd could hold his 55 votes and pick up these threesenators, he would need to find only two more to break any GOPfilibuster against the Hollings bill.   Once this measure came to a vote, he would have to find theother votes for passage from a handful of Republicans who are saidto support spending limits but who stayed loyal to their party'sposition against the voluntary limit proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
