 402 on Reader Service CardandM;For users of previous PC generations, upgrading to an 80386-based PC is likebeing handed a lamp holding a powerful genie.andP;  But with an 80386-based PC,users can choose which genie -- Unix or OS/2 -- they wish to have at theircommand.andM;MS-DOS was a suitable operating system for the early 8088-based machines, butits single-tasking nature and memory limitations make it inadquate for thecurrent generation of PCs.andM;The huge volume of existing DOS applications will extend DOS' life into thenear future, but eventually DOS will be supplanted by more powerful operatingsystems like Unix and OS/2.andM;Unix and OS/2 differ not only in their commands and features, but also intheir abilities to take advantage of the hardware they run on.andP;  Thistranslates into substantial differences in the time needed to develop and runapplications.andM;Of course, the operating system is not the only element that affects the waya program runs.andP;  The compiler, which changes the source life into objectcode, and the linker, which transforms the object code into an executableimage, also affect performance.andM;To test the differences between the two operating systems and developmentenvironments, DR Labs brought in OS/2 from Microsoft and IBM and Unix SystemV/386 from The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), and compared their performances ona DECstation 325c, DEC's Tandy-built, 80386-based PC.andM;We used the Microsoft Fortran 5.0 compiler with OS/2 and the LPI-Fortran 3.01compiler from Language Processros Inc., distributed by SCO, with SCO Unix.andM;One of the most important advantages both operating systems have over DOS isthe ability to take advantage of far more memory than the 640KB supported byDOS.andP;  Many users find Unix's non-mnemonic commands difficult to remember, butmany programmers love Unix because it lets them write complex routines withrelative ease.andM;Another advantage of Unix is its command-level compatibility with otherversions of the operating system on minicomputers and mainframes.andM;Though some of the commands and syntax differ slightly, programmers canunderstand diverse dialects of Unix at least as well as residents of Brooklynand East London can understand each others' dialects of English.andM;SCO Unix is one of the most popular PC operating systems.andP;  It is a full,robust implementation of Unix System V, including mail, uucp and otherutilities.andM;The operating system is composed of two main elements -- the run-time systemand the development system.andP;  The run-time system allows users to run existingSCO Unix applications.andP;  It also contains utilities for reading and copyingfiles in DOS format to and from the floppy drive.andM;The development system, which is installed on top of the run-time system,allows users to develop applications.andP;  It includes the C compiler and linklibraries.andM;Users who plan to install the full package need a good-sized hard disk.andP;  TheSCO Unix documentation indicates that the full operating system takes up morethan 27MB, the full development system requires more than 16MB, and theFortran compiler needs another 2MB -- a total of more than 45MB.andM;SPEED TRIALSandM;To test the speed of the DECstation 325c running this version of Unix, we ranour CPU 2 benchmark suite.andP;  This benchmark measures a system's performancerunning scientific and engineering applications.andM;The speed of the CPU itself, the performance of the operating system, theefficiency of the compilers and the speed of memory access all affect theoverall CPU 2 rating.andM;We compiled our Fortran kernels with the LPI-Fortran compiler.andP;  For our timerroutine, which is written in the C language, we used the C compiler thatcomes bundled with SCO's development system.andP;  We linked our benchmark suiteusing the lpild command, which is included with the Fortran compiler.andM;When we ran the benchmarks, the PHILCO kernel, which performs adouble-precision matrix inversion, was not able to run to completion.andO;Thefore, we removed the PHILCO kernel from the suite and ran the test againwith the remaining kernels.andM;The results of our tests showed the DECstation 325c weighing in at 1.61MicroVAX II units of processing (MVUPs).andP;  This result puts it on the low endof the processors we've tested, at about half the performance of a MicroVAX3100 and about two-thirds that of Apple's Macintosh IIfx (see figure).andM;TRAILING BEHIND IN THE BENCHMARKSandM;Microsoft and IBM's PC operating system of the future is OS/2.andP;  Unlike DOS,it supports multitasking.andP;  And like the operating system of the AppleMacintosh, it supports a graphical user interface as part of its design.andM;As with Unix, the OS/2 installation is controlled by the computer.andP;  The userinserts the installation diskette into the floppy drive, then turns on orreboots the sytem.andP;  A sequence of screens leads the user through the rest ofthe installation process.andM;When we tried to install IBM OS/2 version 1.2, we got an error: FDISKproblem.andP;  The message was not very helpful, nor did the manual add much toour understanding.andP;  Repeated calls to IBM also failed to bring us any help orinformation.andM;Finally, a DEC source told us that IBM's OS/2 version 1.2 does not supportSCSI drives like the one in our PC.andP;  DEC supplied us with its own version ofOS/2 1.1, to which it had added a SCSI device driver.andM;OS/2 offers a graphical user interface much like DECwindows.andM;In addition, OS/2 offers command-line modes both for OS/2 and for DOSemulation.andP;  Most DOS commands and many DOS applications are supported in thismode.andM;We used Microsoft Fortran 5.0 to compile the benchmarks under OS/2.andP;  Weconfigured it with Microsoft's large memory model and 80387 floating-pointinstructions as default options.andM;Four kernels of the benchmark suite would not run properly under OS/2.andP;  TheLUSD kernel would not compile.andP;  The LIN-PAC kernel, which performs operationson a double-precision matrix, aborted with a run-time error indicatingfloating-point overflow.andP;  The DWHET and SWHET double- and single-precisionwhetstone routines ran many times longer than any of the other kernelswithout finishing.andM;We removed all four troublesome kernels, leaving 30 fo the 34 kernels onwhich to base our conclusions.andM;The DECstation 325c achieved just 0.82 MVUPs under OS/2, the lowest ratingfor any workstation DR Labs has tested.andM;Our CPU 2 results depend on the statistical averaging of the results of eachof the suite's kernels.andP;  Because five of our 34 CPU 2 kernels would not rununder both operating systems, we also performed our statistical analysis ofthe results of the 29 kernels both operating systems were able to run.andM;Using this analysis, both operating systems showed slightly lowerperformance, with OS/2 at 0.80 MVUPs and SCO Unix coming in at 1.55 MVUPs.andM;The Microsoft documentation leaves a little to be desired.andP;  For example, theC reference manual lacks an index.andP;  Its description of how to use the Fortrancompiler to link previously compiled object files refers to &quot;libfield&quot; ratherthan &quot;libfile.&quot;andP;  Someone trying to learn how to use the linker could beconfused easily by that error.andM;Support from Microsoft was superb,  however, as was support from SCO.andO;Telephone staffs at both companies were responsive, knowledgeable andunfailingly courteous.andM;Given an installed base of 80386 PCs running DOS, we'd pick Unix as anupgrade path.andP;  In our tests, its power was far greater than OS/2's.andM;Unix also has the advantage of a wide base of programmers who are alreadyfamiliar with its commands -- an essential element, considering howfrequently programmers' jobs change.andP;  It includes an optional graphical userinterface, SCO's Open Desktop.andM;Users without an installed base of PCs have some alternatives.andP;  TheVAXstation 3100, prices at $12,950, is a multiuser system with more thantwice the CPU power of our 80386-based PC under Unix.andM;The VAXstation 3100 is compatible with the entire VAX line.andP;  It runs VMS,with its full range of system service and run-time library calls forprogrammers, as well as VMS' huge library of DEC and third-party softwarepackages.andM;Two other excellent choices are the DECstationn 2100 and Sun's Sparcstation1+, RISC systems priced under $16,000.andP;  (See &quot;A tale of two workstations,&quot;DR, May 21, page i7.)andP;  Both run versions of Unix, and clock in at more than11 MVUPs, more than seven times the power of our 80386-based PC with Unix atless than twice the price.andM;Of course die-hard DOS users can also enhance their systems with DOS Extendersoftware such as that from Phar Lap Software, along with compilers such asMicroway's Fortran and Metaware's C, that together allow programs to takeadvantage of memory above DOS' 640KB limit.andM;To compare the performances of Microsoft and IBM's OS/2 and the Santa CruzOperation's Unix System V/386, we installed each on a DECstation 325C, thenran our CPU 2 benchmark suite to see how each operating system affected thesystem's performance.andM;CPU 2 measures a system's ability to handle scientific and engineeringapplications.andP;  Its results reflect the raw speed of a CPU, the performance ofthe operating system, the efficiency of a system's Fortran compiler, and --to a lesser extent -- the speed of memory access.andP;  The results are notaffected by a system's I/O capabilities.andM;Because the CPU and access speeds were identical in our tests, thedifferences in the test results reflect the differences in the performance ofthe operating systems and compilers.andM;For our tests, we chose to use the compilers provided by the operating systemvendors.andP;  It is likely that some third-party compilers could produce codethat ran faster than the code generated by these compilers.andP;  Our aim,however, was to see what effect the operating system had on performance, sowe used each vendor's own compilers as a basis for comparison.andM;We ran our benchmarks on the DECstation 325c, a 25MHz Intel 80386-basedmicrocomputer with 640KB of main memory and 7MB of additional RAM, an Intel80387 floating-point co-processor, and a 40MB SCSI hard disk drive.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
