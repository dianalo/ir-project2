Main absentees at the new talks, scheduled for Monday inFere-en-Tardenois, 70 miles northeast of Paris, will be the KhmerRouge. The movement caused the deaths of a quarter of Cambodia's 8million people in an agrarian form of communist revolution thatbegan 1975.   In 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge.   The Sihanouk-Hun Sen meeting, the third of its kind here in thepast year, was to begin Saturday in Paris. Hun Sen asked for thedelay, according to a spokesman for Sihanouk who volunteered noreasons.   The non-communist international community refuses to recognizethe Vietamese-backed regime that has run Cambodia for 10 years.   But Sihanouk, who ruled 1941-1970, has made little headway inarranging an acceptable coalition excluding the Khmer Rouge. He hasresigned ``once and for all'' as leader of the anti-Vietnamesecoalition because it included a Khmer Rouge element.   The Hun Sen regime has the backing of the Soviet Union while theKhmer Rouge _ the biggest and most effective force fighting theVietnamese _ retain the backing of China.   Hun Sen and Sihanouk first met in Fere-en-Tardenois last Decemberand in St.Germain-en-Laye in the New Year. They came ``closer thanever to agreement,'' said Son Sann, prime minister in Sihanouk'sresistance government.   In reality the three parties remain far apart. Not even a meetingbetween high-level Chinese and Russian diplomats broke the deadlock.   Sihanouk has met most Western leaders, including PresidentReagan, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and FrenchPresident Francois Mitterrand. They see in him the main hope foragreement on an acceptable Cambodian government, which he would lead.   Sihanouk is demanding the Hun Sen government step down beforefree elections, while Hun Sen wants the elections to come before anychange to his regime. Neither side has realistically tackled theKhmer Rouge problem.   The Khmer Rouge are believed to have at least 40,000 well-armedmen in the field, compared with Sihanouk's 15,000. When Vietnam's120,000 regular soldiers leave Cambodia as promised, by 1990, theKhmer Rouge surely will try to make a comeback.   To prevent this, the United States gives Sihanouk open and covertaid of $20 million a year, though reluctantly because it is afraidof upsetting China. Southeast Asian countries, including Malaya andSingapore, also help Sihanouk.   The Khmer Rouge are the only crucial pawn China still holds inthe struggle for Cambodia. To abandon them, the Chinese leadershipexpects concessions from Moscow.</TEXT></DOC>
