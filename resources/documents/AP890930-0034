(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker testified that his dream of aChristian retreat was a vision from God, but the demands of fundraising turned it into a nightmare.   ``In the middle of the night I woke up,'' Bakker said Friday inhis first day on the witness stand for his fraud trial. ``It was avision or a dream, I don't know. God gave me the concept of theHeritage Grand Partner Center and I began to sketch it.''   The PTL founder said his biggest burden was raising funds tobuild the Heritage USA retreat and theme park near Fort Mill, S.C.,but he denied overselling partnerships in the project.   Prosecutor Deborah Smith asked Bakker why he told televisionviewers in 1984 that 50 percent of the 25,000 partnerships at theHeritage Grand Hotel were taken when computer records showed fewerthan 4,000 had been bought.   ``You were creating a false sense of urgency, weren't you, Mr.Bakker?'' Ms. Smith asked.   Bakker said PTL's computers typically ran six months behind,adding: ``If you believe the computer records of Heritage USA, Icould sell you land under water in Florida.''   Bakker is accused of fleecing followers of $158 million byoverselling ``lifetime partnerships'' at the ministry. The $1,000partnerships entitled bearers to three nights lodging annually inPTL facilities.   Defense attorneys have claimed that the partnerships were notsales transactions and that the money paid for them were gifts tothe ministry.   Earlier in the trial, the prosecution presented several PTLpartners who said they sometimes were turned away when they triedto use their lodging benefits. Prosecutors contend Bakker pocketed$3.7 million of proceeds to fund his lavish lifestyle.   On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter said Bakkerdid not have proof to back up his calculations that there was roomfor 211,062 lifetime partners. The judge refused to allow a chartdisplaying the calculations to be presented to the jury.   Bakker faces 120 years in prison and fines of more than $5million if found guilty on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.   The evangelist often responded to prosecutors' questions bysaying he could not recall, had not been informed or that hebelieved what he told television viewers.   When Bakker said he could not recall getting a $50,000 Christmasbonus in 1986, Smith said, ``Had your lifestyle become soextravagant that you wouldn't have noticed a $50,000 bonus?''   ``I did not look at my checkbook for several years,'' Bakkersaid.   Bakker also testified that fund raising at the ministry became anightmare.   ``I think fund raising was my most burdensome job,'' he said.   ``It never left me. You never ever, ever get away from thepressure that you have to raise funds for next week, next month,next year,'' he said.   Bakker, who was briefly hospitalized during the trial after hewas reported to be suffering from hallucinations, took the standafter his lawyers had presented more than 70 witnesses in hisdefense.   Neither his wife, Tammy Faye, nor his two children were in thecourtroom.   In a low voice, Bakker described the roots of his PTL ministry,which he resigned in a sex and money scandal in 1987. He thendescribed his vision to build the 2,400-acre Heritage USA.   Bakker testified that he ``had confidence in God'' to supplymoney for Heritage USA. When he left PTL, he said, the ministry'sbudget was $160 million a year, ``which I think boils down to $3million a week.''   He also described his supervision of PTL's television network,the Inspirational Network. ``When I left PTL, it was the largestChristian network in the world,'' he said.   ``TV is the most powerful medium in the world today,'' he saidat another point. ``I felt the message of Jesus Christ should bepropagated over that medium.''</TEXT></DOC>
