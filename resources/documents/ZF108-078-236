Unfortunately,that preservation doesn't permit AutoCAD for the Mac to have a true Macinterface flavor.andP;  This is probably the toughest of the three programs for aMac-only user to learn.andM;The text command window and the drawing's horizontal command menu, standardon PCs, are accompanied on the Macintosh by pull-down menus.andP;  You can directa good part of the action from these pull-down menus, but you'll findyourself typing many command details anyway.andP;  For example, you can choosePlot from a pull-down menu, but then the selection of what and how to plotmust be typed on the keyboard.andP;  You'll notice that pull-down commands oftenmerely initiate macros that type commands on the command line, slowingperformance.andM;There are no scroll bars on the graphics window; object selection doesn'tfollow Mac standard practice; cut, copy and paste are not fully implemented;and many dialog boxes avoid Mac conventions.andP;  There is no tool palette withicons.andP;  On the other hand, you can customize the menus any way you like.andP;  Youcan also build menus for a drawing tablet, which would let you avoid thescreen's command tangle.andP;  However, AutoCAD doesn't support the Mac's AppleDesktop Bus (ADB) port, so any tablet must be plugged into the printer ormodem port.andM;Two-dimensional drafting has long been AutoCAD's turf, and the Mac versionoffers most of the basic features you'd expect and many that you'd hope for.andO;Zooming is flexible and fast, and Undo works through multiple steps on justabout any AutoCAD operation (some CAD programs only undo new objects anddeletions, not object manipulations).andP;  There are some curious lapses, though,such as no rectangle-drawing primitive, no double-line tool, no dynamictangents or perpendiculars, and a trim command that doesn't automaticallytrim lines at intersections.andP;  Grouping objects isn't as smooth as with mostMac drawing programs, you can't paste in PICT graphics from the Clipboard,and there is only one fill pattern, although a number of hatch options areavailable.andP;  All visible layers are editable -- there's no way to lock alayer.andP;  Objects cannot be selected by attribute.andP;  And there are no PostScriptor QuickDraw text fonts.andP;  All these deficiencies can be remedied by AutoLISProutines, but that slows performance and forces you to buy third-partysoftware or write them yourself.andM;Release 10 of AutoCAD has commands for 3-D drafting, wire-frame modeling andsome surface modeling, but it doesn't make these tasks easy.andP;  There areextruded and ruler surfaces; quadratic, cubic and Bezier mesh surfaces;surfaces of revolution; tabulated cylinders; surface patches; and 3-Dpolylines as well as a few standard 3-D objects.andP;  To use them, you must learnand understand the flexible viewing and perspective options, and the surfacenode placement commands.andP;  You customize views with a user-coordinate systemand all views appear in a single window, limiting the practical number.andO;Hidden-line removal is an option, but there are no shading abilities or truesolids modeling -- these wait for Mac versions of the separate AutoShade andAutoSolid modules, which may coincide with Release 11 of the program orappear independently in late 1990.andP;  Nor are there animation abilities forwalk-through or fly-by views.andP;  3-D work isn't fast; even the dialog boxes forit are sometimes annoyingly slow to appear because they are drawn withvectors instead of standard QuickDraw rasters.andM;Overall, AutoCAD offers the best compatibility with PCs and a huge installedbase across PCs, workstations and Macs.andP;  It starts with a time-testedplatform and adds extensible and flexible menus, commands and routines.andO;Powerful 3-D operations are added to a firm 2-D base, although they aren'tsmoothly integrated or easy to use.andP;  Also, there are some empty drawers inthe drafting toolbox when compared with MacBRAVO! or MicroStation Mac.andP;  Butthe biggest difference is in the interface: AutoCAD has the least Mac-likeinterface of the three programs compared here.andP;  This won't matter to AutoCADfans coming from other platforms, and it might not matter to a drafter whowill use it day in and day out, but it will surely matter to the infrequentuser or the dyed-in-the-wool Macintosh user.andP;  The overhead of the graphicinterface cuts AutoCAD's speed, too.andP;  It will probably feel slow to a PC useraccustomed to the zip of a specialized display-list graphics controller.andO;AutoCAD is slower than both MacBRAVO! and MicroStation Mac.andM;MacBRAVO!andP;  2.0.andP;  Schlumberger's line of CAD software dates back to 1969 andused to be offered under the name Applicon.andP;  The flagship program, Bravo3,runs on VAX minicomputers and workstations.andP;  MacBRAVO! is a Macintosh subsetof Bravo3 and is marketed as a series of programs.andP;  Detailer is a mechanicaldrafting program for 2-D design.andP;  Modeler is a 3-D modeling package thatbuilds on Detailer.andP;  IGES is an independent file translation utility.andO;MacBRAVO!andP;  Design is a bundle containing all three modules at a discountedprice.andP;  MacBRAVO! asks for the most hardware of the packages in this review,requiring a Mac II with 5 Mbytes of RAM (8 Mbytes are recommended) and a40-Mbyte hard disk.andP;  The program's on-line help comes as a HyperCard stack,but since it includes HyperEngine, you can use it directly from MacBRAVO!andO;without MultiFinder.andP;  Version 2.0 of MacBRAVO! adds the ability to sharefiles with Bravo3 across an Ethernet LAN.andM;MacBRAVO!andP;  2.0 is the least integrated package of the three in this review.andO;Drafting is done in Detailer, modeling in Modeler, plotting in four separateutilities (one each for Hewlett-Packard, Houston Instruments, Schlumbergerand LaserWriter output), on-line help in a HyperCard stack and IGEStranslation in four more utilities (one each for moving files to and fromDetailer and Modeler).andP;  DXF (Drawing Interchange Format) import and export ispart of the Detailer package.andP;  MacBRAVO! follows the Macintosh interface moreclosely than AutoCAD does, but less closely than MicroStation.andP;  For example,the tool-category palette that in turn leads to more-specific tool palettescould come from any Mac drawing program.andP;  The actual display window forimages, however, doesn't have scroll bars or standard element selection byclicking.andP;  Cut, copy and paste apply only to text.andP;  There are standard dialogboxes and separate palettes for setting dimension options or crosshatching.andO;Pop-up menus for color and selection constraints (such as intersection,incremental and tangent) are available in Detailer.andP;  Choices you make inpop-up menus and palettes prompt text window commands.andM;MacBRAVO! also has a couple of interesting interface features unique inMacintosh CAD.andP;  You can bring up the Constraints menu by a &quot;click and a half&quot;anywhere on the display, an interface fillip popular in workstation CAD.andP;  Andholding down the Option key while dragging the mouse through a certain shapelets you zoom or change views.andM;The Detailer offers primitives and editing commands through typed input ormouse position.andP;  There are fillets and chamfers, grid and scale settings,trims and extensions, seven standard crosshatch patterns and a custom-patternoption, layers, movement, rotation, and mirroring of objects or groups.andO;Classes set visibility by major drawing-element types such as dimensions,annotations and geometric objects.andP;  Files can be used as templates or asshape &quot;symbols&quot; within new files.andP;  Customization comes through the FIT(Flexible Interface Tool) programming language and by editing the text filesthat configure MacBRAVO!andP;  A separate FIT developers' package is available.andP;  AJournal file of FIT commands can be kept automatically to re-create a worksession.andM;Detailer has text for annotating drawings but doesn't offer standard Mac textfonts and styles.andP;  The Dimensions palette offers linear, angular and radialautomatic dimensions as well as several formats, but not associativedimensions that change when an object changes.andP;  The Detailer has 3-D commandsfor loading Modeler or Bravo3 drawings into a 3-D window, where you canrotate them and generate 2-D views of the model.andP;  Unfortunately, throughoutall Detailer work you can see only a single window and drawing view at atime.andP;  There are six standard views, including one 3-D view.andM;Modeler follows the same interface and commands scheme as Detailer,exchanging 3-D primitives for 2-D, adding surface creation commands andletting you fill the single window with a choice of view ports to look at amodel from different angles.andP;  There's also the option of creating, naming andactivating Work planes to define the local coordinates for 3-D models.andO;Hidden-line removal and shading commands, including lighting controls, arepart of Modeler as well.andM;In sum, MacBRAVO! isn't as fast as MicroStation, but the Detailer can outrunAutoCAD, and the Modeler at least matches it.andP;  Both have very precise 64-bitIEEE-standard (Institute of Electrical andamp; Electronic Engineers) floating-point3-D databases.andP;  MacBRAVO! has a big demand for RAM; many independent filesand programs between drafting, modeling, translating and plotting; and lacksexplicit digitizer support and associative dimensioning.andP;  Also, a year oftelephone support from Schlumberger can cost $495.andP;  But there are lots ofdrawing primitives and editing commands, an extension language, shadingcontrols with lighting, and both IGES and DXF support.andP;  The Bravo3 line alsoprovides links to CAM software.andP;  MacBRAVO! will certainly sound good toBravo3 users and is a viable competitor for AutoCAD and MicroStation.andM;MicroStation Mac 3.5.andP;  Intergraph is one of the largest CAD companies in theworld, and its IGDS (Intergraph Geometric Design System) software forworkstations is well-known in the corporate arena.andP;  MicroStation Mac 3.5 is adirect descendant of IGDS, as is MicroStation for the PC, and is fullycompatible with it.andP;  MicroStation is aimed largely at mechanical engineersand architects.andP;  It combines drafting, wire-frame and full-surface modelingabilities with shading and rendering.andM;MicroStation demands the least RAM of the three heavyweights, asking for only2.5 Mbytes.andP;  However, it is the only one of these programs with acopy-protection scheme: an ADB port hardware key.andM;MicroStation's interface is not only fully Mac-standard but also adds sometouches that could define future Mac interface guidelines.andP;  For example,there's a Command Browser window that resembles the browser of the NeXTworkstation.andP;  Here, you select command categories, then individual commands,then parameters for the commands, all by scrolling and clicking on lists.andM;MicroStation also implements standard Clipboard object selection and cut,copy and paste schemes, including putting handles on objects for mousemanipulation.andP;  Full support for ADB input tablets also is provided.andP;  Up toeight active views can be open in independent windows, with different layersvisible in each.andP;  Because the windows are all active, you can start a drawingoperation in one and finish it in another.andP;  MicroStation also hashierarchical pop-up menus and standard dialog boxes with pop-up lists,providing a familiar feel to any Mac user.andP;  Standard Macintosh text fonts andstyles are there, too.andP;  You can stick with your mouse much more than inAutoCAD.andP;  Perhaps the only drawback to MicroStation's interface is crowding:There are too many palettes, menus, dialog boxes, tools and options.andO;Sometimes, a dozen of them will be visible at one time.andP;  To keep organizedwith MicroStation, you truly need a 19-inch display or a second monitor.andM;A User Command Operator language and macros are available to extend andcustomize MicroStation Mac.andP;  For those with even more programming in mind,Bentley Systems, with Intergraph, offers Micro-CSL, a Customer SupportLibrary of C-callable routines for developing specific applications.andP;  There'salso support for links to the Oracle database for analyzing information in amodel.andP;  The ability to read and write PICT and DXF files is built in, butthere is no built-in IGES support.andP;  Seed files save settings andconfigurations for use when starting new drawings.andP;  Seed files forarchitecture, mapping and mechanical engineering come with MicroStation.andO;Continuous saving is another valuable option, in which changes are saved todisk as they are made.andM;Drafting and modeling are smoothly linked in MicroStation.andP;  There arehundreds of primitives and hundreds of commands to feed the two processes.andO;Choices abound.andP;  Even in simple line attributes, there are 16 weights, 256colors and eight styles.andP;  When placing a point, you can use tentativesnapping, which shows you where the point will fall but lets you nix the actbefore it's finished.andP;  For object selection, you can work with severalfencing styles (ways to draw a marquee around objects).andP;  The Undo command canwork back to the beginning of drawing, and you can directly edit objectattributes or customize auxiliary coordinate systems in a dozen ways.andP;  A CellLibrary contains hundreds of useful patterns, especially for architecture.andO;You can choose to paste and copy from a PICT file or from the Clipboard, savethe result as an object or bit map, and scale and rotate it.andP;  For 3-D work,MicroStation offers wire-frame and surface primitives and commands,hidden-line removal, shading, and lighting controls for all or part of adrawing.andM;A crucial advantage of MicroStation for networked design teams is itsReference file capability.andP;  Any drawing can have a Reference file and up to32 attached drawing files, each drawing file with 63 layers.andP;  Changes made tothe attached files dynamically update over the network to any MicroStationsite -- PC, Mac or workstation -- that's working from the same Referencefile.andP;  That can save a lot of communication time and document managementfrustration for a workgroup.andP;  For the individual, MicroStation is fast,opening files and zooming in half the time of AutoCAD.andM;There is no utility for gathering and animating rendered images forwalk-through or fly-by presentations.andP;  And for drafting, the AutomaticDimensioning feature in MicroStation may offer a wealth of formattingoptions, but they aren't associative or easy to understand -- a majorweakness compared with the other programs reviewed here.andP;  Another hole in theMicroStation fabric is that although you can measure lengths, angles andareas, there are no analysis commands for moments of inertia or othersophisticated mechanical attributes of a model or object.andP;  Nor is there anyon-line help in sorting out the hundreds of commands and options.andM;Clearly, if you're working with IGDS on VAX minicomputers, MicroStation wouldbe the best way to add Macintoshes.andP;  Along with MacBRAVO! it offers moreworkgroup and network support than AutoCAD or most other Mac CAD packages.andO;There are a few missing pieces, noted above, but MicroStation Mac is fast,smoothly integrates 2-D and 3-D work, offers multiple active windows, adheresto the Mac style, and has a long list of features.andM;Conclusions.andP;  How do you choose between high-end drafting and modelingprograms such as these? Features and speed aren't the only benchmarksanymore.andP;  All these programs have a huge repertoire of commands, but youshould look at your particular task to see if that special dimensioningtalent, rendering ability or crosshatching feature you need is in the programyou're considering.andP;  Certainly, speed always matters, but the raw time ittakes to zoom a screen must be put in the context of the time it takes tocall up a symbol, refer to a base layer, move files from one system toanother, and communicate with other steps in the design process.andM;Macintosh CAD is rarely isolated anymore.andP;  If you work in a shop, or withcolleagues and clients who have a particular system, you should seriouslyconsider following their lead as long as their program of choice has thefeatures you absolutely need.andP;  Also remember that wanting a comfortableinterface is not just a whim -- it's vital to productivity, whether youprefer a full, graphically rich Mac-standard interface or a crisp, PC-styletext command window.andP;  These three programs take different approaches toorganizing and presenting the many commands a designer needs.andM;AutoCAD, MicroStation Mac and Mac-BRAVO! dominate the high end in generalMacintosh CAD products, along with Versacad Corp.'s VersaCAD (see MacWEEK,April 29, 1988).andP;  These products have similar feature sets for 2-D draftingand 3-D modeling, and go for similarly hefty prices: about $3,000.andM;Autodesk Inc.'s AutoCAD, the slowest of the three programs reviewed here, hasan impressive 3-D foundation that's hard to use, doesn't offer surfaceshading and swerves furthest from the standard Macintosh interface (althoughthis may be just what experienced AutoCAD users want).andP;  However, Auto-CAD hasthe largest third-party market, especially in the IBM arena, and an easilycustomized or specialized command set and interface.andM;Schlumberger CAD/CAM Division's MacBRAVO! suffers somewhat from having itsdrafting, modeling, plotting and file translation functions split intoindependent programs, and lapses from the Macintosh standard interface inplaces.andP;  On the other hand, MacBRAVO! earns high marks for extensive drawingand editing commands, HyperCard-based on-line help, an extension language,DXF (Drawing Interchange Format) and IGES (initial graphics exchangespecification) support, and direct compatibility with Bravo3 minicomputer CADsoftware across a network.andM;Intergraph Corp.'s MicroStation Mac is the fastest of the three productsreviewed here, and it follows the Macintosh style most closely.andP;  It has anextensive set of commands, an extension language and promising connections todatabase managers.andP;  MicroStation also offers the most concrete workgroup CADsupport: Its Reference file and binary compatibility allow several designersto work on the same model, on different computers on a network, all at thesame time.andM;The environment you're buying for is a critical factor in the CAD purchasedecision, but putting that consideration aside, we found MicroStation thebest bet for all-around 2-D drafting and 3-D modeling.andM;Autodesk Inc.andM;AutoCAD Release 10: $3,000andM;2320 Marinship Way, Sausalito, Calif.andP;  94965; (415) 332-2344andM;Intergraph Corp.andM;MicroStation Mac 3.5: $3,300andM;One Madison Industrial Park, Huntsville, Ala.andP;  35807; (205) 772-2000andM;Schlumberger Technologies, CAD/CAM DivisionandM;MacBRAVO!andP;  2.0: $1,495 (Modeler); $1,995 (Detailer); $495 (IGES); $3,295 (allthree modules)andM;4251 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Mich.andP;  48106; (313) 995-6000</TEXT></DOC>
