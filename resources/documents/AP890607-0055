During Tuesday's three-hour operation at St. Francis MedicalCenter, surgeons drained a pancreatic abscess, the suspected sourceof the persistent infection, said Eugene Tiwanak, the hospital'sassistant administrator.   Following surgery, Marcos, 71, remained in very criticalcondition as he has been since May 18 when he was readmitted to theintensive care unit with a variety of serious ailments, Tiwanak said.   An infection had plagued Marcos for the past few weeks. Doctorsbelieved it was centered in his abdomen but were not sure of itsexact location, Tiwanak said.   ``They felt his condition was worsening and they needed to do theexploratory surgery,'' he said, adding they were not certain ifthere are other sources of infection.   Doctors hoped to see some improvement in his condition today, hesaid.   Marcos agreed to the surgery after doctors explained that testsindicated an infection, said Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza.   ``They did it cautiously. They went through several X-rays andseveral scans first,'' Aruiza said. ``The surgery was a good call.''   Joe Lazo, an ardent supporter, said he saw Marcos after thesurgery, and saw him ``resting comfortably. He is sleeping, but helooks good.''   Marcos' wife, Imelda, was at his bedside Tuesday night, Lazo said.   Marcos, who was hospitalized Jan. 15, has been suffering fromkidney and heart failure, pneumonia and bacterial infections and hasbeen undergoing kidney dialysis. He breathes with the aid of arespirator.   On May 23, his doctors said it was a miracle he was still alive.   Marcos has lived in Honolulu since his ouster from thePhilippines in a popular revolt in February 1986.   His illness has prevented him from traveling to New York to faceracketeering charges alleging he plundered his homeland of more than$100 million and used the money to buy real estate and art in theUnited States.   Mrs. Marcos, who also is charged, last month appealed toPhilippine President Corazon Aquino to allow her husband to die inhis homeland. The request was denied.</TEXT></DOC>
