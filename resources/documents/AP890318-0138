A nationwide survey conducted by the Los Angeles Times found that80 percent of Americans favored banning such weapons. A Newsweekpoll showed that 72 percent favor a permanent ban on selling them,while 21 percent opposed such a ban.   The Times poll found opposition to the sale and possession of therapid-firing weapons across political, ethnic, gender, geographicaland educational lines, said survey director I.A. Lewis.   However, given several suggestions for how to remove the gunsfrom society, respondents split three ways. Twenty-four percent saidthe guns should be confiscated from present owners, 30 percentsupported buying the guns back and 30 percent would allow presentowners to keep their guns but ban new sales.   More than half of the 1,158 people polled in the Times' telephonesurvey said only law-abiding citizens would obey the ban, leavingthe weapons mainly in the hands of criminals.   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 or 4 percentagepoints, Lewis said.   According to the Newsweek poll, 58 percent of Americans believe aban would reduce the number of killings by unstable people, themagazine said. However, half of those polled said they did notbelieve such a ban would reduce drug- or crime-related killings,while 45 percent said they believe it would help.   Seventy-eight percent of those surveyed said they believe peopleshould be required to provide more information to police before theyare allowed to buy any kind of firearm, while 15 percent said theybelieve current laws are adequate.   The telephone pole of 756 adults was conducted March 16-17 andhas a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.   The issue gained national prominence in January after a suicidalgunman killed five children and wounded 30 other people in aStockton schoolyard.   The California Assembly has approved a bill banning 40 types ofassault weapons and the Bush Administration has imposed a temporaryban on the import of foreign-made assault weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
