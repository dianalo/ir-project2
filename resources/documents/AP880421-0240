Stephen Gold and Robert Schifreen were arrested separately in1985 for breaking into the Prestel system, the information serviceof British Telecom, the nation's telephone company.   Gold, of Sheffield, and Schifreen, of London, were convicted in1986 of nine offenses and fined $1,140 and $1,425, respectively.   Five Law Lords of the House of Lords, members of an unelectedupper legislative chamber who have expertise as judges, unanimouslyupheld a Court of Appeals ruling last year that said the two mencould not be prosecuted as charged under the Forgery andCounterfeiting Act.   ``Their conduct amounted in essence to dishonestly gainingaccess to the relevant Prestel data bank by a trick,'' said LordGeoffrey Lane. ``That is not a criminal offense. If it is thoughtdesirable to make it so, that is a matter for the legislaturerather than the courts.''   ``I knew from the start that the Forgery Act is not designed toapply to unauthorized access to computers and that has now beenproved,'' said Schifreen. ``I am not saying computer hacking shouldbe legal, but there should be a specific law to cover it.''   He said the messages left on Prince Philip's computer were not``terribly interesting,'' mostly congratulations on the birth ofhis grandson Prince William, the elder son of Prince Charles andPrincess Diana.</TEXT></DOC>
