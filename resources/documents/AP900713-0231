The increase comes on the heels of a 7.1-percent rise inlate-June sales by the Big Three. The two increases, both based onstrong truck sales, support speculation earlier this year that theauto industry will begin to pull out of its early 1990 slumpsometime in the middle of the year.   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. saidtheir combined car and truck sales averaged 33,850 a day July 1-10this year, compared with a daily average of 33,504 last year.   A 6.3 percent rise in truck sales offset a 2.3 percent declinein car sales.   Light truck sales by GM and Ford during the period rose 18.2percent and 6.1 percent, respectively. Truck sales by Chryslerdropped 13.9 percent.   Chrysler, which has been struggling financially, gets a largepercentage of its vehicle profits from its minivans and Jeeps, bothclassified as light trucks.   Drawing an accurate conclusion about a trend in the industryfrom two 10-day sales periods is difficult. Industry observersprefer to see at least a month's worth of sales figures beforespeculating about where the industry is heading.   Despite the recent back-to-back increases, car and truck salesfor the Big Three are lagging behind last year.   The companies said they sold an average 33,061 vehicles a day sofar this year, compared with 35,308 in the same period last year, a6.4 percent decrease. Car sales were down 9.5 percent and trucksales were off 1.3 percent.   Chrysler was the only one of the Big Three whose combined carand truck sales fell during early July. The nation's third-largestautomaker reported a 16.3 percent drop in vehicle sales as thedecline in truck sales combined with an 18.8 percent decrease incar sales.   So far this year, sales of Chrysler's domestic cars and truckswere down 13.2 percent.   Sales of GM vehicles in early July were running 6.7 percentahead of last year's pace. Car sales by the nation's largestautomaker were up 0.9 percent. GM's vehicle sales this year weredown 3.1 percent from last year.
