ATandamp;T has sold about 20% of its Unix software business to11 companies, including four from Japan, two from Europe andfour from the U.S., according to individuals close to ATandamp;T.</LP><TEXT>   It remains to be seen, however, whether the new investors,whose participation has been long anticipated, will bolsterATandamp;T's Unix design in its competition with a versionchampioned by the Open Software Foundation led byInternational Business Machines Corp.   &quot;I don't think this will make much of a difference,&quot; saidStewart Alsop, editor of P.C. Letter, a computer industrynewsletter based in Redwood City, Calif. In fact, he said,&quot;It could hurt, with so many players involved, if ATandamp;Tfocuses on the players instead of the product.&quot;   The individuals close to ATandamp;T couldn't say how much eachcompany had purchased of the unit, called Unix SystemLaboratories Inc. They did say ATandamp;T had valued the company atabout $325 million, giving the total investment by the newpartners a value of about $65 million.   ATandamp;T, which declined to comment on the expectedannouncement, plans to sell 10% of Unix System Laboratoriesto its employees and retain between 60% and 70%, oneindividual said.   The investor group is heavily Japanese either directly orindirectly through affiliates, the individual said. Investorsinclude Japan's NEC Corp., Fujitsu Ltd., Toshiba Corp. andOki Electric. Others are Britain's International ComputersLtd., which is 80%-owned by Fujitsu, and Ing. C. Olivetti andamp;Co. of Italy. The four U.S. companies are Fujitsu affiliateAmdahl Corp., Motorola Inc., Novell Inc. and Sun MicrosystemsInc. The identity of the 11th investor couldn't beascertained.   Many of the investors were unavailable for comment on theannouncement, except for Amdahl and Motorola, which confirmedthey are investors. Sun, Novell and Toshiba declined tocomment.   ATandamp;T has been sparring with the IBM-led group for controlof the increasingly popular operating system developed byATandamp;T Bell Laboratories. IBM and others have complained thatATandamp;T's ownership of the Unix system gives ATandamp;T an unfair edgeover competitors also using Unix.   ATandamp;T aimed to diffuse such criticism by spreading Unix'sownership among a wider group, a plan that arose about thetime IBM formed Open Software.   The foundation was unavailable for comment on the Unixsale. But it has criticized ATandamp;T's plan to sell part of Unixto outsiders, saying ATandamp;T would retain most of the controlanyway.   ATandamp;T's control of six seats on Unix System Laboratories'nine-member board would seem to support that criticism. ButATandamp;T has countered that the Unix company's bylaws willrequire a supermajority of votes by its board -- seven ormore -- to effect major changes in the company.</TEXT></DOC>
