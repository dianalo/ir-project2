Trump is selling the St.Moritz Hotel in Manhattan to Australian billionaire entrepreneurAlan Bond, winner of the 1983 America's Cup and the world'sfourth-largest brewer.   Trump and a Bond representative said Monday that the sellingprice was $180 million. Trump said he bought the hotel, which sitsnear Central Park, for $31 million in 1985.   Trump said the St. Moritz has made an average yearly profit of$12.5 million during his ownership.   Sale of the 775-room elegant hotel comes on the heels of Trump'sagreement last week to buy the Eastern Air Shuttle for $365 million.   But the developer said in today's New York Times that he was notselling property to raise cash to buy the shuttle.   ``I don't want to have two hotels on the same block,'' heexplained. He bought the Plaza Hotel down the street from the St.Moritz earlier this year.   Bond representatives said the Australian's company wouldcontinue to operate the St. Moritz, which dates back to 1931, as ahotel.   His diversified multinational company, Bond CorporationHoldings, controls half of the Australian beer market and owns thePittsburgh Brewing Co. and G. Heileman in the United States. Bondalso is acquiring a mining company and already has hotels inAustralia and Great Britain.   Trump, whose net worth was estimated by Forbes magazine lastweek at $1 billion, did not own the land the St. Moritz occupies.The hotel, which includes the well-known attractions of Cafe de laPaix and Rumpelmayer's soda fountain, has a 230-year lease on theground.</TEXT></DOC>
