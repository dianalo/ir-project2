North, giving up a struggle with the Reagan administrationover disclosure of some of the nation's best-kept secrets.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh moved to dismiss conspiracyand theft charges, citing North's ``insistence on introducingclassified information in his defense'' and the Reaganadministration's refusal to release material the judge ruled Northwould need at trial.   North is still confronted with 12 felony charges that carryprison terms totaling as much as 60 years.   These include obstructing various congressional and presidentialinquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by preparing false statementsand destroying documents.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell scheduled a hearing forMonday to consider Walsh's request, but the judge is expected todismiss the charges.   President Reagan, returning to the White House from a Californiavacation, said of Walsh's motion, ``It satisfies our problem, whichhas been ... concern about national security ... but of course thejudge has not responded yet. We're waiting to see what the future isgoing to be.''   Asked whether he was going to pardon North, Reagan said, ``We'rewaiting for the judicial process to go forward.''   The president has repeatedly said he has no plans to pardon hisformer aide. But the head of the liberal group People for theAmerican Way criticized the administration's stance on theclassified documents and said Walsh's ``efforts appear to have beensandbagged.''   The group's president, Arthur Kropp, said ``the Reaganadministration appears determined to give Ollie North a `pocket'pardon as a reward for his Iran-Contra activities.''   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh denied such contentions, tellingreporters outside the Justice Department, ``On the contrary, theassurance that was given to me by Judge Walsh was that he had beendealt with in good faith, that every line of inquiry that he pursuedhe received the fullest cooperation from the executive branch.''   Walsh had informed Thornburgh of his decision to seek dismissalat a meeting Wednesday.   Reagan and Vice President Bush have been subpoenaed by North totestify at the trial, but dropping the two major charges could makeit harder to show why their testimony would be needed, perhapsdefusing a legal issue that has threatened to delay the trial nowscheduled to begin Jan. 31.   However, defense attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., said in anangrily worded statement that he would continue to seek to useclassified documents to defend the remaining charges against North.   ``Although the heart of its case is destroyed, the independentcounsel continues to toy with Colonel North and apparently refusesto recognize that classified information pervades the remainingcharges as well,'' Sullivan said.   In his motion, Walsh said the conspiracy and theft charges thatNorth and three co-defendants illegally diverted more than $14million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebelsposed ``the most difficult classified information problems'' in thecase.   ``These counts allege broad-reaching activities... that includeNorth's interaction with a number of intelligence agencies and touchupon a number of highly classified covert programs,'' Walsh said ina brief motion filed with Gesell.   ``Efforts to simplify the charges have not eliminated the riskthat a quantity of classified national security information would becompromised by a public trial'' on the two charges, Walsh said.   Among other allegations, the retired Marine lieutenant coloneland former National Security Council aide is still charged withillegally using a tax-exempt foundation to help finance theNicaraguan rebels known as Contras, making personal use of at least$4,300 in travelers checks he received from the anti-Sandinistamovement and accepting an illegal gift in the form of a $14,000security fence at his suburban Virginia home.   But if Gesell grants Thursday's dismissal motion, North would nolonger be accused of illegally diverting arms-for-hostage proceedsto secretly finance the Contras at a time Congress had banned suchaid.   Walsh's move also suggests that the two major charges could alsobe dismissed later against North's co-defendants, former NationalSecurity Adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakimand retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord.   That would depend, however, on how much classified informationmight be deemed necessary for their defense efforts. Poindexter'saccess to secret documents when he worked at the White House wouldprobably put him in the best position of the three to gain dismissalon such grounds.   Walsh's motion was triggered by Gesell's refusal to allow morecensoring of 300 prosecution exhibits to meet administrationconcerns about disclosing in court sensitive information aboutcovert intelligence operations.   The prosecutor concluded that the two charges ``cannot be triedin a manner that protects that information.''   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the court ispowerless to order disclosure of secret evidence needed in the case.But the judge can dismiss certain criminal charges if the governmentrefuses to make the classified information available for use at apublic trial.   Gesell had said that if the prosecution were to follow through onplans to use exhibits covering some 3,000 pages of documents, it hadto include verbatim quotations from intelligence reports andreferences to foreign officials by their general importance andfunction. The judge also insisted on including references to CIAofficials, sources and propriety companies.   North had initially sought to disclose several thousandgovernment documents, covering extremely sensitive informationincluding efforts to locate U.S. hostages in the Middle East.   In a tartly worded opinion issued last month, Gesell accused thedefense of trying to force disclosure of irrelevant but sensitiveinformation to scuttle the case.</TEXT></DOC>
