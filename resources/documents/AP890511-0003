The ethics panel also denied a motion by the speaker's lawyersto bar the special outside counsel in the case, Chicago lawyerRichard Phelan, from holding private discussions with thecommittee, but granted other motions seeking access to witnessesand documents, said Stephen D. Susman, a lawyer for Wright.   Committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., strongly defendedPhelan against allegations from Wright's camp that he has usedfaulty and weak reasoning in bringing charges against the speaker.   ``That is totally inaccurate, totally wrong and an exercise inbad judgment by the respondent's attorneys,'' Dixon told reporters.   At the same time, the Justice Department said it would undertakean independent review of Wright's business and political dealingsif the House exonerates the speaker.   ``I expect the department will take an independent look,'' DavidRunkel, chief spokesman for Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, saidin response to a question at a press briefing.   He said such a review would cover matters brought up by theHouse ethics committee and ``other matters that have been raised,''such as Wright's involvement in a 1985 political fund-raisingeffort in Texas.   ``We are going to keep an eye on allegations made about theconduct of the speaker,'' Runkel said. But the spokesman added that``it's premature to say we are going to have any investigation.''   Asked if the department would investigate Wright if the Housedisciplined the speaker, Runkel said: ``The Justice Department hasa different function than the House has and we are keeping tabs onthat. It would be premature to say what that's going to lead to.''   In seeking to dismiss the most serious allegations against thespeaker _ that he used bulk sales of his book to evade limits onoutside earned income and improperly accepted $145,000 in giftsfrom a person with a direct interest in legislation _ the lawyerscharged the ethics committee is trying to hold Wright to a new,tougher standard.   The charges amount to ``a house of cards delicately balanced ona series of unprecedented reinterpretations of House rules,'' theyargued.   The eight-lawyer defense team did not immediately challengeother charges that the speaker failed to report as gifts benefitshe received from Fort Worth, Texas, developer George Mallick, butsignaled that that issue would be contested later.   On the matter of Wright's gas investment, Dixon said thecommittee, after a briefing on a series of interviews conductedlast week, decided that ``there were other witnesses who would haveto be interviewed'' and directed Phelan to continue investigating.   The investment involves a gas well in Sabine Lake, near theTexas-Louisiana line, which Wright and Mallick bought into for$9,120 last January. They sold their interest less than five monthslater for a $340,000 profit, even though the well's production haddwindled.   The ethics panel also generally discussed a series of otherallegations against Wright raised in recent news stories, but madeno decisions on whether to formally expand the investigation toinclude those, Dixon said.   The New York Times, in its Thursday editions, reported thatamong the transactions that have come under scrutiny is Wright's$100,000 investment in a Texas nursing home company that later wentbankrupt.   Published reports have said Wright was one of the few investorsin Jewell Enterprises to receive payments from the company beforeit failed.   The company's president, T.R. Jewell, is quoted in Thursday'seditions of The Times as saying his company provided Wright themoney to pay interest on the $100,000 bank loan Wright used to buyhis stock in 1983. Jewell said he considered the money a ``loan''and that similar loans were available to a few other stockholders.   Jewell told the Fort Worth, Texas, Star-Telegram, that Wright'sinvestment had no connection with any legislation before Congressand that the company gained nothing by having the powerfulcongressman as one of its 28 investors.   ``We were regulated by the state; there isn't anything he couldhave done to help us,'' Jewell told the Star-Telegram.   Among the areas the panel is looking into is a 1985 fund-raisingeffort for a special congressional election in Texas in whichWright took an intense personal interest. In testimony last week ata federal fraud trial in Dallas, Wright was linked to a politicalaction committee which collected allegedly illegal contributionsfrom officials of Commodore Savings and Loan, an insolvent Texasthrift.   On Wednesday, three former Commodore employees testified theygave money to the East Texas First PAC and later were reimbursed bytheir company, either through pay increases or checks for fictionaltravel.   Former Commodore President E. Morten Hopkins, his brother Robertand John W. Harrell, former Commodore CEO and vice chairman of theboard, are being tried on charges they misused Commodore funds tomake illegal PAC contributions.   East Texas First raised and spent about $100,000 to help Rep.Jim Chapman, D-Texas, win a special election in 1985. A formerCommodore chief financial officer testified Friday that his bosstold him Wright had agreed to halt legislation opposed by thesavings and loan industry if the industry raised $250,000 for thePAC, but Wright denied making any such statement.</TEXT></DOC>
