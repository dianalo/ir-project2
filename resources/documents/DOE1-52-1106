<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-52-1106 </DOCNO><TEXT>The kinetics of the non-catalytic thermal hydrocracking of Athabasca asphalteneswere studied over the temperature range 350-425 degrees C in a batchautoclave reactor. Gas, resins, oils (saturates + aromatics), coke andunreacted asphaltenes were separated. Product concentrations were determinedas a function of reaction time for the above pseudoproducts. Two simplereaction models are proposed. In the first, the asphaltene fraction isconsidered to be a single reactant and the hydrocracking reaction a singleirreversible reaction. The activation energy for asphaltene consumptionwas found to be 161 kJ mol{sup -1}. In the second, more complex model,four pseudoproducts are used (asphaltenes, maltenes (oils + resins),coke and gas). Activation energies for the reactions were found to bein the range 8-200 kJ mol{sup -} {sup 1}. Asphaltene hydrocracking reactionswere found to have first-order kinetics. Experimental and calculatedproduct distributions were in good agreement. 38 refs., 13 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
