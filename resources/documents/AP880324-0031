AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   According to Martin Blades, a poorfish and fries vendor, a crisis is gripping his country because``the people who have the money, inside and outside the government,are fighting for it.''   He says he doesn't much care how this fight is resolved, as longas the combatants let him and his neighbors ``live in peace withenough to eat.''   As he spoke, Blades held his 17-month-old daughter in his lapoutside the dilapidated wood and tin structure his family shareswith several others in the Chorillo section of Old Panama City.   Neighborhoods like Chorillo have been relatively immune from theviolence borne of the campaign to oust military ruler Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega.   The opposition is led by a coalition of about 200 business,professional, labor, student and other groups. And most of thedisturbances have occurred in middle- and upper-class neighborhoods.   Noriega, who comes from a poor family, has tried to exploitclass and race differences in resisting the pressure to resign. Heand his government portray the opposition drive as an attack on thepoor and black by the rich and white.   Blades is quite aware of the argument.   ``I think this whole thing is a class struggle,'' he said.``There were those who always had the economic power. They are outand want to get back in, and they are trying to get the people toturn against the government.''   Blades was born in Chorillo and has lived most of his life inthis collection of ramshackle buildings adjacent the headquartersof the Defense Forces that Noreiga commands.   The neighborhood was condemned as unsafe and taken over by thegovernment more than 20 years ago. Thousands of people live there,rent free.   ``We just have to maintain them,'' Blades, 34, said of thedilapidated structures.   Blades, who makes a few dollars selling fish and fries outsidehis home, once served in the Defense Forces. He still feels certainsolidarity with the institution, which he says has providedstability.   ``The people from the Defense Forces sometimes bring us lumberand other things we need to repair the buildings,' he said.   Like others in his neighborhood, Blades described himself asapolitical, but discusses politics with ease.   ``We all believe in democracy here. We are poor, but we are borndemocrats because we do not have much,'' he said.   ``Those who are born with much, I do not think they can feel theway we do about all being equal.''   Many of Chorillo's residents do manual labor or odd jobs or workas taxi drivers. Many are unemployed.   ``A change would not affect us much. I personally cannot say Ihave lost all faith in politicians, but I do not trust them much,''Blades said.   Around the corner, Carlos Rivas rushed up a flight of stairscarrying a large dish of rice and chicken from the soup kitchen atOur Lady of Fatima Church. He and his pregnant wife watched astheir children ate.   Rivas said he is a construction worker who has been out of worksince late November, shortly after the political crisis began toaffect the economy.   ``I have always worked,'' he said. ``I am a painter also. I'lldo any kind of job.''   The family lives in a single room with a stove that doesn't workand a tiny altar. Rivas gets by by peddling canned food provided byhis father-in-law.   But business is bad. Banks have been closed for week, thegovernment has not paid its employees and an opposition-calledgeneral strike has virtually shut down Panama's economy.   ``I am an honest man, but when I see them hungry, there aretimes when I feel like going out and doing something desperate,''Rivas said as his children ate. ``But my wife tells me to bepatient. There has to be a solution. If Noriega has to go, then heshould go.''</TEXT></DOC>
