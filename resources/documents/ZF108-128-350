Navy.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Navy Creates ADP/Telcom DivisionandM;The Navy last week merged its communications and ADP systems under onecommand as part of the reforms mandated by the Defense Management Report.andM;The new division, the Naval Communications/Information Systems Division, setsinformation resources management policy.andP;  Rear Adm.andP;  Paul Tobin, the formerNavy IRM director, is heading it.andM;Nina C. Cornett, associate Navy IRM director, is acting as Navy IRM director.andM;The division includes a new Naval Computer and Telecommunications Command.andO;The command encompasses the naval communications stations, the Naval DataAutomation Command and the Navy Regional Data Automation Center.andM;The report issued by Defense Secretary Richard Cheney directed the militaryservices to streamline acquisition management.andP;  Known almost immediately asthe DMR, it also instructed DOD officials to develop joint corporateinformation management (CIM) systems for the three services.andM;Adm.andP;  Carlisle A.H.andP;  Trost, chief of naval operations, responded byrecommending that the Navy create a new communications and informationsystems division that will encompass several other once-separateorganizations.andM;&quot;This is happening in response to the DMR, which got us looking at areas forpossible consolidation,&quot; said the Navy IRM official, who would talk only oncondition of anonymity.andM;&quot;I would think if we merge the disciplines, we'll get better efficiency.andP;  Ifyou get both disciplines married up, each can see what the other's doing sowe don't spin our wheels on duplicative efforts,&quot; he said.andM;Work on the consolidated information systems began last fall when DeputyDefense Secretary Donald Atwood called on the services to eliminate duplicatesystems.andP;  The DMR targeted systems concerned with civilian payroll andpersonnel, financial management, warehousing, supply management andcontractor payment.andM;Since then the three services have been informing two CIM working groups inthe Pentagon of their particular requirements.andP;  The groups will try todevelop new, integrated functional descriptions, sources said.andM;Bob Dornan, a GCN columnist and vice president of Federal Sources Inc., aVienna, Va., consulting firm, said DOD's commitment to single informationsystems could not be measured until funding for the CIM is established.andM;An Army official said Atwood's October memo was accompanied by attempts toreduce each service's budget quickly so that the CIM effort could be funded.andO;However, when the DMR appeared last month, several officials said they didnot understand exactly how DOD will pay for the CIM program.andM;&quot;The CIM initiative has all three services throttling their [ADP] systemsback,&quot; the Navy official said.andM;Last year the Air Force combined four computer and communications acquisitioncenters into a single Computer Systems Division.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
