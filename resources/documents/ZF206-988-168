 The CAT scan of the troubled area supports herdiagnosis.andP;  But operating on the eye will be difficult unless the surgeon canpinpoint the tumor's location.andP;  And the CAT scan--a two-dimensional,X-ray-like image shot from a single angel--doesn't show that.andM;She pins up the CAT scan next to the monitor of her PC-based workstation andcalls onto the screen a three-dimensional, exquisitely detailed graphic of anormal eye.andP;  By comparing the two images, she begins to see where the naturalcontours of the diseased eye have been distorted.andP;  She rotates the image ofthe healthy eye to view it from another angle and commands the computer topeel away the tissue surrounding the optic nerve, just as she will have to doin actual surgery.andM;Though the scenario is fictitious, a video library that would store such a3-D image is currently under development at the University of Washington inSeattle.andP;  A similar, though less ambitious, undertaking is nearing completionat Stanford University.andP;  Both projects seek to transfer the details of humananatomy to a more accessible and useful PC-based medium that many in thefield are calling &quot;the electronic cadaver.&quot;andM;The Digital ScalpelandM;Anatomy makes up the core of any basic medical education.andP;  By dissecting ahuman cadaver, students learn the parts and functions of the body.andP;  Butdissection has several limitations.andP;  The embalming fluid used in cadavers,for example, distorts tissue, resulting in less-than-perfect models.andP;  Inaddition, tiny structures such as nerve fibers can't be viewed.andP;  Cadavers areoften hard to come by in the United States, and in some Third World countriestheir dissection violates cultural mores.andP;  Perhaps most frustrating, however,is that medical students generally get to dissect only one cadaver in theircareers because other subjects increasingly compete for their time.andP;  Also,with dissection, you can't go backward: once a cut has been made, the tissueis ruined.andM;The &quot;electronic cadaver&quot; under development at the University of Washington isdesigned to augment traditional classroom instruction.andP;  Essentially adatabase of 3-D images, it seeks to model the human body, enabling users toview anatomical structures from virtually any angle.andP;  It will also allowstudents to perform a kind of digital dissection, in which they can peerthrough layers of tissue to underlying structures for both a macroscopic anda microscopic view.andP;  &quot;Students can assemble, disassemble, and manipulateevery part of the human anatomy again and again, until they learn it,&quot;explains Dr.andP;  Cornelius Rosse, who heads the project.andM;The graphics in the database come from an actual cadaver, which is frozen toprevent distortion and then sectioned.andP;  CAT scans, magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), and photography are among the ways that images of cadaver parts can becaptured.andP;  Those images are then contoured and digitized--traced by hand on adigitizing tablet--into 3-D, x-y-z coordinates.andM;These digitized images are temporarily stored in what Dr.andP;  John Prothero, whooriginated the project and coordinates its computer graphics, calls &quot;ananatomist's workstation.&quot;andP;  In fact, it is an IBM PC AT with a DSI-785Definicon high-resolution graphics card.andP;  There, the images can be edited atwill.andP;  They are then sent to an IRIS graphics workstation, which was chosenin part because it can rotate x-y-z coordinates in space with breathtakingspeed.andP;  The program's developers are also looking to acquire or build asuperminicomputer for this purpose.andM;&quot;The resolution we've achieved to far is extraordinary,&quot; Prothero says.andP;  Butthe digitizing is extremely slow and laborious.andP;  The project is still yearsaway from completion, though images of the brain, the wrist, and the orbit(eye) are ready now.andP;  Prothero's son Jeff, who is developing software for theelectronic cadaver, is looking for artificial intelligence systems toautomate digitization.andP;  &quot;The systems out there right now aren't verypromising,&quot; he says.andM;Cadavers That TeachandM;Artificial intelligence will also play a role in the use of the electroniccadaver.andP;  Ultimately, the project's developers plan to install a front-endexpert system as a tutorial.andP;  Since anatomy encompasses not justtaxonomy--the names of the body parts--but concepts of how those parts worktogether, the system will interact with students and help them with problems.andM;&quot;Some people believe medical students could learn 80 percent of anatomy onthese systems,&quot; contends John Prothero.andP;  He believes the system also willhave wide-ranging applications for researchers and practicing physicians.andO;For example, for years Prothero has been studying the organization of musclecells in the mammalian heart.andP;  &quot;The capabilities of this system would beinvaluable in that work,&quot; he explains.andM;Indeed, medical researchers rely heavily upon anatomy atlases, which are mapsof the human body.andP;  Such atlases emerged in the fifteenth century fromanatomists (among them Leonardo da Vinci), many of whom robbed graves fortheir subjects.andP;  &quot;Those maps haven't changed much,&quot; notes Rosse.andP;  Because theatlases are a two-dimensional, static medium, they have limited use.andP;  Theelectronic cadaver would allow researchers to do more preliminary work beforeincurring the time and costs of actual dissection.andM;Practitioners could also benefit.andP;  John Prothero believes the electroniccadaver could be immensely useful in planning surgery.andP;  It could also advancemedical diagnostic systems, AI-based programs that identify diseases.andP;  Sincethe images of the electronic cadaver represent &quot;normative data,&quot; expertsystems could compare abnormal data against them to yield a diagnosis.andM;Doctor/patient relations, an area of growing controversy within theprofession, stand to benefit as well.andP;  Physicians, for example, could showpatients exactly what is entailed in a particular kind of surgery.andM;But education will be helped first.andP;  John Prothero believes it will be a boonnot only to medical schools, but to high school and undergraduate biologycourses as well.andP;  Dr.andP;  Robert Chase, cofounder of a similar project atStanford University, agrees.andM;Bit-Mapping the BodyandM;The Stanford system, called The Electric Cadaver, is slated for classroomtesting within three months.andP;  Unlike the University of Washington project,which tries to model the human body, the Stanford system is basically anelectronic anatomy atlas.andP;  The system operates on a Macintosh andincorporates more than 5,000 images stored on a videodisc.andP;  &quot;What we'rebuilding is an electronic book,&quot; explains Dr.andP;  Steven Freedman, who cofoundedthe project with Chase.andP;  &quot;One of the things we're trying to figure out iswhat a dynamic [interactive] book is: What does one look like?andP;  How do youinteract with it?andP;  What features does it have?&quot;andM;The system uses two screens, a television and the computer's monitor.andP;  Thevideodisc player is connected both to the television and to the Macintosh.andO;When the user calls up an image of a skull, it appears as a photograph on thetelevision and as a bit-mapped reproduction on the Mac.andP;  &quot;What you see is amap of the photograph,&quot; says Freedman.andP;  &quot;You command the computer to turn theskull, and the side of the skull appears on both the video and the monitor.andO;Ultimately we want both of these to show up on one screen.&quot;andM;Freedman believes that using dual images offers a distinct advantage.andP;  &quot;Thismedium is about representing something from multiple points of view,&quot; saysFreedman.andP;  &quot;The bit-mapped image is an abstraction of the video picture.andP;  Itsvalue is in abstracting the important features of what you want to see.andP;  It'ssimilar to car manuals that show a drawing of the engine next to a photographof it.andP;  The drawing lets you see features that may not be apparent in thephotograph.&quot;andM;Chase agrees.andP;  &quot;Physicians often need a new view of anatomy in order tounderstand what it is they're seeing in, say, cross sections of a magneticresonance scan,&quot; he explains.andM;Freedman wrote the software for The Electric Cadaver in a hypertext system hedesigned.andP;  It was later transferred to HyperTalk.andM;The technologies selected make The Electric Cadaver highly malleable.andP;  Thetext can be edited and annotated to fit any range of expertise.andP;  &quot;The thingabout the system,&quot; Chase explains, &quot;is that it may be adapted to any level oflearning, whether it's high school, college, graduate education in residencyprograms, or continuing education for specialized medicine.&quot;andP;  And theproject's founders don't intend to limit it to the classroom.andP;  &quot;While it iscurrently mostly an educational tool, that does not constrain our thinking.andO;We expect it to become part of a physician's workstation,&quot; Chase asserts.andM;Stanford's Electric Cadaver will be tested at several medical schools beforeit becomes more widely available.andP;  While its developers would like to expandthe system's library of images, they recognize an impatience on the part ofthe medical community.andM;Confronted with a virtual flood of medical discovery in microbiology,pharmacology, and related fields, medical schools have had students spendless time in dissection and more in other areas.andP;  Because of this, &quot;they'redesperate for more efficient ways of teaching anatomy,&quot; Chase contends.andP;  &quot;TheElectric Cadaver won't replace the real one.andP;  But it will make learninganatomy more useful, more effective, and more interesting.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
