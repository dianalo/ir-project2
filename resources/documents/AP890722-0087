About 50 people, half of them children, were at the Mount OliveChurch of God in Christ, which has been active in fighting drugs inthe gang-plagued neighborhood south of downtown.   Police said they had no immediate explanation for the shootings.   The killer, who may have had an accomplice, was at large today,said Lt.

Another witness, who spoke to The Associated Press by phone frominside the church said the congregation was listening to thepreacher when they heard two shots fired outside the church.   A few minutes later, a man in a ski mask with a shotgun calmlyentered and shot three times.   ``I was the first to face the barrel,'' said the woman, whorefused to give her name. ``I prayed, `Don't let him shoot me.' Isat very still and he walked on.''   A woman in her 30s was shot point-blank in the face. The othervictim was an elderly woman, shot as she tried to flee, said Ms.Wright.   ``One lady turned to run to the bathroom and he shot her in theback,'' she said, citing the witness.
