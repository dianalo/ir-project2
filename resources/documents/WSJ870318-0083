Twenty-eight Japanese banks, including some of the nation's largest, will establish the company in the Cayman Islands by March 31, when Japan's fiscal year ends. The new company is expected to be called JBA Investors Inc.    &quot;Basically, it is a garbage can. And all the banks want to stuff their loans,&quot; said one Japanese banker, who asked not to be identified.    The banks will initially sell at a discount about $6 billion of Mexican loans to the new company, banking sources said. Then the company will either pool the loans and try to resell them to investors or hold them to maturity.    At first, the banks will be allowed to sell only their Mexican loans to the company. And the amount will be limited to no more than 70% of one loan. Later, bankers expect to be able to sell other sovereign loans. Some bankers suggest that loans to Brazil will be next.    As preferred shareholders, the banks will receive dividends if a borrower makes interest or principal payments. If not, the new company will incur the losses, not the parent banks. Participating banks, including Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Bank Ltd., Bank of Tokyo Ltd. and Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., will also pay $3,000 each for common equity shares, creating an up-front capital base of $84,000 for the company.    U.S. banks aren't likely to imitate the Japanese action. Several U.S. bankers said they aren't yet clear on how the plan would work, or how much of the Japanese banks' loans the new company would receive. Some doubt such a plan would be workable under U.S. regulations. Japanese bankers in the U.S. have played down the new concern, calling it a shell company that will have a relatively small capital base and be operated just by an administrative staff.    Bank of Tokyo's chairman, Yasuke Kashiwagi, characterized the plan as a modest way to compensate for Japan's tax laws. Japanese banks are allowed to set aside only 5% of a loan outstanding in loan-loss reserves, and only 1% of the loan is tax deductible. But that's better than in the U.S., where -- following the new tax law -- banks can get tax deductions for their loan-loss reserves only when they can actually justify or document a loss, New York accountants say.    Regulations vary for European banks, although they are usually more generous. In Britain only specific loan-loss reserves are generally tax deductible. In Switzerland and West Germany, tax authorities have allowed banks tax-deductible loan-loss reserves for a large percentage of their Third World debt, sometimes ranging as high as 20% or 30%.    Japanese bankers said the new company should improve their balance sheets by allowing them to claim tax deductions on the losses that stem from selling the loans at a discount.    While the new company will be established just a few weeks after Brazil suspended interest payments on about $67 billion of its foreign debt, Japanese bank officials said they have been discussing the project for months.    Although the Finance Ministry isn't supporting the new company financially, ministry officials have offered &quot;guidance&quot; on tax rules and procedure. &quot;If it helps Japanese banks deal with the debt problem, then we aren't opposed to the plan,&quot; said one Finance Ministry official.    Japanese banks have the second-largest Third World debt exposure -- the U.S. has the largest -- and the Finance Ministry estimates that Japanese banks outstanding loans to Latin American countries totaled $30 billion at the end of 1985. Of that total, Mexico accounted for about $13 billion and Brazil for about $10 billion. Bankers and analysts in Tokyo said most of the medium- to long-term commerical bank loans were extended to finance state-owned projects.    Among Japanese banks, Bank of Tokyo has the largest debt exposure in Latin America, mainly because of its role as Japan's leading international and foreign-exchange bank.    In a 1987 report on Japanese banks, the British stockbrokerage James Capel andamp; Co. said the Bank of Tokyo's &quot;exposure to heavily indebted countries may be in excess of one trillion yen ($6.6 billion), or 13% of its total loan portfolio.&quot; Bank of Tokyo officials said the figure is too high, but declined to give their own figure. Unlike U.S. banks, Japanese banks aren't required to disclose loan portfolio figures.    Because of its large loan exposure, Mr. Kashiwagi said the Bank of Tokyo will be one of the main beneficiaries of the new company.    While Japanese bankers are concerned by Brazil's debt moratorium, they don't seem to believe that failure to reach a rescheduling agreement would devastate them. &quot;If all the Third World debt would go bad, no Japanese bank would be technically bankrupted,&quot; said a bank analyst for a major U.S. stockbrokerage here.    Japanese banks have been bailed out by the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar. In just 18 months, the value of Japanese loans to Latin American countries, which generally are denominated in U.S. dollars, has declined more than 50%.    Also, many analysts say Japanese banks are stronger than they appear in terms of capital-asset ratios. Japanese banks reportedly have significant hidden assets, including real estate and stock holdings valued at their purchase price rather than current market value.    Despite this latest move to reduce their debt exposure, Japanese bankers say they aren't withdrawing their support for the international financial system. &quot;We are willing to cooperate with American banks, Brazil and other international financial institutions,&quot; said a senior official at the Bank of Tokyo.    Even so, Japanese bankers said they aren't ready to make additional loans unless debtor nations take concrete steps to stabilize their economies or international insitutions step in and reduce the risk by offering some sort of guarantee. Mr. Kashiwagi said that without international coordination and cooperation, there is a limit to what Japanese banks can do. </TEXT></DOC>
