The two nations will work together on a project to measure theeffects of solar radiation on the earth's magnetic field, seniorU.S. officials said on condition of anonymity.   Japan will provide a satellite and scientific instruments, andthe United States will provide equipment and launch the satellitein 1992, according to a joint statement issued by Quayle and Kaifu.   The agreement comes under Quayle's effort to develop a ``globalpartnership'' with Japan.   Quayle will suggest to Kaifu and other Japanese leaders thattheir two nations work together on a wide range of issues,including space, drugs, Third World debt and promotion ofdemocracy, one senior administration official said.   Another senior administration official said both nations wouldbenefit from space cooperation, despite the potential for futurecommercial competition in the area.   ``The United States is committed to cooperative internationalrelations in space,'' the official said.   Space is one area in which Japan still lags far behind theUnited States and Europe. In 1989, Japan will spend $1.1 billion onits space programs, compared with $9 billion spent by the U.S.National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1988.   The Japanese government has, however, targeted the area for highpriority development.   In June, Japan's Science and Technology Agency announced itplanned to develop an unmanned space plane in the next decade andeventually send its own astronauts into space aboard Japanese-madespacecraft.   It said the projects fall under a 10-year space program thatalso calls for basic research on robots capable of assembling andrepairing earth-orbiting satellites and for developing a rocketable to launch commercial satellite payloads.   Japan's National Aerospace Laboratory already is participatingin a 12-nation space station program initiated by the United Statesthat begins in 1996.   For that project, Japan is developing a manned space platformwith artificial pressure and gravity to provide an environment thatwould minimize physical risks.   Quayle, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday from South Korea, is inJapan on the second leg of a tour through Asia. On Tuesday, heleaves for the Philippines. He also is to visit Malaysia beforereturning to Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
