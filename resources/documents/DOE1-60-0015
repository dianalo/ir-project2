This issue of BET featuresthe program overview for DOE's Office of Buildings and Community Systems.Each successive issue of BET also highlights a current energy-conservativenew technology project being conducted for DOE's Office of Buildingsand Community Systems. This publication contains the abstracts of DOEreports, journal articles, conference papers, patents, theses, and monographsadded to the Energy Data Base (EDB) during the past month. Also includedare US information obtained through acquisition programs or interagencyagreements and international information obtained through the InternationalEnergy Agency's Energy Technology Data Exchange or government-to-governmentagreements. The digests in BET and other citations to information onenergy conservation back to 1974 are available for on-line searchingand retrieval on EDB. Current information, added daily to EDB, is availableto DOE and its contractors through the DOE Integrated Technical InformationSystem. Customized profiles can be developed to provide current informationto meet each user's needs. The entire Energy Data Base is available oncommercial on-line retrieval systems.</TEXT></DOC>
