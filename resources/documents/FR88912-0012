Small and Mrs. Raymond Robins in the spring of 1924and was named <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> by Small (1926), who later transferred theplant to his new genus <T3>Rotantha</T3> (Small 1933). Later, Shetler (1963) returned the plantto <T3>Campanula</T3> while noting that it was possibly a Eurasian speciesthat had been introduced, perhaps accidentially, to Chinsegut Hill. Fieldwork in the 1980's by Nancy Morin, Steven Leonard, Stanwyn Shetler, andothers showed that the plant is not restricted to moist areas on ChinsegutHill, but is primarily found on moist ground at the edges of two pondsnear the hill. Now that the bellflower's habitat is better known, it hasbecome apparent that the plant is a native, narrowly endemic species (Wunderlinpersonal communication 1985).<T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> is an annual herb with a slender taproot andslender, angled stems 1-15 centimeters (0.43-6.0 inches) tall. The largestleaves are at the base of the plant, ovate to elliptic, and 6-12 millimeters(.24-.47 inch) long. Leaves farther up the stem are narrower and shorter.The flowers are solitary with the sepals 1.0-2.5 millimeters (.04-.10 inch)long and the pale blue bell-shaped corolla 7-8 millimeters (.28-.31 inch)wide. Flowering is in March and April. The only other bellflower in Floridais <T3>Campanula floridana,</T3> a widespread species with shorter sepalsand a longer corolla (Perkins 1979, Wunderlin <T3>et al.</T3> 1980a, Wunderlin 1982). <T3>Campanula robinsiae </T3>is one of a number of low plants that occupythe edges of ponds; its abundance apparently fluctuates considerably fromyear to year depending on water levels. The ponds are adjacent to pasturesgrazed by cattle.Cooley's water-willow is a member of the acanthus family (Acanthaceae).Specimens were collected in 1924 and 1934 by John K. Small and colleagues,and in 1957 by George Cooley. Monachino and Leonard (1959) recognized thesespecimens as a new species, <T3>Justicia cooleyi,</T3> distinct from the two other native water-willowsin central Florida. Meagher (1974) confirmed this view. <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> is a rhizomatous perennial herb with upright,quadrangular stems and usually less than 40 centimeters (16 inches) tall.The leaves are up to 5 centimeters (2 inches) long. The flowers are borneon forked, zigzag branches slightly longer than the leaves. The petalsare fused into a two-lipped corolla with the lower lip slightly longer,7-8 millimeters (.28-.31 inch) long. The lower lip is mottled lavenderand white. The rest of the corolla is bright lavender-rose. Flowering occursfrom August to December. A capsule 1.2 centimeters (.47 inch) long developsfrom the flower (Kral 1983, Perkins 1979).The first collection of this water-willow was made in a ``low hammock''or hardwood forest near Mascotte in Lake County. All subsequent collectionshave been from north central Hernando County on sand to clay soils thatrange from moist to seasonally wet. Some sites are on low rises in wethammocks or swamps; most are on uplands or hills with trees such as southernmagnolia, black gum, sweet gum, live oak, laurel oak, pignut hickory, cabbagepalm, flowering dogwood, and yaupon holly. The understory may contain manyferns, woodland grasses, and sedges.The extensive outcrops of limestone rock and the sinkholes in the HernandoCounty forests are unusual in the Florida peninsula and provide excellenthabitat for ferns, including the tropical hammock fern (<T3>Blechnum occidentale</T3>), and the draft spleenwort (<T3>Asplenium pumilum</T3>), both considered endangered by the State. Theterrestrial nodding-cap orchids <T3>Triphora latifolia </T3>and <T3>Triphora craigheadii </T3>are both endemic to hardwood forests in thispart of Florida. Both are listed as threatened by the State and are candidatesfor Federal listing. Florida crabgrass (<T3>Digitaria floridana</T3>), a non-weedy endemic species that is a candidatefor Federal listing, also occurs in these forests (data from Florida NaturalAreas Inventory, September 1987).Portions of the hardwood forests have been cleared for pastures. Selectivecutting of trees for timber or to improve grazing for livestock probablydoes not adversely affect <T3>Justicia cooleyi, </T3>which is known to occur on a periodically mowedhighway right-of-way (Kral 1983, file reports from The Nature Conservancyand the Florida Natural Areas Inventory, Wunderlin <T3>et al. </T3>1980b).The presently known localities for both <T3>Campanula robinsiae </T3>and <T3>Justicia cooleyi </T3>are all on part of the Brooksville Ridge, a regionwith ``the most irregular surface to be found in any area of comparablesize in peninsular Florida'' (White 1970). The region has few surface streams,most drainage being to ponds and prairies in depressions and into sinkholes.Phosphate mining occurred in the area in the past; today, large limestonequarries produce both soft and hard rock, and cattle pasturing is widespread.Also residential development is increasing in the area.Section 12 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 directed the Secretaryof the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants consideredto be endangered, threatened, or extinct. This report, designated as HouseDocument No. 94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. On July1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(40 FR 27823) that accepted the report as a petitionin the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3)) of the Act, asamended. On June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>(41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700vascular plant species recommended by the Smithsonian Report to be endangeredspecies pursuant to section 4 of the Act. <T3>Campanula robinsiae </T3>and <T3>Justicia cooleyi </T3>were included in the Smithsonian Report; theJuly 1, 1975, notice; and the June 6, 1976, proposal.The 1978 Endangered Species Act Amendments required that all proposalsover 2 years old be withdrawn, except that a 1-year grace period was givento proposal already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Servicepublished a notice of withdrawal of the June 6, 1976, proposal, along withfour other proposals which had expired (44 FR 70796).On December 15, 1980, the Service published a notice of review for plants(45 FR 82479), which included <T3>Campanula robinsiae </T3>as a category-1 candidate (a species for whichdata in the Service's possession indicate listing is appropriate). <T3>Justicia cooleyi </T3>was included as a category-2 candidate (a speciesfor which data in the Service's possession indicate listing is possiblyappropriate, but for which additional biological information is neededto support a proposed rule). A supplement to the 1980 notice of reviewpublished on November 28, 1983 (48 FR 53640) treated <T3>Campanula robinsiae </T3>as a category-2 candidate, based on uncertaintyabout the taxonomic status of the plant (Shelter 1963, Wunderlin <T3>et al. </T3>1980a). <T3>Justicia cooleyi </T3>was treated as a category-1 candidate, basedon a status report received from Wunderlin <T3>et al. </T3>(1980b). An updated notice of review published on September27, 1985 (50 Fr 39525), maintained these two plants as candidates in thesame categories: 2-<T3>Campanula robinsiae, </T3>1-<T3>Justica cooleyi. </T3>A letter from Wunderlin (<T3>in litt. </T3>1985), received too late for the updated notice, suggestedthat recent field work on <T3>Campanula robinsiae </T3>had generated ``sufficient information toprepare a proposal for listing the species as endangered.''Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act, as amended in 1982, requires the Secretaryto make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months of theirreceipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 Amendments further requires all petitionspending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submittedon that date. This was the case for <T3>Campanula robinsiae </T3>and <T3>Justicia cooleyi </T3>because the Service had accepted the 1975 Smithsonianreport as a petition. On October 13, 1983, October 12, 1984, October 11,1985, October 10, 1986, and October 9, 1987, the Service found that thepetitioned listing of these species was warranted, and that, although pendingproposals had precluded their proposal, expeditious progress was beingmade to list these species. Publication of the present proposal constitutesthe final 1-year finding that is required on or before October 13, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered orthreatened species due to one or more of the five factors described insection 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> Small (Brooksville bellflower), and for <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> Monachino and Leonard (Cooley's water-willow)are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof their habitats or ranges.</T3> The known localities for <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> and <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> are in north central Hernando County, includingAnnutteliga Hammock near U.S. Highway 98. Some of the original hardwoodforest in this area has been converted to pastures, as shown on topographicmaps. Limestone quarries occupy at least ten square miles. A residentialsubdivision occupies 26 square miles, including part of Annutteliga Hammock.Smaller subdivisions and rural residences are encroaching on other areasof forest. Hernando County was the second fastest-growing county in thenation from 1980 to 1986, growing by 74.8 percent in the period, accordingto a Census Bureau report (<T3>The New York Times,</T3> September 1, 1987). The University of Florida,Bureau of Economic and Business Research confirms that this rapid growthis continuing, with the 1987 population estimated to have increased 79.3percent over 1980, for a total of 79,718 (<T3>Jacksonville Times-Union,</T3> August 26, 1987).<T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> is native to the hardwood forest in HernandoCounty, although two of the seven known sites are in modified forest, oneon a wide highway right-of-way among a group of trees and the other inan unusual seepage area in a cattle pasture on Chinsegut Hill. The smallnumber of known sites, despite searches by capable field botanists (includingSteven Leonard for the Florida Natural Areas Inventory), indicates thatany further loss of suitable habitat would seriously threaten the continuedexistence of the species.<T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> is known to occur only at three sites. Onesite, with few plants is in the seepage area with <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> on Chinsegut Hill. The site has been used asa pasture for many years and no changes in land management are anticipated.The two principal populations are at the margins of two ``prairies'' orponds with seasonally fluctuating water levels. Changes in land use inthe watersheds surrounding the prairies have the potential to affect waterlevels in the ponds by increasing the quantity of runoff; runoff waterfrom developed areas may also be contaminated by petroleum products, fertilizers,and herbicides. Therefore, while there appears to be little danger of destructionof this plant's habitat, adverse modification of the habitat constitutesa serious threat to <T3>Campanula robinsiae.</T3>B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. Justicia cooleyi</T3> is not of interest as an ornamental (RobertMcCartney, pers. comm. 1986), but it occurs at the same site as a rarefern that is vulnerable to collection by fern enthusiasts, so it is inadvisableto publicize the exact localities of the <T3>Justicia.</T3>The Florida National Areas Inventory treats data on <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> as sensitive because the plant is restrictedto only 3 sites and it is vulnerable to overcollecting and vandalism.C. <T3>Diseases or Predation.</T3> Not applicable.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. Justicia cooleyi</T3>and <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> are listed as endangered under the Preservationof Native Flora of Florida Act (Section 581.185-187, Florida Statutes),which regulates taking, transport, and sale of plants but does not providehabitat protection. <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> is protected on the Nature Conservancy's RobinsMemorial Forest Preserve, and this private and public conservation organizationis seeking to conserve both species on private land through its landownercontact program. Listing under the Act will augment private conservationmeasures for these plants.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting their continued existence.</T3>The restricted geographic ranges of these plants, and their specializedhabitats, exacerbate the risks posed by the preceding four factors, makingit very possible that either species could become extinct in the absenceof organized conservation measures.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> and <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> in determining to propose this rule. Based onthis evaluation, the preferred action is to list both species as endangered.Both plants are narrowly endemic to a geographic area where agriculture,mining, and residential development have already altered a large portionof the original vegetation. Because there is no rangewide provision toensure protection of the remaining habitat, both species are in dangerof becoming extinct in all or a significant portion of their ranges. Criticalhabitat is not proposed for either species for the reasons described inthe next section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> or <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3> at this time. Publication of critical habitatdescriptions and maps would increase the degree of threat from tramplingor taking by vandals and curiosity seekers. Pubication of precise localitiesfor <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> is especially undesirable because the plantis restricted to three very small areas that could easily be damaged orruined by trampling or collecting.Designation of critical habitat affects only Federal agencies. The onlyFederal agency which manages land in the habitats of these plants is theU.S. Department of Agriculture (Subtropical Agricultural Research Station).Past management by this agency has not adversely affected the plants. Adequatefuture protection can be assured on the two Federally-owned tracts withoutdetermining critical habitat. All involved parties and land owners willbe notified of the location and importance of protecting this species habitat.Because designation of critical habitat increase the threat of taking orother human activity, and offers no protection not provided by the listingalone, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudentfor <T3>Justicia cooleyi </T3>or <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> at the present time.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destory oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service.Because most sites for the two plants are privately or State owned, theService anticipates few conferences or consultations, unless Federal ownershipor mineral rights is found to extend beneath or near one of the sites andif phosphate mining or limestone quarrying is proposed in such areas. Otherwise,the only Federal land on which they are known to occur at present is managedby the Department of Agriculture whose past practices have been consistentwith the needs of the species.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of section9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions,in part, would make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdictionof the United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreigncommerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for salethis species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduceto possesson the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Certainexceptions can apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permitsto carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered speciesunder certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits wouldever be sought or issued, because neither <T3>Campanula robinsiae</T3> nor <T3>Justicia cooleyi </T3>is raised for horticultural purposes. Requestsfor copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them maybe addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and WildlifeService, P.O. Box 27329, Central Station, Washington, DC 20038-7329 (202/343-4955).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to <T3>Campanula robinsiae </T3>or <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3>;(2) The location of any additional populations of these species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thesespecies; and(4) Current or planned activities in the range and habitats of these speciesand their possible impacts on these species.Final promulgation of the regulation on these species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the FieldSupervisor, Jacksonville Field Office, Fish and Wildlife Service, 3100University Boulevard South, Jacksonville, Florida 32216.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (49 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="74">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Kral, R. 1983. <T3>Justicia cooleyi</T3>.
