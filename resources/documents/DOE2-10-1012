Partial defoliation (33% and 66%) resultedin a higher apparent photosynthetic effectivity for all the remainingleaves on the shoot. The pattern of distribution of photosynthetateswould seem to stay the same between the defoliation treatments. The controlvines were found to carry excess foliage. Optimal photosynthetic activityof all the leaves on the vine was therefore not reached.</TEXT></DOC>
