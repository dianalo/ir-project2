Twoyears ago, CBS plunged deeply into the sports market, committing more than$3.5 billion to televise baseball, football, basketball and the Olympics.Success in the ratings has been spotty; success with advertisers has been outof reach.;   Based on the knowledge of contracts CBS had with major leaguebaseball and football -- $1.06 billion each over four years -- the athletesdemanded a higher share of the windfall being reaped by team owners. Whilegame ticket and concession prices soared at the same time, the public was ledto believe that the real money funding sports was coming from the networks.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SPORTS WORLD'S GOLDEN EGG COULD CRACK UP  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for the Cox News Service.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Of course, the networks got the money to burn by charging exorbitant ratesto the advertisers who, in turn, passed it on to the consumers. Even peoplewho do not watch baseball or football but do like beer are paying for thosecontracts.;   With the huge CBS loss, which it attributes to its sports deals,there is certain to be fallout.;   When CBS' contract comes due with the majorleague organizations in another two years, you can bet the network will becrying the blues and telling the owners of their losses. In turn, the ownerswill be telling their athletes that the big cash cow is ill and that theshower of dollars is being slowed down.;   Additionally, all the networks aresuffering from increased competition. Cable TV and pay-per-view TV have madeinroads. At-home fans are in a position to select the game of their choice,therefore leaving the potential advertiser in a quandary as to which way to goand how much the event is worth.;   Eventually, this will work its way to a.250 hitter who demands $1.5 million a year. If the network money begins todry up, the team owners may turn more to the fans at the park, or to apay-per-view process -- or they may sit down with the sports agents and tellthem that the golden egg they both have fed off for so many years has broken.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  HOWARD KLEINBERG  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911115  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  374  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 15, 199100320165,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
