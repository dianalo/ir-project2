A good stove design should allow the heater torun a majority of the time at a reasonably low-exess air level and fluegas temperature without producing excessive emissions of incomplete combustionproducts. Results on five different stove types show that a fireplaceor non-airtight stove is very inefficient and can have high emissions,while a well-designed and well-constructed airtight stove may have efficienciesas high as 77%. In particular, sidedraft designs and, to a lesser extent,horizontal baffle designs appear to offer potential for higher efficienciesand lower emissions than other stove types. 3 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
