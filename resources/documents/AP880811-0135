Illicit commerce in wildlife tends to increase during the summerand Christmas holiday seasons because customs officials often areoverloaded and the shipments slip past them, Jean-Patrick Le Ductold a news conference.   Le Duc is an enforcement official for the Convention onInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,which aims to prevent international trade from threatening specieswith extinction.   The convention, in force since 1975, has been ratified by 95countries, including the United States, most Latin Americancountries except Mexico, and many Asian, African and Europeannations.   Signatories are supposed to enforce bans on commercial trade inan agreed list of endangered species and to regulate trade inothers that might become endangered.   Endangered species on the list include all apes, the giantpanda, many South American monkeys, the Asian elephant, allrhinoceroses, many birds of prey and parrots, all sea turtles, somecrocodiles and great whales. No permits are issued forinternational trade in these species except under unusualcircumstances.   Le Duc said many people think live animals make good Christmaspresents. In Europe, for example, parrots and reptiles includingbaby crocodiles are increasingly popular pets.   He said total trade, legal and illegal, in wildlife amounts to$5 billion annually. He estimated that illegal trade is about 30percent of the total.   The hotspots of illicit wildlife trade are Southeast Asia,Japan, Latin America and Africa, although ``Africa is doing morethan any other developing country'' to try to control it, Le Ducsaid.   But he said a trader could buy a gray parrot in Ghana for about$10 and resell it for about $600 in North America.   A statement from the convention's headquarters in Lausannelisted 10 examples of illicit trade that have been thwarted in thepast 10 weeks.   In one case, ``a notorious convicted animal trader'' sent crateswith live animals from Equatorial Guinea destined for Honduras viaSpain, it said.   ``At Madrid airport, customs agents stopped the shipment. In thecrates they found five chimpanzees (two dead), 12 crocodiles (threedead) nine Mandrill monkeys (one dead), 11 Agama lizards (ninedead), seven tortoises, 17 Saimiri monkeys (two dead) and 31 grayparrots,'' the statement said. ``The surviving animals were givento the Madrid Zoo.''   In two other cases, 8,000 baby crocodiles were shipped fromColombia to Taiwan, it said. One shipment of 2,000 was discoveredbecause of the stench of about 1,500 that had died.   The statement said a female Asian elephant recently arrived inthe Dutch port of Rotterdam from Vietnam ``hidden in a largecrate.'' Her skin had dried up during the one-month journey and shewas ``in a pitiful state,'' it said. The elephant survived and isat the Rotterdam Zoo.</TEXT></DOC>
