Manuel Antonio Noriegawould bring any quick results.   ``Putting a time line on Gen. Noriega is probably one of thegreatest hazards of our profession,'' said Gen. Fred Woerner, whowas on an inspection mission to observe the arrival of about 800paratroops from the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division.   He said this week's failed coup attempt showed that the``solidarity of the Panamanian Defense Forces has been ruptured.''   Woerner ruled out the possibility of using U.S. troops to helpbring down Noriega, something he said was a matter for thePanamanian people.   He wouldn't comment on whether the United States military wouldrespond if Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle requested itsassistance in the future.   Delvalle has been in hiding since his aborted attempt to fireNoriega as military leader last month. Noriega responded by forcingthe ouster of Delvalle, but the United States still regards him asPanama's constitutional leader. Noriega has been indicted by twofederal grand juries in Florida on drug-trafficking charges.   Woerner provided a gloomy description of Panama's internalsituation in his brief remarks during the second day of maneuvershere.   ``The city is locked up. The economy has come to a standstill.The people are afraid, intimidated. The normal political processesare non-functioning. People are desperately struggling for theirbasic freedoms,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
