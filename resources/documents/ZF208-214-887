Cavanagh.andP;  &quot;The promise of X.500 is that electronic mail[users] will have the most sophisticated directory capability in the world.&quot;andM;One year ago, X.500 became a formally approved CCITT and InternationalStandards Organization (ISO) standard.andP;  Many agree, however, that althoughthis 1988 version of the standard provides a valuable starting point it is byno means complete.andP;  CCITT is hard at work on the next version, which shouldbe approved in 1992 and should fill some important technical gaps,particularly in the area of directory information access and control.andM;The Possible DreamandM;Those changes promise to be important not only for e-mail but for other formsof telecommunications, as well.andP;  Although the standard is associated mostfrequently with electronic mail, supporters say X.500 directories could storeaddress lists of phone numbers, fax machines and even printers attached tonetworks.andP;  In fact, some people dream of the day X.500 might tie togetherworldwide telephone directory services so that a call to a single number foroperator assistance could produce the number of someone in another region oranother country.andP;  &quot;ATandamp;T is very, very interested in directories.andP;  Forexample, a service could be 800 [toll free] numbers....andP;  E-mail won't be themajor consumer of this but was the major force,&quot; says Ronald Large,supervisor of unified directory architecture for ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories inMurray Hill, N.J.andM;And just as telephone companies today provide directory assistance, manyexpect X.500 directory services to be provided by Public Telephone andTelegraph companies (PTTs) and private electronic mail network operatorsalike.andP;  For instance, the Dutch, Swiss and West German PTTs are currentlycooperating to establish an X.500 certification program.andP;  The growing use ofelectronic mail networks such as MCI Mail, suggests public network companieslike MCI Communications and Telenet also will play an important role in X.500adoption.andM;Public network vendors already have held meetings to discuss technical andbilling issues associated with future X.500 implementation, says EMA'sCavanagh.andP;  However, he cautions, the fact such meetings have taken placedoesn't mean that any implementations are imminent.andP;  Nor is a worldwidetechnical convergence likely before the 1992 ISO version is released, saysCavanagh and others.andP;  Technical and other hurdles could make widespreadimplementation of X.500 unobtainable before the mid-1990s.andM;&quot;It's not at al clear how something so grandiose as a worldwide directorywill be implemented,&quot; says Steve Schramm, manager of software research anddevelopment for public network provider Tymnet.andP;  &quot;As the database gets big,how do you maintain consistency and integrity and the very, very big problemof security?&quot;andP;  Despite his questions, Schramm makes it clear that Tymnet doesplan to support X.500.andP;  He just suggests that global functionality should notbe expected any time soon.andM;Others give X.500 a better shot because of the way it has been designed.andP;  Thestandard does not call for a centralized, enormous database, which wouldtrack millions of names and addresses.andP;  Rather, the key is that directorieswill be distributed.andP;  &quot;X.500 was created to allow databases to reside asclose as possible to the electronic-mail system they serve and to letdifferent databases communicate,&quot; says Telenet's director of Telemailservices, John Sherburne.andM;To do this, X.500 depends less on database technology than on well-specifiedcommunications protocols.andP;  &quot;People tend to think you've defined a distributeddatabase protocol but, no, that's not right,&quot; says Richard Jesmajian, amember of Bell Labs' technical staff who has worked with the U.S.andP;  delegationto the CCITT/ISO.andM;It also doesn't matter if a directory uses relational or other popular typesof database technology, according to X.500 specialists.andP;  Still, somecompanies such as Tymnet are redoing their directories by converting to aStructured Query Language (SQL) database in order to conform to accepteddatabase interface standards.andP;  Schramm believes the move to a lessproprietary database will save Tymnet a lot of effort when it decides to addX.500 functions.andM;Nonetheless, there is a directory information model in X.500 that specifiesthe structure--how to represent the set of attributes of each data object.andO;This is needed so that data can be mapped from one system to another.andM;&quot;Although X.500 is a communications standard, that [label] is somewhatmisleading since it [X.500] does describe how data relates to other data andhow it should be formatted,&quot; says Marshall Rose, senior scientist withNysernet Inc.andP;  This nonprofit organization runs New York State's section ofthe Internet network and is currently the largest pilot site for X.500 in theUnited States.andM;Converting software to take advantage of the X.500 standard is no bigproblem, says Dave Bezaire, electronic product manager for H andamp; R Block Inc.'sCompuServe Inc. in Columbus, Ohio, which runs the EasyPlex mail system.andM;Conversion IssuesandM;Neither CompuServe nor the major public service suppliers will say how muchtime and money is involved in converting to X.500.andP;  Nor will they say whenthey expect to sign agreements connecting their individual directories.andM;&quot;We're starting to implement [X.500], but our exact schedule I can't giveout,&quot; says Telenet's Sherburne.andP;  &quot;At the present, we have no agreements orarrangements to exchange information with other [e-mail] providers.&quot;andP;  Ingeneral, vendors say to look for X.500 services to start in 1991.andP;  Next year,vendors say, they will be able to provide more details about when specificaspects of those services will become available.andM;To help speed the implementation process, independent groups have formed in anumber of countries.andP;  In the United States, that work has been taken on bythe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).andP;  This December,NIST is scheduled to publish new X.500 implementation guidelines based on the1988 version.andP;  Similar groups exist in Europe and Asia, although theobjective is that over time there will be a single, worldwide implementation.andM;&quot;There will have to be agreements for all these interconnections,&quot; saysTelenet's Sherburne.andP;  &quot;When we set up agreements, we probably will alsoestablish how our directories communicate.&quot;andP;  Companies must have knowledge ofhow information in other directories is laid out and how queries are routedor &quot;navigated,&quot; explains Ted Myer, chairman of communications consulting firmRapport Communication Inc. of Washington, D.C., and a longtime participant ininternational messaging standards work.andM;In addition to forging such agreements among e-mail service providers, thereare issues that the ISO and CCITT also must resolve.andP;  One of the mostprominent is the issue of standardized access controls.andP;  These controls allowdirectory owners to determine which information is restricted and which isfreely released.andP;  For example, you might want all of your employees to accessdirectory information about each other but not want outsiders to be able tolist all of the people in, say, your marketing department.andP;  How accesscontrols are set up is expected to be in the 1992 CCITT/ISO standard.andM;While not crucial to the technical operation of a directory, these controlsare important factors in making X.500 acceptable to users.andP;  Security is amajor concern to corporations, and electronic mail suppliers know it.andP;  Toinitiate a directory search, a certain amount of information is required.andO;But the specification must guard against disruptions that can be caused outof ignorance or malice.andM;What X.500 experts say probably will be required are queries with theperson's name, country, network and organization.andP;  However, the level ofdetail may also be subject to internetwork agreements.andM;It'll be up to the public networks whether they will permit access todirectory addresses by those with limited information about a subscriber,says John Stephensen, senior vice president of technology and marketing forX.500 development products supplier Retix of Santa Monica, Calif.andP;  Forexample, telephone directory services are currently not equipped to acceptrequests without a person's name, city and state or province included.andM;As the framework for a large scale electronic mail directory system continuesto evolve, more and more participants will need to get involved andcommunicate.andP;  Most of the suppliers of public services and their counterpartsin private network electronic mail software are becoming more accustomed tocooperating with one another, if only because of X.400.andP;  Standards groupsappear to be surmounting many difficult issues.andM;More Than BellsandM;So that leaves a more complex issue to be anwered.andP;  &quot;Is a directoryimportant?andP;  Can we do without it?&quot;andP;  asks ComputServe's Bezaire.andP;  After all,he points out, &quot;there are still a lot of ways to get that address.&quot;andM;But that's like asking: How important is the phone book to your business?andO;The benefits are not so much those of technological innovation as of businessefficiency.andP;  &quot;We're not talking about technological advances,&quot; Bezaire says,&quot;but a change in people's work habits.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
