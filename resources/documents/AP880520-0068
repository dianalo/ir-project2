(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actor Stuart Whitman says only half thecremated remains of his friend Peter Lawford were in an urn removedfrom a crypt this week for scattering at sea by Lawford's last wife.   ``We had this big party at my house _ a big one with champagneand toasts _ right after he died and he had been cremated,''Whitman said Thursday in a telephone interview.   ``Then we dumped half the ashes in the ocean,'' Whitman said.``He was a dear friend. He would have enjoyed it.''   Whitman, a Malibu resident, said the group of about 10 peopleincluded Lawford's last wife, Patricia Seaton Lawford.   Mrs. Lawford, reached by telephone, said she could not recall ascattering of ashes at the Dec. 26, 1984, party. She said she didattend the party, however.   On Wednesday, Mrs. Lawford scattered the remainder of Lawford'sremains in the Pacific Ocean following a dispute over payment offuneral expenses.   Lawford's ashes were taken from a crypt at Westwood VillageCemetery and turned over to Mrs. Lawford, who said Lawford'schildren by his previous wife, Patricia Kennedy Lawford, hadrefused to pay the burial bills. Patricia Kennedy Lawford is asister of the late President John F. Kennedy.   Patricia Seaton Lawford, 30, was the fourth wife of ``The ThinMan'' television star, and was at his side when he died of heartfailure at age 61.   The $10,000 funeral bill was supposed to be paid by the fourchildren Lawford had with Patricia Kennedy Lawford, Mrs. Lawfordsaid. ``The Kennedys wouldn't pay,'' she said.   However, a statement from Lawford's children in New Yorkcontradicted the unpaid funeral expenses allegation.   ``The children only recently learned of the existence offinancial problems in connection with their father's funeralexpenses and they have taken care of all such obligations. Thechildren's primary concern has always been that their father'sremains rest in peace, and they loved him.''   Only family members and a few close friends attended privateservices for Lawford on Dec. 26, 1984. Among the mourners wereLawford's children, Christopher, Sydney, Victoria and Robin.</TEXT></DOC>
