Basicand applied research on batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles wereamong the activities specified by the legislation. Over the past ten yearsDOE has searched for the battery type that would be the breakthrough forelectric vehicle transportation. The search goes on with static electrolyte,flowing electrolyte and solid electrolyte types. Progress toward achievementof the long range goals is as elusive as ever. Several battery types, intheir earliest stages of development, have exhibited high promise, butthat promise has become more and more modest as research turns up additionalproblems of a practical nature. Currently only two battery types show fieldoperational capability: Lead/acid and nickel/iron (Ni/Fe). Research workon the nickel/cadmium (Ni/Cd) battery for EV traction has focused on thenon-sintered nickel electrode, in an effort to produce a low cost Ni/Cdbattery. However, the power limitation of this technology has always beena concern. This limitation is perhaps fundamental. At issue is internal``resistance'' versus pore structure as an explanation for the battery'spoorer performance when compared with the lead/acid battery of the sameampere/hour rating. This is a paradox, because standard rechargeable Ni/Cdbatteries are popular because of their high power with high voltage crankingability. The non-sintered nickel electrode technology has a rapid temperature-risecharacteristic at high discharge rates. The high internal heat generationcauses graphite oxidation, cell swelling, and loss of cell capacity ofeach cycle following a high rate demand. The standard Ni-Cd battery technologypossesses two characteristics which make it attractive as an improved powersource of EV traction. It is a high power delivery device, as describedabove, and exhibits better operating characteristics at cold ambient temperaturesthan the lead-acid battery. Thermal management is required on battery typesthat lose their capability at low ambient temperatures. Thermal managementis a complication in the system that elevates   cost, adds bulk and weightto the vehicle, and requires energy from the battery to maintain its operatingtemperature which reduces the energy available for powering the vehicle.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope </ITAG>This technology evaluation program is designed to refocus the Ni/Cd effortsalong more conventional lines. First it is designed to evaluate availablefiber-electrode technologies and identify the best technology. Assumingthat this evaluation identifies a technology that possesses the potentialto reduce cost without sacrificing performance and live, the next effortwould be directed at identification of a suitable cadmium recombinationelectrode technology. If successful on both counts, this project couldlead to a cost-reduced Ni/Cd battery technology with low maintenance requirements.This technology would offer significant advantages over Ni/Fe batteries,which possess no known potential for gas recombination and require almostdaily watering. The applicant is to provide a concise but definitive scope of work forinclusion into any resulting agreement. The individual key tasks are tobe defined and listed in logical sequence. It is the responsibility ofthe applicant to include all items in the scope of work that are requiredto accomplish the stated purpose of the project. Each task is to be pricedseparately. DOE may choose none, all, or some combination of the tasksto be funded. As a minimum, the following tasks should be included anddiscussed in the statement of work:  1. Perform a survey of all fiber nickel and cadmium electrode technologies(without carbon or graphite additivies) available for both foreign anddomestic battery developers. Using 50 Wh/kg (at 3-hour discharge rate)as the specific energy, 120 W/kg (at 50% depth of discharge) as the peakspecific power, and ^20 to +60 anddegrees;C as the operating temperaturerange as targets, the surveyed technologies shall be ranked and currentstatus documented. 2. Build three sample cells each, of the top three rated electrode combinations(20 Ah minimum size). Charge-discharge performance shall be establishedat five different temperatures within the range of interest (room temperaturebeing one point).A second series of tests shall be performed with the cells charged at roomtemperature and then discharged at each of the five temperatures previouslychosen. Room temperature charging shall be at the 5- to 6-hour rate, withall discharging at the one-hour rate. When operating at temperatures otherthan room temperature, the charging rates shall be established at the gassingthreshold for each temperature. These thresholds will be reported as partof the cell characteristics.3. Identify the best technologies from task 2 to perform life cycle tests.Eight cells (20 Ah minimum size) are to be built. Four cells are to becycled at the one-hour discharge rate using a water bath to control temperature.The Simplified Federal Urban Driving Cycle (SFUDC) is to be run at regularintervals (i.e., every 50 cycles) to determine if any degradation of thedynamic characteristics is occurring. The objective is to determine ifthe best fiber nickel electrode, in combination with the best cadmium electrode,can achieve or exceed 1000 cycles. The life testing requirement is to extract70% of the maximum one-hour rate energy from the battery. Beginning-of-lifeperformance is to be established after 20 break-in or conditioning cycles.End-of-life is to be determined when the voltage under load drops belowthe cutoff voltage before the specified energy is delivered; or when theacceleration fails to meet the driving cycle requirements on two consecutivecycles or twice during the same cycle on the SFUDC regime. Cutoff voltagemay not be defined lower than sixty percent (60%) of the open circuit voltage.The remaining four cells are to be sent to an independent testing facilitydesignated by DOE.4. Survey the available cadmium recombination electrode technologies andreport on the feasibility of using one or more of these technologies tobuild sealed or low maintenance batteries. The objective is to prove thepotential for one-year (minimum) maintenance-free operation in an EV tractionapplication. Noble metal catalysts are not an acceptable alternative toa recombining electrode technology.5. Build eight cells (20 Ah minimum size) of the type from Task 3 and includethe best cadmium recombination electrode, if the recombination technologyshows promise. Establish a test plan and test four cells to show the effectivenessof the recombination electrode. Testing shall include an initial chargecurrent equivalent to a 5- to 6-hour discharge rate, with allowance fortaper current charging after 80% SOC. The data must be usable to definethe maximum taper charge current that the recombination electrode can accommodate.The applicant will send the remaining four cells to a test facility designatedby DOE.6. Demonstrate scale-up of the chosen technologies: (1) Build six full-sizeEV cells (150-200 Ah capacity) and (2) upon approval from DOE, build eightfull-size 6-volt modules for delivery.7. Prepare a detailed weight and cost analysis of the technology used intasks 3 and 5. The analysis shall highlight costly materials and manufacturingareas. This analysis shall identify and address the high-cost aspects ofmass production; e.g., inherent materials costs and/or high-cost stepsin the production process (due to high labor requirements, expensive equipment,low production rates, and/or low yields).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Any hazardous waste produced or the handling of hazardousmaterial must be handled in accordance with applicable EPA and/or OSHAregulations.
