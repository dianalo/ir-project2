Over Britain's objections, the 49-nation Commonwealth set up acommittee of eight foreign envoys to review the effect of sanctionsagainst South Africa and put pressure on it to grant full rights tothe black majority.   The panel ends two days of talks today. The Commonwealth groupsBritain and former colonies.   Nigeria's former head of state, Maj. Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo,told reporters Tuesday that Mozambique and the Commonwealth statesaround South Africa, which he toured in March and April, requested``non-lethal'' items ranging from army uniforms for Mozambique tospare aircraft parts for Tanzania. He declined to list weaponssought, but said Canada and other Western countries were not askedto supply arms.   ``Lethal items will be very difficult for any democraticpolitical leadership in the West to sell,'' said Obasanjo.   But he added: ``As a former military man, the distinctionbetween lethal and non-lethal aid is semantic, because food can belethal. An army marches on a full stomach.''   He said most of the countries need transportation andcommunications equipment, clothing and medical supplies after SouthAfrican raids.   Commonwealth officials said Botswana asked for assistance intraining its police force and Zimbabwe requested aerial photoequipment.   Obasanjo singled out Mozambique as the most needy, and said itwas senseless for Canada to provide aid _ about $16 million _ forthe construction of the Limpopo railway line without paying toprotect it from South African sabotage.   The railway will provide an alternative seaward route forlandlocked Zimbabwe, Zambia and Botswana, making them lessdependent on South Africa.   Foreign Minister Joe Clark said Canada will not provide militaryaid but might donate items such as communications equipment anduniforms.   Britain is firmly opposed to sanctions against South Africa, butis providing military training for Zimbabwe and Mozambique.   Its prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, criticized theCommonwealth ministers and said she would ``always shrink'' fromeconomic sanctions because they hurt South African blacks.   ``The enormous problems that country has of getting rid ofapartheid will not be helped by a comfortable luncheon ... in afive-star hotel deciding there should be poverty and starvation onthe part of a large number of black people,'' she said in Canberra,Australia.   She said big foreign companies were helping to break downapartheid by building racially integrated housing and payingemployees on merit.   Also at the meeting, the foreign ministers of Canada, Australia,Guyana, India, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe discussed areport on South Africa's international financial links, reviewedthe effect of sanctions and examined the poorly enforced armsembargo against Pretoria.   The finance report said the refusal of major world banks to loannew funds to South Africa has had the biggest effect.   It also spelled out possible new sanctions the Commonwealthcould adopt, including a boycott of all banks making new loans toSouth Africa, an international ban on export credit insuranceguarantees and restrictions on trade credits.   Any recommendations from the group must go to the entireCommonwealth, which meets again in Malaysia next year.   In Pretoria, South Africa, Canadian Ambassador Robert Macleanwas summoned to the Foreign Ministry and told the activitiesamounted to ``blatant interference in the internal affairs of SouthAfrica.''   But Clark told reporters ``it's perfectly proper for us to beinvolved in the sponsorship of a forum.''   Three Canadian anti-apartheid groups issued a statement urgingthe government to sever diplomatic and economic links with SouthAfrica and aid the African National Congress, the banned groupfighting the white-dominated government in South Africa.   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites control theeconomy and government and live apart from the 26 million blacks,who have no vote in national affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
