Col. Ralph Hayles seemed to have it all: commandof an elite Army helicopter strike force, rave reviews fromsuperiors, the fast track to an early general's star, and astone mansion supplied by the service where his familyawaited the return of their hero.   Suddenly, he blew it all away. In the desert darkness onFeb. 17, Col. Hayles pulled the red trigger on his AH-64AApache gunship, launching two Hellfire missiles. They slammedinto U.S. armored vehicles more than two miles away, killingtwo American soldiers.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Friendly fire, they call it. What a name for tragedy thatdestroys everything it touches,&quot; he says, his voice crackingwhile he unpacks his silver flight suit in a living room fullof books on the military and aviation. Gone is the arrogancehe once displayed in bragging that he knew more than hisinstructors. Gone, too, is the gung-ho bravado that sometimesannoyed -- and unnerved -- colleagues.   Since the accident, the 42-year-old combat pilot has beengrounded and stripped of command, reassigned in disgrace as alow-level adviser to National Guard units on weekend trainingand evicted from his Army house. He still faces possiblereduction in rank and the threat of a lawsuit from the familyof a dead soldier.   Haunted by the mishap, he daydreams about his own death.In a misty sort of military heaven, he embraces his victimswhile they are honored with a 21-gun salute. &quot;I haven'tfigured out yet how to live with this,&quot; he says.   The story of Col. Hayles illustrates the personalcataclysm behind &quot;friendly fire&quot; statistics. Deaths of thissort happen in every war: in World War II roughly 5,800 U.S.soldiers died from friendly fire -- 814 in one miscalculatedbombing run in France alone (no one was disciplined in thatincident). In Vietnam and Korea, such deaths accounted for 2%to 3% of fatalities. In the Gulf War, the figure was a muchlarger 23%, but that's partly because the total number ofAmericans killed in combat in the Gulf was so small (148) andbecause the Iraqis were so ineffective in inflicting injuryon U.S. forces.   Still, the losses in the Persian Gulf underscore the needto reduce the risk to U.S. soldiers from their ownincreasingly lethal weapons. A spokesman for Martin MariettaCorp., maker of the Apache's infrared night-vision system,concedes that pilots &quot;may not be able to tell if it's anIraqi tank or a U.S. tank.&quot; The General Accounting Office isinvestigating flaws in the Apache's targeting devices.   But for Col. Hayles, there will be no second chance -- andnone of the glory that other Persian Gulf veterans got. Hewasn't invited on July 4 when his unit, the First InfantryDivision (&quot;The Big Red One&quot;), marched in review before Sen.Bob Dole at Fort Riley, Kan. Instead, Col. Hayles, wearingshorts and a T-shirt, decorated his sons' bicycle and redwagon with streamers for a civilian neighborhood celebration.&quot;I don't want people to know I'm a soldier anymore,&quot; he says.   There were 33 other U.S. casualties from friendly fire,but Col. Hayles is the only person to be disciplined.Pentagon officials say his transgression wasn't the deaths somuch as it was ignoring his commander's guideline thathigh-ranking officers should manage, not shoot.   Nonetheless, the Army's quick decision to cashier Col.Hayles raises questions about its handling of his case.Pilots in his command, including some who flew on theill-fated mission, say he is being made a scapegoat forhigher-ranking officers who ordered the Apaches to fly in a35-mile-an-hour sandstorm to hunt targets close to U.S.armored troops using sights that can't distinguish friendlyvehicles. Moreover, ground commanders near the Apaches urgedthem to shoot, but Col. Hayles hovered for five minutes whilerechecking his target instruments before agreeing.   First Infantry Division officials abruptly closed theHayles investigation after two days last February, justbefore the ground war began. Other pilots on the mission saythey weren't interviewed about the brief reports they wroteon the shooting. &quot;An accident report in Army aviation usuallytakes weeks or months of looking at all the human andmaintenance factors,&quot; says Capt. Daniel Garvey, co-pilot inCol. Hayles's Apache that night. He says reopening the case&quot;might offer some cures for the future.&quot;   Col. Hayles, a veteran of 16 years of flying, is reveredby many of his men. &quot;He's the best qualified aviationcommander I ever worked for,&quot; says Chief Warrant OfficerChuck Hutchison, a Vietnam veteran and Apache pilot. Evenafter the accident, a written evaluation of Col. Hayles byhis immediate boss, Col. James Mowery, states, &quot;Impeccableintegrity. Commanded the most disciplined unit in thebrigade.&quot;   The 6-foot-2-inch Col. Hayles was intense, to say theleast. As head of the First Infantry Division's FirstAviation Battalion, he ordered subordinates to salute withthe greeting, &quot;Gunfighters, sir.&quot; Superiors returning salutehad to respond, &quot;Attack.&quot; He designed custom-made blue flyingscarves depicting Apache helicopters, distributed blueT-shirts with the &quot;Gunfighters&quot; nickname emblazoned on thefront and decorated his office with a painting of twogunslingers in the old West facing off on a dusty streetwhile a helicopter hovers in the distance. Even in the sandof the Saudi Arabian desert, he made his 291 men shine theirboots each day.   The son of an oil-field welder from Corpus Christi, Texas,Col. Hayles hadn't envisioned a military career. He won abaseball scholarship to Trinity University in San Antonio anddreamed of playing professionally. But arm soreness limitedhis pitching. While his grades as a business major wereaverage, he thrived at Trinity's Reserve Officer TrainingCorps classes and won a bronze medal as the top cadet insummer camp training. It's inscribed: &quot;Awarded forLeadership, Soldierly Bearing and Excellence.&quot;   While many ambitious young officers pursued graduatedegrees to enhance their resumes, Col. Hayles applied for onecombat training assignment after another. &quot;I decided tobecome the complete warrior,&quot; he says. His leadership of anarmored cavalry troop in Germany in 1979 brought thisevaluation from then Lt. Col. James Lyle: &quot;Tactically, I havenever seen better.&quot; And from Col. Robert Wagner: &quot;He has nopeer within his age group in the Army.&quot;   In mock battles fought with lasers, the rising combatofficer developed a bold style of commanding from the front.When he switched from that strategy while leading Cobrahelicopters in a war game with tanks at Fort Irwin, Calif.,in 1985, his pilots &quot;hit&quot; five friendly vehicles with lasers.&quot;I was to the rear reading reports, and I got into trouble. Imade up my mind that from then on I would be in front, whereI could see the action,&quot; he says.   Col. Hayles won his biggest job in October 1989: leader ofthe First Infantry's Apache unit, a select antitank troopthat clears the way for the Army's most acclaimed groundforce. Fantasizing about such a job on an earlier vacation,he spent a day walking Normandy Beach, where the FirstInfantry led the invasion of France in World War II. &quot;I lovethat division, and I would never do anything to bring itdishonor,&quot; he says.   Yet by May 1990, Col. Hayles was quietly being brandedsomething of a renegade for his combat tactics. He recalls aninstructor's oral reprimand at Fort Hood, Texas, on the lastnight of a combat training course on Apache attack strategy.&quot;He wanted me to the rear, studying maps with a flashlight. Ijust wouldn't do it.&quot;   The rebuke wasn't formalized into a written blot on hisrecord, and he was soon among the top officers chosen toattend the service's War College in Carlisle, Pa., a groomingrite for future generals.   Then came the Gulf War. Camped about 60 miles south of theIraqi border, his unit at first merely patrolled the alliedforces' perimeter. But in the first two weeks of February,his helicopters were ordered out nearly every night to checkreports by ground troops of approaching Iraqi vehicles. Theywere false alarms.   Ironically, Col. Hayles reported his patrol had been thetarget of friendly fire -- at least three shots -- from thecannon of a U.S. tank the night of Feb. 1. The shots missed,and Col. Hayles later warned his pilots they could be courtmartialed for shooting too quickly.   On a Feb. 15 day patrol, two Apaches, without Col. Haylesalong, mistakenly fired on an Army scout vehicle. Theymissed, but he grounded the crewmen for further deserttraining.   At 12:15 a.m. on moonless Feb. 17, the First Infantry'sheadquarters radioed for an Apache attack on enemy vehiclesreportedly approaching a U.S. column of armor 25 miles northof Col. Hayles's camp. &quot;I decided to send myself and twoother Apaches,&quot; he says.&quot;I had never flown in weather thatbad -- zero visibility and wind that was nearly blowing overmy tent -- and I wouldn't order my people out in that withoutme,&quot; he says.   The pilots' driver became briefly lost in the sandstorm onthe 100-yard trip to the helicopter pad. The crew chiefgreeted Col. Hayles: &quot;Gunfighters, sir. Are you really goingup in this?&quot;   The three Apaches launched at 12:22 a.m.; they carried atotal of 38 Hellfire missiles, each able to sink a small ship-- or destroy a heavily armored vehicle.   At 12:50 a.m., the Apaches discovered two suspiciousvehicles. Col. Hayles calculates they were nearlythree-quarters of a mile in front of the American armor'spatrol line. But the location of the targets that morning isnow in dispute, and it's apparent Col. Hayles misread theirexact distance from other friendly forces.   Ground commanders insist the targeted Americans weren't infront of other U.S. armor at all -- merely flanked off totheir side. Yet other pilots on the mission say groundcommanders repeatedly urged them to fire. &quot;They were emphaticthat vehicles out ahead of them were enemy,&quot; says Capt.Garvey.   An eerie premonition prompted Col. Hayles to first firehis 30mm cannons, which would inflict far less damage thanmissiles and allow time for friendly vehicles to alert othersof their predicament. But his cannons jammed.   At 12:59 a.m., he sent two Hellfires on a six-secondflight into a Bradley fighting vehicle and an M-113 armoredpersonnel carrier, each carrying four soldiers. Flames shot100 feet in the air, and one survivor reported an explosion&quot;like the inside of a volcano.&quot; When ammunition from the twovehicles lit up the sky for several minutes, other groundforces discovered what had really happened, and relayed thebad news to the Apaches.   &quot;I was afraid of that,&quot; replied Col. Hayles, softly. Herecalls, &quot;We just hovered out there, in the horror, andwatched it all.&quot;   After returning to his launch pad, Col. Hayles sat in thecockpit for half an hour. &quot;I didn't want to cry in front ofthe men,&quot; he says.   Sworn statements of other pilots on the mission say Col.Hayles shouldn't be blamed. &quot;There was radio traffic from theground encouraging the shooting. If any of us had even theslightest misgiving, we wouldn't have fired,&quot; said WarrantOfficer Kelly Gulker. Chief Warrant Officer Casper LeBlancadded: &quot;I truly believed we were engaging Iraqi vehicles.&quot;   Yet it took only two days for Maj. Gen. Thomas Rhame, theFirst Division commander and a nonpilot, to decide todiscipline Col. Hayles. In firing his air-attack leader, Gen.Rhame reasoned in part that he had recently issued an oralguideline -- short of a direct order -- that battalioncommanders avoid personally firing on the enemy so they couldfocus on directing others. &quot;We don't pay generals andbattalion commanders to be in direct-fire situations,&quot; hesays.   The dismissal is a rare event in the annals offriendly-fire incidents. &quot;I don't know of an honest mistakein Vietnam or Korea that resulted in disciplinary action,&quot;says Charles R. Shrader, former chief of history at the ArmyWar College. Some associates of Col. Hayles had longconsidered his style too showy -- and too aggressive. Seniorofficers outside his battalion simply ignored his&quot;Gunfighters&quot; saluting slogan. Col. Hayles says he is awarehis enthusiasm annoyed some. &quot;There isn't much differencebetween a hotdog and a great pilot. A totally sane persondoesn't take off in a sandstorm in a helicopter loaded downwith missiles,&quot; he says.   The Army delivered the dismissal decision to Col. Hayles'swife as it would a death notification. A colonel and an Armywife knocked on Diana Hayles's door at Fort Riley amid rumorsthat an Apache had killed U.S. soldiers. Trembling, sheblurted, &quot;Ralph's dead?&quot; When they shook their heads glumly,she knew: &quot;My God, he fired those missiles.&quot;   Several of Col. Hayles's pilots defend his right to shoot.&quot;I never heard that a colonel can't pull the trigger,&quot; saysChief Warrant Officer Hutchison. Some who flew for Gen. Rhamesay they thought his guideline was flexible in combat. Otherssay the rule is out of step with much Army training.&quot;Officers are taught to take charge -- to lead,&quot; says retiredCol. Clark Burnett, formerly head of combat development atthe U.S. Army Aviation School.   The lore of commanders firing could fill an Army historybook. As a lieutenant colonel in World War II, CreightonAbrams &quot;wore out at least four&quot; Thunderbolt tanks &quot;shootingat everything in sight,&quot; says John Cranston, a historian atthe Patton Museum at Fort Knox, Ky. Then there's Gen. GeorgePatton himself, who led tank charges and was wounded doingit.   None of this is any solace to the family of Cpl. JefferyMiddleton, who idolized Gen. Patton and was killed by Col.Hayles. In a high-school shop class, he had made a clock withthe &quot;Hell On Wheels&quot; insignia of Gen. Patton's Second ArmoredDivision. Mr. Middleton was 23 and a newlywed.   His parents say it's cowardly of Col. Hayles to avoidvisiting, or at least phoning to apologize. &quot;He should havesaid, `Damn it, I killed your son,'&quot; says Bill Middleton, whoworks at a Boeing Co. plant in Wichita, Kan.   But on Aug. 10, Col. Hayles did write the family. The deadsoldier's mother unfolds the note, and recites it almost byheart:   &quot;It is with deep sorrow and regret that I write you todayas the Army officer who fired the missile that resulted inthe tragic death of your son, Jeffery. I am so very sorry.   &quot;As you can see from the enclosed picture of my family, Ihave two young sons. I am having great difficulty living withthe sorrow of this accident, since I am a loving father andcan only imagine the horror this has brought you. What aterrible thing war is, and friendly fire accidents are such apainful loss. I would like to come visit you. You need tohear the details from me, and I need to tell you in personhow sorry I am,&quot; the letter reads.   Mrs. Middleton says she can't yet forgive Col. Hayles, butshe'll see him soon, hoping their talk will make him lesstroubled and thus a better parent. &quot;Jeff would want it thatway,&quot; she says, crying.   Meanwhile, Col. Hayles, scheduled to retire in November,stores his military memorabilia in a closet, away from thefascination of his sons. But the boys, who don't know aboutthe accident, cling to a glamorous image of combat.Two-year-old Trace points to a plastic model Apache andproudly tells a visitor where his father sits: &quot;By the guns.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
