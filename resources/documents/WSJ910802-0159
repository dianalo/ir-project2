The most significant shift in Taiwan's favor came on July21, when, amid heated debate between the Bush administrationand Congress over China's trade status, the White Houseagreed to support Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade. By doing so, the U.S. signaled it wouldhelp Taiwan play a role in multilateral institutions thatreflects the island's growing economic power.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, those Americans who help formulatepolicy toward China and Taiwan have been making unusuallyblunt statements that analysts say will give the authoritiesin Taipei added confidence as they pursue their fledglingrelationship with the mainland. These Americans havecriticized what they call Beijing's &quot;outmoded&quot; notion ofsovereignty over Taiwan and have spoken approvingly ofeconomic and political policies that they say are creating aTaiwan identity separate from China.   These shifts in the U.S. approach come as other Westerncountries are taking steps to improve their relations withTaiwan. British officials this week are conducting theirfirst trade consultations in Taipei. At a recent newsconference, British Undersecretary of Trade and Industry JohnMeadway, the head of the London delegation, expressed supportfor Taiwan's GATT bid. Also, Taiwan's economics minister,Vincent Siew, on Monday returned from Taiwan's firstministerial-level visit to Australia since Canberra formallyrecognized Beijing in 1972.   Taiwanese officials have reacted cautiously to the recentAmerican initiatives, drawing a distinction between PresidentBush's decision on GATT and other statements and actions. TheGATT decision &quot;is very helpful in letting people know how theU.S. feels about our application,&quot; says Chen Chien-jen,Taiwan's vice minister for foreign affairs responsible forNorth America. &quot;{It} is a recognition of the importance ofour role in world trade.&quot;   But Mr. Chen says other developments &quot;do not represent thepolicies of the U.S. administration as far as I know.&quot; Still,he adds, perhaps they are &quot;significant in the sense that somepeople in the U.S. have taken into account the developmentsin&quot; the Republic of China. &quot;After all, the ROC of today isnot the same as the ROC of 10 years ago.&quot;   A central figure in the recent developments in U.S.-Taiwanrelations has been the former American ambassador to Beijing,James Lilley, who is widely expected to be nominated for ahigh-level post in the Bush administration. Mr. Lilley made aprivate visit to Taiwan last week to see old friends such asPresident Lee Teng-hui and Prime Minister Hau Pei-tsun. Buthe did so with a high profile, and he made several pointedstatements that seemed intended to boost Taipei's morale andprick Beijing's pride.   &quot;The U.S. faces domestic pressures that drive it in thedirection of a more confrontational relationship with China,&quot;said Mr. Lilley in an interview. While the U.S. must continueto &quot;emphasize relations with China and keep them moving,&quot; headded, &quot;we can do a hell of a lot with Taiwan relationswithin that context.&quot;   In the course of his six-day visit, which also includedmeetings with the ministers of defense and foreign affairsand opposition politicians, Mr. Lilley said he exchangedviews on developments in both Taiwan and China. He said hesought to encourage Taiwan's leaders in their commitment topolitical liberalization and the island's slow rapprochementwith China.   &quot;I told them, `You are a lot more popular around the worldthan you were 10 years ago. Don't blow it by pushing too hardfor {U.S. diplomatic} recognition or undermining China,'&quot;said Mr. Lilley. &quot;There's a greater sense of confidence {inTaiwan} in dealing with China. But I think there's a lot lessconfidence in dealing with {Taiwan's} domestic situation.&quot;   On several occasions during his visit, Mr. Lilley deridedBeijing's insistence on a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; approachto reunification with Taiwan as &quot;outmoded.&quot;   &quot;What I was really trying to get across in saying that is:Don't let those guys in China dominate the game of layingdown principles,&quot; said Mr. Lilley. The Beijing authorities&quot;are in no position to dictate anything,&quot; he added.   Because the U.S. doesn't formally recognize theNationalist government in Taiwan, any American initiatives insupport of Taipei are obscured by the inevitable disclaimersthat statements and gestures represent only individual views,and that Washington remains committed to a &quot;One China&quot;policy.   Nonetheless, there is wide agreement among analysts inTaiwan that the U.S. is consciously raising the profile ofits Taiwan policy in the wake of the Bush administration'salmost certain victory in the debate over China'smost-favored-nation trading status. They say that byfrustrating the congressional attempt to place restrictionson renewal of China's MFN privileges, the administration hasgained greater diplomatic leverage with Beijing. U.S.lawmakers have sought the restrictions to put pressure onChina to improve its human rights record and reduce itsinternational arms sales, but relevant legislation failed topass with a wide enough margin in the Senate to override apresidential veto.   Chi Su, deputy director of the Institute for InternationalRelations at National Chengchi University in Taipei, says theshift in U.S. policy can be discerned most clearly bycomparing recent American statements with what was being saida year ago. At a conference on Taiwan at Columbia Universityin New York last year, he says, U.S. governmentrepresentatives offered opinions similar to those receivingattention now -- but they would state them only privately.&quot;This time, it's coming out strongly,&quot; he says.   One such position was presented publicly earlier thismonth by Natale H. Bellochi, chairman of the AmericanInstitute in Taiwan, a private organization tied to the U.S.State Department that manages Washington's unofficialrelationship with Taiwan. In a paper on political reform inTaiwan presented to a conference at Pennsylvania StateUniversity, Mr. Bellochi said: &quot;Taiwan's already-growingeconomic strength, an undeniable factor on the internationalscene, provides it with the influence and the confidence toassert itself more aggressively in both foreign policy andmainland relations.&quot; This development, he said, has led tothe evolution of a &quot;separate Taiwan identity&quot; that &quot;willbecome even more pronounced as the political and economic gapwidens with the mainland.&quot;   Mr. Lilley said the recent American statements are boundto anger Beijing. &quot;We're going to get some harsh terminologyat some point&quot; from China, he said, &quot;but as long as we don'tcross certain lines, I think it will be all right.&quot; One suchline, he said, would be to offer formal recognition toTaiwan.   Analysts in Taiwan say the recent American actions andstatements should boost confidence among Taiwanese policymakers. Chen Pi-chao, a professor of political science atWayne State University in Michigan who is conducting researchin Taipei, says that the Lilley and Bellochi statements willbe interpreted as U.S. support for the government's strategyof using political liberalization to strengthen its hand withthe mainland. The government is pursuing constitutionalreforms that will sharply increase the role of directlyelected representatives in Taiwan's legislative bodies.Meanwhile, it advocates a mainland policy based for now oninformal relations and indirect economic ties.   &quot;Further democratization will further enhance thelegitimacy of the ruling {Nationalist} party and thegovernment in the eyes of the people of Taiwan,&quot; Mr. Chensays, &quot;and that will further enhance Taiwan's bargainingposition.&quot;   Mr. Su of the Institute for International Relations saysPresident Lee's government also is receiving the message fromthe U.S. that it is correct to emphasize political reform atthe moment. &quot;I have always advocated in public and privatethat we should go slower on mainland policy and faster onconstitutional reform,&quot; Mr. Su says. &quot;And this is what Iunderstand Mr. Lilley told our leaders. This is what ourgovernment will do.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
