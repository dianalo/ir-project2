As a result of these studies, itbecame clear of silica core fibers could not be expected. Therefore,they began investigations of liquid core optical fibers which, in principle,should be &quot;self-healing&quot; and have, then, much higher damage thresholds.The authors' first experiments used small diameter glass tubes 8 cm long,3 mm outer diameter and with a 1 mm bore. A sample tube was positionedaxially inside a pair of telescoping glass tubes. These outer tubes weresealed together through o-rings, and their outside ends were sealed withoptical windows about 3 mm thick. This assembly was then filled withdistilled water and mounted on a multiaxis positioner on an optical table.Pulses from a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser was focused through onewindow of this assembly to a point about 1 cm down the length of thesample tube. The focal length of the coupling lens was 5 cm. The pulserepetition rate was approximately 10 per second. The authors repeatedthis experiment with carbon tetrachloride and again observed the retrogradedischarge, both with and without damage to the cell's optical window.</TEXT></DOC>
