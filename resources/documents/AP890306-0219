It has oneyear to show the Detroit diocese why it should not be closed, alongwith many others that have already been shut down. Rosary is notextbook parish, but it serves a clientele with special needs.</TEXT><NOTE>By GRETEL WIKLE</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   On Coming Home Sunday, the Rev. Thomas J. McAnoyturns to the visitors in the back of his church and apologizes.   ``We're notoriously late,'' the priest confesses as children hopfrom a bus outside and bound into the red sandstone Roman Catholicchurch once occupied by Episcopalians.   McAnoy's church, Our Lady of the Rosary, is less than a textbookparish in many ways, the priest explains.   As the organ strikes up, McAnoy, who is crippled, moves to thelectern to begin his service. He opens with a discussion of Jesusand Penthouse magazine.   McAnoy is referring to a sketch hanging at the rear of thesanctuary, a picture of Christ in an obvious expression of mirth.The sketch seems appropriate for the themeless decor at Our Lady ofthe Rosary, a parish celebrating its centennial this year with itsfuture in question.   ``That picture first appeared in Penthouse magazine, and theofficial church was,'' the priest pauses, ``chagrined to say theleast.''   But the picture is a favorite of the 59-year-old priest whosedefiance dates to his days in the seminary when he let a woman _ hisyounger sister _ ride with him in the front seat of the car.   ``I look at it whenever I get down in the dumps,'' McAnoy says.   There have been reasons for McAnoy to get down in the dumps oflate. On Jan. 8, Cardinal Edmund Szoka labeled Rosary ``questionablyviable,'' along with 24 other city churches. Szoka also announcedthat 30 of the 112 Catholic churches in Detroit would be closed inan unprecedented retrenchment.   Szoka said ``questionably viable'' churches would have one yearto prove their viability or also face closing.   McAnoy, a priest for 35 years, is known as Mac to Rosary'seclectic parishioners, most of whom live in the blightedneighborhood that lies in the shadow of the General Motors Corp.world headquarters.   The golden statue atop the building is visible from Interstate 94just south of the church, which now shares a block with servicestation and is the emergency shelter for a corrections center acrossthe street.   Once attended almost exclusively by working-class Europeanimmigrant families, Rosary's congregation is about 60 percent white,25 percent black and 15 percent Asian. They include professionals,laborers and recovering alcoholics, along with handicapped people.   Rosary's handicapped members live in 44 group homes in theneighborhood. Every year they are treated to a party at the church.The celebration starts as the handicapped people are collected in acaravan weaving behind businesses on Woodward Avenue, near thecampus of Wayne State University and the Detroit headquarters ofUnisys Corp.   Parishioner Patrick Gossman, a suburbanite who works at WayneState, says about 40 of the church's 477 members live in the grouphomes, which have proliferated in the neighborhood because of thetrend toward moving handicapped people out of institutions andbecause real estate is cheap.   ``I don't know if these people would be accepted anywhere else,''Gossman says.   This year's party was another activity on Coming Home Sunday. The270 guests included an unshaven man who wandered around the church,pant legs dragging the floor, and a man who lip-synced a spiritedconversation with someone who wasn't there. Another mistook abaptismal font for an offertory bowl and dropped a nickel into theempty stone.   Many are physically handicapped and find the pewless churchcomfortable. If they want to meander, rock in their chairs or prayas if God were hard of hearing, no one bothers them.   ``The best thing is the subtle way the developmentally disabledare accepted, especially those who are regular,'' says Norbert Kidd,president of the church council and an English teacher at Detroit'sSpain Middle School. ``It's authentic. It's not put on.''   Mac knows the problems of the handicapped.   A recovering alcoholic, the priest had one of his legs amputated2{ years ago because of poor circulation caused in part by alcohol,something he has lived without for 11 years. He gets around in awheelchair except during Mass when he stands to preach with the aidof a prosthesis.   ``One of the things you hear in Father Mac's sermons is, `Ifyou're not perfect, that's OK. Look at me,''' Gossman says.   The church's work with handicapped people, however, won't beenough to see it through its period of probation. Szoka says hewants the parish to build a larger presence at Wayne StateUniversity and to devote more effort to promoting the rosary.   ``That the cardinal has challenged us to do the evangelization isno problem,'' says Bob Van Cleef, a member of Rosary and a lawyerhelping some of the 30 closing churches appeal the decision to theVatican. ``But on the other hand, there's a bit of cynicism aboutthe evangelization because the archbishop has never guided us.''   Church members also are optimistic because money isn't a pressingproblem. A large part of Rosary's $85,000 budget last year came frominterest on an investment of about $110,000.   ``We have no bills, no mortgage and the property is basically ingood repair,'' Kidd says.   Still, financing will be a question when the church is asked toprove itself next December.   Kidd says the church will have to collect more than the $26,000that came from offerings last year, but he says people have begundropping more in the collection plate since the crisis.   Kidd thinks the church's location, in an area he said is destinedto be a center of urban growth and development, helped it win areprieve.   The diocese, he says, just didn't realize how much activity wasplanned for the area when it proposed closing Rosary because ofstagnation.   The city's Community and Economic Development Department says newhousing is slated for a wide expanse of land two blocks from thechurch and the Veterans Administration has announced plans to builda hospital inside the parish's boundary.   Kidd says it's ironic the church must turn its attention tosurvival at the same time it prepares for its centennial Aug. 24. Onthat day 100 years ago, the parish held its first Mass in the diningroom of a home off a muddy path that was Woodward Avenue.   The one-year reprieve, and the hope it brings for continued lifeat Rosary, is cause for celebrating early.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 19</NOTE></DOC>
