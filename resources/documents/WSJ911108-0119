Chairman John F.Akers reiterated positive comments about the computer maker'sfourth-quarter outlook, sending IBM's stock price up $3.25 to$99.875.   Speaking at a news conference in Japan, Mr. Akers saidIBM's laggard financial performance &quot;bottomed out during thesummer and is showing signs of improvement.&quot; He also saidthat &quot;we believe the fourth quarter will be our strongest ofthe year.&quot; In addition, Mr. Akers said profit at IBM'sJapanese subsidiary, the company's largest outside the U.S.,will show improvement during the second half of 1991,compared with the year-earlier period; securities analystshave said profit declined in the first half.</LP><TEXT>   The fourth quarter is almost always IBM's best of theyear, and the other comments mirrored the company'scautiously positive remarks in its third-quarter earningsrelease three weeks ago. But securities analysts saidinvestors took comfort from the remarks, feeling that theymeant earnings estimates might not have to be cut again, eventhough they have been steadily declining all year.   &quot;He didn't say anything new, but the fact that he said itgave people some confidence,&quot; said Jay Stevens, an analyst atDean Witter Reynolds Inc.   The stock apparently also benefited from the fact that ithad dropped Wednesday to $96.625 in New York Stock Exchangecomposite trading. That meant that IBM's annual dividend of$4.84 gave the stock a yield above 5%, a significant levelfor a company as stable as IBM.   Analysts said IBM's stock may also be drawing support fromrumors of further restructuring. IBM normally holds a meetingof its couple of hundred top managers toward the end ofJanuary but has moved the meeting up to the first week ofDecember. Analysts said that indicates a sense of urgency. Itcould just mean that Mr. Akers wants to get a running starton 1992, when IBM hopes that new products and a strongereconomy will help it reverse the problems that will cutearnings this year to around $4 a share, from $6.02 billion,or $10.51 a share, last year.   Mr. Akers also has scheduled a meeting with analysts forearly December, the first such meeting in nearly three years,and analysts speculated that he will have something ofsubstance to say.   At the news conference yesterday, Mr. Akers also indicatedIBM could move some computer assembly to Japan if the U.S.government doesn't lift a recently added tariff onJapanese-made flat computer screens. Mr. Akers said IBM,which has said it plans to import such screens, &quot;hasn'tconcluded what to do.&quot; He said, &quot;We could assemble completecomputer systems in Japan to avoid the tariff.&quot; He added: &quot;Itisn't easy to see why that's good for the U.S.&quot; Many U.S.computer makers have threatened similar action.</TEXT></DOC>
