So I asked him about the KGB family jewels.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  KGB'S CHIEF PLAYS IT COY ON JFK KILLING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Commentary; William Safire is a New York Times columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Did the KGB train Lee Harvey Oswald in Minsk and send him to Dallas to killPresident Kennedy?;   &quot;I checked it. I did not find any evidence to supportsuspicion that he was our man,&quot; Bakatin said.;   Where is the Oswald file?;  &quot;I wanted to give the file to American journalists, but your networks arecompeting and I will do it through Soviet television.&quot;;   Celestine Bohlen ofthe New York Times promptly offered to take the dossier then and there, endingthe CNN-ABC rivalry, but Bakatin demurred. Then why not just release it toeveryone at once and cut out the media manipulation? &quot;We will do that -- intwo or three months.&quot;;   Follow-up to the JFK murder: Did the KGB send itsYuri Nosenko to the United States as a false defector to assuage FBIsuspicions about Soviet involvement? A debate about this has raged within theCIA for a generation.;   The KGB chief put on a who's-Nosenko look, professingto be ignorant of the whole affair. Either Bakatin has a great poker face, orhas not been briefed by his veteran KGB handlers, or does not want to know.;  Then what about the attempted murder of the pope -- did the KGB run thatthrough its Bulgarian subsidiary? &quot;This information about the pope was not inthe archives,&quot; he replied, then derogated the search with, &quot;I am notinterested in studying detective stories.&quot; He wants to look ahead to reputablecounterespionage, crime-fighting and anti-terrorism, cooperating with the CIAon &quot;some rules of the game, not barbaric.&quot;;   No; first let's look back. TheKGB and its successors will remain a cesspool of evil until they come clean.That does not mean holding up a dusty file and saying, &quot;See? Empty.&quot; This mancould call a half-dozen operatives into his office, demand that answers befound from living sources and present the damning, cleansing truth in a week-- if he were so inclined. He is not. (Why doesn't President Bush ask hisfriend Gorbachev for the answers?);   Let's try another line of questioning tosee if the new boss of the KGB deserves his media reputation as dismantler ofthe brutal agency of repression. What happened to the half-million people inthe KGB network?;   He was admirably forthcoming: about half were borderguards, spun off into an independent command. Another separate agency wascreated to protect leaders in wartime, and one for &quot;communications,&quot; which Itake to include a Big Ear. Some 20,000 are moving to the Russian Republic'sown KGB, and foreign spying was made a separate agency.;   He whipped out anorganization chart, pointed to a figure at the bottom -- 39,492 -- andsnatched it back (unaware of my photographic memory). That's what's left tohim, and he says half are cooks, mechanics and clerks. Behold -- a KGB a tenthof its former size.;   But of the original half-million, how many wereactually fired? &quot;Several dozen who were involved in the putsch. Also, veteranswith 25 years' service, on an individual basis.&quot; And he won't fill vacantslots.;   That's only, say, 36 people, plus a few retirees, off the payroll,out of one-half million. The entire force, which struck terror into the heartof a nation for three generations, could be re-assembled overnight underall-republic or Russian command. The crushing cost remains while the nationpleads for handouts.;   And what of the stukachi, the vast network ofinformers spying on neighbors? &quot;Nothing will happen to them. They were free tocooperate; now they are free not to cooperate.&quot;;   The Soviet KGB chief is agreat improvement over his predecessor, and may run his agency less ruthlesslythan Yeltsin's new Russian internal security. But likable Vadim Bakatin is atrue Gorbachevite: bobbing, weaving, talking reform, trying to preserve thesystem for another day by pouring the same amount of old poison into ahalf-dozen new bottles.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  WILLIAM SAFIRE  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911112  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  745  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, November 12, 199100317066,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
