Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy involving analliance of American mobsters and the Cuban government, according toa prime-time TV special Wednesday night hosted by investigativecolumnist Jack Anderson.   ``There was a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy and for thelast 25 years there has been a conspiracy to cover it up,'' Andersonsaid on the live two-hour program that featured old film footage,live interviews and ``dramatic re-enactments.''   The syndicated program, ``American Expose: Who Murdered JFK,''was based largely on previously disclosed theories and reportslinking the Nov. 22, 1963, slaying with the American mob and Cubangovernment.   In the 25 years since the assassination, scores of books,articles and TV programs have produced a wide range of conspiracytheories that point the finger alternately at organized crime, theCIA and Cuba.   The Warren Commission, appointed by Lyndon Johnson after theassassination, concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in theslaying. The House Select Committee on Assassinations laterconcluded that Kennedy probably was the victim of a conspiracy andthat there was a second gunman who fired at Kennedy.   Anderson's theory is based on interviews he conducted with JohnnyRoselli, a Las Vegas crime boss and top lieutenant to the lateChicago mob chieftain Sam Giancana.   Roselli, who was cooperating with a Senate investigators when hewas killed in 1976, told Anderson and others that he learned of thealleged conspiracy through mob sources.   Anderson believes Cuban leader Fidel Castro wanted to killKennedy after learning of alleged CIA plots to kill Castro. And LaCosa Nostra leaders in the United States wanted the president deadbecause of his administration's crusade against the mob led by hisbrother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.   Anderson said reputed Miami mob chief Santos Trafficante, allegedNew Orleans mob boss Carlos Marcello and Teamsters chief Jimmy Hoffaall had ``motive and means to kill the president.''   And he reiterated reports linking both Oswald and his assassin,Jack Ruby, to organized crime. Oswald, a pro-Castro activist, wasrecruited by Cuba to kill JFK and Ruby was recruited by mobsters tokill Oswald, according to Anderson. The columnist also asserted thatRuby and Oswald met in the weeks prior to the assassination.   The program also presented a private company's computerenhancement of photographs of Kennedy, concluding that the shot thatkilled him was fired from the front. Oswald was positioned behindthe presidential motorcade in a sixth floor room of the nearby TexasSchool Book Depository.   In a bizarre allegation, Anderson said the same photo analystsalso concluded that a picture of three hobos near the shooting scenetaken shortly after the killing appear to show Watergate conspiratorE. Howard Hunt and James Earl Ray, the killer of Martin Luther KingJr. Hunt denied that charge on the show. Anderson gave noexplanation of their alleged connection.   The program also featured live interviews with Marina OswaldPorter, Oswald's who testified before the Warren Commission. Shesaid she felt manipulated by the commission ``to make Lee a guiltyparty. ... I was very young and immature and naive.''   Anderson also charged that Johnson covered up the conspircy,fearing public disclosure of the alleged CIA plots to kill Castrowould provoke a world war with the Soviet Union. He provided noevidence to back up that claim.</TEXT></DOC>
