This revision was prepared by the New Jersey StateDepartment of Environmental Protection pursuant to a SIP commitment toreduce ozone levels in the State of New Jersey, as required under Section110 and Part D of the Clean Air Act. Today's notice proposes to incorporateinto the New Jersey SIP a revised regulation, New Jersey AdministrativeCode 7:27, Subchapter 16 ``Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution byVolatile Organic Substances,'' which will reduce violatile organic compoundemissions resulting from the refueling of motor vehicles at certain gasolinestations in the State of New Jersey.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>COMMENTS: </T2>Comments must be received by September 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>All comments should be addressed to:<ITAG tagnum="15">William J.

These measures would provide additionalVOC emission reductions needed to attain the National Ambient Air QualityStandard (NAAQS) for ozone. One of these control measures is ``Stage IIVapor Controls,'' the subject of this notice. Whenever gasoline is transferred or stored, gasoline vapors can be releasedto the atmosphere. The collection and control of these fugitive gasolinevapors at storage facilities, terminals, and the loading of gasoline servicestation tanks is called Stage I vapor controls. Because emissions due tothis bulk loading and unloading of gasoline are controlled at every pointduring its shipment (i.e., from storage and loading facilities to the tanktruck, and from the tank truck to the service station storage tank), thecontrol of the emissions due to the refueling of vehicles at gasoline servicestations is the remaining uncontrolled link in the fuel distribution system.<ITAG tagnum="84">State Submittals </ITAG>On February 22, 1988, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection(NJDEP) submitted to EPA adopted revisions to Chapter 27, Title 7 of theNew Jersey Administrative Code (N.J.A.C. 7:27) Subchapter 16 ``Controland Prohibition of Air Pollution by Volatile Organic Substances'' (Subchapter16), which New Jersey had adopted and made effective as of February 22,1998. On April 18, 1988 the State submitted information on test procedureswhich will be used to determine compliance with the revised provisionsof Subchapter 16. These revisions add to Subchapter 16 requirements for the control of gasolinevapors resulting form the refueling of vehicle fuel tanks at gasoline servicestations. When vehicle fuel tanks are refilled, the air inside the tankis displaced and forced out into the atmosphere. This air is heavily saturatedwith gasoline vapors which are VOCs that contribute to the ozone nonattainmentproblem. The control systems required under Subchapter 16, known as Stage II controls,are those that NJDEP determines are capable of capturing at least 95 percentof this vapor laden air before it enters the atmosphere. The vapor controlsystem must be approved by the NJDEP and must be composed of equipmentthat has been certified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Inaddition, it must be designed to prevent overfilling and spillage of gasoline.Subchapter 16 applies to any existing gasoline service station whose averagemonthly throughput, between September 1, 1986 and August 31, 1987, exceeds10,000 gallons. It also applies to all new stations regardless of gasolinethroughput. Each station owner must maintain records of the gasoline throughput.For each station required to be controlled a permit to construct a StageII system must be submitted to and approved by the NJDEP. After constructionof its system, a service station must pass mandatory pressure and blockagetests. The schedule for service stations to comply with the Stage II provisionsare dependent on the stations throughput. Those stations with an averagemonthly throughput of 40,000 gallons or greater must be in compliance byDecember 30, 1988. Those stations with an average monthly throughput ofless than 40,000 gallons and exceeding 10,000 gallons must be in complianceby December 29, 1989. Stations constructed after February 21, 1988 regardlessof throughput, must be in compliance prior to dispensing gasoline. The NJDEP has identified the test methods that it will use to ensure compliancewith its Stage II requirements. Pressure and blockage tests are requiredfor all stations installing Stage II control systems and are included asconditions on the permit to contruct. Efficiency testing can be done usingthe CARB test procedure, ``Test Procedure for Determining the Efficiencyof Gasoline Vapor Recovery Systems at Service Stations.'' Section 16.10 contains a general variance provision which permits the Commissionerof the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to accept alternatecontrols when a facility is unable to comply because of technical infeasibility.Variances adopted by the State become applicable only if approved by EPAas a SIP revision. It is important to note that the State did not meet the schedule for implementingthis measure that it committed to in its 1983 SIP revision. On November17, 1987, it was ordered by the U.S. District Court, District of New Jerseyin the case of the <T3>American Lung Association, et al. v. Thomas H. Kean, Governor of NewJersey, et al., </T3>to implement Stage II. The compliance schedule containedin Section 16.3 conforms to the Court ordered schedule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding </ITAG>EPA finds that the adoption of Stage II controls in Subchapter 16 meetsNew Jersey's SIP commitment. The design of the Stage II program submittedby the State is substantially equivalent to the program committed to inthe SIP, both in nature and emission reductions. The VOC reductions associatedwith this regulation are a necessary part of New Jersey's program to attainthe ozone standards. EPA is, therefore, proposing to approve the revisionsto Subchapter 16 of the N.J.A.C. 7:27 effective February 21, 1988 as itrelates to Stage II controls. EPA further notes that experience with StageII controls in other states has shown it to be a technologically feasibleand an effective means of reducing VOC emissions. EPA is soliciting public comments on its proposed action. Comments willbe considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participatein the federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to theaddress noted at the beginning of today's notice. This notice is issued as required by section 110 of the Clean Air Act,as amended. The Administrator's decision regarding the approval of thisplan revision is based on its meeting the requirements of Section 110 ofthe Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 51. Under 5 U.S.C. Section 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.) The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Ozone.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Date: December 13, 1988.</T4></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EDITORIAL NOTE: This document was received for publication by theOffice of the Federal Register on August 17, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.
