But Republicans such as Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., arguethat the restrictions ``have long been overtaken by events.''   The fight is over Democratic-backed proposals which are beingconsidered as the House debates and votes on the annual billauthorizing the Pentagon budget.   The restriction have been added for the past three years by theHouse and while some were later dropped during the lengthycongressional budget process, several remained.   ``We're pushing these things because we need to keep thepressure on, keep pushing the White House,'' said Rep. Les Aspin,D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.   Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., said the restrictions ``are a way ofkeeping the lid on the nuclear arms race.''   On Wednesday, the House:</TEXT><TEXT>   _Voted, 252-159, to ban any tests of Star Wars anti-missiledefense systems which would violate the ``narrow'' interpretationof the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   _Voted, 240-174, for a ban on spending for any weapons thatwould violate the numerical restrictions on various types of atomicweapons that are contained in the 1979 SALT II treaty. PresidentReagan says the Soviets are violating the unratified treaty and hewon't be guided any longer by its restrictions.   The House is also likely to approve restrictions on testing ofanti-satellite weapons and ban all but the smallest U.S. nucleartests, Aspin noted. Both amendments were also approved last year.   Legislators on both sides noted that the amendments arevirtually the same as the House has considered in past debates overthe Pentagon bill.   ``President Reagan is committed to arms control and he hasproved it, convincingly, and everybody has to acknowledge that,''said Broomfield.   He referred to the treaty signed by Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev Dec. 8 which eliminates medium-range nuclearmissiles, and to negotiations aimed at achieving a morefar-reaching pact calling for deep reductions in long-range atomicweapons.   Referring to Democratic critics of Reagan, Broomfield said:``Many of these true believers have been unable to recognize thesenew realities...Some of these amendments are three years old. It'stime to put them out of their misery.''   But Aspin noted that ``the House is a partisan body and thereare a lot of people here who feel very strongly about theseissues.''   He suggested that the restrictions have had an impact. ``Forexample, I think we would have violated the SALT II limits by muchmore than we have without the pressure from Congress.''   Reagan said 18 months ago that the United States would no longerbe restricted by the SALT II limits.   The restrictions were tacked onto a bill authorizing $299.5billion in Pentagon spending for the fiscal year that begins Oct 1.The total is about the same as this year's defense budget and itresulted from last December's ``budget summit'' between Reagan andCongress which was designed to lower the federal budget deficit.   The bill that passes the House will have to be reconciled withthe separate measure which will be passed by the Senate. Thatchamber is moving more slowly on the Pentagon budget, which is nowbeing written by the Senate Armed Services Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
