Glen N. Mauldin, who was administrative assistant to former Sen. Chic Hecht, was charged with 19 counts ranging from conspiracy to bribery for his alleged role in the scheme, which assertedly included setting up meetings with Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall.    Also charged with multiple felonies was Darrell A. Tomblin, a Houston businessman, and Vincent P. Lachelli, a Washington lobbyist. In a related indictment, New Orleans financial consultant William Murray Abroms was charged with five counts of perjury for allegedly lying to the grand jury investigating the matter.    As outlined in the main indictment, the plot began in 1987 when Mr. Tomblin and others &quot;devised a plan to acquire approximately 10 savings-and-loan institutions located throughout the U.S.&quot;    According to the indictment, Mr. Tomblin and others who weren't identified persuaded Mr. Mauldin to accept a secret, 10% interest in the thrifts in exchange for using his influence to help them. Specifically, the group wanted to acquire thrifts &quot;in poor economic condition without having competition or to submit competitive bids,&quot; according to the charges.    One alleged target was Suburban Savings andamp; Loan of San Antonio. According to the indictment, the defendants attempted to pressure federal regulators to allow two San Antonio businessmen to acquire the thrift. As part of the pressure, the defendents allegedly sent a letter on Mr. Hecht's official Senate stationery to the Bank Board endorsing the businessmen's effort. Mr. Maudlin also allegedly contacted Bank Board staffers &quot;to monitor and influence the decision-making&quot; and arranged a meeting between Mr. Wall, the defendants, and others.    Mr. Wall couldn't be reached for comment, but a federal official involved in the investigation emphasized that he isn't suspected of wrongdoing; nor was Mr. Hecht, recently appointed U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas, accused of breaking the law.    Helen Eversberg, the U.S. attorney for the western district of Texas, said in a news conference that Mr. Hecht &quot;cooperated fully&quot; with the investigation. Mr. Hecht couldn't be reached for comment.    David Botsford, an attorney for Mr. Tomblin, said he hasn't yet seen the indictment, but added: &quot;There's no question in my mind that Darrell Tomblin didn't knowingly or intentionally violate the law.&quot; An attorney for Mr. Lachelli declined to comment. Mr. Mauldin, who also served as Mr. Hecht's campaign treasurer, couldn't be reached for comment. A prosecutor said he was being held in a Washington jail overnight.    According to the indictment, the conspiracy didn't stop with sick thrifts. The defendants also endeavored to set up business operations in the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada, the indictment alleges, including &quot;the acquisition, installation, and operation of an oil refinery; the monopolization of commercial fishing operations, and the monopolization of trade in the spices grown in Grenada.&quot;    The indictment alleges that Mr. Mauldin was to have received a 10% stake in those activities, too, in exchange for using his influence over Grenadian and U.S. officials to clear the way. Among other things, Mr. Mauldin is accused of attempting to obtain federal grants from the U.S. Agriculture Department for the venture; trying to get the U.S. Navy to commit to buy oil from the business, and using Mr. Hecht's office to try to get $35 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development.    A prosecutor involved in the case said there isn't any evidence that any of these efforts, including those related to thrifts, bore fruit. But he added that the defendants were optimistic at first.    A year-long investigation into the alleged conspiracy was dubbed &quot;Operation Dundeal,&quot; the prosecutor said, because the defendants frequently reassured each other in wiretapped telephone conversations that the scheme was a &quot;done deal.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
