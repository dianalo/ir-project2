The compoundswere tested in toxicity screens to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) which was defined as the highest dose that produces no lethal effects.Limited available drug amounts precluded more refined testing. The secondscreen involved cobalt-60 gamma radiation. The agents to be tested wereinjected intraperitoneally into CD1 female Swiss mice, thirty minutesprior to irradiation with either 9.0 or 9.5 Gy. The latter value wasfound to be the radiation LD100(30) for this mouse strain. Survival wasmeasured and the degree of protection was determined. Dose-modificationfactors were determined on a limited number of agents as directed bythe COR.</TEXT></DOC>
