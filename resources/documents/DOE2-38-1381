This factor produces the main effect on the method accuracy(100-400%), the other factors analysed in combination make an error intemperature at the level of 50%. Method of plasma electron distributionfunction reconstruction by continuous x-radiation spectrum, based onthe correctness (under certain limitations for the required function)of the equation, linking the electron distribution function with bremmsstrahlungspectral density is presented. 11 refs.; 3 figs.; 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
