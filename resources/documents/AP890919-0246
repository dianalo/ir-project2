Meanwhile, United pilots, who are spearheading the takeovereffort, demonstrated their good faith by flying the airline's newBoeing 747-400 jets, something they had refused to do since June dueto a labor dispute.   Quoting an unidentifed adviser to the buyout group, the ChicagoSun-Times said the 10 percent pay cut would apply to managers andmost other salaried workers.   The lowest-paid clerical workers would not be affected, nor wouldemployees in one or two fields requiring highly specialized skillsand training, since those workers could easily find comparable jobswith other airlines, the newspaper said.   UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins declined to comment on the report.   Hank Krakowski, a spokesman for the United chapter of the AirLine Pilots Association, said he could not confirm the story.   ``That's between UAL management and those workers,'' Krakowskisaid. ``We don't have any say about how that's going to come down.''   The pilots' union revealed last week that United's 7,000 pilotswould take pay cuts of up to 10 percent as part of the $300-a-sharebuyout plan accepted last Thursday by UAL's board of directors.   The plan calls for UAL workers to own 75 percent of the companywith management owning 10 percent and British Airways PLC 15percent. UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and John C. Pope, UAL's chieffinancial officer, would continue to run the company for the newemployee-owners.   Leaders of the United chapter of the Association of FlightAttendants were meeting in Denver to discuss management-proposedcontract concessions that would enable them to participate inownership of the nation's second-largest airline.   United's largest union, the International Association ofMachinists and Aerospace Workers, opposed the buyout.   United's pilots, the only worker group committed so far to thebuyout plan, began flying the airline's new fuel-efficient 747-400son Monday with nonstop service from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia.   The pilots had refused to fly the long-range aircraft, whichbegan arriving in June, because of a dispute over staffingrequirements.   The pilots, who have been without a contract for 17 months, hadagreed to begin flying the jets if UAL's board accepted their buyoutbid. The agreement calls for two pilots on flights of up to eighthours, three on flights of more than eight hours and four on flightsof more than 12 hours, Krakowski said.   The pilots will implement another term of the agreement inNovember when their maximum workload goes to 85 flight hours a monthfrom 81 with no increase in pay, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
