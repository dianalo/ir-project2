On the basis of informations obtained in the present stage,recognition of actual conditions of new materials and their effects tovarious industries and demand and supply of energy are described. Generaldescriptions are as follows. (1) General description of new materialsin each country. (2) Prediction per types and market, scale of new rawmaterials. (3) Prediction on new materials for automobile industry whichis the most important industry of Japan having the largest energy consumption.(4) Concrete prediction on characteristics, demand construction and trend,and energy consumption and effect to other materials, etc. of carbonfiber, plastics, and fine ceramics, and especially on effect of ceramicengine on energy. (5) Forecast on applicable fields and market scaleof biotechnology which is closely related with energy consumption althoughunrelated with new materials, and especially on a bioreactor.
