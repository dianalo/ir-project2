The United States refused to use its veto power to protectIsrael, and abstained. The resolution passed 14-0.   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, a former ambassador toIsrael, said deportations are unhelpful and provoke Arab-Israelitension in the region.   ``The United States continues to feel very strongly aboutdeportations,'' Pickering said after leaving the council chamber.   ``It's a view that we've expressed many times to the governmentof Israel and it's a view that we expressed in our statement todaywhen we abstained on the vote.''   On Sunday, Israel deported five Arabs from the West Bank, sendingfour to Lebanon and one to France.   In July, the council passed a similar resolution using milderlanguage, saying it ``deeply regrets'' such expulsions. Thatresolution also passed 14-0, with America abstaining.   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein said ``wordings are notimportant. What is important is that at a time when carnage is goingon in Lebanon and murders are going on in the (occupied) territories... the Security Council meets here for this nonsense and is veryquick to act.''   He added that ``what is disturbing is that it looks like theUnited States is giving in.''   Wednesday's resolution ``deplores the continuing deportation byIsrael, the occupying power, of Palestinian civilians.'' It asksIsrael to return those expelled and halt the policy.   It also asks Israel to abide by the Geneva Convention thatprotects the rights of civilians in zones under military occupation.   Bein castigated the Palestine Liberation Organization forinstigating the 20-month-old insurrection. He said Israel is thefocus of one-sided Security Council criticism.   Palestinians on Dec. 8, 1987, began their uprising againstIsraeli rule in lands occupied in the 1967 Middle East war, oftenstoning soldiers and Israeli settlers. At least 554 Palestinianshave been killed in clashes with soldiers or Israeli civilians sincethen. Thirty-eight Israelis also have been killed.</TEXT></DOC>
