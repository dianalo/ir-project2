The records, unsealed by a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., provide the first official indication that investigators in the Pentagon fraud inquiry are looking into whether some lawmakers benefited from improper political support in exchange for backing certain weapons programs.    However, the court records, parts of which were deleted under a court order, don't identify any lawmakers or specific programs they backed.    The documents covered government searches last month of Unisys Corp. offices in Great Neck, N.Y.; Hazeltine Corp. in Greenlawn, N.Y.; Kane Paper Co. in Baldwin, N.Y.; and the home of Charles Gardner, a former Unisys vice president who later worked for the company as a consultant. Unisys and Hazeltine both produce electronic systems for the military. James Kane, president of the Kane Paper, is an associate of Mr. Gardner and the founder of a political action committee set up to solicit campaign contributions from employees of Long Island defense contractors.    The documents, search warrants and lists of materials that were collected at each location suggest the grand jury investigation is a broad one. In addition to seeking documents, computer files, and correspondence, federal agents even rummaged through trash bins, and they took away at least one file of photographs.    The court documents show the government suspects that individuals targeted by the investigation sought to influence lawmakers through gifts or improper payments. For example, a search warrant for Kane Paper asked for material &quot;pertaining to schemes&quot; to &quot;extort campaign contributions&quot; from certain companies that weren't named in the documents released.    The Kane Paper search warrant also sought calendars, diaries and other documents &quot;reflecting the ownership, leasing or use of real property&quot; by federal officials. And it says agents sought documents &quot;relating to the ownership of stock certificates&quot; or other &quot;things of value&quot; that may have been given to public officials by Mr. Gardner, Kane Paper, or Dennis Mitchell, a Unisys official who worked with Mr. Gardner. It defined the suspected recipients as federal officials &quot;involved in the authorization and/or appropriation of defense contracts.&quot; One law enforcement official said that phrase was intended to cover both lawmakers and Defense Department personnel.    Moreover, among the materials seized from Kane was a &quot;political file&quot; dealing with &quot;luncheons, parties, etc. for politicians.&quot; In addition, federal agents took away from Kane a file entitled &quot;Sperry and Congressman . . .&quot; The name was deleted from the released documents. Sperry was absorbed into Unisys in 1986.    The court documents reinforce earlier indications that proprietary information may have traveled from one contractor to another, possibly through a network of defense consultants who had multiple clients. A list of materials seized at Hazeltine's offices, for example, included files labeled &quot;project reports-Unisys&quot; and &quot;activity reports-Unisys.&quot;    In addition, one of the search warrants sought from Hazeltine a copy of the government's &quot;acquisition plan on the MRC139,&quot; a Navy radio set. It also sought &quot;copies of other documents containing information which should not have been released from the government.&quot;    The agents also sought from Hazeltine agreements the company entered with two consultants previously identified as central figures in investigations -- Thomas Muldoon and William Parkin.    The search warrants for Messrs. Mitchell and Gardner both sought information &quot;pertaining to schemes to defraud Unisys by diverting monies to individuals and business entities to illegally influence the defense contracting process.&quot;    Yesterday's release of documents could break the logjam that's kept hundreds of pages of government affidavits and other documents under seal. A federal judge in Los Angeles may release additional documents as early as today, and law enforcement officials said other judges are likely to follow suit.    Unisys has said it has placed six employees on leave while the investigation continues and tightened its controls over consultants. It also has said some of its employees may have violated the company's own ethics rules.    Mr. Mitchell couldn't be reached for comment. Attorneys for Messrs. Muldoon and Gardner have declined to discuss the investigation, and Mr. Parkin has declined to comment. Kane Paper hasn't commented, and Mr. Kane couldn't be reached. Hazeltine also couldn't be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
