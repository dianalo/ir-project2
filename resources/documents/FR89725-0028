The authorityfor the issuance was the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C.A.app. 2401-2420), as amended (``the Act''), and the Export AdministrationRegulations (``the Regulations'').\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Act was reauthorized and amended by the Export AdministrationAmendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-64, 99 Stat. 120 (July 12, 1985), andamended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-418,102 Stat. 1107 (August 23, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28">The Regulations, formerly codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399, were redesignatedas 15 CFR Parts 768-799, effective October 1, 1988 (53 FR 37751, September28, 1988). </ITAG>After Respondent filed his appeal, the Office of the Assistant Secretaryfor Export Enforcement submitted a copy of the record on the basis of whichthe Assistant Secretary decided to issue the Temporary Denial Order, andthe Agency filed a reply to Respondent's appeal. This Report and Recommendationon the appeal is issued on the tenth working day after the June 27, 1989filing of Respondent's appeal, in accord with the time schedule prescribedfor resolving the appeal by section 13(d)(2) of the Act (50 U.S.C. app.2412(d)(2)) and Section 788.19(e)(4) of the Regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>The Temporary Denial Order denied for 180 days the U.S. export privilegesof Respondent and three other named individuals and the companies throughwhich they do business. According to the Temporary Denial Order, the Agencyhad reason to believe that, from a date unknown to December 9, 1988 theseindividuals tried to export equipment from the United States to Bulgariaknowing that such equipment was unlikely to be authorized by the Departmentfor such export, and that on December 9, 1989 they actually attempted suchan export by falsely declaring that the export destination was The Netherlandsand that the equipment was general license G-DEST. Further according to the Temporary Denial Order, each of the four individualshad been indicted in a U.S. District Court in Massachusetts for his rolein this unlawful export activity, and the Agency had reason to believealso that they had access to large sums of money that would be used, andalso to Belgian contacts that would if necessary be used, to attempt suchunlawful exports to Bulgaria in the future. Based on this showing by theAgency, the Temporary Denial Order stated that its issuance was necessaryin the public interest to prevent an imminent violation of the Act andthe Regulations. The essence of Respondent's appeal of the Temporary Denial Order was ``thathe is in no way involved in any business of the  * * * [other individuals]mentioned in [the Temporary Denial Order]'' (Appeal 1). ``His connectionwith said persons is limited to being private chauffeur of * * * [one ofthem] and handcarrying several cheques for * * * [the other two]'' (<T3>id.</T3>). The Agency's reply supplied a copy of the indictment mentioned in the TemporaryDenial Order; and the Agency's reply added that two of the four individualsnamed therein (not Respondent) had been arrested, and that one of thesetwo has pled guilty to the charges. The Agency's evidence of Respondent'sactivities was chiefly an affidavit of a U.S. Customs Special Agent thatreported on the debriefing of the arrested individual who has pled guilty.According to this affidavit, this individual said that Respondent was presentat meetings where the export activity at issue was discussed, that he deliveredto one of the four individuals checks written by another of the four inpayment for the equipment, that when one of the four was hospitalized Respondentacted as his liaison with the export activity and updated him every twodays, and that Respondent was to receive $10,000 for his efforts. As to possible future unlawful exports, in this debriefing this arrestedindividual reportedly spoke also of another of the four indicted individuals.This individual was said to have a large sum of money dedicated to acquiringmore such equipment for export to Bulgaria, and also to have previouslybribed Belgian customs officials to allow exports to be unlawfully divertedto Bulgaria, and to have claimed. that he would utilize these same officialsfor exporting this new equipment to Bulgaria if necessary. The Agency suggestedadditionally that three of the four indicted individuals are at large (theone who was arrested and pled guilty is now out on bail pending sentencing),and thus these three remain free to continue their prior export activity.In view of their past activities and Respondent's role in these activities,the Agency argued that he should remain subject to the Temporary DenialOrder. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>The evidence submitted by the Agency and summarized above shows a reasonablepossibility that Respondent together with three other individuals engagedin efforts to export equipment unlawfully from the United States to Bulgaria.This evidence shows further that Respondent and these other individualsmay have the means to continue such efforts. Respondent's appeal, containingsimply a denial of his involvement in such efforts, fails to overcome theAgency's evidence. Thus the undersigned concludes that it is reasonableto believe that the Temporary Denial Order is required in the public interestto prevent an imminent violation of the Act and the Regulations. Consequently the Recommendation of the undersigned is that Respondent'sappeal be denied and that the Temporary Denial Order be affirmed. ThisReport and Recommendation shall constitute the final resolution of thisappeal if and when the Recommendation is accepted by the Secretary pursuantto andSection; 788.19(e)(5) of the Regulations. <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 12, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas W.
