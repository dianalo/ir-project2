Legislators had earlier been shocked by the announcementTuesday night that Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov hadsuffered a heart attack. Moscow Radio said late Wednesdaythat Mr. Ryzhkov's condition was worsening.</LP><TEXT>   In his surprise selection of Mr. Yanayev, the 53-year-oldsecretary of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee andhead of the Communists' faction in the Congress of People'sDeputies, Mr. Gorbachev dashed expectations that his choicewould be calculated to smooth over at least some of thenation's complex problems, such as national separatism,economic reform, and political restructuring.   Instead, Mr. Yanayev provides a conservative voice on allthree counts. As a Russian, he fails to answer hopes that Mr.Gorbachev would select a leader of an independence-mindedrepublic to help build a nation of equal and sovereign memberrepublics. As a clear opponent of radical economic reform,Mr. Yanayev is unlikely to add new energy to the hesitantdrive toward a market economy. And as a longtime Communistbureaucrat, he does little to help promote the nation'sfledgling multiparty system or the separation of governmentand party that Mr. Gorbachev has said he supports.   &quot;I am a convinced Communist to the depths of my soul,&quot; Mr.Yanayev told the Congress. &quot;My main fight will be againstpolitical Bacchanalia and vandalism, but by using democraticmeans, not by repression.&quot;   The Congress must confirm Mr. Yanayev's appointment andthe result of the vote may not be declared until thismorning. Many delegates said they have no doubt he would beapproved, as have all significant proposals by PresidentGorbachev at the Congress so far.   Mr. Gorbachev defended his choice with irritation againsta series of charged questions from the floor. &quot;He is a man ofstrong principles, an active supporter of perestroika,&quot; Mr.Gorbachev said. Names that had been circulated as possiblecandidates for vice president included such reformers asKazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Leningrad MayorAnatoli Sobchak and Eduard Shevardnadze, the exiting foreignminister whom Mr. Gorbachev had earlier said he intended toappoint.   Asked how he explained the apparent gap between theexperience and philosophies of Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr.Yanayev, Mr. Gorbachev argued that the two had a lot incommon. Both are hard workers, he said, with longinternational experience. Mr. Yanayev has served on theparty's international committee, for years pursuing contactsprimarily with Socialist-bloc countries.   But critics said Mr. Gorbachev's choice simply showed hisown real conservatism. &quot;As long as {Mr. Yanayev} believes theSoviet Union should be saved as the Russian empire and thatsocialism can work, he's a conservative to me,&quot; said AlgisChekuolis, a Lithuanian legislator who is attending theCongress as an observer because his republic is officiallyboycotting its deliberations.   Many deputies felt Mr. Gorbachev's main goal was to picksomeone who would be a solid ally, ready to accept andsupport any ideas the president puts forth, and that Mr.Yanayev filled that bill.   The selection of vice president was Mr. Gorbachev's firstpersonnel appointment in a new government structure andsystem of executive power that the Congress approvedWednesday morning. Attention is now focused on who will beselected to fill other key posts such as foreign minister andprime minister.   Mr. Shevardnadze stunned the Congress last week when heresigned as foreign minister, warning that the newpresidential powers could lead ultimately to a legaldictatorship.   As for the post of prime minister, few deputies expect Mr.Ryzhkov, who has been under attack for months for hisconservative economic policies, to return to an activepolitical position following his heart attack. Even before hewas hospitalized it was widely expected that he would bereplaced as premier after five years in the post.   Although the role of vice president under the newstructure won't supercede that of prime minsiter, in hiscomments Wednesday, Mr. Yanayev appeared to be an ideologicalbrother to Mr. Ryzhkov.   Mr. Yanayev, who worked his way up through the officiallabor union and the Communist youth organization, said he wascommitted to pursuing perestroika, of which an importantelement will be social welfare protection for workers. &quot;If wetake the shock approach to economic reform, more than amillion people will be unemployed,&quot; Mr. Yanayev tolddeputies.   Under the new government structure, it isn't clear yetwhat role the new vice president will play. He will, however,sit as a member of the revised Federation Council, anorganization made up of leaders of republics and otherregions that is supposed to determine national andinternational policy and oversee its implementation in therepublics.</TEXT></DOC>
