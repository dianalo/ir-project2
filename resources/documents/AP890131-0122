(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush pledged Tuesday to ``wring thelast drop of waste and mismanagement'' out of the scandal-scarredmilitary procurement system and said that cost overruns hurt thenational security.   Standing on the sun-splashed deck of the aircraft carrierAmerica, Bush delivered his message in a speech to thousands ofsailors at the Norfolk Naval Base and Air Station, the largest navalinstallation in the country. A number of representatives of defensecontractors also were in the audience.   Still fighting off a cold, Bush had a raspy voice and coughedrepeatedly during his remarks. He said later he had been ``justcroaking away'' and wasn't sure during his speech that he would beable to finish.   It was his first out-of-town trip since becoming president, andhis speech came against the backdrop of a fraud and bribery scandalin the military procurement system.   Bush said he believed that the overwhelming majority ofprocurement officers and defense contractors care about the qualityof the ships, planes and weapons that they sell to the Pentagon. ``Iam determined to make sure that every single one of them does,'' hesaid.   The president said that cost overruns are not a new problem but``they are still wrong and hurt the national security, particularlywhen budgets are tight.   ``We want tighter controls and higher standards in weaponsprocurement, and we will get tighter controls and higher standardsin weapons procurement,'' he said.   Saying he will insure that the military has the proper supportfrom the country, Bush said, ``I firmly believe that the vital firststep to broadening our national consensus on defense is to wring thelast drop of waste and mismanagement out of the way we buy ourweapons. And that's what we intend to do.''   Bush flew by helicopter from Washington and landed directly onthe deck of the carrier. A staff helicopter that landed first sent agust of wind across the deck that nearly blew away the red carpettaped down for the president. It was rolled up and then laid outagain once Bush landed.   As part of security precautions, Bush's armored limousine was puton the ship's deck. It rode alongside him as he walked.   Bush did not wear an overcoat in the mild weather _ thetemperature was in the 50s _ although the sailors and many membersof the audience wore jackets and coats to ward off the chill of thewind. Bush, who came down with a cold late last week, said he wasfeeling better.   Despite his cold, Bush seemed in good spirits. After his remarks,he ate lunch in a mess hall with enlisted sailors, dining on eggdrop soup, Cantonese meat sticks, pork-fried rice, a spring roll,shrimp and a glass of milk.   He asked if the chow was ``show business food'' or if the sailorsalways ate as well. They said they generally ate pretty well.   ``You want a little Trivial Pursuit?'' he asked a sailor. He saidhe had been stationed at nearby Oceana Naval Air Station ``athousand years ago'' as World War II was coming to an end.   ``I had just gotten orders to go back overseas,'' he recalled.``Thank God, the war ended.''   Introducing Bush to the audience, Vice Adm. Richard Dunleavy, theair commander of the Atlantic Fleet, told Bush ``you're back to yourroots'' and proclaimed a homecoming.   Bush was a naval combat fighter in World War II and recalled someof his experiences.   Saying he would demand high standards from defense contractors,Bush said, ``I've been inside a submerged submarine while depthcharges were going off all around it. And I know what it's like tohear the vessel strain and shake and pray to God that the people incharge of buying and building cared as much about the vessel as youdo.''   Bush spent weeks aboard a submarine during the war after he wasrescued as sea when his plane was shot down.</TEXT></DOC>
