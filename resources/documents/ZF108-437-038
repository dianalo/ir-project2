Scott.andM;The PC hasn't helped any.andP;  When the first simulators appeared, they were, ofcourse, flight simulators--since landing on the deck of an aircraft carrierwas supposed to be a whole lot more exciting than spinning around in aturret.andP;  A handful of tank games appeared on store shelves, but frankly, thebest thing that could be said about them was that they came in pretty boxes.andM;Well, that's all changed now.andP;  The people at Microprose have created M1 TankPlatoon, the best of several excellent new tank simulations.andP;  This is a gameso realistic, it wouldn't be too surprising if a whole army of armchairwarriors started breaking out the K-rations after engaging in their firstbattle.andM;Designed to re-create all the ins and outs of armored land combat, M1 TankPlatoon gives you full control of four M1 tanks--the state-of-the-art AFV(armored fighting vehicle, that is).andP;  The program also gives you a lot ofleeway as to just how youandM;control your tanks.andP;   You canandM;maneuver them from the highly detailed mapboard, which like most standard wargames, features counters to represent tanks, supporting units, and aircraft.andO;You can give orders to the platoon as a whole or you can direct individualvehicles.andM;You can also leave the mapboard and hop into any one of your tanks.andP;  Afterall, the real action lies face to face with the enemy at the front line ofcombat.andP;  Each M1 has four crewman: the driver, the gunner, the loader, andthe tank commander.andP;  With the exception of the loader (the lowest-rankingcrewmember, whose job it is to load shells into the tank's big 120 mm gun),you can &quot;relieve&quot; any of these soldiers, in effect taking over his position.andO;You can also switch from tank to tank.andM;In addition to your platoon of tanks, the game lets you control--but notoperate--various supporting elements, including artillery, antiaircraft guns,armored personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, M60 tanks,helicopters, and the A-10A Attack Jet.andP;  Just as in real combat, there arelimitations to these units.andP;  For example, aircraft can be shot down and won'tfly in bad weather.andP;  Artillery can fire on your own positions if you're notcareful with your coordinates.andM;The game offers two training missions and options to play out single battlesor an entire compaign.andP;  Players who opt for the single battle mode can alsochoose a specific type of clash.andP;  There are six engagements in all, rangingfrom Blitzkrieg (an all-out offensive) to Rearguard (a last-ditch,last-one-out of-the-fort-shut-off-the-lights defense).andP;  Platoons (or what'sleft of them) can be saved from battle to battle, and the computer keepstrack of the crews' performance and decorations.andM;M1 Tank Platoon provides plenty of authenticity.andP;  Before a battle, thebattalion intelligence officer offers a briefing, including a weather reportand a summary of Soviet forces.andP;  If your scout helicopters aren't flying, youwon't spot an enemy unit on the map until you have visual contact on thebattlefield.andM;An &quot;outside&quot; view allows you to dismount the tank and watch the action aroundyou.andP;  Tanks can assume &quot;hull down&quot; positions on hills (exposing only theheavily armored turret to enemy fire) and form actual military formations.andO;M1's reality is sometimes grim: when a crewman is hit, you cannot access hisposition.andM;An outstanding manual (which weighs in at a full pound) not only walks youthrough the training missions and crew positions, but also reads like a WestPoint text on armored combat tactics.andP;  Yet it takes a complex game and makesit playable in a surprisingly short time.andM;Finally, the game does suffer from Microprose's rather paranoidcopy-protection scheme in which you need to do everything but phone in yoursocial security number before you get to play.andP;  There's a keyboard overlay, akey disk, and a vehicle identification test.andP;  Advice to Microprose: keep theoverlay, even the key disk, but lose the test.andM;Still, this is a minor complaint.andP;  M1 Tank Platoon is great entertainment,and it is to be hoped that Microprose will continue to refine the software (ala Flight Simulator).andP;  The manual states that &quot;no political statement isintenaed&quot; and that &quot;Russians and East Europeans are pretty nice people.&quot;andP;  Inother words, this is just a game that simulates a conventional war.andO;Hopefully, we'll never find out just how accurate a game it is.andM;List Price: M1 Tank Platoon, $69.95.andP;  Requires: 512K RAM, graphics adapter,DOS 2.0 or later.andP;  Joystick recommended.andP;  Copy-protected through key disk.andO;Microprose Simulation Software, 180 Lakefront Dr., Hunt Valley, MD 21030;(301) 771-6717.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
