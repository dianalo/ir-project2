Officials of the Midwest Stock Exchange say they are ready to start trading 25 over-the-counter stocks May 18 if the Securities and Exchange Commission accepts an SEC staff recommendation and grants approval today.    The move would be the first major attempt at blending the so-called auction and dealer markets for securities. But industry and regulatory officials say it's difficult to predict whether the exchange will draw enough business to make a difference to investors and institutions trading over-the-counter issues.    Over-the-counter stocks are traded through a network of dealers or market makers, while exchanges use specialists who make markets in an auction format. As with OTC market makers, stock quotes from Midwest exchange specialists would be included in calculating bid and offer prices displayed by the National Association of Securities Dealers' automated quotation system.    Stocks chosen by the Midwest exchange for the trial program, which is expected to last a year or more, include Apple Computer Inc. and MCI Communications Corp., as well as such lesser-known names as Battle Mountain Gold Co. and Price Co.    For the Midwest and other exchanges that might follow, the program is a first attempt at capturing business in the rapidly growing over-the-counter market. Success in the pilot program could mean expanding the number of OTC issues traded by exchanges on an unlisted basis.    A pivotal question is whether the presence of the Midwest's specialists will narrow the spread between bid and offer prices of the OTC issues.    &quot;Obviously, the Midwest exchange hopes its trading facilities and its expertise will attract better order flow by making better, deeper, more liquid markets,&quot; Brandon Becker, associate director of the SEC's division of market regulation, said. &quot;If that happens, presumably investors would see better, tighter markets.&quot;    Although increased competition could squeeze profits of other market makers, Charles V. Doherty, president of the Midwest exchange, said it could ultimately be good for both customers and brokers.    &quot;Lower transaction costs mean more transactions and more profit for everyone,&quot; he said in an interview.    While some money managers say they're ready to give the Midwest program a try, others, and some OTC traders, express doubt that an additional market maker will have a big impact on the already stiff competition in trading the 25 stocks.    &quot;It's just going to be another competitor in the (price-quote) machine, and we welcome the challenge,&quot; Robert O'Toole, executive vice president and manager of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York, said.    Frank J. Wilson, executive vice president and general counsel of the National Association of Securities Dealers, said over-the-counter traders' forecasts of the Midwest's share of trading volume in the stocks ranges from &quot;nil to 10%.&quot;    Still, the specialists' practice of quoting the size and price of public orders may force market makers to be more competitive. In displaying their bid and offer prices, OTC market makers typically indicate that the prices are valid only for the first 100 shares traded. The price of shares above that total becomes negotiable.    Mr. Wilson says market makers intend to &quot;compete aggressively&quot; with the Midwest specialists, in part by a willingness to trade larger numbers of shares at a specific price.    &quot;If the exchange has 2,000 orders up, we expect OTC market makers will be putting up equal or greater numbers of shares,&quot; he said.    Separately, the SEC also is expected to decide today whether to ask Congress for explicit authority to regulate brokerage activities of commercial banks. Such a request has been expected since November, when a federal appeals court ruled that the SEC lacked authority to require banks to register as broker-dealers. The court also urged Congress to make a comprehensive review of U.S. securities laws, such as the Glass-Steagall Act, which separates the banking and securities industries. </TEXT></DOC>
