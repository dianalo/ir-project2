Lawyers representing former national security adviser John M.Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and businessman Albert Hakimcontended that some of the evidence prosecutors used to obtain the23-count indictment last month came from testimony the three gaveto the House and Senate Iran-Contra committees.   Poindexter, North and Hakim testified under grants of limited or``use'' immunity from prosecution that prohibits independentcounsel Lawrence E. Walsh from using their answers to congressionalquestioning as evidence against them.   Even though Walsh tried to insulate his staff and grand jurorsfrom publicity surrounding the hearings, ``given the widespreaddissemination of immunized testimony throughout our society, thebroad use of immunized testimony has been inevitable, undeniableand so pervasive that the indictment must be dismissed as a matterof law,'' the defense lawyers said.   They asked U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to hold ahearing to determine whether grand jurors, prosecutors andinvestigators on Walsh's staff relied on the immunizedcongressional testimony.   ``Never in the history of this nation has the immunizedtestimony of putative defendants been broadcast live, on all majornetworks, to tens of millions of viewers and listeners,'' said thewritten request.   The defense contended that use of that congressional testimonyor information derived from it ``has been and will be used againstthem in many ways in this prosecution, in violation of their rightsunder the Fifth Amendment.''   North, Poindexter, Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. RichardV. Secord were charged with conspiring to divert proceeds of theU.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras at a time whenCongress banned American military aid to the rebels.   Lawyers for Secord, who brokered the arms deals with Hakim andtestified on Capitol Hill without use immunity, charged in aseparate motion that Walsh illegally ignored congressionaltestimony of North and Poindexter that would vindicate their client.   ``The independent counsel's decision to exalt prosecutorialconvenience above General Secord's Fifth Amendment right to a fairand informed grand jury taints the proceedings against him andrequires, as a matter of fundamental fairness, that the indictmentbe dismissed,'' Secord's lawyers said in their brief.   Secord tried unsuccessfully earlier this year to force the grandjury to consider North and Poindexter's congressional testimony.Both men told Congress that Secord was acting as a U.S. governmentagent, a point the defense says should have been made to the grandjury before he was indicted.   Walsh is expected to respond in court pleadings on Friday. Theindependent counsel must prove that he insulated his staff andgrand jurors from the publicity surrounding the hearings.   Gesell has scheduled a hearing for next Tuesday to explore theissues sketched out in the defense brief.   Before the congressional hearings got under way last spring,Walsh rushed many witnesses through the grand jury and filedevidence he had obtained under court seal to prove it was obtainedindependently of the congressional testimony.   Among other things, the defense asked Gesell to questionindividual grand jurors to determine if they learned of theimmunized congressional testimony from friends, relatives or newsreports.   The hearing should also determine whether or not grand jurorswere exposed to immunized testimony from witnesses who testified inthe grand jury.   The defense said it planned to challenge the legal authority offormer federal judge Herbert Stern to represent Walsh's office onthe immunity issue. Stern was retained by Walsh as an outsidecounsel so that prosecutors on the independent counsel's staffwould remain insulated from the congressional testimony.   Defense lawyers contended Stern lacks legal authority torepresent the U.S. government under the disputed independentcounsel law or the Justice Department regulation that Walshreceived to counter constitutional challenges to the specialprosecutor statute.</TEXT></DOC>
