Yeltsin completed a stunning politicalcomeback with his landslide victory over a candidate who symbolizedpower and prestige.

Scientists and nearby residents held news conferences at thestate Capitol and a vigil was planned outside the plant late Mondayand for 4 a.m. Tuesday, the time the accident began.   ``The so-called accident at TMI was an act of violence againtmankind, an act of violence against the unborn,'' said Jane Lee, anactivist from nearby Etters, referring to the March 28, 1979,incident.

The central bank, facing growing political pressure over fearsof a possible recession, is likely to postpone further credittightening for the time being at a meeting this week, manyeconomists believe, although they expect this respite will be brief.

So far this year, inflation at the wholesale level has beenracing ahead at an alarming annual rate of 12.6 percent, andconsumer prices have been rising at a slower, but stilltroublesome, annual rate of 6.1 percent, up sharply from the 4.4percent increase in consumer prices turned in during the past twoyears.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The improving U.S. trade deficit, the biggestfactor promoting domestic growth last year, is on the verge ofstalling out unless the Bush administration moves quickly todevalue the dollar and reach a budget agreement with Congress, aresearch institute warned Monday.   The Institute for International Economics said that unless theUnited States is able to get its trade problems under control, thecountry faces the threat of a recession, triggered by the flight offoreigners from U.S. investments.   There is also a danger that rising trade deficit would forceCongress and the administration to erect protectionist tradebarriers that would threaten a global trade war, according to thestudy, ``American Trade Adjustment: the Global Impact.''   The report said without needed policy changes, America's tradedeficit will begin rising again in 1990 and by 1992 will surpassthe record imbalance of $154 billion set in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
