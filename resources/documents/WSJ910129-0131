Backers of the Strategic Defense Initiative have seized onthe Patriot's performance to challenge the basic objectionsto putting a ballistic-missile defense in space. The Patriotproves that &quot;you can hit a bullet with a bullet,&quot; saysretired Lt. Gen. Daniel Graham, head of a pro-SDI groupcalled High Frontier.</LP><TEXT>   Others, however, note that the Patriot is a far cry fromthe space-based &quot;peace shield&quot; concept that Ronald Reaganembraced when he launched the SDI program.   &quot;The people who say the Patriot's success shows that SDIworks don't know what they're talking about,&quot; says formerDefense Secretary Harold Brown. Among other things, Mr. Brownnotes, the Scuds are &quot;very unsophisticated old stuff -- easyto see, relatively easy to hit,&quot; compared with the Sovietintercontinental ballistic missiles SDI is supposed tointercept. Moreover, he adds, &quot;it is clear that the Scudmissile itself cannot be attacked from space.&quot;   Iraq's attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia have sharpenedas never before anxieties about the proliferation ofmissiles, chemical weapons and nuclear warheads in the ThirdWorld -- threats that until recently hadn't seemed verycredible to most military planners.   The Patriot's field day won't exactly resurrect PresidentReagan's grand plan, but it has provided a prime-timedemonstration of the virtues of using missiles for defense.At the very least, Star Wars enthusiasts anticipate biggerbudgets for some strategic defense programs. Even Mr. Brownexpects to see more money for SDI in the next budget cyclebecause &quot;the threat from Third World missiles is now fixed ineverybody's mind.&quot;   The biggest winner is likely to be ground-based defensesystems, the underfunded stepchild of the highflying SDI. ThePentagon's SDI office is working on several anti-ballisticmissile systems designed to intercept tactical missiles, butthese projects get only one-seventh of SDI's $2.9 billionbudget.   Democratic Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, a leader in asuccessful effort last fall to add $218 million for researchand development of ground-based defense systems, believes thePatriot's performance has won over most of the skeptics inCongress. &quot;In the last week,&quot; he says, &quot;a lot of people havecome up to me and said, `You're right, it works.'&quot;   Others contend that recent events underscore theimportance of preparing immediately for the Third Worldmissile threat. They note how in less than a decade Iraqimodifications transformed the Soviet Scud-B, a primitivemissile with a range of only 180 miles, into a weapon ofterror capable of hitting cities 550 miles away.   &quot;The real threat in the next 10 to 15 years is theevolution of missiles from Scud distance to intermediateranges -- 700 to 1,000 miles -- that might threaten Europefrom the Mideast,&quot; says John Browne, associate director ofdefense research and applications at the Los Alamos NationalLaboratory. &quot;It isn't inconceivable that somebody mightlaunch an attack (on the U.S.) from a tanker in theAtlantic.&quot;   James Hackett, a former U.S. arms-control official, faultsthe military's &quot;preference for offense over defense&quot; forstalling development of so-called theater-defense missiles tocounter the Scud threat. The Patriot, made by Raytheon Co.,was the only interceptor produced during the Reagan militarybuildup, and its effectiveness against missiles was enhancedonly just in time to swat down Iraq's Scuds.   Despite its spectacular batting average so far, thePatriot clearly has limitations. It isn't an airtightdefense, as the Israelis are discovering; a Patriot batterycan only defend an airfield or a small city. And even whenPatriots knock out an incoming Scud, falling debris can causedamage and casualties.   Up to now, the SDI office has been preoccupied with its&quot;brilliant pebbles&quot; plan for scattering a horde of orbitingrockets to intercept Soviet missiles. But with the Sovietthreat much diminished, SDI officials are lowering theirsights somewhat, giving new emphasis to theater defenses. Tothat end, they are proclaiming eagerness to improve on thePatriot -- or to develop a new generation of faster,higher-flying interceptors that are capable of defending amuch larger &quot;footprint.&quot;   One idea they are pushing is a $40 billion scheme calledGPALS, shorthand for Global Protection Against LimitedStrikes. This would be a thinned-out version of brilliantpebbles, undergirded by ground-based defenses for the U.S.and augmented by mobile batteries of anti-ballistic missileinterceptors for theater defense. Interceptor candidatesinclude the Arrow, a joint U.S.-Israeli missile designed toprotect Israel, and the highly mobile Erint.   &quot;Why should we develop systems to protect people only inTel Aviv?&quot; asks SDI Director Henry Cooper. &quot;Why not New York?Why not Indianapolis? Every city in this country is inexactly the same boat as Tel Aviv. The only difference isthey are a long way away from the present threat. It's just amatter of time before the Third World has long-rangecapability.&quot;   Mr. Cooper says GPALS could ward off not only Third Worldattacks on the U.S. and its friends but also protect U.S.troops and air bases overseas and the U.S. fleet at sea. Inaddition, such a system could intercept accidental orunauthorized missile salvos as they arc out of theincreasingly turbulent Soviet Union, a matter of considerableconcern to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn(D., Ga.).   Even though it's a colossal technological leap fromdefending an airport to shielding the world, Mr. Cooperinsists GPALS, if adequately funded, could be up and hummingsoon after the year 2000. Theater defenses, in the meantime,could be deployed in five years.   But despite the Patriot's successes, he and other SDIadvocates still face a hard sell in Congress. &quot;I don't thinkthe success of the Patriot is an argument for funding ofSDI,&quot; says House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.):&quot;I hope we don't learn the wrong lessons from this war.&quot;   Many Democratic lawmakers have deep misgivings aboutdeploying space-based weapons for fear they would upset theU.S.-Soviet nuclear balance and violate the anti-ballisticmissile treaty. Others believe the risks of a Third Worldstrike at the U.S. or an accidental Soviet launch are vastlyoverdrawn.   But the biggest stumbling block remains money. Rep. JohnMurtha (D., Pa.), chairman of the House Appropriationssubcommittee on defense, says that &quot;even though people willbe enthusiastic about&quot; missile defense, he doesn't expect abig surge in research on it. &quot;The minute this (the war) isover, the money for defense is going to drop precipitously,&quot;he says.   ---   Bob Davis in Dhahran contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
