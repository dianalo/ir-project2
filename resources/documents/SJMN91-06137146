Many homeowners with plenty of space also have discovered thatflower-filled containers can carry garden themes to walks, entrance ways andpools and put favorite posies into sharper focus on a porch, deck or patio.;   Containers can be nearly anything that holds a planting mix. Depending onone's aesthetic preference, they can range from the more elegant terra-cotta,redwood and fiber glass kinds sold at garden centers to recycled bushelbaskets, upended drain tiles, an old wheelbarrow or child's wagon ortraditional clay pots -- you name it.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GROWING IN CONTAINERS EXPANDS THE FLOWERSHOW  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Good drainage is essential. Make sure each container has adequate holes atthe bottom to permit excess water to run off freely. Also, use a commercialplanting mixture such as Jiffy-Mix rather than ordinary soil dug from thegarden. These mixtures are clean, convenient to work with and free of diseasesand insects.;    Virtually all plants that grow in the garden can be grown incontainers, but many are preferred for containers because of their naturalcompactness and because they don't need the deep soil required by plants withextensive root systems. Some flower varieties have been bred specifically forcontainer culture.;    Flowers most commonly used for sunny exposures aregeraniums, dwarf marigolds and zinnias, pansies, alyssum, petunias, mums,nasturtiums, ageratum, dianthus and others favored for their bright, enduringblossoms. Among impressive trailing subjects for hanging baskets are lantanas,thunbergia and lobelias.;    Where there is some shade, impatiens, wax andtuberous begonias, coleus, torenia, salvia, browallia and fuchsia are goodchoices for color. Appropriate combinations of plants can be particularlyappealing.;    Here are additional tips from the Professional Plant GrowersAssociation:;    (box) For showier effects, plant container flowers closerthan you would in the garden.;    (box) Check water needs daily. Soil driesout faster in containers than it does in the garden. Water generously whensoil is dry to the touch and before plants begin to wilt.;    (box) Turncontainers occasionally so the sun reaches all parts for balanced growth.;   (box) Fertilize frequently with a water-soluble plant food as directed. Removespent flowers to encourage re-blooming.;    (box) Place casters under largecontainers so they can be moved conveniently.;    Observing that containergardening has become a distinct and important branch of home horticulture, JimWilson, venerable host of public television's &quot;Victory Garden South,&quot;attributes the timing partly to irony and partly to technology.;    In anintroduction in his new book, &quot;Landscaping with Container Plants&quot; (HoughtonMifflin, $35), Wilson says the irony is that &quot;just when gardening has becomeone of the most popular forms of recreation in the United States, manyAmericans are finding themselves with little or no land on which to garden.&quot;;   The solution, he suggests, is to create a landscape with container plants.Wilson's book reflects his expertise, which he shares generously with readersamid lavish color photos sure to turn purple thumbs green with envy -- andinspiration.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ART KOZELKA, Chicago Tribune  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Chicago  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910516  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  498  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 16, 199100137146,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
