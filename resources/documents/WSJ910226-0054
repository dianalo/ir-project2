Just how big could the battle become? This much is clear:Never before has such man-made destructive power beenassembled. In this battle theater, according to retired ArmyCol. Trevor Dupuy, author of the Encyclopedia of MilitaryHistory, allied firepower alone exceeds that used by any armyin history by a factor of three.</LP><TEXT>   The allied army is also the most sophisticated ever seen,supported by rockets, missiles, aircraft with &quot;smart&quot; bombs,60-ton tanks and a bewildering array of ships and aircraft.   Following is a look at some of the most significantmilitary factors:                                                                                                          TROOPS                                                                                                          The land forces of the U.S. and its allies include about360,000 Americans, with 75,000 Marines and 285,000 Armytroops, along with almost 200,000 soldiers from alliedcountries, a force 10 times larger than the Union Army atGettysburg.   Although the exact positions of the allied forces remainsecret, two Marine divisions are moving north toward KuwaitCity. They are accompanied by a brigade from the expatriateKuwaiti army seeking to recapture its capital city. Theheavyweight U.S. 7th Army Corps is flanking Kuwait, aiming tocut off the Republican Guard units along the northwestborder. Those Americans are accompanied by British and Frenchdivisions and some American airborne forces.   Allied Arab units, including Saudis, Egyptians andSyrians, hold the center of the line and also are movingnorth.   At sea, there are two Marine amphibious brigades, totalingabout 17,000 troops, positioned within striking distance ofland and used so far in feinting maneuvers to hold as many as100,000 Iraqi troops in place.   So far, the 500,000-man Iraqi army in the battle theaterhas shown little interest in standing up to allied forces.But that could change when fast-moving allied units approachthe bunkers of the elite 90,000-man Republican Guard at theIraqi border, and as other allied forces face the possibilityof street fighting in Kuwait City.   Details are still sketchy, but most of the thousands ofsurrendering Iraqis are regular army troops from basicinfantry divisions at the front.                                                                                                          CHEMICAL WEAPONS                                                                                                          If there is still a mystery about the Iraqi army's will tofight, there is also a mystery about its willingness to usechemical weapons. After all, the Iraqi army is the world'smost experienced in their use on the battlefield.   Poison gas is most effective against stationary troops orinfantry massed for attack. Likely scenarios for Iraqis tofire chemical weapons would be siege warfare with entrenchedGuard units or street fighting in Kuwait City.   Allied troops are equipped with gas masks and protectiveclothing, but wearing this gear reduces the individualsoldier's combat effectiveness.   By the end of the war with Iran, the Iraqi army hadperfected a technique in which it fired thousands ofartillery rounds, mixing them in a &quot;cocktail&quot; of conventionalwarheads along with shells containing cyanide gas and nerveagents. Cyanide irritates the lungs and eyes and ultimatelydestroys blood cells. Nerve agents -- the Iraqis generallyuse one called Tabun -- disrupt the nervous system, leadingto convulsions and paralysis. The Iraqis also bombed theenemy's rear formations with shells containing mustard gas, ablistering agent.                                                                                                          ARTILLERY                                                                                                          The Iraqis' sporadic use of artillery so far belies thefact that they began the war with some of the world's finestlong-range guns and howitzers. Allied commanders say much ofthis arsenal has been destroyed, but no one doubts the Iraqisstill possess more than 2,000 self-propelled and towedweapons that generally have a longer range than their U.S.opposing numbers.   Iraq has been on an artillery shopping spree for years,picking up hundreds of advanced-design weapons from SouthAfrica, Austria and France. The most powerful guns, firinghighly sophisticated shells, were designed by Gerald Bull, aCanadian-born artillery genius thwarted in his early effortsto sell his designs to Western armies.   Iraq has also produced, at least in prototype form, themost powerful gun in the world, the 210mm &quot;Al Fao,&quot; with arange of 35 miles, twice the range of the biggest alliedguns.   The problem with Iraqi artillery is targeting and firecontrol, and never more so than when the enemy is moving asquickly as allied forces now are.   Though allied gunners may be outranged, their fire-controltechniques are much more sophisticated, ideally suited to afluid battlefield. By most estimates, there are well over1,500 big allied guns in the theater.   Despite yesterday's attack on Dhahran, military officialsconsider Iraq's arsenal of Scud missiles to be a minormilitary threat.                                                                                                          TANKS                                                                                                          In this lineup, the contest is basically between the U.S.Army's 63-ton M-1 Abrams tank and the Iraqis' 46-ton,Soviet-built T-72. So far, it has been no contest.   It carries 500 gallons of fuel, maintains a top speed of41 miles an hour and has a maximum range of about 290 miles.According to Gregory Fetter, a senior analyst with defenseconsultant Forecast International, it's &quot;the best armoredoperational tank in the world.&quot;   But it does guzzle a lot of gas. Keeping oneAbrams-equipped armored division on the move requires 600,000gallons of fuel a day, twice as much as required in a singleday by George Patton's entire army in World War II.   The only other U.S. tank in this contest is the modifiedM-60, which weighs 52 tons and can travel at 30 mph. It isserving with the Marine Corps and the Saudi Arabian army.   Iraq's T-72 is smaller than either the M-1 or M-60, but itis equipped with a slightly larger, 125mm gun. It's alsoequipped with a 780-horsepower engine and has a top speed of37 mph. Its maximum range is a little better than 400 miles.   &quot;The T-72,&quot; says Mr. Fetter, &quot;is a good, agile, powerfultank to which the Iraqis have added a lot of armor.&quot; TheIraqis began this war with as many as 1,000 of these modernT-72 tanks (against 1,200 Abrams tanks serving with U.S.divisions). Iraq's next-best tanks are the modernizedSoviet-built T-62s and T-55s; it has as many as 3,000 inservice.                                                                                                          AIR SUPPORT                                                                                                          Allied air power, after enjoying complete control of theskies, is now involved in the new and far more risky missionof providing support to advancing tank columns.   Army commanders are using missiles to kill hundreds ofIraqi tanks before they can fire their first rounds, andwaves of Apache helicopters to stun Iraqi divisions. But asF-16 fighters, tank-killing A-10 jets and squadrons ofground-hugging U.S. choppers fly lower and slower to providecover for ground thrusts, pilots and their aircraft shouldbecome vulnerable to remaining Iraqi air defenses. Theirsurvival rate so far is a source of pride for alliedcommanders.                                                                                                          NAVAL POWER                                                                                                          U.S. generals are confident that Iraq's small navy,including a few captured Kuwaiti patrol craft, effectivelyhas been destroyed. But U.S. Navy officers still worry aboutmissile attacks, mines and even commando raids launched fromsmall boats or coastal freighters plying the Red Sea, thePersian Gulf and nearby waterways.   Iraq's remaining top-of-the-line jet fighters, now in Iranbut possibly still armed with ship-killing missiles, alsocould pose a danger to U.S. naval forces. Indeed, the topU.S. admiral in the Gulf recently warned that those planesactually are closer to allied vessels than if they had stayedinside Iraqi shelters. British reports said Iraq yesterdayfired two Chinese-made Silkworm missiles at allied ships,apparently to no effect.   The largest U.S. armada assembled since the height of theVietnam War includes six aircraft carriers, two World WarII-vintage battleships positioned to shell coastal positions,and the Navy's most sophisticated guided-missile destroyersand mine-clearing vessels. The U.S. also had more than 30amphibious vessels clustered offshore prepared to strikeKuwaiti beaches or southern Iraq's marshy islands.   ---   Compiled by James M.
