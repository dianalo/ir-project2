Tuesday said its third-quarterearnings declined 23 percent to $175 million, or 62 cents pershare, with operating income falling nearly 14 percent due largelyto asset sales.   Quarterly sales grew slightly to $4.4 billion from $4.2 billiona year earlier, when net income was $228 million, or 80 cents pershare. Earnings in the 1988 quarter were boosted by a $71 milliongain on a federal tax issue.   The energy and steel company said operating income soared $104million to $84 million at the exploration and production end of itsMarathon Oil Co. subsidiary, while operating income plunged $84million, or 75 percent, to $112 million at Marathon's refining,marketing and transportation operations.   Upstream operations benefited from higher prices. Downstreamoperations were hurt by lower refined product margins, USX said.   Overall operating income was $302 million, compared with $350million in the 1988 third quarter.   Operating income in steel fell 10.5 percent from $95 million onsales of $1.4 billion to $85 million on sales of $1.3 billion. USXattributed the decline to the sale of its Lorain, Ohio, plant to ajoint venture with Kobe Steel Ltd. of Japan.   Steel's performance remained favorable despite weakness in themarket for oil country tubular goods and moderate declines indemand in other steel markets, the company said.   Nine-month net earnings rose 20.5 percent to $721 million, or$2.62 per share, on sales of $13.8 billion from $598 million, or$2.07 per share, on sales of $12.5 billion.   ``The improvement resulted primarily from better results in theenergy segment, where operating income was more than twice the 1988level,'' said Chairman Charles A. Corry.   Asset sales contributed $312 million to total pretax income of$1.1 billion in the period, he said.   USX said in October it is soliciting bids for its Texas Oil andamp;Gas Corp. subsidiary, where a third-quarter operating loss of $9million represented an improvement of $6 million.</TEXT></DOC>
