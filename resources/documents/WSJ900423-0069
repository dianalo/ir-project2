Vice President Dan Quayle says he would rathercut back on &quot;unnecessary&quot; regulations.   Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, wants the government'stop economic officials to sit on the National SecurityCouncil; the Republican Mr. Quayle would rather think aboutchanging antitrust laws. And while Mr. Gephardt wants morefederal support for U.S. exports, Mr. Quayle wants to clampdown on liability suits.</LP><TEXT>   The two fair-haired men of their respective parties agreethat the U.S. faces a big problem with something called&quot;competitiveness,&quot; and they both want to do something aboutit. But they have been charting very different approaches tothe nation's economic challenges.   Competitiveness is a topic that will continue to bedebated as the U.S. increasingly moves away frompreoccupation with Cold War issues to concern about economicstrength and foreign competition. While the two men certainlyaren't the only participants in this debate, they have becomeimportant spokesmen for their respective parties andideologies: Vice President Quayle through his chairmanship ofthe Bush administration's Council on Competitiveness, Rep.Gephardt through his leadership post in the House and hiscontinued outspokenness on the trade issues that he stressedin his 1988 presidential bid.   Not surprisingly, there's an important political dimensionto the debate between the ambitious young Midwesterners withpresidential aspirations. &quot;It's a very good issue forGephardt,&quot; says Brookings Institution analyst Stephen Hess.&quot;It may be at the cutting edge of the issues the Democratsneed to insinuate themselves back into the White House: moreprotectionism, playing to union `Buy America' support andconcern about the Japanese.&quot;   On the other hand, Mr. Hess adds, competitiveness is moreof a defensive issue for the Republicans. &quot;They're in powerand have got to be more restrained. Whatever Quayle does iseither going to have to be very modest or very circumspectand very responsible.&quot;   But there could be dangers for Democrats, too. An overtprotectionist message &quot;runs counter to some basic Americaninstincts,&quot; cautions Democratic political consultant GregSchneiders. Noting the failure of Mr. Gephardt's presidentialbid, Mr. Schneiders says that if a program &quot;begins to look orsound like any kind of management of the economy, I thinkpeople will shy away from it.&quot;   The two sides begin by framing the issue in similar terms:The country isn't in a crisis, progress is being made on thetrade deficit and other problems, but some serious policyquestions remain nonetheless.   &quot;Some of the concerns {about competitiveness} areoverstated,&quot; stemming from Americans' anxieties aboutrecession, the dollar and the burgeoning trade and budgetdeficits of the last decade, says Burton Pines, a vicepresident of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank here. &quot;What isn't overstated is the potential threat.Are we competitive? Yes, we are. But could we do more toenhance our ability to compete? Yes, we could.&quot;   In some ways, the vice president's task is morechallenging than Rep. Gephardt's: How to articulate apositive strategy without violating his president's longtimeabhorrence of government intervention in the private sector.&quot;My role,&quot; Mr. Quayle says, &quot;is to look at the question ofhow do we take the burdens off our private sector, theburdens we impose ourselves,&quot; as well as keeping up thepresident's drumbeat on cutting the capital-gains tax. &quot;Whatwe have to do is get consistency and continuity within ourown playing field.&quot;   So far, the Competitiveness Council's main project hasbeen supporting a bill by Sens. Robert Kasten (R., Wis.) andJohn Rockefeller (D., W.Va.) to impose some federal limits onliability lawsuits and to curb some big product-liabilityjudgments, a major complaint of businesses in the wake ofescalating insurance and litigation costs. Strongly opposedby trial lawyers and some consumer groups, such legislationhas been stalled for a decade.   But the sponsors hope the added push from theadministration's support will enable the bill at least toclear the Senate by year end. By then, the council hopes tohave proposals on two other issues: advancing thecommercialization of biotechnology research and modifyingantitrust laws to allow more corporate mergers.   Ironically, some of the vice president's natural allies inthe business community and the conservative movement aredisappointed in his performance on the competitiveness issue.&quot;Quayle's got to do more on that. That's an area where hecould really do something,&quot; says the Heritage Foundation'sMr. Pines.   Among his suggestions: Mr. Quayle and the council shoulddevelop a &quot;nice, easy&quot; definition of competitiveness thatstresses certain conservative principles, such as freedom ofchoice. A Heritage working group also has suggested thatproponents of new regulations be required to come up with a&quot;competitiveness impact statement&quot; that would detail theeconomic consequences of their proposals. Heritage also callsfor a stronger push on areas such as antitrust, saying thelaws are outmoded in an era of strong foreign competition andsubstantial cooperation between Japanese and Europeancompanies.   Others say that while the projects undertaken by thecouncil are fine as far as they go, the scope remains toosmall. &quot;Overall, I wouldn't give them {council members} veryhigh grades,&quot; says Paul Huard, a vice president with theNational Association of Manufacturers. &quot;They're not reallyserious, as near as we can tell, about doing something aboutthe high cost of capital. They talk about doing somethingabout research and development, about depreciation. They talkabout it, they're studying it, but basically there isn't muchforward motion.&quot;   Mr. Quayle's staffers defend his approach, saying he'slimited in part by his role, since other departments havespecific responsibilities for issues such as addressing thebudget deficit. They also point to Bushadministration-sponsored increases in the research andeducation budgets as evidence of serious commitment. But evenmore important, according to Mr. Quayle's chief of staff,William Kristol, &quot;our first task has been to knock down allthe bad ideas by Democrats on the Hill.&quot;   Some of those &quot;bad ideas&quot; he refers to come from Rep.Gephardt, whose comprehensive legislation -- a Trade andTechnology Promotion Act introduced last fall -- will beclosely reviewed by several committees in the next few weeks.Among Mr. Gephardt's key proposals: to require that thepresident's commerce, Treasury and trade advisers be givenseats on the National Security Council, a move he says isnecessary to raise the profile of economic issues and givethem parity with foreign policy and national security. Healso wants to develop a new agency that would help fosterresearch and application of so-called &quot;emergingtechnologies.&quot;   &quot;The Republican view, the conservative view, is that thegovernment has no role -- that the government simplyderegulates and the private sector will take care of therest,&quot; says the St. Louis Democrat, whose district includessuppliers to the Big Three auto makers, a leading aircraftmanufacturer and numerous other manufacturing concerns.   &quot;I think the better view is that we're up againstcompetition, which in some cases benefits from closecooperation with the government. While we can't emulate thatentirely,&quot; Rep. Gephardt says, &quot;government needs to create abetter environment in which our private sector can developand market its products.&quot;   To criticisms from conservatives that his approach wouldbe too interventionist, Mr. Gephardt responds that he doesn'tsee that at all, noting that the government has previouslyaided the development of some defense-related technologies.He also contends that better coordination is needed among thedifferent agencies. What good does it do, he asks, for theU.S. trade representative to push to open markets that don'toffer the largest long-term opportunities for U.S.businesses? And while product-liability and antitrustmeasures may &quot;have merit,&quot; he argues they aren't aggressiveenough steps to aid U.S. companies.   Neither the vice president's nor the House majorityleader's approach is likely to be adopted in the near term,but advocates for both men say they look forward toopportunities to explain their differences. &quot;The issue of howto keep America strong is a major issue,&quot; says Mr. Kristol.&quot;I think we'll increasingly help to define the differencesbetween the administration and the Democrats,&quot; especially, headded, &quot;as the fall campaign heats up.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
