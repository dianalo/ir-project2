This innocuous idea, imbedded in &quot;The CompetitiveAdvantage of Nations&quot; (Free Press, 855 pages, $35), has beensurprisingly controversial, greeted as either heresy orrevelation. Economists, for instance, seem annoyed with Mr.Porter because he emphasizes case studies of particularindustries, such as the motion-picture industry in the U.S.or printing presses in Germany. Further, he dismisses suchcherished &quot;macroeconomic&quot; statistics as budget deficits andexchange rates.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Nations have enjoyed rapidly rising living standards,&quot; henotes, &quot;despite budget deficits {Japan, Italy, Korea},appreciating currencies {Germany and Switzerland}, and highinterest rates {Italy and Korea}.&quot;   A further source of irritation may be the way in whichthis book immediately surrenders its title: &quot;We must abandonthe whole notion of a `competitive nation' . . . The onlymeaningful concept of competitiveness at the national levelis national productivity.&quot;   In fact, the concept of productivity has its limitations.For example, output per worker might be increased,Europeanstyle, by leaving all but the most productive workersunemployed-through high minimum wages or formidablerestrictions on layoffs. But Mr. Porter doesn't really stickto his own productivity standard for measuring nationalsuccess. Instead, he simply dismisses the recent doubling ofproductivity growth in manufacturing in the U.S., from the1970s to the 1980s.   This is &quot;not yet a sign of fundamental change,&quot; he argues,quickly switching to other measures of success, looking atshares of world exports, or &quot;outbound&quot; foreign investment --investment in other countries.   &quot;Inbound foreign investment,&quot; he claims, &quot;is never thesolution to a nation's competitive problems.&quot; Why not? Are wereally to believe that the U.S. doesn't make better carstoday as a result of the many Japanese factories on U.S.soil? Would Canada really be as affluent as it is without allthe U.S. producers located there?   When criticizing the U.S., Mr. Porter wants to have itboth ways. If foreign companies invest in the U.S., he arguesthat this means American firms are missing opportunities toupgrade technology. If U.S. firms invest abroad, on the otherhand, Mr. Porter argues that this means American companies(unlike foreign companies in the U.S.) do not know how toproduce efficiently in their own country.   Indeed, Mr. Porter's narrow concept of what constitutes a&quot;domestic&quot; industry is archaic and provincial in a world oftransnational companies. His applause for the revival of theSwiss watch industry, for example, neglects the fact thatseveral of the most famous Swiss brands are now owned by aU.S. entrepreneur, North American Watch. Is a Chrysler with aMitsubishi engine really more &quot;American&quot; than a Ford ProbeLX, which is built in Michigan with a U.S. engine?   Aside from &quot;outbound&quot; foreign investment, the author'sonly other measure of competitive advantage -- shares of&quot;world exports&quot; -- is equally slanted against the U.S. Worldexports have been heavily dominated by expanding exports tothe U.S., which is one race that U.S. firms can't even enter.How could the U.S. be expected to export itself?   Mr. Porter draws pictures to illustrate his theory, withfour national attributes forming a &quot;diamond&quot; of competitiveadvantage -- rivalry, demand conditions, factor conditionsand &quot;clusters&quot; of supporting industries. This is just apedagogic device for expanding a simple idea into hundreds ofpages, dividing it into four parts and four related &quot;stages&quot;of development.   Under the category of &quot;demand conditions,&quot; for example,Mr. Porter asserts, without evidence, that American consumersand retailers are no longer very &quot;sophisticated.&quot; Yet this iscontradicted by his own chapter on services, which shows theU.S. in the &quot;leading position&quot; in retailing.   Mr. Porter asserts that &quot;high {educational} standards and&quot;a federal role in education&quot; are &quot;vital.&quot; Yet manyeducational specialists are arguing for more diversity,competition and choice in schooling. Since competition is thedriving force behind constant improvement in industry, whyshould it not have the same effect in education?   The book's basic theme, that competition fostersinnovation, serves as a welcome antitoxin to the revival ofcorporatist &quot;social engineering&quot; ideas that instead depictcompetition as wasteful and cartels (&quot;strategic alliances&quot;)as innovative. It also serves to warn developing countriesnot to penalize important domestic markets in favor of exportpromotion. The case studies on how specific industriesprospered in various countries undoubtedly contain manyinsights of value to business strategists.   Yet the title misleads. There is very little substancehere on the ways in which national policies, including tax,trade and monetary policies, create more or less favorableconditions for individuals and enterprises to generatewealth.   ---   Mr. Reynolds is director of economic research at theHudson Institute in Indianapolis.</TEXT></DOC>
