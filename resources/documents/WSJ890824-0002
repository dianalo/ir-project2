Paul Sau-Ki Cheng, 34 years old, and Simon Edward Heath, 35, are accused in the 17-count indictment of causing the thrift to lend $10 million on an over-valued piece of Florida property that they owned through Pacific Realty Corp.    Messrs. Cheng and Heath, who could not be reached for comment, had been under investigation for at least seven months by the Justice Department's Bank Fraud Task Force in Dallas. Spokesmen for the U.S. Department of Justice could not be reached for comment on details of the charges.    Guaranty Federal was placed in receivership by federal thrift regulators in September 1988 and was acquired with two other thrifts in a joint venture led by Temple-Inland Inc. of Diboll, Texas. The institution is now known as Guaranty Federal Savings Bank. </TEXT></DOC>
