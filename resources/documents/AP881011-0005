Minor editing inremainder.</NOTE><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The primary plutonium processing facility at theRocky Flats nuclear weapons plant outside Denver has been shut downbecause of a ``minor safety incident'' that happened last month,the Department of Energy said.   The DOE and Rockwell International Corp., which operates theplant under contract for the DOE, said there was no leak ofradioactive material.   ``There was no release of any radioactive material in thebuilding, nor any threat to the public or the environment,''Rockwell said in a news release.   But the DOE said three people were tested for ``potential healtheffects.'' Neither the DOE nor Rockwell on Saturday said why theemployees underwent health tests.   The Rocky Flats plant makes plutonium triggers for nuclearweapons, and the affected building processes manufacturing wastesback to pure plutonium.   Rockwell spokesman Ed Heintz said Monday the shutdown would notaffect production elsewhere at the plant. He said the building's575 employees would not be laid off during the shutdown. The plantemploys 5,000 people.   However, Richard W. Starostecki, the DOE's top safety expert,said in an interview published in Tuesday's editions of The NewYork Times, that the shutdown was in a building where classifiedwork vital to the entire plant's operation is performed. Theshutdown essentially halts all production at the plant, theofficial said in Washington.   The incident occurred Sept. 29 in Building 771 at the plant 16miles northwest of Denver, and the DOE said activities in thebuilding were halted Saturday.   Heintz would not elaborate on the incident. He said it would beup to the DOE to decide when the building reopens, and a restartteam was formed Saturday.   Starostecki said the order came about after a DOE inspector andtwo Rockwell employees were contaminated by plutonium when theyunwittingly walked into an unmarked room where maintenance andcleanup work was being performed on plutonium contaminatedequipment.   Rockwell will conduct a semi-annual inventory of nuclearmaterials in the building during the shutdown, the DOE said.   The DOE said Rockwell curtailed maintenance and constructionactivities in the building last Tuesday to review the situation.The review determined, among other things, that airborneradioactive contamination levels were within DOE-EnvironmentalProtection Agency guidelines, but higher than DOE goals.   Early this year, a DOE team reported ``serious concerns'' withradiation monitoring practices at the weapons plant. The team spenta week auditing the plant and plutonium processing, paying what ittermed close attention to the calibration of plant radiationmeasurement equipment.   At another nuclear weapons plant, the Savannah River Plant nearAiken, S.C., it was disclosed last week that up to 30 significantmishaps occurred at the plant over the past three decades, and thatmany had not been reported to Washington or disclosed to the public.   All three reactors at the Savannah River Plant have been shutdown since August when a mishap idled one of the reactors. Theplant makes two materials used in nuclear weapons, plutonium andtritium.</TEXT></DOC>
