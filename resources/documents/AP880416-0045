(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A giant Air Force cargo jettransporting 45 tons of sophisticated gear to a historic experimentin the Soviet Union finished the first leg of its journey today,officials said.   The giant C-5B cargo jet lumbered down a rain-slick runway at aremote desert base north of Las Vegas on Friday and headed for itshome base in Dover, Del., the first stop en route to a Soviet testsite at Semipalatinsk 2,000 miles southeast of Moscow.   The plane reached Dover Air Force Base this morning, refueledand continued on its journey, said Capt. Walter Thorp, a basespokesman.   The plane carried 12 scientists and engineers, plus equipment tomeasure shafts being dug for Joint Verification Experiments, saidRoger Harrison, an assistant secretary of state, and Troy Wade,acting assistant secretary of energy.   The experiments are designed to demonstrate the reliability of atechnology the Reagan administration says is needed to verify thethreshold treaties, which were reached in the 1970s but neverratified by the Senate.   Negotiations in Geneva are expected to produce an agreement intime for the Moscow summit at the end of May, spelling outconditions for the experiments.   Energy Department officials believe the tests could take placeas early as this summer, with U.S. scientists on hand to monitor aSoviet test and Soviet scientists traveling to the Nevada Test Siteto monitor an American test.   ``We are walking very slowly down this path,'' Nick Aquilina,head of the DOE's Nevada Operations Office, said in Las Vegas onFriday before the flight departed. ``We don't know if this takes usone step closer or 10 steps closer (to a test ban). We don't knowif it's a small step or a large step.''   The Nevada Operations Office conducts the nation's nucleartesting program.   Both sides claim to have observed treaties which limit tests tono more than 150 kilotons, although the Reagan administration hassaid the Soviets probably exceeded the ceiling on some tests.   The next step would be negotiations on limiting the size andnumber of tests. A complete ban on testing could come as the twosides near completion of negotiations on eliminating nuclearweapons, Harrison said.   ``As long as we have to rely on nuclear weapons for oursecurity, we will test,'' Harrison told reporters.   The Soviets have been pushing for a ban on testing, andunilaterally suspended testing for 18 months ending in February1987. The Reagan administration refused to join the moratorium.   The equipment which left Nevada on Friday will be used for anexperiment tentatively scheduled in July to test a U.S. techniqueknown as CORRTEX, in which the size of a nuclear blast is measuredthrough a cable within 15 yards of a test shaft.   The Soviets have balked at using CORRTEX, which stands forContinuous Reflectometry for Radius Versus Time Experiment, sayingtests could be monitored with seismic devices at long range.   ``Our stand is that we need on-site verification,'' Chris West,a DOE spokesman in Las Vegas, said Friday.   A team of 40 to 50 Americans will travel to the Soviet test siteto monitor the underground explosion of a Soviet nuclear chargenear the 150-kiloton threshold.   A Soviet team will set up its own equipment to measure a test tobe conducted at the Nevada site, Wade said.   Both tests are expected to be completed by mid-July, accordingto arms control officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.   U.S. officials had hoped to conduct the experiments in April,but the tests were delayed by negotiations over technical details,one official said.</TEXT></DOC>
