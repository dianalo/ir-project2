Rebels also fired three rockets into the capital, but there wereno reports of injuries or deaths, government officials said.   The government also said the army opened fire to stop a fightthat broke out Tuesday when several people tried to cut into a longline at a gasoline station. Officials said two people were killedand three injured, but witnesses said at least eight pople died and35 were injured.   In Kandahar, the nation's second-largest city, 400 Afghan troopsdefected to the insurgents during rebel assaults over the weekendand two helicopter gunships were destroyed at the military airport,rebels said Wednesday in Pakistan.   According to an Interior Ministry spokesman in Kabul, a Sovietconvoy pulled out of the Afghan capital on Wednesday and headed upthe Salang Highway, the only route leading to the Soviet border.   The spokesman, who identified himself only as Hamad, said tanksand trucks carrying from 10 to 50 soldiers each moved through acheckpoint about two miles north of Kabul about 6 a.m.   He said the soldiers seemed happy to be on their way home. ``Theywere smiling and they were smiling and waving,'' the spokesman said.   About two miles farther north, Moslem rebels fighting to oust theSoviet-backed government of President Najib bombarded the convoywith rockets.   Because of the shelling, Afghan soldiers refused to allow anyonepast the checkpoint without permission from the Interior Ministry.   The mountainous, 260-mile road has been the scene of heavyfighting between Soviet and Afghan forces and the U.S.-supportedrebels based in Pakistan.   Under a U.N.-sponsored agreement signed in April, the 115,000Soviet troops sent into Afghanistan to prop up the Marixstgovernment in late 1979 are to be gone by Feb. 15. Western andSoviet diplomats estimate that only 15,000 Red Army soldiers remainin Afghanistan.   As the withdrawal deadline approached, Soviet soldiers turnedover outposts along the perimeter road around Kabul to the Afghanforces.   Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, the commander of the Soviet troops inAfghanistan, said Tuesday he is confident the Afghans can hold ontothe Salang Highway and the key mountain pass that has been the sceneof heavy fighting.   The Soviets have assured the Afghan government they will continueto provide military assistance to Afghanistan after the last Sovietsoldiers return home. But the Soviets have not said when thatassistance will arrive.   An estimted 1,000 flatbed trucks carrying rocket launchers,ammunition and small missiles move along the highway every day,Afghan officers stationed along the road have said.   The Soviets also use the highway to carry flour, eggs, kerosene,fuel and other supplies to the capital, where food and fuelshortages have been reported in recent weeks, partly due to rebelattacks on convoys moving on the highway.   The emergency shipments have helped ease the long lines thatformed outside bread shacks. Most lines have disappeared or becomenoticeably shorter.   Local officias say they have at least a three-month reserve, butone U.S. official in Washington said Tuesday there was only enoughto last a few days.   Several diplomats and relief workers, however, dismissed theclaim.   ``Washington is either very pessimistic or they think we reallyeat a lot,'' said one U.N. official, speaking on condition ofanonymity. However, long lines still form outside the gasolinestations and stretch for blocks.   It was unclear how long the Soviet tranport will continue toKabul, where refugees from the war have more than doubled thepopulation to 2 million.   Packed buses, many with people riding on top with their thin,ragged shawls flapping in the cold wind, arrive in the capital daily.   Rockets are periodically fired into the capital. Two car bombsexploded this week, and two suitcase bombs were found and defused atthe airport. Several missiles also have been fired at the airportand at departing planes.   The Afghan soldiers who defected in southeastern Kandaharsurrendered large quantities of arms and ammunition, according toQaribur Rehman Saeed, a spokesman for the Hezb-i-Islami guerrillagroup.   Saeed, who runs the rebel Afghan News Agency, said guerrillaslaunched combined assaults on Kandahar airport on Saturday,``inflicting untold losses on the puppet troops'' and destroying twohelicopter gunships. The news agency said the insurgents attackedsecurity posts around Kandahar province Sunday and captured weapons,rockets and military trucks.</TEXT></DOC>
