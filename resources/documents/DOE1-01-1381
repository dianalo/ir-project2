It wasfound that in conifers, in contrast to other plants, quinate dehydrogenaseis active both with NAD and with NADP. The values of K/sub m/ for quinateand NADP were 1.8 and 0.18 mM. The enzyme exhibits maximum activity atpH 9.0. It was assumed that NADP-dependent quinate dehydrogenase is responsiblefor quinic acid synthesis. The special features of the organization andregulation of the initial stages of the shikimate pathway in conifersare discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
