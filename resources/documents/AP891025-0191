WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush's veto of a bill to provideabortion assistance to impoverished victims of rape and incest wassustained in the House on Wednesday as a 231-191 vote to overridehim fell 51 votes short of the necessary two-thirds margin.   Though narrow in scope, the bill carried symbolic importance inthe widening political struggle over the abortion issue, andproponents took their loss with a vow to keep the president's feetto the fire. But Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., called it ``a decisivevictory for the pro-life movement.''   ``The president won a legislative victory today with use of alegislative minority,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore. ``He will puthis party at tremendous risk in the next election, and some of hisallies on the House floor will not be returned.''   A Republican, Rep. Bill Green of New York, who supported thebill, said ``President Bush may well have stumbled on the one issuethat could cost him re-election.''   The vote, in which 42 Republicans joined 189 Democrats in theunsuccessful bid to enact the bill over the president's veto, leftintact an 8-year-old ban of federal financing of abortions for poorwomen, except when their lives are threatened.   ``We're pleased,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.``It shows strong support for the president's position.''   The disputed provision would have permitted Medicaid abortionsfor women who are victims of rape or incest, and who ``reportedpromptly'' to authorities. It was part of a spending bill that nowgoes back to the House Appropriations Committee for revision.   Smith and other abortion opponents said the vote demonstratedthey can overcome future efforts to weaken the prohibition on mostMedicaid abortions, adding that it shows the political ground hasnot shifted in favor of abortion rights, as some politicalstrategists argue.   ``They made the mistake of thinking this was a one-roundfight,'' said Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn.   ``Some members who were panicked by pro-abortion propaganda inthe last few weeks are going to be surprised, because the finaltale hasn't been told on how this issue is cutting more liberal languagehad passedthe House, although it had easily cleared the Senate.   Abortion-rights supporters picked up a net 15 votes on theoverride vote. But some of those who switched positions said theydid so for other reasons, since the vote affected the entire $156.7billion spending bill.   Fifty-nine Democrats and 132 Republicans voted to sustain theveto.   Eleven members did not vote, including Rep. James Courter, aRepublican who running for governor of New Jersey and who has beenaccused of waffling on the abortion issue. His opponent, DemocraticRep. James Florio, voted to override and later said Courter ``choseto say this was not an issue of enough importance to adjust hisschedule to be here.''   Smith, the anti-abortion leader, attributed most of the switchesto other issues but said there were ``a few marginal members whohave capitulated.''   House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., said Democrats had not decidedon their next move. House Democratic Whip Bill Gray, D-Pa., said hedid not think Democrats would attempt to add similar abortionlanguage again to the same appropriations bill.   Leaders of the move to liberalize Medicaid abortions held outthat possibility, however, and said in any event they would raisethe issue repeatedly by attempting to add similar language to otherbills.   ``We will keep coming back,'' said Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.   The vote followed an emotion-packed debate on the House floor.   Abortion-rights forces condemned Bush's veto as anunconscionable infringement on the rights of poor women andchildren victimized by rape and incest _ and one that will bringpolitical damage to Republicans.   Abortion foes cast the issue as a moral one that would invitewidespread federal financing of abortions.   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., author of the current ban known as the``Hyde amendment,'' pleaded, ``Don't force death upon an innocentvictim.''   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., raised the name of Willie Horton, theman who Republicans and the Bush campaign cited last year asevidence that Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis, the governor ofMassachusetts, was soft on crime. Horton had raped a Maryland womanwhile on furlough from a Massachusetts prison.   ``God was gracious and Willie Horton did not impregnate thatwoman,'' Hoyer said. ``But if he had, ... which one of us wouldhave stood before her and said, `Carry Willie Horton's baby toterm.'''   In an indication of how politically difficult the vote wasregarded, the House Republican leader, Rep. Robert Michel, R-Ill.,said he would vote with Bush while suggesting he could changepositions later.</TEXT></DOC>
