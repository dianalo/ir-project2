Inbrief, the scope of each set of Procedures is as follows. The Claims Proceduresgovern the filing, and determination by the FSLIC as Receiver, of claimsfor monetary recovery and other forms of relief by creditors and otherpotential claimants against the receivership of savings institutions forwhich the Board has appointed the FSLIC as Reciever. The Review Proceduresgovern the filing, and final determination by the Board, of challengesto determinations by the FSLIC as Receiver pursuant to the Claims Procedures.The Expedited Relief Procedures, which provide a separate avenue of relieffrom the Claims and Review Procedures, govern the filing and determination,by the Board, of requests for declaratory, injunctive, or other equitablerelief by persons faced with a threatened action of the FSLIC as Receiver,for example, a notice of foreclosure, an action for eviction, or repudiationof a contract.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ As noted in the Supplemental Notice, this supplementalrulemaking subsumes only a portion of the rulemaking proceeding regardingthe conduct of FSLIC receiverships that the Board began in November 1985.<T3>See </T3>50 FR 48970 (Nov. 27, 1985); 53 FR 25129 (July 5, 1988). Three comments were received on the proposal; two from individuals andone from a trade association. The commenters questioned the statutory basis,the constitutionality, and the practical efficacy of the requirement thatpersons filing claims with, or seeking relief from actions by, the FSLICas Receiver, exhaust their rights through an administrative process beforeseeking judicial intervention.The Board stated in the Supplemental Notice:<ITAG tagnum="20">the purpose of the proposed regulations is to provide a uniform procedureunder which persons seeking relief from actions threatened by the FSLICas Receiver for a failed institution, or seeking to recover funds or gainother relief from an FSLIC receivership, may exhaust their administrativeremedies at the Board. The Board regards such exhaustion as a prerequisiteto the availability of judicial review of actions by the FSLIC as Receiver.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">53 FR at 21474. By this statement, the Board sought to inform personsunfamiliar with its adjudicatory procedures that it believes claimantsand petitioners must exhaust those procedures as a prerequisite to judicialconsideration of their claims. The Board continues to hold that view andexpects that it will be validated in litigation now pending in the UnitedStates Supreme Court. <T3>See Coit Independence Joint Venture v. Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorporation as Receiver of FirstSouth, F.A., cert. granted</T3>, 108 S.Ct. 1105 (1988). In view of the pendency of that litigation, in which theissue of exhaustion of administrative remedies will be fully consideredand resolved, the issue will not be discussed herein. To the extent thatcommenters raised issues which would require action by Congress, thosecomments are also beyond the scope of this proceeding and will not be discussed.One commenter requested that the Board stay promulgation of final rulesuntil <T3>Coit </T3>is decided and/or Congress acts regarding codification ofthe exhaustion requirement. Such a stay would leave a regulatory vacuumfor an indefinite time, to the detriment of Claimants and others requiringBoard intervention, as well as to the FSLIC as Receiver. Other commentersraised issues regarding the proper scope and standard of judicial reviewof Bank Board decisions. Those issues should be resolved in judicial proceedingsor through legislation, and will not be considered in this rulemaking proceeding.Accordingly, the Board will discuss herein only comments relating to specificprovisions of the proposed regulations. All commenters proposed specificmodifications to the proposed regulations. These commenters recommendedthat the Board make clear that the FSLIC as Receiver, which all perceiveto be an interested party, is not the adjudicator in disputed receivershipmatters, and stands on an equal footing before the Board with claimantsand other third parties. One commenter proposed that the Board employ AdministrativeLaw Judges to conduct oral hearings where issues cannot be resolved ona written record, and that the Administrative Law Judge be empowered torequire parties to use alternative dispute resolution procedures, <T3>e.g., </T3>arbitration or mediation, in appropriate circumstances.All commenters recommended that the Board utilize, at least in some circumstances,oral hearing procedures, affording the parties the opportunity of cross-examinationand discovery, including the use of subpoenas. Two commenters protestedthat the Claims Procedures enable the Receiver to delay the resolutionof claims, and recommend that the Board adopt fixed time limits for thevarious steps in the claims determination process, or for the Receiver'sdetermination in general. Upon review of the comments and consideration of the Board's experiencesince publication of the Supplemental Notice, the Board has determinednot to make major modifications to the proposed regulations. As noted inthe Supplemental Notice (53 FR at 21474), the proposed regulations werebased upon Interim Procedures published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 21, 1988 (53 FR 13105). Those InterimProcedures were, in turn, the product of repeated refinement of proceduresthe Board has employed in hundreds of adjudicatory proceedings since early1986. As intended, numerous claimants and others are utilizing the procedures,and have exercised their rights to obtain judicial review of Board determinations.\2\<NOTE/> The Board believes that the proposed regulations are consistentwith the purposes enunciated in the Supplemental Notice, and should beadopted with only minor, technical modifications. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See McIlwain v. FSLIC, </T3>No. A-88-CA-597 (W.D. Tex., Aug. 2, 1988);<T3>Musacchio v. FSLIC, </T3>C 88-2227 (N.D. Cal., June 8, 1988); <T3>Gold Hawk Joint Venture, et al. v. FSLIC, </T3>No. 4-88-346-E (N.D.Cal., July 5, 1988); <T3>Black v. FHLBB,</T3> No. H-87-3298 (S.D. Tex., Oct. 8, 1987); <T3>Gray Falls Shopping Center, Ltd., et al. v. FSLIC, </T3>No. H-86-3877(S.D. Tex., Aug. 6, 1987); (consolidated judicial review of Board decisionsthat denied five Requests for Expedited Relief).In regard to the comments concerning specific features of the Board's proposedadjudicatory procedures, the Board has already addressed the concern thatthe FSLIC as Receiver should not be the adjudicator of claims and otherrequests for relief. The FSLIC as Receiver has no decisional function inregard to Requests for Expedited Relief, and, while it can allow or disallowclaims, under the final regulations and disallowance of a claim is notan adjudication, but merely a determination that the Receiver believesit is in the best interest of the estate to contest the claim. <T3>See </T3>andSection; 576.3(e) (Board may make its own findings of factand conclusions of law based upon the Administrative Record compiled inthe review of the Receiver's Determination). To date, the Board has notfound use of Administrative Law Judges or discovery or subpoena power tobe necessary. Moreover, legislation would likely be required for the Boardto employ Administrative Law Judges and to give the Board an effectivesubpoena mechanism and it would be impracticable to delay adopting finalregulations pending such Congressional action. One commenter recommendedthat the Board utilize alternative dispute resolution procedures. The Boardis willing to utilize such procedures on a case-by-case basis within theexisting adjudicatory process if the parties to an adjudication demonstratethat such procedures would serve the public interest. A specific rule onthis subject is, therefore, unnecessary. Finally, the Board finds somemerit to the suggestions that strict time limits be imposed upon the Receiver'sprocessing of claims. However, none of the parties proposed specific timelimits or attempted to supply data that would enable the Board to establishsuch limits. The Board will, through its developing experience in the adjudicativeprocess and through the collection of data relating to the determinationof claims, continue to investigate the need for, and proper scope of, timelimits for the Receiver's determination of claims. <ITAG tagnum="85">Summary of Technical Modifications to Proposed Regulations</ITAG>Upon further review of its experience in processing claims pursuant tothe Interim Procedures, the Board is adopting the rules as proposed, withthe following technical modifications. Proposed andSection; 575.1(a) is modified to clarify that the Claims Procedures,which govern actions of Special Representatives and managing officers ofreceiverships, also apply to their agents and employees.

Theseprocedures are to be followed by Special Representatives and managing officersof the receiverships and their agents and employees to assure compliancewith the Federal Regulations governing the processing and determinationof claims, and to insure uniformity of notices to claimants, documentationof claims, determination of the merits of claims by allowance or disallowancein whole or in part, payment of claims, and the review process. Full compliancewith and exhaustion of these procedures is a prerequisite to review bythe Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Judicial review of the disallowance inwhole or in part of a claim against the assets of the FSLIC as Receiveris available only after exhaustion of these procedures and review and finalagency action by the Board. These procedures are also applicable where,pursuant to statutory and regulatory authority, the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation is the Receiver for a Federal savings bank.  (b) The Board, in its regulations, and its Office of General Counsel, havemade it clear that the FSLIC as Receiver of an institution the accountsof which are insured by the FSLIC, recognizes the validity of certain securedobligations of insured institutions entered into pursuant to legal authority,and the right of secured creditor in certain circumstances to cause theliquidation of collateral.  (c) The General Counsels of the Board have rendered several opinions concerningthe status of collateralized obligations of a savings and loan associationfor which the Board has appointed the FSLIC as Receiver, beginning in 1983;and the Board has issued resolutions concerning the subject. These proceduresare not inconsistent with such opinion issued by General Counsels of theBoard or the Board's resolutions; and these procedures should not be takento mean or imply that compliance with the procedures is a condition precedentto liquitation of collateral in the circumstances in which the GeneralCounsel's opinions have indicated that a court would permit the liquidationof collateral or the Board has indicated by resolution or order that liquidationof collateral would be permitted.  (d) The Board, in adopting these procedures, is not directing the FSLICas Receiver to require such secured creditors to observe all such noticedprocedures as a precondition of exercising valid liquidation rights pursuantto valid security contracts entered into by an insured institution as authorizedunder its governing law prior to the appointment of the Receiver. Nor isthe Board directing the FSLIC as Receiver to subject such holders of participatinginterests that are not creditors of the insured institution in receivershipgenerally to such procedures. In the event, however, that a Receiver disputesa creditor's claim to a security interest in an asset in which the institutionhas an interest or a participant's characterization of its status, theReceiver may require such creditor or other entity to establish its claimedstatus prusuant to these procedures; and the Receiver in such cases maytake such action as it deems necessary to protect its interest in any asset.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 575.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG>For the purposes of these procedures, the procedures for Requests for Reviewpursuant to Part 576 of this chapter, and the procedures for Requests forExpedited Relief pursuant to Part 577 of this chapter, the following definitionsshall apply:(a)(1) ``Administrative expenses of the association'' means expenses incurredwithin thirty (30) days prior to the Receiver's taking possession of theassociation, and are limited to reasonable expenses incurred for servicesactually provided by accountants, attorneys, appraisers, examiners, ormanagement companies, or reasonable expenses incurred by employees whichwere authorized and reimbursable under a pre-existing expensed reimbursementpolicy, that, in the opinion of the Receiver, are of benefit to the receivership,and shall not include wages or salaries of employees of the association;(2) ``Administrative expenses of the Receiver'' means the costs, expenses,and debts of the Receiver;  (b) ``Affected Person'' means a person, corporation, partnershnip or otherlegal entity that owns or has an interest in real or personal property,or is otherwise obligated on a debt secured by real or personal property,against which the Receiver has expressd an intent to take action that mayaffect, impair, diminish, or terminate such interest.
