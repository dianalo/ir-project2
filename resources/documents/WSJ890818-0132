The deficit on the current account, which includes merchandise trade items, services and transfers, also represented a narrowing from the 2.5 billion krona deficit recorded in May.    The Riksbank attributed the deficit in June chiefly to slipping trade and service balances.    The first six months of this year showed a current-account deficit of 7.8 billion kronor, compared with a 3.2 billion krona deficit a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
