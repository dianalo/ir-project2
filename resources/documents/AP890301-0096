Rebels late Tuesday also attacked a coffee processing plant thatlocal radio stations said belonged to the presidential candidate ofthe rightist party favored to win elections scheduled this month.   Insurgents of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front saidthey killed 67 soldiers and wounded 25 in the attack on the militarydetachment in Santa Rosa de Lima, 110 miles east of San Salvador.   The rebel report, broadcast on a clandestine radio station,appeared to be greatly exaggerated.   A military source, commenting on condition of anonymity, saiddefenders of the detachment suffered ``some casualties'' but ``notmany.''   The Armed Forces Press Committee, in a preliminary report, saidtwo guerrillas and one civilian were killed in the two-hour attackon the garrison.   The rebels also struck the Mecafe coffee processing plant outsideNejapa, six miles north of San Salvador.   A spokesman at the Nejapa Civil Defense post, contacted bytelephone, said the installation, which dries and bags coffee beans,was completely destroyed by explosive charges detonated by therebels.   About 20 soldiers stationed at the plant battled the attackersbriefly before retreating, said the spokesman, who commented oncondition of anonymity. He said no casualties were reported.   Radio stations said the plant is the property of AlfredoCristiani, presidential candidate of Arena. The report could not beimmediately confirmed.   Cristiani is favored to win the presidential election scheduledfor March 19. Arena has refused rebel demands to postpone theelections.   The military had said it would halt attacks at midnight and hadurged the guerrillas _ who are trying to negotiate participation innational elections _ to also cease hostilities.   The military announced the three-month halt in offensiveoperations after the rebels offered to declare a unilateralcease-fire of their own to help facilitate direct peace talks withPresident Jose Napoleon Duarte.   However, the rebels rejected in their communique both the agendaand venue for the talks that Duarte called for on Sunday.   The armed forces said in a statement that the cease-fire tookhold at midnight Tuesday and would last until June 1, Duarte's lastday in office.   It did not say whether the military would abide by the truce ifthe guerrillas kept up their attacks.   On Jan. 24, the rebels offered to take part in and respect theresults of the presidential vote if it was postponed several months.They have boycotted the decade's five previous national elections.   Duarte had called for a three-month cease-fire and for talks onending the civil war to begin Tuesday in Guatemala. He also said hefavored holding the presidential vote on April 30.   The rebels rejected the site, saying talks should be Saturday andSunday in San Salvador. They also balked at an unilateralcease-fire, insisting a lasting truce should be part of thenegotiations.   An estimated 70,000 people have been killed and 500,000 to 1million people displaced during the civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
