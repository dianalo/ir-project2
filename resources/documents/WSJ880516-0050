In a document filed in federal court here, government investigators said they expect to make a determination by Aug. 1 about the merits of the allegations by the former employee, Roderick A. Stillwell. The document was filed in connection with a civil suit brought by Mr. Stillwell in March 1987 under the federal False Claims Act, which allows private suits against defense contractors on behalf of the government.    John E. Norden 2nd, a Justice Department attorney working on the case here, said the government filing was made in response to a request from a federal judge about the status of the case. The Justice Department has the option of taking over the suit, declining to participate or asking for a dismissal. &quot;The case is very complex, and it's too early to decide which way we'll go,&quot; Mr. Norden said.    A former subcontracts administrator at McDonnell Douglas, Mr. Stillwell initially charged in his suit that executives of the company's helicopter division allegedly schemed with executives of Cleveland-based Parker Hannifin Corp. to inflate costs on the Army's Apache helicopter program by $1.1 million. Mr. Stillwell also claimed that he was forced by McDonnell Douglas executives to resign after he reported cost discrepancies.    Mr. Stillwell expanded his charges in a court filing last November, claiming that the McDonnell Douglas unit allegedly engaged in widespread fraudulent billing in the helicopter unit, which is based in Mesa, Ariz. Some of the alleged violations date back to 1983, the year before McDonnell Douglas acquired the helicopter unit, formerly known as Hughes Helicopters Inc.    A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said the company &quot;continues to believe that the allegations in this case are without merit, and we are cooperating with the government in its review of the case.&quot; In Cleveland, officials of Parker Hannifin couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
