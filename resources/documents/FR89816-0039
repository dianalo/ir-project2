Many of thesestandards are design restrictive, and/or outdated, and must be supplementedby administrative action to permit the use of more recently developed PPEwhich provide equivalent or better protection. In addition, the existingstandards do not always provide clear requirements for the selection anduse of PPE.OSHA would delete, where appropriate, existing specification provisionsand use performance-oriented provisions to address hazards to the eyes,face, head and foot. The Agency would also update the general industryPPE standards, where appropriate, to provide clearer requirements and guidancefor the selection and use of PPE. The proposal would also add non-mandatoryappendices A and B to this subpart to address PPE for eye, face, head,and foot hazards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments on this proposed rulemaking and requests for ahearing must be postmarked by October 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments and requests for hearing should be sentto the Docket Officer, Docket No. S-060, U.S. Department of Labor, RoomN-2634, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. James Foster, Division ofInformation and Consumer Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor, OccupationalSafety and Health Administration, Room N-3647, 200 Constitution AvenueNW., Washington, DC 20210.

Background</ITAG>Sections 1910.132 through 1910.140 of subpart I, Personal Protective Equipment,were adopted by OSHA in 1971 from established Federal standards and nationalconsensus standards under section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct of 1970 (the Act) (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). Subpart I covers the use of personalprotective equipment (PPE), in general, and contains specific requirementsand criteria for eye and face protection, respiratory protection, headprotection, foot protection, and electrical protective devices. OSHA believesthat the existing standards for PPE in subpart I are outdated. The Agencyis addressing the need to update the regulation of respiratory protectionand electrical protective devices in separate rulemakings. The presentrulemaking is intended to update the requirements for eye, face, head andfoot protective devices. The existing standards reflect the knowledge andpractices regarding PPE as they existed in the late 1960's through early1970's. They specify very restrictive design criteria (thus limiting theuse of new technology), and contain gaps in coverage.OSHA is concerned that restraints on innovation make it more difficultfor employers either to increase acceptance of PPE or to provide more protectivePPE. Indeed, recognizing this likelihood, the Agency has already establisheda process under which OSHA has accepted, on a case-by-case basis, the useof eye protection which, while not designed to satisfy the existing standards,has been demonstrated through testing to provide equivalent or superiorworker protection. However, the Agency believes that this process cannotkeep pace with the development of improved PPE. Therefore, OSHA is concernedthat, unless the PPE standards are revised to be more performance-oriented,employers and product manufacturers will be discouraged from improvingtheir equipment and providing improved protection to workers.Since 1971, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has revisedits consensus standards for head, foot, and eye and face protection. OSHAproposes to use the most recent revisions of these standards as part ofthe basis for its rulemaking. For instance, OSHA has based its proposedrevision of the requirements for foot protection on ANSI Z41-1983, PersonnelProtection_Protective Footwear. This ANSI Standard, unlike the existingOSHA foot protection standard, covers foot protection for women as wellas for men. This proposed change would address a serious gap in coverageunder the existing standards. In addition, OSHA has obtained injury dataand technical reports which show that injuries are occurring to employeeswho are not wearing PPE, as well as to some employees who are wearing PPE.This would indicate that significant improvements in PPE design and acceptanceare needed. OSHA believes that the record developed in the course of thisrulemaking will enable the Agency to promulgate revised standards for PPEthat are more clearly written, more comprehensive, and more accuratelyreflect available technololgy. OSHA expects that compliance with the proposedrevisions will substantially reduce the risks to workers from the pertinenthazards.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Hazards Involved</ITAG>OSHA has determined that workers in a wide range of occupations are exposedto a significant risk of death or serious injury from being struck by variousobjects in the workplace. OSHA's accident data indicate that a significantportion of all work related injuries and fatalities involve workers beingstruck in the eyes, face, head or feet by foreign objects. Among the referenceswhich document this problem are the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) workinjury reports on eye, face, head and foot injuries; the BLS SupplementaryData System Information, the National Safety Council <T3>Accident Facts</T3>; the National Institute for Occupational Safetyand Health (NIOSH) studies of accident data; and, articles in trade journalsand safety magazines (References 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16,17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22). While these sources differ as to the number andkind of injuries, they are consistent in pointing out the high incidencesand severity of these accidents, and provide clear evidence of a significantrisk to workers.In 1981, disabling occupational injuries and illnesses to the head, eyes,face, and feet account for over 14 percent of the disabling occupationalinjuries reported through the Bureau of Labor Statistics SupplementaryData System. The BLS estimated that these disability injuries included116,000 eye injuries, 40,000 face injuries, 46,800 head injuries, and 156,400foot and toe injuries (Reference 5).The 1988 edition of <T3>Accident Facts</T3> estimated that, in 1987, there were 70,000 eyeinjuries, 70,000 head and face injuries, and 110,000 foot and toe injuries.Those injuries constituted 13.8 percent of the estimated 1,800,000 totaldisabling work injuries for 1987 (Reference 15).The Injury Surveillance Branch, Division of Safety Research, National Institutefor Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), relying on data received throughthe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, National Electronic InjurySurveillance System, reported 333,272 occupational eye injuries for 1985(Reference 8). The National Society to Prevent Blindness estimates that2,500 eye injuries occur in the workplace every working day, and that thecost to employers is $130 million per year (including medical costs andwage compensation) (Reference 9).A BLS Supplementary Data System (SDS) tabulation (all industries) of 18states reported that in 1983 37,379 injuries to the eyes, 16,366 injuriesto the face, 13,844 injuries to the head, and 59,970 injuries to the feetwere recorded as worker compensation cases. OSHA notes that each statehas its own requirements for the minimum number of days (ranging from oneto eight days) that a worker must be disabled before an injury gives riseto a worker compensation case. OSHA believes that this factor accountsfor the apparent minor discrepancy between the 1983 BLS data and the otherestimates for eye injuries. These injuries represent 12.7 percent of thetotal injuries reported (999,703) (Reference 10).OSHA has used the Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Injury Reports (WIR)on eye, face, foot and head injuries in determining what sorts of PPE-relatedinjuries workers experience (References 11, 12, 13, 14). (See injury tables,below. These tables are based on BLS surveys of injured workers, and donot reflect the universe of non-injured workers.)<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s10,5,5,5,5</C> <T4>Eye Injuries By Type of Accident, Selected States</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[July-August 1979]</ITAG><H1>Item</H1><H1>All workers (100%)</H1><H2>No. </H2><H2>Percent</H2><H1>Workers wearing eye protection (41%) </H1><H2>No. </H2><H2>Percent</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Total <D>1,052 </D><D>100 </D><D>435 </D><D>100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Flying or falling object struck worker <D>727 </D><D>69 </D><D>355 </D><D>82</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Struck non-moving object <D>21 </D><D>2 </D><D>5 </D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Liquid or chemical injured worker <D>216 </D><D>21 </D><D>59 </D><D>14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Occurred in another way <D>88 </D><D>8 </D><D>16 </D><D>4</D><F>(Workers not wearing eye protection=59 percent).</F><F/><T4>Note</T4>: This table does not reflect workers whose eye protectionprevented injuries.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,8,8</C><T4>Face Injuries By Type of Accident, Selected States </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[July-November 1979]</ITAG><H1>Item</H1><H1>No. of workers</H1><H1>Percent of workers</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Total <D>774 </D><D>100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Flying or falling objects struck worker <D>344 </D><D>44</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Struck non-moving object <D>48 </D><D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Liquid or chemical injured worker <D>35 </D><D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Swinging object struck face <D>154 </D><D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Object or tool was pulled into face <D>114 </D><D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Powered tool kicked back into face <D>33 </D><D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Occurred in other way <D>46 </D><D>6</D><F/><T4>Note</T4>: This table does not reflect workers whose face protectionprevented injuries.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Foot Injuries by Description of Accident, Selected States</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">July-August 1979</ITAG><H1> </H1><H2>Item</H2><H1>All workers (100%)</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><H1>Workers wearing safety shoes (23%)</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Total <D>1,251 </D><D>100 </D><D>283 </D><D>100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Stepped on sharp object <D>194 </D><D>16 </D><D>24 </D><D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Struck by falling object <D>721 </D><D>58 </D><D>191 </D><D>67</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Object rolled onto or over foot <D>168 </D><D>13 </D><D>36 </D><D>13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Squeezed between <D>59 </D><D>5 </D><D>13 </D><D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Struck foot against object <D>28 </D><D>2 </D><D>3 </D><D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Occurred in another way <D>81 </D><D>6 </D><D>16 </D><D>6</D><F/><T2>Note: </T2>This table does not reflect workers whose foot protectionprevented injuries.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s70,6,5,5,5</C><T4>Head Injuries by Description of Accident, Selected States</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">July-September 1979</ITAG><H1> </H1><H2>Item</H2><H1>All workers (100%)</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><H1>Workers wearing hard hats (16%)</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Total <D>1,033 </D><D>100 </D><D>170 </D><D>100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Head struck non-moving object <D>299 </D><D>29 </D><D>21 </D><D>12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Swinging object struck <D>198 </D><D>19 </D><D>44 </D><D>26</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Falling object struck head <D>371 </D><D>36 </D><D>62 </D><D>36</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Flying object struck head <D>120 </D><D>12 </D><D>34 </D><D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Occurred in another way <D>45 </D><D>4 </D><D>9 </D><D>5</D><F/><T2>Note: </T2>This table does not reflect workers whose head protectionprevented injuries.</ITAG></ITAG>A Work Injury Report (WIR) on eye injuries conducted by the BLS shows thatthree-fifths of the injured workers surveyed (1,052) were not wearing eyeprotection. Where injured workers were wearing eye protection, in 94 percentof the incidents, the harm was caused by materials which went around orunder the protector (Reference 11).Similar results are reported in the BLS WIR on face injuries. Virtuallyall of the injured workers (774) had not worn face protection. Of the nineworkers in the survey who were wearing face protection, five were injuredby materials which went around or under the protector, and in three casesthe protector was knocked off the worker by the impact of the object whichcaused the injury. The typical face injury was caused by flying or fallingblunt metal objects (Reference 12).The BLS WIR on head injuries shows that 84 percent of the injured workersstudied (1,033) were not wearing head protection. Where workers were wearingPPE, almost 70 percent received blows to an unprotected part of the head.Over one-third of the accidents resulted from falling objects strikingthe head. Three-tenths of the accidents occurred when workers struck anonmoving object and one-fifth occurred when a swinging object such asa steel bar, struck the head (Reference 13).Regarding foot injuries, the BLS WIR indicates that fewer than one-fourthof the injured workers (1,251) were wearing safety shoes or boots at thetime of the accident. Nearly three-fifths of the accidents resulted fromfalling objects striking the foot. Stepping on a sharp object, such asa nail, caused 16 percent of the injuries, and another 13 percent occurredwhen an object rolled over the foot (Reference 14).These BLS work injury reports on eye, face, head, and foot injuries (ReportNumbers 597, 604, 605, and 626) identify two major factors concerning thesetypes of injuries. Personal protective equipment is not being worn thevast majority of the time, and when the protective equipment is worn, itdoes not fully protect the worker. For instance, objects go around theprotector or strike an area for which the protector does not provide protection.OSHA believes that the proposal will address the problems identified inthe BLS reports by allowing new innovative designs through the use of performance-orientedlanguage, by providing information for selecting the proper protection,and by improving the protection afforded by the equipment. (For example,the current OSHA foot protection standard does not address penetrationresistance through the sole of a safety shoe, nor protection of areas ofthe foot other than the toe. OSHA intends through its new standards, togain an improvement in worker acceptance of wearing protective equipmentby allowing better and more comfortable designs not presently permittedby the current standards, and by providing information on selecting theproper equipment for the job.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary and Explanation of the Proposal</ITAG>OSHA proposes to revise subpart I of 29 CFR part 1910 to replace, whereappropriate, existing specification provisions with performance-orientedcriteria for eye, face, foot and head protection. OSHA would update thedesign requirements for PPE by revising the standards so they referencethe current edition of the pertinent ANSI standards. Requirements for PPEselection, care, use and training would appear in the body of the revisedstandard. As noted above, the proposed standard includes criteria for women'sprotective footwear, so that all protective footwear is covered. In addition,protection for the sole of the foot would be required when there is a riskof objects piercing the sole. Such protection is not provided in the currentOSHA PPE standards. Provisions have been added which address the selectionof PPE, defective and damaged equipment, reissued equipment, and training.The requirements of proposed subpart I, like those of current subpart I,would apply to all general industry places of employment. The proposalwould add several general requirements to andSection; 1910.132; would reviseandSection;andSection; 1910.133, 1910.135 and 1910.136; would reserve andSection;andSection;1910.138, 1910.139, and 1910.140; and would add appendices A and B to subpartI.The proposed format of part 1910, subpart I, would contain the followingsections:<ITAG tagnum="26">1910.132_General requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1910.133_Eye and face protection</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1910.134_Respiratory protection</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1910.135_Head protection</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1910.136_Foot protection</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1910.137_Electrical protective devices</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1910.138_Incorporation by reference [reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1910.139_[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1910.140_[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix A_References for further information</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="75">Appendix B_Compliance guidelines for hazard assessment and personalprotective equipment selection</ITAG>The provisions of the current subpart I standards, andSection;andSection; 1910.132through 1910.140, would be revised, deleted or retained as set forth inthe following table:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>  <H1>Current standard </H1><H1>Proposed standard</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.132(a) <D>andSection;1910.132(a)* </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.132(b) <D>andSection;1910.132(b)* </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.132(c) <D>andSection;1910.132(c)* </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(1) <D>andSection;1910.133(a)(1) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(2)(i) <D>andSection;1910.133(b) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(2)(ii) <D>andSection;1910.133(a)(2) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(2)(iii) <D>andSection;1910.133(a)(2) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(2)(iv) <D>andSection;1910.133(b) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(2)(v) <D>andSection;1910.133(f) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(2)(vi) <D>andSection;1910.133(f) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(2)(vii) <D>andSection;1910.133(e) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(3)(i) <D>andSection;1910.133(a)(4) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(3)(ii) <D>andSection;1910.133(a)(4) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(3)(iii) <D>andSection;1910.133(a)(4) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(4) <D>andSection;1910.133(b)(1) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(5) <D>andSection;1910.132(g) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.133(a)(6) <D>andSection;1910.133(b) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.134 <D>andSection;1910.134* </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.135 <D>andSection;1910.135(b) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.136 <D>andSection;1910.136(b) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.137 <D>andSection;1910.137* </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.138 <D>None (reserved) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.139 <D>None (reserved) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection;1910.140 <D>None (reserved) </D><F>*The current requirements for these paragraphs and sections are notproposed for revision in this proposal and will remain unchanged by thisrulemaking.</F></ITAG></ITAG> In addition to these sections, OSHA proposes to add non-mandatory appendicesA and B, which provide references for further information for complianceassistance, and information for hazard assessment and PPE selection, respectively.As discussed previously, the existing PPE standards reference obsoletenational consensus standards. In their place, OSHA has referenced the currentnational consensus standards in the proposed standard. In the years sincethe Agency promulgated part 1910, OSHA's general policy has been to useits rulemaking proceedings to delete any references to national consensusstandards and to incorporate, where appropriate, the pertinent regulatorytext into the OSHA standards. OSHA has set this policy because the Agencybelieves that the compliance burden is most reasonable when employers andemployees have all of the requirements which apply to them in the bodyof the OSHA standards as published by the Agency, without having to trackdown referenced documents. However, OSHA notes that in the case of PPEdesign requirements, neither employers nor employees are directly concernedwith the detailed design requirements or test methods. They are concernedonly that the equipment satisfies the pertinent OSHA Standards. OSHA furthernotes that it is universal practice for PPE manufacturers to determine(usually by testing) that their equipment meets the ANSI design requirementsand, then, to advertise and mark their products as meeting the applicablestandard. OSHA has determined that compliance with the design requirements in thecurrent editions of the national consensus standards for head, foot, eyeand face protection would provide a proper level of protection. Therefore,OSHA proposes to incorporate by reference those standards for the PPE designrequirements since, as discussed previously, these requirements are notnormally used by employers or employees, but rather by manufacturers ofPPE. The provisions affected by these incorporations by reference, andSection;andSection;1910.133(a)(6),1910.135, and 1910.136, are discussed in more detail below. OSHA proposesto include the provisions that address PPE selection, care, use and trainingwith the revised regulatory text. In the early 1970's, the National Institute for Occupational Safety andHealth tested various types of personal protective equipment and foundthat a number of them did not meet the OSHA Standards (by failing to meetthe design and test requirements in the referenced American National Standards).This identified a possible need for third-party certification similar tothat required in the OSHA Standards for respirators (NIOSH Certification),and electrical equipment (UL listing). More recently, the Safety EquipmentInstitute has met with OSHA to explain the benefits of their third-partycertification program, and has encouraged OSHA to consider a requirementfor certification of PPE. There are advantages and disadvantages to third-party certification. Themain disadvantage is that it could result in substantial costs to manufacturerssince they would normally have to contract for services from a recognizedtesting laboratory. However, one advantage is that PPE which is advertisedas meeting certain criteria would be tested (and certified) to ensure thatthe PPE does, in fact, meet that criteria. Another advantage is that third-party certification would include a follow-upinspection service to periodically test PPE to ensure continued compliancewith specified criteria. OSHA requests comments and information on whether or not OSHA should includea requirement in the PPE standards that employers obtain third-party certificationthat their PPE meets the applicable OSHA requirements. While the currentOSHA standards do not require certification, there are several certificationprograms currently in place (such as those administered by the Safety EquipmentInstitute and the Footwear Industries of America) which are being utilizedby equipment manufacturers. Is certification of PPE necessary to ensurethat head, foot, eye and face PPE meets OSHA standards? What would be thecosts and benefits of certification, if such a requirement were added?In accordance with paragraph 6(b)(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 655), theAgency has reviewed the various national consensus standards that coverworking conditions addressed in this proposal. OSHA has incorporated appropriateprovisions from those national consensus standards as part of this proposal.OSHA believes that the proposed standard will better effectuate the purposesof the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 than the national consensusstandards which have not been made a part of this proposal, because thisproposal is more comprehensive, provides greater flexibility in its requirementsfor safety, and provides for public participation and comment. The revision of these general industry PPE Standards will be coordinatedwith efforts to revise parallel provisions in the Shipyard Employment andConstruction Standards so that consistent coverage of hazards which areencountered in these industry sectors can be provided. The following discussion provides a more detailed explanation of the proposedprovisions related to personal protective equipment. Section 1910.132 General Requirements Existing paragraphs (a) through (c) of andSection;1910.132 are not proposedfor revision in this rulemaking. Existing paragraph (a) requires that protectiveequipment be provided, used and maintained in sanitary and reliable condition,as necessary, to protect employees from workplace hazards. Existing paragraph(b) requires that, where employees provide their own equipment, the employerassure the adequacy, including the proper maintenance and sanitation, ofsuch equipment. Existing paragraph (c) requires that all personal protectiveequipment be of safe design and construction for the work to be performed.Proposed paragraph (d) of andSection;1910.132 would be added to address theselection of personal protective equipment (PPE). The current standardsdo not contain a similar provision. This proposed provision would requireemployers to select the PPE for their employees based on an assessmentof the hazards in the workplace and the hazards which employees are likelyto encounter. Because OSHA is aware that some employees are responsiblefor obtaining their own PPE, the proposed provision requires employersto inform their employees of the selection decisions and ensure, regardlessof who obtains it, that the correct PPE is, in fact, obtained. This provisionis based on current andSection;1910.133(a)(1), which covers eye and faceprotection, but the provision has been expanded so that it covers selectionof all personal protective equipment. Proposed paragraph (e), a new requirement, prohibits the use of defectiveor damaged PPE. This provision is based, in part, on andSection;1910.133(a)(2)(vii)of the existing standard, which states that protectors should be kept cleanand in good repair. Under the proposed paragraph, this requirement wouldcover all PPE. Proposed paragraph (f) is a new requirement that would require employeesto be trained in the proper use of their personal protective equipment.This paragraph is based on existing andSection;1910.134(b)(3) that requirestraining for respirator use and has been expanded to cover all PPE. OSHAproposes this requirement because the Bureau of Labor Statistics Work InjuryReports indicated that a significant number of the employees injured hadnot received training in the proper use of PPE (References 11, 12, 13,and 14). Section 1910.133 Eye and Face Protection Under proposed paragraph (a)(1), employers must ensure that employees useappropriate eye and face protection when they are exposed to eye or facehazards from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, chemicalgases or vapors, or potentially injurious light radiation. The only significantdifference between proposed paragraph (a)(1) and existing paragraph (a)(1)is that the term ``liquids'' would be replaced by the terms ``molten metal''and ``liquid chemicals'' in the list of hazards for which eye and faceprotection are required. OSHA believes it is appropriate to specify thatmolten metal is covered to prevent confusion over whether or not moltenmetal is a ``liquid.'' Also, proposed paragraph (a)(1) replaces the general requirement for ``suitable''eye protection with the requirement that eye protection used by employeesprovide both front and side protection from flying objects. OSHA notes,for example, that eye protection with side shields or molded wrap-aroundlenses and frames, would satisfy this requirement. The proposed revisionis based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Injury Report on eye injurieswhich identified that in cases where eye protection was used, 94 percentof the incidents occurred when an object (or chemical) went around theprotection (Reference 11). OSHA requests comments on the need for thisrevision, including information on the extent to which employers are alreadyproviding eye protection which satisfies the proposed requirement and anyadditional costs which would be involved in obtaining eye protection whichmeets the proposed requirement. Existing andSection; 1910.133 is based on ANSI Z87.1-1968, section 4. Existingparagraph (a)(1) of andSection; 1910.133 contains a general provision torequire eye and face protection where such use could prevent probable injuries.This provision is so general that it is difficult to determine what isrequired. Therefore, we are proposing to make andSection;1910.133(a)(1) morespecific to better clarify when eye and face protection are required. ExistingandSection; 1910.133(a)(1) also requires that suitable eye and face protectionbe made conveniently available; and, that unprotected persons not be knowinglysubjected to hazards. These two provisions are being deleted from proposedandSection; 1910.133(a)(1) since they are already addressed elsewhere inthis proposed standard (existing andSection; 1910.132(a) and proposed andSection;1910.132(d)).Proposed paragraph (a)(2), requires that eye and face protective equipmentfit employees properly. The proposed requirement is based on existing andSection;1910.133 (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii), as well as on ANSI Z87.1-1989, section7.4. OSHA believes that the proposed simplified requirement will provideemployers with the appropriate guidance so they can assure good visionand proper eye protection for employees. The Agency has not retained existingparagraph (a)(2)(i) in the proposed rule, because that provision's requirementfor PPE which provides ``adequate protection'' would be covered by proposedparagraph (a)(1).In addition, existing andSection; 1910.133(a)(2)(iv), which requires protectorsto ``be durable'', is proposed to be removed since the intent of the existingprovision is now covered by proposed andSection; 1910.132(e), which prohibitsdefective or damaged PPE from being used, and by proposed andSection; 1910.133(b),which covers the design requirements for eye and face protection.Existing andSection; 1910.133 (a)(2)(v) and (a)(2)(vi) which require protectorsto ``be capable of being disinfected'' and ``be easily cleanable,'' areproposed to be removed since they are redundant to duties already imposedby andSection; 1910.132(a) of the existing standard.Existing andSection; 1910.133(a)(2)(vii), which recommends that protectors``be kept clean and in good repair,'' is proposed to be removed since itis not a mandatory requirement and does not belong in the standard. Theintent of the recommendations is covered by proposed andSection; 1910.132(e).Proposed paragraph (a)(3) adds a new requirement_that workers who passfrom well-lit to dimly-lit areas not wear protectors with tinted, or variabletinted lenses. This provision would reduce the likelihood that extremelighting changes will temporarily impair an employee's vision, such aswhen a forklift operator drives a forklift from the outdoors into a poorlylit warehouse. OSHA solicits comments regarding the need for and suitabilityof this proposed requirement, with emphasis on the extent to which wearingtinted lenses in these situations actually adds to the recognized visionproblem caused by dim lighting.Proposed paragraph (a)(4), which is based on existing andSection; 1910.133(a)(3),requires that employees who wear prescription lenses be protected by eyeprotection that incorporates the prescription in its design or by eye protectionthat can be worn over prescription lenses without interfering with theprescription lenses such that vision becomes impaired, or when protectionis not fully provided because of interference.Existing andSection; 1910.133(a)(4), which requires that ``every protectorshall be distinctly marked to facilitate identification only of the manufacturer,''is proposed to be removed since a marking to identify the manufacturerof eye and face protection does not add or detract from the safety affordedby the protector. ANSI Z87.1-1989, which is proposed to be incorporatedby reference, contains this same requirement. However, the deletion ofthis requirement by the proposal, would supersede this ANSI requirement.Existing andSection; 1910.133(a)(5), which requires that ``limitations orprecautions'' provided by the manufacturer ``be transmitted to the userand care be taken to see that such limitations and precautions are strictlyobserved,'' is proposed to be removed. The intent of the existing provisionis now covered by proposed andSection; 1910.132(f), which requires employeesto be trained in the proper use of their PPE, and by proposed appendixB which provides compliance guidelines for selection of PPE.Proposed paragraph (a)(5), a new provision, requires that employees potentiallyexposed to injurious radiant energy, such as that produced by welding,use eye protection with filter lenses which have a shade number appropriatefor the work being performed. In addition, this proposed provision includesa list of the proper shade numbers for various operations. Existing andSection;1910.133(a)(1) requires protection from potentially injurious light radiation.OSHA has determined, however, that the proposed provision states the requirementsmore clearly.In paragraph (b), OSHA proposes that the design requirements for eye andface protection comply with the provisions of ANSI Z87.1-1989, or be ofa design that provides equivalent protection.Currently, the requirements for the design of eye and face protection arefound in andSection; 1910.133(a)(6), which references the 1968 edition ofANSI Z87.1. Proposed paragraph (b) merely updates the ANSI reference forthe design of eye and face protection to reflect the current (1989) edition.The design criteria contained in the 1989 edition of ANSI Z87.1 are muchmore performance-oriented than those in the existing OSHA standard, andcan be met by eye and face protection currently in use in general industry.The 1989 edition of ANSI Z87.1 that OSHA proposes to incorporate by referencecontains design criteria for plano spectacles, as well as criteria andtest methods for: Optical performance; transmittance impact, flammability;corrosive resistance for metal parts; and, cleanability.<T3>Section 1910.135 Head Protection </T3>Proposed paragraph (a)(1), mandates that employers require their employeeswear protective helmets when they are working where there is a potentialfor injury to the head from falling or moving objects. This language, basedon existing andSection; 1910.132(a), has been revised to clarify when headprotection is required.Proposed paragraph (a)(2) requires that employees who are near exposedenergized conductors which their heads could contact must wear helmetsdesigned for protection from electrical shock hazards. This provision,based on existing andSection;andSection; 1910.132(a) and 1910.135, would clarifywhen electrical protective type helmets must be worn.Proposed paragraph (b) requires that the design of protective helmets complywith the provisions of ANSI Z89.1-1986, ``Requirements for Protective Headwearfor Industrial Workers,'' (Reference 2) or be of a design that providesequivalent protection. ANSI Z89.1-1986 covers impact resistance, penetrationprotection, flammability, water absorption resistance, electrical insulationand maximum weight. The existing OSHA standard for head protection, andSection;1910.135, references ANSI Z89.1-1969 (Reference 26). This earlier edition,except insofar as it addresses electrical insulation for Class B helmets,sets essentially the same requirements as would apply through the proposedparagraph (b) reference to ANSI Z89.1-1986. A significant difference betweenthe helmet provisions referenced in proposed paragraph (b) and the presentOSHA requirements involves the relevant testing for helmets used for protectionagainst live electrical conductors. The testing requirements in the 1986ANSI standard are somewhat more stringent for ``Class B'' helmets thanthose referenced in the current OSHA standards. However, OSHA believesthat helmets currently used for protection against electrical contact ingeneral industry meet the electrical insulation requirements in ANSI Z89.1-1986.The effect of this change in testing requirements involves only a smallnumber of employees, primarily linemen and tree trimmers, who generallywear helmets which are classified under the ANSI standard as ``Class B''helmets. The Agency solicits comments and information on helmets presentlyused for electrical protection in general industry, and whether such helmetswould comply with the proposed OSHA standards.Currently, OSHA does not have any requirements for ``bump caps'' (a typeof headwear that is intended to provide head protection from minor impactand protection from cuts and scrapes). Should OSHA include requirementsfor the use and design of ``bump caps''? Are there any voluntary or consensusstandards for ``bump caps''? What would be the economic and safety impactif OSHA added requirements for the use and design of ``bump caps''? Howshould OSHA target the use of bump caps to determine when or when not theyare needed?<T3>Section 1910.136 Foot Protection</T3>Proposed paragraph (a) requires employers to ensure that their employeeswear protective footwear when they are working in areas where there isa danger of foot injuries due to falling and rolling objects, or objectspiercing the sole. In substance, the same general requirement is containedin existing andSection; 1910.132(a). This proposed language, however, clarifiesthe circumstances where foot protection would be required. The currentOSHA standard for foot protection, andSection; 1910.136, references ANSIZ41.1-1967, which has been superseded by ANSI Z41-1983. The 1967 editionof ANSI Z41.1 did not set requirements for sole puncture resistance, whereasthe current ANSI Z41-1983 standard does. The Bureau of Labor Statistics'Work Injury Report (WIR) on foot injuries (Reference 14) indicates thatobjects piercing the sole accounted for 16 percent of foot injuries toall workers in the survey, and eight percent for those workers in the surveywho were wearing safety shoes. Therefore, OSHA is proposing that footwear,in addition to protecting employees from falling or rolling objects, protectthem from sole punctures. The Agency solicits comments and informationon the extent to which employers or employees are arranging for the availabilityand use of protective footwear which meets the proposed requirement. OSHAalso seeks information on any additional costs involved in obtaining footprotection which meets the proposed requirement.In paragraph (b), OSHA proposes that the design of protective footwearcomply with the provisions of ANSI Z41-1983 (Reference 3) or be of a designthat provides equivalent protection. The provisions in ANSI Z41-1983 covercompression resistance, impact resistance and puncture resistance. ExistingandSection; 1910.136, through its reference to the 1967 edition, sets compressionand impact requirements, which are the same as those in ANSI Z41-1983.However, as noted above, the 1967 edition applied only to men's protectivefootwear. ANSI Z41-1983 covers both men's and women's protective footwear,thus filling a gap in the current OSHA standard for protective footwear.OSHA believes that protective footwear which complies with the ANSI Z41.1-1967standard would also comply with the ANSI Z41-1983 requirements for compressionand impact resistance. As discussed above, puncture resistance was notcovered in the ANSI Z41.1-1967 standard.<ITAG tagnum="81"/><T3>Appendices A and B to Subpart I</T3>As discussed above, OSHA proposes to add non-mandatory appendices A andB to subpart I to provide a list of references for further informationwhich may be useful in implementing this standard, and to provide complianceguidelines on hazard assessment and personal protective equipment selection.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.

Preliminary Regulatory Impact Assessment and Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis</ITAG>IntroductionOSHA adopted its current standards for personal protective equipment (PPE)from National Consensus Standards under section 6(a) of the OSH Act. Inthe nearly two decades that have passed since these standards were developed,a number of advances have been made in PPE technology. Thus, OSHA is proposingto revise this workplace standard in order to reflect these improved meansof hazard prevention.Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13197) requires that a regulatory impact analysisbe prepared for any proposed regulation that meets the criteria for a ``majorrule''; that is, that would be likely to result in an annual impact onthe economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in cost or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local governmentagencies, or geographic regions; or, significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets. In addition, the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 60, <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires an analysis of whether a regulation will havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Consistent with these requirements, OSHA has prepared this PreliminaryRegulatory Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for the proposedrevisions to the PPE standard. As a result of this analysis OSHA has madea preliminary determination that the proposed revision to the PPE regulationswill not constitute a major rule.<T3>Affected Industries and Current Use</T3>Based on a preliminary report prepared by Eastern Research Group [1] OSHAhas determined that virtually all industries covered by the General IndustryStandards will be affected by these revisions. The extent of the impactwill vary by industry depending on the hazards, the types of occupationsand the current practice regarding PPE use. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics(BLS) groups employment into seven major occupational categories, of whichtwo: (1) Construction, operating, maintenance and material handling and(2) agriculture, forestry, fishing and related activities are assumed toinclude most of the occupations covered by this proposal. These two employmentgroups have been used as an estimate of the population-at-risk. Table I-1presents estimates of the number of establishments, total employment andpopulation-at-risk, by affected industry.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>I-1.<T4>_Establishments and Employment

There are, however, very little statistical data available thatwould allow a determination of the number of employees who either are usingPPE, or who should be wearing PPE by virtue of the hazards to which theyare exposed. OSHA's inspection data shows that approximately 3.5 percent of all plannedsafety inspections result in a citation under the existing PPE standard.What is not shown by these data is the degree of hazard present at theseworkplaces, the number of workers exposed to the hazard, or the type ofPPE required. Several Work Injury Report (WIR) published by the BLS cover a number ofspecific industries or types of injuries. These reports, which examineonly those cases where a worker was injured, indicate that many workersare not wearing PPE or are wearing inadequate PPE. Of the approximately22 million workers at risk, OSHA estimates that about 12.8 percent or 2.8million workers are not wearing the appropriate PPE (See chapter II offull analysis). OSHA also estimates that relatively few firms have performeda formal hazard assessment of the potential hazards in their workplace.Also, OSHA assumes that many workers are not wearing PPE or are wearinginadequate PPE due to a lack of training regarding the importance of usingthis equipment. Nonregulatory Environment The primary objective of OSHA's proposed revisions to the PPE standardis to reduce the number of employee injuries and deaths resulting fromnonuse of PPE or use of inappropriate PPE. OSHA believes that the presentrisk to employees is too high and that the proposed revisions will preventa substantial number of these injuries and fatalities. OSHA examined thenonregulatory approaches for promoting adequate levels of PPE use including(1) economic forces generated by the private market system, (2) incentivescreated by Workers' Compensation programs or the threat of private suits,and (3) related activities of private agencies. As a result of this review,OSHA has determined that the need for government regulation arises fromthe significant risk of job-related injury or death caused by the inadequaterate of optional private hazard-abatement expenditure. Private marketsfail to provide enough safety and health resources due to the lack of riskinformation, the immobility of labor, and the externalization of part ofthe social costs of worker injuries and deaths. Workers' Compensation systemsdo not offer an adequate remedy because the premiums do not reflect specificworkplace risk, and liability claims are restricted by state statutes preventingemployees from suing their employers. While certain voluntary standardsexist, their scope and approach fail to provide adequate protection forall workers. Thus, OSHA has determined that a federal standard is necessary.Costs of Compliance Under both the existing and proposed standards there are requirements toprovide PPE wherever there are hazards present in the workplace. OSHA estimatesthat the incremental cost to comply with the revised rule would be approximately$28.3 million annually. The annualized cost of training in the proper useof PPE is expected to be $13.9 million per year and the annualized costof the requirement to conduct a hazard assessment is estimated to be $13.8million per year assuming a reassessment is conducted once every five years.Using alternative assumptions regarding the frequency of the reassessmentof either an initial assessment followed by annual reassessments or a reassessmentevery ten years resulted in estimated costs of $19.4 and $9.8 million respectively.Table I-2 presents the aggregate cost estimates by provision for each majorindustry group. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>8,L2,i1,s100,12,12,12,12,12,12,12</C><T4>Table I-</T4>2._<T4>Summary of Aggregate Compliance Costs </T4><H1>Major industry group</H1><H1>1910.132(a)</H1><H2>Provision of PPE</H2><H1>1910.132(d)</H1><H2>Hazard assessment</H2><H1>1910.132(g)</H1><H2>PPE training</H2><H1>1910.133(a)(1)</H1><H2>Sideshields</H2><H1>Total compliance costs</H1><H2>Proposed standard</H2><H2>Existing standard</H2><H2>Incremental costs</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Landscape and horticulural services, forestry, and fisheries<D>$1,090,011</D><D>$1,021,816</D><D>$419,036</D><D>$8,093</D><D>$2,538,957</D><D>$1,090,011</D><D>$1,448,946</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Oil and gas extraction <D>1,660,095</D><D>169,111</D><D>91,507</D><D>4,645</D><D>1,925,359</D><D>1,660,095</D><D>265,263</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Manufacturing<D>40,723,673</D><D>4,671,996</D><D>6,910,023</D><D>433,721</D><D>52,739,412</D><D>40,723,673</D><D>12,015,739</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transportation, communication, utilities<D>6,637,128</D><D>1,712,609</D><D>1,469,490</D><D>72,300</D><D>9,891,526</D><D>6,637,128</D><D>3,254,398</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Wholesale trade<D>4,890,006</D><D>4,381,144</D><D>1,130,399</D><D>14,761</D><D>10,416,310</D><D>4,890,006</D><D>5,526,304</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Retail trade<D>3,636,204</D><D>749,492</D><D>1,583,219</D><D>10,553</D><D>5,979,467</D><D>3,636,204</D><D>2,343,263</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Finance, insurance, real estate<D>833,375</D><D>249,101</D><D>250,395</D><D>2,419</D><D>1,335,291</D><D>833,375</D><D>501,915</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Services<D>5,808,593</D><D>823,291</D><D>2,036,008</D><D>13,793</D><D>8,681,686</D><D>5,808,593</D><D>2,873,093</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Totals<D>65,279,087</D><D>13,778,560</D><D>13,890,077</D><D>560,284</D><D>93,508,008</D><D>65,279,087</D><D>28,228,921</D><F> Source: U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory Analysis.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Assessment of Hazards and BenefitsFull compliance with the existing or proposed standards is expected toreduce the incidence of certain types of workplace injuries and fatalities.OSHA's injury analysis has focused primarily on head, eye, face, hand andfoot injuries as the ones most likely to be affected by PPE use. OSHA estimatesthat, annually, there are approximately 411,000 non-fatal injuries thatmay be related to PPE use among the population of workers covered by thestandard. Based on a review of the available data, OSHA estimates thatapproximately 82,200 could be prevented by full compliance with the existingstandard and that an additional 41,000 could be prevented by full compliancewith the proposed standard. In addition, OSHA estimates that 6 fatalitiesper year, which result from head injuries, could be prevented by full compliancewith either the existing or proposed standards.The standard has performance-oriented provisions which address eye, face,head and foot hazards and allows employers to adopt the most up-to-datePPE for use in their establishments. The flexibility to substitute newmaterial and technologies should produce more comfortable and protectivePPE. An increase in worker acceptance and use of PPE will translate intoadditional benefits. While the improvement in the level of benefits isdifficult to quantify, the expectation is that increased use of betterequipment will prevent or lessen the severity of many accidents to theeye, face, head or foot.Economic Impact and Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisOSHA has assessed the potential economic impact of the proposed PPE standardand has made a preliminary determination that none of the major industrygroups would experience a significant economic burden as a result of theproposed standard. If all of the costs are passed through to the consumer,OSHA estimates that the average price increase would be 0.001 percent,based on the ratio of compliance costs to the value of industry shipments.The maximum price increase in any industry would be 0.06 percent.On the other hand, if all costs were absorbed by the affected firms, OSHAestimates that the maximum reduction in profits would be less than 0.03percent. OSHA, therefore, expects that the proposed standard will not havea significant economic impact. OSHA also determined that the proposed standardwould not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small firms.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Finding of No Significant ImpactThis proposed rule and its major alternatives have been reviewed in accordancewith the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Guidelines of the Council on Environmental Quality(40 CFR parts 1500 through 1517), and the Department of Labor's NEPA Procedures(29 CFR part 11). As a result of this review, the Assistant Secretary forOSHA has determined that the proposed rule will have no significant environmentalimpact.The proposed revisions and additions to 29 CFR part 1910, Subpart I_PersonalProtective Equipment, focus on the reduction of accidents or injuries bymeans of personal protective equipment, proper selection and use, and training.The proposal also contains language, and format changes. These revisionsdo not impact on air, water, or soil quality, plant or animal life, theuse of land, or other aspects of the environment. Therefore, these revisionsare categorized as excluded actions according to subpart B, section 11.10,of the DOL NEPA regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Recordkeeping</ITAG>This proposal contains no recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Federalism</ITAG>This proposed standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12612 (52 FR 41685, Oct. 30, 1987) regarding Federalism. This Order requiresthat agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting state policyoptions, consult with states prior to taking any actions that would restrictstate policy options, and take such actions only when there is clear constitutionalauthority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order providesfor preemption of state law only if there is a clear Congressional intentfor the agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extentpossible.Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expressesCongress' clear intent to preempt state laws relating to issues with respectto which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards.Under the OSH Act, a state can avoid preemption only if it submits, andobtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of such standardsand their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developedby such Plan-States must, among other things, be at least as effectivein providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment asthe Federal standards.The federally proposed personal protective equipment standard is draftedso that employees in every state would be protected by general, performance-orientedstandards. To the extent that there are state or regional peculiaritiescaused by the terrain, the climate, or other factors, states with occupationalsafety and health plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act wouldbe able to develop their own state standards to address any special problems.Moreover, the performance nature of this proposed standard, of and by itself,allows for flexibility by states and employers to provide as much safetyas possible using varying methods consonant with conditions in each state.In short, there is a clear national problem related to occupational safetyand health related to personal protective equipment. While the individualstates, if all acted, might be able collectively to deal with the safetyproblems involved, most have not elected to do so in the seventeen yearssince the enactment of the OSH Act. Those states which have elected toparticipate under section 18 of the OSH Act would not be preempted by thisproposed regulation, and would be able to address special, local conditionswithin the framework provided by this performance-oriented standard, whileensuring that their standards are at least as effective as the Federalstandard. State comments are invited on this proposal, and will be fullyconsidered prior to promulgation of a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Public Participation </ITAG>Interested persons are requested to submit written data, views and argumentswith respect to this proposal. These comments must be postmarked by October16, 1989, and submitted in quadruplicate to the Docket Office, Docket No.S-060, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N-2634, Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210. The data, views and arguments that are submitted will be available forpublic inspection and copying at the above address. All timely submissionsreceived will be made a part of this proceeding. In addition, under section 6(b)(3) of the OSH Act and 29 CFR 1911.11, interestedpersons may file objections to the proposal and request an informal hearing.The objections and hearing requests should be submitted in quadruplicateto the Docket Office at the above address and must comply with the followingconditions: 1. The objections and hearing requests must include the name and addressof the individual or organization making the objection or request; 2. The objections and hearing requests must be postmarked by October 16,1989. 3. The objections and hearing requests must specify with particularitythe provisions of the proposed rule to which objection is taken or aboutwhich the hearing request is made, and must state the grounds; therefore4. Each objection and hearing request must be separately stated and numbered;and 5. The objections and hearing requests must be accompanied by a detailedsummary of the evidence proposed to be adduced at the requested hearing.Interested persons who have objections to various provisions or have changesto recommend may, of course, make these objections or recommendations intheir comments; OSHA will fully consider them. There is only need to fileformal ``objections'' separately if the interested person desires to requestan oral hearing. OSHA recognizes that there may be interested persons who, through theirknowledge of safety or their experience in the operations involved, wouldwish to endorse or support certain provisions in the standard. OSHA welcomessuch supportive comments, including any pertinent accident data or costinformation which may be available, in order that the record of this rulemakingwill present a balanced picture of the public response on the issues involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">X.

It should be theresponsibility of the safety officer to apply common sense and fundamentaltechnical principles to accomplish these tasks. This process is somewhatsubjective by nature, because of the infinite variety of situations wherePPE may be required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Assessment guidelines.</T3> In order to assess the need for PPE thefollowing steps should be taken:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Survey.</T3> Conduct a walk-through survey of the areas in question.The purpose of the survey is to identify sources of hazards to the feet,head, eyes and face of workers and co-workers. Consideration should begiven to the basic hazard categories:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(a) Impact</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(b) Penetration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(c) Compression (roll-over)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(d) Chemical</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(e) Heat</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(f) Harmful dust</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">(g) Light (optical) radiation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Sources.</T3> During the walk-through survey the safety officer shouldobserve: (a) Sources of motion; i.e., machinery or processes where anymovement of tools, machine elements or particles could exist, or movementof personnel that could result in collision with stationary objects; (b)sources of high temperatures that could result in burns, eye injury orignition of protective equipment, etc.; (c) types of chemical exposures;(d) sources of harmful dust; (e) sources of light radiation, i.e., welding,brazing, cutting, furnaces, heat treating, high intensity lights, etc.;(f) sources of falling objects or potential for dropping objects; (g) sourcesof sharp objects which might pierce the feet; (h) sources of rolling orpinching objects which could crush the feet; (i) layout of workplace andlocation of co-workers; and (j) any electrical hazards. In addition, injury/accidentdata should be reviewed to help identify problem areas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Organize data.</T3> Following the walk-through survey, it is necessaryto organize the data and information for use in the assessment of hazards.The objective is to prepare for an analysis of the hazards in the environmentto enable proper selection of protective equipment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Analyze data.</T3> Having gathered and organized data on a workplace,an estimate of the potential for foot, head, eye and face injuries shouldbe made. Each of the basic hazards (paragraph 3.a.) should be reviewedand a determination made as to the type and level of risk from each ofthe hazards found in the area. The possibility of exposure to several hazardssimultaneously should be considered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. <T3>Selection guidelines.</T3> After completion of the procedures in paragraph3, the general procedure for selection of protective equipment is to: (a)Become familiar with the potential hazards and the type of protective equipmentthat is available, and what it can do; i.e., splash protection, impactprotection, etc.; (b) compare the hazards associated with the environment;i.e., impact velocities, masses, projectile shape, radiation intensities,with the capabilities of the available protective equipment; (c) selectthe protective equipment which ensures a level of protection greater thanthe minimum required to protect employees from the hazards; and (d) fitthe user with the protective device and give instructions on care and useof the PPE. It is very important that end users be made aware of all warninglabels for and limitations of their PPE.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Fitting the device. </T3>Consideration must be given to comfort andfit. PPE that fits poorly will not afford the necessary protection. Continuedwearing of the device is more likely if it fits the wearer comfortably.Protective devices are generally available in a variety of sizes. Careshould be taken to ensure that the right size is selected.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Devices with adjustable features. </T3>Adjustments should be made onan individual basis for a comfortable fit that will maintain the protectivedevice in the proper position. Particular care should be taken in fittingdevices for eye protection against dust and chemical splash to ensure thatthe devices are sealed to the face. In addition, proper fitting of hardhats is important to ensure that the hard hat will not fall off duringwork operations. In some cases a chin strap may be necessary to keep thehard hat on an employee's head. (Chin straps should break at a reasonablylow force, however, so as to prevent a strangulation hazard.) Where manufacturer'sinstructions are available, they should be followed carefully.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Reassessment of hazards. </T3>It is the responsibility of the safetyofficer to reassess the workplace hazard situation as necessary, by identifyingand evaluating new equipment and processes, reviewing accident records,and reevaluating the suitability of previously selected PPE.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Selection chart guidelines for eye and face protection. </T3>Some occupations(not a complete list) for which eye protection should be considered are:Carpenters, electricians, machinists, mechanics and repairers, millwrights,plumbers and pipefitters, sheet metal workers and tinsmiths, assemblers,sanders, grinding machine operators, lathe and milling machine operators,sawyers, welders, laborers, chemical process operators and handlers, andtimber cutting and logging workers.

Adequate protectionagainst the highest level of each of the hazards should be provided. Protectivedevices do not provide unlimited protection. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Operations involving heat may also involve light radiation. Asrequired by the standard, protection from both hazards must be provided.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Faceshields should only be worn over primary eye protection (spectaclesor goggles). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) As required by the standard, filter lenses shall meet the requirementsfor shade designations in andSection;1910.133(a)(5). Tinted and shaded lensesare not filter lenses unless they are marked or identified as such. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) As required by the standard, persons whose vision requires theuse of prescription (Rx) lenses shall wear either protective devices fittedwith prescription (Rx) lenses or protective devices designed to be wornover regular prescription (Rx) eyewear. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) As required by the standard, wearers of contact lenses shall alsobe required to wear appropriate eye and face protection devices in a hazardousenvironment. It should be recognized that dusty and/or chemical environmentsmay represent an addition hazard to contact lens wearers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) Caution should be exercised in the use of metal frame protectivedevices in electrical hazard areas. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(8) Atmospheric conditions and the restricted ventilation of the protectorcan cause lenses to fog. Frequent cleansing may be necessary. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(9) Welding helmets or faceshields should be used only over primaryeye protection (spectacles or goggles). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(10) Non-sideshield spectacles are available for frontal protectiononly, but are not acceptable eye protection for the sources and operationslisted for ``impact.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(11) Ventilation should be adequate, but well protected from splashentry. Eye and face protection should be designed and used so that it providesboth adequate ventilation and protects the wearer from splash entry. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(12) Protection from light radiation is directly related to filterlens density. See note (4). Select the darkest shade that allows task performance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. <T3>Selection guidelines for foot protection. </T3>Safety shoes and bootswhich meet the ANSI Z41 Standard provide both impact and compression protection.Where necessary, safety shoes can be obtained which provide puncture protection.In some work situations, metatarsal protection should be provided, andin other special situations electrical conductive or insulating safetyshoes would be appropriate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Safety shoes or boots with impact protection would be required forcarrying or handling of materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavytools, which could be dropped, and for other activities where objects mightfall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection wouldbe required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual materialhandling carts) around bulk rolls (such as paper rolls) and around heavypipes, all of which could potentially roll over an employee's feet. Safetyshoes or boots with puncture protection would be required where sharp objectssuch as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., couldbe stepped on by employees causing an injury. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some occupations (not a complete list) for which foot protection shouldbe considered are: shipping and receiving clerks, stock clerks, carpenters,electricians, machinists, mechanics and repairers, plumbers and pipe fitters,structural metal workers, assemblers, drywall installers and lathers, packers,wrappers, craters, punch and stamping press operators, sawyers, welders,laborers, freight handlers, gardeners and groundskeepers, timber cuttingand logging workers, stock handlers and warehouse laborers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. <T3>Selection guidelines for head protection. </T3>All head protection(hardhats) is designed to provide protection from impact and penetrationhazards caused by falling objects. Head protection is also available whichprovides protection from electric shock and burn. When selecting head protection,knowledge of potential electrical hazards is important. Class A helmets,in addition to impact and penetration resistance, provide electrical protectionfrom low-voltage conductors (they are proof tested to 2,200 volts). ClassB helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance, provide electricalprotection from high-voltage conductors (they are proof tested to 20,000volts). Class C helmets provide only impact and penetration resistance(they are usually made of aluminum which conducts electricity), and shouldnot be used around electrical hazards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Where falling object hazards are present, head protection must beworn. Some examples include: working below other workers who are usingtools and materials which could fall; working around or under conveyorbelts which are carrying parts or materials; working below machinery orprocesses which might cause material or objects to fall; and working onexposed energized conductors. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some occupations (not a complete list) for which head protection shouldbe considered are: carpenters, electricians, linemen, mechanics and repairers,plumbers and pipefitters, assemblers, packers, wrappers, sawyers, welders,laborers, freight handlers, timber cutting and logging, stock handlers,and warehouse laborers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-18947 Filed 8-15-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
