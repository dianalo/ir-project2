The 50-year-old entrepreneur, who came to symbolize a tumultuousdecade of airline deregulation, is selling most of his stake inContinental Airlines Holdings Inc. to Scandinavian Airlines System.The leading foreign carrier has held a small stake in Houston-basedContinental for two years.   Lorenzo also is resigning as chairman and chief executive, to bereplaced by Delta Air Lines Inc. President Hollis L. Harris.Harris, a highly respected manager, was lured to Continental aftera discreet search that started four months ago.   Lorenzo will receive nearly $30 million in severance, retain asmall interest in Continental's stock options and keep a seat onthe company's board of directors.   But Lorenzo's influence in running the company virtually willdisappear and his compensation reflects a fraction of the value theairline operation used to have in better times.   Houston-based Continental Holdings, formerly known as Texas AirCorp., once commanded 20 percent of the domestic airline marketthrough its ownership of Continental and Eastern airlines.   But its business has been severely crimped by heavy debts and adebilitating strike at Eastern that's now 17 months old. Last yearthe parent company lost $885.6 million, an industry record.   ``It's been perfectly obvious to me that I personally havebecome a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company hastaken in the process of making the changes that have beenrequired,'' Lorenzo said.   ``This transaction allows me to step aside and allows thecompany to have a new management,'' he said. Asked what he would donow, Lorenzo said, ``Take a little time to catch my breath. Ihaven't had much time to do that.''   He spoke to reporters at a New York news briefing, flanked byHollis and SAS Chairman Jan Carlzon. All three called thearrangement a strategic move that would strengthen Continental intoa global airline for the 1990s.   SAS, which is spending a total of $50 million in the deal, willroughly double its stake to 18.4 percent of the company's votingstock. Carlzon said SAS had no interest in gaining control of theairline. Federal law already limits foreign ownership is limited to25 percent.   ``We think Continental has an interesting future,'' Carlzonsaid. ``It's better to have 18.4 percent than 9.9 percent.''   Wall Street reacted positively to the announcement, reflectinginvestor optimism that the change would help Continental's businessimprove.   Its stock, which traded as high as $23.75 a share over the pastyear but recently traded in the $4-5 range, rose $1.75 on theAmerican Stock Exchange in active trading to $6.75.   Lorenzo's exit from the airline world marks the end of an erathat in many ways was shaped by him. From his initial plunge intothe flying business in the 1960s as an analyst for Trans WorldAirlines and later as an executive of a small Texas airlinecompany, Lorenzo helped pioneer innovations ranging from cut-ratefares to the industry's first hostile takeover.   But Lorenzo aroused labor hatred because of what unions calledhis brutal tactics to cut employee costs, one of the biggestexpenses in the industry besides fuel.   Lorenzo called his strategies necessary to stay profitable inderegulated skies that allowed airlines to set their own fares andfly wherever they wished _ enormous changes in an industry unusedto competition.   His war with labor began after he won Continental Airlines in atakeover bid in 1981. Two years later he plunged the airline intobankruptcy court, scrapped union contracts and hired low-costreplacements for striking workers.   Lorenzo's reputation among unionists worsened after he boughtunprofitable Eastern Airlines in 1986. Three years later angryunions struck, accusing Lorenzo of gutting the airline.   He responded by placing Eastern in bankruptcy court, but itsenormous debts and enduring strike crippled the carrier and madecreditors increasingly edgy. Last April an irritated federalbankruptcy judge gave control of Eastern to a trustee, which manystrikers regarded as vindication.   Unionists reacted to Lorenzo's announcement Thursday with a mixof satisfaction and resentment. The International Association ofMachinists, which has led the Eastern strike from the start, saidhe was largely responsible for the problems in his company.   ``Frank Lorenzo demolished Eastern Airlines, wreaked havoc onthousands of workers' lives and severely devalued ContinentalAirlines,'' said John Peterpaul, IAM general vice president.``Those facts dampen our elation at seeing Lorenzo finally leavingthe industry. He is the epitome of what is wrong with corporateAmerica today.   ``Our condolences to whatever industry he stalks next.''</TEXT></DOC>
