<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-32-0210 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new theory of knowledge representation is proposed, called CognitiveRepresentation Theory (CRT). CRT encompasses representational ideas thathave emerged from work in semantic networks, frames, frame semantics,and Conceptual Dependency. The theory attempts to meet certain desideratafor a meaning representation, namely, the principles of adequacy, interpretability,uniformity, economy, and, in particular, cognitive correspondence. Itis based upon a notion called the absolute/aspectual distinction. Inaddition, the theory incorporates as representational entities notionsreminiscent of natural language metaphoric and metonymic relationships.This is done through a mechanism called views. The theory allows forthe representation of some ideas that in the past have only been representedprocedurally, informally, or not at all. An implementation of much ofCRT, called KODIAK, has been created, and used in a number of experimentalAI systems.</TEXT></DOC>
