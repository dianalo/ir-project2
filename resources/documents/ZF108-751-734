 That program entered approximately 3,000 computers andinterrupted service on them, but did no damage (see Communications, June1989).andP;  In March 1990 the judge sentenced Morris to a three-year suspendedjail term, a fine of $10,000, and 400 hours of community service.andP;  Morrisalso had to pay all attorney fees associated with the case, estimated to beat least $150,000.andM;This affair has commanded continual attention among computer people.andP;  In themonths following the worm's attack, several organizations or theirrepresentatives issued strong statements deploring the incident and callingfor new standards of responsible behavior among computer users.andP;  Many of uswatched every step as the case inched its way through the court system, andthe sentencing has not stilled the discussion.andM;From my own samplings of opinion, I have the impression that most computerpeople feel Morris's sentence was appropriate, given that the worm actuallydid no damage to any of the systems it invaded and given that Morris had nointention of causing any harm od disruption.andP;  A sizable minority say thepenalty was not severe enough: a jail term should have been included.andP;  Someof those who felt the penalty too lenient are advocating new policy positionsthat would affect future computer abusers.andP;  I would like to comment on this.andM;One policy proposal is that the professional societies take a stand thatemployers should refuse to hire anyone, such as Morris, who has beenconvicted of a computer crime.andP;  A recent illustration comes from GeneSpafford, who figured prominently in unraveling the mystery of the worm.andP;  Heis quoted as saying that consumer pressure can help the computing communityrid itself of hackers: members can refuse to do business with any firm thatwould employ a known hacker (News Track, Communications, May 1990).andP;  He saysthat such an action would signal others that good computer security jobs canbe had simply by breaking into computers.andP;  Hiring Morris, said Spafford,would be like &quot;hiring a known arsonist to install a fire alarm.andP;  Just becausehe knows how to set a fire doesn't mean he knows how to extinguish one.&quot;andP;  Idisagree with Gene on this one: hackers do not constitute an identifiable orcohesive community and employers ought to be free to take risks on whom theyhire; moreover, it makes a false analogy between someone who intends to causedamage and Morris, who did not.andP;  Spafford is not a lone advocate of thisposition.andP;  Others have asked the ACM officers to endorse it, and thus far, totheir credit, the ACM officers have declined.andM;I have asked several advocates of a stiffer penalty or of ACM action whatunderlies their exhortations.andP;  &quot;Sending a signal,&quot; is the usual response.andO;&quot;We need to make clear to others who might perform similar acts that thecommunity will not tolerate such acts any longer.andP;  Severe penalties endorsedby the community will discourage them.andP;  A jail term for Morris would havedone the job.&quot;andM;I am intrigued by this reasoning.andP;  It shows up frequently in news reportsabout court actions in many domains.andP;  One editorialist says, &quot;This is a happyday.andP;  The court's action will send a signal to others who might considersimilar crimes.andP;  We can look for fewer of these crimes in the future.&quot;andO;Regarding the same verdict or sentence, another editorialist says, &quot;This is asad day.andP;  The court has sent the wrong signal to those who might considersimilar acts.andP;  We can look for more of these crimes in the future.&quot;andP;  Thisreasoning is not limited to the public-policy consequences of private courtcases.andP;  It shows up daily at the federal level--for example, Congress isurged to pass economic sanctions against some nation in order to &quot;send asignal&quot; to the leaders of that country that &quot;the American people will nolonger tolerate their behavior.&quot;andP;  The calls for sending signals persist andbecome louder each year.andP;  What started as a metaphor is becoming an acceptedtruth: our job is only to decide what signals to send, rather than toquestion whether the idea of sending a signal means anything, whether anyonecan tell whether the signals were received, or whether innocent bystanderswere injured by the sanctions.andM;Against this background, the argument about choosing penalties to &quot;sendsignals&quot; is especially beguiling.andP;  It can easily entice us to forget afundamental principle of jurisprudence: the punishment should fit the crime.andO;The signal-senders ask the judge (and the rest of us) to substitute anothersentence, directed not at the person convicted but at someone else.andP;  In myopinion, this line of argument is an affront to American traditions.andM;Morris must learn to live his life with a federal conviction on his record.andO;When he has fulfilled all the terms of his sentence, he will have completedmore community service than most of us.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
