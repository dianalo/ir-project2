As forcontrol system on energy-saving operations of compressors, there arethree kinds of systems: number control, pressure control, and high efficiencycontrol. In the number control, the unloaded compressors are detectedand stopped to exclude idling losses. In the pressure control, dischargepressure of the compressors are regulated to be minimum required levelso as to decline power consumption. In the high-efficiency control, theefficient compressors are selected and operated giving priority. Theenergy-saving operations described above are carried out through predictivecalculations of pressure fluctuations and calculations of loading capacitiesby discharge pressure. GROUPROL is made up of small, medium, and largecapacity series. The large capacity type is composed of one or two controlunits for small-capacity compressor system and a high-speed microcomputerfor effecient control. The total derivery of the three series from 1970to 1986 was 448 sets, their energy-saving effect amounts to three billionyen. In addition, there are much more effects such as a reduction indowntime through stable automatic operation, and a cutback in maintenancecost. (7 figs, 2 tabs, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
