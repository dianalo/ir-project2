Not really. It doesn't have anything to do with it,'' hesaid. Some of the 84 poems in the book concern the suicide of hisgirlfriend, Laurie Bird, in 1979.   ``It seems that the artists' agenda is to be true to feelingsand emotions, fearlessly, so that we can all recognize ourselves,''he said in an interview. ``Fearlessly is the key word.   ``We give ourselves a catharsis by recognizing the many colorsof human nature, including the darks. My notion of such an artistis one who has the bravery to deal with the complexity of the humanheart and psyche. That's where I'm coming from, to the best of myability.''   From 1983 through 1987, the poetry muse kept biting Garfunkel.``Then the pen dried up. I know what the reason is. In 1987 Istarted making the `Lefty' album. I was moving from the world ofwords to the world of music. I guess I reorganized my creativeimpulses to a new direction.''   Garfunkel's older brother, Jules, urged him to take his poems toeditor Leslie Wells, who thought they should be a book, which hasbeen published by E.P. Dutton.   ``The poems are in four categories, that's how I look at them,''he said. ``One is the spirit of traveling. One is how I work.''Poems 59 through 65 concern ``The Animals' Christmas,'' an album ofsongs by Jimmy Webb, sung by Garfunkel and Amy Grant in 1986.   ``One is philosophical speculations. The fourth category ismemory of Laurie Bird. Catharsis is a notion I find popular. Idon't know if I can connect with that. Had I never written abouther, would I have been more blocked? I would have thought all thesethings. My friends know how deeply I was affected by her, when Iloved her and when I lost her.   ``Time makes things fade,'' Garfunkel said. ``I love Kim now.The memory of Laurie is mercifully fading. It is giving me a break.I have a chance to live life now. When I wrote these, in themid-'80s, is not really where I'm at now.''   On Sept. 18, 1988, Garfunkel and Kathryn ``Kim'' Cermak weremarried in the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. She had sung in the groupLime, worked as a model and currently is developing a solo show.   ``I had a real fear of marriage,'' Garfunkel said. ``I was oneof the real tough cases. When it came to trust in that area, onlythe great Kathryn could have relaxed me on that, with a lot of loveand niceness.   ``I'm sure I'm the millionth person to fear the wonderful. Ifsomething comes along that offers you a major increase in yourlife, you say, `Can I get back to you on this?'   ``The day I said, `I'm going to marry Kathryn,' was the day Iclarified my life. ... I've been so reclusive in the '80s. I'vebeen reclusive long enough.''   That doesn't mean that he'll start writing songs. ``I once hadseven or eight lines of a poem and I liked the way it laid. Ithought, `Let me turn it into a song.' After two hours of laboring,all the inspiration dried up.''   But he may tour more.   In 1988 Garfunkel toured with British musicians in England andJapan. This fall he's singing in Europe. ``I'm trying out a leanermusical line. I'm going to try to work with one guitar and onepiano, often not playing at the same time, on what I call `theless-is-more tour.' If I can be in really good voice, let me clearout the backing so I can be heard in all my nuances.''   In January, he'll do 12 shows in Japan with a full band.   In the past, he has done more recording than live concerts.``The studio has always been the fun for me. You're working againstyour own perfectionism. You can erase it till it's right.   ``But I've cooled out. When we (Simon and Garfunkel) were injunior high school, we wanted a hit. The desire to have a hit calmsdown after you have success.''   Garfunkel likes to travel.   ``I like to ventilate my intensity. I want air, elbow room andthe sweep of nature as an antidote. I like crossing the Atlantic byship after recordiing in a studio.''   He also is walking across the United States, a bit at a time. Heleft his apartment one day, crossed the George Washington Bridge,walked for nine days and came home, picking up later exactly wherehe left off in West Virginia.   ``Kim came along in West Virginia and northern Missouri. Iusually do it myself. I'm now about 25 miles from Lincoln, Neb.,''he said.   ``I take the smallest paved roads I find. In general, humankindness goes up in the smaller areas. In remote areas, more peoplestop and offer a ride.'' Garfunkel always refuses.   He admits that his walk is ``the rich man's way to do it.'' Hegoes with an assistant who rents a car. When it's dark, theassistant picks Garfunkel up and backtracks to the nearest motel.   Garfunkel sent Paul Simon, with whom relations have sometimesbeen strained, a copy of his book. Simon said he liked it.   ``He's a man of integrity,'' Garfunkel said. ``He could haveavoided saying anything.   ``We went to a Yankee game last summer. Kim sat between us. Itwas really nice. There's nothing like time. It does it's own sweet,soothing thing.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Tues Nov. 21</NOTE></DOC>
