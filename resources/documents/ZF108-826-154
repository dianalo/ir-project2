 This works out to the best gain since1987, if in fac these budget request translate into commensurate authorizedspending as fiscal 1991 gets under way Oct. 1.andM;Within the administration there appears to be a tug of war between the budgetsummiteers, who demand hefty cuts in most discretionary expense categories,and the wiser or cooler heads within the agencies, who see informationsystems (IS) spending as at least a partial solution to their overallandM;The latter group's argument is that carefully targeted IS spending (e.g., onlocal area networking) increase productivity and reduces costs.andP;  Theseadvocates of more IS spending to automate the biggest paper factory in theworld, namely the U.S.andP;  government, undoubtedly are on the right track.andM;But will they be listened to?andP;  Certainly not, if in the face of a stalematein the ongoing budget negotiations the Gramm-Rudman mandated sequesterprocedure is invoked.andM;And once the micromanaging congressional oversight committees sense that inorder to stay within budget the agencies may have to employ fewer of the lessskilled, less educated workers--whose jobs can be accomplished bycomputers--all hell likely will break loose.andM;Last ResortandM;Many politicians and social scientists view the government as the employer oflast resort and will resist a concerted drive to instill much-neededefficiency into the workings of the government if that drive penalizes theless fortunate members of our society.andM;If in fiscal 1991 the economy is relatively weak and unemployment is rising,shifting budgetary resources from clerical and semi-professional jobs to theaccelerated application of information technology will be a hard sell.andM;This dilemma is somewhat analogous to that facing the Defense Department.andP;  Inview of its reduced budget, DOD plans to close bases, with concomitant impacton employment, and also will reduce military manning levels in certain partsof the world.andP;  The predictable outcry from the to-be-affected geographicareas seriously impedes significant progress in this direction.andM;The apparently preferred solution is to cut out or reduce spending on weaponssystems--unquestionably there is room for economies there--and at least delayimplementation of otherwise justifiable IS programs.andP;  If actual IS spendingfor fiscal 1991, after the inevitable budget compromise, is allowed toincrease &quot;only&quot; 5 percent, this still represents a respectable gain more orless in line with prior years.andM;The bean counters who track federal IS procurement are jubilant.andP;  Shouldn'tthe vendors focusing on selling information technology to the government besmiling too?andP;  Not really.andP;  They hardly are dancing in the aisles.andM;To be sure, there are plenty of opportunities to bid on federal IS business.andO;But the traditional IS vendors have learned from bitter experience that it isdifficult to make much money on competitive federal procurements.andM;The IS industry as a whole is plagued by excess production capacity.andP;  At thesame time, the aerospace and defense companies, suffering from a dearth ofweapons systems business, are eying IS-based systems integration as anattractive diversification avenue.andM;Of course, they are mistaken, and, worse yet, they generally lack theexperience to handle the more complex IS tasks.andP;  However, they are eager toget in on what they perceive to be a growth market that will allow them tocapitalize to a degree on their expertise in weapons systems integration andtheir understanding of the procurement process.andM;Some of these aerospace companies, in fact, are willing to &quot;buy thebusiness,&quot; viewing the transaction as a learning experience.andP;  One example isGeneral Dynamics Corp.'s win of the Air Force's Strategic War Planning Systemcontract, a story too well-known to require repetition here.andM;Add to this the fact that the major systems vendors such as Hewlett-PackardCo., IBM Corp. and Unisys Corp. and, of course, the leading systemsintegrators and facility managers such as Computer Sciences Corp. andElectronic Data Systems Corp. are moving to strengthen their efforts to gainshare in the federal IS market.andM;Their motivation in doing this is to help amortize corporatewide fixed costsand leverage their increasingly costly Randamp;D programs.andM;The end result of all this is a ferociously competitive marketplace ripe forvicious price cutting to the point, where even the final winner (afterprotracted and expensive protests) has to use clever accounting allocationschemes to show his corporate management that a profit, albeit a small one,is being made.andM;No wonder then so many medium-sized and small information technologycompanies focusing on the federal market have been on the block, among themAdvanced Technology Inc., BDM International Inc., Planning Research Corp. andSystemhouse Inc.andP;  These companies have had great difficulty in finding buyersat or near their asking prices -- anywhere from 50 percent to 100 percent ofcurrent annualized revenues, depending on profitability.andM;Several other companies also are looking for an exit, more discreetly.andP;  Untilthe backlog of publicly for-sale IS companies has been worked down, it isdifficult for the less widely announced companies for sale to evoke seriousinterest among potential buyers.andM;One thing seems certain:  There will be attrition among the medium-sized andsmaller vendors focusing on the federal IS market.andP;  Over the longer term thepolicy-makers in the administration and the Congress will rue the day theyallowed this to happen.andM;Sooner or later the price of Is solutions provided to the government will goup as oligopolistic conditions emerge.andP;  That prospect is pleasing to thelikely survivors--the larger vendors with deep pockets--but of littleconsolation to the smaller companies that will have left the market eitherbecause they have bech bought out or because they folded their tentsalthogether.andM;Ulric Weil is president of Weil andamp; Associates, a Washington consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
