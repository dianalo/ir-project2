The nationwide turnout was 25.31 percent, the lowest in postwarPoland, according to State Electoral Commission spokesman BogdanSzczesniak.   It appeared the turnout would be higher than 25 percent only insix provinces where Solidarity candidates were in the contests.   Initial reports showed Solidarity candidates leading in five ofthe six provinces, according to local Solidarity CitizensCommittees. They had no figures from the sixth province.   Most of the parliamentary seats being contested in the runoffwere reserved for candidates of the Communist Party and its allies.The communists had hoped for a good turnout but most voters stayedhome in areas where there was no opposition challenge.   In the June 4 voting, Solidarity clinched 252 of the 261 seatsalotted the opposition in the National Assembly, comprised of the460-seat Sejm and a newly created 100-seat Senate. Voter turnout was62 percent.   Sunday's runoff became a lackluster contest for the Sejm seatsset aside for the communists.   But Solidarity did have a chance to wrap up the remaining eightseats in the freely contested Senate, where it earlier won 92 of 100places.   Solidarity also sought to build its power in the Sejm, the lowerhouse in the assembly, by endorsing reform-oriented communistcandidates.   Solidarity secured 160 of the 161 Sejm seats open to opppostionin the first round of voting. Only three communist candidates _reformers backed by Solidarity activists _ received the 50 percentof the vote needed to win.   Of the 35 top government officials among the unopposed Sejmcandidates, 33 did not receive 50 percent. They were replaced by 66new candidates in the second round.   Final results were not expected before Monday.      After the enthusiasm for the historic first round, it seemed manyvoters turned back to daily life in economically pressed Polandfeeling they had made their views clear.   The National Election Commission _ comprised of government andopposition members to ensure a trustworthy tally _ reported 8.6percent of the 27 million eligible voters had cast ballots by noon,compared with 22.7 percent by that time on June 4.   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, voting near his Gdansk home, saidhe thought no more than 50 percent of Poles would vote.   The lowest previous turnout was 56 percent in June 1988provincial council voting, but these are the first nationwide runoffelections.   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski said as he voted in Warsawthat putting an end to elections with a pre-determined outcome was arisk for the communist government, but was necessary to implementdemocratic reform negotiated with the opposition.   The Polish elections are the freest in Eastern Europe in fourdecades.   ``So far what is important is that we are talking to eachother,'' Jaruzelski said.   The communists' best chance for a Senate seat was HenrykStoklosa, the wealthy owner of a fertilizer company in western Pilaprovince who waged Poland's most expensive election campaign. He wasthe only coalition candidate to outpoll a Solidarity opponent in thefirst round, although he did not win a majority.   Jerzy Majka, the hard-line editor of the Communist Party'sTrybuna Ludu newspaper said the 60-odd communists with Solidaritybacking were ``immoral,'' in a front-page editorial Saturday.   ``The opposition is working toward making a split in the party,''Majka said. ``It is immoral and tasteless that some of our comradesare courting Solidarity.''   The communist coalition did borrow an election tactic fromSolidarity for this round. The party stationed supporters at somepolls in Warsaw as Solidarity did June 4.   A medical academy student said he was being paid $12 per shift todistribute leaflets for the communist coalition outside one pollingstation.   Poll watchers in Warsaw and Krakow and in Bydgoszcz, Slupsk andRadom, where there were senate races with Solidarity candidates, allreported turnouts ranging up to 35 percent by midafternoon.   Marek Jagielski, an engineer, said he decided it was worthwhileto vote because the Sejm ``has a lot of say about political andsocial matters.   ``The results of parliament's work depends on who gets the seats,so I voted for those candidates suggested by Solidarity,'' he said.   The rallies, speeches and posters that anticipated the June 4voting were largely absent before the second round. Instead,attention focused on the government changes expected to follow.   The Communist Party plans a Central Committee plenum at the endof the month to pick a presidential candidate who will nominate thenext prime minister.</TEXT></DOC>
