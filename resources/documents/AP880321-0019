During the late 1970s and early '80s, EEC exporters supplied arising share of the U.S. wine market, with imports peaking in 1984.Since then, Spain and Portugal have joined the trading bloc,raising EEC membership to 12 countries.   ``Based on grape, wine and transportation cost comparisons,California, France and Italy have similar total costs for producingand transporting wine to major U.S. markets,'' the report said.   Imports of non-premium table wines from the EEC ``should notreach the levels they did in 1984 in the near future,'' it said.``However, because of its wine surplus, which is projected to reach20 million to 25 million hectoliters in 1991-92, the (EEC) willcontinue to place heavy emphasis on exports to the United States.''   A liter is slightly more than a quart, and a hectoliter is 100liters, or roughly 26.5 gallons. The EEC wine surplus, therefore,could exceed 660 million gallons in four years.   The report was prepared by two Cornell University agriculturaleconomists, Gerald B. White and David Blandford, for thedepartment's Economic Research Service.   According to studies, the transportation costs of shipping wineto the eastern United States are about $3 per case from Italy andFrance, and $2 from California. Actual production costs wereestimated at $9.98 per nine-liter case in California; $9.37 inFrance; and $8.10 in Italy.   One reason for the large EEC wine surplus has been a shift inEuropean drinking habits, according to consumer studies in France.   ``A switch from high-energy-using manual labor tolower-energy-using work reduced caloric needs of which wine was animportant source,'' the report said. ``In addition, wine had an`old product' image that was less in tune with younger people thanother beverages such as mineral water, beer and soft drinks.''   The French studies probably also explain declining wineconsumption in Italy and Spain, ``where an exodus of populationfrom the rural economy continues and old traditions are beingreplaced,'' the report said.   On the other hand, there has been a trend toward the consumptionof higher quality wines produced in specific regions, the reportadded. Accordingly, EEC policy for the last 15 years has emphasizedthe production of the quality wines.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department is tuning up itshoney support program for 1988, and there's still a few days leftto submit public comments on what to do.   Congress authorized in the Food Security Act of 1985 a``marketing loan'' program for honey to help reduce inventoriesheld as surplus by the department's Commodity Credit Corp.   Under the marketing loan concept, a farmer can get a regular CCCloan at a specified price support level and then, if he chooses,can repay the loan at the prevailing market rate.   The law set the honey support at 64 cents per pound for 1986 and63 cents in 1987. It says the loan for 1988 through 1990 will bethe rate for the previous year, reduced by 5 percent. However, the1988-90 support cannot be lower than 75 percent of the averageprice received by honey producers in the preceding five years,dropping the years of highest and lowest prices.   Currently, the loan repayment rate for 1987-crop honey rangesbetween 34 cents and 40 cents, depending on the color and class.   According to the most recently published figures, inventories ofCCC-owned honey as of Oct. 31, 1987, totaled about 71.2 millionpounds, down from 102.1 million pounds a year earlier.   Written comments on the 1988 honey program, including whether tocontinue the marketing loan program, can be sent by March 25 to:Director, Commodity Analysis Division, USDA-ASCS, Room 3741-S, P.O.Box 2415, Washington, D.C. 20013.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A war against the cotton boll weevil is beingexpanded in Arizona after successful tests in other parts of theSouthwest, says the Agriculture Department.   James Glosser, acting administrator of the department's Animaland Plant Health Inspection Service, said an initial $6 millionprogram in California, western Arizona and northern Mexico reducedthe weevil population by 95 percent in one year and eliminated itin three years.   Now, the campaign is being extended into central and easternArizona, which will alleviate the problem of reinfestation frommigrating weevils, he said. The expanded program will cost about$20 million, with cotton producers paying 70 percent of the bill.   ``Expanding the program will not only protect Arizonaagriculture but will safeguard the progress made in California andMexico as well,'' Glosser said.   By using traps baited with the weevil's natural sex attractant,or pheromone, the insect's populations can be pinpointed, accordingto program director Frank Myers of the Arizona Cotton GrowersResearch and Protection Council.   After that, the insecticide malathion will be applied to fieldsby airplanes or with ground equipment.   Similar programs are also working in the Southeast, where theboll weevil plagued cotton farmers for almost a century, costingthem an estimated $12 billion since its entry from Mexico in 1892,according to USDA officials.</TEXT></DOC>
