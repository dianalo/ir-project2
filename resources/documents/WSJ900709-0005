Hutton andamp; Co.stock during 1986 takeover talks.   Shearson, without admitting or denying the allegations,consented to the exchange's findings that it violated BigBoard rules in its purchases and sales of Hutton stockbetween August and October 1986, while Shearson was making anunsuccessful effort to acquire Hutton. About a year afterthat aborted effort to acquire Hutton, Shearson succeeded inbuying the firm for nearly $1 billion.</LP><TEXT>   A separate Securities and Exchange Commissioninvestigation of the matter has been dropped, people familiarwith the case said. The SEC declined to comment.   The Big Board's investigation involved Shearson's purchaseof Hutton stock before the two firms began exploratory talkson a merger in late September and October 1986. By Sept. 19,according to the Big Board, Shearson had bought about 1.5million shares, or 4.9%, of Hutton's common, just under the5% level that requires public disclosure.   Shearson sold about a third of its Hutton holdings Oct.15; the next day, Hutton announced the talks were off, andits stock price plunged.   The Big Board found that Shearson had engaged in &quot;conductinconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade&quot; inconnection with the Hutton stock sale. Separately, the BigBoard said Shearson had broken rules in its acquisition ofthe Hutton stake by failing to mark certain Hutton purchasesas trades for the firm's own account, rather than forcustomers.   Besides the record fine, the Big Board ordered Shearson toappoint a lawyer who for at least three years will advise iton rules involving securities transactions for its ownaccount.   Shearson, in a statement, said: &quot;We did not violate anylaw or existing interpretation of the exchange rules. Wedetermined to settle rather than going through a protractedprocess over actions that took place years ago.&quot;   As for the alleged violations involving the marking oftrades for its own account, Shearson said: &quot;We took stepsbefore there was any indication of a disciplinary proceedingto help prevent similar processing errors from occurringagain.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
