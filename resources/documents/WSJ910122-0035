But the U.S. air attacks on Iraq, launched from a NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization air base in Turkey, have broughtcriticism of President Ozal from newspapers, bureaucrats andopposition politicians, many of whom assert that his pro-U.S.stand may provoke a counterattack from Saddam Hussein. And inneighboring Greece, a fellow NATO member but traditionalantagonist of Turkey, anxiety has been aroused by Turkey'sattempt to gain special favor with the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   As of yesterday, U.S. aircraft had made about 300 sortiesinto Iraq since Friday from the sprawling Incirlik base nearthe southern Turkish city of Adana, the Associated Pressreported. (The bulk of allied air strikes against Iraq arestill coming from bases in Saudi Arabia and from aircraftcarriers.) The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Monday that Turkeyis considering letting the U.S. planes also use bases inDiyarbakir and Malatya, closer to Iraq than Incirlik, forraids.   The number of U.S. warplanes based in Turkey has nowdoubled to 96. In addition, two batteries of U.S. Patriotmissiles have been positioned to defend Incirlik from Iraqimissile attacks.   Turkish leaders from Mr. Ozal on down continue to insistthat Turkey itself still has no intention of going to waragainst Iraq unless it is first attacked, and that it has nodesigns on Mosul and Kirkuk, oil-rich Ottoman provinces thatmost Turks believe were unfairly ceded to British-mandatedIraq in 1926.   Even before the news of the use of Incirlik, Turkey showedWashington it is a solid ally by closing an Iraqi oilpipeline that traverses Turkey. And last week's vote byTurkey's Parliament permitting U.S. fighter aircraft tolaunch such strikes from inside Turkey added a new offensivepunch against Saddam Hussein.   However there are fears of a backlash in Turkey, NATO'sonly Muslim member, whose participation in the conflict isdeeply divisive for the Parliament and opposed by Islamicfundamentalists. On Monday night in Istanbul, gunmenoverpowered guards at a NATO maintenance facility, and thenset bombs that caused extensive damage but no injuries. Acommunist anti-government group claimed responsibility.   To curtail domestic opposition, Turkey has censoredinformation about U.S. military activities against Iraq.Journalists aren't allowed to travel east from the bordercity of Cizra. And state-run Turkish television, whichtransmits Cable News Network reports on the war, cuts themoff when news from Turkey is shown, the AP reported. TurkishTelevision and the semiofficial Anatolia news agency are alsoforbidden to report on activities at Incirlik, thoughnewspapers have reported the censored CNN reports.   &quot;Turkey is an island of stability in a rough sea,&quot; Mr.Ozal told Turkish television recently. &quot;Turkey is a powerthat can bring stability to the region. We must play thisrole. {Regional} countries want us to play this role.&quot;   One regional country that doesn't is Greece. Greece is apartner in the allied coalition against Iraq. But the Greeksexpress concern that Turkey, by allowing use of its territoryfor attacks on Iraq, will be able to cash in on the West'sgratitude for its role -- at Greek expense.   &quot;We're going to have a regional great power playing therole of policeman around here,&quot; laments one Greek foreignaffairs analyst, echoing widespread press commentary.   Greece and Turkey have been at odds for a long time andmost recently over what Greece sees as an act of aggressionthat went unpunished -- the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus.Disputes over Aegean Sea sovereignty and ethnic minoritieshave compounded the tensions.   In a televised weekend address, Greek Prime MinisterConstantine Mitsotakis came close to admitting that fear ofTurkey determines Greece's policy on the Gulf war. &quot;At a timewhen Turkey is offering support and bases . . . it would beirresponsible, silly and dangerous for Greece to be a mereobserver,&quot; he said.   Greece's contribution to the allied military effort is inthe form of a frigate doing escort duty for U.S. aircraftcarriers in the Red Sea. Officials say privately that thereis talk about sending a more substantial Greek contributionto the Gulf in the form of fighter squadrons.   Greek suspicion surfaced just before hostilities began,when President Bush said he would grant an additional $82million in military aid to Turkey above the normal amount for1991. Greek officials said the gesture violated thepresident's pledge to Congress that his administration giveseven units of aid to Greece for every 10 given to Turkey.Although Mr. Bush telephoned Mr. Mitsotakis to ask for his&quot;understanding,&quot; the Greeks remain wary.   On the day the first bombs fell on Baghdad, the Greekpress accused the Turks of harboring expansionist desires. &quot;AFresh Recital Of Expansionism and Greed,&quot; blared thepro-government Eleftheros Typos, the country'sbiggest-selling tabloid, in commenting on Turkish PresidentOzal's call for postwar talks to determine the region'sfuture.   Turkish diplomats in Athens reject the Greek scenarios.&quot;We have troubles enough on our eastern border withoutworrying about the Aegean,&quot; said one.</TEXT></DOC>
