A spokesman for Chevron said the San Francisco-based company already has spent $36 million on cleanup work at the site during the past three years. He said Chevron will spend an additional $50 million over the next 20 years, most of it sooner rather than later, to clean up the two million to six million barrels that leaked underground.    Chevron was ordered to act by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board, which approved Chevron's clean-up plan Monday.    &quot;In terms of volume of pollutants, this is probably the largest project in California,&quot; said Ray Delacourt, the board engineer overseeing the Chevron matter. But he said Chevron has been cooperative, and that favorable geology has kept the spill away from drinking water. </TEXT></DOC>
