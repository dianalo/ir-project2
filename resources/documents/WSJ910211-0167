Allied troops are focusing this weekend on how to handlethe two major remaining Iraqi threats. First, SaddamHussein's forces in Kuwait possess more than a thousandpieces of dug-in artillery that can kill with both shrapneland shells that are laden with poison gas. Second, the Iraqishave sprinkled the desert in front of their lines withhundreds of thousands of deadly mines.</LP><TEXT>   It may well be that major ground action isn't nearly soimminent as it feels here at the front; there were strongindications in Washington over the weekend that the bigoffensive could be preceded by weeks of feints andskirmishes.   But whenever it comes, the allied attack will be of a sizeand complexity unlike anything seen in almost half a century.To minimize the casualties from the shelling, gas and mines,allied commanders here say their battle plans will emphasizespeed, maneuvering ability and far-reaching weaponry.   &quot;We are prepared for some very large, lethal and I thinkvery quick battles,&quot; says Col. Leroy R. Goff, a brigadecommander in the Third Armored Division, the most heavilyarmored unit in the U.S. arsenal. He and other commandershere have rehearsed attacks that would use the tanks andtroops of almost an entire armored corps -- at least 40,000soldiers -- in one swift coordinated move. The U.S. hasn'tmounted an attack of that size in decades.   &quot;It's rather like organizing a large number of high-speedtrains moving in parallel and then crossing each others'paths or tracks in the dark,&quot; commented one British commanderafter a recent giant nighttime exercise.   Air power will be key in shaping the ground battle, thatcommander said. The absence of Iraqi aircraft will allow theallies to concentrate their forces to a degree that wouldnever have been risked on a European battlefield. And beforeU.S. tank columns move forward, an avalanche of U.S. airstrikes will attempt to bury the Iraqi rear in what Armyplanners call &quot;deep battle,&quot; which essentially means hittingthe enemy before he can get close enough to hit you.   But the toughest threat will be the web of artillery andmines at the Iraqi front. Artillery is the biggest killer inconventional wars, often causing as many as half of allcasualties. And Iraqi minefields in western Kuwait and alongthe Iraqi-Saudi border have been designed to maximize thedestructive power of the big guns by blocking armored columnsand channeling them into &quot;killing zones&quot; where shells canrain down on them.   Perhaps the bravest moments in the early stages of thebattle will come when Army engineers attempt to clearpathways through the minefields so their tanks can keepmoving. Iraq's most dangerous mine is its tire-sizedanti-tank device, which can lift an M1A1 tank six feet intothe air. Interspersed with those are &quot;toe poppers,&quot;hard-to-see mines that can blow off a soldier's leg, and&quot;bouncing Betties&quot; that spring up to waist level and unleasha load of shrapnel that can cut a man in half.   Engineers must enter this hellish place with mine rakesand line-charge explosives because they can't be sure thatair power and artillery alone can clear a sufficient pathway.Some of Iraq's mines, purchased from Italy, contain baffles,devices that can withstand the temporary pressure of a bombor shell explosion and are only triggered by the more lastingimprint of a tank rolling above. So, as a last resort, combatengineers will blow up remaining anti-tank mines withhand-set explosive charges called &quot;drop and pops.&quot;   &quot;We have to keep moving forward&quot; if the Army's battle planis to succeed, says Lt. Col. Dana Robertson, head of theThird Armored Division's engineers.   All these efforts will be complicated by Iraq's hugestores of chemical weapons, including cyanide, mustard andnerve gas -- some in concoctions that have never beenconfronted before by western forces. Iraq's major deliveryvehicle for gas will be its artillery and French -- andBrazilian -- made rocket launchers.   During the final stages of the Iran-Iraq war, Iraqigenerals used the poison gas like minefields to set up enemytroops for artillery. They pinned down or channeled largeconcentrations of Iranian troops by hitting them from thefront with cyanide and nerve gas, while preventing retreat bylaying down a belt of skin-blistering mustard gas in therear, according to a recent book by a Pakistani author, DilipHiro.   The first allied response to a chemical barrage, said Lt.Col. John Sharples, commander of Britain's Royal ScotsDragoon Guards, will be to move right through it. &quot;We can andwill fight dirty&quot; -- that is, contaminated, he said. &quot;We canmove, engage the enemy and replenish our fuel if the enemydecides to use blister or nerve agents against us.&quot; Duringtheir recent exercise, he said, British troops remained intheir protective charcoal-impregnated suits for as long as 36hours.   The second response will be to use allied artillery andair power to knock out Iraq's remaining guns. Two new U.S.computerized radars, the Q-36 and Q-37, can pinpoint thelocation of an enemy artillery battery by taking two readingsof the ballistic path of an incoming enemy shell.   Once those positions are located, U.S. troops can zero inon them with artillery and rocket launchers, made much moreaccurate in this war by the use of laser range-finders andsatellite-run positioning sytems. Alternatively, Air ForceA-10 and F-16 bombers can deliver a &quot;fuel-air&quot; bomb, a weaponwhose shock and killing power is said by some to approachthat of a small nuclear weapon. The bomb creates a largecloud of volatile gas and then ignites it, sucking the oxygenout of the air and slamming the ground with a ferocious shockwave.   A third response to chemical weapons, designed to protectthe fleets of supply trucks, fuel trucks and reserve forcescoming in behind the armored columns, will be astrange-looking, six-wheeled vehicle that seeks outcontaminated areas and marks their limits with triangularyellow signs. These are the &quot;Fox Reconnaissance Systems,&quot;rolling chemical laboratories from which technicians canreach out with protective gloves or a robot device to collectsamples of the poisons. Inside, they can analyze the samplesinstantly with a mass spectrometer that has the chemicalformulas for up to 420 known poisons stored in its memorybank. The U.S. Army borrowed sixty Foxes from the GermanArmy. Signals from the vehicles will help units avoidcontaminated areas and help prepare medical units in therear.   The job of treating those wounded who are contaminatedwith modern gas weapons will be unprecedentedly dangerous.Casualities of the battle being contemplated here would beferried by planes and helicopters to a desert facility calledMedBase America, a vast collection of tents near a runwaywhere a special &quot;dirty zone&quot; has been created.   After their clothes are cut away by medics in protectivesuits, but before they are treated, the wounded must besponged with a mild solution of hydrochloric acid. Then comestriage, where the wounded are separated into threecategories: Those expected to die, those who can be saved iftreated immediately, and those whose treatment can bedelayed.   Among those overseeing the triage will be Lt. Col. GlennTripp, an Army surgeon. He will use a grease pencil to writethe letter E on the foreheads of soldiers that he decides aremortally wounded. &quot;E&quot; stands for &quot;expectant.&quot; Patients socategorized will be shifted to an area where they can be keptfree of pain until they die, or until clogged surgeryfacilities have dealt with the other two categories ofwounded.   Classifying an incoming soldier as an &quot;E,&quot; Col. Trippexplained to a visiting pool of reporters, will be hard, butthe stream of casualties possible from a battle of this sizemay make such a judgment inevitable.   &quot;I have dreams about that particular situation because Iknow it will develop,&quot; the surgeon said.</TEXT></DOC>
