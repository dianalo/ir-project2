The Santa Clara, Calif., company, which makesmicrocomputer parts and systems, said it is starting &quot;anaggressive world-wide program&quot; to find alternativemanufacturing techniques that don't rely on CFCs. Intel'smeasures are in response to a federal goal to eliminateindustry's use of CFCs by the year 2000. The move is in linewith a tentative industrywide effort by chip makers to ridthe ozone-depleting emissions from their plants.</LP><TEXT>   Intel began this process three years ago, when it startedtracking CFC levels at its plants. Since then, Intel says ithas lowered its CFC use by about 30%, by experimenting withnew conservation and control methods.   A company spokesman said the new equipment that Intelplans to install to replace CFCs will cost several hundredthousand dollars and &quot;in the long run, it will probably becheaper.&quot; The entire program won't run more than severalmillion dollars, the spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
