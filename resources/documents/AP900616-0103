Divers were planning a rescue mission to pluck about fiveloggerhead turtles from waters near the slick's leading edge, saidEdward Klima of the National Oceanographic and AtmosphericAdministration.   Loggerhead turtles are a threatened species that can grow up to4 feet long and weigh up to 200 pounds, he said.   He said if the turtles eat floating tar balls, mistaking themfor food, they could die. No other marine life appeared to bethreatened, he said.   About 4.6 million gallons of oil have spilled from the Norwegiantanker since it was rocked by an explosion June 8, Coast Guard Lt.Cmdr. Frank Whipple said Saturday. The figure makes the Mega Borgspill the fifth-worst in U.S. history.   Coast Guard officials believe most of that oil _ all but 12,000to 40,000 gallons _ evaporated or burned in the inferno followingthe explosion.   The remaining slick is ``almost hanging out there,'' Whipplesaid. The 45-mile-long slick of Angolan crude oil was about 20miles from Galveston.   Coastal authorities braced for an onslaught of oil that couldreach Texas beaches as early as Sunday, but might not reach shorefor several days, said Sharon Christopherson of NOAA.   Where the oil slick might wash ashore was uncertain, but thelatest estimate identified an area between the west end ofGalveston Island and High Island as the most likely landfall.   About 1,200 volunteers were being trained on how to clean up anyoil reaching shore.   Tony Redding, spokesman for Smit America Salvage Inc., said thefire aboard the 886-foot tanker was declared extinguished Saturdaymorning.   Crews continued to douse the hull of the ship throughout the dayto cool the buckled Mega Borg so workers could begin removing itscargo.   A small, undetermined amount of oil leaked from the shipSaturday, Whipple said.   Geert Koffeman, project manager for Smit America, said thepossibility of the vessel sinking was ``next to nil.''   Skimmers and booms were used on concentrated oil spots, but mostof the slick was too thin to skim.   Texas General Land Office representatives, meanwhile, said theywere pleased with an experiment started Friday when oil-eatingbacteria were dumped on a square acre of the slick.   ``Visually, the results of the microbes are very promising, butwe have no hard science. I'm very optimistic,'' said Blanton Mooreof the Land Office.   He said it was difficult to tell from the air if the oil hadbeen eaten by the bacteria or dissipated some other way, addingthat more microbes will likely be used later.</TEXT></DOC>
