Brig. Gen. Turki bin Nasser, commander of a large RoyalSaudi Air Force base (which cannot be named under presscensorship rules here) calls it a game of electronic &quot;cat andmouse that goes on almost every day.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We see them. We lock on them and they turn around andgo,&quot; he told a group of reporters. &quot;Locking on,&quot; in pilots'jargon, is the first step in preparing radar-guided missilesto fire at an enemy plane.   Gen. Nasser's remarks came during a tour of this base,where reporters saw chemical-weapons detectors positioned indoorways and U.S.-built F-15 fighters in massive, bunker-likehangars built to withstand bombings and chemical-weaponsattacks.   As an unprecedented armada of U.S. forces continues toarrive here, tension in the Saudi government is palpable. ASaudi civilian official said the government has begun buyinggas masks and other gear to protect people who live in theEastern Province near major oil fields from achemical-weapons attack. &quot;We are basically preparing for theworst possibilities,&quot; he said.   Gen. Nasser said that one result of the Persian Gulfcrisis will be a permanent enlargement of the Saudi military.While some officials are talking about a draft, Gen. Nassersaid he felt the enlargement could be carried out withvolunteers. &quot;We don't really need to go to a draft. If wecall, they will come.&quot;   King Fahd, the ruler of this desert kingdom, already hascalled for the opening of recruitment centers for volunteerswho want to join the Saudi armed forces.   Unofficial estimates of the cost of the crisis to theSaudi government range as high as $9 billion to $11 billion,counting extra costs of weaponry, logistics support, housingfor some 100,000 Kuwaiti refugees being put up in hotels atgovernment expense, and the projected effect on the Saudieconomy over the next three months.   Prince Abdullah A. al-Assaf, a pipe-smoking engineer whoheads the government-owned Saudi Petrochemical Co., said hehad no precise estimates. &quot;Nobody sat down to figure out howmuch this is costing,&quot; he said, explaining that the kingdomis prepared to do what needs to be done to protect its peopleand the large expatriate community here.   &quot;This has hurt the whole world. Our economy has been hurttremendously also,&quot; he said. The prince, who oversees thedevelopment of Yanbu and Jubail, two new industrial portcities, worries that foreign businessmen who had agreed toundertake joint ventures there with the Saudis may pull outif the country seems unsafe.   Recently, the prince said, he had scheduled 12 meetings todiscuss joint ventures and 10 of them were canceled.   He and other Saudi officials say Iraq's President SaddamHussein is forcing the kingdom to refocus its spending ondefense. Saddam Hussein, they assert, spent as much as $120billion over the last 10 years on his military, while theSaudi government has spent much of its oil wealth on socialprograms and non-military development.   Another &quot;cost&quot; to the Saudi government has been aninvasion of the kingdom by a multinational force of more than200 reporters, photographers and television crewmen. Themedia circus is new to the privacy-loving Saudis, who haverefused to allow foreign news organizations to have apermanent base here.   Late yesterday, Saudi officials said they were consideringrevoking many of the visas they have issued to reportersduring the crisis and were discussing the resumption of amuch smaller pool of news organizations that would operateunder tight rules imposed by the Pentagon.</TEXT></DOC>
