Their reports are among a flurry of articles in twoleading medical journals that suggest a sex bias in U.S.research and medical care in general may be compromising thehealth of women.</LP><TEXT>   The two heart disease studies show that men are nearlytwice as likely as women to receive such major procedures ascoronary angiography, a crucial diagnostic test, and coronarybypass surgery. Neither report asserts that women receiveinferior care, but some of the findings strongly raise thepossibility.   &quot;Whether it's because women aren't seeking the care, orproviders aren't delivering it, we can't sort that one out,&quot;says Richard M. Steingart, cardiologist atWinthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, N.Y., and principalauthor of one of the studies. &quot;But the system isn't workingas well for women as it is for men.&quot;   The two reports, published in today's New England Journalof Medicine, add to growing concern over disparities thatexist between men and women not only in delivery of care, butalso in clinical research trials that evaluate effectivenessof treatments. Six other articles addressing the subjectappear this week in the New England Journal and the Journalof the American Medical Association, or JAMA, the two mostwidely circulated and influential research publications readby doctors.   In yesterday's JAMA, a report by the AMA's Council onEthical and Judicial Affairs says women have had less accessthan men to certain tests and treatments for kidney diseaseand lung cancer. The report also says research onanti-depressant drugs was initially conducted exclusively onmen, even though depression is reportedly more common amongwomen. Moreover, basing treatment decisions for women on malestudies could be misleading because women respond differentlyto drugs due to effects of their menstrual cycles.   &quot;It is now time for a general awakening,&quot; says BernadineHealy, director of the National Institutes of Health in aneditorial in the New England Journal. &quot;Women have uniquemedical problems,&quot; she says, including many that becomechronic and debilitating late in their lives. Such conditions&quot;aren't the inevitable ravages of age, but are in many caseshighly preventable and eminently treatable.&quot; The NIH recentlylaunched a study called the Women's Health Initiative thatwill examine major causes of death, disability and frailtyamong middle-aged and older women, Dr. Healy says.   Heart disease has long been considered mainly a malady ofmen, partly because it strikes men earlier in life thanwomen, and because males suffer more heart attacks thanfemales. But of the 512,000 annual heart attack deaths in theU.S., 47% are women, making it their No. 1 killer, accordingto the American Heart Association.   Moreover, 39% of women who suffer heart attacks die withina year, compared with 31% of men, the AHA reports. And nearly20% of women, compared with 15% of men, suffer a second heartattack within four years.   Whether such discrepancies relate to levels of treatmentor to living habits and other reasons isn't clear.Researchers say that factors ranging from patient willingnessto undergo major surgery to perceptions about heart diseasein women may affect treatment decisions. Or, the new researchcould reflect overtreatment among men rather thanundertreatment of women, scientists note.   Although previous studies at individual hospitals havedisclosed gender-related disparities in heart treatment, thecurrent reports, based on large groups of hospital patientsnationwide, show the practices are widespread, Dr. Steingartsays.   In one study, John Z. Ayanian and Arnold M. Epstein, ofBrigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, examined records of82,000 patients hospitalized for coronary heart disease inMassachusetts and Maryland in 1987. Men were 28% more likelythan women in Massachusetts and 15% more likely in Marylandto have angiography, an X-ray procedure to determine theextent of blockage of the coronary arteries that feedoxygen-rich blood to the heart.   Odds for undergoing bypass surgery or angioplasty -- aprocedure in which a tiny balloon is inflated in the coronaryarteries to open blockages -- were 45% higher among men thanwomen in Massachusetts and 27% higher in Maryland.   Dr. Steingart and other investigators studied records of1,842 men and 389 women hospitalized with major heart attacksat 112 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada. They found that menwere nearly twice as likely as women to undergo angiographyand bypass surgery. But they also determined that when menand women who had the X-ray procedure were compared,differences in subsequent treatment disappeared.   &quot;Once they get the angiogram, women are just as likely tohave surgery or angioplasty,&quot; says Sandra J. Lewis, chief ofcardiology at Good Samaritan Hospital, Portland, Ore., and aco-author of the report. This finding suggests that a crucialdisparity in access to treatment occurs when women don't getthe diagnostic test.   The researchers also determined that women were moredisabled than men by chest pains and other symptoms of heartdisease before they suffered the attack that put them in thehospital. Despite reduced ability to function, women werestill &quot;less likely to undergo procedures that are known {atleast in men} to lessen symptoms and improve functionalcapacity,&quot; the authors conclude.   A separate report in yesterday's JAMA took a step towardclosing the gender gap. JoAnn E. Manson and other researchersat Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical Schoolfound that aspirin appears to help prevent heart attacks inwomen as well as men.   Their report says women over 50 years old who took fromone to six aspirin a week were 32% less likely to have afirst heart attack than women who took no aspirin. There wasno preventive benefit for women who took seven or moreaspirin a week. However, the study had limitations, and theauthors, therefore, warn that no one should take aspirinregularly without consulting a doctor.   But Dr. Manson says that one tentative finding underscoresthe need to redress the dearth of medical research on heartdisease and women. For women who took more than 15 aspirin aweek, there was a slight increased risk of a brain hemorrhagestroke.   Although the finding wasn't statistically significant,other research shows that women are more likely than men tosuffer strokes. That raises the possibility that usingaspirin studies of men to recommend preventive treatment forwomen could place some women at increased risk for stroke.Future studies are expected to determine a risk-benefit ratiofor aspirin use in both men and women, Dr. Manson says.</TEXT></DOC>
