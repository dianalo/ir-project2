Using the catalogue,we find the FTE occurrence determined from the UKS data set is substantiallyless than that detected using data from the early ISEE 1/2 spacecraftorbits. The UKS data set shows a correlation between FTE occurrence andsouthward external magnetic field, but there are several instances ofpasses in which no FTEs are detected but for which the external fieldwas unambiguously southward. The passes with the largest number of eventsare those for which the field outside the magnetopause has a large Bsub(M)component. We conclude that the lower latitude of the UKS encountersis responsible for the discrepancy with the ISEE occurrence. The mostlikely source region appears to be near the subsolar region.</TEXT></DOC>
