Mr. Beregovoy didn't elaborate, saying that he willoutline the proposals to the policy-making Interim Committeeof the International Monetary Fund when it meets inWashington next week.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Beregovoy singled out the Ivory Coast, the Congo,Gabon and Cameroon as countries that have a higher per-capitagross national product than the poorest sub-Saharancountries, but are nonetheless saddled with a heavy debtburden.   The fact that most of this debt is owed to governments andstate agencies means that these countries can't benefit fullyfrom the so-called Brady initiative that was launched in1989. The initiative switched the focus of the debt strategyfrom new lending by banks toward the lowering of countries'commercial bank debt.   Mr. Beregovoy has criticized the Brady initiative'sshortcomings in the past, saying it is too slow to implementand has limited effectiveness.   Since the autumn of 1988, France has been proposing thecreation of an escrow fund that would guarantee the paymentof principal and interest on securities created bydebt-conversion operations.   A recent study by the IMF and the World Bank has concludedthat the Brady initiative hasn't worked as well as had beenhoped, chiefly due to the lack of sufficient resources andthe lack of support from commercial banks.</TEXT></DOC>
