The events showed the variety and gravity of the ethnic quarrelsfaced by Soviet rulers, who issued proposals Thursday on interethnicrelations. Those proposals gave vague promises of decentralizationbut no specific remedies for the nation's often bloody nationaliststrife.   In Estonia, where tens of thousands of ethnic Russian workershave been on strike for nine days, their organizers met with topCommunist Party and government officials, including EstonianPresident Arnold Ruutel, in an attempt to negotiate an end to theconflict, the Tass news agency said.   ``We'll go back to work immediately if we get the guarantees wewant from Estonian leaders,'' Alexei Gutenov, a representative ofthe strike committee, said by telephone from Tallinn, the Balticrepublic's capital.   The strike broke out because the Estonian parliament voted toapprove the first residency requirements in the Soviet Union forvoting and running for office. Strike leaders claim the new lawwould strip 80,000 Russians and other migrants in Estonia of theright to vote or seek elective office.   The national Presidium on Wednesday declared the Estonian lawunconstitutional in a decision approved by President Mikhail S.Gorbachev. ``We'll end the walkout if Estonian leaders agree toabide by the Presidium's decision and change the law,'' Gutenov said.   Strike leaders claimed more than 50 enterprises in the republicof 1.6 million people have been shut by their action. Another joinedthe strike Thursday, Gutenov said.   Izvestia, the government daily, quouted Railway Minister N.Konarev as saying that because of the strike, 3,000 railcars havebeen idled in Estonia, of which more than 700 have been left onrailway lines, blocking dozens of trains from proceeding.   In Tallinn, where all stations that load and unload freight havebeen paralyzed by the walkout, 34 trains carrying perishablefoodstuffs and other goods are waiting to be discharged, Konarevsaid.   According to Tass, the strike committee has said the question ofwhether or nt to suspend the strike will be decided by a vote.   Russian workers also flexed their muscles in Moldavia, a smallSoviet republic on the border with Romania. Frightened by a proposedlaw that would make Moldavian the republic's official language,Russian workers in Tiraspol, Moldavia's second-largest city, stageda two-hour ``warning strike'' Wednesday.   Tass said the working people of Tiraspol and in other Moldaviancities where non-Moldavians make up nearly 40 percent of thepopulation demanded the language proposal be changed to protecttheir interests.   ``We're convinced strikes are an extreme measure of resolvinglabor disputes,'' Sergei Mikhailov, a strike leader in Tiraspol,told Tass. ``But the alarming sociopolitical situation in Moldaviaforced us to do it.''   Russians and other non-Moldavians fear they will be put at adisadvantage if the proposed law requires a knowledge of the locallanguage for those seeking certain jobs.   Similar measures have been enacted in the Baltic republics, andRussians in Moldavia fear the language law will be the first stepdown the same road pursued by nationalist activist in Estonia,Latvia and Lithuania. Moldavia's parliament is scheduled to meetAug. 29 to debate the measure.   Ethnic strife in the Soviet Caucasus republic of Azerbaijan hasalso disrupted rail service as far north as the Volga basin, theIzvestia report said. Last year, Armenians and Azerbaijanis began along, bloody quarrel over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostlyArmenian enclave inside Azerbaijan.   Izvestia said a railway bridge had been destroyed nearStepanakert, the enclave's administrative center. Earlier this week,about 200 people surged onto the tracks at Velidag in an attempt todisrupt rail service, it said. Near Karchivan, Azerbaijan, somebodytried to blow up the railbed ``but blew himself up while trying toplace the bomb,'' Izvestia said.</TEXT></DOC>
