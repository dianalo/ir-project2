PLC to 22.5 percent but no more, and will not seekrepresentation on the board of directors, an official of thePersian Gulf nation's investment arm said Friday.   The remarks, by the chief investment manager of the KuwaitInvestment Office, were the first direct statements of Kuwait'simmediate intentions toward BP.   Industry analysts disagreed on the Arab country's motives. Somesaid they believed Kuwait's previous assertations that it wassimply buying the shares as an investment.   Others suggested it was buying the stake as a first step in aneffort to establish closer ties, ultimately giving Kuwait access toBP's extensive refining and marketing operations in Europe and theUnited States.   The Kuwaiti agency raised speculation it was building on its19.53 percent stake by announcing early Friday that it held 1.269billion BP shares, or 21.25 percent.   The stake breached the 20 percent level BP has said isacceptable.   ``KIO policy with regard to all its investments is to regardthem as investments and not as a means of influencing the policy ofthe company in question,'' said the Kuwait office's chiefinvestment manager, Trevor Ball. ``This is equally so in the caseof BP.''   ``The KIO looks on this as a long term holding in a company forwhose management and policy KIO have a high regard and which it isconfident will act in the interests of shareholders,'' he said.``For that reason KIO doesn't propose to seek representation on itsboard.''   The Kuwait office said it will increase its stake to a target22.5 percent as soon as market conditions permit. BP refused tocomment on the situation Friday.   Jeremy Elden, an oil analyst at the British brokerage Phillipsand Drew, said Kuwait originally intended to build up a 25 percentstake in BP.   Elden said the 22.5 percent target stake ``looks like a classiccompromise'' worked out between between BP chairman Sir PeterWalters and Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah.   Kuwait had hoped for a 25 percent stake in BP because that wouldgive it the right to block special resolutions put to BPshareholders, Elden said. The resolutions have to receive approvalof at least 75 percent of the stockholders.   ``That would have given them real power over the company, ifthey had ever wanted to exercise it,'' Elden said.   In Milwaukee, Wis., George J. Gaspar, an analyst with the RobertW. Baird andamp; Co. securities firm, said he thought Kuwait eventuallyhopes to ``trade its stock for a position in BP's downstreamoperations.   ``They keep saying it's only for investment, but I don't believeit,'' he said. ``I think Kuwait is going to use its investment inBP to encourage some joint operation between the two.''   Kuwait is just one of several large producers to have takensteps in the direction of acquiring interests that would provideguaranteed long-term outlets for their supplies.   Texaco Inc. and Saudi Arabia are in the midst of negotiating ajoint venture involving Texaco's refining and marketing operations.   Those talks come less than two years after Venezuela acquiredhalf of Southland Corp.'s Citgo Petroleum Co. refinery operations,an interest in Champlain Oil in the United States, and otherventures in Europe.   Not all industry-watchers agree with Gaspar's theory, however.   Stephen Smith, an analyst at Bear Stearns andamp; Co., said hebelieved Kuwait's BP stake is ``just an investment.''   ``Kuwait's got plenty of channels for its refined productsalready,'' he said. ``They've done at least two, maybe three dealsfor outlets in Europe, where they're selling their products underthe name, Q8.''   The Kuwaiti office began accumulating BP shares soon after BP's2.7 billion pound share offering was massively undersubscribed lastOctober. In February it declared a 19.53 percent stake, or 1.165billion shares.   Walters indicated in February that he viewed the Kuwait office'sstake as acceptable provided the office didn't increase its holdingbeyond 20 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
