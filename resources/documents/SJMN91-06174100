Lately hehas been using a blowtorch to join copper water pipes -- tees, fittings,connectors and elbows.;    He's not making house calls. He's making vases,candlesticks, chandeliers and sconces for his &quot;Fire and Water&quot; home designcollection.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ARCHITECT WELDS COPPER PIPES, FITTINGS INTOWORK OF ART WITH APLOMB  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Stylemakers  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;My approach welds high-tech design to found objects,&quot; Bergman says. &quot;I usethe plumber's kit to reinterpret objects that are normally highly refined,polished and ornamented. I solder parts as a plumber would and hand-sand thescorch marks. It's not the jeweler's approach.&quot;;    The roughed-up look of theexposed joinery against the warm, burnished finish provides the vital creativetension. A wax finish prevents oxidation.;    &quot;I have a transformational eye,&quot;Bergman said. &quot;At construction sites, I find myself thinking, 'What a shamethat copper ends up buried in walls.' This fall, I saw a Deco candlestick --copper -- at a flea market, just as I was panicking to come up with Christmaspresents, fast. All the odd pieces suddenly fit together.&quot;;    &quot;The averagearchitectural project takes a year, from blueprint to three dimensions,&quot; hesaid. &quot;This gives me the joy of seeing a design realized in hours.&quot;;    Three-and four-unit candelabra are $100 to $140. They are available at Ad HocSoftwares in New York, the Whitney Museum's Store Next Door, or from DavidBergman Architect, New York, N.Y. 10002; (212) 475-3106.;    Bergman's otherdesigns include a &quot;Ben Franklin&quot; television cart with a decorativelightning-bolt slash down the back that holds the electric cords.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910622  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  18D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  259  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday June 22, 199100174100,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
