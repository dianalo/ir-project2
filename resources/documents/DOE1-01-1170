Improvementof efficiency by the investigation of economics making the best use ofthe effect of scaling-up and using various grades of coal as well asthe new technologies such as supercritical pressure system, energy conservationand integrated automatic operation system have been adopted. The concentrationof NOx in the exhaust gas is as low as 150 ppm or under without installingdenitration facilities based on the new pulverized coal firing equipmentfor lowering NOx. The environmental measures such as the exhaust gasdesulphurizer, electrostatic precipitator and ash land fill site aresufficiently secured. The performance of this unit was confirmed by thetest operation, firing identification test and experience of operation.The gloss thermal efficiency is on the highest level as much as 42.57%.The know-how on firing the imported coal has been accumulated. The unitis at present operated smoothly at a high rate for the base load to contributeto the stable supply and cost reduction. (12 figs, 5 tabs, 1 photo)</TEXT></DOC>
