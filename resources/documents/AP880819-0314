Federal Home Loan Bank Board spokesman David Colgren said thegovernment estimates it will spend another $3 billion over the nextdecade, bring its total infusion to $5.5 billion by 1998.   The merger, outlined by the FHLBB, is the biggest under thegovernment's ``Southwest Plan,'' which is designed to eliminateailing Sandamp;Ls in the region through consolidations. It alsorespresents the largest bailout in the thrift industry.   The announcement comes a day after federal regulators said theysold 12 insolvent Sandamp;Ls in Texas to an investment group headed byWilliam Gibson, a Continental Illinois Corp. vice president. TheFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. had promised to put up$1.3 billion in government assistance, while the private sectorcontributed $48 million in cash.   The thrifts combined Thursday form the new institution ofAmerican Federal Bank F.S.B., which will be based in Dallas.   In the latest deal, the combined thrift will have assets of $6.9billion and will be called Sunbelt Savings F.S.B., borrowing itsname from Dallas-based Sunbelt Savings Association, which was oneof the eight merged thrifts. Sunbelt lost $1.2 billion in the firstquarter of this year, a record for the industry.   The new institution will be headed by Thomas J. Wageman, who hasbeen managing the state-chartered Sunbelt Savings Association forthe past two years.   The FSLIC, which is providing a $2.5 billion note to eliminatethe losses of the consolidated institution, says it plans to shrinkSunbelt's size with the intention of selling it to investors nextyear.   ``Once we finally implement consolidation and untangle the loanparticipations, the surviving institutions will be much moreattractive to a buyer,'' FHLBB Chairman M. Danny Wall said in astatement.   ``It is in our best interest and that of depositors and othersin the Texas thrift industry for us to shrink these institutions totheir core business ...''   The bank board said depositors of the eight merged thrifts willbe able to conduct business as usual because all branches of theformer institutions are now operating as officers of the newSunbelt. It said the same contracted rates and terms on allcertificates of deposit will continue to be honored.   Besides Sunbelt Savings Association Texas, the other thriftsinvolved were Western Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, aDallas-based Sandamp;L which ranked 12th in losses for the first quarter,and Independent American Savings Association of Irving, ranked 20thin first-quarter losses.   The other institutions involved included: First City SavingsAssociation of Irving; Federated Savings andamp; Loan of Brady; MultibancSavings Association of Alice; Texana Savings andamp; Loan Association,Texarkana; and Summit Savings Association of Dallas.   George Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ofDallas, said the consolidation is ``another FSLIC initiative tostabilize the thrift industry in Texas,'' which has been hard hitby slumping oil and real estate markets.   The transaction brings to 20 the number of insolvent thrifts inTexas that have been eliminated this week and 32 since theSouthwest Plan began three months ago. When the plan began, 109Texas thrifts were insolvent.   Wall said Thursday the FHLBB expected to complete the plan atthe end of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
