(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mick Jagger took the witness standThursday to defend his hit song ``Just Another Night'' against areggae musician's charge of plagiarism, saying the first time heheard the other man's song was after the lawsuit was filed.   Jagger that he he started in music 25 years ago in England, hehad composed 200 to 300 songs, both alone and with Keith Richards,guitarist in the Rolling Stones.   Reggae musician Patrick Alley, 36, of New York City, is suingJagger, claiming the famed Rolling Stone took the chorus fromAlley's 1979 song, also called ``Just Another Night,'' and used itin Jagger's 1985 solo hit.   Jagger's testimony came on the fourth day of the trial. Jaggertold the jury that the first time he heard Alley's song was in hisattorney's office in 1986 after the lawsuit was filed.   His attorney, Peter Parcher, asked Jagger what he thought of thesong and he said, ``I don't want to cast aspersion on Mr. Alley. Alot of people in this courtroom don't like my music. Personally, Idon't really like that song.''   Jagger testified that he often recorded songs by other artistsand had no hesitation in giving them credit.   For more than an hour, the jury and a courtroom filled with fansand reporters heard how Jagger developed his song, beginning with aNovember 1983 tape, which Jagger described as ``just me, withacoustic guitar, starting off with this tune.''   Several tapes were played, detailing how Jagger, other musiciansand arranger Carlos Alomar developed the song into the form thatwould ultimately appear on his 1985 solo album, ``She's the Boss.''   Jagger rocked back and forth to the beat as the tapes played,sometimes seeming embarrassed as, on the tape, he grunted or madeother sounds as substitutes for lyrics.   He said that on none of the tapes did drummer Sly Dunbar appear.Dunbar, who appeared on the final cut of Jagger's song, allegedlywas the drummer on Alley's song in 1979. Dunbar has testified thathe couldn't remember.   Alley's lawyers say Jagger's song netted as much as $6 million.   The courtroom had been set up with amplifying equipment inanticipation that Jagger would perform, but that did not occurThursday.   Another of Jagger's attorneys, Gerald Margolis, said, ``He'llplay if he has to, if the only way to prove it and show it, hewill.''   Jagger was scheduled to resume testifying Friday afternoon.   Earlier Thursday, a music expert testified on his behalf thatthe two songs were very different and that the title, ``JustAnother Night,'' was fairly common.   Daniel Ricigliano, chairman of the theory department at theManhattan School of Music, said that while the rhythmical settingsof the two choruses were similar because of the similarity oflyrics and ideas, the choruses were ``totally different'' in everymusical way.   He testified that a review of song titles at the Performing ArtsLibrary in Lincoln Center revealed more than a dozen songs since1928 with the title ``Just Another Night.''   Earlier in the week, Alley's expert witness, Juilliard teacherAndrew William Thomas, said his analysis of the songs found thechoruses to be ``virtually identical.''   Outside court Wednesday, Jagger had said: ``My credibility is onthe line because of this. ... I think it's pretty obvious toeveryone that the songs are entirely different aside from a fewwords and the title.''   He called the trial a ``ridiculous waste of time.''   Alley's chorus lyrics are, ``Can I spend another, just anothernight, just another night, just another night with you.''   Jagger's lines are, ``Give me just another night, just anothernight with you. Give me just another kiss, just before the dawnbreaks through.''   The jury is to determine only whether there was an infringementof Alley's copyright. If the jury finds in Alley's favor, theparties can arrange a settlement on damages or can have damagesdetermined at a second trial.</TEXT></DOC>
