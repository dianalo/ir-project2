The five warehouses employ about 5,500 people.    The planned closings are the most severe cost-cutting steps taken in recent memory by the nation's largest retailer. The rising cost of operating an 82-year-old distribution system has been partly responsible for Sears's eroding ability to compete against discount store chains. Sears predicted that the moves will trim $150 million from its annual costs by 1991.    Sears said it will take a $20 million net charge in the first quarter for costs related to the closings. A Sears spokesman didn't exclude the possibility of related charges in the future. For the year-earlier first quarter, Sears earned $195.3 million, or 52 cents a share, on revenue of $9.39 billion.    Sears said it will close its oldest warehouse first. The Chicago complex, which processed catalog orders before spawning the first Sears retail store, will be shut down April 30. Most of its 1,800 employees will take early retirement or be dismissed, Sears said.    Sears said it plans to shutter its Boston warehouse complex early next year and then close its distribution facilities in Atlanta, Memphis, Tenn., and Minneapolis some time after 1988. Sears said its warehouses in Boston, Atlanta and Memphis each have 1,000 jobs while the Minneapolis center employs about 700 people. A Sears spokeswoman said it wasn't clear how many will be employed at the four warehouses by the time they are shut.    Under the plan, Sears will continue to operate warehouses in Columbus, Ohio; Dallas; Greensboro, N.C.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and Kansas City, Mo. Sears said it is also studying whether to renovate or relocate its warehouse operations in Los Angeles and Philadelphia.    A Sears spokesman said the company plans to make &quot;significant expenditures&quot; to upgrade the surviving warehouses. He wouldn't elaborate.    The company said it can close the five regional warehouses without straining distribution to its stores. The Sears retail chain needs less storage space because its stores are displaying more merchandise and stocking less, as well as using just-in-time delivery for promotion merchandise, the spokesman said.    The move is the biggest step Sears has taken in a recent campaign to cut operating costs. Last year, Sears consolidated its four regional administrative merchandise territories into two.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Sears closed at $52.25, up $1. </TEXT></DOC>
