Two follow-up workshops were held in1987. Each included a presentation of study findings, panel discussionson policy and financing issues, a question and answer session, and asummary session; the New Delhi workshop also included a technical session.The report on the two workshops details views expressed by participantson constraints to NUPG, together with recommendations to overcome them.The main issues discussed were the adequacy of government policy regardingboth NUPG and captive generation (electricity generation by a non-utilityentity for its own use, rather than sale to the grid) and the difficultyof financing power projects. The problems of availability, quality, andprice of fuels and equipment and interconnection with the grid were alsodiscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
