Accordingly, this notice will bepublished four times in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>A. Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, provides amechanism whereby the NRC may transfer to the States certain regulatoryauthority over agreement materials \1\<NOTE/> when a State desires to assume this authority and the Governorcertifies that the State has an adequate regulatory program, and when theCommission finds that the State's program is compatible with that of theNRC and is adequate to protect the public health and safety. Section 274gdirects the Commission to cooperate with the States in the formulationof standards for protection against radiation hazards to assure that Stateand Commission programs for radiation protection will be coordinated andcompatible. Further, section 274j provides that the Commission shall periodicallyreview such agreements and actions taken by the States under the agreementsto ensure compliance with the provisions of this section.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ A.

Special nuclear materials in quantities not sufficient to forma critical mass</ITAG>B. On March 29, 1984, the Governor of Utah signed an agreement with theNRC for the assumption of regulatory authority for byproduct material asdefined in section 11e.(1) of the Act, source material and special nuclearmaterial in quantities not sufficient to form a critical mass. In a letterdated July 17, 1989, Governor Norman H. Bangerter of the State of Utahrequested that the Commission enter into an amended agreement with theState pursuant to section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,under which the State would also assume responsibility for regulating theland disposal of these materials received from other persons. The Governorcertified that the State of Utah has a program for control of radiationhazards which is adequate to protect the public health and safety withrespect to the materials within the State covered by the proposed amendmentto the agreement, and that the State of Utah desires to assume regulatoryresponsibility for such materials. The text of the proposed agreement isshown in Appendix A.The specific authority requested is for permanent disposal of low-levelwaste containing the material for which Utah has assumed regulatory authorityunder the 1984 agreement but not containing uranium and thorium mill tailings(byproduct material as defined in section 11e.(2) of the Act). The Statedoes not wish to assume authority over uranium recovery activities. TheState, however, reserves the right to apply at a future date to NRC foran amended agreement to assume authority in this area. The proposed amendmentto the agreement covers the following areas:1. Amending Article I of the Agreement of March 29, 1984 to add land disposalof source, byproduct and special nuclear material received from other personsto the list of materials covered by the agreement.2. Amending Article II of the Agreement of March 29, 1984 to delete landdisposal of source, by product and special nuclear material received fromother persons from the list of materials and activities over which theCommission continues to retain regulatory authority and responsibility.3. Specifies the effective date of the amended agreement.C. Utah Code Annotated (UCA) 26-1-27 through 26-1-29 authorizes the StateDepartment of Health to issue licenses to, and perform inspections of (see,also, UCA 26-23-8), users of radioactive materials under the 1984 agreementand otherwise carry out a total radiation control program. Utah RadiationControl Rules UCA-10 through UCA-80 adopted November 8, 1982 under authorityof 26-1-27 through 26-1-29 Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended, providestandards, licensing, inspection, enforcement and administrative proceduresfor agreement and non-agreement materials. These regulations have beendetermined to be compatible with the Commission's regulations. Utah RadiationControl Rules R447-10 through R447-70 were amended and recodified in July1989. Regulations R447-25 were adopted in July 1988 for licensing requirementsfor land disposal of radioactive waste.D. On March 29, 1984, under enabling legislation in UCA 26-1-29, Utah assumedregulatory authority for byproduct material as defined in section 11e.(1)of the Act, source material and special nuclear material in quantitiesnot sufficient to form a critical mass. The program audits conducted sincethat time have resulted in an NRC finding that the Utah radiation controlprogram is compatible with that of the NRC and is adequate to protect publichealth and safety. In addition to Utah's agreement program, Utah is involvedin several environmental radiation issues including monitoring indoor radon,monitoring uranium mill tailings, particularly at the Vitro uranium mill,and monitoring and assessment of the State environmental program. In addition,the Department issued to Envirocare of Utah, Inc., a license to receive,store, and dispose, by shallow land burial, naturally occurring radioactivematerial (NORM) waste with a radium-226 concentration not to exceed 2,000picocuries per gram. NORM material is not regulated by the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission.E. The State's proposed programs for low-level radioactive waste disposalare assessed under Criteria numbers 9, ``Radioactive Waste Disposal'' and20 ``Qualification of Regulatory and Inspection Personnel.'' Additionalcriteria relating to prior evaluation of uses of radioactive materials,inspection and administration,2<NOTE/> are addressed as appropriate to supplement information foundin the staff assessment of the original Utah proposed agreement publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 30, 1983 (48 FR 57674-57684).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>2 Criteria 13, ``Prior Evaluation of Hazards and Uses Exceptions,''14, ``Evaluation Criteria,'' 16, ``Inspection, Purpose, Frequency,'' and27, ``Coverage, Amendments reciprocity.''<ITAG tagnum="84">II.

Radioactive Waste Disposal.</ITAG>(a) Waste disposal by material users. The standards for the disposal ofradioactive materials into the air, water and sewer, and burial in thesoil shall be in accordance with 10 CFR part 20. Holders of radioactivematerial desiring to release or dispose of quantities or concentrationsof radioactive materials in excess of prescribed limits shall be requiredto obtain special permission from the appropriate regulatory authority.Requirements for transfer of waste for the purpose of ultimate disposalat a land disposal facility (waste transfer and manifest system) shallbe in accordance with 10 CFR part 20.The waste disposal standards shall include a waste classification schemeand provisions for waste form, applicable to waste generators, that isequivalent to that contained in 10 CFR part 61.(b) Land Disposal of waste received from other persons. The State shallpromulgate regulations containing licensing requirements for land disposalof radioactive waste received from other persons which are compatible withthe applicable technical definitions, performance objectives, technicalrequiremetns and applicable supporting sections set forth in 10 CFR part61. Adequate financial arrangements (under terms established by regulation)shall be required of each waste disposal site licensee to ensure sufficientfunds for decontamination, closure and stabilization of a disposal site.In addition, Agreement State financial arrangements for long-term monitoringand maintenance of a specific site must be reviewed and approved by theCommission prior to relieving the site operator of licensed responsibility(section 151(a)(2), Pub. L. 97-425).The Utah regulations contain provisions relating to the disposal of radioactivematerials into the air, water ans sewer and burial in soil which are essentiallyuniform with those of 10 CFR part 20. Waste transfer and manifest systemrequirements for transfer of waste for ultimate disposal at a land disposalfacility are included in the Utah regulations. The waste disposal requirementsinclude a waste classification scheme and provisions for waste form equivalentto that in 10 CFR part 61.The Utah regulations provide for land disposal of low-level radioactivewaste received from other persons which are compatible with the applicabletechnical definitions, performance objectives, technical requirements andsupporting sections set out in 10 CFR part 61. The Utah regulations includeprovisions for financial arrangements for decontamination, closure andstabilization. Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-425),the financial arrangements for long term monitoring and maintenance atspecific sites in Utah will be subject to Commission review and approvalprior to Utah relieving the site operator of licensed responsibility.References: URC-R447-15-310, URC-R447-15-302, URC-R447-15-303, URC-R447-304,URC-R447-15-304, URC-R447-15-306, URC-R447-15-307, URC-R447-15-308, URC-R447-15-309,URC-R447-15-311, URC-R447-25; Section 151(a)(2), Pub. L. 97-425.Prior Evaluation of Uses of Radioactive Materials<ITAG tagnum="81">13. Prior Evaluation of Hazards and Uses, Exceptions</ITAG>In the present state of knowledge, it it necessary in regulating the possessionand use of byproduct, source and special nuclear materials that the Stateregulatory authority require the submission of information on, and evaluationof, the potential hazards and the capability of the user or possessor priorto his receipt of the materials. This criterion is subject to certain exceptionsand to continuing reappraisal as knowledge and experience in the atomicenergy field increase. Frequently there are, and increasingly in the futurethere may be, categories of materials and uses as to which there is sufficientknowledge to permit possession and use without prior evaluation of thehazards and the capability of the possessor and user. These categoriesfall into two groups_those materials and uses which may be completely exemptfrom regulatory controls, and those materials and uses in which sanctionsfor misuse are maintained without pre-evaluation of the individual possessionor use. In authorizing research and development or other activities involvingmultiple uses of radioactive materials, where an institution has peoplewith extensive training and experience, the State regulatory authoritymay wish to provide a means for authorizing broad use of materials withoutevaluating each specific use.Prior to the issuance of a specific license for the disposal of radioactivematerials, the Utah Bureau of Radiation Control will required the submissionof information on, and will make an evaluation of, the potential hazardsof such uses, and the capability of the applicant.References: URC-447-25, Utah Program Statement, section III.D ``Proceduresfor Review of a Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal License Application.''<ITAG tagnum="81">14. Evaluation Criteria</ITAG>In evaluating a proposal to use radioactive materials, the regulatory authorityshall determine the adequacy of the applicant's facilities and safety equipment,his training and experience in the use of the materials for the purposerequested, and his proposed administrative controls. States should developguidance documents for use by license applicants. This guidance shouldbe consistent with NRC licensing and regulatory guides for various categoriesof licensed activities.In evaluating a proposal for disposal of radioactive material, the UtahBureau of Radiation Control will make the findings required by URC-R447-25-11,including, among other, findings that the issuance of the license willnot constitute an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of the publicand that the applicant is qualified by reason of training and experienceto carry out the disposal operations requested in a manner that protectshealth and minimizes danger to life or property.Other special requirements for the issiance of specific licenses are containedin the regulations.References: URC-R447-25, <T3>see,</T3> especially, R447-25-11, Utah Program Statement, Section III.D.``Procedures for Review of a Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal LicenseApplication.''Inspection<ITAG tagnum="81">16. Purpose, Frequency</ITAG>The possession and use of radioactive materials shall be subject to inspectionby the regulatory authority and shall be subject to the performance oftests, as required by the regulatory authority. Inspection and testingis conducted to determine and to assist in obtaining compliance with regulatoryrequirements. Frequency of inspection shall be related directly to theamount and kind of material and type of operation licensed, and it shallbe adequate to insure compliance.Utah low-level waste disposal icensees will be subject to inspection bythe Bureau of Radiation Control. Upon instruction from the Bureau, licenseesshall perform or permit the Bureau to perform such reasonable tests andsurveys as the Bureau deems appropriate or necessary. The frequency ofinspections is dependent upon the type and scope of the licensed activitiesand will be at least as frequent as inspections of similar licensees byNRC. Generally, inspections will be unannounced.References: Utah Program Statement, section III.E ``Compliance Programfor a Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Facility.''Personnel<ITAG tagnum="81">20. Qualifications of Regulatory and Inspection Personnel</ITAG>The regulatory agency shall be staffed with sufficient trained personnel.Prior evaluation of applications for licenses or authorizations and inspectionof licensees must be conducted by persons possessing the training and experiencerelevant to the type and level of radioactivity in the proposed use tobe evaluated and inspected. This requires competency to evaluate variouspotential radiological hazards associated with the many uses of radioactivematerial and includes concentrations of radioactive materials in air andwater, conditions of shielding, the making of radiation measurements, knowledgeof radiation instruments_their selection, use, and calibration_laboratorydesign, contamination control, other general principles and practices ofradiation protection, and use of management controls in assuring adherenceto safety procedures. In order to evaluate some complex cases, the Stateregulatory staff may need to be supplemented by consultants or other Stateagencies with expertise in geology, hydrology, water quality, radiobiology,and engineering disciplines.1To perform the functions involved in evaluationand inspection, it is desirable that there be personnel educated and trainedin the physical and/or life sciences, including biology, chemistry, physicsand engineering, and that the personnel have had training and experiencein radiation protection. For example, the person who will be responsiblefor the actual performance of evaluation and inspection of all of the varioususes of byproduct, source and special nuclear materials which might cometo the regulatory body should have substantial training and extensive experiencein the field of radiation protection. It is desirable that such a personhave a bachelor's degree or equivalent in the physical or life sciences,and specific training in radiation protection.1It is recognized that therewill also be persons performing a more limited function in evaluation andinspection. These pesons will perform the day-to-day work of the regulatoryprogram and deal with both routine situations as well as some which willbe out of the ordinary. These persons should have a bachelor's degree orequivalent in the physical or life sciences, training in health physics,and approximately two years of actual work experience in the field of radiationprotection.1The foregoing are considered desirable qualifications for thestaff who will be responsible for the actual performance of evaluationand inspection. In addition, there will probably be trainees associatedwith regulatory program who will have an academic background in the physicalor life sciences as well as varying amounts of specific training in radiationprotection but little or no actual work experience in this field. The backgroundand specific training of these persons will indicate to some extent theirpotential role in the regulatory program. These trainees, of course, couldbe used initially to evaluate and inspect those applications of radioactivematerials which are considered routine or more standardized from the ratiationsafety standpoint, for example, inspection of industrial gauges, smallresearch programs, and diagnostic medical programs. As they gain experienceand competence in the field, trainees could be used progressively to dealwith the more complex or difficult types of radioactive material applications.It is desirable that such trainees have a bachelor's degree or equivalentin the physical or life sciences and specific training in radiation protection.In determining the requirement for academic training of individuals inall of the foregoing categories proper consideration should be given toequivalent competency which has been gained by appropriate technical andradiation protection experience.It is recognized that radioactive materials and their uses are so variedthat the evaluation and inspection functions will require skills and experiencein the different disciplines which will not always reside in one person.The regulatory authority should have the composite of such skills eitherin its employ or as its command, not only for routine functions, but alsofor emergency cases.<T3>Licensing and Regulation of Permanent Disposal of Low-Level RadioactiveWaste_(a) </T3><T3>Number of Personnel_</T3> (a) <T3>Number of Personnel. </T3>There are approximately 230 specific licensesin the State of Utah. The Bureau of Radiation Control has responsibilityfor the low-level waste (LLW) management regulatory program as a jointfunction of Radioactive Materials and Machine Licensing Section and EnvironmentalMonitoring and Mill Tailings Management Section. The assessment of theregulatory framework is included under Criterion 9, ``Radioactive WasteDisposal.''
