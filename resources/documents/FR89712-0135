Revisions to the existing regulationare necessary to ensure efficient processing and proper protection of businessinformation received by NHTSA. This action is intended to clarify certainprovision, to revise certain sections to conform to statutory and caselaw, to include additional class determinations and to respond to a petitionfrom General Motors Corporation recommending that the agency consider addinga presumptive class determination. The agency requests comments on theproposed changes discussed in this notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received by August 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should refer to the docket and notice numbersset forth above and be submitted (preferably in 10 copies) to the DocketSection, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Room 5109, 400Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.

Telephone: (202) 366-1834.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>NHTSA published Part 512, entitled``Confidential Business Information,'' a final rule on June 7, 1982, 47FR 24587. This regulation has not been amended or revised since that time.The agency believes that the procedures for submitting confidential businessinformation have generally worked well since 1982, but practical experiencein processing this information has shown that some improvements and clarificationsshould be considered. The modifications being proposed are described below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assertion of Claim</ITAG>The agency is proposing to require that submitters of allegedly confidentialbusiness information submit two copies of the documents containing suchinformation instead of one. This proposed amendment to andSection; 512.4(a)(4)of the regulation would permit the agency's technical staff to utilizeone copy of the information while the second copy is being evaluated bythe Chief Counsel pursuant to the submitter's claim for confidentiality.Since the submitted material is being reproduced for the agency by thesubmitter in the first instance, the agency believes that the submitteris in a better position to make a second copy initially than is the agencyafter the material has been received. This change will expedite the processingof confidentiality requests at the agency and constitute a minimal burdenupon the submitter.This proposal excepts blueprints from the requirement for two copies because(1) the current regulation presumptively determines that the disclosureof blueprints will likely result in competitive harm; and (2) blueprintsare generally bulky and difficult to copy without extra expense and effort.The presumption normally allows for expedited processing of claims forconfidentiality relating to blueprints which makes the extra expense andeffort for copying them unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Claim of Confidentiality for Privileged Information</ITAG>The agency is proposing to insert the term ``privileged'' in andSection;512.4(b)(3)(i) and andSection; 512.5. These proposed changes would modifythe regulation to conform more closely to the language of Exemption 4 ofthe Freedom of Information Act (the ``Act''), 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). Althoughthe term ``privileged'' was omitted from the original regulation, the agencyhas consistently followed the applicable judicial decisions construingthe Act, which includes this term. This amendment will permit the agencyto avoid the appearance of being unwilling to consider future claims forconfidential treatment based solely upon ``privilege,'' as such claimsmay be recognized under applicable case law.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impairment of Protectable Government Interests</ITAG>Courts have determined that in some instances business information maybe protected from disclosure in order to protect an identifiable governmentinterest, <T3>9 to 5 Organization for Women Office Workers</T3> v. <T3>Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System</T3>, 721 F.2d 1 (1stCir. 1983); <T3>National Parks andamp; Conservation Association</T3> v. <T3>Morton,</T3> 498 F.2d 765, 770 n. 17 (D.C. Cir. 1974). The agency proposesto add andSection; 512.5(c) in recognition of this additional consideration.This proposed change would also be reflected in andSection; 512.4(b)(3)(viii).<ITAG tagnum="84">Submitter's Supporting Certification</ITAG>Under the current regulation, submitters of allegedly confidential informationmust submit a certification that a diligent inquiry has been made to insurethat the information has not been disclosed, or appeared publicly. AppendixA to the regulation requires that the certification take the form of anaffidavit. NHTSA believes that it is important for submitters to make specialinquiries about the nature of the information being submitted to avoidthe making of frivolous claims. However, the use of an affidavit may beunduly burdensome for many submitters since the same purposes may be affectedthrough the use of a certification which need not be notarized. See 28U.S.C. 1746 and 18 U.S.C. 1001. Accordingly, the agency proposes to replacethe form of affidavit in Appendix A with a form of certification. Nevertheless,the agency would continue to accept affidavits which contain the statementscontained in the proposed Appendix A.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reconsideration Request Procedures </ITAG>A new section, andSection; 512.7, entitled ``Petitions for reconsiderationupon denial of a request for confidential treatment,'' is proposed, andandSection; 512.6 is reorganized. This new section provides for essentiallythe same procedures established by the present regulation at andSection;512.6(g), but the agency believes that the new provisions clarify questionsthat may arise concerning specific issues, such as extension requests andnotification to the submitter of the agency's decision. Proposed andSection;512.7(a) provides specifically that determinations responding to petitionsfor reconsideration will be administratively final. To insure that submittershave a full opportunity to present their justification to the agency, wepropose to remove the limitation that petitions may be based only uponinformation or arguments not available at the time of the original request.Nevertheless, we continue to encourage submitters to include all relevantinformation with the initial submission to avoid unnecessary correspondenceand duplicative work.<ITAG tagnum="84">New Class Determinations </ITAG>The agency proposes to add new class determinations in Appendix B to thetypes of information that would presumptively be likely to result in substantialcompetitive harm if publicly disclosed. Based upon the agency's experiencewith the regulation over the past six years, it is proposed that the presumptionsapply to projected production as well as sales figures for vehicles. Protectionwill be granted only until the end of the model year to which the informationpertains because experience has shown that vehicle figures become availablethrough public sources, such as trade publications, at that time. The agency also tentatively concludes that protection for model specificproduct plans should be revised. Confidential treatment of product plansunder the agency's proposal would be limited to the beginning of the applicablemodel year since product plans lose their competitive value once the productline is introduced. Submitters would continue to be required under the proposed regulation,andSection; 512.4(i) (currently andSection; 512.4(h)) to notify the agencyof any information, previously determined to be confidential, which becomespublicly available, as well as to submit the certification required underandSection; 512.4(e). NHTSA has received a petition from General Motors Corporation to amendthe class determinations in Appendix B to include cost information as atype of information that would presumptively be likely to result in substantialcompetitive harm if disclosed to the public. The following language wassuggested:<ITAG tagnum="21">Cost information relating to any aspect of product cost, includingbut not limited to purchased material costs, labor costs, equipment costs,and wholesale parts costs.</ITAG>In the petition, General Motors cites several judicial decisions in whichvarious types of costs have been protected from disclosure and states thatthe agency typically grants confidential treatment for manufacturers' costinformation. They conclude that it is, therefore, a needless use of bothmanufacturer and agency resources to require the manufacturer to substantiate,and the agency to review, each claim for confidential treatment relatingto cost information. The General Motors petition has been placed in thepublic docket. NHTSA agrees that the agency has generally withheld actual detailed costinformation pursuant to Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act,especially as such data relate to development, distribution and product.However, we are concerned that General Motors' proposed language may beoverbroad because it does not distinguish between general cost estimatesor ranges of cost and specific actual cost data directly relating to theproduct. Moreover, certain kinds of cost information may already be inthe public domain or otherwise be widely disseminated among the retailautomobile dealerships of the company so that any confidentiality claimwould be effectively compromised. Nevertheless, we would like to receive comments from the public on theGeneral Motors proposal. We especially invite suggestions on how, if atall, a class determination could be drafted in a way that avoids impermissivelybroad language, without enumerating many detailed examples of confidentialcost information which have been approved by the courts.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous Revisions </ITAG>Revisions to other portions of the regulation have been proposed in orderto provide a clearer and more effective presentation. We have also attemptedto remove provisions that have become obsolete or have proved to be superfluous.We propose to remove references in the regulation to the term ``significantcompetitive damage,'' which is contained in Title V of the Motor VehicleInformation and Cost Savings Act, 15 U.S.C. 2001 <T3>et seq.</T3>, and to incorporate the phrase into the definition of``substantial competitive harm'' in andSection; 512.3. The proposal would also simplify portions of andSection; 512.6 pertainingto the timing of agency determinations and specifically provide that documentspurged of allegedly confidential information be placed directly in appropriatepublic files or dockets. In andSection; 512.4(j) (currently andSection; 512.4(i)) the agency proposesto remove the provision that the agency shall deny claims for confidentialtreatment that do not include the certification required by andSection; 512.4(e)because such a requirement is unnecessarily harsh. The agency tentativelyconcludes that it is sufficient that noncompliance with any of the provisionsin andSection; 512.4 may result in a denial of a claim for confidential treatment.The agency has determined that, under the current regulation, submittersmay technically rely on the presumptive class determinations in AppendixB in order to obtain more than two decisions from the Chief Counsel relatingto their claim for confidential treatment. This is discriminatory to othersubmitters, and there is potential for abuse of the process by making intentionallyerroneous presumptive classification claims. Therefore, the agency proposesthat the additional time granted to a submitter who relies on a class determinationbe removed from andSection; 512.4(c)(2)(ii), and that, like everyone else,such submitter receive only one opportunity for reconsideration.The agency also tentatively concludes that the definition relating to voluntarysubmissions in andSection; 512.5(a)(2) of the current regulation should bechanged to reflect more accurately the case law. The agency proposes toamend the language of andSection; 512.5(b) so that any apparent conflictbetween the regulation and the applicable judicial decisions is removed.Whether future submissions of information could be compelled is only afactor to be considered in deciding if governmental access to informationwill be impaired by disclosure, but it is not necessarily dispositive.<T3>Public Citizen Health Research Group </T3>v. <T3>FDA, </T3>704 F.2d 1280, 1291 n. 29 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <T3>Washington Post Co. </T3>v. <T3>HHS,</T3> 690 F.2d 252 (D.C. Cir. 1982).Finally, we propose to combine the sections currently numbered as andSection;andSection;512.8 and 512.10 into andSection; 512.9 of the regulation since both sectionsrelate to the conditions under which information claimed or determinedto be confidential may be released.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to comment on this proposal. All commentsmust be limited to 15 pages in length. Necessary attachments may be appendedto those submissions without regard to the 15 page limit. (49 CFR 553.21.)This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primaryarguments in a concise fashion.Written comments to the public docket must be received by August 21, 1989.All comments received before the close of business on the comment closingdate will be considered and will be available for examination in the docketat the above address before and after that date. To the extent possible,comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. However,the rulemaking action may proceed at any time after that date. NHTSA willcontinue to file relevant material in the docket as it becomes availableafter the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continueto examine the docket for new material.Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments inthe docket should enclose, in the envelope with their comments, a self-addressedstamped postcard. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor willreturn the postcard by mail.Copies of all comments will be placed in Docket 78-10; Notice 9 of theNHTSA Docket Section in Room 5109, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh StreetSW., Washington, DC 20590.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Assessment</ITAG>The agency has considered whether this action would have any federalismimplications. We have determined that this proposal would not have anyimpact upon the principles of federalism.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic and Other Effects</ITAG>NHTSA has analyzed the effect of this action and has determined that itis not ``major'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 or ``significant''within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policiesand procedures. The proposed amendments would have a minimal effect onsubmitters of alleged confidential information to the agency. This determinationhas been made because the regulation is essentially procedural. It willnot have an appreciable impact on the cost of seeking confidential treatmentfor data submitted to the agency. It will also not have an appreciableimpact on what information is or is not accorded confidential protection.Therefore, neither a draft Regulatory Analysis nor a Preliminary Evaluationis required.In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency has evaluatedthe effects of this rule on small entities. For the reasons stated above,I certify that this rule would not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, the preparation ofan Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is unnecessary.The requirements of Part 512 are considered to be information collectionrequirements as that term is defined by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) in 5 CFR Part 1320. Accordingly, the existing requirements of Part512 have been submitted to and approved by OMB pursuant to the PaperworkReduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These requirements have been approved through June 30,1989. Under this proposed revision these requirements remain collectionrequirements within the meaning published in 5 CFR Part 1320, and a requestfor continued approval is being submitted to OMB concurrently with thisnotice.The agency has also analyzed this action for the purpose of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act. The agency has determined that this action wouldnot have any effect on the human environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 512</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Confidential business information,Freedom of information, Motor vehicle safety, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.In accordance with the foregoing, NHTSA proposes the revision of Part 512of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 512_CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.1 Purpose and scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.2 Applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.3 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.4 Asserting a claim for confidential treatment of information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.5 Substantive standards for affording confidential treatment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.6 Determination of confidential treatment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.7 Petitions for reconsideration upon denial of a request for confidentialtreatment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.8 Modification of confidentiality determinations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.9 Release of confidential business information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">512.10 Class determinations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix A to Part 512_Certificate In Support of Request for Confidentiality</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix B to Part 512_Class Determinations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix C to Part 512_OMB Clearance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 49 U.S.C. 322; 5 U.S.C. 552; 15 U.S.C. 1401; 15 U.S.C.1402; 15 U.S.C. 1407; 15 U.S.C. 1418; 15 U.S.C. 1914; 15 U.S.C. 1944; 15U.S.C. 1990d; 15 U.S.C. 2005; 15 U.S.C. 2029; delegation of authority at49 CFR 1.50.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 512.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose and scope.</ITAG>The purpose of this part is to establish the procedure by which NHTSA willconsider claims that information submitted to the agency, or which theagency otherwise obtains, is confidential business information, as describedin 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 512.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability.</ITAG>(a) This part applies to all information which is submitted to NHTSA, orwhich NHTSA otherwise obtains, except as provided in paragraph (b) of thissection.(b) Information received as part of the procurement process is subjectto the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR, Chapter 1, as well as thispart.
