Lilley, who made the comments Saturday night in Seattle,apologized for the comment. He said protesters opposed to China'shuman rights policies provoked him by calling him an obscene name.   ``It was a mistake in the first place,'' Lilley said of theincident before he addressed Chinese and American delegates at theconclusion of a three-day Sino-U.S. trade conference. ``I shouldn'thave done it.''   Lilley, who left Seattle on Sunday for Tokyo, made the commentsin a brief interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.   ``The ambassador's spontaneous remark does not represent theconsidered views of the United States government, nor indeed ofAmbassador Lilley himself as he clearly articulated in his speechlater that day,'' Tutwiler said.   ``No one appreciates better than Ambassador Lilley the challengeof working for reform and human rights in China,'' she said.   She said Lilley would not be reprimanded.   Lilley got into Saturday night's argument with a handful ofdemonstrators when he arrived with Chinese Ambassador Zhu Quizhen.About 50 demonstrators waved signs and chanted slogans condemningthe attack on pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square andChina's 40-year occupation of Tibet.   Jim Berman, 32, whose wife is Tibetan, said he and a half-dozenothers left the main group on the chance the ambassadors might usea side entrance.   They chanted ``China - human rights!'', ``Tibet for Tibetans!'',and ``Remember Tiananmen Square!'' he said.   Zhu ignored the demonstrators and went inside, Berman said.   But Berman said, and a videotape corroborated, that Lilleysuddenly shouted, ``Were you at Tiananmen Square? I was there.''   ``You're a bunch of cowards,'' Lilley yelled, looking back at a35-year-old Tibetan whom he apparently mistook for a Chinese. ``Yougo back to China and serve China.''   China invaded Tibet in 1950, crushed an uprising in 1959 andintroduced repressive measures, including suppressing TibetanBuddhism.   The 63-year-old Lilley, who was born in China, was appointed tothe ambassadorship by President Bush. He is a former CIAintelligence officer and former ambassador to South Korea, and alsohas served U.S. missions in the Philippines, Taiwan, Cambodia,Laos, Thailand and Hong Kong.</TEXT></DOC>
