It is the first time since the Communist takeover in 1948 that Czechoslovakia has purchased planes manufactured in the West rather than in the Soviet Union.    The planes, equipped with General Electric Co. engines and 216 seats in two classes, will be used by the Czechoslovak airline CSA &quot;for transportation of cargo and passengers to North America, Canada, the Far East and possibly other destinations,&quot; CTK said. It said the two planes would be supplied in late 1990 and early 1991.    The move is a part of a plan to revamp Czechoslovakia's state airlines in order to attract more tourists. </TEXT></DOC>
