The seasonally adjusted increase in the Labor Department'sConsumer Price Index, which translated into an annual inflationrate of 4.9 percent, followed a brisk 0.5 percent rise in Octoberand relatively modest hikes from June through September.   The price spurt was slightly higher than many analysts had beenexpecting. The government blamed the rise on a jump in natural gasand electricity costs and an increase in prices at supermarketcheckout counters for beef, eggs, fresh vegetables and dairyproducts.   Through the first 11 months of this year, consumer prices haverisen at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, up only slightly from the4.4 percent price gains in both 1988 and 1987.   However, the year-to-date figure masks a roller-coaster ridethat saw prices rising at a 6.7 percent annual rate for the firstfive months of the year, moderating through the summer and thenreturning to about average for the past two months.   The November inflation number, a notch above the 0.3 percentrise anticipated by many analysts, dampened hopes in financialmarkets that the Federal Reserve Board would lower interest ratesthis week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.50 to2,696.03 in the first half hour of trading.   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said in a separate report thatAmericans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation,fell 0.7 percent last month following a 0.6 percent rise in October.   In another economic report, the Commerce Department said housingstarts fell 4.7 percent in November, reversing a 13 percent jump amonth earlier. New homes and apartments were built at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 1.36 million units last month, down from arevised 1.43 million units in October.   Leading the November advance in consumer inflation was a 0.6percent boost in food prices, the steepest since May. Dairyproducts jumped 1.7 percent, the third consecutive sharp increase.The price of fruits and vegetables soared 1.8 percent, the secondbig gain in a row.   Economists are attributing the dairy price hikes to last year'sdrought, which caused many farmers to slaughter milk cows.   Gasoline prices fell 2.1 percent in November following a 0.9percent rise in October. However, other forms of energy were moreexpensive. The index for natural gas and electricity rose 1.5percent, while fuel oil edged up 0.2 percent following a big 2.5percent gain a month earlier.   Overall, energy prices fell 0.1 percent last month. Pricesexcluding the volatile food and energy sectors, a measureconsidered a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures,were up 0.4 percent following a 0.5 percent gain in October.   The cost of medical care, which has been increasing at an 8.5percent rate over the past year, was up 0.8 percent in November, inline with previous increases.   Clothing costs edged up 0.1 percent in November, following twomonths of steep increases that coincided with the introduction offall lines.   In other areas, new-car prices rose 0.8 percent, tobacco wasdown 0.1 percent and entertainment costs climbed 0.2 percent.   Before taking into account normal seasonal changes, the ConsumerPrice Index stood at 125.9 in November. That meant that ahypothetical selection of goods and services costing $100 in the1982-84 base period would have cost $125.90 last month, up from$120.30 a year ago.   The Bush administration is predicting an improvement in consumerinflation next year to the 4.1 percent range, not far below theprojections of most economists.   However, private analysts generally don't share theadministration's optimistic belief that inflation will continue todecline in 1991 and beyond. They predict the Federal Reserve Board,which influences economic growth by its control of interest ratesand the money supply, won't engineer the sustained period ofsluggishness necessary to flatten wage increases.   Analysts attribute the most recent spate of dampened priceactivity in part to the central bank's year-long campaign, endedlast spring, of pushing interest rates higher. Since then, the Fedhas sought to avoid a recession by allowing rates to decline.   ``We don't think the Fed really has the strength of will toreach its zero inflation goal,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economistwith DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.   The 5.4 percent unemployment rate in November, she said, matchedthe rate at the start of the year and was not appreciably above the15-year low of 5 percent, reached in March.   ``Services are 55 percent of the (consumer index) ... and Idon't think there's been very much easing in the labor market,''she said. ``The pressure is still toward larger wage increases.''   Last week, the Labor Department said its index for wholesaleprices, which does not include services, declined by 0.1 percent inNovember.</TEXT></DOC>
