The plastic, a polymer called PHBV, has long attractedresearchers' attention but has been kept off the market byprohibitively high production costs. The marketing test isintended partly to learn whether demand will support theadditional production capacity that would help to bring costsdown.</LP><TEXT>   Wella AG, based in Darmstadt, will use bottles made ofPHBV to package one of its Sanara shampoos, starting nextmonth. Wella says Sanara is a minor line, but it uses naturalingredients.   &quot;It's a very good material,&quot; said Anthony Andrady, amaterials scientist at Research Triangle Institute whostudies PHBV and other biodegradable plastics undergovernment contracts. He said research indicates PHBVdegrades completely in soil and sea water, and itsperformance characteristics appear promising. &quot;But we need tofind a price range the market considers reasonable,&quot; he said.   In addition, PHBV -- like many other biodegradablematerials -- won't degrade quickly in the dry, oxygen-poorenvironment of the modern landfill. Thomas Galvin, a chemistwho manages ICI's biopolymers work, said ICI believes PHBV ina landfill will degrade faster than commodity plastics but nofaster than paper, which can require decades.   Noting recent outcries about overstated claims forbiodegradable materials, plus the capital required to scaleup production, Mr. Galvin said ICI intends to proceedcautiously. &quot;We're playing it cozy, because it's a biginvestment and because there is a lot of controversy outthere already.&quot;   Hans Karras, an executive at Wella's U.S. operations, saidWella is &quot;interested in evaluating all the possibilities inthe waste cycle.&quot; But for now, the company considers its useof PHBV a &quot;pilot project&quot; to accompany its efforts to favormaterials that can be recycled.   At ICI's pilot plant in Billingham, Britain, productioncosts run about $15 a pound. That compares with 30 cents orless a pound for such commodity plastics as polyethylene orpolypropylene. Mr. Galvin said ICI expects to cut productioncosts again, to about $7.50 a pound, when it expands theBillingham plant this year to an annual capacity of 300 tonsfrom 25 tons currently.   He said the next step is uncertain, but if ICI laterdecides to build a 10,000-ton plant, it may then be able toslash costs to the point that selling prices for PHBV wouldrange from $2 to $3 a pound. At that price, he surmised, PHBVmight be competitive for use in products where the plasticcontent represents a small part of the total production cost.   According to Mr. Galvin, ICI, a diversified chemicalsconcern based in London, has developed prototype equipment tomake items including bottles and table utensils. The toughesttechnique to perfect has been the making of plastic film,such as that used in disposable diapers.   The PHBV itself is made by gorging bacteria calledAlcaligenes eutrophus with glucose. After the bacteriaconvert the glucose to PHBV, which they store as an energyreserve, the bacterial cells are broken open and the PHBV isharvested. ICI says PHBV breaks down into water, carbondioxide and humus.   Mr. Galvin cautioned that even a 10,000-ton plant would besmall, producing by his estimate one-tenth the plastic neededto make a year's supply of disposable diapers in the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
