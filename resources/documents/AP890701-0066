Then there'sZaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko, who turned up here last week andreceived a red carpet welcome.   For the past generation, Mobutu has been a source of both prideand anguish to Washington. It is hard to find a leader anywhere morewilling to support Washington's policies than Mobutu, but he is aleader who tolerates virtually no dissent while presiding over whatis widely regarded as one of Africa's most corrupt societies.   Mobutu himself has accumulated vast personal wealth, taking theform of a number of castles and palaces in Europe and elsewhere andhuge foreign bank accounts. Some estimates of these accounts runinto the billions but Mobutu has put the figure at ``less than $50million.''   Randall Robinson, an Africa expert and liberal critic of Mobutu,derides Zaire as a ``kleptocracy.''   Successive administrations in Washington dating back to Mobutu'srise to power in 1965 have been willing to overlook Mobutu'sperceived shortcomings and focus instead on his unswervingwillingness to support U.S. strategic objectives.   At a time when so many Third World countries, regardless ofpolitical system, have shied away from supporting Washington'sforeign policy agenda, Mobutu is an exception.   He has allowed the U.S. military use of Zairean territory toresupply anti-communist guerrillas in Angola. He played a major rolein bringing about a cease-fire in Angola's civil war on June 22, agoal that had eluded the efforts of others for 14 years.   He has been an outspoken opponent of Libyan leader MoammarGadhafi. His representatives have lobbied hard against anti-Americanresolutions in the Organization of African Unity and other ThirdWorld groups.   A month ago, he helped the Bush administration fend off a bid bythe Palestine Liberation Organization to join the World HealthOrganization. When the United States decided to boycott the 1980Olympics in Moscow, Mobutu ordered Zaire's athletes to stay home aswell.   But then there is Mobutu's authoritarian side, which wasdescribed recently by Freedom House, a New York-based group whichattempts to promote democracy throughout the world.   In Zaire, the report said, ``presidential elections are farces.Private newspaper ownership remains only in name. Broadcasting isgovernment owned and directed. Censorship and self-censorship arepervasive. There is no right of assembly, and union organization iscontrolled. Government has been arbitrary and capricious. Thejudiciary is not independent; prisoners of conscience are numerous,and execution and torture common.''   In terms of human freedom, the report ranked Zaire at about thesame level as Vietnam which, like Zaire, is a one-party state.Corruption in Zaire, the study said, is ``pervasive.'' Many of thesame criticisms are contained in the annual State Department humanrights report.   None of the supposed drawbacks appears to have had much impact onU.S. aid programs in Zaire. Hundreds of millions of U.S. aid dollarshave been earmarked for Zaire under Mobutu's rule. The aid levelsrecently have been averaging a shade under $50 million, making Zaireone of the largest aid recipients in Africa.   When President Bush received Mobutu on Thursday, he skirted thehuman rights issue, concentrating instead in his public remarks onthe Zairean's diplomatic achievements and his staunch backing forAmerican policies.   During his visit, Mobutu dismissed questions about human rightsabuses, contending that he has the support of ``100 percent'' ofZaire's 34 million people. And for all the sympathy he has receivedfrom Washington over the years, Mobutu indicated in an appearanceFriday that his friendship has not always been reciprocated.   Seemingly more in sorrow than in anger, Mobutu said the Sudanreceived eight times more U.S. aid than Zaire several years agodespite staking out anti-U.S. positions.   ``We have been a steadfast friend,'' he said. ``I find this a bitconfusing.''</TEXT></DOC>
