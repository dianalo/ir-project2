Switzerland's highest court convicted Hussein Hariri on all sevencharges against him, including murder, attempted murder andhostage-taking.   The 22-year-old Hariri, who previously said a life sentence wouldbe ``no problem,'' rose from his chair but showed no emotion whenthe verdict was read. He will be eligible for parole in 15 years.   The ruling by the five-member Federal Criminal Court followed afour-day trial in which the prosecution called Hariri a ``killerblinded by conviction.''   Defense attorneys had sought a conviction on the lesser charge ofmanslaughter, claiming Hariri acted on reflex when he fatally shotXavier Beaulieu, 28. They said testimony did not disprove theircontention that the victim had made a threatening move.   Hariri was also ordered to pay damages of $556,000 to Air Afriqueand a total of $101,000 to Beaulieu's family, the flight attendentand a second passenger he threatened.   Hariri commandeered an Air Afrique DC-10 on a flight fromBrazzaville, Congo, to Paris on July 24, 1987, to press demands forthe release of Lebanese and Palestinians held by France, WestGermany and Israel.   After gaining control of the plane over northern Italy, hedemanded to be flown to Beirut but agreed to a refueling stop atGeneva airport. Hariri shot Beaulieu after his deadline for readyingthe plane expired.   Swiss police stormed the plane and arrested the lone hijackerafter crew members overpowered him and passengers began fleeing theaircraft over safety chutes.   Flight attendant Jean-Pierre Elouma was seriously injured by ashot from Hariri's pistol when he jumped the hijacker.   Investigators said Hariri boarded the plane at Bangui, CentralAfrican Republic, carrying 140 rounds of ammunition and 19 ounces ofexplosives.   Hariri refused to testify in court about his alleged links to thepro-Iranian Hezbollah group, Lebanon's most militant faction.   Presiding judge Jean-Jacques Leu said Hariri told pre-trialinterrogators that he joined Hezbollah in 1985 after his releasefrom an Israeli prison.   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for groups holding mostof the 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon, which include nine Americans.   The longest-held foreign hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   Hariri had told interrogators he received detailed instructionsfor his mission.   Swiss officials said his demands during negotiations at Genevaairport included the release of the Hamadi brothers, two Lebanesearrested in West Germany as terror suspects.   One of them, Mohammed Ali Hamadi, has been on trial in Frankfurtsince last July on charges linked to the 1985 hijack of a TWAairliner to Beirut in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.   Hariri told the court he did not intend to kill Beaulieu but thathe fired without aiming when the Frenchman, his head covered with ablanket, made a threatening move.   ``I did not want to kill anyone, I only wanted to liberate myfriends,'' said Hariri, who described himself as a ``soldier ofGod.''   But the flight steward told the court he saw Hariri kill Beaulieuwith a close-range shot to the head.   Hariri acknowledged he paid a bribe equivalent to about $6 toelude police controls at the airport in Bangui, where his fatherreportedly had a business.   He was expected to be returned to the maximum security wing ofGeneva's Champ-Dollon jail after sentencing.   The Hariri case gained wider dimensions with the kidnap of aSwiss Red Cross delegate in Lebanon last November.   Swiss foreign minister Rene Felber said the abduction was aimedgaining leniency for Hariri. The delegate of the all-SwissInternational Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Winkler, wasreleased after a month in the hands of captors who were neveridentified. Switzerland said no concessions were made.</TEXT></DOC>
