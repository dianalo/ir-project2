The militants, however, said they killed seven soldiers inThursday's attack at Nayaru village in Mullaitivu district, 170miles northeast of Colombo. Their statement did not give guerrillacasualties.   Military officials, who cannot be identified under briefingrules, said 10 more rebels were killed by Indian troops in separateskirmishes Thursday in Batticaloa in the east and Jaffna andVavuniya in the north.   Indian diplomats said they were not immediately aware of theclashes, which reportedly occurred a few hours before PresidentRanasinghe Premadasa asked India to halt military operations againstTamil rebels and withdraw its 45,000 troops.   The rebels, from the dominant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelamgroup, are holding peace talks with the Sri Lankan government toresolve their demands for a separate homeland. On Tuesday, the twosides declared a cease-fire in the six-year war that has claimed9,000 lives. But the rebels made no promises about attacks on Indiansoldiers.   New Delhi today repeated previous refusals to stop fighting untilthe insurgents surrender their arms.   An Indian Foreign Ministry statement said: ``The latestannouncement is meaningless unless it reflects the LiberationTigers' commitment to the unity and integrity of Sri Lanka, and tothe giving up of violence, not only against the Sri Lankangovernment, but also against fellow Tamils and other communities inthe Northeast Province.''   The deployment of the Indian troops is causing friction betweenColombo and New Delhi.   The troops arrived two years ago to disarm rebels under anIndian-sponsored accord. But soon the militants launched acounteroffensive in which at least 800 Indian soldiers and 1,500rebels have been killed.   Tamils want to set up an independent nation in the northeast,where most of them live and where they are a majority. They allegediscrimination in jobs and education by Sinhalese who comprise 75percent of the country's 16 million people. Most Sinhalese areBuddhists and Tamils are mainly Hindu.</TEXT></DOC>
