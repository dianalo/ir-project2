Sununu claimed for the Bush administration the achievement ofkeeping the economic recovery going, saying: ``This economy isstrong, it is robust, and it will continue to thrive as long as wedon't adopt policies to scrunch it down.''   ``Those policies,'' he added, ``include interest rates. Those ofyou who are wise consumers understand that when you go to buy a caror a house or anything that requires you as a consumer to pay overa long period of time, one of the most critical aspects of whetheror not it's a good deal for you is the rate of interest you willhave to pay on the purchase.''   President Bush has said that he does not want the FederalReserve Board, an independent body, to concentrate so hard onfighting inflation that it tips the economy into a recession.   The Fed has strong influence over interest rates through itscontrol of the money supply, largely exercised through purchasesand sales of government bonds, through rates it charges for use ofits funds, and through other regulations.   Fed credit policies are made public only with a time lag. Thepolicy-making Open Market Committee decided in February not toincrease rates further for the moment, but two weeks after thatmeeting the Fed raised by one-half percentage point to 7 percentthe rate it charges member banks for funds.   The most recent figures show the economy expanding at an annualrate of 3 percent during the first three months of the year, andinflation as measured by consumer prices increasing at an annualrate of 6.1 percent during the first quarter, the highest rate intwo years.   Sununu said the budget agreement with Congress would bring adeficit reduction of $65 billion to $75 billion, and economicgrowth if it continues at the current rate would add $85 billion ayear to federal revenue next year and the year after without newtaxes.   ``Compare that to what alternatives that are being proposed. Oneof the alternatives is a gasoline tax (increase),'' he said.   ``I think you all remember what happened when we had significantincreases in gasoline prices in the late '70s. Our economy wasstifled. ... If you want to match what you can get out of growthwith a gasoline tax that would inhibit growth, you would have to belooking at an 85-cent per gallon increase.   ``I can't imagine anyone advocating such a policy and gettingaway with being called a consumerist, and yet there are those whoare trying to do that.'' He did not say who he had in mind.   ``As a consumer you certainly worry about having competitiveproducts in the market, and it is a consumer issue to have a strongcommitment to free trade that allows competitive products to comein here,'' Sununu said.   ``And I think one of the most difficult consumer issues to dealwith emotionally is the trade issue. Because sometimes the firstreaction, the emotional reaction of exclusion, is not one in thebest interests of consumer or the country,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
