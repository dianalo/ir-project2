Lublin</HL><DATE>04/17/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE R4</SO><LP>   Congratulations. The Japanese-owned company down thestreet has offered you a big job at a big salary. It seemstoo good to be true.   It probably is.</LP><TEXT>   When you tally your total compensation package, you maydiscover that you would be better off at a U.S. firm. True,job security is probably greater with a foreign-owned firm,but there is a lot less reward for individual performance.And foreign firms show a great reluctance to give employeesany equity stake in the parent company.   In short, the better you are, the wider the pay gapbetween U.S. firms and foreign companies' U.S. subsidiaries.The gap can be enormous -- as much as 40% for some comparablehigh-level positions.   &quot;Europeans and Asians don't believe in the U.S. Pavloviantheory of compensation: the carrot and the stick,&quot; saysMichael Emig, a principal at Wyatt Co., acompensation-consulting firm.   Only 38% of foreign companies' U.S. affiliates offerpotentially lucrative incentives such as stock options,compared with nearly 90% of Fortune 500 companies, accordingto a recent survey by Hay Group. These foreign affiliatesalso are much stingier with annual bonuses. And they are lesslikely to offer executives often-coveted perquisites such ascountry-club memberships, company cars and executive diningrooms.   Now for the good news: Intense competition for seniorexecutives is beginning to force foreign owners to sweetenthe pot. In 1988, U.S. affiliates of foreign companiesemployed 3.8 million people -- more than twice as many asthey did in 1978. The total easily could double again by1993, consultants say.   &quot;The gap is too big to ignore,&quot; says Louis Brindisi,senior partner at Strategic Compensation Associates, aconsulting firm. &quot;People go where the big bucks are.&quot;   The biggest presssure comes in highly competitiveindustries like health care. Solvay America Inc.'spharmaceutical division &quot;certainly lost some&quot; hot prospectsbecause it didn't offer long-term incentives, says FrankMcKevitt, human-resources vice president at Solvay America,the Houston subsidiary of Belgium chemical giant Solvay andamp;Cie.   So this year, he is phasing in a deferred-bonus plan for20 of Solvay's 85 U.S. senior managers. He says the bonusmade &quot;compensation discussions a great deal easier&quot; infinding a new head of the automotive-plastics division. Thedeferred bonus also has curbed management turnover.   Yet it took Mr. McKevitt a full year, six trans-Atlantictrips and a lot of overhead slides before Solvay's top brassaccepted deferred bonuses. Mr. McKevitt recalls his bossesasking: &quot;We're a long-term company anyway -- why do we haveto pay {American executives} twice?&quot; He won over the Belgiansin part by arguing that Americans don't receive generousgovernment benefits that are common in Europe, such as freemedical care and college tuition.   Still, Europeans are eager to change compared with theJapanese. Nearly 75% of European concerns may offer long-termincentives to American executives within five years, comparedwith under 60% today, predicts Annette Rosinski, aninternational-compensation specialist for Hewitt Associates.Stock options are catching on in Europe, although generallywith narrower scope and scale than in the U.S.   In contrast, a Hewitt poll shows only a third ofJapanese-owned units now provide long-term inducements inAmerica. Ms. Rosinski believes the proportion will go nohigher than 50% in the next couple of years. &quot;Japan willalways lag behind,&quot; she says.   The reason, Ms. Rosinski says, is cultural. She cites theskepticism of officials at one Japanese toiletries maker whorepeatedly quizzed Ms. Rosinski when she suggested so-calledphantom stock for two U.S. businesses it had acquired.(Phantom stock usually involves payments reflectingappreciation in a company's shares or other performancemeasures.) &quot;Why do you {Americans} need long-termincentives?&quot; the puzzled Japanese asked. &quot;You are going to behere forever.&quot; Her reply: Many U.S. executives job hop, andneed financial motivation to think farther ahead than nextquarter's results.   Still, compensation pressures on Japanese companies in theU.S. are mounting as more Americans move into managementpositions -- and hit a glass ceiling blocking high-leveladvancement because they aren't Japanese. Americans'frustrations over the lack of upward mobility inJapanese-owned firms is seen in a flurry of job-bias suitsfiled recently against Japanese corporations.   The need for U.S.-style pay practices at Japan Inc. &quot;isjust something which is emerging now,&quot; says Dan Schaul, whojoined Sumitomo Trust andamp; Banking Co. in 1988 as one of just ahandful of American managers among Sumitomo Trust's 100 U.S.employees. Today, Sumitomo Trust has 250 employees in theU.S., including about 15 Americans, and Mr. Schaul has beentrying to Americanize the pay package at the trust company.   Mr. Schaul, now North American vice president for humanresources, concedes that his forays have been modest: Whilehe has introduced richer annual bonuses -- high-flyingtraders can earn about 30% of their salaries in bonuses,double the previous maximum -- Sumitomo Trust still doesn'tmatch the bonuses and stock options common at U.S. rivals. Hewas able to sell Tokyo on the idea of a retirement savingsplan after several senior staff members complained &quot;that theycouldn't rely on Social Security to take care of their fullretirement needs,&quot; Mr. Schaul says.   Similarly, John Rehfeld, president of Seiko InstrumentsUSA Inc., believes his position will give him the leverage tolaunch a long-term bonus program soon for his nine Americanofficers and division heads. &quot;It's the exception rather thanthe rule to have an American as the top operating officer&quot; ofa Japanese-owned business, notes Mr. Rehfeld, whose companyis based in Torrance, Calif. &quot;I can sort of push this thingthrough. It would be a lot harder if I was a Japanese guybecause {a long-term bonus} isn't something they understand.&quot;   Making it even harder these days is the U.S. recession.One U.S. subsidiary of a German auto maker is considering along-term compensation plan, but the subsidiary's chiefexecutive fears bringing it up with his bosses atheadquarters, which lacks such a plan. &quot;When you're not doingvery well in sales, you don't want another hassle back home,&quot;explains Alan Johnson, an executive-compensation specialistwith GKR International, a British-based executive-search andcompensation-consulting firm. &quot;It's hard to rationalize whyAmericans who produce less and are less productive should bepaid more,&quot; says Mr. Johnson, who is advising the U.S.subsidiary.   There is another compelling reason why foreign concernsresist going all-American in their compensation practices:fear of alienating employees back home, as well asnon-Americans who work in the U.S. office.   Yoshi Noguchi, a recruiter for Paul Ray andamp; Carre OrbanInternational in Los Angeles, mimics an expatriate's typicalprotest: &quot;What the heck is this? I work harder than you{Americans} do, and the company is favoring the American guy.I have been devoting my life to the company, and this is notfair.&quot;   Such jealousy isn't confined to the middle levels of thecompany. Consider one American executive, hired in 1980 for$90,000 a year to run the U.S. arm of a Japanese auto-partsmaker. The Japanese chairman griped about his subordinate'shigh pay, tried to take away the American's company car, andblocked attempts to extend company cars to other Americanexecutives in the company.   However modest, the U.S. executive's pay had made himextremely conspicuous: At the time, he was the company'shighest paid manager in the world.</TEXT></DOC>
