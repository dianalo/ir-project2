The joint marketing agreement also will allow the corporateneighbors to explore possible product links between Control Data'sCyber mainframes and Cray's supercomputers.   ``The objective is to offer a seamless network of computingpower, including supercomputers, mainframes, information servers,network servers and work stations,'' the two Twin Cities companiessaid in a news release.   Control Data closed its ETA supercomputer subsidiary April 17,saying it could not afford to continue funding the money-loser,which was competing with industry leader Cray.   How much money Control Data will receive for selling Cray'smachines is not known, said Thomas Charland, a Control Dataspokesman. He said there are no plans for Cray to take a stake inControl Data as part of the deal.   ``It's strictly a joint marketing arrangement,'' Charland said.   James Ousley, Control Data's Computer Products Group president,said the arrangement will help solve the ``future supercomputingrequirements'' of Control Data customers.   When ETA, based in St. Paul, Minn., was shut down, 3,100 peoplelost jobs. Control Data Chairman Robert Price has said thesupercomputer venture was too expensive. It ate up at least $238million over its approximately six-year lifespan when Control Datawas having trouble paying its short-term bank loans. The shutdownwill cost the company about $350 million and result in a hugeoperating loss for the second quarter in which additionalwrite-downs of $140 million will occur, Price said.   Meanwhile, the expense and risk of a supercomputer designproject by Cray founder Seymour Cray has been cited by analysts asone reason Cray announced Monday that it would split into twocompanies. Seymour Cray and his 200-member staff in ColoradoSprings, Colo., will form a new company in which Cray Research Inc.will hold a 10 percent stake, the company announced.   Seymour Cray's company will continue to develop the Cray-3,which he says will be the fastest supercomputer in the world. CrayResearch will concentrate on its bread-and-butter machines, theY-MP and its successors.   Ousley said Bloomington-based Control Data and Minneapolis-basedCray already have strong product ties in several areas. ControlData's Cyber work stations are compatible with Cray supercomputers;and Cray also uses disk products from Imprimis, a Control Datasubsidiary.</TEXT></DOC>
