A well-designed voltage comparator      will have high gain and low input offset voltage, with the result that      sensitive and accurate comparisons can be performed between the input      signals. However, it is equally important that the digital output level of      the comparator be compatible with the digital logic levels of the IC's      internal logic gates. </PAR><PAR>  Ideally the output signal of the voltage comparator will be at a level      exactly at the switching point of the internal digital logic when the two      inputs to the comparator are at the same voltage, i.e. with no input      differential voltage. When one of the differential inputs is raised or      lowered, the output of the comparator will respond by switching to a high      or low level, typically representative of a digital&quot;1&quot; or &quot;0&quot;,      respectively. If the level of the output voltage of the comparator is not      at the logic switching point when its inputs are at the same voltage, then      the output of the comparator will be a skewed version of the differential      input. In the presence of small differential input signals, the      comparator's output may not make transitions past the logic switching      point, and input data will be lost. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, for high sensitivity to input signals it is important not only      that the input voltage comparator have a low input offset voltage, but      also that the output level be centered around the digital logic switching      point. This can be difficult to achieve in the presence of supply voltage,      temperature, and process variations. All of these variations tend to alter      the comparator's output voltage level. </PAR><PAR>  There have been many attempts in the prior art to provide a voltage      comparator for responding to input signals for accurately driving      integrated circuit logic dates. Fang et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,371,843      teaches the use of feedback from one side of an input stage of a      differential amplifier to drive a single transistor current source. </PAR><PAR>  In a paper authored by L. E. Larson et al., entitled &quot;GaAs DIFFERENTIAL      AMPLIFIERS&quot;, appearing in the 1985 GaAs IC Symposium Technical Digest,      IEEE, pages 19 through 22, the use of level shifting circuits on both      sides of a ,differential amplifier is taught. Also, feedback from one side      of the input differential stage is used to drive a single transistor      current source. Harris U.S. Pat. No. 4,479,094 also teaches a use of a      level shifting circuit, but only on one side of a differential amplifier. </PAR><PAR>  In Pengue, U.S. Pat. No. 4,616,189 a differential amplifier is disclosed      that includes level shifting circuits for shifting voltages provided at      differential outputs of the amplifier down to GaAs compatible output      levels. Pengue also teaches the use of a differential current source with      common-mode feedback from the input differential pair. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  An object of the present invention is to provide an improved voltage      comparator for driving IC logic gates. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the invention is to provide a voltage comparator capable      of providing an output voltage having a level substantially equal to the      switching point of the digital logic gate being driven. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects of the invention are provided in a differential      comparator circuit including voltage level shifting means for shifting the      output of the left side of an included differential stage downward by a      predetermined voltage, by serving as a feedback voltage to drive a      differential current source controlling the magnitude of current flowing      through the differential amplifier. The other side of the differential      current source is driven by voltage reference means. The output stage of      the present voltage comparator includes output voltage level shifting      means, which in combination with the differential current source means,      voltage reference means, left side voltage level shifting means, and      matching of the transistors of the differential current source to those of      the logic gate being driven, insures that the level of the output voltage      from the comparator is substantially at the level of the logic switching      point for the logic gate being driven at times that the two voltage inputs      to the voltage comparator are at the same voltage or equal in voltage. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Various embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail      below with reference to the drawings, in which like items are identified      by the same reference designation, wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows a circuit schematic diagram of one embodiment of the      invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 2 and 3 show idealized and simplified partial circuit schematic      diagrams useful in illustrating the operation of particular embodiments of      the invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  With reference to FIG. 1, the embodiment shown is meant for using an      N-channel process to provide the voltage comparator in integrated circuit      form, preferably on the same substrate or chip as the logic gate being      driven. Accordingly, as illustrated, the comparator can be fabricated      using NMOS or N-channel MOSFET circuits, for example. However, as would be      known to one of ordinary skill in the art, the embodiment of the invention      of FIG. 1 can also be modified for using devices of the opposite      conductivity type, for fabricating the comparator using P-channel      processing. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 1, the illustrated embodiment of the invention includes      transistors Q.sub.5 and Q.sub.6 forming a standard differential pair or      amplifier 50, with Q.sub.7 and Q.sub.8 as depletion-mode load devices.      Transistors Q.sub.10 and Q.sub.12, and diodes D.sub.1 through D.sub.7 form      a left voltage level shifter 52 that shifts the output of the left side of      the differential stage 50 down by seven diode drops (the numbers of diodes      used in this circuit are chosen as examples). The shifted voltage is      applied as a feedback voltage to one side of the differential current      source 54 formed by Q.sub.1, Q.sub.2, Q.sub.9, and Q.sub.16. </PAR><PAR>  The differential current source 54, together with the voltage reference 56      formed by Q.sub.14 and diodes D.sub.8 through D.sub.11, and the output      voltage level shifter 58 formed by Q.sub.11, Q.sub.13, and Q.sub.15, and      diodes D.sub.12 through D.sub.14, ensures that the output voltage level      V.sub.OUT sits exactly at the logic switching point of the standard logic      gate 60 formed by Q.sub.3 and Q.sub.4 In general terms, the comparator's      output level is matched to the logic switching point because Q.sub.1 and      Q.sub.3 are matched to each other, i.e. either identical or differing only      by a width ratio, and Q.sub.2 and Q.sub.4 are matched to each other,      differing only by the same ratio as appears between Q.sub.1 and Q.sub.3.      As a result, an offset is introduced into the differential current source      54. In this manner, the output voltage of the present voltage comparator      is substantially matched to the input switching point of the digital logic      gate 60, regardless of typical voltage supply, temperature, and processing      variations. A more detailed description of this embodiment of the      invention follows below. </PAR><PAR>  With further reference to FIG. 1, the differential amplifier section 50      includes transistors Q.sub.5 and Q.sub.6 with their source electrodes      connected in common to the drain electrode of transistor Q.sub.1 and the      gate electrode of transistor Q.sub.16, the latter two being included in      the differential current source 54. The drain electrode of transistor      Q.sub.5 is connected to the common connection of the gate and source      electrodes of transistor Q.sub.7, and the gate electrode of transistor      Q.sub.10 of the left voltage level shifter 52. The drain electrode of      transistor Q.sub.6 is connected in common to the gate and source      electrodes of transistor Q.sub.8, and the gate electrode of transistor      Q.sub.11 of the output voltage level shifter 58. The drain electrodes of      transistors Q.sub.7, Q.sub.8, Q.sub.10, Q.sub.11, Q.sub.16, and Q.sub.4      (part of logic gate 60) are connected in common to the positive voltage      bus 62 for connection via terminal 64 to a source of operating voltage      andplus;V.sub.DD, typically andplus;5.0 volts DC. The gate electrode of transistor      Q.sub.5 is connected to an input terminal 66 for receiving a digital input      voltage V.sub.IN. The gate electrode of transistor Q.sub.6 is connected to      another voltage input terminal 68 for receiving NOT V.sub.IN. </PAR><PAR>  The left voltage level shifter 52 also includes transistor Q.sub.10 with      its source electrode connected to the anode of a diode D.sub.1. Diode      D.sub.1 is the lead or first diode of a series connected string of diodes      D.sub.1 through D.sub.7, respectively, with the last diode of the string      D.sub.7 having its cathode electrode connected in common to the drain      electrode of transistor Q.sub.12 and the gate electrodes of transistor      Q.sub.1 (part of differential current source 54) and transistor Q.sub.15      (part of output voltage level shifter 58). The gate and source electrodes      of transistor Q.sub.12 are connected in common to the common connection of      the gate and source electrodes of transistors Q.sub.9, Q.sub.14, and      Q.sub.13, respectively, and the negative voltage rail 70 for connection      via voltage terminal 72 to a source reference potential or negative      operating voltage -V.sub.SS, typically -5.0 volts DC. Note that      transistors Q.sub.9, Q.sub.13, and Q.sub.14, are included in the      differential current source 54, output voltage level shifter 58, and      voltage reference 56, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  The differential current source 54 also includes transistors Q.sub.1 and      Q.sub.2 having their source electrodes connected in common to the drain      electrode of transistor Q.sub.9. The drain electrode of transistor Q.sub.2      is connected to the source electrode of transistor Q.sub.16. </PAR><PAR>  The voltage reference 56 also includes a series connected string of diodes      D.sub.8 through D.sub.11, respectively, with the anode electrode of the      first diode D.sub.8 of the string being connected to a source of reference      potential, ground in this example. The last diode D.sub.11 of the string      has its cathode electrode connected in common to the gate electrode of      transistor Q.sub.2 (part of differential current source 54), and the drain      electrode of transistor Q.sub.14. </PAR><PAR>  The output voltage level shifter 58 further includes a series connected      string of diodes D.sub.12 through D.sub.14, respectively, with the first      diode of the string D.sub.12 having its anode electrode connected to the      source electrode of transistor Q.sub.11, and the last diode of the string      D.sub.14 having its cathode electrode connected in common to an output      voltage terminal 74, and the drain electrode of transistor Q.sub.15. The      source electrode of transistor Q.sub.15 is connected to the drain      electrode of transistor Q.sub.13. </PAR><PAR>  In this example, the logic gate 60 includes transistors Q.sub.3 and      Q.sub.4. Transistor Q.sub.4 has its gate and source electrodes connected      in common to the drain electrode of transistor Q.sub.3, and in this      example is a depletion mode NMOS transistor. Transistor Q.sub.3 also has      its gate electrode connected to output voltage terminal 74 for receiving      an input voltage from the voltage comparator, and a source electrode      connected to ground, in this example. In this example, transistor Q.sub.3      is an enhancement mode transistor. </PAR><PAR>  In the preferred embodiment of the invention, as shown, transistors      Q.sub.2, Q.sub.7, Q.sub.8, Q.sub.9, and Q.sub.12 through Q.sub.16, are      depletion mode transistors. Transistors Q.sub.1 is an enhancement mode      transistors. Transistors Q.sub.5, Q.sub.6, Q.sub.10, and Q.sub.11 can be      either enhancement mode or depletion mode transistor. </PAR><PAR>  Note that transistors Q.sub.7, Q.sub.8, Q.sub.9, Q.sub.12, Q.sub.13, and      Q.sub.14 each provide current sources with zero volts between their      commonly connected gate source electrodes, respectively. Transistors      Q.sub.15  and Q.sub.16 each are source followers, which in normal      operation have their respective source voltage substantially exactly      tracking their gate voltage, thereby causing the voltage drop between      their respective gate and source electrodes to be zero volts. </PAR><PAR>  Note further that the logic gate 60 is not part of the present invention,      but is included for purposes of illustrating that the comparator design is      dependent upon the design of the digital logic it is driving. Also, for      proper operation, transistors Q.sub.1 and Q.sub.2 of differential current      source 54 must mimic the operation of transistors Q.sub.3 and Q.sub.4,      respectively, of logic gate 60, in this example. </PAR><PAR>  Note also that transistors Q.sub.5, Q.sub.6, Q.sub.10, and Q.sub.11 are      shown as enhancement-mode transistors, and that such transistors generally      have a smaller &quot;knee voltage&quot; or saturation voltage relative to      depletion-mode transistors, and therefore would provide a larger output      voltage swing. However, although it is preferred that these transistors be      enhancement-mode for the reason given, the present comparator will operate      almost as well if these transistors are alternatively depletion-mode type. </PAR><PAR>  Also in the preferred embodiment, certain other transistors must be matched      for providing optimum operation of the present comparator. More      specifically, transistors Q.sub.5 and Q.sub.6 must be substantially      identical to minimize input offset. Transistors Q.sub.7 and Q.sub.8 must      be substantially identical to minimize input offset, and each of these      transistors must also be substantially matched to transistor Q.sub.9.      However, transistors Q.sub.7 and Q.sub.8 should have one-quarter the width      of transistor Q.sub.9, in order to insure that they draw the appropriate      magnitude of current. Transistor pairs Q.sub.10 /Q.sub.12 and Q.sub.11      /Q.sub.13 must be identically matched by having a fixed width ratio, to      avoid or minimize the output offset voltage. </PAR><PAR>  In order for Q.sub.15 to operate with zero volt between its gate and source      electrodes, it must be substantially identically matched to transistor      Q.sub.13. With the exception of having one-half the width of transistor      Q.sub.16, Q.sub.9 must be identically matched to Q.sub.16 to insure that      under balanced conditions in the differential current source 54, that      Q.sub.16 operates with zero volt between its gate and source electrodes.      Similarly, Q.sub.2 must be half the width of Q.sub.9, but otherwise      substantially identically matched thereto, to insure that under balanced      conditions in differential current source 54, Q.sub.2 is operating with      zero volt gate to source voltage in mimicking the operation of Q.sub.4 of      logic gate 60. The width ratios of transistors Q.sub.1 and Q.sub.2 must be      equal to the width ratios of transistors Q.sub.3 and Q.sub.4, with the      transistors of each pair being otherwise substantially identical to the      transistors of the other pair, for substantially insuring the correct      offset voltage level in the differential current source 54. </PAR><PAR>  Also in the preferred embodiment, the voltage drop across the string of      series connected diodes D.sub.1 through D.sub.7 must be substantially      equal to the sum of the voltage drops across the two series string of      diodes D.sub.8 through D.sub.11, and D.sub.12 through D.sub.14. Typically,      this is accomplished by matching the combination of transistor Q.sub.14      and diode string D.sub.8 through D.sub.11, apart from a fixed width ratio,      to the combination of transistor Q.sub.12 and any four of the seven diodes      of diode string D.sub.1 through D.sub.7. As a result, the remaining three      diodes of the diode string D.sub.1 through D.sub.7, together with      transistor Q.sub.12, must be identical apart from a fixed width ratio, to      the combination of transistor Q.sub.13 and its associated three diodes      D.sub.12 through D.sub.14. In other words, the current densities through      the diode strings D.sub.1 through D.sub.7, D.sub.8 through D.sub.11, and      D.sub.12 through D.sub.14, respectively, must be made equal in order to      insure matching of the voltage drops across them. </PAR><PAR>  In the preferred embodiment, as indicated above, it is important that      certain width relationships amongst the various transistors be maintained.      In summary, for purposes of illustrating this requirement in simplified      equations below, &quot;W&quot; designates width. These relationships are as follows      below in equations (1) through (6): </PAR><EQU>  WQ.sub.1 /WQ.sub.2 andequals;WQ.sub.3 /WQ.sub.4                     (1) </EQU><EQU>  WQ.sub.2 andequals;1/2 WQ.sub.9                                     (2) </EQU><EQU>  WQ.sub.10 /WQ.sub.12 andequals;WQ.sub.11 /WQ.sub.13                 (3) </EQU><EQU>  WQ.sub.15 andequals;WQ.sub.13                                       (4) </EQU><EQU>  WQ.sub.7 andequals;WQ.sub.8 andequals;1/4 WQ.sub.9 andequals;1/2 WQ.sub.16            (5) </EQU><EQU>  WQ.sub.5 andequals;WQ.sub.6                                         (6) </EQU><PAR>  It can be shown mathematically, that the present invention does provide a      voltage comparator having an output that is matched to the logic switching      level of a logic gate 60, in this example. The proof follows below. </PAR><PAR>  As a result of the widths of transistors Q.sub.5 and Q.sub.6 being equated      or matched, and of transistors Q.sub.7 and Q.sub.8 being equated or      matched, when input voltage V.sub.IN is equal to NOT V.sub.IN, the      magnitudes of current flowing through transistors Q.sub.7 and Q.sub.8 will      be equal, causing the voltages V.sub.D5 and V.sub.D6 to be equal. </PAR><PAR>  Transistor Q.sub.15 operates to equalize the voltages across transistors      Q.sub.12 and Q.sub.13, as a result of the voltage between the gate and      source electrodes of transistor Q.sub.15 being substantially zero volt. In      turn, this causes the magnitude of current flowing through transistor      Q.sub.12 (IQ.sub.12) to be equal to the magnitude of current flowing      through transistor Q.sub.13 (IQ.sub.13). </PAR><PAR>  As a result of the widths of transistors Q.sub.10 and Q.sub.12 being      equated, and of transistors Q.sub.11 and Q.sub.13 being equated, the      voltage V.sub.X (at the common connection of diodes D.sub.3 and D.sub.4)      is equal to the output voltage V.sub.O at terminal 74. Under the given      conditions that the input voltages V.sub.IN and NOT V.sub.IN are equal,      the output voltage V.sub.O can be determined by solving for V.sub.X, since      V.sub.X has been shown to be equal to V.sub.O. </PAR><PAR>  The combination of transistors Q.sub.1, Q.sub.2, Q.sub.5 -Q.sub.10,      Q.sub.12, and Q.sub.16 are idealized to be a gain stage 80, as shown in      FIG. 2.
