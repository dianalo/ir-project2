Hutton andamp; Co.   The jury in the town of Rapid City concluded that Huttonand a former Hutton broker took advantage of an inexperiencedinvestor, pursuing a risky investment strategy that cost theplaintiff $27,000. E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. is now part of ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc.</LP><TEXT>   In addition to the punitive damages, designed to punishthe defendant, the jury compensated rancher Wayne Stark forhis loss plus interest, amounting to $36,360.   The case began in December 1983, when Mr. Stark decided toinvest the proceeds from a cattle sale. The 45-year-oldcattleman from Belle Fourche, a town in the Black Hills,opened an account at a Hutton office in nearby Rapid City.   According to Mr. Stark's attorney, Ronald Clabaugh ofRapid City, Hutton used the money in a risky strategy knownas &quot;naked&quot; put writing. This meant that the broker, WilliamVan Drunen, sold options committing Mr. Stark to purchasevarious securities at a fixed price in the future. When themarket fell in October 1987, Mr. Stark lost $27,000.   According to Mr. Stark's 1989 lawsuit, Mr. Van Drunen wastrading in the rancher's account without his knowledge.Furthermore, according to the suit, the broker was &quot;churning&quot;the account -- generating excessive turnover in the accountto make money in commissions. Hutton, the suit claimed, hadfailed to supervise its broker adequately.   The trial began last week in Rapid City and lasted fivedays. The jurors, all from Rapid City, deliberated less thanfive hours to determine culpability.   Donald Walford, a Denver investment banker who testifiedas an expert witness for Mr. Stark, said, &quot;He had noknowledge of option trading. If you said stock to this guy,he said horses or cattle. He had no idea he could lose, andhe lost a lot.&quot;   Mr. Van Drunen, who was not named as a defendant in thecase, could not be located for comment. A Hutton attorney inChicago, Timothy Carey, said, &quot;We intend to file a motion tohave the verdict set aside.&quot;   ---   LOCKHEED faces wrongful-dismissal case filed by threecompany auditors.   In the case set to begin today, Lockheed Corp. is accusedof firing the auditors in 1985 for questioning the structuralintegrity of the giant C-5B military cargo plane. The C-5B isbeing used a lot in the Persian Gulf because of its 145-toncapacity.   The auditors say they were fired because they raisedconcerns about the C5B's metal mainframes, complaining allthe way up the chain of command to the then-president ofLockheed, Lawrence Kitchen. The defense contractor maintainsthat Thomas Benecke and Terrence Schielke were dismissedafter exhibiting &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; and circumventing&quot;company policies and audit procedures.&quot; The third employee,Clyde Jones Jr., &quot;had elected to retire well before&quot; Mr.Kitchen learned of the matter, Lockheed says.   The trial pits Lockheed against Herbert Hafif, an attorneyperhaps best known for suing ComputerLand Corp. over a$250,000 promisory note and ending up winning 20% of thecompany for his clients in a highly publicized jury award.Mr. Hafif said in an interview he aims to show how the C-5Bis &quot;a ticking time bomb,&quot; although he doesn't claim to beable to prove any specific accidents occurred because ofmainframe problems.   Lockheed says the company and the Air Force have studiedthe possibility of mainframe deficiencies over the years --including through task forces that the plaintiffs weremembers of -- and they've determined &quot;the parts had beenproperly prepared and are safe.&quot;   The case will focus in part on a letter the auditors sentin August 1985 to Mr. Kitchen, which ended: &quot;Our patience isexhausted. We will not be delayed or stonewalled for anyreason. This issue deals with life and death, and this letterrepresents our last resort in dealing with this probleminternally. The ball is in your court.&quot;   Mr. Kitchen threw the missive back across the table to Mr.Benecke. &quot;I told him I didn't like their approach,&quot; Mr.Kitchen said in a deposition. &quot;I asked why they had notfollowed the procedure of an audit report and taken itthrough the proper process; why they hadn't carried out theirresponsibilities that they had as auditors; and that I didn'tappreciate them coming in at the last hour.&quot;   Mr. Jones said later that he never &quot;dreamed that {Mr.Kitchen} would get in that state of anger.&quot; But Mr. Kitchen,who retired as Lockheed chairman in 1988 and is still adirector, described himself as perhaps &quot;forceful in myresponse, but nothing out of the ordinary.&quot;   ---   TOBACCO-LIABILITY verdict leaves both sides claimingvictory.   By finding American Tobacco Co. liable for the death of alongtime smoker -- but awarding no damages to his family -- ajury in Oxford, Miss., has muddied the waters of tobaccolitigation.   The family of Nathan H. Horton, a housing contractor whodied of lung cancer in 1987, charged American Tobacco withmarketing a &quot;defective and unreasonably dangerous product.&quot;The company, a unit of American Brands Inc., denied anyresponsibility for Mr. Horton's death. But anti-smokingforces saw Mississippi's state law, which is more favorableto plaintiffs than most other states, as working to theiradvantage.   A Lafayette County circuit court jury, by a 9-3 vote,found for the plaintiffs -- but went no further. Testimonyshowed that Mr. Horton &quot;continued to smoke in the face ofwarnings from his family and doctors,&quot; said David Roach, juryforeman, &quot;and therefore, he assumed some of the risk andfault.&quot;   Mike Davis, an attorney with Byrd, Davis andamp; Eisenberg inAustin, Texas, who helped represent the Hortons, termed theoutcome &quot;unusual,&quot; but said it represents progress in the&quot;evolutionary process&quot; of tobacco litigation. &quot;Five yearsago, a verdict for a plaintiff was unheard of. Now publicopinion is beginning to evolve to the point where {physicalharm} is a matter of shared responsibility.&quot;   Some tobacco industry analysts, however, seized on thesame point as evidence that cigarette makers scored a majorvictory. &quot;Even if you can prove&quot; that smoking causes harm,said Kurt Feuerman at Morgan Stanley, &quot;it's difficult toprove that the plaintiff wasn't aware of the risks. This{verdict} won't snowball into a tremendous number of newcases.&quot; American Tobacco declined to comment.   Immediately following the verdict, attorneys for AmericanBrands asked Judge Eugene Bogen to enter a judgment for thecompany, since no damages were due to the Hortons. Attorneysfor the Hortons, meanwhile, asked the judge to award at leastnominal damages or to set a new trial to determine damages.Judge Bogen said he would consider both sides' requests.   ---   SCHOOL FINANCING LAW declared invalid by Texas judge.   The law was adopted in June, eight months after the TexasSupreme Court said the state's system of financing publiceducation was unconstitutional because of disparities in thetreatment of rich and poor school districts. Like moststates, the Texas system relies on a combination of statefunding and local property taxes.   In response to the state supreme court ruling, Texaslawmakers approved a five-year education plan that adds $528million to state funding for public schools in 1990-91. But anumber of poorer school districts went back to court,contending the new law doesn't cure the inequities. InAustin, State District Judge F. Scott McCown agreed,concluding that the system &quot;remains unconstitutional.&quot;   Judge McCown said the state's lawmakers had failed toestablish a system that provides wealthy and poor schooldistricts with &quot;substantially equal&quot; access to revenue. Hedidn't order immediate changes, but told the Legislature tocome up with a better plan by next Sept. 1. If it doesn't,the judge said he would consider barring the spending ofstate and local funds earmarked for schools, or else tellingthem how to spend the funds.   W.N. Kirby, Texas commissioner of education, said he'llask the state to appeal the ruling, but he also urged theLegislature to work on a new plan &quot;or risk having the courtslead our children down the road of mediocrity for all.&quot;   ---   FORMER THRIFT REGULATOR joins Washington law office.   Rosemary Stewart, former director of enforcement for theOffice of Thrift Supervision, became a partner in the220-lawyer Washington office of Cleveland-based Jones, Day,Reavis andamp; Pogue.   Ms. Stewart resigned her post at OTS in August. Prior tothe creation of OTS in 1989, Ms. Stewart was enforcementchief at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. In that capacity,she received some criticism for her role in drafting a 1988memo of understanding with lawyers for Lincoln Savings andamp; LoanAssociation, a unit of American Continental Corp., Phoenix.   The memo, nicknamed &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; by thrift critics,cleared Lincoln for the pre-1986 period in exchange for apromise from Lincoln not to sue the bank board. But Ms.Stewart says that the memo resulted in a 1988 Bank Boardexamination that led to Lincoln being closed down. AmericanContinental Chairman Charles Keating Jr. unsuccessfullychallenged the Bank Board's actions in federal court. He isnow in jail awaiting trial on fraud charges brought byCalifornia.   Ms. Stewart said she will spend at least part of her timeworking on thrift matters at Jones Day. Although there is afederal prohibition against many former federal employeesrepresenting clients before their former agency in theirfirst year out of government, it doesn't apply to Ms.Stewart. She said she will begin representing clients beforeOTS immediately.   ---   Glenn Ruffenach and Wayne E. Green contributed to thisarticle.</TEXT></DOC>
