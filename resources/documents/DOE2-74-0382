<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0382 </DOCNO><TEXT>Hydrocarbon Research, Inc. (HRI) has completed the first one and one-halfyears of a two year study for the Department of Energy (DOE) under ContractNo. DE-AC-22-85PC80002 for the development of a ``Low Severity CatalyticLiquefaction Process'' based on the (CTSL) Catalytic Two-Stage Liquefactionof coal. Distinct elements of the two-stage process are a lower temperaturefirst stage and close coupling of two ebullated-bed reactor stages. Thisreport covers the Illinois No. 6 coal portion of the program includingexperimental microreactor, microautoclave, and continuous bench unitstudies from October 1985 through May 1987. The remaining portion ofthis contract was devoted to the study of Ohio coal. Results from continuousbench unit operations over a nineteen month period of studies on processvariables, recycle, catalysts, variable volume and thermal effects, cleanedcoals, and extinction recycle of heavy oils are analyzed, compared, andpresented along with conclusions and recommendations. In the IllinoisNo. 6 coal program for this contract there were 15 bench runs with atotal of 229 on-stream days with coal feed. A wide range of process variables,including temperature, residence time (coal space velocity), pressure,and recycle compositions were evaluated. Several catalysts with differentphysical and chemical properties were evaluated resulting in the selectionof a new commercial catalyst for the demonstration phase. Product characterizationstudies by HRI and other DOE contractors, which support this program,are included. In addition, work on process modelling, equipment improvementsand engineering analysis is included.</TEXT></DOC>
