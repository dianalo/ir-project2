This suggests that IL-1 administration may affect thecells in the bone marrow of normal mice. Intraperitoneal administrationof recombinant IL-1 resulted in bone marrow cell enlargement and increasedcycling of these enlarged cells. In addition, mice to proliferate inresponse to granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)in cell suspension cultures was enhanced. The authors have also previouslyshown that IL-1 induces the appearance of high titers of CSF in the serum.Consequently, hematopoietic growth factors that are generated at localsites following IL-1 administration may mediate the observed cell cyclingeffect.</TEXT></DOC>
