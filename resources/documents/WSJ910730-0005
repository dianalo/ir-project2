Mr. Melloan is entirely correct in asking,&quot;Should Americans allow Communists to say that seceding toescape slavery is the same as seceding to preserve it?&quot;   While the underlying cause of secession was slavery, theSouthern argument was based upon what were called states'rights. Each state, it was said, was sovereign, and possessedthe same constitutional right to withdraw from the Union thatit had originally to join it. Between 1787 and 1861 theconception of states' rights -- in the South, but not only inthe South -- had, however, undergone a strange sea change. In1787, as in 1776, all rights of the legitimate governmentswere held to be grounded in the equal natural rights withwhich every human individual had been endowed by his Creator.States' rights -- or states' sovereignty, according to JohnC. Calhoun, the spiritual father of the Confederacy -- had nobasis in natural law, but were entirely and exclusivelyrights of positive law.</LP><TEXT>   It was this severing of states' rights from natural rightsas much as the interest in slavery itself that drove themovement for secession in 1861. But the divorce of states'rights from natural rights not only removes any moral basisfor condemning slavery but places all constitutional rightsof individuals of every race or color at the mercy of thestate. It was not for nothing that the late RichardHofstadter called Calhoun &quot;the Marx of the master class.&quot;   Harry V. Jaffa   Senior Fellow   Claremont Institute   Montclair, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
