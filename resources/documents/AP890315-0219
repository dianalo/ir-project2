About 150 mourners, including a number of young women in furs andjewelry and men in expensive tailored suits, paid their respects ina flower-filled funeral chapel on the city's far West Side.   About 75 journalists, photographers, law agents and onlookersgathered across the street. Some waited more than an hour to get aglimpse of family and acquaintances of Ferriola, said by authoritiesto have started out in gambling and extortion, rising through theranks to become organized crime's chieftain in Chicago and itssuburbs.   Ferriola, 61, died Saturday in a Houston hospital reportedlyafter two heart-transplant operations.   ``When they put the casket in the hearse, I thought that he isreally just an ordinary person and I felt sorry for his family,''said Susan Trella, a resident of the nearby middle-classneighborhood, who added she came for ``the excitement.   ``I felt sorry for the family like I would for anybody else'sfamily,'' said Mrs. Trella, who'd bundled up her 3-year-old son,Anthony, for the wait. ``My husband says this isn't history, but itis.''   A rumor spread through the crowd that a yellow van parked acrossthe street was the mobile base for agents collecting videotapes andphotographs for organized-crime files.   Neighborhood resident Eileen Klein said she was on her way to doher grocery shopping when she noticed the television cameras. Shesaid she came to see if any of her favorite local TV reporters werethere.   As for Ferriola, ``I know he was in the syndicate, but I didn'tknow the man,'' she said.   Two men were comparing the number of out-of-state license platesthey'd counted. They declined to identify themselves.   ``The big boys ... the people who are supposed to take over(heading the crime operation in Chicago) didn't show up,'' one said.   ``This was a bustout,'' he said, ``and you can call me an`informed source.'''   The FBI and the Chicago Crime Commission, a privatecrime-watchdog group, said they'd have no comment on who attendedthe service.   Though the family requested that no flowers be sent, the funeralchapel was lined with mums, roses, bird-of-paradise blooms and otherexotic flowers _ at least 40 floral pieces _ arranged in the shapesof hearts, teardrops and crucifixes.   A Roman Catholic priest stood in front of Ferriola'srosary-draped casket to lead a simple 10-minute service.   He prayed that God would welcome Ferriola ``in mercy.''   He also spoke directly to Ferriola's five children, telling themthey should understand two things.   Their father had wanted to see them grow up, the priest said, andpeople don't ``get sick and die because of anything they do or youdo.''</TEXT></DOC>
