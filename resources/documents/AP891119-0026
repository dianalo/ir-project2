The paper, Al-Ingaz al-Watani, said el-Mahdi and the otherpolitical detainees left Kober prison Friday for their homes.   But Col. Suleiman Mohamed Suleiman, a member of the 15-manruling military junta that ousted el-Mahdi and his elected civiliangovernment in a coup June 30, was quoted by the Egyptian MiddleEast News Agency as denying the report.   He was quoted as saying el-Mahdi and other leaders would not befreed until they are cleared by a corruption investigation.   Following the coup, Sudan's military ruler, Lt. Col. Omar Hassanel-Bashir, disbanded all political parties and trade unions and puttheir leaders in prison. He has repeatedly accused them ofpolitical and economic corruption and vowed to put them on trial.Only a handful of them have been tried.   The government has said it was holding about 30 politicaldetainees, but informed sources said the figure was closer to 100.   News reports have claimed the government tortured el-Mahdi andthe others. London-based Amnesty International, which monitorshuman rights abuses, said el-Mahdi was abused and subjected to amock trial for failing to support the new government. The militarygovernment denied the allegations.   The newspaper said that besides el-Mahidi, the governmentreleased from prison Mohamed Osman el-Mirghani, leader of Sudan'ssecond largest political party, the centrist Democratic Unionist;and Hassan Turabi, the leader of the small but powerful Moslemfundamentalist National Islamic Front.   Noticeably absent from the list of those reportedly released wasMohamed Ibrahim Nugud, secretary-general of the Communist Party.   During the past month, the military government has beenreleasing small numbers of political detainees including formerCabinet ministers.   The newspaper said the releases were ``due to the politicalstability'' in the country since the coup.   El-Bashir has vowed never to allow Sudan's 36 political partiesto be formed again. He accused them of being the main reason forthe continuation of the nation's 6{-year-old civil war with rebelsand the deteriorating economy.   The rebels of this East African nation took up arms in 1983,demanding greater autonomy for the southern region of the country.
