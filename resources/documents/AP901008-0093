Press Trust and United News of India, both news agencies, saidfive students poisoned themselves and one set himself ablaze. Theincidents took place in the states of Haryana, Punjab and AndhraPradesh.   Students from higher castes, angered by a government refusal toreview the plan, attacked a passenger train in the central Indiancity of Allahabad, and set two train cars on fire. There were noreports of casualties.   In New Delhi, three students attempted suicide, Press Trustsaid.   Students from the city's schools, which opened Monday afternearly a month of forced closure, attacked buses and damaged30,the news agency said.   Monday's deaths brought to at least 90 the number of people whohave killed themselves or died in violence since Prime MinisterV.P. Singh announced Aug. 7 that nearly half of all government jobswould be reserved for lower-caste Hindus.   Public opposition to the government has been widespread in thepolitically influential cities of northern India. The army wascalled out and curfews clamped on several towns to control riotingstudents, joined sometimes by housewives and government employees.   Two members of Singh's governing party have resigned fromParliament and some colleagues have demanded his ouster because ofthe quotas.   But Singh has refused to abandon the policy, saying it is anaffirmative action program that would give social justice to thelower castes.   Critics say he fears alienating the lower castes, which form amajority of the eligible voters among India's 880 million people.   Upper-caste students say reverse discrimination will deprivethem of jobs for which they are better qualified.   The plan reserves 27 percent of federal jobs for low-casteHindus. An additional 22 percent already are set aside for thelowest strata in the rigid hierarchy of Indian society.</TEXT></DOC>
