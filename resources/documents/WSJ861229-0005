As you stated, my experience has been very positive. We have invested over three years of hard work and attendant resources to develop our operations in Cameroun. The expenses you referred to represent an estimate of only those costs associated with travel, salary, hotel accommodations, etc., for myself and my staff during our yearly visits.    Cameroun has an open-door trade policy. In March President Paul Biya visited the U.S. to finalize a trade agreement that protects U.S. investment and facilitates repatriation of profits. These are among many key features that encourage investment and, in my judgment, represent a move to expand beyond Cameroun's historical trading partners without relaxing its interest in continuing business with them.    Some readers may have concluded that Cameroun offered certain advantages to my firm because it is black-owned. On the contrary, I have found that Cameroun practices its open-door trade policy. This is the reason for our success. We have been given the opportunity to compete on projects within Cameroun and have developed our subsidiary to offer the highest-quality products and services at competitive prices. All our projects have been awarded through open competition.    Thomas A. Farrington   President   Input Output Computer Services Inc.   Waltham, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
