The 3{-hour rampage began when two unarmed guards ran intoresistance trying to confiscate homemade liquor from inmates, saidTim McNeese, executive assistant to state Department of Correctionsdirector Al Murphy.   The prisoners broke glass and burned mattresses and papersbefore surrendering.   The death was being investigated as an apparent homicide, saidMcNeese. He said the victim's name was being withheld pendingnotification of relatives. He refused to release details of how theman was killed.   After SWAT teams entered the building and inmates ended theirdisturbance without force, officers found the body during aninspection, McNeese said at a news conference.   ``It appears there was significant damage,'' said McNeese. Itwas mainly glass damage. ``There isn't that much in there toburn,'' he said.   Someone broke through a cinderblock cell wall to get at theinmate, he said. He said there was no immediate information whetherthe disturbance was staged to aid the slaying.   The cellblock involved normally has a population of 120. McNeesesaid he had no immediate indication how many inmates took part inthe disturbance and destruction, but many remained in their cells.</TEXT></DOC>
