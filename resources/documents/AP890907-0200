The four-day conference of 102 nations was attended by about 50heads of state and a dozen prime ministers. It was due to endThursday, but delays brought on by wrangling between hard-liners andmoderates kept the summit going until after 1 a.m. Friday.   The session passed a final declaration and adopted 30 politicaland economic resolutions dealing with topics ranging fromAfghanistan and the Middle East to terrorism and drugs trafficking.   Many of them were compromise resolutions, reflecting the deepdivisions among members.   The ``international terrorism'' resolution was agreed upon by themeeting's political committee after tough bargaining.   It said the heads of state and government ``resolutely demandedthat all hostages and all kidnapped persons be immediately released... irrespective of the perpetrators and the place of the crime.''   The resolution condemned all acts of terrorism perpetrated byindividuals, states or groups of states and expressed the movement'sdetermination to fight such acts ``with all possible legal means,both nationally and internationally.''   Yugoslav spokesman Goran Milic indicated in a meeting withreporters at midnight that the final session was delayed about 5{hours by disputes.   Pleas for pragmatism and cooperation with the industrializedworld contrasted with strident attacks on the United States. Severaldelegates denounced ``Zionism'' in their speeches, a topic thatcaused problems to the very end.   Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organizationinsisted that in addition to the final document's stressing the``struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racismand apartheid,'' it should also condemn ``Zionism and itspractices.''   Heated arguments with moderates followed, with Arafat drawingsupport from such hard-liners as Bangladesh, Yemen and Cuba. Acompromise was reached on including the ``Zionism'' reference in oneof the many political resolutions, sources told The AssociatedPress, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Nicaragua, in a bid to gain international prestige, sought to getthe summit to agree to hold its next summit there, but no agreementwas reached, conference sources said.   Delegates did agree, however, that Ghana would be the site for anon-aligned foreign ministers' conference to be held in 1991 inpreparation of the 10th non-aligned summit.   Moderates have emerged as the big majority and resistedthroughout the summit attempts by radical nations to introduce coldwar rhetoric.   Yugoslav President Janez Drnovsek told the closing session, ``Wehave achieved a high degree of unity about what the future of ourmovement should be.''</TEXT></DOC>
