A liberal believes that the state ought to be responsible for the welfare of a person. Thus a person ought not to be free to allocate his time, income and wealth. And he ought to be coerced by the state to serve the interests of others.    In this context, the economic policy makers of a government ought to treat a person as a member of a group and not as an individual. And they ought to prefer one person over another person, one group over another group. Thus government ought to change the economic situation of workers and employers. Government ought to control the effects of, and be responsible for, economic change. And economic decisions ought to be made by politicians, bureaucrats in government agencies, lawyers and judges. Similarly, unelected judges should make laws, as in an oligarchy. That is, power should be centralized in a few.    George Bush wants people to believe that he is a conservative. Is he? A conservative believes that a person ought to be responsible for his welfare. Thus he ought to be free to allocate his time, income and wealth. And he ought to be led by the &quot;invisible hand&quot; of markets to serve the interest of others.    In this context, the economic policy makers of a government ought to treat a person as an individual and not as a member of a group. And they ought not to prefer one individual over another individual, one group over another group. Thus workers and employers ought to adjust to their economic situation. Markets ought to be permitted to diffuse the effects of, and the responsibility for, economic change. And economic decisions ought to be made by buyers and sellers. Similarly, elected legislators ought to make laws, as in a democracy. That is, power ought to be decentralized in many.    Thomas E.
