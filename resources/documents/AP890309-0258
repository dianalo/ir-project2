For example, one of every eight people working in manufacturingis in an export-related job, the Bureau found.   The analysis of employment in 1986 showed an increase of 163,400export-related jobs from the year before.   Manufacturing accounted for the bulk of the export-related jobs,2,318,200 in 1986, the most recent year for which figures areavailable, the report said.   In addition, exports accounted for 994,500 jobs in trade, 298,400in transportation, 247,900 in business services and 717,600 jobs insuch areas as mining and agriculture, the Census Bureau reported.   On a national basis, exports accounted for 12.6 percent of allmanufacturing jobs, the report said.   Alaska leads the pack with fully 40 percent of its manufacturingjobs being export related. Alaska has a relatively small total ofmanufacturing workers, so that 40 percent amounts to only 3,600 jobs.   California has the most export-related manufacturing jobs at289,600. That's 14.7 percent of the Golden State's workers inmanufacturing industries.   Nationally, electronic equipment accounted for the largest numberof export-related jobs at 459,600, according to the new analysis.   The next largest category was machinery other than electricalequipment, providing 378,300 jobs for Americans.   Making transportation equipment for export provided 224,000 jobs.Next was fabricated metal products at 188,400 jobs, followed by182,000 administrative and auxiliary jobs, primary metal industriesoffering 159,500 positions, and 130,400 workers making chemicals andrelated products.
