Many banks world-wide have discovered that it isn't easy making a profit in retail markets abroad. Domestic banks often have greater market penetration, and so can provide customers with routine services at more convenient locations. This is particularly true in Thailand, where foreign banks have limited access.    In October, Chase Manhattan Bank told its customers in Thailand that it was discontinuing individual-account services. Clients were given six weeks to move their money elsewhere. Last year, Bank of America's branch in Thailand raised its minimum balance for free checking services to 100,000 baht ($3,970), and started requiring an initial 100,000-baht deposit to open a savings account. As expected, most of the bank's small-account holders left.    &quot;Mass-market retail banking is high-volume, low-margin kind of business,&quot; says Mike Marino, formerly Chase's consumer-banking manager, who returned to New York earlier this month. &quot;For some products, we just can't generate enough volume in Thailand to make them pay.&quot;    Bank of Thailand, the central bank, has long rejected requests from foreign banks to open new branches. Consequently, four of the 14 foreign banks in Thailand each have only two branches, while the remainder are each limited to a single office. By comparison, the smallest of Thailand's 15 domestic banks, Laem Thong Bank, has nine branches. The largest, Bangkok Bank, has 331.    The domestic banks have increased their advantage by setting up two automated-teller-machine pools. These pools allow the holder of an ATM card from one bank to withdraw money from the ATM of any bank in the pool. Foreign banks haven't been allowed to join the ATM networks.    A prominent exception to the foreign banks' drift away from mass-market retail services is Citicorp. Its Citibank unit aims to overcome the drawbacks of a single branch by attracting retail customers with products such as home and car loans, as well as credit cards provided by its Diners Club subsidiary. </TEXT></DOC>
