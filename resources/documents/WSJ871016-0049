Higher interest rates mean takeovers would be harder to finance, and many traders worry that a boost in rates will dampen takeover interest and abort announced deals. Concern has also been fueled by disarray in the market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. The proposed tax bill would repeal many tax breaks related to mergers and acquisitions and could halt highly leveraged takeovers.    So far these fears largely have hurt arbitragers, whose profits are tied directly to the fortunes of takeover stocks. Stocks of a number of widely speculated takeover plays, and even some announced deals, have been hammered this week, suffering dives even worse than the overall market's decline. They include the shares of Gillette Co., Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., Tenneco Inc., Allegis Corp., Dayton Hudson Corp. and USG Corp.    &quot;Hold on a minute, I'm getting in off the ledge,&quot; said one takeover trader yesterday. Added another, &quot;The arb stocks are getting destroyed.&quot; Some smaller arbitrage firms are said to have been hit by margin calls, causing them to dump stocks.    But while arbitragers have been hit hard, some takeover professionals say they aren't panicking yet. &quot;Plainly we're concerned,&quot; said an investment banker involved in a multibillion dollar takeover. &quot;You can't ignore what interest rates have done since August, but it's too soon to panic.&quot;    J. Tomilson Hill, co-director of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., likened the current market jitters to those that followed last November's disclosure of insider-trading charges against the arbitrager Ivan Boesky. &quot;Merger and acquisition activity, based on the high yield market, has hit periods of indigestion, and this is clearly one of them,&quot; he said. &quot;But as long as credit remains widely available to do deals, you can be fairly sanguine that this is just a hiccup.&quot;    As a result, Mr. Hill said the latest worries over interest rates aren't yet having a major effect on the way his firm does takeovers. &quot;It hasn't caused us to pull in our horns,&quot; he said. &quot;But people are being cautious.&quot;    Several Wall Street tax specialists said pending takeovers are being slowed or postponed out of concern both over interest rates and the tax bill under consideration by a congressional committee, even though President Reagan is likely to veto any such measure. Until several aspects of the bill are changed or clarified, these lawyers said, it would be unwise to go forward with several types of transactions, such as leveraged buy-outs or leveraged recapitalizations.    &quot;It's had a considerable chilling effect,&quot; said Peter Canellos of Wachtell Lipton Rosen andamp; Katz. &quot;If you're about to close a transaction, you have to think twice.&quot; He said two or three deals he is working on have been affected.    James Levitan of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher andamp; Flom, another firm active in mergers and acquisitions, said, &quot;We have a couple of transactions that are slowed up.&quot;    A Washington-based mergers specialist said that three deals he is involved with have been put on hold for at least a day or two by uncertainty about the tax bill. &quot;It's a profoundly important development for the world of acquisitions,&quot; he said. &quot;Its impact is extraordinary -- I mean, unparalleled.&quot;    In the meantime, Wall Street is awash with speculation that several deals may be canceled. &quot;We hear people are pulling away from doing bridge loans,&quot; said a strategist for one corporate raider, adding, &quot;If interest rates rise much more, you'll see deals come to a screeching halt.&quot; In bridge loans, a firm supplies critical interim financing for a takeover.    Two proposed deals frequently rumored to be at risk are Tonka Corp.'s $628 million takeover of Kenner Parker Toys Inc. and Samuel Heyman's $2.3 billion leveraged buy-out offer for GAF Corp. Both deals are to be financed with junk bonds, and issuers of those bonds are said to be growing worried that rising rates might hail a raft of defaults.    Tonka last week extended its tender offer for Kenner Parker, citing a need for &quot;additional time for finalization of financing.&quot; Sources close to that deal insist the delay was needed merely to complete paper work. Meanwhile, sources close to GAF's board said earlier this week that directors had rebuffed Mr. Heyman's offer as inadequate, and the GAF chairman was reported to be arguing that, with interest rates rising, a higher bid would be too costly.    ---               How Some Takeover Stocks Were Hit    Yesterday's trading                                    Close         Change    Allegis                         97            -5 1/4    Dayton Hudson                   49 1/2        -3 3/8    Gillette                        36 5/8        -3 7/8    Kansas City Southern            61 3/4        -6 1/8    Mead                            41 1/2        -1 3/4    Santa Fe Southern               56 1/4        -4 3/4    Tenneco                         57 1/2        -2 5/8    USG                             49 1/8        -3 5/8    Zayre                           28 3/8        -1 5/8</TEXT></DOC>
