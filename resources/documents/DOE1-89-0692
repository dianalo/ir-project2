Thispaper deals with the real-time scheduling of power transformers in adistribution substation, with loss minimization. A functional specificationof the function is presented, as well as its possible interaction withother functions normally encountered in a substation controller. In orderto introduce rigour and ensure a high level of security in the descriptionof the interconnections among the whole set of cooperative and concurrentautomata, a formal specification tool with computer aided validationcapabilities is proposed, the interpreted Petri nets. An economic evaluationwas performed using the discounted cash-flow method, based upon the realsubstation load diagrams.</TEXT></DOC>
