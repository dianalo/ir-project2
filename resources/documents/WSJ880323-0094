They are owners of partnerships and &quot;S&quot; and personal-service corporations who are waiting for the IRS to specify rules for keeping the firms on fiscal years. The IRS has delayed the date for filing both the firms' 1987 returns and the optional fiscal-year election. The deadline now is 60 days after the IRS issues the rules, to allow time to decide on the option. But by April 15, owners must file personal returns -- or extension requests -- and pay at least 90% of their 1987 taxes to avoid a penalty.    Yet an owner won't know by then which 1987 year-end his firm will use -- or, as a result, how much of its calendar-1987 income passes into his 1987 income. If a firm moves to the calendar year from a fiscal year, its owners' personal income will include firm income for both fiscal 1987 and a short transition period ended Dec. 31. The problem extends to estimated 1988 taxes due April 15 and based on 1987 taxes, notes the American Institute of CPAs.    In such cases, the IRS says, it probably would waive penalties for underpayments of tax.    REQUIRED-PAYOUT RULES have been eased for IRAs and teachers' annuities.    People who turned 70 1/2 in 1987 must take minimum payments from their individual retirement accounts by April 1. If you have multiple IRAs, the IRS said in 1987, you must withdraw the minimum from each. But Notice 88-38 now says that after figuring the withdrawal amount for each account, you may take the total minimum from any one or more of them. The rule applies at least through 1988. It also covers payouts to inheritors of IRAs.    The IRS says this withdrawal method also applies to annuities under tax-code section 403(b) for teachers and other employees of tax-exempt entities. (Annuity payouts can't meet IRA requirements and vice versa). Separately, Notice 88-39 delays until Dec. 31 from April 1 the starting date for minimum distributions from section 403(b) accounts. The payout requirement for these accounts was added by the 1986 tax act.    THE GHOST of Congress's indecision on benefits haunts the Tax Court.    While vacillating over how to tax fringe benefits from late 1977 through 1983, Congress imposed a &quot;moratorium&quot; on IRS efforts to broaden such taxation. Now the Tax Court has split over the effects on the court and a case. New York University Law School paid $8,250 to two other schools in 1979 as tuition for children of Prof. Charles L. Knapp under a faculty-aid plan. He treated the payments as tax-free scholarships. But the IRS wanted to tax them as pay to him; the court's ruling now upholds the IRS.    Judge Parr ruled and the full court agreed that the payments didn't qualify as scholarships. But the 18 judges divided over Knapp's claim that the IRS had changed its pre-moratorium position in seeking to tax such payments and so had broken the moratorium. Parr, writing for the majority, said the court lacks jurisdiction to enforce the moratorium and needn't consider it. But five dissenters saw no jurisdictional bar.    Four dissenters found the IRS violated the moratorium and voted to exempt the payments from tax.    &quot;S&quot; CORPORATIONS, which are taxed like partnerships, have been further popularized by tax revision. The IRS expects to get 801,700 S returns for 1987, up from 769,100 for 1986 and 564,219 for 1982. For 1992, it foresees 1,013,900 S returns -- 22% of the corporate-return total.    LAWYER, HEAL THYSELF: William V. McPherson Jr. cannot recover fees for time lost in winning his own case against the IRS, for he paid no fees, says the fourth-circuit appeals court. It reversed an order by a federal judge in Greensboro, N.C., who told the IRS to pay McPherson $8,802.    AND NO OVERTIME: It takes a household an average of 21.7 hours to do federal and state returns, says a University of Michigan economist. The cost, Joel B. Slemrod adds, averages $231 in personal time plus $44 in fees for professional aid.    NURTURE A NUTHATCH by cutting the grass? That's a conservation tax idea.    In 1980 Congress created a program to conserve fish and wildlife not taken for sport, fur or food. But legislators never funded the program. In an analysis for a Senate subcommittee, the General Accounting Office explored using funds from excise taxes on fuel for home equipment such as garden tractors, lawn mowers and chain saws. Money would be withdrawn from the Highway Trust Fund, whose overseers find the idea as welcome as a polecat.    Naturally, no one knows how much fuel is used this way. From trade-group data, the GAO estimates annual consumption at 248 million to 563 millon gallons and taxes at $21.3 million to $48.3 million (the highway fund got $8.95 billion in 1986). To move money from the highway fund to the Aquatic Resources Trust, the Treasury now must estimate motorboat-fuel usage; it doesn't want to have to do this for lawn mowers.    Selling &quot;semipostal stamps&quot; with a surcharge might raise $12 million a year for the program, the GAO says.    BRIEFS: A New York State Bar Association proposal to simplify laws in the next century urges that one combined return be created for federal, state, and local income taxes. . . . Rep. DioGuardi (R., N.Y.) seeks to have the IRS include in tax-form mailings an itemized statement of the average taxpayer's share of the national debt. </TEXT></DOC>
