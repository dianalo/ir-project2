However, such action isn't likely to prevent a determinedcomputer hacker from wreaking havoc again, said Eugene H. Spafford,an assistant professor and computer scientist at Purdue, said byphone from the campus in West Lafayette.   ``The worry of the National Computer Security Center, and ourworry, is that if somebody gets even a significant portion of thesource code, then they could turn out something more dangerous,''Spafford said.   Since hundreds of copies of the errant program already are out,Spafford believes trying to control the information ``is a losingbattle.''   Last Thursday, the ``worm'' program rapidly duplicated itself incomputer systems nationwide, spreading like a virus, slowing thecomputers' processing speeds and filling up their memories.   At Purdue, the worm entered a computer connected to Internet, aninternational computer network on which researchers fromuniversities, computer companies and some government installationsshare information and resources.   Officials from the National Computer Security Center, a divisionof the National Security Agency, contacted Purdue this week andasked that worm data be removed from a file where others could haveaccess to it.   The Purdue file had ``copies of the worm program and somewhatdisassembled, somewhat reverse-compiled versions of the code,''Spafford said. ``This could be used to understand how it worked, butit wasn't in a form that could be used to contruct a new version.''   He said the university did not consider the data potentiallyharmful, but removed it ``in an attempt to be cooperative.''   However, people who run the thousands of computers affected bythe virus believe they ``need to see the code so they can feelcomfortable that no damage was actually done ... so they can be surethey plugged all the holes that could be exploited. That's also avalid viewpoint,'' Spafford said.   ``One approach (to resolving the problem) might be to widelypublicize the fixes, without distributing the code; then, after areasonably short period of time, say three to six months, releasethe code,'' he said, explaining that the process would give peopleplenty of time to construct defenses against the program.</TEXT></DOC>
