(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan has no intention oftaking action to stop the trial of former aide Oliver M. North oncharges related to the Iran-Contra affair, a White House spokesmansaid Tuesday.   One day after U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said that Reaganhas the constitutional authority to stop the trial, likely to beginin late January, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that ``wedon't have any direct role'' in the case.   North has been indicted on charges of conspiring with others todefraud the government in connection with a behind-the-scenesattempt to use proceeds from the sale of U.S. arms to Iran to assistthe rebels fighting the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.   ``I still think Ollie North is a hero,'' Reagan said at one pointlast March, while predicting that North and former national securityadviser John M. Poindexter would be acquitted of the charges broughtagainst them.   But more recently, Reagan and top White House aides have refusedto discuss whether the president might grant a pardon to North. Withless than 60 days remaining in Reagan's term, such a move would seemimpossible in light of the president's determination to see thetrial proceed.   Reagan, when asked Monday whether he was nearing a decision on aNorth pardon, replied, ``No, no. And I don't think it would be anytime to make such a decision while it's still before the courts.''   Earlier Monday, Fitzwater had told reporters aboard Air Force Oneon the trip to California, ``I maintain that no one knows what thepresident's thinking on this is.''   But when asked about this again Tuesday, the spokesman repliedtersely, ``We aren't discussing pardons.''   Judge Gesell had noted that if the trial proceeded, it couldresult in the public release of a wide array of sensitive orclassified government information. The judge said he felt Reaganshould decide whether he wants to withhold certain documents likelyto be used either by the prosecution or the defense in the case.   Asked whether Reagan felt he had any role in notifying the courtof his views about evidence that might be used in court, Fitzwatersaid, ``We don't have any direct role, no.''   ``Our role at the moment is to work the courts ... in reviewingthe classified information,'' he said. ``As Judge Gesell pointed out... President Reagan called for this investigation in the beginning.... We have said yesterday, and on previous occasions, that thepresident's position on pardons was that he believes the legalprocess should be allowed to take its course _ and we are notdiscussing pardons.''   Fitzwater said that the White House, in fact, had been working``to review classified information that has been designated by theprosecution and by the defense. And we have declassified _ orreviewed and declined to declassify _ thousands of pages ofdocuments that have been provided by both sides in the case. And wewill continue to do that.''   Fitzwater said he understood that the judge was merely remindingReagan of his constitutional authority to thwart the trial if hewished to do so, but said ``that is not the president's intention.''   The spokesman also said that ``we have not asked for executiveprivilege (to protect secrets) at any point in this case. It has notbeen an issue.''   ``The problem is now on the defense side, where the defense hasintroduced thousands of new documents that they believe are germaneto the case, that would have to be reviewed as well,'' the spokesmansaid.</TEXT></DOC>
