Brothers Realty Limited Partnership,landlord of the Manhattan Bloomingdale's store, to permit itto pursue an action to terminate that store's lease.   Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. threw out that request, rulingthat, for procedural reasons, B. Brothers' actions violatedthe Bankruptcy Code. The judge called B. Brothers' actions&quot;vexatious,&quot; according to two lawyers at the hearing, andassessed sanctions against the landlord, which wasrepresented by the New York law firm of Pryor, Cashman,Sherman andamp; Flynn.</LP><TEXT>   At the hearing, Judge Aug also extended the period duringwhich Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied StoresCorp. have the exclusive right to file a reorganization planfor the two Campeau Corp. retail units. Judge Aug gaveFederated and Allied until Sept. 12 to file their plan. Thecompany's creditors hadn't objected to the extension.   In bankruptcy cases, the debtor has a right to file itsown reorganization plan before creditors have a chance tosuggest an alternative. But the debtor must file within adesignated period or lose that right.   In court documents, B. Brothers charged that Federated hadbreached its lease by improperly transferring its interest inthe store lease to a unit, Bloomingdale's Inc. B. Brothersalso argued that Federated had violated its rights bypledging the lease as security for new financing afterFederated filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Jan. 15.   David Heiman, counsel to Federated, said B. Brothers'arguments are &quot;based on a distinction without a difference.&quot;No rent payments have been missed.   In assessing sanctions, the judge said he would require B.Brothers to pay the legal fees incurred by Federated in thismatter.   After the hearing, Frederick Danziger, a lawyerrepresenting B. Brothers, said, &quot;We find what happenedextraordinary. We obviously just want to review thetranscript before commenting further. {We} view the judge'saction as very surprising.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
