The remains were believed to be those of two 11-year-old girlsmissing in the 23-hour siege that ended Wednesday the South Islandseaside hamlet of Aramoana.   Discovery of the two bodies raised to 13 the number of peopleslain by 33-year-old David Gray before police killed him in ashootout. Two children were wounded by Gray, who wiped out nearlyhalf of Aramoana's population.   Gray began his killing spree Tuesday night by setting aneighbor's house on fire, then opening fire on people who arrivedto try to extinguish the blaze. The motive for his actions remainsunclear.   Police kept the town cordoned off today except for forensicexperts, government officials and journalists.   Gray, who holed up in his home before fleeing to a house on theedge of town, used high-powered rifles to shoot neighbors and keeppolice from reaching victims scattered on the lawn of his house anda nearby street.   Detective Chief Inspector Peter Robinson told a news conferencetoday that after police riddled with tear gas and shot the house towhich Gray had fled, he emerged shouting ``Kill me, Kill me'' andfiring a rifle from his hip.   Fatally wounded, the gunman remained ``very active'' andcriticized police for not finishing him off. ``He was quitepossessed,'' Robinson said. ``He was extremely strong and veryhyped up.''   The village lies on a point in an area of steep hillsides andsandy marsh about 20 miles north of Dunedin on the island'ssoutheastern coast.   It comprises just five streets and was home to about 25 peoplebefore the massacre. Most of the houses are vacation homes, notfully occupied this time of year.   Among those killed were a couple and one of their two children,with their 4-year-old son hospitalized with a stomach wound. Theywere visiting for the day to work on their boat, according to thecouple's nephew.   A man who lived in the house Gray torched also was shot dead,and his daughter and a friend's daughter, both 11, were missing andpresumed dead in the fire. The man's 9-year-old daughter wasrecovering from a gunshot wound.   A psychiatrist and four parents helped console children at the143-student primary school in nearby Port Chester, where thestudents included two 6-year-olds who were killed and the twomissing girls.   The unemployed Gray, who had an obsession with guns, wasreported upset over the recent death of his mother. Some neighborsalso pointed to a long-simmering dispute between Gray and thevictim whose house he burned.</TEXT></DOC>
