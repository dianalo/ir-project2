The Journal is atwitter that I, together with virtually the entire Armed Services Committee, refused to authorize $500 million to build a new NATO base in Italy rather than forcing our allies to shoulder more of the cost.    Had the Journal sent a reporter to the committee markup, rather than an editorialist masquerading as a reporter, your readers might have learned that the amendment was offered by a Republican and was adopted without opposition. Your readers also might have learned that the amendment would save the American taxpayers upward of $250 million.    Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.)    Washington    ---   Contrary to your assertions, the House Armed Services Committee restoration of the V-22 Osprey program was an act of responsibility to American taxpayers.    Based on the advice of Pentagon budget crunchers, Secretary Richard Cheney recommended the elimination of the V-22 program and proposed that we fulfill the mission of that aircraft with existing helicopters. While the alternatives cost less than the V-22 this year, they represent savings only to the shortsighted. Ultimately, the American public will pay up to $8.5 billion more for an inferior fleet of antiquated aircraft.    Unfortunately, the deceptive numbers game that Pentagon pencil pushers are playing with the V-22 program may be the least cause for concern. More sobering is the fact that the proposed V-22 alternatives are militarily inadequate.    Given a defined military need and the choice between the revolutionary V-22 aircraft and the costly, risky alternatives to meet it, the Armed Services Committee had a responsibility to restore funding for the Osprey.    Rep. Curt Weldon. (R., Pa.)    Washington    ---   It is poor public policy to terminate three of the Navy's most effective aircraft along with the company that builds them, locking the Navy into total reliance on next-generation aircraft of unproven design and questionable affordability.    With the potential for reduction of U.S. troops around the world, the need for naval air power is even greater. It is puzzling then that the Pentagon recently cut some of the naval air &quot;punch&quot; by calling for fewer aircraft in each air wing. Could it be an attempt to mask the shortages? The gutting of naval aviation is irreversible because Grumman builds the four aircraft that are in shortage and the Cheney budget puts Grumman out of business. This eliminates competition, leaving the Navy with only one major company actively building naval aircraft, McDonnell Douglas Corp.    Rep. George J. Hochbrueckner (D., N.Y.)    Washington    ---   Funding the F-14D keeps Grumman in a position to offer competitive alternatives for future naval aircraft. Experience has shown that competition is necessary to produce the weapons systems we need at the costs we can afford.    W.B. Jones    Vice President, Public Affairs    Grumman Corp.    Bethpage, N.Y. </TEXT></DOC>
