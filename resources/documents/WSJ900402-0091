Advice From the Plaintiff Bar   ----   By Laurence Bodine</HL><DATE>04/02/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><LP>   Last year, our publication came out with its annual listof the largest jury awards in personal-injury cases. Theleader was a more than $152 million verdict in a caseinvolving lung disease. A Baltimore jury awarded more than$76 million each to two workers who had been exposed toasbestos in factory and shipyard jobs.   The defendant was Celotex Corp., a building productsmanufacturer based in Tampa, Fla. Celotex made litigationhistory with this mistake: It had offered only $2,500 tosettle one of the cases, and only $150 in the other. Celotexlawyers had used a chart, which listed an asbestos victim'sdisease in one column and the settlement offer in the next.</LP><TEXT>   This failure to make a meaningful offer in a lawsuitinvolving serious injury is one of the common, yet easilyavoidable, mistakes that result in multimillion-dollar juryawards.   Experienced plaintiff lawyers see the same mistakes againand again, and profit from them. One such lawyer is RichardGrand of Tucson, Ariz., who has won 60 jury verdicts orsettlements of $1 million or more in 31 years of lawpractice. He hasn't lost a jury trial since 1962. The totalamount insurance companies have paid in his cases is about$200 million. According to Mr. Grand, corporate managers andinsurance companies can avoid the unnecessary mistakes thatlead to these electrifying verdicts by handling litigationmore carefully.   -- Make a meaningful offer. The seven- and eight-figureverdicts typically involve a victim who suffered burns,paralysis, brain injury, death or a birth injury. Insurancecompanies have statistics on what these cases settle for. Thedefense should write appropriate offers to settle theselawsuits -- even if there is no settlement demand (and eventhough this goes against the common insurance-industrypractice).   Preceding every million-dollar verdict Mr. Grand hasobtained, he never has had an offer greater than 25% of theamount the jury awarded. Most of the offers were zerodollars. For example, in a 1985 case a five-year-old girl wasseverely burned when a camp stove spurted a stream of flamingfuel onto her. She sued Coleman Co., the camp-stovemanufacturer, and Coleman made no offer to settle. At trialMr. Grand proved that Coleman had known about the blowholefuel defect for 20 years, and the jury awarded $7.86 million.   Coleman refused to make a settlement offer after the trialor during the appeal. After the state Supreme Court affirmedthe verdict, Coleman paid $8.54 million, including interest.   -- Look at the courtroom record of the plaintiff lawyer.Insurance companies pay based not only on the injury but alsoon their fear of the plaintiff lawyer. According to Mr.Grand, insurance companies are &quot;grossly overpaying&quot; to settlecases where the plaintiff lawyer has never won a jury verdictof $1 million or more. Any lawyer can make a demand for sevenfigures, but only a limited number of lawyers canconsistently persuade a jury to make such an award.   For example, the defense should determine if the opposinglawyer is a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates. Membersof this organization have tried at least 50 cases to averdict, including at least one with a jury award of $1million or more. The average age is 60, and these areseasoned plaintiff lawyers who consistently obtain largesettlements. Other &quot;trial&quot; associations and academies includelawyers who have never tried a case.   -- Start settlement negotiations early. It is true that90% of all lawsuits settle, but most high-stakes injury casesare settled on the courthouse steps before the trial. Late inthe proceedings, both parties will be hardened in theirpositions, and will have spent great sums on experts anddepositions. An insurance carrier will spend $500,000 to $2million to defend a big case. Late settlements are costlysettlements.   But early on, a plaintiff lawyer will have incurred fewcosts and may agree to limit his contingency fee to settlethe case.   -- Retain a plaintiff lawyer as a defense consultant. Innegotiations, you should speak the language of the otherside. Insurance companies, however, rarely heed this advice.A highly seasoned plaintiff lawyer retained by the defensewill be an effective negotiator in settlement talks.   Unfortunately, lawyers in America tend to line up alongthe plaintiff or defense side and stay there, as has Mr.Grand, but it doesn't have to be this way. &quot;Most greatlawyers really would like to do what barristers do inEngland, which is handle either side of a case,&quot; Mr. Grandsays.   Plaintiff lawyers routinely engage settlement consultantsand negotiators. These are skilled specialists who advertisetheir availability for wrongful death and injury cases. Thedefense should not go it alone either, especially when thecase may end with a seven-figure verdict. Just as investmentbankers are brought in to assist with corporate mergers, thedefense should retain a plaintiff lawyer in a major injurycase.   -- Get the case into arbitration. It's not just for labordisputes any more. The goal from the plaintiff's side is toget money into the victim's hands. The goal from thedefense's side is to end the case. Arbitration is a quick andless formal way to resolve an injury case.   Many lawyers are reluctant to try arbitration. Alternativedispute resolution isn't familiar, and lawyers are taughtlittle about it in law school. But the ADR movement isgrowing, and a record 55,520 cases were filed in arbitrationin 1989 to settle $2.4 billion in claims, according to theAmerican Arbitration Association. Many were insurance andaccident claims.   In a case where a seven-figure verdict is possible,litigation will almost certainly take years, and appeals willadd more time. Mr. Grand represented a policeman who wasparalyzed from a gunshot wound in 1978. He won a $3.6 millionjury award that was upheld in 1982. The judgment was finallypaid in 1984, but only after the defense spent hundreds ofthousands of dollars vainly fighting the case, and filed forbankruptcy-law protection because of the verdict.   -- Is the defense lawyer in a feud? Most plaintiff lawyersdo not have a good relationship with defense counsel. Defenselawyers have emotions too, and can make their careers bydefeating a famous trial lawyer. A blood feud, however, canlead to a seven-figure verdict.   Corporate managers should interview their lawyers, just asthey would a new job applicant, and inquire at length howthey feel about the plaintiff lawyer.   ---   Mr. Bodine, an attorney, is the publisher of LawyersAlert, a Boston-based national legal-news magazine.</TEXT></DOC>
