The purpose of this systemis to be a versatile and user-friendly tool in the field of equipmentcommissioning or local interaction. The CERN interpreter Nodal has beenimplemented as the programming language and integrated into the Macintoshenvironment. The primary function of Macintrotte is to provide a stand-aloneCAMAC control system with a high-level user interface for programmersand end users. In this kind of application, a CERN-made CAMAC interfaceis used. This has been the main use of the system during the early phaseof the LPI commissioning. A secondary function of Macintrotte is to actas a front-end computer for the SMACC, a 68000-based auxiliary cratecontroller used in the PS central control network. In this configuration,the Macintosh is connected as a terminal to the SMACC to provide localaccess, basic input/output and autonomous computational facilities. Thisis currently used for LPI equipment which is interfaced with the maincontrol system. A third function of the system is to interconnect, ina LAN (local area network), SMACCs and Macintoshes in order to providehigh-level local control facilities for machine development and to extendthe functionality of the main consoles. This is still experimental andhas not yet been used in operation. This paper gives an overview of thesystem and describes its use for the commissioning of the LPI equipmentand the experience the authors gained from this application.</TEXT></DOC>
