RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to decidewhether states must continue to provide lawyers for indigent deathrow inmates after they have lost their initial round of appeals.   The court said it will hear an appeal by Virginia officials whosaid requiring states to pay for attorneys in such cases could leadto interminable delays in carrying out executions.   The justices are expected to announce their decision in 1989.   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 6-4 ruling lastJune, said condemned murderers in Virginia who cannot afford alawyer are entitled to greater representation at taxpayer expensethan the state provides.   Attorneys are provided by the state when a death row inmatefiles an initial appeal in state courts.   Convicted killers who lose that round may pursue a second roundof appeals in state courts, contending that their rights wereviolated. But they are not entitled to free legal representationduring this second phase if they are unable to afford their ownlawyer.   Like other states, Virginia provides prison law libraries andassigns part-time lawyers to help inmates prepare theirsecond-round _ or collateral _ appeals. In some cases, volunteerlawyers are available to help the prisoners.   But the 4th Circuit court said the Constitution requires more inthe case of those on death row.   ``The complexity and difficulty of the legal work involved inchallenging a death penalty require particular safeguards in orderto insure meaningful access'' to justice, the appeals court said.   The appeals court also noted that inmates facing execution arelikely to be emotionally incapable of preparing a cogent appeal.   But the appeals court said death row inmates are not entitled tofree legal help for a third round of appeals _ when they take theircases to federal court to claim their rights were violated.   By the time the case reaches the federal courts, the appealscourt said, the inmates will have legal briefs, trial transcriptsand state court opinions from earlier state court appeals that willenable them to prepare their own defense effectively.   Virginia officials said the 4th Circuit court ruling ``injects apalpable danger of infinite delay'' in resolving capital cases.   The added guarantee of free legal representation will give deathrow inmates another opportunity to contend that they receivedineffective assistance from their lawyers, the officials said. Thatcould lead to another protracted round of appeals, they continued.   The officials also said that most states with capital punishmentdo not guarantee free legal help beyond the first round of appeals.   The state attorney general's office interpreted a 1987 SupremeCourt ruling to mean that the Constitution does not guarantee aright to a lawyer in collateral appeals.   In the 1987 case, the justices ruled that a Pennsylvania woman'sconstitutional right to adequate legal help had not been violatedduring an earlier appeal. She claimed she was denied effectiverepresentation when her court-appointed lawyer concluded that hercollateral appeal was fruitless.   The 4th Circuit court said the 1987 ruling did not answer theconstitutional question raised in the Virginia case, particularlysince the Pennsylvania case did not involve the death penalty.   The case is Murray vs. Giarratano, 88-411.</TEXT></DOC>
