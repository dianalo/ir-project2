Despite exhaustion and some thinning of their ranks, studentprotesters decided today to press on with their 10-day occupationof the square until the government falls.   The vandalism of Mao's gigantic portrait with red, black andblue paint by two young men was akin to blasphemy and an isolatedincident in a remarkably peaceful popular rebellion that hasgalvanized much of the country.   A Chinese journalist who saw the attack said the two, wearingthe white headbands of student protesters, were seized by students.   Student leaders said later that the vandals' whereabouts wereunknown and insisted the two were not students.   Mao was Communist China's founder and ruled the country for 27years until his death in 1976. His uniform and the blue skybackground were splattered and dots marred his chin and smearedbetween his eyes.   Workers later covered the painting with a tarp.   The pro-democracy student movement, launched last month withmarches and class boycotts demanding press freedom and an end toofficial corruption, has won such widespread popular support as totame martial law, which Premier Li declared in Beijing on Saturday.   Today's march in the square was at least the third such hugeoutpouring of support for the students in a week. Marchers calledfor the resignation of Li, senior leader Deng Xiaoping andPresident Yang Shangkun.   Intellectuals from the Chinese Academy of Sciences led theprotest, accusing Li of staging a military coup in his strugglewith Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang. Li apparently acted onorders of the 84-year-old Deng.   ``People unite and break the militaristic coup,'' read oneposter. ``Bury the cult of the individual. End old people'spolitics,'' read another.   A bus designed by the Central Academy of Fine Arts broadcast fora free press. A painting on the bus showed red lips crisscrossed bytwo rifles. ``We will not be silenced,'' read one slogan.   Heavy showers ended most of the protest suddenly. Studentswandered about the square with sheets of plastic over their heads.Others held wet flags.   Several hundred men wearing blue raincoats bicycled to thesquare through the rain, chanting ``Li Peng, step down.''   The rest of the capital was calm, with subways reopened and manybus lines running, after a tense weekend in which hundreds ofthousands of people spontaneously set up roadblocks to protect thestudents from troops.   Many military and Communist Party leaders have opposed usingtroops to crack down on the demonstrators.   Student leaders met today and decided, despite the exodus ofthousands of demonstrators who are returning to their schools, tocontinue their occupation of the square that is China's symboliccenter of power.   It was not known how the vandalism of the Mao painting, one ofCommunist China's most important symbols, would affect the protest.   ``I voted that we should go back because many of the Beijingstudents are already leaving,'' said Gua Haifeng, a student leaderfrom Beijing University. ``But the student union insists onstruggling until the end. They want to see the government fall.''   More than half of the protesters on the square hail from outsideBeijing.   ``We just couldn't leave,'' said a student from Lanzhou, awestern city about 750 miles from Beijing. ``Tiananmen Square isthe center of our student movement. If it died, the movement inLanzhou and all around China would die, too.''   Protesters said Li and Yang had were trying to take over thegovernment by replacing ministers and using troops to occupyimportant media outlets.   A source at the People's Daily earlier had said that troops hadoccupied that newspaper along with the official Xinhua News Agency,and the central television and radio stations.   But the allegations about replaced ministers could not beconfirmed nor could a rumor that Li had taken the responsibilityfor propaganda out of the hands of Politburo member Hu Qili.   Rumor and innuendo filled Beijing. Intellectuals, most of whomsympathize with Zhao, a relatively liberal reformer, have been asmuch to blame as the supporters of Li and Yang, both conservatives.   Earlier reports said Zhao had offered to resign his post aschief of the Communist Party in meetings during the second week ofMay. Now, the same sources are saying Zhao prepared his resignationpapers but reneged at the last minute when he saw Li becomingincreasingly weak.   Indeed, Li's inability to carry out the martial law crackdownhas hurt his position. On Monday, senior military officers andlegislators criticized the crackdown.   Seven high-ranking officers, including former Defense MinisterZhang Aiping, wrote an open letter to the People's Daily, sayingthat ``to keep the situation from worsening, the army cannot enterthe city.''   Chinese sources said members of the National People's Congressbegan collecting signatures to open a special session to considerthe legality of martial law.   Central Radio reported that several soldiers were seriouslyinjured in a brief clash Monday night with local residents insouthwest Beijing. It said some had been hospitalized. Severallocal residents were also hurt.</TEXT></DOC>
