<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0048 </DOCNO><TEXT>The combination of certain solvent extraction separations and a specialkind of liquid scintillation detector and electronics designed for alphaspectrometry allows some highly accurate, yet simple determinations ofalpha-emitting nuclides. Counting efficiency is 99.68% with backgroundsof andless;0.02 cpm. Energy resolution and peak position are sufficient forthe identification of many nuclides. Rejection of interference from {beta}and {gamma} radiation is andgt;99.95%. The Photon/Electron Rejecting AlphaLiquid Scintillation (PERALS) equipment is described and procedures forthe separation and determination of uranium, thorium, plutonium, polonium,radium, and trivalent actinides are outlined. 25 refs., 10 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
