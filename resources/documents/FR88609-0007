FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant material.The agency concludes that the proposed uses of this food additive are safe,and that the regulations should be amended to allow for the use of thissubstance as a crystallization accelerator, formulation aid, lubricantand release agent, surface-finishing agent, and winterization and fractionationaid for use in or on food. FDA has listed this additive under the name``glyceryl tristearate'' to reflect conventional chemical nomenclaturepractice. Some of the technical effects for which FDA is regulating the additive(formulation aid, surface-finishing agent, and winterization and fractionationaid) were not listed in the filing notice. The agency is taking this actionbecause, after reviewing the petition, it concluded that it was necessaryto include these technical effects in the regulations to fully reflectthe uses requested by the petitioner. Furthermore, the agency did not includethe technical effect ``compressing aid'' because that technical effectis included under the term ``formulation aid,'' as defined in andSection;170.3(o)(14) (21 CFR 170.3(o)(14)). In accordance with andSection; 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition andthe documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decisionto approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contactperson listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will deletefrom the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosurebefore making the documents available for inspection. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action and has concluded that the action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statementis not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and theevidence supporting that finding may be seen in the Dockets ManagementBranch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.Under FDA's regulations implementing the National Environmental PolicyAct (21 CFR Part 25), an action of this type would require an abbreviatedenvironmental assessment under 21 CFR 25.31a(b)(5). Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at anytime on or before July 11, 1988, file with the Dockets Management Branch(address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separatelynumbered, and each numbered objection shall specify with particularitythe provisions of the regulation to which objection is made and the groundsfor the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requestedshall specifically so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particularobjection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection.Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall includea detailed description and analysis of the specific factual informationintended to be presented in support of the objection in the event thata hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis forany particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearingon the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted andshall be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the headingof this document. Any objections received in response to the regulationmay be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,Monday through Friday. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 172  </ITAG>Food additives.Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under theauthority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and redelegatedto the Director or Deputy Director of the Center For Food Safety and AppliedNutrition, Part 172 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 172_FOOD ADDITIVES PERMITTED FOR DIRECT ADDITION TO FOOD FORHUMAN CONSUMPTION </ITAG>1.
