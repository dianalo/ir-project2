The 15-member committee ended six days of closed-door talksThursday night, its first session since Palestine LiberationOrganization Chairman Yasser Arafat met Syrian President HafezAssad in Damascus on April 25.   The Arafat-Hassad meeting ended a 5-year-old feud.   The committee, which rarely announces in detail what decisionsit reaches, vowed in a communique issued late Thursday to``redouble revolutionary effort by all ways and means and in allfields.''   It did not elaborate, but it was widely interpreted as meaningan intensification of the 5-month-old uprising in the West Bank andGaza Strip against 20 years of Israeli occupation.   It was also seen as an indication that the PLO plans to step upguerrilla attacks on Israel.   An Israeli force pushed into south Lebanon on Monday in atwo-day raid against Palestinian guerrillas and their Moslem allieswho have carried out several raids into Israel in recent weeks.   The Israelis reported killing 40 pro-Iranian Shiite Moslemmilitiamen during the sweep. Three Israeli soldiers also died.   The communique said the PLO leadership has ``taken all necessarymeasures to maintain the uprising in the occupied territories andto enhance the steadfastness of our people under occupation.''   Arafat's reconciliation with Assad in the wake of the April 16assassination of PLO military commander Khalil Wazir _ believed tobe the PLO's main strategist in the Israeli uprising _ could be aplus for the PLO.   The reconciliation would strengthen the PLO's guerrilla campaignagainst the Israelis. The Syrians control north and east Lebanon,where they have about 25,000 troops, and could provide valuablelogistical assistance for cross-border raids.</TEXT></DOC>
