Valerie Martin has taken a fresh look at Robert LouisStevenson's classic tale of the doppelganger that lurks in each ofus and written ``Mary Reilly'' (Doubleday, $18.95), which is ``TheStrange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' as told by the housemaid.   In Stevenson's version, the housemaid is glimpsed only briefly,weeping loudly at the sight of Dr. Jekyll's soliciter, who has beensummoned to the house to investigate possible foul play by Mr.Hyde. She is never named.   Martin dubbed her Mary Reilly, had her learn to read and writeat a school financed by Jekyll's largesse and set her to keeping adiary of the goings-on at the well-appointed mansion. She gets aneyeful, what with Mr. Hyde wandering through the house at odd hoursand Dr. Jekyll sending her to seedy Soho on mysterious errands.   Martin, in a recent interview, is asked if anyone has said toher: How dare you fiddle with a classic?   ``I could say I didn't fiddle with it at all. There's been a lotof fiddling with it _ whole new plots added on,'' she said, areference to film versions that have provided the scientist with afiancee and so forth. ``I think I've stayed very respectifullyinside of that framework. Nothing that happened in Stevenson's bookhas been changed. ... I didn't give him any girlfriend.''   Martin often assigns ``Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' to her studentsat the University of Massachusetts, near Amherst, where she teachesgraduate creative writing and undergraduate literature courses. Sheoffered several explanations as to why the book, published in 1886,endures.   ``It's the old, traditional `proud man brought low' tale. Also,it's a horror story. The idea of the terrible thing being insiderather than outside adds sort of a fatal quality to it. ... It'salso very dreamlike and atmospheric _ very quickstroke and clean''in the telling.   Although Stevenson's story predates Freudian analysis, Martinthinks that's another reason for its appeal: ``There is sort of aconsensus that psychologically this is an accurate description of arepression complex.''   ``What interested me about it is that we seem to have boughtinto the notion that repressed anger should be expressed. But thisbook describes something I think is very true _ that the expressionof it only intensifies it,'' she said, citing studies that showthat the more often one commits violence, the easier it becomes.   Mary Reilly is an engaging, believable narrator _ an energeticworker who takes pride in a job well done and who speaks her mindwhen Jekyll asks. Martin has succeeded at the tricky balancing actof rendering such a character articulate without making her soundtoo educated. She also has succeeded in crafting a story that isabsorbing even though the reader already knows the outcome.   To get the protagonist's voice right, Martin dug up journals ofservants _ not easy to find, since most were illiterate _ inlibraries on both sides of the Atlantic, toured Victorianrestorations to get a sense of how such households were set up, andeven blacked a woodstove with polish to gain firsthand experience.   ``I never did find out why they swept tea leaves on thecarpet,'' Martin confessed, although the reader finds Mary Reillydutifully doing so because the author's research showed it was acommon task.   ``Part of the quality that she has does come from journals thatI read'' of servants who took pride in their work, Martin said.``You've got to find some way to feel that your work is worth doingor your life is essentially worthless.''   Martin is aware that although virtually everyone knows theJekyll and Hyde story, many may not have read the Stevensonoriginal.   ``I tried to `dis-remember' all the previous movie versions andtreatments (when writing `Mary Reilly'). I hope that my book isenjoyable, just as a read, all by itself,'' she said, hoping thatreaders ``would understand everything they need to know about theoriginal.''   Martin, a soft-spoken woman who phrases her words carefully, haswritten five previous novels, including ``The Consolidation ofNature,'' ``A Recent Martyr'' and ``Alexandria.'' She is oftenlabeled a Gothic writer, which she thinks probably stems from herSouthern roots. She was born in Missouri and raised in New Orleans,although she has no trace of a Southern accent.   ``I'm never quite sure what people mean by Gothic,'' she said.Asked for her own definition, she replied mischievously, ``I thinkthere's a lot of humidity in Gothic novels'' _ fog and vapor andsuch.   Film rights for ``Mary Reilly'' have been purchased by WarnerBros. Roman Polanski has expressed interest in directing it.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, March 30-April 1</NOTE></DOC>
