The strongest wording in the draft resolution was dropped Mondayso Iran would continue cooperating with U.N. human rightsinvestigations and let the Red Cross visit its prisons.   Draft language criticizing ``executions, ill-treatment andtorture'' in Iran was deleted by the assembly subcommittee dealingwith human rights. The adopted draft expresses concern over``allegations of violations of human rights'' in a U.N. report.   Iran joined in the consensus Tuesday to recommend sending theresolution to the full General Assembly, where it will be adoptedlater this month.   At the same hour the resolution was adopted, London-basedAmnesty said Iran has executed more than 5,000 people in the pastthree years. Many people were killed for their political beliefs,the organization said.   Amnesty officials said it was coincidence that the release ofthe report came on the same day as the resolution vote.   Isobelle Jaques, Amnesty International's delegate to the UnitedNations, criticized the compromise wording of the resolution.   ``I feel that the resolution ought to address the actual humanrights situation in Iran,'' she said. ``I don't think that theresolution which was adopted today really reflects that.''   But a European diplomat involved in the compromise defended it,saying it ``contains the substance of the original resolution'' inreturn for securing Iran's cooperation. The diplomat spoke oncondition of anonymity.   ``It's not ideal, but it's significant,'' added Saleh Rajavi, aU.N. representative for the People's Mujahedeen of Iran, an exilegroup seeking to topple Iran's Moslem fundamentalist government.   ``What's important is that the continuation of the monitoring ofrights abuses in Iran is still stipulated as a mandate of the U.N.body,'' Rajavi said.   ``It was a failure for the Iranian regime,'' he said. ``Theyadmitted in that resolution to their own crimes.''   Amnesty International's report said Iranian dissidents arearrested and tortured, some for only signing a letter criticizing alack of human rights and freedoms.   The organization quoted former prisoners as saying a ``deathcommission'' of Iranian officials chose prisoners daily forexecution if their views were not acceptable.   In 1988, more than 2,500 political prisoners were killedsecretly in a few months on orders of the commission, AmnestyInternational said.   Thousands more have been executed after summary trials in whichthey were convicted of criminal offenses, it said. Crackdowns ondrug trafficking led to more than 1,100 executions in 1989, itsaid.   The U.N. report used as the basis for the resolution wasprepared by Reynaldo Galindo Pohl of El Salvador, who has donecritical U.N. reports on Iran's human rights abuses since 1984. Hewas only allowed to visit the country in the last year.   Tehran invited Galindo because his previous reports were basedheavily on testimony from exiles and emigres who resent Iran'stheocracy.   Galindo's latest U.N. report was not as harsh as many humanrighs advocates might have hoped, but it severely criticized theclimate of fear he found in Iran and noted many executions andabuses of due process.   The original resolution would have had the General Assemblyexpress ``its concern about the numerous allegations of violationsof human rights contained in the report ... notably thoseconcerning executions, ill-treatment and torture.''   The draft now calls on Iran to ``investigate and rectify thehuman rights issues raised by the special representative, inparticular as regards administration of justice and due process oflaw.''   Responding to the Amnesty report, Iran's official news agencyIRNA said Galindo reported that ``many of the people listed byAmnesty International as having been executed are actually stillalive.'' The news agency said Galindo spoke with four of them in aTehran prison.   IRNA said the names were on a list given to AmnestyInternational by the Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group.   Amnesty said it would have no comment until it reviewed the IRNAstatement.</TEXT></DOC>
