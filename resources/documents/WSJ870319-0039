Traders were most impressed with the British government's forecast that its budget deficit, or public sector borrowing requirement, would be only four billion pounds. The market had been looking for a deficit of five billion to six billion pounds, analysts said.    &quot;That's startling news,&quot; said Dennis Gartman, president of Gartman Financial Services Inc, in Portsmouth, Va. &quot;It's long-term, incredibly bullish for the pound.&quot; Mr. Gartman and other analysts said it represents an impressive fiscal performance by the British. Added Craig Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., &quot;It's being well regarded. The market wants to see the U.K. get its fiscal house in order and not go on a big spending spree.&quot;    In modest trading, June British pound futures closed at 1.5950, up .0070.    &quot;The sterling was consistently strong,&quot; said Mr. Gartman. He said he was especially impressed in light of remarks by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson that he was &quot;perfectly content&quot; with the pound's exchange rate. Mr. Gartman said it seemed that Mr. Lawson would prefer a weaker pound to help the U.K.'s export business. But Mr. Lawson's remarks didn't dampen enthusiasm for the pound.    And neither did the news that British banks cut the base lending rate 1/2 point to 10%, which would normally draw a bearish reaction. The pound opened firmer and remained strong all day, the analysts said. And since it was a second-day reaction to news of the British budget, some analysts think the market may be poised for a long-term bullish sentiment toward the pound.    &quot;The U.K. suddenly looks more attractive,&quot; said Mr. Sloane.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Futures prices turned lower, in what one analyst termed a &quot;pause&quot; after prices had risen in several consecutive sessions to the highest levels in eight weeks. Fundamentals remain strong for the long-term, he said, with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries apparently holding to its production agreement. But a perception that the market has been &quot;drastically&quot; overbought for the short-term caused prices to decline. Product prices were weak, most notably heating oil, and this tended to drag down the whole complex, he said. Crude prices were down slightly and resisted the decline. At one point the April crude price topped $19 a barrel, but couldn't sustain the advance. The market appeared to be consolidating prior to making another run at $19, the analyst said. The American Petroleum Institute figures released late Tuesday showed a decline in petroleum product inventories, but refinery runs were a bit higher and the net effect was neutral, one analyst said.    SUGAR: Futures prices eased after two days of gains. After a steady start, prices declined following news that the European Economic Community had offered 60,500 metric tons of processed beet sugar for sale. The quantity was about as expected, but the subsidy of 44.819 European Currency Units per ton, to be paid to trade houses on whose behalf the EEC was selling the sugar, was higher than expected, analysts said. They said the higher subsidy appeared to be intended to keep trade interests from offering very large quantities of sugar into the Community's intervention fund, as had been threatened. One analyst said that long-recurring reports of Cuba's crop difficulties may have been somewhat exaggerated. &quot;There's a growing concensus that the crop may not be as bad as some thought,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York. Estimates of Cuban production recently ranged as low as six million metric tons, compared with 7,350,000 tons last year, Mr. O'Neill said. &quot;Now the talk is more like seven million tons or slightly more, which could change the picture entirely,&quot; he said. Mr. O'Neill said that one indication that Cuba may not be having as much trouble as had been thought was that, contrary to expectations, the nation hadn't become an aggressive buyer on the world market to meet its shipment commitments. One trade source said Cuba's crop, which was hurt by Hurricane Kate two years ago, began recovering at the beginning of this season and may have contributed to a better than expected harvest.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Fears of a summer shortage sent pork belly futures prices soaring by the maximum daily limit of $2. Movement of bellies, uncured slabs of bacon, into storage continues to be slight, compared with the year-earlier period. Last week 315,000 pounds of bellies were moved into out-of-town storage, compared with 2.3 million pounds the year before. A cold storage report due from the Agriculture Department tomorrow should show a 34% decline in stocks compared with the year-ago period, said Charles Levitt, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago. Cattle and hog prices were also higher. </TEXT></DOC>
