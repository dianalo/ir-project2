The measure, which also contains provisions that wouldbenefit fledgling competitors of cable, passed on a voicevote with no dissent.</LP><TEXT>   The impetus for such a measure has been sizable increasesin monthly cable fees since rates were largely deregulated 31/2 years ago. In some cases, rates have doubled or tripled,although increases have been moderating in recent months.   The National Cable Television Association said it was&quot;very troubled by the bill and does not support it.&quot; Amongother things, NCTA President James Mooney cited the bill's&quot;preoccupation with holding rates down.&quot; Still, the prospectof cable legislation passing both houses this year hasimproved, especially now that telephone companies essentiallyhave lost their bid to enter the cable business this year.   The bill calls for the Federal Communications Commissionto establish a maximum fee that cable operators could chargefor a basic tier of cable service consisting of broadcastsignals carried by cable companies and public education andgovernment channels.   Fees for other channels carried by cable would beregulated on a case-by-case basis when authorities suspectprice gouging. The FCC would develop criteria to identifyabusive or unreasonable rates, and states or local cablefranchising authorities would alert the FCC about rateincreases that appeared unreasonable or abusive. Under thebill, the FCC could review and roll back the recent flurry ofcable rate increases and &quot;re-tiering&quot; -- repacking channelsin a way to boost revenues.   In a major step to help emerging competitors to cable,such as so-called wireless cable and direct broadcastsatellite, the legislation calls for cable programmers thatare owned wholly or in part by cable operators to sellprogramming to cable competitors. Specifically, it barsprogrammers with ties to cable operators from unreasonablyrefusing to sell programming to cable competitors, althoughit recognizes exclusive arrangements that don't hurtcompetition as a legitimate business strategy.   The measure also would require the FCC to developcustomer-service standards that would be monitored by localauthorities.   Cable interests were buoyed when a long-shot effort bytelephone companies to drum up votes to allow them into thecable business flopped, pushing the issue back at least untilnext year. &quot;After all the smoke and noise,&quot; Mr. Mooney said,&quot;telco-TV didn't have the votes.&quot; Phone companies argue thatthey must be permitted to provide video entertainmentservices to pay for the additional expenses of updating theirnetworks with optical fiber.   Also yesterday, the FCC released a summary of itslong-awaited report to Congress on the cable industry. Itrecommended a series of steps to encourage competitors, butsaid it didn't endorse reregulation of rates or service. TheFCC didn't address the matter of allowing phone companiesinto the cable business but is handling that issue in aseparate proceeding.   The report isn't likely to have a huge impact on CapitolHill. The essence of some of the key recommendations isalready contained in the legislation that has passed both theSenate and House Commerce panels. An example is requiringvertically integrated cable companies to sell programming tocompetitors but recognizing exclusive arrangements as a soundbusiness strategy. Besides, major amendments on the floor,especially efforts to ditch rate reregulation, could torpedothe whole effort.   In the 10-page summary, the commission recommended thatCongress bar local franchising authorities from unreasonablykeeping out new cable competitors. It also said that Congressshould limit local governments' regulation of theinstallation of multi-channel video reception equipment to&quot;clearly defined health, safety or reasonable aestheticobjectives.&quot;   It also recommended must-carry provisions requiring cablecompanies to carry local broadcasters, and restrictingchanges in channel assignments so that cable operatorscouldn't bounce around broadcast stations on the dial.   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the ConsumerFederation of America, predicted the FCC report would havelittle influence on current legislation. He applauded theHouse committee's bill, saying he was particularly pleasedwith language that strengthens consumer protections overrepackaging cable service, specific regulation overremote-control devices and converter boxes, and an expandedprovision directing the FCC to look for backdoor rateincreases.   Some lawmakers, however, are concerned that both the Houseand Senate legislation include too few consumer protectionsand generally do little to help competitors, serving mostlyto entrench cable as a monopoly. Rep. Jim Cooper (D., Tenn.),a strong critic of the reregulation effort, said &quot;I hope weare able to have future cable bills -- beginning next year.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
