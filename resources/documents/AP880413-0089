He completely denies the existence of the (Nazi) gas chambers.''   Ms. Le Pen said her ex-husband used racial slurs to refer toJews and called Adolf Hitler ``Uncle Dolphie,'' when saying, forinstance, ``Uncle Dolphie didn't go far enough.''   She made similar comments in an interview published last week inthe Socialist-leaning monthly magazine Globe. The statements havespiced up a presidential campaign described by French politicalobservers as listless and lacking serious debate.   A spokesman for Le Pen, Alain Vizier, said neither he nor thecandidate would comment on Ms. Le Pen's remarks.   Le Pen, 59, a former paratrooper and Foreign Legionnaire, hasoften been charged with racism, but has won libel cases against hisaccusers.   Running on an anti-immigration platform with slogans such as``Keep France French,'' Le Pen says North African workers should besent back home and social benefits should go first to the nativeFrench.   Ms. Le Pen, who left her husband in 1984 after 25 years ofmarriage, raised eyebrows last year when she appeared half-nude inPlayboy magazine in a series of seductive poses.   In the interviews, she is quoted as saying that her willingnessto divulge family secrets was aimed at getting back personalpossessions, including the ashes of her mother, family photos,letters, furniture, and money.   Ms. Le Pen is quoted as saying she has sued seven times for thereturn of her possessions and lost.   Last fall, Le Pen caused a scandal when he said during a radiointerview that the question of whether Nazi gas chambers existedwas merely a ``detail of World War II.''   Le Pen leans heavily in his campaign rallies on the themes ofGod and family, saying he is the only candidate to do so.   But Ms. Le Pen is quoted in Rolling Stone as saying that herformer husband ``had no sense of the morality which should reignwithin a family ... (and) was completely contrary to the image hewants to give.''   She said he did not strongly discipline the couple's threedaughters, who, she now says, refuse to see their mother.   Le Pen, whose National Front party has 33 deputies in the577-seat National Assembly, is ranked fourth in opinion pollsbehind Socialist President Francois Mitterrand and the two mainconservative candidates, Premier Jacques Chirac and former PremierRaymond Barre.   The latest opinion polls give Le Pen as much as 12 percent ofthe vote.</TEXT></DOC>
