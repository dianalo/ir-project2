Nelson once wasdescribed as ``walking a beat with one foot in the Twilight Zone.''He's in it up to his elbows now, at the price of a once-promisingcareer.   Nelson, former chief of detectives in Hendricks County west ofhere, quit when Sheriff Roy W. Waddell told him he no longer couldpursue an investigation of satanic rituals that began with a spateof grave desecrations 18 months ago.   A private investigator now, he helps alleged victims ofsatanists. But he finds there's little demand for his services.   Nelson, 40, an Indianapolis native who grew up in California andreturned here after a hitch in the Army, was a well-respecteddetective in September 1987, when an isolated complaint of gravetampering began a quiet obsession.   The headstones of a small family plot had been turned over anddesecrated in a wooded, secluded area of Hendricks County. A manwho lived nearby, after overhearing a barroom conversation, hadgone out to see for himself.   ``He was in tears, he could hardly talk, he was alleging it wasdevil worshipers,'' Nelson said in an interview in the office heconverted from his home's family room.   Rumors of satanism had permeated the county for years. Nelson,in his only previous brush with the occult, had been on patrol oncein the area when he came across what he believed was a circle ofdevil worshipers. That experience had left him shaken.   News of the grave descration prompted others to come forwardwith similar stories, and Nelson soon had 15 graves that had beendisturbed at seven sites over a year and a half. There also wereghoulish details such as reports of red-robed cultists gatheringnear the home of a convicted murderess and an alleged attack on amotorist by a hooded man with a spiked glove.   As circumstance would have it, it also was Halloween season. ByJanuary, Nelson and his ``Twilight Zone'' beat had attractednational publicity.   It was heady stuff for Nelson, but it was becoming a headachefor local officials concerned about the image of their suburbancommunity. The detective, meanwhile, was coming up with ``a ton ofleads'' but making little headway in the case.   ``Effective immediately,'' began the letter from Sheriff Waddellon Jan. 1988, ``you will discontinue any investigation of thereported disturbances of graves and the gathering of intelligencepertaining to satanic cults.''   By Feb. 15, Nelson was transferred to uniformed patrol.   ``I was taken back. I was speechless,'' Nelson said. But hepursued the investigation on his own time until he was reminded hestill represented the department and should cease and desist. Heceased being a Hendricks County deputy on May 26.   ``If the sheriff had his way, you never would have heard aboutit,'' Nelson says. ``It's hard for people to believe it does exist.   ``I think it's more important for the people to know about thisand to know how to deal with this than to keep it covered up.''   In Nelson's office, amid the law enforcement plaques andcertificates, the volumes devoted to ``Understanding HumanBehavior'' and his third wife's collection of owl figurines, hereserves a corner for occult memorabilia: voodoo dolls, pentagrams,record albums by heavy metal bands such as Motley Crue andMegadeth, and confiscated notebooks in which devilish rites aredetailed.   Satanists are guilty of not only grave robbery but also arson,rape, kidnapping, brainwashing and even child sacrifice, Nelsonsays. He compares the public apathy to the light regard for thedrug culture in the 1950s. ``Look at us now,'' he says.   ``The whole criminal justice system is inept when it comes tothese kinds of allegations,'' he says.   ``We've got to get people to believe. People believe it occursonly in television and movies, but it doesn't. It's out there. It'ssucking up adolescents left and right.''   Dale Griffis of Tiffin, Ohio, a former police detective and nowa widely respected consultant on such matters, agrees with Nelson.   `There's a lot of catch-up ball being played now'' by lawenforcement officials and mental health professionals, Griffis says.   Nelson as a private detective, however, hasn't been able toattract much business. He said he sometimes regrets leaving thesheriff's department, and has inquired about joining other policeagencies, but his age is working against him. And he won't give uptrying to expose satanists.   Nelson shares what he's learned in lectures and police seminars,but receives little compensation for it other than his expenses.He's writing a book, but confesses he needs help organizing it anddoesn't have a publisher lined up.   His last occult-related case was in December, when he was hiredto help in a civil suit a Michigan woman was pursuing to help herdaughter and grandchild, whom the woman thought faced a threat ofchild sacrifice, Nelson says.   He takes on non-occult work as well, but there isn't enough toput food on the table. That's up to his wife, Phyllis, who directssecurity at a local auto plant.   ``If my wife didn't have a good job we'd be starving,'' he says.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 7</NOTE></DOC>
