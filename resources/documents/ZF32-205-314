(Contracts).andO;Ticker:    AMH.andO;Product:   UTS 2.1 (Operating system) (Medical use)Amdahl 5995-700A (Mainframe computer) (Medical use).andO;Topic:     SalesMainframe ComputersHospital Information Systems.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Marshfield Clinic, under a $5 million contract awarded to Amdahl Corp., hasinstalled a large-scale UNIX system that will run more than 1,000 commercialapplications and serve over 1,200 users on an Amdahl mainframe computer.andM;According to Joseph Francesconi, Amdahl's senior vice president of opensystems operations, the Marshfield installation is one of the largest in theUnited States to employ a mainframe UNIX system for online transactionprocessing and mission-critical applications.andM;The Amdahl system replaces three smaller mainframes.andP;  It includes an Amdahl5995-700A mainframe computer with 192 megabytes of main storage and 128megabytes of expanded storage.andP;  The mainframe will exclusively run UTSRelease 2.1, Amdahl's UNIX operating system.andM;Marshfield Clinic anticipates a one-year conversion effort for allapplications to be ported early this summer.andP;  Applications cover all facetsof the clinic's operation, including general accounting, medical recordmanagement, patient and physician scheduling, satellite clinic operations andlaboratory reporting.andM;&quot;Our highest priority was to go to an open systems environment because of theadvantages it offers,&quot; said Peter Bauer, director of information systems atMarshfield Clinic.andM;&quot;Unix systems inherently offer scaleability, portability and connectivityelements which are unavailable in proprietary environments,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Also, the computer science departments in universities and collegesthroughout the United States are producing graduates predominantly literatein UNIX system and C-Language applications.andP;  This will greatly facilitate therecruitment of programming personnel for UNIX system environments.andM;&quot;Amdahl was chosen as our vendor because the company offers the most robustlarge-scale UNIX system implementation available in today's market,&quot; Baueradded.andM;&quot;The Marshfield installation is evidence of the growing acceptance oflarge-scale UNIX systems in commercial applications,&quot; Amdahl's Francesconisaid.andM;&quot;Because we have more than 15 years experience as an IBM-compatible vendor inthe commercial marketplace and have over 10 years experience in developinglarge-scale UNIX systems, we understand the characteristics and needs of bothenvironments sufficiently to offer highly effective open systemsalternatives.&quot;andM;Amdahl's UTS Release 2.1 operating system fully complies with ATandamp;T's UNIXSystem V Release 3.1 and is the only standalone UNIX system for System/390compatible processors.andP;  The system can run in native mode on a dedicatedAmdahl processor or in a domain on mainframes equipped with Amdahl's MultipleDomain Feature (MDF).andM;MDF allows a single computer to be partitioned into several independentsystems, and the Marshfield Clinic employs three domains: one fordevelopment, one for testing of applications and one for running productionworkloads.andM;The Marshfield system also employs Amdahl direct-access storage devices(DASD), which have 130 gigabytes of capacity, and uses one of the company's6110 solid-state storage devices.andM;In addition to its mainframe computers, data storage subsystems and UNIXsystem software, Amdahl is also a supplier of data communications productsand educational and consulting services.andP;  With annual sales in excess of $2billion, its products are sold in more than 25 countries for use in both opensystems environments and the IBM-compatible marketplace.andM;Marshfield Clinic in one of the leading health care centers in the UnitedStates with over 350 physicians and a support staff of 2,300 offeringvirtually every medical specialty to its patients.andP;  Its main campus inMarshfield and its 17 regional centers accommodate over 700,000 patientvisits per year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
