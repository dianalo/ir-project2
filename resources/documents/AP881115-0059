School officials say at least a dozen of the Macintosh computersat the suburban San Fernando Valley campus have been affected by avirus that was discovered last week.   A computer virus is akin to a living virus, and can spread fromterminal to terminal and even computer system to computer system by``infected'' discs. It can disrupt such functions as word processingand printing.   Some viruses can even destroy valuable files, but Cal Stateofficials said the bug found there does not erase data. It doesstall computers, though, and removal requires hours ofreprogramming, officials said.   Students' computer discs are being tested for the virus beforethey are able to rent a Macintosh at the university bookstore.   Earlier this month, another virus duplicated itself in universityand government research computers nationwide, slowing the computers'processing speeds and filled up their memories. A graduate studentis under investigation in that case.</TEXT></DOC>
