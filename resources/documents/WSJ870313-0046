Whitfield, a former account executive and broker at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., for allegedly diverting $8,400 from the firm for his own use.    According to the indictment, Mr. Whitfield, 31 years old, opened a trading account with Merrill Lynch under a fictitious name in February 1986. The government alleged that Mr. Whitfield then deposited a check from another Merrill Lynch client in the account, withdrawing $8,400 from the account for his own use five months later. The government said Mr. Whitfield used the money as part of a down-payment to buy real estate.    Mr. Whitfield's attorney, Robert Julian Lashaw of the Fishman andamp; Forman law firm, said only that the case is &quot;totally unrelated to any other investigations going on in the securities business,&quot; including insider trading.    If convicted on the one count of mail fraud, Mr. Whitfield faces a maximum five years in prison and a $1,000 fine. He is scheduled to be arraigned next Thursday in Manhattan federal court.    He left Merrill Lynch last summer.    Mr. Whitfield worked in one of Merrill's Manhattan offices from December 1980 to last August, when he resigned. A company spokesman said that no customer suffered any loss from the alleged diversion. </TEXT></DOC>
