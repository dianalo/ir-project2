Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford, the Treasury's top international policy official, made the secret trip to West Germany, Britain and France the week of Aug. 22, officials said. They said his mission was approved by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, by former Treasury Secretary James Baker, who had just left office, and by Nicholas Brady, who is awaiting Senate confirmation as his successor. It is understood that Mr. Mulford also contacted Japanese officials with the same message, although he didn't travel to Japan.    According to the officials, Mr. Mulford wasn't seeking any changes in the policies of the Group of Seven major economic powers, known as the G-7. Instead, they said, he was sent to review and confirm existing understandings and to assure the other governments that the transition at the Treasury Department won't cause the U.S. to waver in its commitments to help stabilize the dollar and coordinate its policies with those of the allies.    The timing of his trip was critical. Not only had the powerful Mr. Baker just left office to run Vice President George Bush's presidential campaign, but the Fed had just surprised financial markets by raising the U.S. discount rate. That move caused the dollar to surge and threatened to push it to levels considered too high by the Group of Seven -- which consists of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. A few days after Mr. Mulford's trip, West German interest rates were raised, helping to halt the dollar's surge.    U.S. officials say the seven governments came through that turbulent period successfully, even though they were forced to intervene heavily in currency markets to support the mark and European central banks had to raise interest rates. In general, the dollar has remained within what are believed to be the secret ranges set by the Group of Seven, at levels the governments consider low enough to help improve the U.S. trade balance but not low enough to cause economic disruption.    The seven nations' finance ministers and central bankers plan to hold a formal but routine meeting in Berlin around Sept. 22, just before the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund there.    U.S. officials say that unless a market crisis intervenes, the Berlin meeting will be merely a review of each country's economic performance and a reaffirmation of policy goals. No important policy changes are considered likely until a new U.S. president takes office next year.    There also will be at least two meetings of Group of Seven officials before the Berlin session. Mr. Mulford and other second-level officials will meet, as they do before each G-7 meeting, at an undisclosed date and place to prepare for the Berlin meeting.    In addition, a number of top economic officials are scheduled to meet in Washington Sept. 18-20 for a privately sponsored conference on international economic issues that will face the new U.S. president. Among those expected to attend are Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Mulford, West German central bank chief Karl Otto Poehl, Japan's vice finance minister, Toyoo Gyothen, and French presidential adviser Jacques Attali, according to the conference organizers, the Washington consulting firm of Smick Medley International.    If the conference goes as planned, it will also be attended by top economic advisers to Mr. Bush and to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis. </TEXT></DOC>
