Trials for the seven -- three directors of Montreal-based Memotec, two lawyers, a venture-capital businessmen and his wife -- were set for dates starting in January, according to an official of the Quebec Securities Commission.    The commission alleges that six of those charged used insider information about Memotec's planned bid for Teleglobe Canada to purchase Memotec shares and share-purchase warrants. The seventh is charged with having provided insider information to another of the accused.    Memotec, previously a small data communications and data-processing concern, was the unexpected winner in February of a bidding contest for Teleglobe, Canada's overseas telecommunications monopoly. It paid 488.3 million Canadian dollars ($370.8 million) for the concern, which was purchased from the Canadian government.    Peter Blaikie, a prominent Montreal lawyer and former president of Canada's Conservative party, will be the first to stand trial, on Jan. 18. The others will face trial between February and April. Mr. Blaikie, a senior partner with Heenan Blaikie, Memotec's legal counsel, is accused of having purchased 1,000 Memotec shares for his retirement account on Jan. 16, using illegal insider information about Memotec's planned bid. </TEXT></DOC>
