Schwartz about windmills. But if garbage is your game, he'll gladly listen.    As senior vice president, utilities and project finance group, of Prudential Capital Corp., the merchant banking unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, the 46-year-old Mr. Schwartz has a mission: to make Prudential pre-eminent in financing alternative energy.    Twelve years ago, when the stocky former high school football player joined Prudential from International Business Machines Corp., where he sold computers to electric utilities, such a goal was unimaginable. In those days, utilities financed their own plant construction. &quot;Alternative&quot; energy, while spotlighted by the rising price of oil, was too embryonic to draw private backing, and lived on government subsidies.    Then came a series of nuclear plant megabusts. State regulators vowed never again to make ratepayers foot the bill for power companies' building mistakes. There followed, too, a national garbage crisis whose only solution appears to be building plants to burn waste to make electricity and steam. All the while, alternative-energy technology steadily improved.    Today, with the need for new power plants growing, utilities are loath to commit funds. Enter Mr. Schwartz, who earned a B.A. from the University of Cincinnati in 1964 and an M.B.A. from the same school in 1970. In six years, his group has invested $1.7 billion in 58 alternative energy projects and taken equity stakes in two alternative-energy concerns.    While no numbers are kept, Prudential has one of the largest stakes in alternative energy of any U.S. investment company. Mr. Schwartz says he wouldn't be surprised if Prudential's commitment tripled, to roughly $5 billion, in five years.    A study by Edison Electric Institute, the electric-utility industry's trade group, found that as of 1986, non-utility generators accounted for 3.5% of U.S. electric generating capacity, a 10% rise from 1985.    &quot;Alternative energy is as much an alternative financing technique as it is a technology,&quot; says Mr. Schwartz. &quot;With utilities saying, 'No way in hell am I going to build another power plant,' I'm looking at {financing} big chunks of generating capacity that'll be needed 24 hours a day.&quot;    With their boss routinely delving into the nuts and bolts of prospective projects (he likes to &quot;kick the tires,&quot; says a colleague), Mr. Schwartz's team of 20 people spends roughly two-thirds of their time analyzing alternative proposals. Only one in 10 worthwhile proposals wins Prudential's backing.    Mr. Schwartz looks for at least a 25% or better return on equity, or a return on debt of at least 1.5% to 1.75% over the rate of 10-year to 15-year Treasury bonds. Consulting engineers advise on technological feasibility, and Mr. Schwartz researches whether a project may face local opposition. &quot;The returns are high because the risks can be high,&quot; he says.    Why no windmills? Because Prudential was burned investing in three giant wind plants in California. &quot;The wind didn't blow,&quot; Mr. Schwartz growls, and the plants' machinery was unreliable.    Nor is Mr. Schwartz high on solar power despite recent technological breakthroughs and growing concern about pollution from burning coal and oil. For Mr. Schwartz, the sun doesn't shine long enough in most parts of the U.S. to make solar a good source of bulk power.    He believes in garbage-burning. Prudential has a 21% equity stake in Kuhr Technologies Inc., a Guttenberg, N.J.based company that builds waste-to-energy plants using refuse-derived-fuel, or RDF, technology. With RDF plants, recyclable garbage such as paper and aluminum are sorted before burning and sold.    (The alternative waste-to-energy technology, called mass burn, has no pre-sorting. Mass-burn plants are thus generally cheaper to operate, but financial returns usually aren't as good.)    Mr. Schwartz says waste-to-energy has the &quot;greatest potential&quot; of any alternative energy source. He adds that whether that potential is ever fully realized will depend on whether people can be convinced that garbage-burning isn't a health hazard.    Mr. Schwartz also likes gas-fired cogeneration plants. Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity and steam heat from a single fuel source such as natural gas. More efficient than traditional power plants, cogeneration plants represent an &quot;exciting opportunity,&quot; he says.    As well as financing several cogeneration projects, Prudential has sunk $3 million into a company that builds gas-fired cogeneration facilities. Mr. Schwartz won't identify the company, which he expects to have assets of $200 million by 1995, compared with just $7 million today.    For its investment, Prudential acquired a 65% share of the company. Mr. Schwartz says there are many &quot;nascent&quot; IPPs, short for independent power producers, which he expects will become giant and very profitable in a few years.    Mr. Schwartz wouldn't be surprised if, before long, someone creates an open-end mutual fund investing in alternative-energy firms. Several IPPs, he reiterates, are going to become &quot;very big.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
