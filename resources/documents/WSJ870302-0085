The sale of about $725 million of stock is expected to bring the state's $7.6 billion fund about $280 million of capital gains, Dave Rose, the fund's executive director, said.    Alaska voters created the permanent fund in 1976 as a means of saving, investing and distributing some of the state's oil wealth. About 10% of Alaska's oil revenue goes to the fund, which makes an annual distribution to state residents based on its earnings. Last year, residents received $556 each.    The portfolio sale began Thursday, when $132 million of stock was sold, and is due to continue through March 11. It is being handled by Bankers Trust Co., which manages the portion of the fund's portfolio that is linked to the Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. 500-stock index. Proceeds are being reinvested in intermediate and long-term debt securities, Mr. Rose said.    In a memorandum to the fund's board of trustees, Mr. Rose argued that stocks in general are overvalued after years of a steadily rising market. Stock prices are high relative to corporate earnings, he said in urging trustees to protect the fund's principal by taking profits now.    Under the state constitution, the fund's principal must be invested, not spent. However, investment earnings may be appropriated by the Legislature.    The sale is expected to about double the fund's earnings pool to around $550 million. Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper and some legislators would like to use that money to bolster state spending and avoid major budget cuts or tax increases.    The state projects an $875 million budget deficit for the current fiscal year, ending June 30, and revenue is expected to decline next year. About 70% of Alaska's revenue comes from oil royalties and taxes, and falling oil prices have seriously depressed its income.    Mr. Rose denied, however, that the stock sale was initiated to provide funds for state spending. </TEXT></DOC>
