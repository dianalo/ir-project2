The House blocked an effort Tuesday to require aliens to beexcluded from the census numbers used in House reapportionmentevery decade. But the question still may be raised in committee andin the Senate.   The national head count will be taken April 1, 1990. Censusfigures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among thestates every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to localgovernments.   The reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of Housemembers from states where slow growth threatens to result in lossesof House seats. Most of these states are in the North, where growthhas lagged behind that of the South and West.   Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, Westand industrial states like New York, and other states fear a lossof power to those areas if the aliens are counted.   While aliens have been counted in the past, military personnelstationed overseas have not.   The Commerce Department settled that problem by announcing itwill work with the Defense Department on ways to count the 1.2million to 1.6 million military and civilian defense workers wholive overseas.   The problem has been in deciding which states may count thesepeople as residents. That has yet to be decided, but possibilitiesinclude counting the state where the person owns a home or the laststate where he or she lived for at least six months.   The battle over illegal aliens, meanwhile, was taken up both incommittee and on the House floor.   Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban oncounting aliens to an appropriations measure providing $5.8 millionto run the State, Justice and Commerce departments next year,including $800 million to take the census. The bill was approved258-165 and sent to the Senate.   Opponents noted the Constitution requires House seats to beapportioned based on all the ``persons'' residing in a state.   ``Every census since the Constitution was created has countedall residents of the states, both citizens and non-citizens,''observed Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.   ``Congress is empowered to identify those to be counted'' in thecensus, responded Ridge. The Census Bureau's $4 billion budget forthe census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegalaliens, he said.   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., charged the debate is really overpopulation shifts that will lead to more House seats for southernand western states.   ``Pennsylvania, I don't care what they do, unless they go downto the Southwest and bring the people back, they're going to lose aseat,'' said Dymally.   Rep. Tim Valentine, D-N.C., said, however, that counting illegalaliens ``is not fair. It may be constitutional, but it's just notright.''   Census officials generally have opposed any attempt to deleteillegal aliens, contending they cannot determine who is in thecountry legally. Asking people about their status likely wouldresult in people lying or refusing to participate in the count,officials say, resulting in a potential undercount of residents inmany areas.</TEXT></DOC>
