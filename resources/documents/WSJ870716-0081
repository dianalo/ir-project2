Pentagon officials assert that the Chicago-based defense contractor has employed poor production procedures that have delayed deliveries. In addition, some of the motors delivered have been defective, the Air Force charged.    Normally, the Air Force pays the company $10 million a month for its rocket-motor work. The service said it plans to suspend 10% of that payment until the work on the rocket system improves.    Despite the problems, rocket motors on the MX missiles that have been deployed are reliable, Air Force officials said. Continued defects and delays could jeopardize the Air Force's deployment schedule, however, they said.    The Air Force also described as reliable the current inventory of MX missiles, based on successful test firings.    Thomas S. Russell, vice president of corporate development and strategic planning for Morton Thiokol, responded, &quot;As far as we know, we have taken the necessary corrective action, but the Air Force plans to withhold progress payments until enough time has passed for them to see the results of the corrective actions we've taken.&quot;    Mr. Russell said the company hasn't delivered any motors that were defective, contrary to the charge of the Air Force; he said rather that the Air Force had raised questions about the production process.    Mr. Russell said also the Air Force had indicated it is satisfied with the corrective actions the company has taken.    Thiokol also makes specialty chemicals and salt.    The Air Force last spring said it withheld some payments from Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp., another defense contractor, because of delays in delivering guidance equipment for the missile.    In addition, the Air Force and the House Armed Services Committee are investigating allegations by current and former Northrop employees that some components haven't been tested fully, and that the company overcharged the service by more than $14 million.    Northrop officials have said that they were examining an audit to determine if any overcharges were made. Northrop officials also have maintained the company's MX equipment isn't faulty despite assertions by some employees. </TEXT></DOC>
