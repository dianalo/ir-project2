Ketly Biamby, mother of ex-Presidential Guard commander Col.Philippe Biamby, began her fast Monday, the independent daily LeMatin reported.   Mrs. Biamby told the newspaper her son and two other leaders ofthe coup attempt, who also have been on hunger strikes, ``havecommitted no infringement of American law and have been jailedillegally.''   In an interview with privately owned Tele-Haiti Monday night, sheaccused U.S. immigration authorities of jailing her son and Col.Himmler Rebu and Lt. Col. Leonce Qualo in New York and refusing toreview their case.   The three were expelled from Haiti to the neighboring DominicanRepublic on April 3 after troops loyal to Haitian ruler Lt. Gen.Prosper Avril foiled their attempted coup the day before.   They flew to Miami two days later and asked for political asylum.They have remained jailed in the U.S. Immigration Service DetentionFacility in New York pending review of their request.   The U.S. Embassy has said the three are not under indictment andare free to leave the United States when they want to.   ``All they have to do is withdraw their (political asylum) demandand they are free to go,'' U.S. Embassy Spokeswoman Susan Clyde saidTuesday.   Mrs. Biamby denied the U.S. Embassy claim that the three canleave. She said their passports had been confiscated, preventingtheir departure.   Biamby, 36, Rebu, 38, and Qualo, 35, began a hunger strike June26 to protest their detention. Mrs. Biamby said her son washospitalized July 13 and was refusing transfusions.   Charles Troy, spokesman for the New York District office of theImmigration and Naturalization Service, said the three are in amedical unit at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.   ``Those three gentlemen are not accepting solid food. They havebeen seen taking fluid, including juice and water,'' he said.   ``They are under constant medical treatment in the medical unitof the facility. Their vital signs are constantly being monitored.Doctors are on the case.''   On the passport and asylum issues, Troy said the INS position isthe same as that of the State Department _ their passports would bereturned if they withdraw their asylum application. ``If they don'twish to go back to Haiti, we will assist them _ so there's noproblem there,'' said Troy.   ``They applied for asylum and were interviewed by our officers.We got a State Department advisory back that said they weren't beingpersecuted down there in Haiti,'' he added.   ``So we issued them a notice of intent to deny their application.By regulation they could submit a rebuttal and they did so. Allthree have retained counsel.   ``Their rebuttal was forwarded to the Department of State for itsadvisory opinion. That's where the case rests now.''   After the State Department delivers its opinon the INS will makea final decision, according to Troy. He said he did not know howlong that might take.   Mrs. Biamby's ``declarations have provoked a wave of emotion andindignation in all Haitian families,'' conservative politicianHubert De Ronceray said Tuesday.   Avril claimed the coup attempt and a rebellion the following weekby two units, also crushed by loyalists, was financed by supportersof former dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, who fled into exile inFrance in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
