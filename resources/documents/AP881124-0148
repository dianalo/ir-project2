The protest organizer, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said they were chanting slogans atWestminster Bridge, next to Parliament, when police moved in.   ``More than 20 police horses and at least 100 policemen on footjust charged a crowd of people indiscriminately. The horses wentamong the crowd and pushed people up against walls,'' he said.
