Flynn said addicts, their sex partners and their babies ``arethe fastest growing group of AIDS victims,'' and that conventionalanti-drug measures ``do not go far enough in the short term'' tocurb the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.   Dr. George A. Lamb, the city's director of clinical andcommunity health services, was prepared to outline the proposedprogram at a closed meeting this morning at City Hall, according toThe Boston Globe. He recently toured several European cities toexamine needle distribution programs.   Addicts could enter the program on their own or by referral,Lamb said.   Flynn is seeking approval by the City Council of a home rulepetition to the Legislature, the newspaper said. The move wouldbypass any applicable state laws against possession of hypodermicsyringes by drug addicts or against dispensing such equipment todrug addicts.   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis has opposed any needle exchange program,as had state Public Health Commissioner Deborah Prothrow-Stith.   The Globe quoted Prothrow-Stith as suggesting Monday night thatif the state wanted to consider ``something really radical,'' itcould supply addicts not only with sterile needles but also withheroin.   But Department of Public Health spokesman John Stobierski saidtoday the comment ``was in no way a policy recommendation orproposal,'' but was made by the commissioner in explaining why shebelieved the needle exchange proposal was ``very, very wrong.''   In a statement today, Prothrow-Stith said the department remainsopposed to a needle exchange for IV drug users'' and that the stateshould continue to concentrate on drug treatment and rehabilitationprograms.   A proposal by New York City to supply a small number of addictswith clean needles on an experimental basis awaits formal approvalfrom the state health commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, who hadopposed the idea but said last month that he would approve it.   New York wants to supply 200 to 400 addicts with syringes. Therecipients would have to turn in used needles to get fresh ones.The needles would be tested for AIDS and to ensure that theyweren't shared.   Although the test period would last a year, the city's healthcommissioner, Dr. Stephen Joseph, has said he expected solidindications of success or failure within six months.   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spreadthrough sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to theiroffspring.</TEXT></DOC>
