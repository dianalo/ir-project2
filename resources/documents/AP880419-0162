The missiles flew from Iran's anti-ship missile batteries Mondayas the Navy attacked two Iranian oil platforms in the southernPersian Gulf in retaliation for a mine that blew a hole in a U.S.frigate last week.   Officers on the Williams, which led the ``surface actiongroup,'' identified the missiles as Chinese-built Silkworms but thePentagon and Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff, did not confirm it. The Pentagon said Tuesday it was stillanalyzing the attack.   With the first warning of ``Silkworm incoming!'' the JackWilliams lurched into violent maneuvers and crewmen scrambled.   ``Everybody look astern! Everybody look astern!'' Lt. AugustinoPonturier, officer of the deck, shouted to junior officers andlookouts.   The guided missile frigate rolled sharply and pointed its sterntoward the approaching missile, presenting its smallest target andallowing the aluminum-chaff launchers and other defensive weapons aclear shot.   None of the first four rockets came close enough to be seen butmembers of a helicopter crew and a fire detail hit the deck as thefifth crossed behind the ship and slammed into a distant oil rigwith an orange-yellow flash.   Officers aboard the ship were elated with the response system.   ``Not one of these ladies has a scratch on her, and the otherguys can't say that,'' said Capt. Don Dyer, operational commanderof the force.   In all, six Iranian ships were damaged by U.S. fire Monday.   Dyer said a C-130 aircraft spotting targets for the Iranianbatteries was tracked by U.S. jets from the nuclear-poweredaircraft carrier Enterprise and was almost shot down.   U.S. officials reported one U.S. helicopter with two crewmembers aboard missing Monday, and the search continued Tuesday.They denied Iranian claims that the aircraft was shot down.   The Williams, with members of a Pentagon news media pool aboard,was the operational flagship for one of the three ``surface actiongroups'' involved in the fighting Monday in the southern gulf. Alsoin the group were the destroyers Joseph Strauss and O'Brien.   Monday's operations began when U.S. warships destroyed twoIranian oil platforms.   Over the next few hours, Navy forces sank two missile-armedpatrol boats, damaged two others and bombed and rocketed twofrigates.   One of the Iranian frigates, the Sahand, was hit by a Harpoonmissile fired from the Strauss.   The white missile roared skyward in a cloud of smoke andstreaked for the horizon. The men on the Williams' bridge cheered:``Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!''   A flash and white smoke erupted on the horizon, followed by along series of heavy explosions as the weapons and ammunitionaboard the Sahand blew up.   Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke, a spokesman for the Navy's Joint TaskForce Middle East, said a U.S. pilot who observed the Sahandreported it ``listing badly, with a big hole in its port side, thesuperstructure on fire and a lifeboat with some survivors in thewater.''   Soon afterward, F-14 jet fighters from the Enterprise attackedthe Sahand's sister frigate Sabalan after it fired a missile atthem.   U.S. Army Maj. Barry Willey, a Central Command officeraccompanying the media pool, described the view from the Williamsbridge as ``both spectacular and frightening _ contrails frommissiles could be seen in almost every direction.''   The oil platform attacks were aimed at what U.S. officialscalled military targets. Both the Sassan and Sirri-D platforms havebeen used by for military purposes, they say.   President Reagan ordered the strikes after the frigate Samuel B.Roberts hit a mine, which U.S. officials say was laid by Iran, inthe central gulf last Thursday. Ten crewman were wounded.   While other groups attacked the platforms, the Williams' unitsteamed halfway through the Strait or Hormuz, in calm seas, underclear skies within range of Iranian Silkworm batteries that had notyet been used in the southern gulf.   Van Dyke said the mission was to ``exercise the right ofinnocent transit passage and respond to all contingencies.''   That's when the missiles came.   As the Williams and its accompanying warships sailed out of the``Silkworm envelope'' later Monday, into safer waters and a settingsun, the alert level was lowered from ``general quarters'' to thenext lowest ``condition one-alpha.''   Ponturier, of Red Bank, N.J., took off his steel helmet andwalked toward the door. ``It's Miller time,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
