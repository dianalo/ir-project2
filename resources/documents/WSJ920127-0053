Administration and industry officials said the newstrategy isn't intended to stop purchases of mosttop-priority weapons already in the pipeline, including theF-22 advanced jet fighter being built for the Air Force by ateam led by Lockheed Corp.; McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s C-17cargo plane and the company's advanced version of the F/A-18fighter, or the Army's LH helicopter produced by Boeing Co.and United Technologies Corp.</LP><TEXT>   Other programs equally far along, such as the Navy'sArleigh Burke destroyers, are likely to survive, thoughproduction rates and the eventual purchases are certain toshrink because of budget pressures.   But eventually, Mr. Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheneyenvision a major overhaul that will keep many researchprograms from ever moving into full-bore production. Insteadof assuring industry at the start of a major research effortthat the Pentagon ultimately plans a hefty production run,contractors frequently will be forced to turn out onlyprototypes or remain in low-rate production indefinitely.   The thrust of the Bush initiative was first reported bythe Los Angeles Times. Although the plan is expected to fallshort of that and other news reports last week predicting avirtual, open-ended freeze on weapons production, both thePentagon and its largest suppliers acknowledged that the planultimately could redefine how they have done business fordecades.   Research contracts will be stretched out, further delayingdecisions on various production options. And defensecompanies, no longer able to rely on manufacturing profits tounderwrite early development losses, will have to become morenimble to survive, partly by learning how to keep theirsupplier base and work force intact despite limitedproduction.   Such a transition poses immense challenges, requiringunprecedented discipline from the military and Congress insticking with budget priorities. Changing production-ratesmidstream often forces companies to &quot;redesign the whole damnthing,&quot; warned Peter Oram, the president of Grumman Corp.'saircraft division.   The government also will have to encourage new technologyby providing an opportunity for profits early in thedevelopment cycle. Many industry officials expressed concernsabout the Pentagon's long-term plan, which is expected to beunveiled tomorrow during Mr. Bush's State of the Union speechand then spelled out in detail later in Pentagon budgetdocuments.   &quot;Prototypes for prototypes' sake will just produce a lotof museum pieces,&quot; said Daniel Tellep, Lockheed's chairman,echoing industry fears that the focus on research could gotoo far. What makes more sense, he said, is to produceprototypes that actually can be used on the battlefield in acrisis. And if industry and the Pentagon can agree up fronton a low but steady production rate, Mr. Tellep believesefficient manufacturing still is possible.   But many other industry leaders are less optimistic,arguing that the plan simply fails to recognize thedifficulty and the time required to ramp up production. &quot;I'mastounded by the lack of in-depth understanding in thePentagon about what it takes to preserve the industrialbase,&quot; said Alan Chase, head of the Washington office ofGeneral Dynamics Corp.   In some ways, Mr. Bush's policy shift reflects -- andofficially locks in -- some of the changes already bubblinginside the Pentagon. The go-slow approach toward production,for instance, is expected to be used in part to justifyprevious administration decisions to seek a halt inproduction of the B-2 Stealth bomber and nuclear-poweredSeawolf attack submarine.   Some of the deepest cuts in Mr. Bush's budget are reservedfor long-range nuclear weapons. As expected, the Pentagonwants to halt production of additional warheads forsubmarine-launched Trident II missiles at the EnergyDepartment's troubled Rocky Flats plant near Denver. And Mr.Bush, as he did last year before the Soviet Union brokeapart, will propose other steps to reduce the overall numberof U.S. ballistic missiles carrying multiple-warheads.   Cancellation of the Trident II warhead would, in effect,formally end production of all new U.S. nuclear warheads forthe first time in decades. Making plutonium triggers for theTrident II has been the only nuclear production workscheduled at Rocky Flats, which has been shut down for safetyand other repairs since November 1989. Energy Secretary JamesWatkins recently announced plans to move Rocky Flat'snon-nuclear production to Kansas City. But cleanup andenvironmental restoration work will continue at Rocky Flatsand other former weapons-production facilities for years tocome. And the department still plans to reopen a laboratorybuilding at Rocky Flats later this year.   ---   Rose Gutfeld in Washington contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
