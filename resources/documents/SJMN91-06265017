Nor are they very enthusiastic about theEuropean ideal.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  POLL: REBELLION IS OUT, MAKING MONEY IS IN AMONGEUROPE'S YOUTHS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     These are some of the findings that surprised the authors of an exhaustivesurvey of social change in Western Europe.;   Two years in preparation,&quot;Frontiers: Planning for Consumer Change in Europe,&quot; involved interviews with7,000 Europeans. It will be published next week for corporate clients byResearch International and the Henley Center for Forecasting.;   The image ofa non-radical and distinctly avaricious youth emerged at an early stage of thesurvey.;   &quot;Perhaps folk memories of the '60s have left us with expectationsthat young people will naturally be radical, dissatisfied and hungry forsocial change,&quot; says James Murphy, associate editor of &quot;Frontiers.&quot; &quot;But thesedays are gone. Western Europeans from 16 to 24 no longer see it as theircultural responsibility to challenge the economic principles of the societythat they inhabit.&quot;;   &quot;Earning more money&quot; is a particularly importantpersonal goal for 60 percent of young people in Britain and Germany. Only 21percent of young Britons said that &quot;getting more free time&quot; was as important.And if they want more money, they most certainly do not want to pay more taxesto finance more social spending -- even on health.;   Many left-wing ideasseem to be in eclipse among young people. To the youth of Spain, &quot;freedom&quot; isnow a significantly more important personal value than &quot;equality.&quot;;   Frenchyoungsters thought pop singer Sting was a better symbol of rebellion than CheGuevara, Fidel Castro's late guerrilla comrade.;   When the researchers askedEuropeans if they thought multinational companies cared selfishly andexclusively about their own interests, they found that in France, Italy andBritain, young people were much more willing than their elders to give themultinationals the benefit of the doubt. In France and Italy, fewer than halfthe young respondents said they thought the multinationals were selfish.;  Conservative attitudes among the young are mirrored by home and family life.Almost 60 percent of all 16- to 24-year-olds in Britain are still living athome; in the Netherlands, it is 70 percent; and in Italy, virtually everyone-- 95 percent -- lives at home until age 25.;   There is no surging sharedenthusiasm among Europe's young for the forging of a European personality.Except in Britain, Europeans age 16 to 25 were generally less inclined thantheir elders to abolish border controls between member states of the EuropeanCommunity.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  London Observer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  London  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910921  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  457  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday, September 21, 199100265017,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
