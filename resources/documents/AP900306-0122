ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Not to be outdone by McDonald's, Time WarnerInc. announced plans Tuesday to open American-style,multiple-screen movie theaters next year in Moscow and Leningrad,where audiences will be allowed to eat popcorn in their seats forthe first time.   The two ultramodern theaters are expected to open in late 1991at a cost of $28 million, and will offer the Soviet Union's avidmoviegoers a total of 19 new screens and 7,400 new seats to enjoypopular foreign and domestic films, U.S. and Soviet officials said.   The theaters will feature state-of-the-art projection and Dolbystereo sound systems, computerized ticket booths, concession standsin marble and neon lobbies, restaurants, souvenir shops and videogame arcades _ with parking lots out front.   American popcorn, a novelty to Soviet audiences, will be soldalong with candy and soft drinks. And in a break with Soviettradition, moviegoers who formerly were required to consumerefreshments at buffet counters in theater lobbies will be able tocarry them to their seats in the new theaters.   ``Hooray for Hollywood and Leningrad and Moscow, too,'' saidTime Warner President N.J. Nicholas Jr. at a news conference at theSoviet Embassy where Ambassador Yuri Dubinin toasted ``the healthyfuture of this Soviet-American child.''   The project is a joint venture between Time Warner, a worldwidepublishing and entertainment conglomerate whose Warner Bros.International Theaters Co. subsidiary will own 60 percent of thetheaters, and the official Soviet film agency, v@o Sovexportfilm,which will own 40 percent.   The announcement came less than two months after McDonald'sopened its first fast-food restaurant in the Soviet capital Jan.31, serving an opening-day record of 30,000 meals to hungryMuscovites.   Plans for the two new theaters doubtless will be good news toSoviet moviegoers, who see an average of 14 films a year comparedto the four seen by their American counterparts, according toindustry estimates.   ``They'll have every auditorium completely filled every hour ofthe day,'' predicted Jack Valenti, president of the Motion PictureAssociation of America.   The largest of Moscow's more than 100 movie theaters, the RussiaTheater, contains a 1,200-seat auditorium for feature films and a500-seat room for documentaries.   By contrast, the new Warner multiplex in the Soviet capital willboast 10 screens and 4,000 seats. It will be built on NovokirovskyProspekt near a major railroad and subway terminal. The Leningradtheater, also near a subway station, will have nine screens and3,400 seats.   Oleg A. Rudnev, the jowly, bushy-browed general director of theSoviet film agency, said the new theaters will be free to showpotentially controversial American movies such as ``The Hunt forRed October,'' the newly released, pre-glasnost tale of a Sovietsubmarine commander who defects to the United States.   ``There is no censorship anymore,'' Rudnev said through aninterpreter. ``It is probably not possible to surprise the Sovietviewer any longer.''   Time Warner officials said ticket prices won't be decided untilAmerican films are test-marketed in Moscow and Leningrad todetermine what Soviet viewers are willing to pay.   Embassy officials said movie tickets in Moscow average about 50kopeks, or eight cents, under the unofficial exchange rate forforeign visitors. Prices are cheaper for matinees and more costly _about 25 cents _ for lengthy, popular feature films in moreluxurious theaters.</TEXT></DOC>
