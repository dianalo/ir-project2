Environmental parametersaffecting natural gamma ray, resistivity, and neutron porosity measurementswhile drilling (MWD) include borehole size, invasion, drilling rate,and formation exposure time, MWD logs, in many cases, can provide superiorquality data as compared with comparable wireline sensors.</TEXT></DOC>
