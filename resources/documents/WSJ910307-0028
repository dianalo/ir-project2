The decision by a Washington appeals court to blockGenetics Institute from selling its version of an anti-anemiadrug in the U.S. sent the company's stock sprawling, as itsshares dropped 35%. At one point during the day, GeneticsInstitute shares were off more than 50%. Meanwhile, withAmgen's role as the leader of the U.S. biotechnology industrysecured, its stock soared about 12%.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling was a knock-out punch that even Amgen's mostoptimistic followers hadn't forecast. It &quot;vindicates ourposition completely,&quot; said Gordon Binder, chairman and chiefexecutive officer of the 11-year-old drug maker. The ruling,he added, is a boon for the entire biotech industry becauseit &quot;will stimulate original research and development.&quot;   But it was a serious setback for Genetics Institute, whoseversion of the drug erythropoietin has been blocked from theU.S. market for nearly two years, largely because of thepatent dispute. Sales of Amgen's version of the drug,launched in June 1989, are expected to reach $350 million inthe current fiscal year.   Genetics Institute, based in Cambridge, Mass., said it is&quot;very disappointed&quot; by the ruling, which partly reversed alower court decision. In a brief statement, the company saidit needs more time to analyze the order before deciding whatto do next.   But analysts said it is unlikely that Genetics Institute'sversion of EPO will ever be sold in the U.S. because the U.S.Supreme Court in recent years has rarely consented to reviewpatent cases. The decision therefore appears to give Amgen,Thousand Oaks, Calif., a legal monopoly over domestic EPOsales to kidney dialysis patients. It also helps Amgen'spartner, Johnson andamp; Johnson, which has other rights to thedrug.   In national over-the-counter trading, Genetics Institute'sstock plummeted $21.75 to close at $40.25; Amgen's shares,which soared as much as $20 after the decision was announced,closed up $12 at $113. In New York Stock Exchange compositetrading, Johnson andamp; Johnson shares jumped $4.25 to close at$87.625 while shares of Upjohn, Genetics Institute'smarketing partner, fell $3.125 to close at $41.875.   Analysts had expected the appeals court basically tovalidate a Massachusetts district court ruling that upheldthe patents of both Amgen and Genetics Institute, and whichfound that the companies were infringing each others'patents. An agreement to cross-license sales was seen as themost likely way to resolve the stalemate.   Instead, the appeals court ruled that Genetic'sInstitute's patent was invalid because it failed to show howto make EPO with the claimed degree of purity. GeneticsInstitute's patent covered a purified form of EPO. The courtupheld Amgen's claim to the technology necessary to producerecombinant EPO.   The ruling was a double whammy for Genetics Institute. Thecompany had been counting on revenue both from royalties onU.S. sales and from manufacturing the drug in the U.S. forEuropean sales. Genetics Institute conceded that the decisionmeans that manufacturing its EPO in the U.S. infringesAmgen's patent.   Genetics Institute has licensed marketing rights for itsEPO in the U.S. to Chugai-Upjohn Inc., a joint venture ofChugai Pharmaceutical Co., Japan, and Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo,Mich. Johnson andamp; Johnson holds U.S. rights to Amgen's versionof EPO for all applications except treatment of kidneydialysis patients. Amgen retained that market for itselfunder a 1985 agreement with Jandamp;J.   The decision &quot;really knocks the legs out from under{Genetics Institute's} near-term prospects,&quot; said LindaMiller, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. &quot;They'll rebound,but this could do quite a bit of damage to their corporatepsyche and morale.&quot;   For Amgen, coming off approval two weeks ago for itssecond new drug, Neupogen, the news could hardly have beenbetter. Amgen learned late Tuesday that a decision had beenreached, but couldn't find out what it was. Officials huddledaround a fax machine early yesterday as pages of the documenttrickled in from a Washington law firm.   &quot;Eventually folks will get back to work around here,&quot;quipped company spokesman Mark Brand. Especially jubilant are&quot;the chemists, attorneys and others who devoted the bulk ofthe last several years of their lives to EPO,&quot; he said. Thecompany has spent more than $10 million in legal feesfighting Genetics Institute.   Analysts had criticized Amgen for stubbornly refusing to across-licensing agreement with Genetics Institute. Anddespite Amgen's apparent victory, some analysts think thelasting message will be that it is better to compromise thanfight. &quot;More companies will want to cross-license because ithas been such a long, expensive battle,&quot; said Denise Gilbert,an analyst at County NatWest Securities USA.   Many analysts were busy revising upwards their Amgenprofit and sales estimates. Stuart Weisbrod at Merrill LynchInc. increased his fiscal 1992 per-share profit estimates to$3.10 from $2.70, on sales of $582 million. Based on hisforecasts, Amgen sales in the year ending March 1992 wouldsurpass those of another biotech concern, Genentech Inc. Heexpects Genentech to post sales of about $527 million incalendar year 1991.   Despite its setback, Genetics Institute still has aportfolio of potentially lucrative products in thedevelopment stage, analysts said. Among them are &quot;bone-growthfactors&quot; to promote healing of broken bones and treat otherdiseases. Robert Kupor, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody andamp;Co., said that the court ruling prompted him to lower hisestimates of Genetics Institute's 1991 earnings to eightcents from 44 cents a share and its 1992 earnings to 30 centsfrom $1.30 a share.</TEXT></DOC>
