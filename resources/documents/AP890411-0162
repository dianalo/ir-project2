It also urged the United States to lift the trade embargoagainst Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government and called on theBush administration to open talks with Nicaraguan leaders.   Copies of the letter were released to journalists Tuesday byPresident Daniel Ortega's press office. An aide said the letterwould be published in other countries.   Among the signatories were Cuban dancer Alicia Alonso, Spanishpoet Rafael Alberti, American actor Ed Asner, Italian film directorBernardo Bertolucci, Brazilian composer Chico Buarque de Holandoand American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein.   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater was askedabout the letter, and he said: ``We want to continue to watch thesituation in Nicaragua, to keep the pressure on the Sandinistas forchange, to keep the pressure on them to live up to their promises.We think there should be discussion between the parties involved.''   He also said Secretary of State James A. Baker III has raisedthe possibility of incentives to the Sandinistas if they makereform efforts but added, ``We wouldn't want to speculate on whatthat would be.''   There have been reports in Washington of a possible easing ofthe trade sanctions.   The letter said the Central American nations should be allowedto ``resolve on their own their own affairs, without any foreigninterference,'' and peace in Nicaragua ``must immediately bere-established.''   It said outside countries must support the accords reached bythe five Central American presidents Feb. 14 in El Salvador.   The letter told Bush, ``This is the moment for you to restoredirect dialogue with Nicaragua.''   There was no immediate response by Ortega to the letter.   At the February summit Ortega promised to institute democraticreforms and to hold elections in February 1990, 10 months earlierthan planned.   In March his government freed nearly 2,000 former nationalguardsmen imprisoned since the Sandinistas won a civil war againstthe right-wing regime of President Anastasio Somoza in 1979.   Ortega and the presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Ricaand Honduras also agreed at the Februar meeting to produce bymid-May a plan for dismantling the force of Nicaraguan rebels knownas Contras.   An estimated 11,000 Contras have been living in border camps inHonduras since the U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the rebelsin February 1988.   Ortega has criticized the Bush administration's proposal toprovide up to $45 million in humanitarian aid to the Contras over10 months.</TEXT></DOC>
