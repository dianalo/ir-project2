Diplomats in Rangoon said protesters rallied in front of RangoonGeneral Hospital, a gathering spot for demonstrators after securityforces allegedly shot doctors and nurses there during last week'srioting.   Japan's Kyodo news service, reporting from Rangoon, citedreports of an orderly demonstration of nearly 10,000 people inMandalay, the country's second-largest city. The report, whichcould not be independently confirmed, said protesters includeduniformed doctors and nurses.   Diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said securityforces made no effort to interfere with the rally in Rangoon.During last week's disturbances, security forces repeatedly firedon protesters who refused to disperse and many people were killed.   State-run Radio Rangoon says at least 95 people were killed and240 wounded last week in the largest demonstrations since Burmabecame independent from Britain in 1948. Western diplomats say theybelieve hundreds were killed but say they have no evidence.   Diplomats said 3,000 to 5,000 protesters today held up placardsand listened to speeches by students leading a campaign to endauthoritarian rule after the resignation Friday of hard-linePresident Sein Lwin. In recent days students have distributedleaflets and pasted posters throughout the city calling for moredemonstrations.   A Western diplomat said protesters and monks also held aBuddhist memorial service in front of the hospital for those whodied last week.   ``It seems to be a kind of stationary rally, with no marching,''he said. He said it began in the late morning and continued intothe late afternoon.   A Western diplomat said about 1,000 people held a similar rallyin front of the hospital on Tuesday and passed out leafletsdemanding the dismantling of the Burma Socialist Program Party.   Sein Lwin resigned as state president and party chairman afteronly 17 days in power. He had replaced Ne Win, whose 1962 militarycoup ended democracy in Burma and instituted one-party rule.   The party and the legislature scheduled emergency sessions forFriday, presumably to choose a new leadership.   One senior Western diplomat today reported rumors of dissensionwithin the military and said a coup was possible if army commandersfeel the leadership changes do not meet popular calls for reform.   During last week's rioting, security forces in at least twotowns reportedly sided with demonstrators.   The brutal handling of the riots put the government undermounting pressure for radical change. Kyodo said a group of formerpoliticians including former Prime Minister Nu issued a statementtoday calling for creation of a people's ``national interimcommittee'' to serve as caretaker government and end the crisis.   The statement said security forces killed many innocent people.It said the government has lost control and warned of morebloodshed if the government continues its present policies.   A Western diplomat said the daughter of late Burmeseindependence leader Aung San issued a statement in Rangoon todaycalling for multi-party rule. The statement was addressed to KyawHtin, the No. 3 government official as secretary of the StateCouncil.   The statement called for creation of a ``people's consultativecommittee'' to form a caretaker government that would oversee atransition to multi-party rule.   The daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, is visiting her mother inRangoon, the diplomat said. He said she lives in Cambridge,England, with her British husband, a university professor.   In an extraordinary rebuke, the Rangoon Lawyers' Council onTuesday lodged an unprecedented formal protest with the governmentover security forces' firing on peaceful protesters.   The council is under the government's Council of People'sAttorneys.   ``Some people were shot in a hospital, inside their houses, andat a tea shop. It was ... a violation of human rights,'' said theletter, signed by 177 lawyers.   ``Shooting at demonstrators from behind in some areas was asheer violation of the U.N. declaration of human rights,'' it said.   It said the dead were buried without their families beingnotified and that thousands of people were arrested.   The letter demanded multiparty rule, lifting of the state ofemergency in Rangoon and other cities, release of those detained,immediate halt to use of force by security personnel, anindependent investigation into the shootings, and disclosure ofinformation on casualties.   A text was obtained from one of the foreign embassies thatreceived copies of the letter.   ``It's considered significant in that many prominent people havesigned it,'' a Western diplomat in Rangoon said today.</TEXT></DOC>
