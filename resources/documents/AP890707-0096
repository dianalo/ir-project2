No pickup.</HEAD><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Communist Party newspaper reactedangrily to remarks by West Germany's finance minister that Germanyshould be reunified within its 1937 borders, which include about athird of Poland.   Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in Hanover on Sunday that theGerman Reich in its borders of 1937 did not cease to exist with theGerman army's 1945 capitulation to the Allies.   Waigel said his party, the Christian Social Union, would neverallow the demand for reunification of the two Germanies to bestricken from the West German Constitution.   If the old German borders were recognized, Poland would lose someof its largest cities, such as Wroclaw and Szczecin, and its biggestindustrial region in southeastern Silesia.   ``Questioning at a revisionist rally the map of postwar Europeand the irreversible character of the border on the Odra and Nysarivers, Minister Waigel, as a government representative, strikes atour fundamental national and state rationale,'' said the editorialin the Polish Communist Party's Trybuna Ludu on Thursday.   ``Such a line .... is unacceptable for the Polish nation and forall Poles regardless of their political orientation.''   Although West Germany has been the most active Western country inpromoting relations with the communist countries of Central and EastEurope, Polish-West German relations have been strained by a host ofbilateral issues.   West Germany wants better treatment for the German minority thatremained in the former German territories after World War II, andthere is resentment toward the flood of Polish emigrants or illegalworkers who have taken advantage of liberalized passport laws totravel to West Germany.   Poland has accused West Germany of insensitivity to itssovereignty because of the calls by rightist politicians for oldGerman territories and because of West Germany's refusal to granteconomic assistance unless Poland makes concessions on theminorities issue.   In Bonn today, a leading Solidarity official urged Polishreconciliation with West Germany but said his country should notgive up any land.   ``Those who question existing borders damage perspectives forstability in Europe,'' said Bronislaw Geremek, leader ofSolidarity's deputies in the Polish parliament.   Geremek also said he sees ``new chances for (closer) relationsbetween Germans and Poles,'' and that problems holding up anagreement in ongoing bilateral talks ``are only of the secondorder.''</TEXT></DOC>
