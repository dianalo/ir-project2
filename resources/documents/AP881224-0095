Yuli Vorontsov, Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan and a firstdeputy foreign minister, said the talks with the exiled king focusedon a proposal for convening a council in Afghanistan of 50 to 60politicians or prominent individuals to create a new government.   Afghan rebels have spoken recently about forming a broad-basedgovernment to succeed the Soviet-backed regime. But Vorontsov'scomments were the most detailed yet made publicly about the newproposal.   The Soviet official said his government had presented the plan toPakistan-based Moslem rebels earlier this month and ``we are stillwaiting for (their) word.''   Vorontsov said the two-hour session Saturday with former KingMohammad Zaher Shah was ``very useful.'' Zaher Shah has lived inItaly since he was overthrown in 1973.   ``We had a very long extensive discussion which covered lots ofelements of the plan, of the future, (of) possibilities,'' he toldreporters at the residence of the Soviet ambassador to Rome.   He declined, however, to say whether the king was receptive togoing back to Afghanistan as part of a transitional government.   While the 74-year-old ex-king still has a following inAfghanistan, some Moslem resistance groups remain strongly opposedto him.   The Soviets are anxious to see a stable government in place thatwill end the 10-year-old Afghanistan war and not persecute Afghancommunists.   Moscow signed an accord with the United States in April underwhich the Soviets are to withdraw their estimated 115,000 troopsfrom Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989.   However, Moscow has since suspended the pullout, charging thatthere have been violations of the accords by the United States andPakistan, who back the rebels. The war has continued.   Vorontsov declared that the different Afghan groups had to startnegotiating with each other.   ``There is a suggestion that comes from Pakistan that the firstinitial group of representatives of all kinds of political factions,50-60 persons, get together, in the capacity of the representativesof political parties or in their personal capacity as authoritativefigures, but sitting together starting to formulate the future ofAfghanistan,'' he said.   He added that the group should form a ruling body oradministrative council that would govern until new elections couldbe called.   Vorontsov said the plan had the approval of some rebels, thePakistani government and the Afghan government. He said it would bepresented shortly to Afghan rebel groups based in Iran.   The new ruling council could be put together by Feb. 15, he said.   Vorontsov also said that several Afghan rebel groups were holdingsecret talks with the Soviet-backed Najib government. ThePakistan-based rebels have vowed never to deal with Najib.   In an address to the United Nations earlier this month, SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev proposed a Jan. 1 cease-fire inAfghanistan and a cut-off of all military supplies to the country.   ``We still think that it is feasible to work with that targetdate in mind,'' Vorontsov said.   There was no comment from the former Afghan king about Saturday'smeeting, which took place at his walled compound in Rome. Hisspokesman, Gen. Abdul Wali, told reporters that the Soviet official``had been received for an exchange of views.''   In the past, Zaher Shah has been guarded in his publicstatements, saying that Afghan leaders should be assembled to decideon a transition team.   Afghanistan has been locked in civil war since the April 1978revolution that brought a socialist government to power in theIslamic nation.   Soviet troops were sent to the neighboring country in 1979 toprop up the allied government.   Zaher Shah lost his throne when his cousin and former primeminister, Mohammed Daud, seized power in July 1973. The king, whohad been in power for 40 years, was in Italy at the time, taking arheumatism cure at the baths in Ischia.   Leftists in the army supported the coup and anti-communist exilesbelieve it paved the way for the more openly pro-Soviet coup in 1978.</TEXT></DOC>
