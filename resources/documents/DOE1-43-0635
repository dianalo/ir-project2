Several weldingprocesses were evaluated, including gas tungsten arc, electron beam,friction, capacitor discharge, and explosive welding. Heat-affected zonegrain growth was suppressed. Residual helium in the centrifugally atomizedmaterial was found to form moderate to severe porosity in all fusionwelding processes; porosity appeared to be suppressed in friction andexplosive welding. High energy density fusion welding processes (electronbeam and capacitor discharge) were thermally modeled, and solidificationwas found to occur at cooling rates far exceeding those of the originalpowder material and to produce correspondingly fine microstrucures. 10refs., 9 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
