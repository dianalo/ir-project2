In the absence of higher interest rates in the U.S., many currency traders and analysts say intervention is the last weapon left in the central banks' arsenal.    Leading central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, bought well over $1.5 billion of the U.S. currency in the week between Christmas and New Year's Day to try to stem the dollar's sharp fall. Officials in Europe hope that the dollar is approaching the point where the currency markets will decide it is oversold.    The Bank of Japan was reportedly intervening moderately in early trading in Tokyo Monday. After falling to postwar lows during trading on New Year's Eve, the dollar was quoted at 121.30 yen in late morning dealings Monday in Tokyo, up from 121.10 yen in late New York trading Thursday and Thursday's intraday low of 121.00 yen. The dollar also stood at 1.5760 West German marks late Monday morning in Tokyo, up from 1.5705 marks and 1.5700 marks respectively.    The dollar had opened Monday in Tokyo at 120.45 yen, and traders said the U.S. currency was recovering by late morning because of short covering led by U.S. banks as well as the moderate Bank of Japan intervention.    Previously, the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, in their latest statement on the dollar issued Dec. 23, had only said that a further decline or other excessive fluctuation in the dollar's value could hurt world economic growth. However, in a disclosure that seemed to go beyond the statement, one participant in the negotiations on the statement said the countries reached a general understanding on broad trading ranges for the major currencies.    Central banks want exchange rates &quot;to stay within&quot; the undisclosed trading limits, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.    When the communique was issued, U.S. officials said there was an explicit understanding as to how far the Group of Seven --the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada --would let the dollar rise. But they didn't mention any lower limits for its trading range.    European central bankers said they expect the Fed to join in braking the dollar's latest fall. Fed action is crucial to assuring the markets that Washington isn't happy with the dollar's headlong descent. European central bankers said the U.S. central bank intervened &quot;heavily&quot; between Christmas and New Year's. The Fed, as is its custom, wouldn't comment on reports of its activity.    Nonetheless, analysts, traders and some officials have said repeatedly that they expect the foreign exchange markets to try to take the dollar to record lows again today.    &quot;I think that the markets are going to take on the authorities aggressively,&quot; Geoffrey Dennis, currency economist with London stockbrokers James Capel andamp; Co., said.    Analysts said the dollar decline last week amounted to a vote of no confidence in efforts by the Group of Seven and the central banks to defend the currency. It was quickly apparent, they said, that the U.S. wasn't ready to support the dollar with new policies.    Calls for Washington to boost the dollar through firm action aimed at cutting its budget and trade deficits have been widespread for months but haven't been heeded by the Reagan administration or Congress.    &quot;It really was a red rag to a bull,&quot; Paul Chertkow, director of economics at the London securities house Security Pacific Hoare Govett, said of the seven-nation statement on the currency. &quot;It didn't talk about dollar stability, but about policy coordination.&quot;    In contrast to last February's so-called Louvre accord, the December statement avoided precise language that would commit the seven nations to cooperate closely in defending the dollar's value.    Although U.S. officials may have thought that a recent U.S. budget-cutting accord would help the dollar, analysts said, the markets clearly have signaled that the action wasn't sufficient. They said West Germany's reluctance to stimulate its economy more forcefully is another reason the currency markets aren't convinced that world economic imbalances will start to ease soon.    European officials clearly are frustrated that the U.S. still appears to rule out higher interest rates as a means of attracting investors to its currency and halting the dollar's fall. U.S. officials have indicated they fear that higher rates could lead to a recession in the wake of the October stock market crash.    &quot;I think that if (Fed Chairman Alan) Greenspan just said, 'We will raise interest rates when appropriate,' then he might not even have to,&quot; one European official said.    Even though central banks seem willing to resort to intervention to defend the dollar again, one senior central banker has stressed its limits. West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last week that while intervention is necessary at times, it could cause troubles for the monetary policies of such creditor nations as West Germany and Japan.    Both of those nations have sold huge quantities of their currencies to defend the dollar. Mr. Poehl's statement underlined the Bundesbank's well-known concern that this action could have inflationary consequences.    Capel's Mr. Dennis said the latest bout of pressure on the U.S. currency might force the Fed to show its hand, despite U.S. reluctance to raise interest rates and risk recession.    &quot;I do think there is a much more significant chance of a tightening in (U.S.) monetary policy,&quot; he said.    In addition, a growing number of economists now say the dollar may have overshot its level of economic equilibrium on the way down. If the November U.S. trade report due Jan. 15 shows a narrower deficit, or if there is a shift in Fed policy, that might provide the respite the dollar needs, at least in the short term.    &quot;When that comes, I think the (dollar) could rally and rally quite sharply,&quot; Mr. Dennis said.    As trading ended for 1987, a round of Japanese and European central bank intervention failed to check the U.S. currency's decline.    Traders said the slide Thursday was prompted by continued bearishness in an extremely thin market as some market participants sought to get a jump on this week's trading by unloading dollars.    Traders in Tokyo Thursday estimated that the Bank of Japan bought about $800 million to $1 billion to support the U.S. currency. The bank doesn't comment officially on its market intervention.    The Swiss and West German banks confirmed they stepped in but gave no figures. Dealers said trading was thin and the intervention was relatively small.    A statement by the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, Beryl Sprinkel, that the Reagan administration's position regarding the dollar remains unchanged added to the impetus to dump dollars.    &quot;The Sprinkel statement just shows that the administration doesn't mind seeing the dollar slide,&quot; a trader at a large West German bank in New York said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Thursday, gold for current delivery rose $3.50 an ounce to $486.20 in active trading. Estimated volume was nine million ounces. Gold was quoted at $488.35 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    --- -                Late New York Trading                 Thursday, Dec. 31, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
