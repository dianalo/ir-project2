The annualincidence of this tumor in Sweden was calculated to be 0.09 cases permillion. This figure was obtained by reviewing a Swedish series of spindlecell sarcomas of bone of which one quarter (11/44) were diagnosed byus as primary leiomyosarcoma. The diagnosis was based on light- and electron-microscopicexaminations using the same criteria as for leiomyosarcoma of soft tissues.Thirteen tumors were located in a long bone of an extremity (nine closeto the knee joint) and three in the central skeleton. Radiographically,all the tumors presented as a purely osteolytic lesion, and three patientshad sustained a pathologic fracture. In four of six cases angiographysuggested malignancy by revealing hypervascularity, irregular tortuousvessels, and diffuse contrast opacification. Contrast-enhanced computedtomography, performed in two cases, showed hypervascular areas withinthe tumors. Scintigraphy showed a marked increase in radionuclide uptakein all five cases studied. The clinical behavior indicates that primaryleiomyosarcoma of bone is highly malignant. Eight patients had died ofthe tumor and, of the eight patients who were alive at follow-up, twohad metastases, and one had been operated on three times for a cutaneousmetastasis, which had recurred locally twice. The remaining five patientshad been continuously free of disease for 6.5 to 12.3 years.</TEXT></DOC>
