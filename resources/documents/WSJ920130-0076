Macy andamp; Co.'s bank lenders are beingforced to make almost $600 million in loans under previouscommitments, despite risks that the loans might not be repaidin full.   Macy filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection Mondayunder the weight of $5.32 billion in debt, which means thesenew loans could be placed on nonperforming status soon afterthey are made, bankers in the deal said.</LP><TEXT>   Banks are providing two separate loans totaling about $580million because the Chapter 11 filing dried up other sourcesof credit and placed the company in default of certainobligations.   As a result, a Citicorp-led bank syndicate began toprovide loans this week to replace $180 million in commercialpaper, bankers close to the deal said. And yesterday Macy's40-member bank syndicate, led by Manufacturers Hanover TrustCo. and Bankers Trust New York Corp., made a $400 millionloan to Federated Department Stores that Macy owed in theform of a note. Federated itself is expected to emerge fromChapter 11 next week after two years of protection.   Bankers say they expect the loans eventually to be repaidbecause they are secured by collateral, but it will add totheir level of nonperforming loans and could cause some banksto set aside additional loan-loss provisions. The new loansare believed to rank in the same class as the $296 million inexisting Macy bank loans, which are quoted in the secondarybank loan market at a steep discount to face value. In anumber of bankruptcy-law cases, however, senior creditorshave emerged unscathed.   Much like an insurance policy, these prior agreements tolend, often in the form of a letter of credit, are used bycorporations in times of crisis or to obtain a top-gradecredit rating for the sale of securities. Banks charge annualfees in exchange for the promise to lend in the future, andhave the contractual obligation to lend even under distressedsituations.   But banks are finding in many cases that they are lendingmoney to clients just when their finances are deteriorating.In essence, banks are the lenders of last resort at whatcould be the worst possible time. The Macy loans are unlikelyto pay interest without bankruptcy court approval.   &quot;We have a legal and moral obligation to fund it,&quot; saidone of the lenders.   While Macy's overall debt remains the same, banks are nowmaking loans and taking on risk that had been held by othercreditors. While the two loans are believed to be widelysyndicated among many banks, advancing funds to an alreadydistressed company underscores the riskiness of so-calledoff-balance sheet activities that mushroomed in the 1980s.Banks have hundreds of billions of dollars in these creditcommitments that periodically come back to haunt them.   Last year, for instance, a Citicorp-led syndicate wasforced to refinance commercial paper issued by First CapitalCorp., which filed for bankruptcy-law protection last year,with a $260 million loan. There's now an acute risk that theloans won't be repaid in full, and Citicorp was forced to setaside almost $200 million in reserves for the loan.   &quot;Ironically you make these loans knowing you might not getall your money back,&quot; said one banker.   The new loans are separate from the $600 milliondebtor-in-possession loan Macy obtained from Chemical BankingCorp. and Bankers Trust to pay suppliers and salaries forongoing operations. This socalled DIP financing is consideredlow risk because it has the first lien on assets and isrepaid first when a company emerges from bankruptcy-lawproceedings.   The $180 million loan will be drawn as the commercialpaper matures, a syndicate member said.   Thomas Fritz of Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said, &quot;The bankshave to step in and make sure the notes are paid on a timelybasis. As far as we know, the banks fully intend to honor thecommitments.&quot;   These loans replacing the commercial paper are valued atabout 70 cents on the dollar currently because of theuncertainty surrounding the Chapter 11 filing, said KevinMeenan of Meenan McDevitt andamp; Co., a firm specializing in loanvaluations. But Mr. Meenan believes banks should ultimatelybe repaid in full because of the collateral.   Separately, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland approveda request from Macy enabling the company immediately to drawupon $60 million of the proposed $600 million DIP loan.   The funding will enable Macy to receive fresh merchandisefrom suppliers. In courtroom testimony, Myron Ullman, vicechairman of Macy, said that the retailer had only $200,000 incash on hand when the retailer filed for bankruptcy-lawprotection. &quot;We paid as many vendors as possible, and didn'tsee the reason to hoard cash,&quot; explained Mr. Ullman.   A hearing on the full debtor-in-possession financingfacility is scheduled for Feb. 13.</TEXT></DOC>
