The engineering and construction concern said it has hired the investment-banking firm of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to &quot;enhance shareholder values&quot; through a sale, possibly to a utility, of an interest in its cogeneration operations. Funds will be used to strengthen CRS Sirrine's &quot;potential for growth in the independent&quot; electricity market, the company said.    With a platoon of engineers experienced in power-plant design, CRS Sirrine has pressed hard for the last four years to position itself as a leader in the fragmented cogeneration market. It is now involved in five projects, which will produce 434,000 kilowatts of electricity.    Cogeneration is the production of electricity and steam with a single fuel source, most commonly natural gas. Cogeneration's growth has been encouraged by falling natural-gas prices and a 1978 federal law that stipulated utilities must purchase excess electricity from independent power producers. Further deregulation of the electricity monopolies is under study by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and is expected to represent a huge growth opportunity for independent power producers.    &quot;We think in the '90s there will be more activity in this area than there has been to date,&quot; said CRS Sirrine executive vice president Richard Daerr. In addition, the company's board doesn't think the current stock price &quot;reflects its underlying values including the value of its power and congeneration business,&quot; said Bruce Wilkinson, CRS Sirrine president.    The company has nearly recaptured its pre-stock-market crash high of $25.50 a common share. Reaction was very favorable on Wall Street with yesterday's announcement. &quot;They can probably get a pretty fancy price for half of that (cogeneration) business,&quot; said analyst Mark Kurland of Mabon, Nugent andamp; Co., who placed the value of the entire operation at $50 million to $70 million. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, CRS Sirrine closed yesterday at $24.75 a share, up $1.875.    CRS Sirrine's largest cogeneration project is a 356,000 kilowatt plant in Hopewell, Va. that will sell electricity to Virgina Electric andamp; Power Co., a unit of Dominion Resources Inc. That plant is being built as a 50-50 joint venture with a unit of Transco Energy Co. of Houston. CRS Sirrine's other projects use wood or mining waste to generate electricity, all of which will be sold to utilities.    Separately, the company announced its board adopted a &quot;poison-pill,&quot; anti-takeover defense. Such a defense plan makes hostile takeovers prohibitvely expensive, though CRS Sirrine says it knows of no immediate takeover &quot;effort.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
