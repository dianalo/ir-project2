Lilco shares closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading above the offering price -- at $9.125, up 12.5 cents -- and the financially troubled electric and gas utility has repeatedly indicated it wouldn't seriously discuss a takeover by the power authority, a locally controlled public agency.    A spokesman for the Hicksville, N.Y.-based utility said the company hasn't yet received the proposal from the power authority. When Lilco receives the bid, the board will review it and make a recommendation to holders, he said.    The total cost to acquire Lilco would be about $7.45 billion, the power authority said. That would include purchasing the common and subsequently buying the preferred shares, and also would include debt redemption, much of it related to the Shoreham nuclear power plant.    The offer came after a study by Lazard Freres andamp; co. concluded that Long Island ratepayers would save about 12% on their utility bills, or about $3 billion over 15 years, under a power authority takeover.    The power authority said its offer would have several conditions, would be subject to negotiation and would stand until April 15. One of the conditions is that Lilco receive favorable treatment next month in a rate case before the New York Public Service Commission, an uncertain proposition.    It said it arrived at an offering price by taking the approximate average trading price of Lilco stock for the past 30 days. Speculators have been anticipating an offer from the power authority of about $13 to $15 a share.    The low offer enhances Lilco's option to file suit against the power authority on the grounds that the authority is trying to inflict a fire sale on Lilco holders.    The power authority said it would finance the takeover by issuing bonds. Bond experts have previously questioned the authority's ability to raise the necessary funds. </TEXT></DOC>
