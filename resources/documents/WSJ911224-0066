The Salomon Inc. unit traditionally paid its employees andexecutives based on a formula tied to their individualperformance, along with that of the firm and of theirdepartment. The overall bonus pool was determined by thefirm's profits. But this formula led to inflated pay packagesfor some employees who weren't pulling their weight.</LP><TEXT>   Now, the big investment bank will base its pay system onbusiness units operating effectively as independent profitcenters, Salomon executives said. In 1992, Salomon'sexecutives will be paid based on their division'sprofitability, the executives said.   Details of the plan, which is expected to be finalizednext month, couldn't be determined. Salomon declined tocomment. But the new plan reflects the new pay attitude ofWarren Buffett, Salomon's interim chief executive. Mr.Buffett has aggressively been moving to change Salomon'sculture, including its pay practices, in the wake of itsTreasury-auction bidding violations.   In a letter to shareholders in October, Mr. Buffett saidSalomon's &quot;lackluster overall profits of recent yearsresulted from a combination of excellent earnings in a fewareas of the business . . . with inadequate or nonexistentearnings at the remainder. Yet the compensation plan did nottake this extreme unevenness into account.&quot;   The planned pay shift isn't the first at Salomon in thewake of its Treasury-auction scandal. In October, Mr. Buffetttook back $110 million Salomon had earlier slated for bonusesto traders and investment bankers. The most recent shift wasfirst reported in Wall Street Letter, a trade publication.   Mr. Buffett and Deryck Maughan, Salomon's chief operatingofficer, also have scrapped the special pay arrangements thathad been negotiated between former chairman John Gutfreundand important Salomon employees. Those pay pacts, launched in1990, triggered huge bonuses for some top Salomon traders.One such special pay deal led Salomon to pay LawrenceHilibrand, a bond-arbitrage trader, $23 million in salary andbonus in 1990.   This year, 70% of Salomon's managing directors had theirbonuses slashed from 1990 levels. Average bonuses forSalomon's investment bankers were slashed about 25% from lastyear; average bonuses for Salomon's stock department were cuteven more, people familiar with Salomon said.   In 1990, 106 Salomon Brothers employees each made $1million or more.</TEXT></DOC>
