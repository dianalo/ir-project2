Under the plan, the company will issue one right for each share to stock of record Jan. 5. The rights, which allow holders to buy one-tenth of a share of a new series of participating preferred stock at $100, will be exercisable only if an acquirer accumulates 20% or more of the company's common, or announces an offer to acquire 30% or more. In certain cases, holders also will be entitled to buy either the participating preferred stock or common stock in an &quot;acquiring person&quot; at half the market value. The rights expire Dec. 19, 1996.    Brooks Thomas, chairman, said that directors aren't aware of any hostile takeover efforts, and that officers and employees own more than 40% of the publisher's shares. </TEXT></DOC>
