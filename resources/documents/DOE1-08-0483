Although this study is notmeant to be evaluative, it is designed to help assess by comparison thedecision-making and regulatory mechanisms in U.S. hazard assessment.The chapters on the individual countries are divided into three components:(1) relevant political and administrative traditions that influence expectationsabout and mechanisms of hazard regulation; (2) a compilation of the relevantstatuatory instruments; and (3) the scope of the regulatory jurisdiction.The last category divides the laws into those which govern industrialplants, emmissions and discharges, worker protection, industrial substances,poisons, agricultural chemicals, food additives, and contaminants, consumerproducts, transport, chemical waste, and victim compensation. The studyconcludes with a discussion of ways in which such multinational perspectivesmight be used to strengthen the regulatory process of the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
