<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-1038 </DOCNO><TEXT>The isotope shift in the arc spectrum of tungsten was studied by meansof a photoelectric recording Fabry-Perot spectrometer with digital dataprocessing for the isotopes /sup 182/W, /sup 183/W, /sup 184/W and /sup186/W using highly enriched isotope samples. The measured field shiftsshow that the odd levels z /sup 7/Psup(o)sub(2,3,4) are composed of theconfigurations 5d/sup 5/6p, 5d/sup 4/6s6p and 5d/sup 3/6s/sup 2/6p. Nonrelativistic Hartree-Fock calculations of the field shifts between pureconfigurations allow a determination of the mixing coefficients of theselevels. The relative field shifts are determined, along with the nuclearparameters {lambda}sup(AA').</TEXT></DOC>
