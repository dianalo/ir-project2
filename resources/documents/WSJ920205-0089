Jim Solloway, director of research at Argus Research, saidencouraging comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman AlanGreenspan and better-than-expected sales figures from NorthAmerican auto makers helped to ease investor concerns aboutstocks.   Mr. Greenspan told the House Budget Committee yesterdaythat the central bank will ease interest rates again ifeconomic conditions warrant such a move. Meanwhile, carmanufacturers reported late-January sales at a 6.1million-unit annual rate, higher than analysts expected.   Wheat First's Mr. Jennison said the sharp rally yesterdaysurprised him. &quot;But everybody has been expecting acorrection, and if anything that probably signaled that itwouldn't happen,&quot; he said. &quot;With so much consensus on oneside, it's probably not that surprising that it didn'thappen,&quot; the trader said.   But James Volk, director of OTC institutional trading atCharles Schwab, said stock prices are too high. He is stillexpecting a correction that will push Nasdaq stocks down 5%from current levels.   Argus' Mr. Solloway agrees. &quot;The market has held upextremely well, but I think it's a mistake to ignore thewarning signs,&quot; he said, noting the extreme bullishness ofsome investors and the recent rise in long-term interestrates.   Although Mr. Greenspan's comments spurred a rally in thebond market yesterday -- pushing long-term yields down to7.76% -- rates have been drifting higher for the past severalweeks.
