An extensive review ofavailable literature on existing biomass energy cogeneration facilitieswas made and used to help formulate an economic model for evaluatinginvestments for this study. Three studies were made of actual cases:one each in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Kentucky. To obtain informationfor the hypothetical studies, equipment manufacturers were surveyed bytelephone for data on costs of equipment needed for cogeneration andfuel use. This information was obtained for 15, 10, 5, and 1 millionboard feet sawmills, spanning the sizes found in operation in West Virginia.Results are described.</TEXT></DOC>
