Boone Pickens Jr., said he is splitting with Mr. Pickens to launch his own consulting business.    Although no one disputes that Mr. Pickens is the heart and soul of his company, Mesa Limited Partnership, Mr. Batchelder in the past 10 years has helped to engineer almost every takeover brawl launched by the Amarillo, Texas, oil man -- a veritable Who's Who of corporate targets that includes Phillips Petroleum Co., Gulf Corp., Superior Oil Co. and Unocal Corp.    In an interview, the 38-year-old accountant disclosed that he will move to San Diego at the end of May to launch his own, as-yet unnamed company. &quot;I'll be acting as an investment banker in an advisory role,&quot; he said -- with clients including, perhaps, his old boss.    His reason for leaving, he said, is entirely benign. &quot;Ten years in Amarillo,&quot; he explained, &quot;is enough.&quot;    Messrs. Pickens and Batchelder both emphasized yesterday that however highly regarded Mr. Batchelder has become, he leaves behind several sharp number crunchers at Mesa. &quot;Anytime someone leaves, it's an opportunity for someone else,&quot; Mr. Pickens said in an interview. In describing Mr. Batchelder's own ascent at Mesa, Mr. Pickens said in his recent autobiography that fresh blood in decision-making positions imbues a company with &quot;entrepreneurial spirit.&quot;    The departure of Mr. Batchelder -- six feet tall, prematurely white-haired and of cerebral appearance -- was seen by many on Wall Street and elsewhere as a blow to Mr. Pickens. &quot;He's one of the brightest when it comes to financial strategies and creative ideas in the mergers and acquisition area,&quot; said Joel Reed, chief financial officer of Wagner andamp; Brown, an oil-producing partnership in Midland, Texas, that worked directly with Mr. Batchelder as an investor in the Phillips and Unocal deals. &quot;He has an innate street sense about how a transaction may play out.&quot;    On Wall Street, some also questioned whether his departure was a sign that the three-man deal-making team led by Mr. Batchelder was crumbling. But Mr. Batchelder and Mr. Pickens scoffed at such suggestions.    Sidney Tassin and Drew Craig, both hired a number of years ago by Mr. Batchelder, will remain with Mr. Pickens, with Mr. Tassin assuming the duties of chief point man on financial matters. &quot;Sid and Drew will take on new responsibilities,&quot; Mr. Batchelder said. &quot;It's good for them and good for me.&quot;    The investment banking community was also abuzz with rumors that Mr. Batchelder's departure signals not just restlessness, but discontent with Mesa's recent spate of failed or aborted takeover efforts. But Mr. Batchelder vehemently denied such suggestions. His decision, he explained, was strictly personal.    &quot;It's a significant sacrifice to live in Amarillo,&quot; he said. Strung along an interstate highway in the vast flatness of the Panhandle, Amarillo essentially is &quot;a large truck stop,&quot; he said, whose amenities are mostly confined to &quot;every restaurant chain there is.&quot;    But the Oklahoma-born Mr. Batchelder acknowledged that Amarillo and Mr. Pickens have been good to him. He arrived there short of money and long on family -- a wife and three children -- after leaving a $30,000-a-year job as an audit manager in the Houston office of Deloitte, Haskins andamp; Sells, an accounting firm. He joined Mesa as an assistant to a vice president, but he rose to the rank of controller within two years and ultimately to the presidency of Mesa Petroleum Co. When Mesa later transformed itself into a limited partnership, Mr. Batchelder became a consultant.    Although he won't say what he's worth now, several people who know him say he's leaving with several million dollars in his pocket -- enough seed money to make him a principal in some of the deals he says he is hoping to originate. Mr. Batchelder reaped sizable earnings through the &quot;success&quot; fees he was paid for his brinkmanship in Mesa's takeover battles.    Mr. Batchelder said he told Mr. Pickens about his decision to break with Mesa nine months ago. He recalls Mr. Pickens saying that &quot;he hated to see a great team start to split up, but that he understood.&quot;    And the two partners appear far from finished with one another. Mr. Batchelder said he &quot;will bring deals to Boone,&quot; as well as to other potential backers. If, for instance, Mr. Pickens decides to renew his unsuccessful bid for Homestake Mining Co. or to increase his stake in Texaco Inc., Mr. Batchelder said, he &quot;expects to participate.&quot;    Which appears to suit Mr. Pickens just fine. Mr. Pickens insisted that he and Mr. Batchelder will continue doing deals together &quot;until they die.&quot;    ---   George Getschow and Bryan Burrough contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
