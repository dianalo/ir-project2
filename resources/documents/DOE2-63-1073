While the extension of macroadenomas is regularly detected, onlymeticulous techniques using coronary scanning following intravenous bolusinjection of contrast agent coupled with knowledge of artefacts and normalvariations can allow sufficient certainty in the diagnosis of intrasellarlesions. In this respect, the finding of a localized, round hypodenseregion within the pituitary is of major importance. The so-called indirectsigns of a pituitary mass are of minor significance. Demonstrations oftypical changes in the CAT scan in combination with the clinical andhormonal findings can contribute to the differential diagnosis of diseasesof the pituitary region.</TEXT></DOC>
