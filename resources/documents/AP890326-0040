Jalalabad had a pre-war population of about 200,000 a decadeago. With many people fleeing the war to neighboring Pakistan or toother parts of Afghanistan, the population now is thought to beless than 100,000.   Amani said government artillery and warplanes attacked therebels at Chaparhar and Karizi Kbir, both west of Jalalabad, and atSurkhrod to the east.   He also said a large number of weapons were destroyed, includingsix multiple rocket-launchers, three arms and ammunition depots andtwo tanks.   Amani also said the guerrillas blew up two mini-buses carryingcivilians on Sunday. He said he did not know how many people wereaboard the buses.   He said one attack occurred on the road connecting Kabul withthe northeast province of Laghman. The other, he said, occurred onthe Jalalabad-Kabul highway.   He also said the guerrillas detonated land mines that killed 10people on two other buses in the past 24 hours. He said one attackoccurred at Islam Qala near the Iranian border, while the otherhappened at Sayed Karem in Paktia province, which borders Pakistan.   In Kabul, where basic foods have grown scarcer and moreexpensive because of guerrilla attacks on roads leading to the cityand an exceptionally harsh winter, a small-scale free-fooddistribution program was resumed by the United Nations on Sunday.   In Khair Khanna, one of the city's poorer districts, 600 womenand children were given 22 pounds of flour and 6.6 Pounds of sugareach.
