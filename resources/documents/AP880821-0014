The largest sum _ $11 billion _ is needed in Latin America andthe Caribbean, followed by $9.3 billion in East Asia and thePacific, and another $9.3 billion in the poorer countries of theMiddle East, North Africa and Europe.   The bank's experts said they were talking about a third of allpaved roads outside of towns and a quarter of the unpaved roads in85 countries. They found that 40 percent of the paved roads willneed repair in the next 10 years, at a cost of another $40 billion.   In 1984, the most recent year for which the report givesfigures, the countries concerned put out $6.5 billion for repairand maintenance.   ``But if these countries do not improve the management of roads,the eventual cost of restoration could easily increase two- tothreefold, and the cost to users could rise even more,'' the reportwarned.   The World Bank, owned by 151 countries, is the biggest singlesource of loans to help poor countries raise their livingstandards. It has lent about $15.5 billion for roads since it wasfounded at the end of World War II.   Routine maintenance can cost as little as $480 a mile, whilerebuilding can cost more than $480,000 a mile, the report said.   The experts found the hard core of the problem in southernAfrica. They took 61 Third World countries all over the world andfound that 16 of them had budgets too small to pay for the roadsthey need. Of those 16, there were 11 where citizens' incomes havebeen declining. Nine of the 11 are south of the Sahara.   They found a different problem in China, India, Pakistan,Bangladesh and Burma. Many of their roads were built long ago inways that do not suit today's traffic, and should simply bereplaced, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
