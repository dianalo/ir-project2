Clore said he lowered his stake in Rorer Group Inc. to the equivalent of 12.1% of the common shares outstanding.    According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nerval andamp; Manor Inc., a company Mr. Clore controls, sold 738,800 common shares of the Fort Washington, Pa.-based pharmaceutical concern from April 27 through April 30 at $45.50 to $47 a share.    As a result, Mr. Clore controls the equivalent of 2,636,100 shares, assuming exercise of certain options. The shares are held by Nerval andamp; Manor and NMI Partners, whose general partner is controlled by Mr. Clore.    The filing also said Eugene C. Dooner Jr., a Naples, Fla., investor who is a limited partner in NMI Partners, holds an additional 443,097 Rorer shares, or 2% of the total outstanding.    Mr. Clore didn't give a reason in the filing for reducing his stake.    Last May, Mr. Clore retained Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. to advise him on alternatives for his investment in Rorer, including the possible sale of all or a portion of his holdings.    In March 1986, Mr. Clore raised his stake in Rorer to 13% from 9% and formed a partnership with Mr. Dooner, a dissident shareholder.    A spokeswoman for Rorer declined comment on Mr. Clore's filing; Mr. Clore couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
