The action came even before the final accident report,which the independent National Transportation Safety Board iscompleting. But while the FAA said its own special review haddetermined that &quot;no major design feature of the airplanes orautopilot could be linked to the accidents,&quot; it appointed ateam to consider whether the FAA should mandate increasedpilot training for high-performance, high-altitude airplanesin the Malibu's class.</LP><TEXT>   Any &quot;airworthiness directive&quot; mandating special trainingfor sporty non-jet aircraft would be controversial inaviation circles, where such groups as the Aircraft Ownersand Pilots Association generally have opposed new governmentrequirements for private pilots, favoring voluntary trainingprograms instead.   The official NTSB report on the seven fatal accidents,which occured between May 1989 and March 1991, isn't expectedto be released until at least next month. In general, though,investigators have said it will blame a combination offactors including pilot judgment, training deficiencies, anautomatic-pilot system that is prone to glitches, and weatherconditions. The NTSB -- which says it cooperated with theFAA's &quot;special certification review,&quot; although the FAA studywas conducted separately -- also expects to recommendmodifications in various Malibu system designs. The FAA teamidentified four specific designs that it is reviewing forpossible new airworthiness directives.   In Vero Beach, Fla., Piper Aircraft Corp. applauded therelaxing of restrictions on the Malibu and on the newerMirage version of the six-seat, single-engine pistonaircraft. Piper, which claims to have spent $1 millioncooperating with the government's investigations, has beenoperating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Codesince last July. It has said many of its problems stemmedfrom potential lenders who feared lawsuits relating tocrashes of the range of planes Piper has built over theyears.   More than 520 Malibus and Mirages -- which sell for about$400,000 and have been popular with entrepreneurial&quot;owner-pilots&quot; -- have been delivered. The FAA ruling willdirectly affect the 400 or more planes operated in the U.S.   M. Stuart Millar, Piper's owner, said the decision by theFAA &quot;fully supports what has been Piper's claim all along,&quot;that the airplane is sound, &quot;but a focus is needed on pilottraining and systems familiarity.&quot;   In a statement, Allied-Signal Co., maker of theBendix/King autopilot that investigators have sometimescriticized during their work, said it was &quot;pleased with theFAA's finding that no major design feature of its Bendix/KingKFC-150 autopilot could be linked to accidents involving thePiper Malibu.&quot;   Malibu pilots also heralded the FAA ruling. One group ofowners called the Malibu Coalition said the FAA's decision&quot;vindicates the Malibu aircraft completely.&quot; But LanghorneBond, a former FAA administrator and Washington lawyer whorepresents the group, said he was &quot;very pleased at the strongemphasis in the FAA report on the area of pilotqualifications.&quot; Many pilots have said they believe pilottraining needs to be stricter for new generations ofsophisticated, complex aircraft such as the Malibu, which hasa pressurized cabin that allows it to fly at an altitude of25,000 feet, almost as high as jetliners.   &quot;The truth is, these are even harder to fly than even theCitation jet,&quot; a business aircraft for which pilots need aspecial &quot;type-rating,&quot; Mr. Bond said. He added that the FAAtraditionally &quot;has extremely permissive rules for pilottraining, for private flying for your own account,&quot;especially compared with the stiff requirements for winning arating as an airline pilot.   An FAA spokeswoman said that a special type-rating for theMalibu isn't being considered, but the agency did say thatits new team will study &quot;future rule-making and promotingimproved pilot training in the Malibu and Mirage plus anyother airplanes with this level of high performance.&quot;   Phil Boyer, president of the Aircraft Owners and PilotsAssociation, said his organization was pleased that therestrictions were lifted and added that the AOPA believes &quot;atype-rating isn't needed for these airplanes&quot; that havehigh-performance characteristics. Better training programs byaircraft manufacturers, along with new pilot requirementsfrom insurance companies covering aircraft operators, wouldbe the best way to improve pilot standards, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
