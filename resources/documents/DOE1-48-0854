<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-0854 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new type of cosmic noise absorption (CNA) pulsation is observed witha scanning beam riometer with a spatial resolution of 10 km, at Syowastation, Antarctica (L = 6.1). This type of CNA pulsation has a shortazimuthal wavelength (80--600 km), correspnding to a large azimuthalm-number (20--180). Most CNA pulsations with a period of 1 to 10 minpropagate eastward at a speed of 200 m/s to 3 km/s in the morning sector(5--10 MLT). The eastward propagation direction is opposite to that ofCNA pulsations with a small m-number as reported by Olson et al. (1980).The pulsation period tends to increase, while the propagation speed decreaseswith increasing local time. These results suggest that the source ofthis new type of CNA pulsation first appears in the nightside magnetosphereand moves toward noon. It is pointed out that the finding of this newCNA pulsation is due to the high spatial resolution (10 km) and narrowantenna beam (13{sup 0}) of the scanning riometer system. copyright AmericanGeophysical Union 1988</TEXT></DOC>
