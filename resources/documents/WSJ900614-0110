Everyonewants property taxes reduced, and you can be the one whomakes it happen.   In the past five years, companies have boomed by teachingaspiring entrepreneurs the ropes of a fast-growing, littleregulated field: appealing property tax assessments.</LP><TEXT>   Some graduates are making a good living at the work, alegitimate service for property owners. But a rising numberof trainees, after spending thousands of dollars withoutturning a profit, are complaining bitterly that they weremisled.   Through seminars and mail-order manuals, the firms arechurning out scores of graduates at a steady clip. Two yearsago, Deborah Gates answered a magazine ad for a course byLear McNally Corp. The three-day course and materials cost$7,500, but the Philadelphia training company offered amoney-back guarantee of success. Lear's promotional materialsaid the work required neither experience nor licenses, andit promised three years of &quot;ongoing education and support. .. .&quot;   After taking the course, Mrs. Gates discovered a realestate license is indeed required to state an opinion of landvalue for a property assessment appeal in her home, DadeCounty, Fla. Also, the county's appeals process variedconsiderably from what Lear taught. On a part-time basis,Mrs. Gates is trying to appeal cases. But in two years, shewon only two appeals.   As for the ongoing support, the company recentlydisconnected its phones and is now the target of apreliminary investigation by the U.S. postal inspector inPhiladelphia. None of Lear's principals could be reached forcomment.   Mrs. Gates isn't alone. &quot;At the most, I believe one personout of every class has a chance of making good money,&quot; saysRichard Fogg, a former sales manager with Property TaxConsultants Inc., San Diego, which also offers courses. (Atypical course may have 20 or more students.) &quot;It's a toughbusiness,&quot; he adds.   Many who pay for these courses accuse the training firmsof misleading them on the income they are likely to earn, theease of the appeal process and the availability of clients.Increasingly, they are filing complaints with state attorneysgeneral, Better Business Bureaus and U.S. postal inspectorsaround the country. Pennsylvania's attorney general, forexample, received 15 complaints in the past year. Meanwhile,local property tax review boards complain of frivolousappeals -- stemming from some seminar graduates -- that bogdown the appeals process.   The companies offering the courses deny any wrongdoing andpoint to many successful graduates.   The complaints have grown as the courses themselves havegrown, spurred by rising property taxes in recent years. &quot;Isee a whole new service industry developing,&quot; says BillBarrett, president of Property Tax Reduction Consultants, aNaperville, Ill., tax consulting firm and seminar sponsor.&quot;There is a demand out there.&quot;   Usually for a fee of up to $10,000, a typical firm offersa two-day or five-day course to teach &quot;affiliates&quot; how tochallenge commercial property valuations on a contingencybasis. Success at the work usually depends on finding errorsin tax bills or discrepancies in appraisals.   A handful of firms lead the seminar business nationwide,advertising mostly in entrepreneurial and businesspublications. Often, a company promises from six months tothree years of free backup support, which typically includeshaving questions answered by staff consultants and gettingadvice from real-estate consultants. No firm interviewedwould give the total number of its graduates.   To be sure, tax attorneys and consultants provide a usefulservice for commercial and residential property owners byappealing tax assessments. And many graduates say there ismoney to be made in the field. Kate Frechette, a Rochester,N.Y., affiliate of Property Tax Consultants, recently got anapartment's assessment cut to $1.8 million from $2.4 million.Her fees range from 19% to 51% of a reduction.   But many affiliates complain that the courses don't coverenough ground. &quot;It's really not sufficient -- even after youabsorb all the material,&quot; says Jimmie Lou Jacobs, who took atwo-day course at Property Valuation Consultants Inc.,Joliet, Ill., that sells for $9,900. A $500 computer programbought from PVC proved no more helpful. After hundreds ofletters and calls to property owners in a year and a half,Mrs. Jacobs says she attracted only six clients. Although shegot help from an experienced tax consultant, the local boardrejected all six assessment appeals.   PVC says unsatisfied affiliates aren't working hard enoughor are in the wrong markets. Says Vice President RickNeiswonger: &quot;Everybody isn't going to pick up everything. Weoffer to work with them and help them any way we can.&quot;   But PVC's promotions paint a promising picture. On avideotape for PVC, actor Eddie Albert claims, &quot;Actually about50 cases a year -- just four a month -- can result in anincome a doctor or a lawyer works years to achieve.&quot; PVCPresident Nancy Freeman concedes property tax consulting iscomplex. &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; she tells prospective students in avideotape, &quot;in just two days here in Joliet, we can make youquite expert, and you don't have to have a background in realestate.&quot;   Mr. Neiswonger notes: &quot;A lot of it has to do withindividual talent. It takes a lot of work.&quot;   Yet Joseph Eckert, the International Association ofAssessing Officers' director of education, says: &quot;Paying anyamount of money, one can never learn fee appraisal in a week-- it's simply too short a time.&quot;   Mr. Eckert points out that a Certified AssessmentEvaluator, a professional ranking in the IAAO, requires atleast three 30-hour courses, demonstrations of appraisals,exams and other courses.   Affiliates often find counties base assessments on factorsand cycles that differ dramatically from state to state. InFlorida, for example, properties are revalued or reviewed forassessment every year. Elsewhere, reassessments can be asinfrequent as a decade or more. California reassesses valuesupon sale of property.   Many affiliates complain they aren't told of all the stateand local requirements for tax appeals before they start. Ayear and a half ago, real estate broker Perry Frantzmananswered an ad in this newspaper to become an affiliate ofProperty Tax Consultants. But his career as a tax consultantwas as short-lived as the five-day course he took for $4,995(it now costs $7,500). In New Jersey, he found, only apracticing attorney can appeal corporate real-estate taxassessments in state tax court. He says instructors neverdisclosed this, despite his questions on the matter.   Michael McCormick, president of PTC, says he didn't talkto Mr. Frantzman before Mr. Frantzman took the class. But headds: &quot;We tell everybody they need to check out the localrequirements. It serves us no purpose to put someone into aposition where they can't do business.&quot;   Disgruntled affiliates aren't the only people with gripes.In many states, tax appeal boards -- and even some taxconsulting firms -- have complained about the lack ofdiscretion shown by some consulting affiliates in solicitingclients. Some send mass direct-mail solicitations, thenschedule the assessment-appeal cases before receiving solidcommitments from owners. A few months ago, one affiliatefiled 175 appeals with the DuPage County, Ill., taxassessment office but later withdrew 150.   &quot;Each one of those complaints has to be docketed andscheduled for a hearing,&quot; said Paul Bower, DuPage Countysupervisor of assessments. &quot;Time has to be set aside, and wedon't have a lot of time.&quot; Mr. Bower said his office grantschanges in assessments in about 25% of the appeal cases, allof which can be appealed to the Illinois Property Tax AppealBoard.   The IAAO's Mr. Eckert hopes states soon will adoptlicensing laws and tougher regulations dealing with thisgrowing industry. Very few states -- under 10 -- require somesort of licensing now, he says. Despite numerous appeals, headds: &quot;The tax burden in the community doesn't go away. Ithas to be redistributed somewhere.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
