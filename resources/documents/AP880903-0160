(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A secret new spy satellite circledthe globe in a useless orbit Saturday, leaving the United States tocontinue relying on aging systems for eavesdropping and warning ofmissile attacks.   The satellite, said to be designed for intercepting Sovietcommunications, was propelled into a successful preliminary orbitby a $65 million Titan 34D rocket launched here Friday.   But a source close to the project said the spacecraft failed toachieve a desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the upperstage of the rocket failed to re-ignite.   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thesatellite remained in a sharply elliptical orbit ranging from about100 to 22,300 miles above Earth.
