Cochrane, chief economist and seniorvice president of the New York Stock Exchange. He said the Montgomeryagreement was the first he was aware of, but he said he expected others tofollow.;   Seth J. Gersch, chief administrative officer and a managingdirector of Montgomery Securities, said trading would begin Friday and wouldat first be restricted to eight companies. They are ATandamp;T, Apple, BankAmerica,Boeing, Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Intel and IBM.;   Gersch said eachstock had to be approved by Soviet authorities and were chosen because theywere considered high-quality companies that would be familiar to people in theSoviet Union.;   Under the new arrangement, Soviet citizens and institutionswill be able to place orders for the American stocks with Sovlex Ltd. atwo-year-old Soviet brokerage firm that has a seat on the new Moscow CentralSecurities Exchange. Sovlex in turn will place the orders with MontgomerySecurities, which will buy and sell the securities on American exchanges andhold the stock in the United States.;   Since Montgomery will not acceptpayment in rubles, a big question is how much hard currency is available inthe Soviet Union for stock purchases.;   Gersch said his expectations abouthow much trading would be done in the Soviet Union were so low that &quot;it willbe very difficult not to exceed my expectations.&quot; But the venture could giveMontgomery a leg up in eventually selling Soviet securities to Americans, hesaid.;   Dozens of stock exchanges have been springing up in the Soviet Unionin the last year. The Moscow Central Securities Exchange, one of the largest,trades shares in about 20 Soviet companies, according to Benjamin Lyon, anadjunct professor of Soviet law at the University of San Francisco who firstintroduced Sovlex to Montgomery in September.;   But trading has been slow tocatch on. The concept of buying and selling stocks in the Soviet Union is newand there have been questions about the legal status of stock ownership.;   Inaddition, many of the exchanges are barely more automated than the New YorkStock Exchange was 200 years ago when brokers first met under a buttonwoodtree in lower Manhattan.;   Lyon said he expected buyers of American stockswould mainly be factories that earn hard currency as well as some individualswho have become wealthy from economic liberalization. He said that one Sovietstudy estimated there was as much as $19 billion in foreign currency in theSoviet Union that people were reluctant to invest in Soviet companies.;  Cochrane, of the New York Stock Exchange, agreed. &quot;There's probably a fairamount of Western currency that would like to find a home and do somethingother than sit in a mattress,&quot; he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911127  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  561  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 27, 199100332191,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
