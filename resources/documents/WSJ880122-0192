Gen. Ramos succeeded Rafael Ileto, who resigned yesterday, expressing dissatisfaction with his role in government, the military hierarchy and the fight against the Communist insurgency.    A Ramos protege, Deputy Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa, 52 years old, was named armed forces chief, a move that may not appease fractious elements within the military.    The shake-up in the country's defense establishment, announced by President Corazon Aquino, had been expected since a near-successful military coup last August. &quot;Ileto has been out of the decision-making process for some time now,&quot; a high-ranking military source said. &quot;This merely institutionalizes what the government has been doing.&quot;    The defense position removes any likely hindrance Gen. Ramos may encounter in planning military policy and overseeing operations. More than 40 generals are scheduled to be retired in April, and Gen. Ramos is now ensured a free hand in selecting their replacements, thus further consolidating his hold on the military, defense analysts said.    Equally important, the defense post gives the 59-year-old West Point graduate a political platform. Gen. Ramos has often been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in the 1992 election. He has appeared more and more like a politician since the August coup attempt, giving news conferences and appearing on talk shows, though this role has been somewhat circumscribed by his military position. That restriction has now been removed.    The appointment of Gen. Ramos as defense secretary widens the role of the military within Mrs. Aquino's administration. The Ramos-de Villa tandem, however, isn't likely to appease all elements within the armed forces. There has been dissension within the armed forces on the pace of military reforms since President Aquino assumed office almost two years ago. Rebel soldiers cited the lack of reforms as a reason for mounting the coup attempt in August. They also blamed Gen. Ramos for many of the ills within the military and demanded his resignation.    In announcing the resignation on nationwide televison, Mrs. Aquino praised the 67-year-old Mr. Ileto. But the president has increasingly depended on Gen. Ramos, who helped lead the overthrow of former President Ferdinand Marcos and then ensured that Mrs. Aquino's government survived a number of coup attempts. </TEXT></DOC>
