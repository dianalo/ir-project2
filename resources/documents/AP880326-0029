Twenty-four hours later, all that changed.   With the death of Jennifer Dawn Levin early on the morning ofAug. 26, Dorrian's became _ fairly or unfairly _ a symbol ofyouthful decadence, of teen-agers with too much money and no placeto go.   Among them was Robert Chambers Jr., who sat at the bar drinkingshots of tequila with beer chasers the night he killed Miss Levin.   ``He fouled everybody's life up,'' bar owner John F. ``Jack''Dorrian said recently. ``Who needs this guy?''   After Miss Levin's death, investigators returned to Dorrian'sand closed the bar for 10 days for serving underage patrons inNovember 1986. Dorrian has put the bar up for sale; no buyer hasbeen found.   Chambers, now 21, had been a regular at Dorrian's. He also was acollege dropout who had a very proper upbringing.   Dinner at the Chambers house, located next to the former AndrewCarnegie mansion a few blocks north of Dorrian's, ``always hadsilver involved,'' said Ralph Destino, a friend of Chambers,shortly after Chambers' arrest.   Chambers apparently had no steady job at the time of his arrest,yet was drinking and flirting ``five or six nights a week'' atDorrian's, said its owner.   Interviews in the months since the slaying indicate thatDorrian's remains attractive, a place where young people can gatherin front of an ornate fireplace and play backgammon at the tables.   Regulars said they avoided Dorrian's after Miss Levin died,fearing the bar had been taken over by the curious. But the youngmen and women who grew up in the wealthy neighborhood and knew oneanother in the best prep schools came back.   Miss Levin was not a regular at Dorrian's but was known there.Patrons don't talk much about the case, they said.   ``I come here when I feel like sitting around like I'm in myliving room,'' said Alyssa Donati, 21, who said she has beenfrequenting Dorrian's for five years.   Dorrian himself knows who's who in the bar; he can point out thechild of a well-known writer and the daughter of a presidentialadviser. John Zaccaro Jr., son of ex-Democratic vice presidentialnominee Geraldine Ferraro, was tending bar the night of the death.   Chambers would no longer be welcome, Dorrian said. Otherregulars would say tourists, out-of-towners and the curious are notwelcome either.   ``Parents like their kids to come here,'' Miss Donati said.``Here they know the people are from at least good families,they've been to good colleges, and they're not out to rape people.''</TEXT></DOC>
