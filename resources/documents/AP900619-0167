ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court panel ruled Tuesdaythat the Federal Election Commission ruled improperly that spendinglimits had not been exceeded in the 1983 Senate campaign of DanEvans in Washington State.   The court reversed an earlier U.S. District Court decisionapproving of the FEC's action. The case was sent back to the lowercourt for reconsideration.   The citizens lobby group, Common Cause, had complained to theelection commission that two Republican political action committeeswere affiliated and had ``coordinated'' their spending on Evansbehalf. Together the funds exceeded the federal limit.   The groups were the Republican National Independent ExpenditureCommittee (RNIEC) and the National Republican Senatorial Committee(NRSC).   Evans, who had been appointed to fill the seat left vacant bythe death of Sen. Henry M. Jackson, won a full term in a specialelection in November 1983. He has since left the Senate.   ``We are unable to uphold the commission's decision ... becauseit gives no indication that the agency considered whether the NRSCand the RNIEC were affiliated,'' said the appeals court. ``Thebrief lacks any discussion of the affiliation issue that isindependent of the analysis of the separate coordination issue.''   Under the law, affiliated political action committers are thosethat are established, financed, maintained or controlled by thesame person or group.   In the course of the 1983 campaign, Democrats had complainedthat RNIEC, which had been set up by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., spent$185,000 in ``electiongrams' to Republicans in Washington Stateurging them to turn out to vote in the special election. The RNSCalready had put the maximum $260,000 into Evans' race.   Common cause claimed Rodney Smith served as financial directorand treasurer of the NRSC until two months before he became aco-founder of the other group and that Heinz continued to be amember of NRSC a short time after he became involved with RNIEC.   The appeals court said ``there is simply no indication'' thatthe FEC ever considered whether Smith or Heinz had authority orinfluence over the two committees.</TEXT></DOC>
