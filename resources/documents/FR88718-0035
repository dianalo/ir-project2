Lyons, Director of the National EngineeringLaboratory, (301) 975-2300.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The National Bureau of Standards willprovide one-time seed money to not more than three non-profit organizationsfor the operation of Manufacturing Technology Centers (MTC) serving differentU.S. geographic regions. The goal of the Manufacturing Technology Centersis to accelerate the transfer of advanced manufacturing technology to U.S.industry (especially small and medium-sized companies) and to assist firmsin improving their productivity and competitiveness. Each center will becapable of applying advanced manufacturing techniques to the needs of manufacturerslocated in its region and demonstrate its capability to transfer specificadvanced manufacturing technologies developed at the National Bureau ofStandards' Automated Manufacturing Research Facility. Applicants must identifythe technologies to be demonstrated and transferred by the proposed center.To accomplish the technology transfer mission effectively, each centershall be active in assisting the adoption of advanced manufacturing techniquesby U.S. industry. Each center shall work with firms within its region toimprove their manufacturing and process capabilities. The services of thecenter shall be available to firms located in its state, in its region,and elsewhere. Also, each center is expected to amplify (leverage) itsregional efforts so its technology transfer experience will have nationalimpact.The transfer of pragmatic technology applications is the primary objectiverather than performance of basic research. This task requires that eachcenter must: (1) Inform and educate the industrial firms in its region;(2) demonstrate the applicability of advanced technology to these firms;(3) actively assist firms to evaluate their requirements; (4) assist withimplementation of desired applications; (5) support work force trainingand retraining; and (6) amplify appropriate transfer experiences to a relevantnational audience. Each center shall operate as an active agent in precipitatingtechnology transfer, rather than operating as a passive agent that onlyprovides information.Each MTC will be operated by a nonprofit organization which already mayexist or may be incorporated specifically for this purpose. NBS will supportthe operating budget of each center for the purpose of carrying out thisprogram on an equal matching-funds basis with the host organization providingthe remaining financial support. The matching share must meet the criteriain Attachment E of OMB Circular A-110. The funds provided by NBS may beused for capital and operating and maintenance expenses. NBS will providetechnical and financial support for the Program, and will assist each centerwith its planning and implementation activities for this Program duringthe time that the centers are receiving seed monies. NBS will monitor theperformance of each center in meeting its technology transfer mission andin fulfilling its fund-matching requirements for this Program.A national competition will be held during 1988 to make the Operating Awards.It is anticipated that up to three Operating Awards of up to $1.5 millioneach will be made. The amount of NBS investment in each Program will dependupon the particular requirements and plans for the Program, as well asthe availability of NBS funds. No further appropriations will be soughtfor this Program.The purpose of the Manufacturing Technology Centers Program is to acceleratethe diffusion of productivity-enhancing advanced manufacturing technologyto U.S. industry (especially small and medium-sized companies). This purposewill be achieved through the:(1) Rapid transfer to industry of new specific advanced manufacturing technologiesincluding those developed at the NBS Automated Manufacturing Research Facility;(2) Active participation from industry, universities, Federal/State government,and NBS in the Program;(3) Efforts to make new manufacturing technology and processess availableand usable by U.S.-based industries, especially small and medium-sizedcompanies;(4) Dissemination of scientific, engineering, and management informationabout manufacturing to industrial firms including small and medium-sizedmanufacturing companies; and(5) Utilization where appropriate of the technical expertise and capabilitythat exist in Federal laboratories other than NBS, when centers and thelaboratories find it to be in their mutual interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposal Review Process</ITAG>NBS will provide all proposals to a Merit Review Panel organized by theNational Research Council which will evaluate the proposals. NBS will considerthe evaluations of the Merit Review Panel and make a selected number ofOperating Awards, to the extent feasible and within limitations of availablefunds. Applications should be in sufficient detail to permit NBS to evaluatethe proposal under the criteria set forth in the six general categoriesbelow:(a) Program Relevance(1) The specific advanced manufacturing technologies including those developedat the NBS Automated Manufacturing Research Facility which will be demonstratedand transferred to a wide range of companies and enterprises in the regionand whenever possible, small and medium-size manufacturers.(b) Technical Capability(1) Relevant experience and education of the full-time key technical staff.(2) Adequacy of the facilities and equipment to support the proposed Program.(3) Proximity and availability of staff to service the targeted industrialbase.(4) Adequacy of the work force training and retraining activites.(5) Relevance of the applicants technical capabilities to the needs ofthe regional industrial base.(c) Market Requirements(1) Appropriateness of the regional target user groups; i.e., the identification,analysis, and justification of the regional industries to be served. Thisincludes an assessment of the needs and receptivity of these groups totechnology transfer efforts.(2) Appropriateness and potential effectiveness of the Program in producingtechnology transfer to the target industries. Where the service area ofthe center includes firms from other states, the approach for linking withthese states to serve these markets should be detailed.(3) Appropriateness of national audience; i.e., identification, and analysisof national audience that would be most usefully served.(4) Appropriateness and effectiveness of the center's programs, plans,and mechanisms (e.g., plan for allocating intellectual property rights)for producing technology transfer to a larger national audience.(5) Budget, personnel, and facility allocations to the program activities.(d) Regional Relationships(1) Demonstrated linkages with regional/state/local economic developmentand extension organizations.(2) Demonstrated linkages with regional industrial, educational, and trainingorganizations.(3) Demonstrated interest of the region (local, state, industrial, or otherentities) in improving its manufacturing capabilities.(4) Geographic location of the proposed center vis-a-vis the concentrationof target industries, the location of other centers and similar Programsand the technical focus of the other centers.(e) Organization and Management Staff(1) Appropriateness of the legal and organizational structure proposedfor facilitating technology transfer.(2) Appropriateness of the full-time staffing levels of management andtechnical personnel, and the quality of this staff's manufacturing, marketing,and technology transfer experience.(3) Record among the management team for attracting top personnel and forraising funds with industry, industrial associations, and state/local governmentalbodies.(4) Record of the management team in building successful organizationsand the team's commitment to technology transfer.(f) Funding(1) Stability and duration of the Applicant's matching funding commitments.(2) Percent of operating costs guaranteed by the Applicant.(3) Ability to continue to operate when NBS funds terminate.The enumerated criteria will be equally weighted. To be considered foran Operating Award, a proposal must receive at least 70 percent of theevaluation points from each of the categories above.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Requirements</ITAG>Applicants are reminded that a false statement may be grounds for denialor termination of funds and grounds for possible punishment by a fine orimprisonment. Except where declared by law or approved by the head of agency,no award of Federal funds shall be made to an applicant who is delinquenton a Federal debt until the delinquent account is made current or satisfactoryarrangements are made between affected agencies and the debtor.
