In addition to the ship's 28-member crew, about 25 workers wereon board the green-and-white vessel for cleaning and maintenancework, officials said.   Many of those injured suffered severe burns. The force of theexplosion also shattered windows in stores and offices aroundPerama.   Harbor authorities in the industrial port 10 miles west ofAthens ruled out the possibility of a terrorist attack.   Instead, they theorized the explosion on board the 86,000-tonAnangel Greatness may have been caused by gas fumes left in thevessel's empty tanks.   Investigators speculate welders working on the ship duringroutine maintenance and cleaning may have ignited the 10:15 a.m.blast.   The explosion came less than two months after Arab terroristslaunched a gun-and-grenade attack aboard the City of Poros cruiseship as it returned from a one-day Greek island hopping tour. Ninepeople were killed and more than 80 others were injured in thatassault.   ``We felt a series of sudden blinding explosions that threw usto different parts of the ship,'' said Evangelos Polychronakis, 38,who was working aboard the tanker at the time of the blast.   ``As the deck blew up, large chunks of metal went hurtling intothe air. I tried to get out from inside one of the tanks I wasworking in and then jumped into the sea,'' he said.   ``When the explosion occurred I was at the bottom of one of thetanks,'' said Andreas Varisis, 27. ``Sea water gushed into the shipas it ripped apart and I rose with it inside the tank, tryingdeperately to find some way out.''   The skipper of the Anangel, Capt. Anastasios Theocharis, saidthe vessel had been certified free of gas before it sailed intoPerama for repairs Monday.   Merchant Marine Ministry officials said the ship carrieddocuments showing all gas had been removed.   ``I was in the control room at the stern when I heard atremendous noise and everything clattered to the deck,'' Theocharissaid.   Harbor authorities identified two of the dead as TheodosisVorisis and Aristides Daskalakis. Fragments of what appeared to befive other bodies were also found, said a Perama police officer whodemanded anonymity.   ``People were tossed all over the place. There were dismemberedbodies landing on the deck of another tanker berthed next to thisone,'' said Costas Sakaros, a metalworkers' union official.   The force of the explosion also shattered windows in stores andoffices around Perama.</TEXT></DOC>
