Where a synergism does exist and where acquired facilities complement each other, then the resulting economy and productivity of the merged facilities more than justify the action taken. Those acquisitions forced by outsiders obviously are motivated by speculators who have seized on the opportunity to drive up the stock values of a company whose objectives are long-range and whose stock values may be understated in the market. The result is either (a) acquiring the highly leveraged company and then selling off the pieces, or (b) enjoying a nice upward ride on the stock and then enjoying the fruits of &quot;greenmail.&quot;    It might be said that this activity is a byproduct of a relatively unrestricted, free-rolling stock market and that placing restrictions inhibiting this activity would do great harm to our economic system. To the contrary, the flurry of unfriendly LBOs that we have witnessed in the past several years has resulted in great damage to the U.S. enterprise system. The leading players of unfriendly LBOs possess no known expertise that would lead a company to higher productivity or efficiency. They have used the stock market as a gambling casino and they have profited handsomely while companies which they pursue either load themselves with debt or fall victim to be sold in bits and pieces.    The role of the stock market is to provide a vehicle for individuals and companies to raise equity funds for purposes of expansion and technology improvement and at the same time provide the investor an opportunity to profit from his commitment through stock appreciation and/or dividend return. The American public is belatedly recognizing that corporate raiders provide no real value to our economic machines other than to offer short-term profits to specific shareholders. They more often &quot;cut and run&quot; leaving behind a company loaded with debt. The market must clean up its act or run the risk of diminishing its role of providing fuel for the capitalistic engine. Our economy is too valuable a machine to allow the working assets to fall prey to today's corporate raiders. It deserves investment opportunities that will provide the real growth and productivity that this nation needs if it plans to compete successfully into the 21st century.
