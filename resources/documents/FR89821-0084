Process for Making National Coverage Decisions</ITAG>The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is responsible for administeringthe Medicare program, a program which pays for health care and relatedservices for 33 million Medicare beneficiaries. Under the Medicare program,the benefits available to eligible beneficiaries are called ``covered''services and include those medical supplies, treatment procedures and technologiesthat often have been referred to as ``items.'' Throughout this notice,the term ``services'' refers to both services and items.Except in circumstances specified in the statute, Medicare program fundscannot be used to pay for services furnished to Medicare beneficiariesthat are not covered under the Social Security Act (the Act). Additionally,section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act prohibits payment under the Medicare programfor any expense incurred for services ``which are not reasonable and necessaryfor the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioningof a malformed body member.''The coverage decisions listed in the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual andthis notice constitute ``national coverage determination[s],'' as providedfor in sections 1869(b)(3) and 1871(a)(2) of the Act. HCFA uses the terms``national coverage decision'' and ``national coverage determination''interchangeably. These sections of the Act address issuance, publication,and administrative and judicial review of national coverage decisions.In the absence of national coverage decisions, local Medicare contractorshave the discretion to determine whether a particular service that meetsall other requirements for coverage appears to be reasonable and necessaryand therefore covered under Medicare.The process by which national coverage decisions would be made and thecriteria for these decisions are described in a proposed rule publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 30, 1989 (54 FR 4302). (We are currentlyconsidering public comments on that proposed rule and are developing thefinal rule that will be published in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The statutory basis for all national coveragedecisions in the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual is section 1862(a)(1)(A)of the Act (the ``not reasonable and necessary'' exclusion) unless otherwisespecified. If a decision to exclude or limited a service is imposed underanother statutory authority, that statutory basis for exclusion or limitationconstitutes the sole basis for that decision, unless otherwise specified.The section 1862(a)(1)(A) exclusion is applicable only if no other statutorybasis for exclusion applies.In addition to the national coverage decisions that have been publishedin the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual (HCFA Pub. 6), others have beenpublished in Part 3 of the Intermediary (HCFA Pub. 13-3) and Carriers (HCFAPub. 14-3) manuals, as well as in regulations, rulings and <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices. Many of these same national coveragedecisions also have been repeated in the program manuals issued to Medicareproviders. Those manuals include: Outpatient Physical Therapy Providerand CORF (HCFA Pub. 9), Hospital (HCFA Pub. 10), Home Health Agency (HCFAPub. 11), SNF (HCFA Pub. 12), Hospice (HCFA Pub. 21), and Renal DialysisFacility (HCFA Pub. 29).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose of this General Notice</ITAG>This notice lists those current Medicare national coverage decisions issuedin the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual, which we have included as an appendix.All future revisions to the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual will be publishedin the Federal Register as general notices on a quarterly basis.An individual or organization interested in receiving the Medicare CoverageIssues Manual (HCFA Pub. 6) and revisions to it may purchase a subscriptionby contacting either:<ITAG tagnum="15">Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington,DC 20402, (Telephone (202) 783-3238)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">  or<ITAG tagnum="15">National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,5825 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161, (Telephone (703) 487-4630).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Authority: Section 1102, 1862, 1869 and 1871 of the Social SecurityAct (42 U.S.C. 1302, 1395(ff), 1395(hh) and 1395(y)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 13.773, Medicare_HospitalInsurance and Program 13.774, Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Louis B.

National coveragedecisions have been made on the items addressed in this manual. All decisionsthat items, services, etc. are not covered are based on andSection; 1862(a)(1)of the Social Security Act (the ``not reasonable and necessary'' exclusion)unless otherwise specifically noted. Where another statutory authorityfor denial is indicated, that is the sole authority for denial. Where anitem, service, etc. is stated to be <T3>covered, </T3>but such coverage is explicitly limited to specifiedindications or specified circumstances, all limitations on coverage ofthe items or services because they do not meet those specified indicationsor circumstances are based on andSection; 1862(a)(1) of the Act. Where coverageof an item or service is provided for specified indications or circumstancesbut is not explicitly excluded for others, or where the item or serviceis not mentioned at all in this Manual, the Intermediary Manual, or theCarriers Manual, it is up to the Medicare contractor to make the coveragedecision, in consultation with its medical staff, and with the Health CareFinancing Administration (HCFA) when appropriate, based on the law, regulations,rulings and general program instruction.B. <T3>Contents and Organization.</T3>_1. <T3>Contents.</T3>_The statutory and policy framework within which coveragedecisions are made may be found in title XVIII of the Social Security Act,and in Medicare regulations, rulings, and other instructions of HCFA issuedunder its authority, including this manual and the Intermediary and CarriersManuals. Certain sections may include cross-references to specific sectionsof the statute, regulations, or other Medicare manuals.The coverage decisions in the manual will be kept current, based on themost recent medical and other scientific and technical advice availableto HCFA.2. <T3>Organization.</T3>_The material is organized by categories, e.g., MedicalProcedures, Supplies, Diagnostic Services. A Table of Contents is providedat the beginning of the manual designating coverage decision categories.Each subject discussed within the category is listed and identified bya number.Revisions to the manual are issued through new pages; the reader is notasked to pencil-in changes in the text. Changed material will be indicatedin the left margin of a page in the following manner:Line on which change begins.Line on which change ends.The revision transmittal sheet identifies new material and summarizes theprincipal changes. When a change in policy or procedure is involved, thebackground and effective date for the change is provided. If, at a laterdate, you wish to refer to the background explanation given on a transmittalsheet, you can identify the transmittal by its number which appears oneach manual page.C. <T3>Use of the Revision Transmittal Check Sheet.</T3>_Immediately afterthe title page, there is a check sheet on which receipt of revisions canbe recorded. Revised manual transmittals should be filed in transmittalnumber order to avoid discarding a more recent page in favor of an olderone.If it appears that you have not received a particular transmittal, allow10 working days after receipt of a higher numbered transmittal before requestinga transmittal that is missing. Transmittals are not always distributedin strict numerical sequence.D. <T3>Effective Dates for Medicare Coverage Issues Manual Issuances.</T3>_Manualtransmittals specify whether the material involves a new policy or procedure,a change, or simply a clarification of existing policies or procedures.For a new or changed policy or procedure, the transmittals and the manualtext specify the effective date. It usually carries prospective dates.However, a policy or procedural issuance which corrects a prior instructionmay be given retroactive effect, as specified on the transmittal. A clarificationis intended to improve the understanding of policies/procedures that arealready in effect, and an effective date is not specified.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Coverage Issues</T4><H1>

This procedure utilizes a machine which produces ultrasonic waves of highintensity and frequency that selectively irradiate certain portions ofthe inner ear thereby destroying the tissue. The procedure is usually doneunder local anesthesia, and requires the services of a surgeon and anotherindividual who is responsible for calibrating the electrical equipment,and who assists in observing certain physical changes (e.g., movement ofthe eyes, ``nystagmus'') indicative of inner ear reaction to the ultrasonicdestruction. Except in rare instances the desired result is achieved withone treatment. At present, there are two different approaches being usedto apply the ultrasound to the inner ear: one through the lateral semicircularcanal and, more recently, a simpler approach from a technical viewpoint,through the round window. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-5 CELLULAR THERAPY_NOT COVERED </ITAG>Cellular therapy involves the practice of injecting humans with foreignproteins like the placenta or lungs of unborn lambs. Cellular therapy iswithout scientific or statistical evidence to document its therapeuticefficacy and, in fact, is considered a potentially dangerous practice.Accordingly, cellular therapy is not considered reasonable and necessarywithin the meaning of section 1862(a)(1) of the law. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-6 THERMOGENIC THERAPY_NOT COVERED </ITAG>Thermogenic therapy which is the production of artificial fever has beenin use since 1919 in the treatment of certain types of resistant infectiousdiseases, rheumatoid arthritis and Sydenham's chorea. Regardless of themedium by which the fever is induced, this modality is not scientificallyaccepted for the treatment of any specific disease. Since the advent ofpotent antibiotics, the procedure has for all practical purposes been replacedas a mode of treatment. Therefore, thermogenic therapy is not consideredreasonable and necessary for the treatment of an illness or injury as requiredby section 1862(a)(1) of the law. (Of course, where other <T3>covered </T3>services are needed and it would be reasonable and necessarythat they be furnished on an inpatient hospital basis, payment would notbe excluded for the inpatient stay, notwithstanding the fact that reimbursementmay not be made for thermogenic therapy furnished during the hospital stay.)<ITAG tagnum="81">35-7 CAROTID BODY RESECTION/CAROTID BODY DENERVATION </ITAG>Carotid body resection is occasionally used to relieve pulmonary symptoms,including asthma, but has been shown to lack general acceptance of theprofessional medical community. In addition, controlled clinical studiesestablishing the safety and effectiveness of this procedure are needed.Therefore, all carotid body resections to relieve pulmonary symptoms mustbe considered investigational and cannot be considered reasonable and necessarywithin the meaning of section 1862(a)(1) of the law. No program reimbursementmay be made in such cases. There is, however, one instance where carotid body resection has been acceptedby the medical community as effective. That instance is when evidence ofa mass in the carotid body, <T3>with or without symptoms, </T3>indicates the need for surgery of removethe carotid body tumor. Denervation of a carotid sinus to treat hypersensitive carotid sinus reflexis another procedure performed in the area of the carotid body. In thecase of hypersensitive carotid sinus, light pressure on the upper partof the neck (such as might be experienced when turning or raising one'shead) results in symptoms such as dizziness or syncope due to hypotensionand slowed heart rate. Failure of medical therapy and continued deteriorationin the condition of the patient in such cases may indicate need for surgery.Denervation of the carotid sinus is rarely performed, but when electedas the therapy of choice with the above indications, this procedure maybe considered reasonable and necessary. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-8 ACUPUNCTURE_NOT COVERED </ITAG>Although acupuncture has been used for thousands of years in China andfor decades in parts of Europe, it is a new agent of unknown use and efficacyin the United States.

Three units of the National Institutesof Health, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NationalInstitute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, and Fogarty InternationalCenter have been designed to assess and identify specific opportunitiesand needs for research attending the use of acupuncture for surgical anesthesiaand relief of chronic pain. Until the pending scientific assessment ofthe technique has been completed and its efficacy has been established,Medicare reimbursement for acupuncture, as an anesthetic or as an analgesicor for other therapeutic purposes may not be made.

The condition giving rise to the patient'spreoperative appearance is generally not a consideration. The only exceptionto the exclusion is surgery for the prompt repair of an accidental injuryor for the improvement of a malformed body member which coincidentiallyserves some cosmetic purpose. Since surgery to correct a condition of ``moonface'' which developed as a side effect of cortisone therapy does not meetthe exception to the exclusion, it is not covered under Medicare (andSection;1862(a)(10) of the Act).

When a physician contactshis patient's relatives or associates for this purpose, expenses of suchinterviews are properly chargeable as physician's services to the patienton whose behalf the information was secured. If the beneficiary is notan inpatient of a hospital, Part B reimbursement for such an interviewis subject to the special limitation on payments for physicians' servicesin connection with mental, psychoneurotic, and personality disorders. A physician may also have contacts with a patient's family and associatesfor purposes other than securing background information. In some cases,the physician will provide counseling to members of the household. Familycounseling services are covered only where the primary purpose of suchcounseling is the treatment of the patient's condition. For example, twosituations where family counseling services would be approprite are asfollows: (1) where there is a need to observe the patient's interactionwith family members; and/or (2) where there is a need to assess the capabilityof and assist the family members in aiding in the management of the patient.Counseling principally concerned with the effects of the patient's conditionon the individual being interviewed would not be reimbursable as part ofthe physician's personal services to the patient. While to a limited degree,the counseling described in the second situation may be used to modifythe behavior of the family members, such services nevertheless are coveredbecause they relate primarily to the management of the patient's problemsand not to the treatment of the family member's problems.Cross refer: HCFA-Pub. 13-3, andSection; 3212(1); HCFA-Pub. 14-3, andSection;andSection;2020, 2470-2476.2; HCFA-Pub. 10, andSection; 160.1 <ITAG tagnum="81">35-15 POSTURAL DRAINAGE PROCEDURES AND PULMONARY EXERCISES </ITAG>In most cases postural drainage procedures and pulmonary exercises canbe carried out safely and effectively by nursing personnel. However, insome cases patients may have acute or severe pulmonary conditions involvingcomplex situations in which these procedures or exercises require the knowledgeand skills of a physical therapist or a respiratory therapist. Therefore,if the attending physician determines as part of his plan of treatmentthat for the safe and effective administration of such services the proceduresor exercises in question need to be performed by a <T3>physical therapist, </T3>the services of such a therapist would constitutecovered physical therapy when provided as an inpatient hospital service,extended care service, home health service, or outpatient physical therapyservice.

Since the services ofa respiratory therapist are not covered under the home health benefit,payment may not be made under the home health benefit for visits by a respiratorytherapist to a patient's home to provide such services. Postural drainageprocedures and pulmonary exercises are also covered when furnished by aphysical therapist or a respiratory therapist as incident to a physician'sprofessional service.

Medicare payment may be made for (1) Simple vitrectomy (i.e., removal ofvitreous humor and replacement with saline whenever there is loss of vitreous),an accepted routine procedure performed incident to cataract surgery, andwhich prevents postoperative complications, and (2) Complex vitrectomy,as used in cases involving opaque vitreous and secondary retinal detachments.<ITAG tagnum="81">35-17 INDUCED LESIONS OF NERVE TRACTS </ITAG>Surgically induced lesions of nerve tracts, which involve destruction ofnerve tissue, are primarily indicated for controlling the chronic or acutepain arising from conditions such as terminal cancer or lumbar degenerativearthritis. Induced lesions of nerve tracts may be produced by surgicalcutting of the nerve (rhizolysis), chemical destruction of the nerve, orby creation of a radio-frequency lesion (electrocautery). Accordingly,program payment may be made for these denervation procedures when usedin selected cases (concurred in by contractor's medical staff) to treatchronic pain. It should be noted that these procedures differ from those employing implantedelectrodes and associated equipment to control pain in that the nerve fibersare ablated rather than stimulated and no electronic equipment is requiredby the patient after the operation. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-18 ELECTROSLEEP THERAPY_NOT COVERED </ITAG>Electrosleep therapy consists of the application of short duration, low-amplitudepulses of direct current to the patient's brain via externally placed occipitalelectrodes. It is commonly used in the treatment of chronic insomnia, anxiety,and depression, but has also been used for psychosomatic disorders suchas asthma, spastic colitis, or tension headache, and for organic disordersincluding essential hypertension.

Cross refer: andSection;andSection; 35-27, 65-8 <ITAG tagnum="81">35-21 INPATIENT HOSPITAL PAIN REHABILITATION PROGRAMS </ITAG>Pain rehabilitation programs are a relatively new and innovative approachto the treatment of intractable pain. The goal of such programs is to givea patient the tools to manage and control his pain, and thereby improvehis ability to function independently. A hospital level pain rehabilitation program is one that employs a coordinatedmultidisciplinary team to deliver, in a controlled environment, a concentratedprogram which is designed to modify pain behavior through the treatmentof the physiological, psychological, and social aspects of pain. Such programsgenerally include diagnostic testing, skilled nursing, psychotherapy, structuredprogressive withdrawal from pain medications, physical therapy and occupationaltherapy to restore physical fitness (mobility and endurance) to a maximallevel within the constraints of a patient's physical disability, and theuse of mechanical devices and/or activities to relieve pain or modify apatient's reaction to it (e.g., nerve stimulator, hydrotherapy, massage,ice, systemic muscle relaxation training, and diversional activities).The nurse's responsibility in such pain rehabilitation programs is to observeand assess, on a continuing basis, a patient's condition and response tothe program as reflected by his actions while in the nursing unit, andto assure that the atmosphere within the unit is not supportive of painbehavior. The day-to-day activities involved in carrying out the programare under the general supervision and, as needed, direct supervision ofa physician. Since pain rehabilitation programs of a lesser scope than that describedabove would raise a question as to whether the program could be providedin a less intensive setting than on an inpatient hospital basis, carefullyevaluate such programs to determine whether the program does, in fact,necessitate a hospital level of care. Some pain rehabilitation programsmay utilize services and devices which are excluded from coverage, e.g.,acupuncture (see andSection; 35-8), biofeedback (see andSection; 35-27), dorsalcolumn stimulator (see andSection; 65-8), and family counseling services(see andSection; 35-14). In determining whether the scope of a pain programdoes necessitate inpatient hospital care, evaluate only those servicesand devices which are covered. Although diagnostic tests may be an appropriatepart of pain rehabilitation programs, such tests would be covered in anindividual case only where they can be reasonably related to a patient'sillness, complaint, symptom, or injury and where they do not representan unnecessary duplication of tests previously performed. An inpatient program of 4 weeks' duration is generally required to modifypain behavior. After this period it would be expected that any additionalrehabilitation services which might be required could be effectively providedon an outpatient basis under an outpatient pain rehabilitation program(see andSection; 35-21.1) or other outpatient program. The first 7-10 daysof such an inpatient program constitute, in effect, an evaluation period.If a patient is unable to adjust to the program within this period, itis generally concluded that it is unlikely that the program will be effectiveand the patient is discharged from the program. On occasions a programlonger than 4 weeks may be required in a particular case. In such a casethere should be documentation to substantiate that inpatient care beyonda 4-week period was reasonable and necessary. Similarly, where it appearsthat a patient participating in a program is being granted frequent outsidepasses, a question would exist as to whether an inpatient program is reasonableand necessary for the treatment of the patient's condition. An inpatient hospital stay for the purpose of participating in a pain rehabilitationprogram would be covered as reasonable and necessary to the treatment ofa patient's condition where the pain is attributable to a physical cause,the usual methods of treatment have not been successful in alleviatingit, and a significant loss of ability to function independently has resultedfrom the pain. Chronic pain patients often have psychological problemswhich accompany or stem from the physical pain and it is appropriate toinclude psychological treatment in the multidisciplinary approach. However,patients whose pain symptoms result from a mental condition, rather thanfrom any physical cause, generally cannot be successfully treated in apain rehabilitation program.<ITAG tagnum="81">35-21.1 OUTPATIENT HOSPITAL PAIN REHABILITATION PROGRAMS</ITAG>Some hospitals also provide pain rehabilitation programs for outpatients.In such programs, services frequently are provided in group settings eventhough they are being furnished pursuant to each patient's individualizedplan of treatment.Coverage of services furnished under outpatient hospital pain rehabilitationprograms, including services furnished in group settings under individualizedplans of treatment, is available if the patient's pain is attributableto a physical cause, the usual methods of treatment have not been successfulin alleviating it, and a significant loss of ability by the patient tofunction independently has resulted from the pain. If a patient meets theseconditions and the program provides services of the types discussed inandSection;35-21 the services provided under the program may be covered.Noncovered services (e.g., vocational counseling, meals for outpatients,or acupuncture) continue to be excluded from coverage, and intermediarieswould not be precluded from finding, in the case of particular patients,that the pain rehabilitation program is not reasonable and necessary underandSection;1862(a)(1) of the law for the treatment of their conditions.<ITAG tagnum="81">35-22 INPATIENT HOSPITAL STAYS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLISM</ITAG>A. <T3>Inpatient Hospital Stay for Alcohol Detoxification.</T3>_Many hospitalsprovide detoxification services during the more actute stages of alcoholismor alcohol withdrawal. When the high probability or occurrence of medicalcomplications (e.g., delirium, confusion, trauma, or unconsciousness) duringdetoxification for acute alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal necessitatesthe constant availability of physicians and/or complex medical equipmentfound only in the hospital setting, inpatient hospital care during thisperiod is considered reasonable and necessary and is therefore coveredunder the program. Generally, detoxification can be accomplished within2-3 days with an occasional need for up to 5 days where the patient's conditiondictates. This limit (5 days) may be extended in an individual case wherethere is a need for a longer period for detoxification for a particularpatient. In such cases, however, there should be documentation by a physicianwhich substantiates that a longer period of detoxification was reasonableand necessary. When the detoxification needs of an individual no longerrequire an inpatient hospital setting, coverage should be denied on thebasis that inpatient hospital care is not reasonable and necessary as requiredby section 1862(a)(1) of the law. Following detoxification a patient maybe transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation unit or discharged to a residentialtreatment program or outpatient treatment setting.B. <T3>Inpatient Hospital Stay for Alcohol Rehabilitation.</T3>_Hospitalsmay also provide structured inpatient alcohol rehabilitation programs tothe chronic alcoholic. These programs are composed primarily of coordiantededucational and psychotherapeutic services provided on a group basis. Dependingon the subject matter, a series of lectures, discussions, films, and grouptherapy sessions are led by either physicians, psychologists, or alcoholismcounselors from the hospital or various outside organizations. In addition,individual psychotherapy and family counseling (see andSection;35-14) maybe provided in selected cases. These programs are conducted under the supervisionand direction of a physician. Patients may directly enter an inpatienthospital rehabilitation program after having undergone detoxification inthe same hospital or in another hospital or may enter an inpatient hospitalrehabilitation program without prior hospitalization for detoxification.Alcohol rehabilitation can be provided in a variety of settings other thanthe hospital setting. In order for an inpatient hospital stay for alcoholrehabilitation to be covered under Medicare it must be medically necessaryfor the care to be provided in the inpatient hospital setting rather thanin a less costly facility or on an outpatient basis. Inpatient hospitalcare for receipt of an alcohol rehabilitation program would generally bemedically necessary where either (1) there is documentation by the physicianthat recent alcohol rehabilitation services in a less intensive settingor on an outpatient basis have proven unsuccessful and, as a consequence,the patient requires the supervision and intensity of services which canonly be found in the controlled environment of the hospital, <T3>or</T3> (2) only the hospital environment can assure the medical managementor control of the patient's concomitant conditions during the course ofalcohol rehabilitation. (However, a patient's concomitant condition maymake the use of certain alcohol treatment modalities medically inappropriate.)In addition, the ``active treatment'' criteria (see HCFA-Pub. 13-3, andSection;3102.1or HCFA-Pub. 10, andSection;212.1) should be applied to psychiatric carein the general hospital as well as to psychiatric care in a psychiatrichospital. Since alcoholism is classifiable as a psychiatric condition the``active treatment'' criteria must also be met in order for alcohol rehabilitationservices to be covered under Medicare. (Thus, it is the combined need for``active treatment'' and for covered care <T3>which can only be provided in the inpatient hospital setting,</T3>rather than the fact that rehabilitation immediately follows a period ofdetoxification, which provides the basis for coverage of inpatient hospitalalcohol rehabilitation programs.)Generally 16-19 days of rehabilitation services are sufficient to bringa patient to a point where care could be continued in other than an inpatienthospital setting. An inpatient hospital stay for alcohol rehabilitationmay be extended beyond this limit in an individual case where a longerperiod of alcohol rehabilitation is medically necessary. In such cases,however, there should be documentation by a physician which substantiatesthe need for such care. Where the rehabilitation needs of an individualno longer require an inpatient hospital setting, coverage should be deniedon the basis that inpatient hospital care is not reasonable and necessaryas required by section 1862(a)(1) of the law.Subsequent admissions to the inpatient hospital setting for alcohol rehabilitationfollowup, reinforcement, or ``recap'' treatments are considered to be readmissions(rather than an extension of the original stay) and must meet the requirementsof this section for coverage under Medicare. Prior admissions to the inpatienthospital setting_either in the same hospital or in a different hospital_maybe an indication that the ``active treatment'' requirements are not met(i.e., there is no reasonable expectation of improvement) and the stayshould not be covered. Accordingly, there should be documentation to establishthat ``readmission'' to the hospital setting for alcohol rehabilitationservices can reasonably be expected to result in improvement of the patient'scondition. For example, the documentation should indicate what changesin the patient's medical condition, social or emotional status, or treatmentplan make improvement likely, or why the patient's initial hospital treatmentwas not sufficient.C. <T3>Combined Alcohol Detoxification/Rehabilitation Programs.</T3>_Fiscalintermediaries should apply the guidelines in A. and B. above to both phasesof a combined inpatient hospital alcohol detoxification/rehabilitationprogram. Not all patients who require the inpatient hospital setting fordetoxification also need the inpatient hospital setting for rehabilitation.(See andSection;35-22.1 for coverage of outpatient hospital alcohol rehabilitationservices.) Where the inpatient hospital setting is medically necessaryfor both alcohol detoxification and rehabilitation, generally a 3-weekperiod is reasonable and necessary to bring the patient to the point wherecare can be continued in other than an inpatient hospital setting.Decisions regarding reasonableness and necessity of treatment, the needfor an inpatient hospital level of care, and length of treatment shouldbe made by intermediaries based on accepted medical practice with the adviceof their medical consultant. (In hospitals under PSRO review, PSRO determinationsof medical necessity of services and appropriateness of the level of careat which services are provided are binding on the title XVIII fiscal intermediariesfor purposes of adjudicating claims for payment.)<ITAG tagnum="81">35-22.1 OUTPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES FOR TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLISM</ITAG>Some hospitals also provide services on an outpatient basis, either individuallyor as part of a day hospitalization program, for treatment of alcoholism.These services may include, for example, drug therapy, psychotherapy, andpatient education and may be furnished by physicians, psychologists, nurses,and alcoholism counselors to individuals who have been discharged froman inpatient hospital stay for treatment of alcoholism and require continuedtreatment or to individuals from the community who require treatment butdo not require the inpatient hospital setting.Coverage is available for both diagnostic and therapeutic services furnishedfor the treatment of alcoholism by the hospital to outpatients subjectto the same rules applicable to outpatient hospital services in general(see HCFA-Pub. 13-3, andSection;andSection; 3312 ff.; HCFA-Pub. 10, andSection;andSection;230 ff.). While there is no coverage for day hospitalization programs,per se, individual services which meet the requirements in HCFA-Pub. 13-3,andSection;andSection; 3112 ff. or HCFA-Pub. 10, andSection;andSection; 230 ff.may be covered. (Meals, transportation and recreational and social activitiesdo not fall within the scope of covered outpatient hospital services underMedicare.)All services must be reasonable and necessary for diagnosis or treatmentof the patient's condition (see HCFA-Pub. 13-3, andSection; 3151, HCFA-Pub.10, andSection; 260.1). Thus, educational services and family counselingwould only be covered where they are directly related to treatment of thepatient's condition. (See also andSection; 35-14.) The frequency of treatmentand period of time over which it occurs must also be reasonable and necessary.<ITAG tagnum="81">35-22.2 TREATMENT OF DRUG ABUSE (CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY)</ITAG>We recognize that there are similarities between the approach to treatmentof drug abuse and alcohol detoxification and rehabilitation. However, theintensity and duration of treatment for drug abuse may vary (dependingon the particular substance(s) of abuse, duration of use, and the patient'smedical and emotional condition) from the duration of treatment or intensityneeded to treat alcoholism. Accordingly, when it is medically necessaryfor a patient to receive detoxification and/or rehabilitation for drugsubstance abuse as a hospital inpatient, coverage for care in that settingis available. Coverage is also available for treatment services that areprovided in the outpatient department of a hospital to patients who, forexample, have been discharged from an inpatient stay for the treatmentof drug substance abuse or who require treatment but do not require theavailability and intensity of services found only in the inpatient hospitalsetting. The coverage available for these services is subject to the samerules generally applicable to the coverage of outpatient hospital services.(See HCFA-Pub. 13-3, andSection;andSection; 3112 ff.; HCFA-Pub. 10, andSection;andSection;230 ff.). The services must also be reasonable and necessary for treatmentof the individual's condition. (See HCFA-Pub. 13-3, andSection; 3151; HIM-10,andSection; 260.1.) Decisions regarding reasonableness and necessity of treatment,the need for an inpatient hospital level of care, and length of treatmentshould be made by intermediaries based on accepted medical practice withthe advice of their medical consultant. (In hospitals under PSRO review,PSRO determinations of medical necessity of services and appropriatenessof the level of care at which services are provided are binding on thetitle XVIII fiscal intermediaries for purposes of adjudicating claims forpayment.)<ITAG tagnum="81">35-22.3 TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLISM AND DRUG ABUSE IN A FREESTANDING CLINIC</ITAG>Coverage is available for alcoholism or drug abuse treatment services (suchas drug therapy, psychotherapy, and patient education) that are providedincident to a physician's professional service in a freestanding clinicto patients who, for example, have been discharged from an inpatient hospitalstay for the treatment of alcoholism or drug abuse or to individuals whoare not in the acute stages of alcoholism or drug abuse but require treatment.The coverage available for these services is subject to the same rulesgenerally applicable to the coverage of clinic services. (See HCFA-Pub.14-3, andSection;andSection; 2020 ff., and andSection;andSection; 2050 ff.) Ofcourse, the services also must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosisor treatment of the individual's alcoholism or drug abuse. The Part B psychiatriclimitation (see HCFA-Pub. 14-3, andSection; 2470) would apply to alcoholismor drug abuse treatment services furnished by physicians to individualswho are not hospital inpatients. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-23 CHEMICAL AVERSION THERAPY FOR TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLISM</ITAG>Chemical aversion therapy is a behavior modification technique that isused in the treatment of alcoholism. Chemical aversion therapy facilitatesalcohol abstinence through the development of conditioned aversions tothe taste, smell, and sight of alcohol beverages. This is accomplishedby repeatedly pairing alcohol with unpleasant symptoms (e.g., nausea) whichhave been induced by one of several chemical agents. While a number ofdrugs have been employed in chemical aversion therapy, the three most commonlyused are emetine, apomorphine, and lithium. None of the drugs being used,however, have yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration specificallyfor use in chemical aversion therapy for alcoholism. Accordingly, whenthese drugs are being employed in conjunction with this therapy, patientsundergoing this treament need to be kept under medical observation.Available evidence indicates that chemical aversion therapy may be an effectivecomponent of certain alcoholism treatment programs, particularly as partof multimodality treatment programs which include other behavioral techniquesand therapies, such as psychotherapy. Based on this evidence, HCFA's medicalconsultants have recommended that chemical aversion therapy be coveredunder Medicare. However, since chemical aversion therapy is a demandingtherapy which may not be appropriate for all Medicare beneficiaries needingtreatment for alcoholism, a physician should certify to the appropriatenessof chemical aversion therapy in the individual case. Therefore, if chemicalaversion therapy for treatment of alcoholism is determined to be reasonableand necessary for an individual patient, it is covered under Medicare.When it is medically necessary for a patient to receive chemical aversiontherapy as a hospital inpatient, coverage for care in that setting is available.(See andSection;35-22 regarding coverage of multimodality treatment programs.)Followup treatments for chemical aversion therapy can generally be providedon an outpatient basis. Thus, where a patient is admitted as an inpatientfor receipt of chemical aversion therapy, there must be documentation bythe physician of the need in the individual case for the inpatient hospitaladmission. Decisions regarding reasonableness and necessity of treatment and the needfor an inpatient hospital level of care should be made by intermediariesbased on accepted medical practice with the advice of their medical consultant.(In hospitals under PSRO review, PSRO determinations of medical necessityof services and appropriateness of the level of care at which servicesare provided are binding on the title XVIII fiscal intermediaries for purposesof adjudicating claims for payment.) <ITAG tagnum="81">35-23.1 ELECTRICAL AVERSION THERAPY FOR TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLISM (ELECTROVERSIONTHERAPY, ELECTRO-SHOCK THERAPY, NOXIOUS FARADIC STIMULATION) </ITAG>Electrical aversion therapy is a behavior modification technique to fosterabstinence from ingestion of alcoholic beverages by developing in a patientconditioned aversions to their taste, smell and sight through electricstimulation. Electrical aversion therapy has not been shown to be safeand effective and therefore is excluded from coverage. (See also andSection;andSection;35-22,35-23, and 35-27). <ITAG tagnum="81">35-24 DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF IMPOTENCE </ITAG>Program payment may be made for diagnosis and treatment of sexual impotence.Impotence is a failure of a body part for which the diagnosis, and frequentlythe treatment, require medical expertise. Depending on the cause of thecondition, treatment may be surgical; e.g., implantation of a penile prosthesis,or nonsurgical; e.g., medical or psychotherapeutic treatment. Since causesand, therefore, appropriate treatment vary, if abuse is suspected it maybe necessary to request documentation of appropriateness in individualcases. If treatment is furnished to patients (other than hospital inpatients)in connection with a mental condition, apply the psychiatric service limitationdescribed in HCFA Pub. 14-3, andSection;2470. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-25 CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. </ITAG>A. <T3>General.</T3>_Exercise programs for cardiac patients, commonly referredto as cardiac rehabilitation programs, are increasingly being conductedin specialized, free-standing, cardiac rehabilitation clinics as well asin outpatient hospital departments. Exercise programs include specifictypes of exercise, individually prescribed for each patient. Medicare coverage of cardiac rehabilitation programs would be consideredreasonable and necessary only for patients with a clear medical need, whoare referred by their attending physician and (1) have a documented diagnosisof acute myocardial infarction within the preceding 12 months; or (2) havehad coronary bypass surgery; and/or (3) have stable angina pectoris. Cardiac rehabilitation programs may be provided either by the outpatientdepartment of a hospital or in a physician-directed clinic. Coverage foreither program would be subject to the following conditions: 1. the facility meets the definition of a hospital outpatient departmentor a physician-directed clinic, i.e., a physician is on the premises availableto perform medical duties at all times the facility is open, and each patientis under the care of a hospital or clinic physician; 2. the facility has available for immediate use all the necessary cardio-pulmonaryemergency diagnostic and therapeutic life saving equipment accepted bythe medical community as medically necessary, e.g., oxygen, cardiopulmonaryresuscitation equipment, defibrillator, etc; 3. the program is conducted in an area set aside for the exclusive useof the program while it is in session; 4. the program is staffed by personnel necessary to conduct the programsafely and effectively, who are trained in both basic and advanced lifesupport techniques and in exercise therapy for coronary disease. Servicesof nonphysician personnel must be furnished under the direct supervisionof a physician. Direct supervision means that a physician must be in theexercise program area and immediately available for an emergency at alltimes the exercise program is conducted; 5. the nonphysician personnel are employees of either the physician, hospital,or clinic conducting the program and their services are ``incident-to aphysician's professional services.'' Contractors need not undertake elaborate or costly monitoring activitiesto determine whether these requirements are met, but need only satisfythemselves to the extent that they ordinarily do in connection with, forexample, the requirements for coverage of services in physician-directedclinics (see HCFA Pub. 14-3, andSection;2050.4; HCFA Pub. 13.3, andSection;3112.4A;HCFA Pub. 10, andSection;230.4).In addition to the conditions listed above, coverage for cardiac rehabilitationprograms furnished by hospitals to outpatients would also be subject tothe rules described in HCFA Pub. 13-3, andSection;3112.4 and HCFA Pub. 10,andSection;230.4. Reasonable charge reimbursement for these services whichare performed in ``freestanding'' clinics would be subject to the limitationsset forth in HCFA Pub. 14-3, andSection;5241.B. <T3>Diagnostic Testing._Stress Testing. </T3>A prospective candidate fora cardiac rehabilitation program must be evaluated for his suitabilityto participate. A valuable diagnostic test for this purpose is the stresstest. The program need not necessarily perform the stress test, but mayaccept one performed by the patient's attending physician. Stress testingperformed in the outpatient department of a hospital or in a physician-directedclinic may be covered when reasonable and necessary for:1. evaluation of chest pain, especially atypical chest pain;2. development of exercise prescriptions for patients with known cardiacdisease;3. pre and postoperative evaluation of patients undergoing coronary arterybypass procedures.Refer to Section E, Utilization Screens, for the acceptable frequency ofstress testing performed during an individual's exercise program.<T3>ECG Rhythm Strips. </T3>ECG rhythm strips (and other ECG monitoring)constitute an important and necessary procedure which should be done perodicallywhile a cardiac patient is engaged in a physician-controlled exercise program.See Section E, Utilization Screens, for allowable screens.C. <T3>Other Diagnostic and Therapeutic Services._</T3>A freestanding or hospitalbased cardiac rehabilitation clinic may also provide diagnostic and theraputicservices other than stress testing and ECG monitoring. Any such other servicesmust meet the usual coverage requirements for the specific service, e.g.,the incident-to, and reasonable and necessary requirements.1. <T3>Psychotherapy and Psychological Testing._</T3>It would not normallybe considered reasonable and necessary to provide psychotherapy to allcardiac rehabilitation patients, or even to test all such patients to determinewhether they may have a mental, psychoneurotic, or personality disorder.However, where a patient has a diagnosed mental, psychoneurotic, or personalitydisorder, psychotherapy furnished by a psychiatrist_or by a psychologistrendering such services incident to a physician's professional service_maybe covered. Similarly, diagnostic testing of a cardiac rehabilitation patientfor a mental problem may be covered where the patient shows appropriatesymptoms, e.g., excessive anxiety or fear associated with the cardiac disease.2. <T3>Physical and Occupational Therapy._</T3>Physical therapy and occupationaltherapy would not be covered when furnished in connection with cardiacrehabilitation exercise program services covered under this section unlessthere also is a diagnosed noncardiac condition requiring such therapy,e.g., where a patient who is just recuperating from an acute phase of heartdisease may have had a stroke which would require physical and/or occupationaltherapy. (While the cardiac rehabilitation exercise program may by somebe considered a form of physical therapy, it is a specialized program conductedand/or supervised by specially trained personnel whose services are performedunder the direct supervision of a physician.) Restrictions on coverageof physical therapy and occupational therapy under this section do notaffect rules regarding coverage or noncoverage of such services when furnishedin a hospital inpatient or outpatient setting.(See HCFA Pub. 13-3, andSection;3101.9 and HCFA Pub. 10, andSection;210.9.)3. <T3>Patient Education Services._</T3>Many cardiac rehabilitation programsprovide health education in the form of lectures or counseling in whichpatients and/or family members are given information, e.g., on diet, nutrition,and sexual activity to assist them in adjusting their living habits becauseof the cardiac condition. However, the same kind of information would havebeen furnished to a patient and/or family members by the attending physicianfollowing the patient's acute cardiac episode. Therefore, formal lecturesand couseling on these subjects would not be considered reasonable andnecessary as a separately identifiable service when provided as part ofa cardiac rehabilitation exercise program. In addition, where a free-standingcardiac rehabilitation clinic provides board and room for the patient (andin some cases family members), these services would not be covered underMedicare.D. <T3>Duration of the Program._</T3>Services provided in connection witha cardiac rehabilitation exercise program may be considered reasonableand necessary for up to 36 sessions, usually 3 sessions a week in a single12 week period. Coverage for continued participation in cardiac exerciseprograms beyond 12 weeks would be allowed only on a case-by-case basiswith exit criteria taken into consideration.Although firm exit criteria for terminating the therapeutic outpatientexercise treatment and rehabilitation program have not been established,the following guidelines have been identified as acceptable when the patientprogresses to a maintenance program:1. The patient has achieved a stable level of exercise tolerance withoutischemia or dysrhythmia.2. Symptoms of angina or dyspnea are stable at the patient's maximum exerciselevel. 3. Patient's <T3>resting </T3>blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits.4. The stress test is not <T3>positive </T3>during exercise. (A <T3>positive test </T3>in this context implies an ECG with a junctionaldepression of 2mm or more associated with slowly rising, horizontal, ordown sloping ST segment.) Accordingly, claims for coverage of cardiac rehabilitation exercise programsbeyond 12 weeks should be reviewed by contractors' medical consultants.When claims are accompanied by acceptable documentation that the patienthas not reached an exit level, coverage may be extended, but should notexceed a maximum of 24 weeks. E. <T3>Utilization Screens.</T3>_Patients who participate in cardiac rehabilitationprograms will require certain services more frequently than other patientsbeing treated on an outpatient basis. Therefore, in order to provide coveragein a uniform manner, the following utilization screens should be implementedin addition to existing screens for any cardiac rehabilitation servicesnot listed: 1. <T3>Group 1 Services </T3>a. Continuous ECG telemetric monitoring during exercise. b. ECG rhythm strip with interpretation and physician's revisions of exerciseprescription. c. Limited examination for physician followup to adjust medication or othertreatment changes. A visit including one or more of this range of routine services would beconsidered as one routine cardiac rehabilitation visit. In order for thevisit to be reimbursable, at least one of the Group 1 services must beperformed. The same rate of reimbursement would be allowed for each visit,but not all the services need be performed at each visit. Allow a maximum of three visits per week. 2. <T3>Group 2 Services </T3>a. New patient comprehensive evaluation, including history physical, andpreparation of initial exercise prescription. Allow one at the beginning of the program if not already performed by thepatient's attending physician, or if that performed by the patient's attendingphysician is not accpetable to the program's director. b. ECG stress test (treadmill or bicycle ergometer) with physician monitoringand report. Allow one at the beginning of the program and one after 3 months (usuallythe completion of the program). c. Other physician services, as needed. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-26 TREATMENT OF OBESITY </ITAG>Obesity itself cannot be considered an illness. The immediate cause isa caloric intake which is persistently higher than caloric output. Programpayment may not be made for treatment for obesity alone since this treatmentcannot be considered reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatmentof an illness or injury. However, although obesity is not in itself anillness, it may be caused by illnesses such as hypothyroidism, Cushing'sdisease, and hypothalamic lesions. In addition, obesity can aggravate anumber of cardiac and respiratory diseases as well as diabetes and hypertension.Therefore, services in connection with the treatment of obesity could becovered services when such services are an integral and necessary partof a course of treatment for one of these illnesses. Cross refer: CIA 35-33 and 35-40. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-26.1 SUPPLEMENTED FASTING </ITAG>Supplemented fasting is a type of very low calorie weight reduction regimentused to achieve rapid weight loss. The reduced calorie intake is supplementedby a mixture of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Seriousquestions exist about the safety of prolonged adherence for 2 months ormore to a very low calorie weight reduction regimen as a general treatmentfor obesity, because of instances of cardiopathology and sudden death,as well as possible loss of body protein. Therefore, supplemented fastingis not covered as a general treatment for obesity. In cases where weight loss is necessary before surgery in order to amelioratethe complications posed by obesity when it coexists with pathological conditionssuch as cardiac and respiratory diseases, diabetes or hypertension (andother more conservative techniques to achieve this end are not regardedas appropriate), supplemented fasting with adequate monitoring of the patientmay be covered under Medicare on a case-by-case basis, as determined bythe contractor's medical consultant. The risks associated with the achievementof rapid weight loss must be carefully balanced against the risk posedby the condition requiring surgical treatment. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-27 BIOFEEDBACK THERAPY </ITAG>Biofeedback therapy provides visual, auditory or other evidence of thestatus of certain body functions so that a person can exert voluntary controlover the functions, and thereby alleviate an abnormal bodily condition.Biofeedback therapy often uses electrical devices to transform bodily signalsindicative of such functions as heart rate, blood pressure, skin temperature,salivation, peripheral vasomotor activity, and gross muscle tone into atone or light, the loudness or brightness of which shows the extent ofactivity in the function being measured. Biofeedback therapy differs from electromyography, which is a diagnosticprocedure used to record and study the electrical properties of skeletalmuscle. An electromyography device may be used to provide feedback withcertain types of biofeedback, however. Biofeedback therapy is covered under Medicare only when it is reasonableand necessary for the individual patient for muscle re-education of specificmuscle groups or for treating pathological muscle abnormalities of spasticity,incapacitating muscle spasm, or weakness, and more conventional treatments(heat, cold, massage, exercise, support) have not been successful. Thistherapy is not covered for treatment of ordinary muscle tension statesor for psychosomatic conditions. (See HCFA-Pub. 14-3, andSection;andSection;2200ff, 2215, and 4161; HCFA-Pub. 13-3, andSection;andSection; 3133.3, 3148,and 3149; HCFA-Pub. 10, andSection;andSection; 242 and 242.5 for special physicaltherapy requirements.

Hydrotherapy(whirlpool) treatment for decubitus ulcers is a coverd service under Medicarefor patients for whom this form of treatment is reasonable and necessary.Some other methods of treating decubitus ulcers, the safety and effectivenessof which have not been established, are not covered under the Medicareprogram. Some examples of these types of treatments are: ultraviolet light,low intensity direct current, topical appliction of oxygen, and topicaldressings with Balsam of Peru in castor oil. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-32 VERTEBRAL ARTERY SURGERY </ITAG>Obstructions which block the flow of blood through the vertebral arterycan cause vertigo, visual or speech defects, ataxia, mental confusion,or stroke. These symptoms in patients result from reduction in blood flowto the brain and range from symptoms of transient basilar ischemia to mentaldeterioration or completed stroke. Five types of surgical procedures are performed to relieve obstructionsto vertebral artery blood flow. They are: 1. Vertebral artery endarterectomy, a procedure which cleans out arterioscleroticplaques which are inside the vertebral artery; 2. Vertebral artery by-pass or resection with anastomosis or graft; 3. Subclavian artery resection with or without endarterectomy; 4. Removal of laterally located osteophytes anywhere in the C<T2>6</T2>(C<T2>7</T2>)-C<T2>2</T2> course of the vertebral artery; and  5. Arteriolysis which frees the artery from surrounding tissue, with orwithout arteriopexy (fixation of the vessel). These procedures can be medically reasonable and necessary, but only ifeach of the following conditions is met: 1. Symptoms of vertebral artery obstruction exist; 2. Other causes have been considered and ruled out; 3. There is radiographic evidence of a valid vertebral artery obstruction;and  4. Contraindications to the procedure do not exist, such as coexistentobstructions of multiple cerebral vessels. Angiograms documenting a valid obstruction should show not only the aorticarch with the vessels off the arch, but also show the vessels in the neckand head (providing biplane views of the carotid and vertebral vascularsystem). In addition, serial views are needed to diagnose ``subclaviansteal,'' the condition in which subclavian artery obstruction causes thesymptoms of vertebral artery obstruction. Because the symptoms are notspecific for vertebral artery obstruction, other causes must be considered.In addition to vertebral artery obstruction, the differential diagnosisshould include various degenerative disorders of the brain, orthostatichypotension, acoustic neuroma, labyrinthitis, diabetes mellitus and hypoglycemiarelated disorders. Obstructions which can cause symptoms of blocked vertebral artery bloodflow and which can be documented by an angiogram include: 1. Intravascular obstructions_arteriosclerotic lesions within the vertebralartery or in the other arteries. 2. Extravascular obstructions_ a. Bony tissue or osteophytes, located laterally in the C<T2>6</T2>(C<T2>7</T2>)-C<T2>2</T2> cervical vertebral area course of the vertebral artery, mostcommonly at C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>6</T2>. b. Anatomical variations_Anomalous location of the origin of the vertebralartery, a congenital aberration, and tortuosity and kinks of the vertebralartery. c. ``Fiberous tissue''_Tissue changed as a result of manipulation of theneck for neck pain or injury associated with hematoma; ``external bands,''``tendinous slings,'' and ``fibrous bands.'' The most controversial obstructions include vertebral artery tortuosityand kinks and connective tissue along the course of the vertebral artery,and variously called ``external bands,'' ``tendinous slings'' and ``fibrousbands.'' In the absence of symptoms of vertebral artery obstruction, vascularsurgeons feel such abnormalities are insignificant. Vascular surgery experts,however, agree that these abnormalities in very rare cases do cause symptomsof vertebral artery obstruction and do necessitate surgical correction.``Vertebral artery construction'' and ``vertebral artery surgery'' arephrases which most physicians interpret to include only surgical cleaning(endarterectomy) and bypass (resection) procedures. However, some physicianswho use these terms mean all operative manipulations which remove vertebralartery blood flow obstructions. Also, some physicians use general termsof vascular surgery, such as ``endarterectomy'' when vertebral artery relatedsurgery is performed. Use of the above terminology specifies neither thesurgical procedure performed nor its relationship to the vertebral artery.Therefore, in developing claims for this type of procedure, the Medicarecontractors should require specific identification of the obstruction inquestion and the surgical procedure performed. Also, in view of the specificcoverage criteria given above, the Medicare contractors are expected todevelop all claims for vertebral artery surgery on a case-by-case basis.Payment may be made for a surgical procedure listed above if: (1) It isreasonable and necessary for the individual patient to have the surgeryperformed to remove or relieve an obstruction to vertebral artery flow,and (2) The four conditions noted above are met. In all other cases, these procedures cannot be considered reasonable andnecessary within the meaning of andSection; 1862(a)(1) of the Medicare lawand are not reimbursable under the program.<ITAG tagnum="81">35-33 INTESTINAL BY-PASS SURGERY_NOT COVERED </ITAG>The safety of intestinal bypass surgery for treatment of obesity has notbeen demonstrated.

Ultrafiltrationis a covered procedure under the Medicare program (effective for servicesperformed on and after 9/1/79).<T3>Predialysis Ultrafiltration._</T3>While this procedure requires additionalstaff care, the facility dialysis rate is intended to cover the full rangeof complicated and uncomplicated nonacute dialysis treatments. Therefore,no additional facility charge is recognized for predialysis ultrafiltration.The physician's role in ultrafiltration varies with the stability of thepatient's condition. In unstable patients, the physician may need to bepresent at the initiation of dialysis, and available either in-house orin close proximity to monitor the patient carefully. In patients who arerelatively stable, but who seem to accumulate excessive weight gain, theprocedure requires only a modest increase in physician involvement overroutine outpatient hemodialysis.Occassionally, medical complications may occur which require that ultrafiltrationbe performed separate from the dialysis treatment, and in these cases anadditional charge can be recognized. However, the claim must be documentedas to why the ultrafiltration could not have been performed at the sametime as the dialysis.B.<T3> Hemoperfusion._</T3>A process which removes substances from the bloodusing a charcoal or resin artifical kidney. When used in the treatmentof life threatening <T3>drug overdose,</T3> hemoperfusion is a covered service for patientswith or without renal failure (effective for services performed on andafter 9/1/79). Hemoperfusion generally requires a physician to be presentto initiate treatment and to be present in the hospital or an adjacentmedical office during the entire procedure, as changes may be sudden. Specialstaff training and equipment are required. Develop charges for hemoperfusion in the same manner as for any new orunusual service. One or two treatments are usually all that is necessaryto remove the toxic compound; document additional treatments. Hemoperfusionmay be performed concurrently with dialysis, and in those cases paymentfor the hemoperfusion reflects only the additional care rendered over andabove the care which is given to the dialysis.The effects of using hemoperfusion to <T3>improve </T3>the results of <T3>chronic hemodialysis </T3>are not known. Therefore, hemoperfusion isnot a covered service when used to improve the results of hemodialysis.In addition, it has not been demonstrated that the use of hemoperfusionin conjunction with DFO, in treating symptomatic patients with iron overload,is efficacious. There is also a paucity of data regarding its efficacyin treating asymptomatic patients with iron overload. Therefore, hemoperfusionused in conjunction with DFO in treating patients with iron overload isnot a covered service; i.e., it is not considered reasonable and necessarywithin the meaning of andSection; 1862(a)(1) of the law.However, the use of hemoperfusion in conjunction with DFO for the treatmentof patients with aluminum toxicity has been demonstrated to be clinicallyefficacious and is therefore regarded as a covered service.C. <T3>Hemofiltration._</T3>A process which removes fluid, electrolytes andother low molecular weight toxic substances from the blood by filtrationthrough hollow artificial membranes and may be routinely performed in 3weekly sessions. Hemofiltration (which is also known as diafiltration)is a covered procedure under Medicare and is a safe and effective techniquefor the treatment of ESRD patients and an alternative to pertioneal dialysisand hemodialysis (effective for services performed on and after August20, 1987). In contrast to both hemodialysis and pertioneal dialysis treatments,which eliminate dissolved substances via diffusion across semipermeablemembranes, hemofiltration mimics the filtration process of the normal kidney.The technique requires an arteriovenous access. Hemofiltration may be performedeither in facility or at home.The procedure is most advantageous when applied to high-risk unstable patients,such as older patients with cardiovascular diseases or diabetes, becausethere are fewer side effects such as hypotension, hypertension or volumeoverload.Cross-refer: Intermediary Manual, andSection; 3188<ITAG tagnum="81">35-39 INTRAOCULAR PHOTOGRAPHY (EFFECTIVE FOR SERVICES FURNISHED ONOR AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 1979)</ITAG>Intraocular photography may be covered when used for the diagnosis of suchconditions as macular degeneration, retinal neoplasms, choroid disturbancesand diabetic retinopathy, or to identify glaucoma, multiple sclerosis andother central nervous system abnormalities.

However, other pulsed wave diathermymachines have been found to produce some degree of therapeutic benefitfor essentially the same conditions and to the same extent as standarddiathermy. Accordingly, where the contractor's medical staff has determinedthat the pulsed wave diathermy apparatus used is one which is consideredtherapeutically effective, the treatments are considered a covered service,but only for those conditions for which standard diathermy is medicallyindicated and only when rendered by a physician or incident to a physician'sprofessional services.

Along with the surgery, a substantialnumber of preoperative tests are available to the surgeon. In most cases,a comprehensive eye examination (ocular history and ocular examination)and a single scan to determine the appropriate pseudophakic power of theIOL are sufficient. In most cases involving a simple cataract, a diagnosticultrasound A-scan is used. For patients with a dense cataract, an ultrasoundB-scan may be used.Accordingly, where the only diagnosis is ``cataract(s),'' Medicare willnot routinely cover testing other than one comprehensive eye examination(or a combination of a brief/intermediate examination not to exceed thecharge of a comprehensive examination) and an A-scan or, if medically justified,a B-scan. Claims for additional tests will be denied as not reasonableand necessary unless there is an additional diagnosis <T3>and </T3>the medical need for the additional test is fully documented.Because cataract surgery is an elective procedure, the patient may decidenot to have the surgery until later, or to have the surgery performed bya physician other than the diagnosing physician. In these situations, itmay be medically appropriate for the operating physician to conduct anotherexamination. To the extent the additional tests are considered reasonableand necessary by the carrier's medical staff, they would be covered. B. <T3>General Anesthesia.</T3>_The use of general anesthesia in cataractsurgery may be considered reasonable and necessary if, for particular medicalindications, it is the accepted procedure among opthalmologists in thelocal community to use general anesthesia. In the claims review process,do not ``front-end'' reject any claims for the use of general anesthesiain cataract surgery. Obtain advice from your medical consultants beforedeciding whether to deny a claim involving use of general anesthesia incataract surgery.

Accordingly, program reimbursement may be made for thefollowing techniques when used to determine the potential therapeutic usefulnessof an electric nerve stimulator: A. <T3>Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS).</T3>_This techniqueinvolves attachment of a transcutaneous nerve stimulator to the surfaceof the skin over the peripheral nerve to be stimulated. It is used by thepatient on a trial basis and its effectiveness in modulating pain is monitoredby the physician, or physical therapist. Generally, the physician or physicaltherapist is able to determine whether the patient is likely to derivea significant therapeutic benefit from continuous use of a transcutaneousstimulator within a trial period of 1 month; in a few cases this determinationmay take longer to make. Document the medical necessity for such serviceswhich are furnished beyond the first month. (See andSection;45-25 for anexplanation of coverage of medically necessary supplies for the effectiveuse of TENS.) If TENS significantly alleviates pain, it may be considered as primarytreatment; if it produces no relief or greater discomfort than the originalpain, electrical nerve stimulation therapy is ruled out. However, whereTENS produces incomplete relief, further evaluation with percutaneous electricalnerve stimulation may be considered to determine whether an implanted peripheralnerve stimulator would provide significant relief from pain. (See andSection;35-46B.)Usually, the physician or physical therapist providing the services willfurnish the equipment necessary for assessment. Where the physician orphysical therapist advises the patient to rent the TENS from a supplierduring the trial period rather than supplying it himself, program paymentmay be made for rental of the TENS as well as for the services of the physicianor physical therapist who is evaluating its use. However, the combinedprogram payment which is made for the physician's or physical therapist'sservice and the rental of the stimulator from a supplier should not exceedthe amount which would be payable for the total service, including thestimulator, furnished by the physician or physical therapist alone. B. <T3>Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (PENS).</T3>_This diagnosticprocedure which involves stimulation of peripheral nerves by a needle electrodeinserted through the skin is performed only in a physician's office, clinic,or hospital outpatient department. Therefore, it is covered only when performedby a physician or incident to physician's service. If pain is effectivelycontrolled by percutaneous stimulation, implantation of electrodes is warranted.As in the case of TENS (described in subsection A), generally the physicianshould be able to determine whether the patient is likely to derive a significanttherapeutic benefit from continuing use of an implanted nerve stimulatorwithin a trial period of 1 month. In a few cases, this determination maytake longer to make. The medical necessity for such diagnostic serviceswhich are furnished beyond the first month must be documented.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_Electrical nerve stimulators do not prevent pain but onlyalleviate pain as it occurs. A patient can be taught how to employ thestimulator, and once this is done, can use it safely and effectively withoutdirect physician supervision. Consequently, it is inappropriate for a patientto visit his physician, physical therapist or an outpatient clinic on acontinuing basis for treatment of pain with electrical nerve stimulation.Once it is determined that electrical nerve stimulation should be continuedas therapy and the patient has been trained to use the stimulator, it isexpected that a stimulator will be implanted or the patient will employthe TENS on a continual basis in his home. Electrical nerve stimulationtreatments furnished by a physician in his office, by a physical therapistor outpatient clinic are excluded from coverage by andSection;1862(a)(1)of the law.

While extirpation of the disease remains ofprimary importance, the quality of life following initial treatment isincreasingly recognized as of great concern. The increased use of breastreconstruction procedures is due to several factors: andbullet; a change in epidemiology of breast cancer, include an apparentincrease in incidences; andbullet; improved surgical skills and techniques; andbullet; the continuing development of better prostheses; and andbullet; increasing awareness by physicians of the importance of postsurgicalpsychological adjustment.

Transsexualsare persons with an overwhelming desire to change anatomic sex becauseof their fixed conviction that they are members of the opposite sex. Forthe male-to-female, transsexual surgery entails castration, penectomy andvulva-vaginal construction. Surgery for the female-to-male transsexualconsists of bilateral mammectomy, hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy,which may be followed by phalloplasty and the insertion of testicular prostheses.Transsexual surgery for sex reassignment of transsexuals is controversial.Because of the lack of well controlled, long-term studies of the safetyand effectiveness of the surgical procedures and attendant therapies fortranssexualism, the treatment is considered experimental.

It consists of a rapid on-line glucose analyzer;a computer with a controller for the calculation and control of the infusionof either insulin or dextrose; a multi-channel infusion system; and a printerdesigned to record continuous glucose values and to provide cumulativetotals of the substances infused. Its primary use is for the stabilizationof Type I diabetics during periods of stress, such as trauma, labor anddelivery, and surgery, when there are wide fluctuations in blood sugarlevels. It serves to temporarily correct abnormal blood glucose level (hyper-or hypo-glycemia) and this correction is made by infusion of either insulinor dextrose. Its use is generally limited to a 24- to 48-hour period becauseof potential complications (e.g., sepsis, thromboses, and nonportability,etc.). The CBGCD requires specialized training for use and interpretationof its diagnostic and therapeutic contribution and continuous observationby specially trained medical personnel.Use of the CBGCD is covered for short-term management of insulin dependentdiabetics in crisis situations, in a hospital inpatient setting, and onlyunder the direction of specially trained medical personnel.<ITAG tagnum="81">35-71 NONSELECTIVE (RANDOM) TRANSFUSIONS AND LIVING_RELATED DONORSPECIFIC TRANSFUSIONS (DST) IN KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION._(Effective for ServicesRendered on or After 12/01/83.)</ITAG>Transplant surgeons have established a definite correlation in both cadaverand living-related kidney transplantation between pretransplant transfusionsof blood into the recipient and the success of graft retention.

A devicethat generates an electrical current with controlled frequency, intensity,wave form and type (galvanic of faradic) is used in combination with apad electrode and a hand applicator electrode to provide electrical stimulation.<ITAG tagnum="81">35-73 INJECTION SCLEROTHERAPY FOR ESOPHAGEAL VARICEAL BLEEDING. (Effectivefor Services Performed on or After 10/29/84.)</ITAG>Injection sclerotherapy is a technique involving insertion of a flexiblefiberoptic endoscope into the esophagus, and the injection of a sclerosingagent or solution into the varicosities to control bleeding. This procedureis covered under Medicare. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-74 EXTERNAL COUNTERPULSATION (ECP)._NOT COVERED. </ITAG>External counterpulsation, a noninvasive means of producing the hemodynamiceffects of intravascular counterpulsation, is a way of supporting a failingcirculatory system due to myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock byhelping the heart pump more blood with less effort. The device uses thepatient's legs as a pumbing chamber by enclosing the leg in rigid cylinderswith a water-filled bag situated between the patient's legs and the cylinders,and changing the vascular pressure by alternate infusion and removal ofwater from the bag. An electrocardiogram with delay and duration circuitscontrols phasing of the pump with cardiac action. Although the external counterpulsation device appears to be safe, publishedclinical evidence and the option of the medical community do not supportthe clinical utility of the device as a means of treating heart failure.While external counterpulsation appears to yield some benefits, there isless evidence that it reduces systolic pressure and, thus, the workloadof the heart. External counterpulsation is therefore, not covered underMedicare. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-75 INTRAOPERATIVE VENTRICULAR MAPPING_(Effective for services renderedon or after 10/29/84.)</ITAG>Intraoperative ventricular mapping is the technique of recording cardiacelectrical activity directly from the heart. The recording sites are usuallyidentified from an anatomical grid and may consist of epicardial, intramural,and endocardial sites. A probe with electrodes is used to explore thesesurfaces and generate a map that displays the sequence of electrical activation.This information is used by the surgeon to locate precisely the site ofan operative intervention. The introperative ventricular mapping procedure is covered under Medicareonly for the uses and medical conditions described below: andbullet; localize accessory pathways associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White(WPW) and other preexcitation syndromes; andbullet; map the sequence of atrial and ventricular activation for drug-resistantsupraventricular tachycardias; andbullet; delineate the anatomical course of His bundle and/or bundle branchesduring corrective cardiac surgery for congenital heart diseases; and andbullet; direct the surgical treatment of patients with refractory ventriculartachyarrhythmias. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-77 NEUROMUSCULAR ELECTRICAL STIMULATION (NMES) IN THE TREATMENTOF DISUSE ATROPHY (Effective for services performed on and after 11-5-84.)</ITAG>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) involves the use of a devicewhich transmits an electrical impulse to the skin over selected musclegroups by way of electrodes. Coverage of NMES is limited to the treatmentof disuse atrophy where nerve supply to the muscle is intact, includingbrain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves, and other non-neurological reasonsfor disuse are causing atrophy. Some examples would be casting or splintingof a limb, contracture due to scarring of soft tissue as in burn lesions,and hip replacement surgery (until orthotic training begins). (See andSection;45-25 for an explanation of coverage of medically necessary supplies forthe effective use of NMES.) <ITAG tagnum="81">35-78 DIAGNOSTIC ENDOCARDIAL ELECTRICAL STIMULATION (PACING)_Effectivefor services performed on or after 12-03-84.) </ITAG>Diagnostic endocardial electrical stimulation (EES), also called programmedelectrical stimulation of the heart, is covered under Medicare when usedfor patients with severe cardiac arrhythmias. Diagnostic endocardial electrical stimulation involves the detection andstimulation of cardiac electrical activity for the purpose of studyingarrhythmias and abnormalities of the heart's conduction system. Intracardiacelectrode catheters, intracardiac and extracardiac recordings and a stimulatordevice are required. From two to six multipolar electrode catheters areinserted percutaneously, usually through the femoral veins, and advancedto the heart under fluoroscopic control. Other venous are arterial routesmay be employed as well. An intracardiac His bundle cardiogram is usuallyobtained during EES as are conventional electrocardiograms. No separatecharge will be recognized for the His Bundle cardiogram. (See andSection;50-3.) EES is used to investigate the mechanisms, site of origin and pathwaysof cardiac arrhythmias as well as to select therapeutic approaches fortheir resolution. EES is also employed to identify patients at risk ofsudden arrhythmic death. The principal use for EES is in the diagnosisand treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia. However, it has alsoproven to be of value in the diagnosis and management of other complexarrhythmias, conduction defects, and after cardiac arrest. <ITAG tagnum="81">35-79 ANESTHESIA IN CARDIAC PACEMAKER SURGERY (Effective for servicesperformed on or after </ITAG><T3>July 27, 1988</T3>.The use of general or monitored anesthesia during <T3>transvenous </T3>cardiac pacemaker surgery may be reasonable and necessaryand therefore covered under Medicare <T3>only</T3> if adequate documentation of medical necessity is providedon a case-by-case basis.

In the last few years several new approaches in the surgical managementof upper urinary tract kidney stones have been developed, among them invasiveand non-invasive lithotripsy techniques. In addition to the traditional surgical/endoscopic techniques for the treatmentof kidney stones the following lithotripsy techniques are also coveredfor services rendered on or after March 15, 1985. A. <T3>Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy.</T3>_Extracorporeal Shock WaveLithotripsy (ESWL) is a non-invasive method of treating kidney stones usinga device called a lithotriptor. The lithotriptor uses shock waves generatedoutside of the body to break up upper urinary tract stones; it focusesthe shock waves specifically on stones under X-ray visualization, pulverizingthem by repeated shocks. ESWL is covered under Medicare for use in thetreatment of upper urinary tract kidney stones. B. <T3>Percutaneous Lithotripsy.</T3>_Percutaneous lithotripsy (or nephrolithotomy)is an invasive method of treating kidney stones by using ultrasound, electrohydraulicor mechanical lithotripsy. A probe is inserted through an incision in theskin directly over the kidney and applied to the stone. A form of lithotripsyis then used to fragment the stone. Mechanical or electrohydraulic lithotripsymay be used as an alternative or adjunct to ultrasonic lithotripsy. Percutaneouslithotripsy of kidney stones by ultrasound or by the related techniquesof electrohydraulic or mechanical lithotripsy is covered under Medicare.The following is covered for services rendered on or after <T3>JANUARY 16, 1988. </T3>C. <T3>Transurethral Ureteroscopic Lithotripsy._</T3>Transurethral ureteroscopiclithotripsy is a method of fragmenting and removing ureteral and renalstones through a cystoscope. The cystoscope is inserted through the urethrainto the bladder. Catheters are passed through the scope into the openingwhere the ureters enter the bladder. Instruments passed through this openinginto the ureters are used to manipulate and ultimately disintegrate stones,using either mechanical crushing, transcystroscopic electrohydraulic shockwaves, ultrasound or laser. Transurethral ureteroscopic lithotripsy forthe treatment of urinary tract stones of the kidney or ureter is coveredunder Medicare.<ITAG tagnum="81">35-82 PANCREAS TRANSPLANTS_Not Covered. </ITAG>Pancreas transplants of any type are considered investigational and are,therefore, not covered under Medicare.<ITAG tagnum="81">35-83 24-HOUR AMBULATORY ESOPHAGEAL pH MONITORING_(Effective for servicesperformed on or after 6-11-85). </ITAG>Twenty-four hour ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring is a diagnostic procedureinvolving the placement of an indwelling electrode into the lower esophagusof a patient for the purpose of determining the presence of gastric refluxand measuring abnormal esophageal acid exposure.Twenty-four hour ambulatory pH monitoring is covered by Medicare for patientswho are suspected of having gastric reflux, but only if the patient presentsdiagnostic problems associated with atypical symptoms or the patient'ssymptoms are suggestive of reflux, but conventional tests have not confirmedthe presence of reflux.<ITAG tagnum="81">35-84 STEREOTACTIC CINGULOTOMY AS A MEANS OF PSYCHOSURGERY_NOT COVERED.</ITAG>Cingulotomy is a psychosurgial procedure designed to interrupt the interconnectingneuronal pathways of the brain involved in the regulation of the emotionsand certain autonomic functions. The intent of psychosurgery is to modifyor alter disturbances of behavior, thought content, or mood that are notresponsive to other conventional modes of therapy, or for which no organicpathological cause can be demonstrated by established methods. The operation usually involves bilateral lesions that are placed in theanterior cingulum of the brain. Electrocautery probes are stereotacticallyinserted through lateral burr holes in the skull. A radiofrequency pulsatingcurrent is used to ablate the tissue that connects the limbic system tothe frontal lobe. Two or three repeat procedures may be performed in thesame patient when a satisfactory result has not been achieved with thefirst cingulotomy. Stereotactic cingulotomy is not covered under Medicare because the procedureis considered to be investigational.<ITAG tagnum="81">35-85 IMPLANTATION OF AUTOMATIC DEFIBRILLATORS  (Effective for servicesperformed on and after 1-24-86). </ITAG>The implantable automatic defibrillator is an electronic device designedto detect and treat life-threatening tachyarrhythmias.

Whether a drugrepresents an allowable inpatient hospital cost during such stay dependson whether it meets the definition of a drug in section 1861(t) of thelaw; i.e., on its inclusion in the compendia named in the law or approvalby the hospital's pharmacy and drug therapeutics (Pandamp;DT) or equivalentcommittee. (Levodopa (L-Dopa) has been favorably evaluated for the treatmentof Parkisonism by A.M.A. Drug Evaluations, First Edition 1971, the replacementcompendia for ``New Drugs.''Inpatient hospital services are frequently <T3>not </T3>required in many cases when L-Dopa therapy is initiated. Therefore,the medical need for inpatient hospital services must be determined onthe basis of medical facts in the individual case. It is not necessaryto hospitalize the typical, well-functioning, ambulatory Parkinsonian patientwho has no concurrent disease at the start of L-Dopa treatment. It <T3>is </T3>reasonable to provide inpatient hospital services for Parkinsonianpatients with concurrent diseases, particularly of the cardiovascular,gastrointestinal, and neuropsychiatric systems.

In such situations the roleof the therapist is to evaluate the patient's needs in consultation withhis physician, design a program of exercise appropriate to the capacityand tolerance of the patient and treatment objectives of the physician,leaving to others the actual carrying out of the program. While the evaluativeservices rendered by a qualified physical therapist are reimburseable asphysical therapy, services furnished by others in connection with the carryingout of the maintenance program established by the therapist are not.Cross refer: Intermediary Manual, andSection; 3101.3; Carriers Manual, andSection;2050.5.B. <T3>Part A Reimbursement for L-Dopa Therapy in SNFs._</T3>Initiation ofL-Dopa therapy can be appropriately carried out in the SNF setting, applyingthe same guidelines used for initiation of L-Dopa therapy in the hospital,including the types of patients who should be covered by inpatient services,the role of physical therapy, and the use of laboratory tests. (See subsectionA.)Where inpatient care is required and L-Dopa therapy is initiated in theSNF, limit the stay to a maximum of 4 weeks; but in many cases the needmaybe no longer than 1 or 2 weeks, depending upon the patient's condition.However, where L-Dopa therapy is begun in the hospital and the patientis transferred to an SNF for continuation of the therapy, a combined lengthof stay in hospital and SNF of no longer than 4 weeks is reasonable (i.e.,1 week hospital stay followed by 3 weeks SNF stay; or 2 weeks hospitalstay followed by 2 weeks SNF stay; etc.). Medical need must be demonstratedin cases where the combined length of stay in hospital and SNF is longerthan 4 weeks. The choice of hospital or SNF, and the decision regardingthe relative length of time spent in each, should be left to the medicaljudgment of the treating physician.Cross refer: Intermediary Manual, andSection; 3133.5.C. <T3>L-Dopa Coverage Under Part B._</T3>Part B reimbursement may not bemade for the drug L-Dopa since it is a self-administrable drug.

They are covered when used for that purpose.<ITAG tagnum="81">45-15 PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE WITHIN AN INSTITUTION_COVERAGE OF SERVICESAND SUPPLIES INCIDENT TO A PHYSICIAN'S SERVICES</ITAG>Where a physician establishes an office within a nursing home or otherinstitution, coverage of services and supplies furnished in the officemust be determined in accordance with the ``incident to a physician's professionalservice'' provision (see Intermediary Manual, andSection; 3112.4A or CarriersManual, andSection; 2050.1), as in any physician's office. A physician'soffice within an institution must be confined to a separately identifiedpart of the facility which is used solely as the physician's office andcannot be construed to extend throughout the entire institution. Thus,services performed outside the ``office'' area would be subject to thecoverage rules applicable to services furnished outside the office setting.In order to accurately apply the criteria in andSection; 3112.4 or andSection;2050.1, give consideration to the physical proximity of the institutionand physician's office. When his office is located within a facility, aphysician may not be reimbursed for services, supplies, and use of equipmentwhich fall outside the scope of services ``commonly furnished'' in physician'soffices generally, even though such services may be furnished in his institutionaloffice. Additionally, make a distinction between the physician's officepractice and the institution, especially when the physician is administratoror owner of the facility. Thus, for their services to be covered underthe criteria in andSection; 3112.4A or andSection; 2050.1, the auxiliary medicalpersonnel must be members of the office staff rather than of the institution'sstaff, and the cost of supplies must represent an expense to the physician'soffice practice. Finally, services performed by the employees of the physicianoutside the ``office'' area must be <T3>directly </T3>supervised by the physician; his presence in the facilityas a whole would not suffice to meet this requirement. (In <T3>any </T3>setting, of course, supervision of auxiliary personnel inand of itself is not considered a ``physician's professional service''to which the services of the auxiliary personnel could be an incidentalpart, i.e., in addition to supervision, the physician must perform or haveperformed a personal professional service to the patient to which the servicesof the auxiliary personnel could be considered an incidental part). Denialsfor failure to meet any of these requirements would be based on andSection;1861(s)(2)(A) of the Act.Establishment of an office within an institution would not modify rulesotherwise applicable for determining coverage of the physician's personalprofessional services within the institution. However, in view of the opportunityafforded to a physician who maintains such an office for rendering servicesto a sizable number of patients in a short period of time or for performingfrequent services for the same patient, claims for physicians' servicesrendered under such circumstances would require careful evaluation by thecarrier to assure that payment is made only for services that are reasonableand necessary.Cross-refer: Intermediary Manual, andSection; 3112.4A; Carriers Manual, andSection;2050.1.<ITAG tagnum="81">45-16 CERTAIN DRUGS DISTRIBUTED BY THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (Effectivefor services furnished on or after October 1, 1980.)</ITAG>Under its Cancer Therapy Evaluation, the Division of Cancer Treatment ofthe National Cancer Institute (NCI), in cooperation with the Food and DrugAdministration, approves and distributes certain drugs for use in treatingterminally ill cancer patients. One group of these drugs, designated asGroup C drugs, unlike other drugs distributed by the NCI, are not limitedto use in clinical trials for the purpose of testing their efficacy. Drugsare classified as Group C drugs only if there is sufficient evidence demonstratingtheir efficacy within a tumor type and that they can be safely administered.A physician is eligible to receive Group C drugs from the Division of CancerTreatment only if the following requirements are met:A. A physician must be registered with the NCI as an investigator by havingcompleted an FD-Form 1573.B.

The following guidelines aredesigned to assist contractors in identifying and processing claims forsuch services.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>These new guidelines are limited to lithium battery-poweredpacemakers, because mercury-zinc battery-powered pacemakers are no longerbeing manufactured and virtually all have been replaced by lithium units.Contractors still receiving claims for monitoring such units should continueto apply the guidelines published in 1980 to those units until they arereplaced.</ITAG>There are two general types of pacemakers in current use_single-chamberpacemakers, which sense and pace the ventricles of the heart, and dual-chamberpacemakers which sense and pace both the atria and the ventricles. Thesedifferences require different monitoring patterns over the expected lifeof the units involved. One fact of which contractors should be aware isthat many dual-chamber units may be programmed to pace only the ventricles;this may be done either at the time the pacemaker is implanted or at sometime afterward. In such cases, a dual-chamber unit, when programmed orreprogrammed for ventricular pacing, should be treated as a single-chamberpacemaker in applying screening guidelines. The decision as to how often any patient's pacemaker should be monitoredis the responsibility of the patient's physician who is best able to takeinto account the condition and circumstances of the individual patient.These may vary over time, requiring modifications of the frequency withwhich the patient should be monitored. In cases where monitoring is doneby some entity other than the patient's physician, such as a commercialmonitoring service or hospital outpatient department, the physician's prescriptionfor monitoring is required and should be periodically renewed (at leastannually) to assure that the frequency of monitoring is proper for thepatient. <T3>Where a patient is monitored both during clinic visits and transtelephonically,the contractor should be sure to include fequency data on both types ofmonitoring in evaluating the reasonableness of the frequency of monitoringservices received by the patient</T3>. Since there are over 200 pacemaker models in service at any given point,and a variety of patient conditions that give rise to the need for pacemakers,the question of the appropriate frequency of monitorings is a complex one.Nevertheless, it is possible to develop guidelines within which the vastmajority of pacemaker monitorings will fall and contractors should do this,using their own data and experience, as well as the frequency guidelineswhich follow, in order to limit extensive claims development to those casesrequiring special attention. Guidelines for Transtelephonic Monitoring of Cardiac PacemakersA. <T3>General.</T3>_Transtelephonic monitoring of pacemakers is coming intoincreasingly widespread use, with the services being furnished by commercialsuppliers, hospital outpatient departments and physicians' offices.Telephone monitoring of cardiac pacemakers as described below is medicallyefficacious in identifying early signs of possible pacemaker failure, thusreducing the number of sudden pacemaker failures requiring emergency replacement.All systems which monitor the pacemaker rate (bpm) in both the free-runningand/or magnetic mode are effective in detecting subclinical pacemaker failuredue to battery depletion. More sophisticated systems are also capable ofdetecting internal electronic problems within the pulse generator itselfand other potential problems. In the case of dual chamber pacemakers inparticular, such monitoring may detect failure of synchronization of theatria and ventricles, and the need for adjustment and reprogramming ofthe device.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>The transmitting device furnished to the patient is simplyone component of the diagnostic system, and is not covered as durable medicalequipment. Those engaged in transtelephonic pacemaker monitoring shouldreflect the costs of the transmitters in setting their charges for monitoring.</ITAG>B. <T3>Definition of Transtelephonic Monitoring.</T3>_In order for transtelephonicmonitoring services to be covered, the services must consist of the followingelements:1. A minimum 30-second readable strip of the pacemaker in the free-runningmode;2. Unless contraindicated, a minimum 30-second readable strip of the pacemakerin the magnetic mode; and3. A minimum 30 seconds of readable ECG strip.C. <T3>Frequency Guidelines for Transtelephonic Monitoring.</T3>_The guidelinesbelow constitute a system which contractors should use, in conjunctionwith their knowledge of local medical practices, to screen claims for transtelephonicmonitoring prior to payment. It is important to note that they are notrecommendations with respect to a <T3>minimum</T3> frequency for such monitorings, but rather a <T3>maximum</T3> frequency (within which payment may be made without furtherclaims development). As with previous guidelines, more frequent monitoringsmay be covered in cases where contractors are satisfied that such monitoringsare medically necessary; e.g., based on the condition of the patient, orwith respect to pacemakers exhibiting unexpected defects or premature failure.Contractors should seek written justification for more frequent monitoringsfrom the patient's physician and/or any monitoring service involved.These guidelines are divided into two broad categories_Guideline I, whichwill apply to the majority of pacemakers now in use, and Guideline II,which will apply to pacemaker systems (pacemaker and leads) for which sufficientlong-term clinical information exists to assure that they meet the standardsof the Inter-Society Commission for Heart Disease Resources (ICHD) forlongevity and end-of-life decay. (The ICHD standards are: (1) 90 percentcumulative survival at 5 years following implant; and (2) an end-of-lifedecay of less than a 50 percent drop of output voltage and less than 20percent deviation of magnet rate, or a drop of 5 beats per minute or less,over a period of 3 months or more.) Contractors should consult with theirmedical advisers and other appropriate individuals and organizations (suchas the Northern American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology, whichpublishes product reliability information) should questions arise overwhether a pacemaker system meets the ICHD standards.The two groups of guidelines are then further broken down into two generalcategories_single chamber and dual-chamber pacemakers. Contractors shouldbe aware that the frequency with which a patient is monitored may be changedfrom time to time for a number of reasons, such as a change in the patient'soverall condition, a reprogramming of the patient's pacemaker, the developmentof better information on the pacemaker's longevity or failure mode, etc.Consequently, changes in the proper set of guidelines may be required.Contractors should inform physicians and monitoring services to alert contractorsto any changes in the patient's monitoring prescription that might necessitatechanges in the screening guidelines applied to that patient. (Of particularimportance is the reprogramming of a dual-chamber pacemaker to a single-chambermode of operation. Such reprogramming would shift the patient from theappropriate dual-chamber guideline to the appropriate single-chamber guideline.)Guideline I<ITAG tagnum="16">1.

Clinic visits may be done in conjunction with transtelephonicmonitoring or as a separate service; however, the services rendered bya pacemaker clinic are more extensive than those currently possible bytelephone. They include, for example, physical examination of patientsand reprogramming of pacemakers. Thus, the use of one of these types ofmonitoring does not preclude concurrent use of the other.2. <T3>Frequency Guidelines_</T3>As with transtelephonic pacemaker monitoring,the frequency of clinic visits is the decision of the patient's physician,taking into account, among other things, the medical condition of the patient.However, contractors can develop monitoring guidelines that will proveuseful in screening claims. The following are recommendations for monitoringguidelines on lithium-battery pacemakers:a. For single-chamber pacemakers_twice in the first 6 months followingimplant, then once every 12 months.b.

Plethysmography is of value as a noninvasive techniquefor diagnostic, preoperative and postoperative evaluation of peripheralartery disease in the internal medicine or vascular surgery practice. Itis also a useful tool for the preoperative podiatric evaluation of thediabetic patient or one who has intermittent claudication or other signsor symptoms indicative of peripheral vascular disease which would havea bearing on the patient's candidacy for foot surgery.The oldest form of plethysmography is the venous occlusive pneumoplethysmography.This method is cumbersome, time consuming, and requires considerable trainingto give useful, reproducible results. Nonetheless, in the setting of thehospital vascular laboratory, this technique should be considered a reasonableand necessary procedure for the diagnostic evaluation of suspected peripheralarterial disease. It is unsuitable for routine use in the physician's office.Recently, however, a number of other plethysmographic methods have beendeveloped which make use of phenomena such as changes in electric impedanceor changes in segmental blood pressure at constant volume to assess regionalperfusion. Several of these methods have reached a level of developmentwhich makes them clinically valuable.Medicare coverage is extended to those procedures listed in Category Ibelow when used for the accepted medical indications mentioned above. Theprocedures in Category II are still considered experimental and are notcovered at this time. Denial of claims because a noncovered procedure wasused or because there was no medical indication for plethysmographic evaluationof any type should be based on andSection; 1862(a)(1) of the law.CATEGORY I<T3>Segmental Plethysmography_</T3>Included under this procedure are servicesperformed with a regional plethysmograph, differential plethysmograph,recording oscillometer, and a pulse volume recorder.Electrical Impedance Plethysmography<T3>Ultrasonic Measurement of Blood Flow (Doppler)_</T3>While not strictlya plethysmographic method this is also a useful tool in the evaluationof suspected peripheral vascular disease or preoperative screening of podiatricpatients with suspected peripheral vascular compromise. (See andSection;50-7 for the applicable coverage policy on this procedure).<T3>Oculoplethysmography_</T3>See andSection; 50-37, Noninvasive Tests ofCarotid Function.<T3>Strain Gauge Plethysmography_</T3>This test is based on recording thenon-pulsatile aspects of inflowing blood at various points on an extremityby a mercury-in-silastic strain gauge sensor. The instrument consists ofa chart recorder, an automatic cuff inflation and deflation system, anda recording manometer.CATEGORY IIThe following methods have not yet reached a level of development suchas to allow their routine use in the evaluation of suspected peripheralvascular disease.<T3>Inductance Plethysmography_</T3>This method is considered experimentaland does not provide reproducible results.<T3>Capacitance Plethysmography_</T3>This method is considered experimentaland does not provide reproducible results.<T3>Mechanical Oscillometry_</T3>This is a non-standardized method whichoffers poor sensitivity and is not considered superior to the simple measurementof peripheral blood pressure.<T3>Strain Gauge Plethysmography_</T3>This method is still considered experimental,does not provide consistent results, and is therefore not suitable forroutine office use.<T3>Photoelectric Plethysmography_</T3>This method is considered usefulonly in determining whether or not a pulse is present and does not providereproducible measurements of blood flow.Differential plethysmography, on the other hand, is a system which usesan impedance technique to compare pulse pressures at various points alonga limb, with a reference pressure at the mid-brachial or wrist level. Itis not clear whether this technique, as usually performed in the physician'soffice, meets the definition of plethysmography because quantitative measurementsof blood flow are usually not made. It has been concluded, in any event,that the differential plethysmography system is a blood pulse recorderof undetermined value, which has the potential for significant overutilization.Therefore, reimbursement for studies done by techniques other than venousocclusive pneumoplethysmography should be denied, at least until additionaldata on these devices, including controlled clinical studies, become available.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-7 ULTRASOUND DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES</ITAG><T3>Coverage._</T3>Ultrasound diagnostic procedures utilizing low energysound waves are being widely employed to determine the composition andcontours of nearly all body tissues except bone and air-filled spaces.This technique permits noninvasive visualization of even the deepest structuresin the body.

However, in an individual case the contractor'smedical staff may determine that use of a CT scan as the initial diagnostictest was not reasonable and necessary because it was not supported by thepatient's symptoms or complaints stated on the claim form; e.g., ``periodicheadaches.''Continue to review claims for CT scans for evidence of abuse which mightinclude the absence of reasonable indications for the scans, an excessivenumber of scans or unnecessarily expensive types of scans considering thefacts in the particular cases.C. <T3>Approved Models of CT Equipment.</T3>_1. <T3>Criteria for Approval.</T3>_In the absence of evidence to the contrary,you may assume that a CT scan for which payment is requested has been performedon equipment that meets the following criteria:andbullet; The model must be known to the Food and Drug Administration, andandbullet; Must be in the full market release phase of development.Should it be necessary to confirm that those criteria are met, ask themanufacturer to submit the information in subsection C.2. If manufacturersinquire about obtaining Medicare approval for their equipment, inform themof the foregoing criteria.2. <T3>Evidence of Approval:</T3>a. The letter sent by the Bureau of Radiological Health, Food and DrugAdministration (FDA), to the manufacturer acknowledging the FDA's receiptof information on the specific CT scanner system model submitted as requiredunder Public Law 90-602, ``The Radiation Control for Health and SafetyAct of 1986.''b. A letter signed by the chief executive officer or other officer actingin a similar capactity for the manufacturer which:(1) Furnishes the CT scanner system model number, all names that hospitalsand physicians' offices may use to refer to the CT scanner system on claims,and the accession number assigned by FDA to the specific model;(2) Specifies whether the scanner performs head scans only, body scansonly (i.e., scans of parts of the body other than the head), or head andbody scans;(3) States that the company or corporation is satisfied with the resultsof the developmental stages that preceded the full market release phaseof the equipment, that the equipment is in the full market release phase,and the date on which it was decided to put the product into the full marketrelease phase.D. <T3>Mobile CT Equipment.</T3>_CT scans performed on mobile units are subjectto the same Medicare coverage requirements applicable to scans performedon stationary units, as well as certain health and safety requirementsrecommended by PHS. As with scans performed on stationary units, the scansmust be determined medically necessary for the individual patient. Thescans must be performed on types of CT scanning equipment that have beenapproved for use as stationary units (see C above), and must be in compliancewith applicable State laws and regulations for control or radiation.1. <T3>Hospital Setting.</T3>_The hospital must assume responsibility forthe quality of the scan furnished to inpatients and outpatients and mustassure that a radiologist or other qualified physician is in charge ofthe procedure. The radiologist or other physician (i.e., one who is withthe mobile unit) who is responsible for the procedure must be approvedby the hospital for similar privileges.2. <T3>Ambulatory Setting.</T3>_If mobile CT scan services are furnished atan ambulatory health care facility other than a hospital-based facility,e.g., a freestanding physician-directed clinic, the diagnostic proceduremust be performed by or under the direct personal supervision of a radiologistor other qualified physician. In addition, the facility must maintain arecord of the attending physician's order for a scan performed on a mobileunit.3. <T3>Billing for Mobile CT Scans.</T3>_Hospitals, hospital-associated radiologists,ambulatory health care facilities, and physician owner/operators of mobileunits may bill for mobile scans as they would for scans performed on stationaryequipment.4. <T3>Claims Review.</T3>_Evidence of compliance with applicable State lawsand regulations for control of radiation should be requested from ownersof mobile CT scan units upon receipt of the first claims. All mobile scanclaims should be reviewed very carefully in accordance with instructionsapplicable to scans performed on fixed units, with particular emphasison the medical necessity for scans performed in an ambulatory setting.E. <T3>Multiplanar Diagnostic Imaging (MIPDI).</T3>_(Effective for servicesperformed on or after 6-11-85.)In usual computerized tomography (CT) scanning procedures, a series oftransverse or axial images are reproduced. These transverse images areroutinely translated into coronal and/or sagittal views. Multiplanar diagnosticimaging (MPDI) is a process which further translates the data producedby CT scanning by providing reconstructed oblique images which can contributeto diagnostic information. MPDI, also known as planar image reconstructionor reformatted imaging, is covered under Medicare when provided as a serviceto an entity performing a covered CT scan.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-13 MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (Effective for services performedon or after 11-22-85.)</ITAG>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), formerly called nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR), is covered under Medicare when furnished as described below forthe types of covered conditions described in this instruction.A. <T3>General.</T3>1. <T3>Method of Operation.</T3>_Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasivemethod of graphically representing the distribution of water and otherhydrogen-rich molecules in the human body. In contrast to conventionalradiographs or CT scans, in which the image is produced by X-ray beam attenuationby an object, MRI is capable of producing images by several techniques.In fact, various combinations of MR image production methods may be employedto emphasize particular characteristics of the tissue or body part beingexamined. The basic elements by which MRI produces an image are the densityof hydrogen muclei in the object being examined, their motion, and therelaxation times, the period of time required for the nuclei to returnto their original states in the main, static magnetic field after beingsubjected to a brief additional magnetic field. These relaxation timesreflect the physical-chemical properties of tissue and the molecular environmentof its hydrogen nuclei. Only hydrogen atoms are present in human tissuesin sufficient concentration for current use in clinical MRI.2. <T3>General Clinical Utility.</T3>_Overall, MRI is a useful diagnosticimaging modality that is capable for demonstrating a wide variety of soft-tissuelesions with contrast resolution equal or superior to CT scanning in variousparts of the body.Among the advantages of MRI are the absence of ionizing radiation and theability to achieve high levels of tissue contract resolution without injectedinodiated contrast agents. Recent advances in technology have resultedin development of new paramagnetic contrast agents for MRI which alloweven better visualization in some instances. Multislice imaging and theability to image in multiple planes, especially sagittal and coronal, haveprovided a flexibility not easily available with other modalities. Becausecortical bone and metallic prostheses do not cause distortion of MR images,it has been possible to visualize certain lesions and body regions withgreater certainty than has been possible with CT. The use of MRI on certainsoft tissue structures for the purpose of detecting disruptive, neoplastic,degenerative or inflammatory lesions has now become established in medicalpractice.B. <T3>Covered Clinical Applications.</T3>_Although several uses of MRI arestill considered investigational, and some uses are clearly contraindicated(see C. below), MRI is considered medically efficacious for a number ofuses. Contractors should use the following descriptions as general guidelinesor examples of what may be considered covered, rather than as a restrictivelist of specific coverages. Coverage is limited to MRI units which havereceived premarket approval by the Food and Drug Administration; and suchunits must be operated within the parameters specified by the approval.As with all items and services, the services must be reasonable and necessaryfor the diagnosis or treatment of the specific patient involved.MRI is useful in examining the head, central nervous system, and spine.Multiple sclerosis can be diagnosed with MRI and the contents of the posteriorfossa are visible. The inherent tissue contrast-resolution of MRI makesit an appropriate standard diagnostic modality for general neuroradiology.Although MRI can be used to detect degeneration of intervertebral discs,radiological imaging is the preferred modality for diagnosing disc herniationor prolapse. However, in some cases, especially when sensitivity to radiologicalcontrast agents exists and their use is contraindicated, MRI may be covered.MRI can assist in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal and retroperitonealmasses including abnormalities of the large vessels such as aneurysms anddissection. When a clinical need exists to visualize the parenchyma ofsolid organs to detect anatomic disruption or neoplasia, this can be accomplishedin the liver, urogenital system, adrenals, and pelvic organs without theuse of radiological contrast materials. MRI may also be used to detectand stage pelvic and retroperitoneal neoplasms, and to evaluate disordersof cancellous bone and soft tissues. It may also be used in the detectionof pericardial thickening.Primary and secondary bone neoplasms and aseptic necrosis can be detectedat an early stage and monitored with MRI. Patients with metallic prostheses,especially of the hip, can be imaged in order to detect the early stagesof infection of the bone to which the prothesis is attached.C. <T3>Contraindications and investigational uses.</T3>1. <T3>Contraindications.</T3>_MRI is not covered when the following patient-specificcontraindications are present. It is not covered for patients with cardiacpacemakers or with metallic clips on vascular aneurysms. MRI during a viablepregnancy is also contraindicated at this time. The danger inherent inbringing ferromagnetic materials within range of MRI units generally constrainsthe use of MRI on acutely ill patients requiring life support systems andmonitoring devices which employ ferromagnetic materials. In addition, thelong imaging time and the enclosed position of the patient may result inclaustrophobia, making patients who have a history of claustrophobia unsuitablecandidates for MRI procedures.2. <T3>Investigational uses.</T3>_Several uses of MRI have been identifiedas investigational and are not covered. These include procedures involvinggating devices, which are generally used on organs which are in motion,such as the heart or lungs, the measurement of blood flow and spectroscopy.In addition, MRI is not suitable for the imaging of cortical bone and calcifications,or for procedures involving spatial resolution of bone or calcifications.The use of surface RF coils, whether for sending or receiving RF signals,in conjunction with MRI procedures, is also considered investigational.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-15 ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC SERVICES</ITAG>Reimbursement may be made under Part B for electrocardiographic servicesrendered by a physician or incident to his services or by an approved laboratoryor an approved supplier of portable X-ray services. Since there is no coveragefor EKG services of any type rendered on a screening basis or as part ofa routine examination, the claim must indicate the signs and symptoms orother clinical reason necessitating the services.A separate charge by an attending or consulting physician for EKG interpretationshould be allowed only where it is the normal practice to make such chargein addition to the regular office visit charge. No payment should be madefor EKG interpretations by individuals other than physicians.A claim involving EKG services furnished by a <T3>laboratory </T3>or a <T3>portable X-ray supplier </T3>should identify the physician orderingthe service and, where the charge includes both the taking of the tracingand its interpretation, the identity of the physician making the interpretation.No separate bill for the services of a physician should be paid unlessit is clear that he was the patient's attending physician or was actingas a consulting physician. The taking of an EKG in an emergency, i.e.,where the patient is or may be experiencing what is commonly referred toas a ``heart atack,'' would be covered as a laboratory service or a diagnosticservice by a portable X-ray supplier only where the evidence shows thata physician was in attendance at the time the service was performed orimmediately thereafter.Where EKG services are rendered in the patient's home and the laboratory'sor portable X-ray supplier's charge is higher than that imposed for thesame service when performed in the laboratory or portable X-ray supplier'soffice, the medical need for home service should be documented. In theabsence of such justification, reimbursement for the service if otherwisemedically necessary should be based on the reasonable charge applicablewhen performed in the laboratory or X-ray supplier's office.The documentation required in the various situations mentioned above mustbe furnished not only when the laboratory or portable X-ray supplier billsthe patient or carrier for its service, but also when such a facility billsthe attending physician who, in turn, bills the patient or carrier forthe EKG services. (In addition to the evidence required to document theclaim, the laboratory or portable X-ray supplier must maintain in its recordsthe referring physician's written order and the identity of the employeetaking the tracing.)<T3>Long Term EKG Monitoring, </T3>also referred to as long-term EKG recording,Holter recording, or dynamic electrocardiography, is a diagnostic procedurewhich provides a continuous record of the electrocardiographic activityof a patient's heart while he is engaged in his daily activities.The basic components of the long-term EKG monitoring systems are a sensingelement, the design of which may provide either for the recording of electrocardiographicinformation on magnetic tape or for detecting significant variations inrate or rhythm as they occur, and a component for either graphically recordingthe electrocardiographic data or for visual or computer assisted analysisof the information recorded on magnetic tape. The long-term EKG permitsthe examination in the ambulant or potentially ambulant patient of as manyas 70,000 heartbeats in a 12-hour recording while the standard EKG whichis obtained in the recumbent position, yields information on only 50 to60 cardiac cycles and provides only a limited data base on which diagnosticjudgments may be made.Many patients with cardiac arrhythmias are unaware of the presence of anirregularity in heart rhythm. Due to the transient nature of many arrhythmiasand the short intervals in which the rhythm of the heart is observed byconventional standard EKG techniques, the offending arrhythmias can goundetected. With the extended examination provided by the long-term EKG,the physician is able not only to detect but also to classify various typesof rhythm disturbances and waveform abnormalities and note the frequencyof their occurrence. The knowledge of the reaction of the heart to dailyactivities with respect to rhythm, rate, conduction disturbances, and ischemicchanges are of great assistance in directing proper therapy and rehabilitation.This modality is valuable in both inpatient and outpatient diagnosis andtherapy. Long-term monitoring of ambulant or potentially ambulant inpatientsprovides significant potential for reducing the length of stay for post-coronaryinfarct patients in the intensive care setting and may result in earlierdischarge from the hospital with greater assurance of safety to the patients.The indications for the use of this technique, noted below, are similarfor both inpatients and outpatients.The long-term EKG has proven effective in detecting transient episodesof cardiac dysrhythmia and in permitting the correlation of these episodeswith cardiovascular symptomatology. It is also useful for patients whohave symptoms of obscure etiology suggestive of cardiac arrhythmia. Examplesof such symptoms include palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, light-headedness,near syncope, syncope, transient ischemic episodes, dyspnea, and shortnessof breath.This technique would also be appropriate at the time of institution ofany arrhythmic drug therapy and may be performed during the course of therapyto evaluate response. It is also appropriate for evaluating a change ofdosage and may be indicated shortly before and after the discontinuationof anti-arrhythemic medication. The therapeutic response to a drug whoseduration of action and peak of effectiveness is defined in hours cannotbe properly assessed by examining 30-40 cycles on a standard EKG rhythmstrip. The knowledge that all patients placed on anti-arrhythmic medicationdo not respond to therapy and the known toxicity of anti-arrhythmic agentsclearly indicate that proper assessment should be made on an individualbasis to determine whether medication should be continued and at what dosagelevel.The long-term EKG is also valuable in the assessment of patients with coronaryartery disease. It enable the documentation of etiology of such symptomsas chest pain and shortness of breath. Since the standard EKG is oftennormal during the intervals between the episodes of precordial pain, itis essential to obtain EKG information while the symptoms are occurring.The long-term EKG has enabled the correlation of chest symptoms with theobjective evidence of ST-segment abnormalities. It is appropriate for patientswho are recovering from an acute mycardial infarction or coronary insufficiencybefore and after discharge from the hospital, since it is impossible topredict which of these patients is subject to ventricular arrhythmias onthe basis of the presence or absence of rhythm disturbances during theperiod of initial coronary care. The long-term EKG enables the physicianto identify patients who are at a higher risk of dying suddenly in theperiod following an acute myocardial infarction. It may also be reasonableand necessary where the high-risk patient with known cardiovascular diseaseadvances to a substantially higher level of activity which might triggerincreased or new types of arrhythmias necessitating treatment. Such a high-riskcase would be one in which there is documentation that acute phase arrhythmiashave not totally disappeared during the period of convalescence.In view of recent developments in cardiac pacemaker monitoring techniques(see CIA 50-1), the use of the long-term EKG for routine assessment ofpacemaker function can no longer be justified. Its use for the patientwith an internal pacemaker would be covered only when he has symptoms suggestiveof arrhythmia not revealed by the standard EKG or rhythm strip.These guidelines are intended as a general outline of the circumstancesunder which the use of this diagnostic procedure would be warranted. Eachpatient receiving a long-term EKG should be evaluated completely, priorto performance of this diagnostic study. A complete history and physicalexamination should be obtained and the indications for use of the long-termEKG should be reviewed by the referring physician.The performance of a long-term EKG does not necessarily require the priorperformance of a standard EKG. Nor does the demonstration of a normal standardEKG preclude the need for a long-time EKG. Finally, the demonstration ofan abnormal standard EKG does not obviate the need for a long-term EKGif there is suspicion that the dysrhythmia is transient in nature.A period of recording of up to 24 hours would normally be adequate to detectmost transient arrhythmias and provide essential diagnostic information.The medical necessity for longer periods of monitoring must be documented.Medical documentation for adjudicating claims for the use of the long-termEKG should be similar to other EKG services, X-ray services, and laboratoryprocedures. Generally, a statement of the diagnostic impression of thereferring physician with an indication of the patient's relevant signsand symptons should be sufficient for purposes of making a determinationregarding the reasonableness and medical necessity for the use of thisprocedure. However, the intermediaries or carriers should require whateveradditional documentation their medical consultants deem necessary to properlyadjudicate the individual claim where the information submitted is notadequate.It should be noted that the recording device furnished to the patient issimply one component of the diagnostic system and a separate charge forit will not be recognized under the durable medical equipment benefit.<T3>Patient-Activated EKG Recorders, </T3>distributed under a variety ofbrand names, permit the patient to record an EKG upon manifestation ofsymptoms, or in response to a physician's order (e.g., immediately followingstrong exertion). Most such devices also permit the patient to simultaneouslyvoice-record in order to describe symptoms and/or activty. In addition,some of these devices permit transtelephonic transmission of the recordingto a physician's office, clinic, hospital, etc., having a decoder/recorderfor review and analysis, thus eliminating the need to physicially transportthe tape. Some of thes devices also permit a ``time sampling'' mode ofoperation. However, the ``time sampling'' mode is not covered_only thepatient-activated mode of operation, when used for the indications describedbelow, is covered at this time.Services in connection with patient-activated EKG recorders are coveredwhen used as an alternative to the long-term EKG monitoring (describedabove) for similar indications_detecting and characterizing symptomaticarrhythmias, regulation of anti-arrhythmic drug therapy, etc. Like long-termEKG monitoring, use of these devices is covered for evaluating patientswith symptoms of obscure etiology suggestive of cardiac arrhythmia suchas palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, lightheadedness, near syncope,syncope, transient ischemic episodes, dyspnea and shortness of breath.As with long-term EKG monitors, patient-activated EKG recorders may beuseful for both inpatient and outpatient diagnosis and therapy. While usefulfor assessing some post-coronary infarct patients in the hospital setting,these devices should not, however, be covered for outpatient monitoringof recently discharged post-infarct patients.<T3>Computer Analyzed Electrocardiograms._</T3>Computer interpretationof EKG's is recognized as a valid and effective technique which will improvethe quality and availability of cardiology services. Reimbursement maybe made for such computer service when furnished in the setting and underthe circumstances required for coverage of other electrocardigraphic services.Where either a laboratory's or a portable x-ray supplier's charge for EKGservices includes the physician review and certification of the printoutas well as the computer interpretation, the certifying physician must beidentified on the HCFA-1490 before the entire charge can be considereda reimbursable charge. Where the laboratory's (or portable x-ray supplier's)reviewing physician is not identified, the carrier should conclude thatno professional component is involved and make its charge determinationaccordingly. If the supplying laboratory (or portable x-ray supplier whensupplied by such a facility) does not include professional review and certificationof the hard copy, a charge of the patient's physician may be recognizedfor the service. In any case the charge for the physician component shouldbe substantially less than that for physician interpretation of the conventionalEKG tracing in view of markedly reduced demand on the physician's timewhere computer interpretation is involved. Considering the unit cost reductionexpected of this innovation, the total charge for the complete EKG service(taking of tracing and interpretation) when computer interpretation isemployed should never exceed that considered reasonable for the servicewhen physician interpretation is involved.<T3>Transtelephonic Electrocardiographic Transmissions (Formerly Referredto as EKG Telephone Reporter Systems).</T3>_Effective for services furnishedon and after March 1, 1980, coverage is extended to include the use oftranstelephonic electrocardiographic (EKG) transmissions as a diagnosticservice for the indications described below, when performed with equipmentmeeting the standards described below, subject to the limitations and conditionsspecified below. Coverage is further limited to the amounts payable withrespect to the physician's service in interpreting the results of suchtransmissions, including charges for rental of the equipment. The deviceused by the beneficiary is part of a total diagnostic system and is notconsidered durable medical equipment.1. <T3>Covered Uses.</T3>_The use of transtelephonic EKGs is covered for thefollowing uses:a. to detect, characterize, and document <T3>symptomatic </T3>transient arrhythmias;b. To overcome problems in regulating antiarrhythmic drug dosage;c. To carry out early posthospital monitoring of patients discharged aftermyocardial infarction; (only if 24-hour coverage is provided, see 4. below).Since cardiology is a rapidly changing field, some uses other than thosespecified above may be covered if, in the judgment of the contractor'smedical consultants, such a use was justifiable in the particular case.The enumerated uses above represent uses for which a firm coverage determinationhas been made, and for which contractors may make payment without extensiveclaims development or review. 2. <T3>Specifications for Devices.</T3>_The devices used by the patient arehighly portable (usually pocket-sized) and detect and convert the normalEKG signal so that it can be transmitted via ordinary telephone apparatusto a receiving station. At the receiving end, the signal is decoded andtranscribed into a conventional EKG. There are numerous devices availablewhich transmit EKG readings in this fashion. For purposes of Medicare coverage,however, the transmitting devices must meet at least the following criteria:a. They must be capable of transmitting EKG Leads, I, II, or III;b. These lead transmissions must be sufficiently comparable to readingsobtained by a conventional EKG to permit proper interpretation of abnormalcardiac rhythms.3. <T3>Potential for Abuse_Need for Screening Guidelines.</T3>_While the useof these devices may often compare favorably with more costly alternatives,this is the case only where the information they contribute is activelyutilized by a knowledgeable practitioner as part of overall medical managementof the patient. Consequently, it is vital that contractors be aware ofthe potential for abuse of these devices, and adopt necessary screeningand physician education policies to detect and halt potentially abusivesituations. For example, use of these devices to diagnose and treat suspectedarrhythmias as a routine substitute for more conventional methods of diagnosis,such as a careful history, physical examination, and standard EKG and rhythmstrip would not be appropriate. Moreover, contractors should require writtenjustification for use of such devices in excess of 30 consecutive daysin cases involving detection of transient arrhythmias.Contractors may find it useful to review claims for these devices witha view toward detecting patterns of practice which may be useful in developingschedules which may be adopted for screening such claims in the future.4. <T3>Twenty-four Hour Coverage.</T3>_No payment may be made for the useof these devices to carry out early posthospital monitoring of patientsdischarged after myocardial infarction unless provision is made for 24hour coverage in the manner described below.Twenty-four hour coverage means that there must be, at the monitoring site(or sites) an experienced EKG technician receiving calls; tape recordingdevices do not meet this requirement. Further, such technicians shouldhave immediate access to a physician, and have been instructed in whenand how to contact available facilities to assist the patient in case ofemergencies.Cross-refer: HCFA-Pub. 13-3, andSection;andSection; 3101.5, 3110, 3112.3, HCFA-Pub.14-3, andSection;andSection; 2070, 2255, 2050.1.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-16 HEMORHEOGRAPH</ITAG>The hemorheograph is a diagnostic instrument which is safe and effectivefor determining the adequacy of skin perfusion prior to the performanceof minor surgical procedures on the extremities, including minor podiatricprocedures, and as an adjunct to the evaluation of patients suspected ofhaving peripheral vascular disease.Program reimbursement may be made only for those services employing thehemorheograph which are performed for preoperative and postoperative diagnosticevaluation of suspected peripheral artery disease.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_This instrument is not a plethysmograph and should not beconsidered as such.

Laboratory tests are essential to monitor the progess of CRD patients.The following list and frequencies of tests constitutes the level and typesof routine laboratory tests that are covered. Bills for other types oftests are considered nonroutine. Routine tests at greater frequencies mustinclude medical justification. Nonroutine tests generally are justifiedby the diagnosis. The routinely covered regimen includes the followingtests:Per Dialysis<ITAG tagnum="15">Hematocrit</ITAG>Per Week<ITAG tagnum="15">Prothrombin time for patients on anti-coagulant therapy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Serum Creatinine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">BUN</ITAG>Monthly<ITAG tagnum="15">Serum Calcium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Serum Potassium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Serum Chloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Serum Bicarbonate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Serum Phosphorous</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Total Protein</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Serum Albumin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Alkaline Phospatase</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">SGOT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">LDH</ITAG>Guidelines for tests other than those routinely performed include:Bone survey, either the roentgenographic method or the photon absorptiometricprocedure for bone mineral analysis-annually.The frequency of the need to perform ``bone surveys'' varies with manyfactors, some of which are the age of the patient (e.g., children and theelderly), clinical symptoms (e.g., bone pain, evidence of metastatic calcification),abnormal laboratory tests) e.g., changes in alkaline phosphatase, calcium,phosphorus), and because of therapeutic intervention directed at forestallingor improving pre-exisitng or potential bone disease (e.g., vitamin D, calciumsupplments, parathyroidectomy). Where any of these factors apply to thebeneficiary, claims for ``bone surveys'' performed on a frequency moreoften than annually need only have minimal documentation of medical need.Nerve conductor velocity test (peritoneal NCV)_once every 3 months.EKG_once very 3 months.Chest X-ray_once every 6 months (effective for services rendered on orafter December 1, 1978).Hepatitis associated antigen tests_once a month. (These tests previouslywere subject to a guideline limit of once a quarter. While their categoryhas been changed so that they now can be provided once a month withoutadditional documentation, they should be billed for separately becausethe reimbursement screens for maintenance dialysis treatments did not takethem into account).B. Laboratory tests are subject to the normal coverage requirements. Ifthe laboratory services are performed by a free-standing facility, it mustmeet the conditions of coverage for independent laboratories.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-18 ELECTRON MICROSCOPE</ITAG>The electron microscope has been used in the examination of biopsies foryears and its efficacy, and therefore its Medicare coverage, is not beingquestioned. However, there also are other less expensive methods for examiningbiopsies which are normally adequate. The additional expense for the electronmicroscope is normally warranted only when distinguishing different typesof nephritis from renal needle biopsies or when there is an uncertain diagnosisfrom the pathologist. When an uncertain diagnosis from the pathologistsresults from a less expensive method of examination, and an electron microscopeexamination is therefore necessary, both biopsy examinations are covered.Where the additional expense for an electron microscope examination isnot warranted, program payment will be based upon the less costly methodsof examining biopsies.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-19 PRONOUNCEMENT OF DEATH</ITAG>According to estabished legal principles, an individual is not considereddeceased until there has been official pronouncement of death. An individualis therefore considered to have expired as of the time he is pronounceddead by a person who is legally authorized to make such a pronouncement,usually a physician. Reasonable and necessary medical services renderedup to and including pronouncement of death by a physician are covered diagnosticor therapeutic services.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-20 PAP SMEARS (Effective for pap smears performed on or after May15, 1978.)</ITAG>The pap smear is a diagnostic test which can show the absence or presenceof one or more of the following conditions: trauma, infection, carcinogens,and viruses. The test is also frequently part of a routine physical examination;as such, it is not a covered Medicare service. A pap smear may be coveredunder the following conditions: (1) Previous cancer of the cervix, uterus,or vagina which has been or is presently being treated, (2) Previous abnormalpap smear, (3) Any abnormal findings of the vagina, cervix, uterus, ovaries,or adnexa, (4) Any significant complaint by the patient referrable to thefemale reproductive system, or (5) any signs or symptoms which might inthe physician's judgment reasonably be related to gynecologic disorder.In respect to number five (5) above, the intermediary's medical staff shoulddetermine whether in a particular case a previous malignancy at anothersite is a diagnostic indication for a pap smear so that the test wouldnot be considered part of a routine screening.Cross-refer: HCFA 13-3, andSection;andSection; 3101.5; HCFA 14-3, andSection;2070.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-21 MAMMOGRAMS</ITAG>(Effective for mammograms performed on or after May 15, 1978).A radiological mammogram is a covered diagnostic test under the followingconditions: (1) A patient has distinct signs and symptoms for which a mammogramis indicated, (2) A patient has a history of breast cancer, or (3) A patientis asymptomatic but, on the basis of the patient's history and other factorsthe physician considers significant, the physician's judgment is that amammogram is appropriate.Use of mammograms in routine screening of (1) asymptomatic women aged 50and over, and (2) asymptomatic women aged 40 or over whose mothers or sistershave had the disease, is considered medically appropriate, but would notbe covered for Medicare purposes.Cross-refer: HCFA 13-3, andSection;andSection; 3101.5; HCFA 14-3, andSection;2070.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-22 CHALLENGE INGESTION FOOD TESTING</ITAG>(Effective for services performed on and after August 1, 1978).Challenge ingestion food testing is a safe and effective technique in thediagnosis of food allergies. This procedure may be covered when it is usedon an outpatient basis if it is reasonable and necessary for the individualpatient.Challenge ingestion food testing has not been proven to be effective inthe diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, depression, or respiratory disorders.Accordingly, its use in the diagnosis of these conditions is not reasonableand necessary within the meaning of section 1862(a)(1) of the Medicarelaw, and no program payment may be made for this procedure when it is soused.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-23 HISTOCOMPATIBILITY TESTING</ITAG>(Effective for services performed on and after August 1, 1978).Histocompatibility testing involves the matching or typing of the humanleucocyte antigen (HLA). This testing is safe and effective when it isperformed on patients:A. In preparation for a kidney transplant;B. In preparation for bone marrow transplant;C. In preparation for blood platelet transfusions (particularly where multipleinfusions are involved); orD. Who are suspected of having ankylosing spondylitis.This testing is covered under Medicare when used for any of the indicationslisted in A, B, and C and if it is reasonable and necessary for the patient.It is covered for ankylosing spondylitis in cases where other methods ofdiagnosis would not be appropriate or have yielded inconclusive results.Request documentation supporting the medical necessity of the test fromthe physician in all cases where ankylosing spondylitis is indicated asthe reason for the test.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-24 HAIR ANALYSIS_NOT COVERED</ITAG>Hair analysis to detect mineral traces as an aid in diagnosing human diseaseis not a covered service under Medicare.The correlation of hair analysis to the chemical state of the whole bodyis not possible at this time, and therefore this diagnostic procedure cannotbe considered to be reasonable and necessary under andSection; 1862(a)(1)of the law.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-25 ESOPHAGEAL MANOMETRY</ITAG>(Effective for services performed on and after October 2, 1978).Esophageal manometry is covered under Medicare where it is determined tobe reasonable and necessary for the individual patient. The major use ofesophageal manometry is to measure pressure within the esophagus to assistin the diagnosis of esophageal pathology including aperistalsis, spasm,achalasia, esophagitis, esophageal ulcer, esophageal congenital webs, diverticuli,scleroderma, hiatus hernia, congenital cysts, benign and malignant tumors,hypermobility, hypomobility, and extrinsic lesions. Esophageal manometryis mostly used in difficult diagnostic cases and as an adjunct to X-raysand direct visualization of the esophagus (endoscopy) through the fiberscope.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-26 DENTAL EXAMINATION PRIOR TO KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION</ITAG>Despite the ``dental services exclusion'' in andSection; 1862(a)(12) of theAct (see Intermediary Manual, andSection; 3162; Carriers Manual, andSection;2336), an oral or dental examination performed on an inpatient basis aspart of a comprehensive workup prior to renal transplant surgery is a coveredservice. This is because the purpose of the examination is not for thecare of the teeth or structures directly supporting the teeth. Rather,the examination is for the identification, prior to a complex surgicalprocedure, of existing medical problems where the increased possibilityof infection would not only reduce the chances for successful surgery butwould also expose the patient to additional risks in undergoing such surgery.Such a dental or oral examination would be covered under Part A of theprogram if performed by a dentist on the hospital's staff, or under PartB if performed by a physician. (When performing a dental or oral examination,a dentist is not recognized as a physician under andSection; 1861(r) of thelaw.)

The major factors which support a determination that a diagnostic procedureperformed as part of the admitting procedure to a hospital or skilled nursingfacility is reasonable and necessary are: A. The test is specifically ordered by the admitting physician (or a hospitalor skilled nursing facility staff physician having responsibility for thepatient where there is no admitting physician): i.e., it is not furnishedunder the standing orders of a physician for his patients; B. The test is medically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of theindividual patient's condition; and C. The test does not unnecessarily duplicate the same test performed onan outpatient basis prior to admission or performed in connection witha recent hospital or skilled nursing facility admission. Where you have not already done so, consult with PROs to obtain informationgathered by the PROs on a sample basis as to whether X-rays and diagnostictests are being specifically ordered as described under subsection (A).<ITAG tagnum="81">50-29 CYTOGENETIC STUDIES</ITAG>(Effective for services performed on and after October 1, 1979). The term cytogenetic studies is used to describe the microscopic examinationof the physical appearance of human chromosomes.

There are a variety of these tests which measure variousanatomical and physiological aspects of carotid function, including pressure(systolic, diastolic, and pulse), flow, collateral circulation, and turbulence. For operational purposes it is useful to classify noninvasive tests ofcarotid function into direct and indirect tests; the direct tests examinethe anatomy and physiology of the carotid artery, while the indirect testsexamine hemodynamic changes in the disal beds of the carotid artery (theorbital and cerebral circulations).  It is important to note that the names of these tests are not standardized.Following are some of the acceptable tests, recognizing that this listis not inclusive and that determinations should be made by local medicalconsultants:  <ITAG tagnum="81">DIRECT TESTS  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Carotid Phonoangiography  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Direct Bruit Analysis  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Spectral Bruit Analysis  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Doppler Flow Velocity  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ultrasound Imaging including Real Time  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">B-Scan and Doppler Devices  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">INDIRECT TESTS  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Periorbital Directional Doppler Ultrasonography  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Oculoplethysmography  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Ophthalmodynamometry  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">50-38 ENDOTHELIAL CELL PHOTOGRAPH  </ITAG>(Effective for services rendered on and after August 19, 1983)  Endothelial cell photography involves the use of a specular microscopeto determine the endothelial cell count. It is used by ophthalmologistsas a predictor of success of ocular surgery or certain other ocular procedures.Endothelial cell photography is a covered procedure under Medicare whenreasonable and necessary for patients who meet one or more of the followingcriteria:  1.

Are about to be fitted with extended wear contact lenses after intraocularsurgery.  <ITAG tagnum="81">50-39 TELEPHONE TRANSMISSION OF ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAMS  </ITAG>Telephone transmission of electroencephalograms (EEGs) is covered as aphysician's service or as incident to a physician's service when reasonableand necessary for the individual patient, under appropriate circumstances.The service is safe, and may save time and cost in sending EEGs from remoteareas without special competence in neurology, neurosurgery, and electroencephalography,by avoiding the need to transport patients to large medical centers forstandard EEG testing.  Telephone transmission of EEGs has been most helpful in the following clinicalsituations:  A. Altered consciousness, such as stuporous, semicomatose, or comatosestates;  B. Atypical seizure variants in patients experiencing bizarre, distressingsymptoms as seen with ``spike and wave stupor'' or other forms of seizuredisorders;  C. Diagnosis of a suspected intracranial tumor;  D. Head injury, where a subdural hematoma may be identified;  E. Headaches during the acute phase where, for instance, in migraine syndrome,abnormal responses may be seen.  Telephonically transmitted EEGs should <T3>not </T3>be used for determining electrical inactivity (i.e., braindeath), because of unavoidable signal interference.  <ITAG tagnum="81">50-39.1 AMBULATORY ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC (EEG) MONITORING  </ITAG>(Effective for services performed on or after June 12, 1984)  Ambulatory or 24-hour electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring is accomplishedby a cassette recorder that continuously records brain wave patterns during24 hours of a patient's routine daily activities and sleep. The monitoringequipment consists of an electrode set, preamplifiers, and a cassette recorder.The electrodes attach to the scalp, and their leads are connected to arecorder, usually worn on a belt.  Ambulatory EEG monitoring is a diagnostic procedure for patients in whoma seizure diathesis is suspected but not defined by history, physical orresting EEG. Ambulatory EEG can be utilized in the differential diagnosisof syncope and transient ischemic attacks if not elucidated by conventionalstudies. Ambulatory EEG should always be preceded by a resting EEG.     Ambulatory EEG monitoring is considered an established technique and coveredunder Medicare for the above purposes.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-40 STEREOTAXIC DEPTH ELECTRODE IMPLANTATION</ITAG>Stereotaxic depth electrode implantation prior to surgical treatment offocal epilepsy for patients who are unresponsive to anticonvulsant medicationshas been found both safe and effective for diagnosing resectable seizurefoci that may go undetected by conventional scalp electroencephalographs(EEGs).The procedure employs thin wire electrodes which are implanted in the brainof the focal epileptic patient for EEG monitoring. By taking several readingsduring seizure activity, the location of the epileptic focus may be found,so that better informed decisions can be made regarding the surgical treatmentof persons with intractable seizures.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-41 HUMAN TUMOR STEM CELL DRUG SENSITIVITY ASSAYS</ITAG>Human tumor stem cell drug sensitivity assays involve exposure of humantumor stem cell colonies grown in tissue culture to anticancer drugs andobserving for cytotoxic effects. Their purpose is to screen potential anticancerdrugs and predict the effects of these drugs on tumors of individual patients,to allow the selection of the most effective drug or drugs for that patient.Human tumor drug sensitivity assays are considered experimental, and therefore,not covered under Medicare at this time.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-42 AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING WITH FULLY AND SEMI-AUTOMATIC(PATIENT-ACTIVATED) PORTABLE MONITORS_NOT COVERED</ITAG>While ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in hypertensive patients usingfully and semi-automatic (patient-activated) portable monitors is a safeand accurate means of measuring blood pressure, the clinical usefulnessof the data obtained from such devices is not clearly established. Researchersand clinicians cite the need for standardization of instrumentation andfurther study of this technology to better ascertain its role in hypertensivetherapy. Accordingly, program payment may not be made for the use of suchdevices at this time.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-43 DIGITAL SUBTRACTION ANGIOGRAPHY</ITAG>Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is a diagnostic imaging techniquethat applies computer technology to fluoroscopy for the purpose of visualizingthe same vascular structures observable with conventional angiography.Since the radiographic contrast material can be injected into a vein ratherthan an artery, the procedure reduces the risk to patients, and can bedone on an outpatient basis. Contractors should be alert to possible increasesin utilization of DSA over conventional angiographic procedures, as wellas to the fact that ordinarily patients should not require inpatient hospitalizationsolely to perform the procedure.Reimbursement for DSA should not exceed, and may be less than, that beingpaid for conventional angiographic techniques.

The studies assess bone massor density associated with such diseases as osteoporosis, osteomalacia,and renal osteodystrophy. Various single or combined methods of measurementmay be required to: (a) diagnose bone disease; (b) monitor the course ofbone changes with disease progression; or (c) monitor the course of bonechanges with therapy. Bone density is usually studied by using photodensitometry,single or dual photon absorptiometry, or bone biopsy.The following bone (mineral) density studies are covered under Medicare:A. <T3>Single Photon Absorptiometry._</T3>A non-invasive radiological techniquethat measures absorption of a monochromatic photon beam by bone material.The device is placed directly on the patient, uses a low dose of radionuclide,and measures the mass absorption efficiency of the energy used. It providesa quantitative measurement of the bone mineral of cortical and trabecularbone, and is used in assessing an individual's treatment response at appropriateintervals.Single photon absorptiometry is covered under Medicare when used in assessingchanges in bone density of patients with osteodystrophy or osteoporosiswhen performed on the same individual at intervals of 6 to 12 months.B. <T3>Bone Biopsy._</T3>A physiologic test which is a surgical, invasiveprocedure. A small sample of bone (usually from the ilium) is removed,generally by a biopsy needle. The biopsy sample is then examined histologically,and provides a qualitative measurement of the bone mineral of trabecularbone. This procedure is used in ascertaining a differential diagnosis ofbone disorders and is used primarily to differentiate osteomalacia fromosteoporosis.Bone biopsy is covered under Medicare when used for the qualitative evaluationof bone no more than four times per patient, unless there is special specialjustification given. When used more than four times on a patient, bonebiopsy leaves a defect in the pelvis and may produce some patient discomfort.C. <T3>Photodensitometry._</T3>(radiographic absorptiometry)._A noninvasiveradiological procedure that attempts to assess bone mass by measuring theoptical density of extremity radiographs with a photodensitometer, usuallywith a reference to a standard density wedge placed on the film at thetime of exposure. This procedure provides a quantitative measurement ofthe bone mineral of cortical bone, and is used for monitoring gross bonechange.The following bone (mineral) density study is not covered under Medicare:<T3>Dual Photon Absorptiometry._</T3>A noninvasive radiological techniquethat measures absorption of a dichromatic beam by bone material. This procedureis not covered under Medicare because it is still considered to be in theinvestigational stage.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-45 LYMPHOCYTE MITOGEN RESPONSE ASSAYS</ITAG>For services performed on or after May 16, 1983.The lymphocyte mitogen response assay measures the immune response of patientperipheral blood lymphocytes. It is a covered test under Medicare whenit is medically necessary to assess lymphocytic function in diagnosed immunodeficiencydiseases and to monitor immunotherapy.It is <T3>not covered</T3> when it is used to monitor the treatment of cancer,because its use for that purpose is experimental.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-46 TRANSILLUMINATION LIGHT SCANNING, OR DIAPHANOGRAPHY_NOT COVERED</ITAG>While transillumination light scanning, or diaphanography, for use in detectionof cancer and other diseases of the breast, appears safe, the usefulnessof this instrumentation, when compared to existing modes of cancer andother breast disease detection, has not clearly been established. Furtherstudy of this technology is needed to determine its role in breast cancerdiagnosis. Program payment may not be made for this procedure at this time.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-47 CARDIOINTEGRAM (CIG) AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO STRESS TEST OR THALLIUMSTRESS TEST_NOT COVERED</ITAG>A cardiointegram device consists of a microcomputer which receives outputfrom a standard electrocardiogram (EKG) and transforms it to produce agraphic representation of heart electrophysiologic signals. This procedureis used primarily as a substitute for Exercise Tolerance Testing with ThalliumImaging in patients for whom a resting EKG may be inadequate to identifychanges compatible with coronary artery disease. Because this device isstill considered investigational pending additional data on its clinicalefficacy/sensitivity and value as a diagnostic tool, program payment maynot be made for its use at this time.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-48 PORTABLE HAND-HELD X-RAY INSTRUMENT</ITAG>(Effective for services performed on or after November 6, 1986.)This low intensity X-ray imaging device is a light weight portable hand-heldinstrument using a low level isotope as its penetrating energy source.It can picture any part of the human anatomy which can be inserted in thespace between the energy source and the viewing mechanism. The device canbe useful in making an immediate diagnosis in the following settings: isolatedareas, accident scenes, sports events and emergency rooms. It is also usefulin the following instances where fluoroscopy would ordinarily be used:localization of foreign bodies, selected surgical procedures and the evaluationof premature or low birth weight infants. The use of the portable hand-heldX-ray instrument as an imaging device is covered under Medicare. It shouldbe reimbursed as part of the physician's professional service, and no additionalcharge should be allowed.<ITAG tagnum="81">50-49 COMPUTER ENHANCED PERIMETRY</ITAG>(Effective for services rendered on or after February 15, 1984).Computer enhanced perimetry involves the use of a micro-computer to measurevisual sensitivity at preselected locations in the visual field.

Serologic testing is employed to detect antibodies to the AIDS virus, whichis currently identified by the term ``human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).''The virus originally was named ``human T-cell lymphotropic virus, typeIII (HTLV-III), a term that remains in common usage. Antibodies may be detected by a variety of immunoassay techniques, themost common being an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). When anassay is reactive on initial testing, it should be repeated on the samespecimen. A more specific test, (Western blot, immunofluorescent assay)is usually performed following repeatedly reactive ELISA results. These tests may be covered when performed to help determine a diagnosisfor symptomatic patients. They are not covered when furnished as part ofa screening program for asymptomatic persons. NOTE: Two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests that were conductedon the same specimen must both be positive before Medicare will cover theWestern blot test. <ITAG tagnum="81">50-53 FOOD ALLERGY TESTING AND TREATMENT_NOT COVERED </ITAG>(Effective for services furnished on or after October 31, 1988.) Effective October 31, 1988, sublingual intracutaneous and subcutaneousprovocative and neutralization testing and neutralization therapy for foodallergies are excluded from Medicare coverage because available evidencedoes not show that these tests and therapies are effective. This exclusionwas published as a Final Notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 29, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="81">55 DIALYSIS EQUIPMENT </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">55-1 WATER PURIFICATION AND SOFTENING SYSTEMS USED IN CONJUNCTIONWITH HOME DIALYSIS </ITAG>A. <T3>Water Purification Systems.</T3>_Water used for home dialysis shouldbe chemically free of heavy trace metals and/or organic contaminants whichcould be hazardous to the patient. It should also be as free of bacteriaas possible but need not be biologically sterile. Since the characteristicsof natural water supplies in most areas of the country are such that sometype of water purification system is needed, such a system used in conjunctionwith a home dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis) unit is coveredunder Medicare. There are two types of water purification systems which will satisfy theserequirements: <T3>Deionization.</T3>_The removal of organic substances, mineral saltsor magnesium and calcium (causing hardness), compounds of fluoride andchloride from tap water using the process of filtration and ion exchange;or <T3>Reverse Osmosis.</T3>_The process used to remove impurities from tapwater utilizing pressure to force water through a porous membrane. Use of both a deionization unit and reverse osmosis unit in series, theoreticallyto provide the advantages of both systems, has been determined medicallyunnecessary since either system can provide water which is both chemicallyand bacteriologically pure enough for acceptable use in home dialysis.In addition, spare deionization tanks are not covered since they are essentiallya precautionary supply rather than a current requirement for treatmentof the patient. Activated carbon filters used as a component of water purification systemsto remove unsafe concentrations of chlorine and chloramines are coveredwhen prescribed by a physician. B. <T3>Water Softening System._</T3>Except as indicated below, a water softeningsystem used in conjunction with home dialysis is excluded from coverageunder Medicare as not being reasonable and necessary within the meaningof andSection; 1862(a)(1) of the law. Such a system, in conjunction witha home dialysis unit, does not adequately remove the hazardous heavy metalcontaminants (such as arsenic) which may be present in trace amounts. A water softening system may be covered when used to pretreat water tobe purified by a reverse osmosis (RO) unit for home dialysis where: andbullet; The manufacturer of the RO unit has set standards for the qualityof water entering the RO (e.g., the water to be purified by the RO mustbe of a certain quality if the unit is to perform as intended); andbullet; The patient's water is demonstrated to be of a lesser qualitythan required; andandbullet; The softener is used only to soften water entering the RO unit,and thus, used only for dialysis. (The softener need not actually be builtinto the RO unit, but must be an integral part of the dialysis <T3>system</T3>.)C. <T3>Developing Need When a Water Softening System is Replaced with a WaterPurification Unit in an Existing Home Dialysis System._</T3>The medicalnecessity of water purification units must be carefully developed whenthey replace water softening systems in existing home dialysis systems.A purification system may be ordered under these circumstances for a numberof reasons. For example, changes in the medical community's opinions regardingthe quality of water necessary for safe dialysis may lead the physicianto decide the quality of water previously used should be improved, or thewater quality itself may have deteriorated. Patients may have dialyzedusing only an existing water softener previous to Medicare ESRD coveragebecause of inability to pay for a purification system. On the other hand,in some cases, the installation of a purification system is not medicallynecessary. Thus, when such a case comes to your attention, ask the physicianto furnish the reason for the changes. Supporting documentation, such asthe supplier's recommendations or water analysis, may be required.

This section also includes special coverage criteria for portableoxygen systems in subsection E. Special requirements for patients alreadycovered under a program of home oxygen therapy as of September 30, 1985,are described in subsection F. Finally, a statement on the absence of coverageof the professional services of a respiratory therapist under the DME benefitis included in subsection G.B. <T3>Medical Documentation.</T3>_<T3>Initial</T3> claims for oxygen services <T3>must</T3> include a short written statement from the attending physicianindicating that other forms of treatment (e.g., medical and physical therapydirected at secretions, bronchospasm and infection) have been tried, havenot been sufficiently successful, and oxygen therapy is still required.While there is no substitute for oxygen therapy, it is appropriate thateach patient should receive optimum therapy before long-term home oxygentherapy is ordered.<T3>Initial </T3>claims for oxygen services <T3>must </T3>also be supported by medical documentation (separate documentationwhere electronic billing is used), such as a prescription, written by thepatient's attending physician who has recently examined the patient (normallywithin a month of the start of therapy) that specifies:andbullet; A diagnosis of the disease requiring home use of oxygen;andbullet; The oxygen flow rate; andNOTE: All claims with flow rates of more than 2 liters per minute <T3>must </T3>be reviewed by a carrier's medical staff before payment canbe made.andbullet; An estimate of the frequency, duration of use (e.g., 2 litersper minute, 10 minuts per hour, 12-hours a day) and duration of need (e.g.,6 months or lifetime).NOTE: A prescription for ``Oxygen PRN'' or ``Oxygen as needed'' does notmeet this last requirement. Neither provides any basis for determiningif the amount of oxygen is reasonable and necessary for the patient.The attending physician may also specify the type of oxygen delivery systemto be used (i.e., gas, liquid, or concentrator). If the type of systemis specified, then the medical reasons for selecting that system over thealternative systems must also be specified.New medical documentation written by the patient's attending physicianmust be submitted to the carrier in support of revised oxygen requirementswhen there has been a change in the patient's condition and need for oxygentherapy.Carriers are required to conduct periodic, continuing medical necessityreview on patients whose conditions warrant these reviews and on patientswith indefinite or extended periods of necessity as described in CarriersManual, Part 3, andSection; 4105.2B. Where indicated, carriers may also requestdocumentation of the results of a repeat arterial blood gas or oximetrystudy. (See subsection C.)C. <T3>Laboratory Evidence.</T3>_<T3>Initial</T3> claims for oxygen therapy <T3>must</T3> also include the results of a blood gas study that has beenordered and evaluated by the attenting physician. This will <T3>usually</T3> be in the form of a measurement of the partial pressureof oxygen (PO2) in arterial blood. (See Carriers Manual, Part 3, andSection;2070.1 for instructions on clinical laboratory tests.) A measurement ofarterial oxygen saturation obtained by ear or pulse oximetry, however,will also be acceptable when ordered and evaluated by the attending physician<T3>and </T3>performed under his or her supervision or when performed bya qualified provider or supplier of laboratory services. A DME supplierwill not be considered a qualified provider or supplier of laboratory servicesfor purposes of these guidelines. The conditions under which the laboratorytests are performed must be specified in writing and submitted with the<T3>initial </T3>claim, i.e., at rest, while sleeping, while exercising,on room air, or if while on oxygen, the amount, body position during testing,and similar information necessary for interpreting the evidence as specifiedby the carrier.The preferred sources of laboratory evidence are existing physician and/orhospital records that reflect the patient's medical condition. Since itis expected that virtually all patients who qualify for home oxygen coveragefor the first time under these guidelines would have recently been dischargedfrom a hospital where they submitted to arterial blood gas tests, the carriershould request that such test results be submitted in support of theirinitial claims for home oxygen. If more than one arterial blood gas testis performed during the patient's hospital stay, the test result obtainedclosest to the hospital discharge date would be the best evidence of theneed for home oxygen therapy. Carriers may accept an attending physician'sstatement of recent hospital test results for a particular patient, whereappropriate, in lieu of copies of actual hospital records. Subsequent bloodgas tests that appear to duplicate the hospital test (e.g., where thereis no reason to believe the patient's condition may have changed) shouldbe denied as not medically reasonable and necessary.A repeat arterial blood gas or oximetry study will normally be necessaryonly where evidence indicates that an oxygen recipient has undergone a<T3>major </T3>change relevant to home use of oxygen. For example, if thecarrier has reason to believe that there has been a major change in thepatient's physical condition (e.g., where there has been a significantincrease in the amount of oxygen billed on a monthly basis) it may askfor documentation of the results of another blood gas or oximetry study. D. <T3>Health Conditions.</T3>_Coverage is available for patients with significanthypoxemia in the chronic stable state if: (1) the attending physician hasdetermined that the patient has a health condition outlined in subsectionD.1, (2) the patient meets the blood gas evidence requirements specifiedin subsection D.3, and (3) the patient has appropriately tried other alternativetreatment measures without complete success. (See subsection B1.)  1. <T3>Conditions for Which Oxygen Therapy May Be Covered.</T3>_  andbullet; A severe lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,diffuse interstitial lung disease, whether of known or unknown etiology;cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis; widespread pulmonary neoplasm; or  andbullet; Hypoxia-related symptoms or findings that might be expected toimprove with oxygen therapy. Examples of these symptoms and findings arepulmonary hypertension, recurring congestive heart failure due to chroniccor pulmonale, erythrocytosis, impairment of the cognitive process, nocturnalrestlessness, and morning headache.  2. <T3>Conditions for Which Oxygen Therapy Is Not Covered.</T3>_  andbullet; Angina pectoris in the absence of hypoxemia. This condition isgenerally not the result of a low oxygen level in the blood and there areother preferred treatments.  andbullet; Breathlessness without cor pulmonale or evidence of hypoxemia.Although intermittent oxygen use is sometimes prescribed to relieve thiscondition, it is potentially harmful and psychologically addicting.  andbullet; Severe peripheral vascular disease resulting in clinically evidentdesaturation in one or more extremities. There is no evidence that increasedPO<T2>2</T2> will improve the oxygenation of tissues with impaired circulation. andbullet; Terminal illnesses that do not affect the lungs.  3. <T3>Covered Blood Gas Values.</T3>_If the patient has a condition specifiedin subsection D.1., the carrier must review the medical documentation andlaboratory evidence that has been submitted for a particular patient (seesubsections B and C) and determine if coverage is available under one ofthe three group categories outlined below:  a. <T3>Group I.</T3>_Except as modified in subsection d, coverage is providedfor patients with significant hypoxemia evidenced by <T3>any </T3>of the following:  (1) An arterial PO<T2>2</T2> at or below 55 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen saturation at orbelow 88 percent, <T3>taken at rest, </T3>breathing room air.  (2) An arterial PO<T2>2</T2> at or below 55 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen saturation at orbelow 88 percent, taken <T3>during sleep </T3>for a patient who demonstrates an arterial PO<T2>2</T2> at or above 56 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen saturation at orabove 89 percent, while awake; or a greater than normal fall in oxygenlevel <T3>during sleep </T3>(a decrease in arterial PO<T2>2</T2> more than 10 mm Hg, or decrease in arterial oxygen saturationmore than 5 percent) associated with symptoms or signs reasonably attributableto hypoxemia (e.g., impairment of cognitive processes and nocturnal restlessnessor insomnia). In either of these cases, coverage is provided <T3>only </T3>for <T3>nocturnal </T3>use of oxygen.  (3) An arterial PO<T2>2</T2> at or below 55 mm Hg or an arterial oxygen saturation at orbelow 88 percent, taken <T3>during exercise </T3>for a patient who demonstrates an arterial PO<T2>2</T2> at or above 56 mm Hg, or an arterial oxygen saturation at orabove 89 percent, during the day while at rest. In this case, supplementaloxygen is provided for <T3>during exercise </T3>if there is evidence the use of oxygen improvesthe hypoxemia that was demonstrated during exercise when the patient wasbreathing room air.  b. <T3>Group II.</T3>_Except as modified in subsection d, coverage is availablefor patients whose arterial PO<T2>2</T2> is 56-59 mm Hg or whose arterial blood oxygen saturation is89 percent, <T3>if </T3>there is evidence of:  (1) Dependent edema suggesting congestive heart failure;  (2) ``P'' pulmonale on EKG (P wave greater than 3 mm in standard leadsII, III, or AVF); or  (3) Erythrocythemia with a hematocrit greater than 56 percent.  c. <T3>Group III.</T3>_Except as modified in subsection d, carriers <T3>must </T3>apply a rebuttable presumption that a home program of oxygenuse is not medically necessary for patients with arterial PO<T2>2</T2> levels at or above 60 mm Hg, or arterial blood oxygen saturationat or above 90 percent. In order for claims in this category to be reimbursed,the carrier's reviewing physician would need to review any documentationsubmitted in rebuttal of this presumption and grant specific approval ofthe claims. It is expected that very few claims will be approved for coveragein this category.  d.<T3> Variable Factors That May Affect Blood Gas Values</T3>._In reviewingarterial PO<T2>2</T2> levels and the arterial oxygen saturation percentages specifiedin subsections D, 3, a, b and c, the carrier's medical staff must takeinto account variations in oxygen measurements that may result from suchfactors as the patient's age, the altitude level, or the patient's decreasedoxygen carrying capacity.E.<T3> Portable Oxygen Systems</T3>._A patient meeting the requirements specifiedbelow may qualify for coverage of a portable oxygen system either (1) byitself or, (2) to complement a stationary oxygen system. A portable oxygensystem is covered for a particular patient if: andbullet; The claim meets the requirements specified in subsections A-D,as appropriate; and andbullet; The medical documentation includes a description of the activitiesor exercise routine (e.g., amount and frequency of ambulation) that thepatient undertakes on a regular basis, and that requires the portable systemin the home. The documentation must describe the medical therapeutic purposeto be served by the portable system that cannot be met by a stationarysystem.F.<T3> Patients Covered Under a Program of Home Oxygen as of September 30,1985</T3>._Patients who have already been determined by the carrier tobe covered under a program of home oxygen (either for stationary<T3> and</T3> portable systems or just a stationary system) as of September30, 1985, must meet the following requirements in order to continue toreceived coverage after that date:1.<T3> Medical Need Already Established</T3>._Where the carrier has alreadyreceived documentation of the medical need for oxygen services for suchpatients, as specified in subsections A-E, new documentation is not requiredregardless of when the existing documentation was submitted. However, thepatient's continuing need for oxygen services must be periodically verifiedas specified in Carriers Manual, Part 3, andSection; 4105.2.2.<T3> Medical Need Not Established</T3>._Where documentation of the medicalneed for oxygen services for such patients, as specified in subsectionsA-E, has not submitted to the appropriate carrier, the following provisionswill apply:a.<T3> Up to October 1, 1986</T3>._The carrier will continue to reimbursefor oxygen services furnished up to October 1, 1986. During this 12-monthgrace period, the carrier will continue to apply the local requirementsin effect before October 1, 1985 and will continue to verify the patient'smedical need for oxygen services according to the review procedures describedin Carriers Manual, Part 3, andSection; 4105.2.b.<T3> After October 1, 1986</T3>._Except as provided in subsection c, thecarrier will not reimburse for oxygen services furnished later than October1, 1986 unless: andbullet; the documentation specified in subsections A-E is submitted tothe carrier; and andbullet; the carrier makes a determination that the oxygen services arecovered.c.<T3> Exception</T3>._if the patient does not meet the criteria specifiedin subsections A-E, the carrier reimburses for oxygen services furnishedafter October 1, 1986<T3> only</T3> if: andbullet; There is a medical risk that the patient's condition could becomplicated by his withdrawal from oxygen (e.g., where the patient hasa physhological dependence on oxygen) and the attending physician certifiesthat there is a continuing medical need for the patient to receive oxygen;and andbullet; The carrier makes a determination that the services<T3> are</T3> covered.G.<T3> Respiratory Therapists</T3>._Respiratory therapists' services are<T3> not covered</T3> under the provisions for coverage of oxygen servicesunder the Part B durable medical equipment benefit as outlined above. Thisbenefit provides for coverage of home use of oxygen and oxygen equipment,but does not include a professional component in the delivery of such services.Cross-Refer: Intermediary Manual, Part 3, andSection;andSection; 3113ff; CarriersManual, Part 3, andSection;andSection; 2100ff; andSection; 60-9.<ITAG tagnum="81">60-5 POWER-OPERATED VEHICLES THAT MAY BE USED AS WHEELCHAIRS</ITAG>Power-operated vehicles that may be appropriately used as wheelchairs arecovered under the durable medical equipment provision.These vehicles have been appropriately used in the home setting for vocationalrehabilitation and to improve the ability of chronically disabled personsto cope with normal domestic, vocational and social activities. They maybe covered if a wheelchair is medically necessary and the patient is unableto operate a wheelchair manually.A specialist in physical medicine, orthopedic surgery, neuology, or rheumatologymust provide an evaluation of the patient's medical and physical conditionand a prescription for the vehicle to assure that the patient requiresthe vehicle and is capable of using it safely. Where an intermediary determinesthat such a specialist is not reasonably accessible, e.g., more than 1day's round trip from the beneficiary's home, or the patient's conditionprecludes such travel, a prescription from the beneficiary's physicianis acceptable.The intermediary's medical staff reviews all claims for a power-operatedvehicle, including the specialists' or other physicians' prescriptionsand evaluations of the patient's medical and physical conditions, to insurethat all coverage requirements are met.Cross-refer: Intermediary Manual, Part 3, andSection; 3643; see wheelchairsin andSection; 60-9.<ITAG tagnum="81">60-6 SPECIALLY SIZED WHEELCHAIRS </ITAG>Payment may be made for a specially sized wheelchair even though it ismore expensive than a standard wheelchair. For example, a narrow wheelchairmay be required because of the narrow doorways of a patient's home or becauseof a patient's slender build. Such difference in the size of the wheelchairfrom the standard model is not considered a deluxe feature. A physician's certification or prescription that a special size is neededis not required where you can determine from the information in file orother sources that a specially sized wheelchair (rather than a standardone) is needed to accommodate the wheelchair to the place of use or thephysical size of the patient. To determine the reasonable charge in these cases, use the criteria setout in Carriers Manual, andSection;andSection; 5022, 5022.1, 5200, and 5205,as necessary.

Accordingly, program payment may be made for the rental orpurchase of either of the following pacemaker monitors when it is prescribedby a physician for a patient with a cardiac pacemaker: A. <T3>Digitial Electronic Pacemaker Monitor._</T3>This device provides thepatient with an instantaneous digital readout of his pacemaker pulse rate.Use of this device does not involve professional services until there hasbeen a change of five pulses (or more) per minute above or below the initialrate of the pacemaker; when such change occurs, the patient contacts hisphysician. B. <T3>Audible/Visible Signal Pacemaker Monitor._</T3>This device producesan audible and visible signal which indicates the pacemaker rate. Use ofthis device does not involve professional services until a change occursin these signals; at such time, the patient contacts his physician. <T3>NOTE: </T3>The design of the self-contained pacemaker monitor makesit possible for the patient to monitor his pacemaker periodically and minimizesthe need for regular visits to the outpatient department of the provider.Therefore, documentation of the medical necessity for pacemaker evaluationin the outpatient department of the provider should be obtained where suchevaluation is employed in addition to the self-contained pacemaker monitorused by the patient in his home.

In establishing medical necessity for the seatlift, the evidence must show that the item is included in the physician'scourse of treatment, that it is likely to effect improvement, or arrestor retard deterioration in the patient's condition, and that the severityof the condition is such that the alternative would be chair or bed confinement.Coverage of seat lifts is limited to those types which operate smoothly,can be controlled by the patient, and effectively assist a patient in standingup and sitting down without other assistance. Excluded from coverage isthe type of lift which operates by a spring release mechanism with a sudden,catapult-like motion and jolts the patient from a seated to a standingposition. Limit the payment for units which incorporate a recliner featurealong with the seat lift to the amount payable for a seat lift withoutthis feature.

This section is designed to be used as aquick reference tool for determining the coverage status of certain piecesof DME and especially for those items which are commonly referred to byboth brand and generic names. The information contained herein is applicable(where appropriate) to all DME coverage determinations discussed in theDME portion of this manual. The list is organized into two columns. Thefirst column lists alphabetically various <T3>generic </T3>categories of equipment on which national coverage decisionshave been made by HCFA; and the second column notes the coverage statusof each equipment category. In the case of equipment categories that have been determined by HCFA tobe covered under the DME benefit, the list outlines the conditions of coveragethat must be met if payment is to be allowed for the rental or purchaseof the DME by a particular patient, or cross-refers to another sectionof the manual where the applicable coverage criteria are described in moredetail. With respect to equipment categories that cannot be covered asDME, the list includes a brief explanation of why the equipment is notcovered. This DME list will be updated periodically to reflect any additionalnational coverage decisions that HCFA may make with regard to other categoriesof equipment. When you receive a claim for an item of equipment which does not appearto fall logically into any of the <T3>generic </T3>categories listed, you have the authority and responsibilityfor deciding whether those items are covered under the DME benefit. Thesedecisions must be made by each contractor based on the advice of its medicalconsultants, taking into account: andbullet; The general DME coverage instructions in the Carriers Manual,andSection; 2100ff and Intermediary Manual, andSection; 3113ff (see below forbrief summary); andbullet; Whether the item has been approved for marketing by the Food andDrug Administration (FDA) (see Carriers Manual, andSection; 2303.1 and IntermediaryManual, andSection; 3151.1) and is otherwise generally considered to be safeand effective for the purpose intended; and andbullet; Whether the item is reasonable and necessary for the individualpatient.

Medicare coverage of these devicesvaries, both with respect to the type of device and the medical conditionof the patient for whom the device is prescribed.Reflectance colorimeter devices used for measuring blood glucose levelsin clinical settings are not covered as durable medical equipment for usein the home, because their need for frequent professional recalibrationmakes them unsuitable for home use. However, some types of blood glucosemonitors which use a reflectance meter specifically designed for home useby diabetic patients may be covered as durable medical equipment, subjectto the conditions and limitations described below.Blood glucose monitors are meter devices which ``read'' color changes producedon specially-treated reagent strips by glucose concentrations in the patient'sblood. The patient, using a disposable sterile lancet, draws a drop ofblood, places it on a reagent strip and, following instructions which mayvary with the device used, inserts it into the device to obtain a reading.Lancets, reagent strips and other supplies necessary for the proper functioningof the device are also covered for patients for whom the device is indicated.Home blood glucose monitors enable certain patients to better control theirblood glucose levels by frequently checking and appropriately contactingtheir attending physician for advice and treatment. Studies indicate thatthe patient's ability to carefully follow proper procedures is criticalto obtaining satisfactory results with these devices. In addition, thecost of the devices, with their supplies, limits economical use to patientswho must make frequent checks of their blood glucose levels. Accordingly,coverage of home blood glucose monitors is limited to patients meetingthe following conditions:andbullet; The patient must be an insulin-treated diabetic;andbullet; There must be documentation by a physician of poor diabetic control,i.e.,<ITAG tagnum="15">_widely fluctuating blood sugars before meal time;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_frequent episodes of insulin reactions; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_evidence of frequent significant ketosis;</ITAG>andbullet; The patient's physician states that the patient is capable ofbeing trained to use the particular device prescribed in an appropriatemanner. In some cases, the patient may not be able to perform this function,but a responsible family member can be trained to use the equipment andmonitor the patient to assure that the intended effect is achieved. Thisis permissible if the record is properly documented by the patient's physician;andandbullet; The device is designed for home rather than clinical use.The following devices are covered on or after December 26, 1984.There is also a blood glucose monitoring system designed especially foruse by those with visual impairments. The monitors used in such systemsare identical in terms of reliability and sensitivity to the standard bloodglucose monitors described above. They differ by having such features asvoice synthesizers, automatic timers, and specially designed arrangementsof supplies and materials to enable the visually-impaired to use the equipmentwithout assistance.These special blood glucose monitoring systems are covered under Medicareif the following conditions are met:andbullet; The patient and device meet the four conditions listed above forcoverage of standard home blood glucose monitors; andandbullet; The patient's physician certifies that he or she has a visualimpairment severe enough to require use of this special monitoring system.The additional features and equipment of these special systems justifya higher reimbursement amount than allowed for standard blood glucose monitors.Separately identify claims for such devices and establish a separate reimbursementamount for them. For those carriers using HCPCS, the procedure code anddefinition is: EO609_Blood Glucose Monitor_with special features (e.g.,voice synthesizers, automatic timer, etc.).<ITAG tagnum="81">60-14 INFUSION PUMPS</ITAG>The following indications for treatment using infusion pumps are coveredunder Medicare:A. <T3>External Infusion Pumps</T3>.(Effective for services performed on or after 9/26/84.)1. <T3>Iron Poisoning</T3>_When used in the administration of deferozaminefor the treatment of acute iron poisoning and iron overload, only externalinfusion pumps are covered.2. <T3>Thromboembolic Disease</T3>_When used in the administration of heparinfor the treatment of thromboembolic disease and/or pulmonary embolism,only external infusion pumps used in an institutional setting are covered.(NOTE: For end-state renal disease patients, see 60-1.)(Effective for services performed on or after 1/29/85.)3. <T3>Chemotherapy for Liver Cancer</T3>_The external chemotherapy infusionpump is covered when used in the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinomaor colorectal cancer where this disease is unresectable or where the patientrefuses surgical excision of the tumor.(Effective for services performed on or after 4/22/85.)4. <T3>Morphine for Intractable Cancer Pain</T3>_Morphine infusion via anexternal infusion pump is covered when used in the treatment of intractablepain caused by cancer (in either an inpatient or outpatient setting, includinga hospice).Other uses of external infusion pumps <T3>are covered </T3>if the contractor's medical staff verifies the appropriatenessof the therapy and of the prescribed pump for the individual patient.B. <T3>Implantable Infusion Pumps</T3>.(Effective for services performed on or after 9/26/84.)<T3>Chemotherapy for Liver Cancer.</T3>_The implantable infusion pump iscovered for intra-arterial infusion of 5-FUdR for the treatment of livercancer for patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma or Duke's ClassD colorectal cancer, in whom the matastases are limited to the liver, andwhere (1) the disease is unresectable or (2) where the patient refusessurgical of the tumor.NOTE: Payment may also be made for drugs necessary for the effective useof the pump, as long as the drug being used with the pump is itself reasonableand necessary for the patient's treatment.The following indications for treatment using infusion pumps are <T3>not</T3> covered under Medicare:A. <T3>External Infusion Pumps </T3>(Effective for services performed on or after 1/29/85.)<T3>Diabetes_</T3>The use of an external infusion pump for the subcutaneousinfusion of insulin in the treatment of diabetes is not covered.B. <T3>Implantable Infusion Pump</T3>(Effective for services performed on or after 9/26/84.)<T3>Thromboembolic Disease._</T3>According to the Public Health Service,there is insufficient published clinical data to support the safety andeffectiveness of the heparin implantable pump. Therefore, the use of animplantable infusion pump for infusion of heparin in the treatment of recurrentthromboembolic disease is not covered.Other uses of the implanted infusion pump are currently under investigationby the Public Health Service and would still be considered experimental,and therefore not covered under Medicare.<ITAG tagnum="81">60-15 SAFETY ROLLER</ITAG>(Effective for claims adjudicated on or after 6/3/85.)``Safety roller'' is the generic name applied to devices for patients whocannot use standard wheeled walkers. They may be appropriate, and thereforecovered, for some patients who are obese, have severe neurological disorders,or restricted use of one hand, which makes it impossible to use a wheeledwalker that does not have the sophisticated braking system found on safetyrollers.In order to assure that payment is not made for a safety roller when aless expensive standard wheeled walker would satisfy the patient's medicalneeds, carriers will refer safety roller claims to their medical consultants.The medical consultant will determine whether some or all of the featuresprovided in a safety roller are necessary, and therefore covered and reimbursable.If it is determined that the patient could use a standard wheeled walker,the charge for the safety roller will be reduced to the charge of a standardwheeled walker.Some obese patients who could use a standard wheeled walker if their weightdid not exceed the walker's strength and stability limits can have it reinforcedand its wheel base expanded. Such modifications are routine mechanicaladjustments and justify a moderate surcharge. In these cases the carrierwill reduce the charge for the safety roller to the charge for the standardwheeled walker plus the surcharge for modifications.In the case of patients with medical documentation showing severe neurologicaldisorders or restricted use of one hand which makes it impossible for themto use a wheeled walker that does not have a sophisticated braking system,a reasonable charge for the safety roller may be determined without relatingit to the reasonable charge for a standard wheeled walker. (Such reasonablecharge should be developed in accordance with the instructions in MedicareCarriers Manual andSection;andSection; 5010 and 5205.)Cross Refer: Carriers Manual andSection;andSection; 2100ff., andSection; 60-9.<ITAG tagnum="81">60-16 LYMPHEDEMA PUMPS.</ITAG>Non-segmental lymphedema pumps are currently covered under the Medicareprogram.

It is a relativelyuncommon, chronic condition which may be due to many causes; e.g., surgicalremoval of lymph nodes, post-radiation fibrosis, scarring of lymphaticchannels onset of puberty (Milroy's Disease), congenital anomalies, etc.Both the segmental and non-segmental type pumps are appropriate for usein the home for the treatment of intractable lymphedema of the extremities.However, they may be covered only as a prescription item with appropriatephysician oversight; i.e., physician evaluation of the patient's conditionto determine medical necessity of the device, and suitable instructionin the operation of the machine as to the pressure to be used and the frequencyand duration of use.Cross Refer: andSection; 60-9.<ITAG tagnum="81">60-17 CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (CPAP)</ITAG>(Effective for Claims Adjudicated on and After January 12, 1987.)CPAP is a non-invasive technique for providing low levels of air pressurefrom a flow generator, via a nose mask, through the nares. The purposeis to prevent the collapse of the oropharyngeal walls and the obstructionof airflow during sleep, which occurs in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).The diagnosis of OSA requires documentation of at least 30 episodes ofapnea, each lasting a minimum of 10 seconds, during 6-7 hours of recordedsleep. The use of CPAP is covered under Medicare when used in adult patientswith moderate or severe OSA for whom surgery is a likely alternative toCPAP.Initial claims must be supported by medical documentation (separate documentationwhere electronic billing is used), such as a prescription written by thepatient's attending physician, that specifies:A diagnosis of moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea, andSurgery is a likely alternative.The claim must also certify that the documentation supporting a diagnosisof OSA (described above) is available.Cross Refer: andSection; 60-9.<ITAG tagnum="81">60-18 HOSPITAL BEDS</ITAG>A. <T3>General Requirements for Coverage of Hospital Beds.</T3>_A physician'sprescription, and such additional documentation as the contractors' medicalstaffs may consider necessary, including medical records and physicians'reports, must establish the medical necessity for a hospital bed due toone of the following reasons:andbullet; The patient's condition requires positioning of the body; e.g.,to alleviate pain, promote good body alignment, prevent contractures, avoidrespiratory infections, in ways not feasible in an ordinary bed; or andbullet; The patient's condition requires special attachments that cannotbe fixed and used on an ordinary bed.B. <T3>Physician's Prescription.</T3>_The physician's prescription, whichmust accompany the initial claim, and supplementing documentation whenrequired, must establish that a hospital bed is medically necessary.

Where an eye has been rendered sightlessand shrunken by inflammatory disease, a scleral shell may, among otherthings, obviate the need for surgical enucleation and prosthetic implantand act to support the surrounding orbital tissue.In such a case, the device serves essentially as an artificial eye. Inthis situation, payment may be made for a scleral shell under andSection;1861(s)(8) of the law.Scleral shells are occasionally used in combination with artifical tearsin the treatment of ``dry eye'' of diverse etiology. Tears ordinarily dryat a rapid rate, and are continually replaced by the lacrimal gland. Whenthe lacrimal gland fails, the half-life of artifical tears may be greatlyprolonged by the use of the scleral contact lens as a protective barrieragainst the drying action of the atmosphere. Thus, the difficult and sometimeshazardous process of frequent installation of arifical tears may be avoided.The lens acts in this instance to substitute, in part, for the functioningof the diseased lacrimal gland and would be covered as a prosthetic devicein the rare case when it is used in the treatment of ``dry eye.''Cross-refer: HCFA-Pub. 13-3, andSection;andSection; 3110.4, 3110.5; HCFA-Pub.14-3, andSection;andSection; 2130, 2133; HCFA-Pub. 10, andSection;andSection; 210.4,211<ITAG tagnum="81">65-4 CAROTID SINUS NERVE STIMULATOR</ITAG>Implanation of the carotid sinus nerve stimulator is indicated for reliefof angina pectoris in carefully selected patients who are refractory tomedical therapy <T3>and </T3>who after undergoing coronary angiography study either arepoor candidates for or refuse to have coronary bypass surgery.

Services rendered forpacemaker implanations on or after the effective dates of this instructionare subject to the guidelines of this section.These guidelines are based on certain assumptions regarding the clinicalgoals of pacemaker implantation. While some uses of pacemakers representrelatively certain or unambiguous usage, many others require considerableexpertise and judgment.Consequently, the medical necessity for pacemaker implantation must beviewed in the context of the overall management of the particular patient.The appropriateness of such implants may be conditional on other diagnosticor therapeutic modalities having been undertaken. Although significantcomplications and adverse side effects of pacemakers are relatively rare,they cannot be ignored when considering the use of pacemakers for dubiousmedical conditions, or marginal clinical benefit.These guidelines represent current concepts regarding medical circumstancesin which pacemaker implantation may be appropriate or necessary. As withother areas of medicine, advances in knowledge and techniques in cardiologyare expected. Consequently, judgments about the medical necessity and acceptabilityof pacemaker implants can be expected to change, and instructions modifiedas more information becomes available.It should be noted that this instruction applies only to permanent, implantedpacemakers, and does not address the use of temporary, nonimplanted pacemakers.The two groups of conditions outlined below deal with the necessity forcardiac pacemaker implants for patients in general. These are intendedas guidelines for Medicare contractors to use in assessing the medicalnecessity of claims for pacemaker implantation. As with other guidelines,final coverage determinations must take account of the circumstances ofthe particular claim, as well as factors such as the medical history ofthe individual patient. However, as a general rule, contractors may viewthe two groups of current medical concepts below as representing:<T3>Group I: </T3>Single-Chamber Cardiac Pacemakers_(A) conditions underwhich single-chamber pacemaker claims may be considered covered withoutfurther claims development; and (B) conditions under which single-chamberpacemaker claims would be denied unless further claims development showsthat they fall into the covered category, or special medical circumstancesexist sufficient to convince the contractor that the claim should be paid.<T3>Group II. </T3>Dual-Chamber Cardiac Pacemakers_(A) conditions underwhich dual-chamber pacemaker claims may be considered covered without furtherclaims development, and (B) conditions under which dual-chamber pacemakerclaims would be denied unless further claims development shows that theyfall into the covered categories for single-and dual chamber pacemakers,or special medical circumstances exist sufficient to convince the contractorthat the claim should be paid.<T3>GROUP I: </T3>SINGLE-CHAMBER CARDIAC PACEMAKERS_Effective for servicesrendered on or after March 16, 1983.A. <T3>COVERED.</T3>Conditions under which implantation of a cardiac pacemaker is generallyconsidered acceptable or necessary, provided that the conditions are chronicor recurrent and not due to transient causes such as acute myocardial infarction,drug toxicity, or electrolyte imbalance.

These people must rely on either enteralor parenteral nutritional therapy, depending upon the particular natureof their medical condition.Coverage of nutritional therapy as a Part B benefit is provided under theprosthetic device benefit provision, which requires that the patient musthave a permanently inoperative internal body organ or function thereof(see 3110.4). Therefore, enteral and parenteral nutritional therapy isnot covered under Part B in situations involving temporary impairments.Coverage of such therapy, however, does not require a medical judgmentthat the impairment giving rise to the therapy will persist throughoutthe patient's remaining years. If the medical record, including the judgmentof the attending physician, indicates that the impairment will be of longand indefinite duration, the test of permanence will be considered met.If the coverage requirements for enteral or parenteral nutritional therapyare met under the prosthetic device benefit provision, related supplies,equipment and nutrients are also covered under the conditions in the followingparagraphs and andSection; 3110.4.65-10.1 <T3>Parenteral Nutrition Therapy.</T3>_Daily parenteral nutrition is consideredreasonable and necessary for a patient with severe pathology of the alimentarytract which does not allow absorption of sufficient nutrients to maintainweight and strength commensurate with the patient's general condition.Since the alimentary tract of such a patient does not function adequately,an indwelling catheter is placed percutaneously in the subclavian veinand then advanced into the supeiror vena cava where intravenous infusionof nutrients is given for part of the day. The catheter is then pluggedby the patient until the next infusion. Following a period of hospitalization,which is required to initiate parenteral nutrition and to train the patientin catheter care, solution preparation, and infusion technique, the parenteralnutrition can be provided safely and effectively in the patient's homeby nonprofessional persons who have undergone special training. However,such persons cannot be reimbursed for their services, nor is reimbursementavailable for any services furnished by nonphysician professionals exceptas services furnished incident to a physician's service.For parenteral nutrition therapy to be covered under Part B, the claimmust contain a physician's written order or prescription, and sufficientmedical documentation to permit an independent conclusion that the requirementsof the prosthetic device benefit are met and that parenteral nutritiontherapy is medically necessary. An example of a condition that would typicallyqualify for coverage is a massive small bowel resection resulting in severenutritional deficiency in spite of adequate oral intake. However, coverageof parenteral nutrition therapy for this and any other condition must beapproved on an individual, case-by-case basis initially and at periodicintervals of no more than 3 months by the carrier's medical consultantor specially trained staff, relying on such medical and other documentationas the carrier may require. If the claim involves an infusion pump, sufficientevidence must be provided to support a determination of medical necessityfor the pump. Program reimbursement for the pump will be based on the reasonablecharge for the simplest model that meets the medical needs of the patientas established by medical documentation (see andSection; 3113.2B).Nutrient solutions for parenteral therapy are routinely covered. HoweverMedicare will pay for no more than one months supply of nutrients at anyone time. Reimbursement for the nutrients is based on the reasonable chargefor the solution components unless the medical record, including a signedstatement from the attending physician, establishes that the beneficiary,due to his physical or mental state, is unable to safely or effectivelymix the solution and there is no family member or other person who cando so. Payment will be on the basis of the reasonable charge for more expensivepre-mixed solutions only under the latter circumstances.65-10.2 <T3>Enteral Nutrition Therapy.</T3>_Enteral nutrition is considered reasonableand necessary for a patient with a functioning gastrointestinal tract who,due to pathology to or nonfunction of the structures that normally permitfood to reach the digestive tract, cannot maintain weight and strengthcommensurate with his or her general condition. Enteral therapy may begiven by nasogastric, jejunostomy, or gastrostomy tubes, and can be providedsafely and effectively in the home by nonprofessional persons who haveundergone special training. However, such persons cannot be reimbursedfor their services, nor is reimbursement available for any services furnishedby nonphysician professionals except as services furnished incident toa physician's service.Typical examples of conditions that would qualify for coverage are headand neck cancer with reconstructive surgery, and central nervous systemdisease leading to interference with the neuromuscular mechanisms of ingestionof such severity that the beneficiary cannot be maintained with oral feeding.However claims for Part B coverage of enteral nutrition therapy for theseand any other conditions must be approved on an individual, case-by-casebasis. Each claim must contain a physician's written order or prescription,and sufficient medical documentation (e.g., hospital records, clinicalfindings from the attending physician, etc.) to permit an independent conclusionthat the patient's condition meets the requirements of the prosthetic devicebenefit and that enteral nutrition therapy is medically necessary. Allowedclaims are to be reviewed at periodic intervals of no more than 3 monthsby the contractor's medical consultant or specially trained staff, andadditional medical documentation considered necessary should be obtainedas part of this review.Medicare will pay for no more than one months supply of enteral nutrientsat any one time.If the claim involves a pump, it must be supported by sufficient medicaldocumentation to establish that the pump is medically necessary, i.e.,gravity feeding is not satisfactory due to aspiration, diarrhea, dumpingsyndrome, etc. Program reimbursement for the pump will be based on thereasonable charge for the simplest model that meets the medical needs ofthe patient as established by medical documentation (see andSection;andSection;3113.2).65-10.3 <T3>Nutritional Supplementation.</T3>_Some patients require supplementationof their daily protein and caloric intake.

These devices (commonly known asbladder stimulators or pacemakers) are characterized by the implantationof electrodes in the wall of the bladder, the rectal cones, or the spinalcord. While these treatments may effectively empty the bladder, the issueof safety involving the initiation of infection, erosion, placement, andmaterial selection has not been resolved. Further, some facilities previouslyusing electronic emptying have stopped using this method due to the painexperienced by the patient.The use of spinal cord electrical stimulators, rectal electrical stimulators(including the Continaid), and bladder wall stimulators (including theMentor Bladder Pacemaker) cannot be considered reasonable and necessary.Therefore, no program payment may be made for these devices or for theirimplantation.<ITAG tagnum="81">65-13 PHRENIC NERVE STIMULATOR </ITAG>The implantation of a phrenic nerve stimulator is covered for selectedpatients with partial or complete respiratory insufficiency.

The device has been used successfully totreat hypoventilation caused by a variety of conditions, including respiratoryparalysis resulting from lesions of the brain stem and cervical spinalcord and chronic pulmonary disease with ventilatory insufficiency. Thephrenic nerve stimulator is intended to be an alternative to managementof patients with respiratory insufficiency who are dependent upon the usualtherapy of intermittent or permanent use of a mechanical ventilator aswell as maintenance of a permanent tracheotomy stoma. However, an implanted phrenic nerve stimulator can be effective only ifthe patient has an intact phrenic nerve and diaphragm. Moreover, nerveinjury may occur during the surgical procedure and if sufficient injuryis incurred, the device will not prove useful to the patient. Consequently,it is possible for such a device to be indicated for a patient but, dueto injury sustained during implant, fail to assist the patient, resultingin a return to the use of mechanical ventilation.<ITAG tagnum="81">65-14 COCHLEAR IMPLANTATION </ITAG>(Effective for services performed on and after October 1, 1986.)

(Section 1862(a)(8) of the Act excludes payment fororthopedic shoes or other supportive devices for the feet.)Cross-refer: Intermediary Manual, andSection; 3110.5; Carriers Manual, andSection;2133; Hospital Manual, andSection; 228.5<ITAG tagnum="81">80 PATIENT EDUCATION PROGRAMS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">81-1 INSTITUTIONAL AND HOME CARE PATIENT EDUCATION PROGRAMS</ITAG>While the law does not specifically identify patient education programsas covered services, reimbursement may be made under Medicare for suchprograms furnished by providers of services (i.e., hospitals, SNFs, HHAs,and OPT providers) to the extent that the programs are appropriate, integralparts in the rendition of covered services which are reasonable and necessaryfor the treatment of the individual's illness or injury. For example, educationalactivities carried out by nurses-teaching patients to give themselves injections,follow prescribed diets, administer colostomy care, administer medicalgases, and carry out other inpatient care activities_may be reimbursableas a part of covered routine nursing care. Also, the teaching by an occupationaltherapist of compensatory techniques to improve a patient's level of independencein the activities of daily living may be reimbursed as a part of coveredoccupational therapy. Similarly, the instruction of a patient in the carryingout of a maintenance program designed for him by a physical therapist maybe reimbursed as part of covered physical therapy.However, where the educational activities are not closely related to thecare and treatment of the patient, such as programs directed toward instructingpatients or the public generally in preventive health care activities,reimbursement cannot be made since the law limits Medicare payment to coveredcare which is reasonable and necessary for the treatment of an illnessor injury. For example, programs designed to prevent illness by instructingthe general public in the importance of good nutritional habits, exerciseregimens, and good hygiene are not reimbursable under the program.<ITAG tagnum="81">90 NURSING SERVICES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">90-1 HOME HEALTH VISITS TO A BLIND DIABETIC</ITAG>Many individuals who are blind and require daily insulin for the controlof a diabetic condition are able to administer their injections withoutassistance (other than possibly that which may be furnished by family membersor friends). There are organizations which encourage and train blind diabetics,both to fill their own syringes and to inject themselves. There are alsoa number of devices available for blind individuals to fill their syringesaccurately. However, the individuals who may need assistance with prefillingtheir syringes may also require periodic observation and evaluation, eventhough their diabetes is fairly stabilized. In such cases, probably fewin number, home health services may be required for this purpose.To qualify for home health benefits, a blind diabetic must be confinedto his home, under the care of a physician, and a need of either skillednursing services on an intermittent basis or physical therapy or speechtherapy. Effective July 1, 1981, a person may qualify for home health benefitsbased on his or her need for skilled nursing services on an intermittentbasis, physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy. EffectiveDecember 1, 1981, occupational therapy is eliminated as a basis for entitlementto home health services. However, if a person has otherwise qualified forhome health services because of the need for skilled nursing care, physicaltherapy or speech therapy, the patient's eligibility for home health servicesmay be extended solely on the basis of the continuing need for occupationaltherapy. (See Intermediary Manual, andSection;3116; Home Health Agency Manual,andSection;203; Hospital Manual, andSection;155.3.) There must be a plan oftreatment, established and periodically reviewed by a physician, whichindicates that there is a recurring need for home health services to supplementthe physician's contacts with the patient; e.g., skilled nursing visitsfor observing and determining the need for changes in the level and typeof care which has been prescribed. (See Intermediary Manual, andSection;3117ff;Home Health Agency Manual, andSection;204ff.) Once an initial regimen hasbeen established, the frequency of need for further home health servicescan vary greatly from patient to patient, depending on their conditionand the likelihood of its changing. Some may need visits only every 90days, for example, while others may require them much more frequently.If a nurse makes a visit to provide skilled services, and also prefillssyringes, the purpose of the visit, which was to provide skilled services,does not change. However, if the sole purpose of the nurse's visit is toprefil insulin syringes for a blind diabetic, it is not a skilled nursingvisit although it may be reimbursed as such as indicated below.Filling a syringe can be safely and effectively performed by the averagenonmedical person without the direct supervision of a licensed nurse. Consequently,it would not constitute a skilled nursing service even if it is performedby a nurse. (See Intermediary Manual, andSection;3117.2B; Home Health AgencyManual, andSection;204.2B.) The personal care duties normally performed byhome health aides include assisting the patient with medications orderedby a physician which are ordinarily self-administered. (See IntermediaryManual, andSection;3119.2; Home Health Agency Manual, andSection;206.2.) Performanceof such a service by an aide is consistent with the Medicare conditionsof participation for home health agencies. Therefore, home health aideservices would be appropriate for those blind diabetics who are qualifiedfor home health benefits and who cannot fill their syringes. An adequatelytrained home health aide could make intermittent visits, usually on a weeklybasis, to the home for the purpose of filling that supply of insulin orderedby the physician.If State law, however, precludes a home health aide from prefilling insulinsyringes, payment may be made for this service as part of the cost of skillednursing services when performed by a nurse for a blind diabetic who isotherwise unable to prefill his or her syringes. There are no adverse consequenceswith respect to reimbursement to the home health agency for providing theservice in this manner.If State law does not preclude a home health aide from prefilling insulinsyringes, but the home health agency chooses to send a nurse to performonly this task, the visit is reimbursed as if made by a home health aide.NOTE: As indicated, to qualify for home health benefits, a patient mustrequire skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis or physical therapyor speech therapy. If a beneficiary does not qualify for home health benefitsbut only needs someone to prefill syringes with the correct dosage of insulin,then no program payment can be made.Cross-refer: Intermediary Manual, andSection;andSection;3116, 3117.2B, 3117ff,3119.2; Home Health Agency Manual, andSection;andSection;203, 204ff, 204.2B,206.<ITAG tagnum="81">90-2 HOME HEALTH NURSES' VISITS TO PATIENTS REQUIRING HEPARIN INJECTIONS</ITAG>Professional medical advice indicates that subcutaneous injections of lowdose heparin can be, under certain circumstances, medically accepted therapyfor the treatment of recurrent deep venous thrombosis, recurrent pulmonaryemboli, and other conditions requiring long term anticoagulation. The usualdrug of choice for these conditions is warfarin. Heparin may be substitutedfor warfarin in circumstances such as demonstrated warfarin sensitivity.Heparin is now the drug of choice for anticagulation during pregnancy.Medicare payment may be made for several visits by the home health nurseto teach the patient or the caring person to give subcutaneous injectionsof low dose heparin if it is prescribed by a physician for a homeboundpatient who: (1) is pregnant and requires anticoagulant therapy, or (2)requires treatment for deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary emboli or foranother condition requiring anticoagulation and documentation justifiesthat the patient cannot tolerate warfarin. If the patient or caring personis unable to administer the injection, nursing visits to give the injectionson a daily basis, 7 days a week, for a period of up to 6 months (in thecase of pregnancy, visits may be made for a period beyond 6 months if reasonableand necessary) would be reimbursed by Medicare. Coverage for these servicesafter 6 months of treatment would be provided only if the prescribing physiciancan justify and document the need for such an extended course of treatment.Documentation of need for heparin injections beyond 6 months would notbe required for pregnant patients who meet the homebound criteria.Cross-refer: Intermediary Manual, andSection;andSection;3117.4B, 31174H.1;Home
