U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell scheduled the hearing asthe jury selection process resumed and the judge added two people tothe pool of prospective jurors, bringing the total to 34.   He rejected three others, including a woman who knew someone whowas on a grand jury that has investigated the Iran-Contra affair.Another woman rejected for the pool said she ``heard it in passing.It was all over the news.''   One woman sent into the jury pool is an office clerk who said sherecalled seeking a July 1987 magazine with North's picture on thecover, but didn't recognize North in the courtroom and when askedwhether she had heard of him said, ``No, I never have.''   Another woman approved for the jury pool said she had seen Northon television in his Marine uniform. That drew objections from Northattorney Barry Simon, who suggested she had been exposed to thefired White House aide's immunized congressional testimony in 1987.Gesell, however, said that ``while she saw, she did not listen'' towhat was being said.   Gesell scheduled the closed-door hearing at the request of thehead of the prosecution team, John Keker, who apparently was actingon behalf of the intelligence community in the Bush administration.   Gesell said only that the hearing would deal with objections bythe office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh ``to one of myearlier orders.'' It was understood that the matter pertained toclassified information.   Keker said Walsh and a representative of the Justice Departmentwanted to be at the hearing, to which Gesell readily agreed,responding: ``I have been trying to get the Department of Justicehere without too much success.''   Last Thursday, Keker asked on behalf of the Justice Departmentand intelligence agencies that they be provided with four seats inthe courtroom during the trial. Gesell agreed, but said he wasconcerned that ``security gurus'' would try to run the case.   The National Security Agency made strong objections late lastmonth to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh over classifiedinformation that would be presented in the case and said itwarranted blocking the trial. Thornburgh rejected the NSA'ssuggestion.   Gesell's remarks today came as 39 additional prospective jurorswere sworn in, some of whom will undergo questioning on how muchthey know about North and the Iran-Contra affair. If they were notexposed to North's immunized congressional testimony in 1987, theylikely will be placed in a pool from which a jury is to be chosenlater this week.      Thirty-four people have been approved for the jury pool since thetrial began last Tuesday and Gesell wants to have a group of 45 fromwhich to choose 12 jurors and six alternates.   The jury pool's lack of knowledge, and interest, in theIran-Contra affair marks them as unusual. Out of the first 104jurors who came into the courtroom, just 31 said they hadn'twatched, listened or read about North's 1987 testimony to Congressin which he detailed many of the activities for which he is nowaccused of crimes.   A number of the prospective jurors who were approved for the jurypool by Gesell have said they recall hearing somewhere aboutshredding of documents in connection with the Iran-Contra affair orNorth, but recall nothing more than that.   Three counts of the 12 criminal charges against North allege thathe destroyed documents to conceal aid to the Contras and the Reaganadministration's sale of arms to Iran.   Most of the prospective jurors said they simply glance atfront-page newspaper headlines and switch channels or don't payattention when the news comes on.   They said they are too busy with jobs or occupied with otherinterests to have paid much attention to the biggest foreign policydebacle of the Reagan administration.   Most are blue- or pink-collar workers, several with thegovernment, while several others are unemployed or retired. Onewoman is holding down two jobs.   Of the first 25 prospective jurors, a dozen finished the 12thgrade, one has a master's degree, two others finished college andanother has some college education.   Their occupations range from cement finisher to mental healthadministrator.   North is accused of allegedly concealing from Congress in 1985and 1986 his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and ofcovering up from the attorney general the National SecurityCouncil's role in diverting money from the Iran arms sales to theContras.   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 securitysystem at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting tohis own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leaderAdolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenuein connection with contributions to the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
