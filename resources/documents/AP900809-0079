ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An ``art ambulance'' carrying coffinscontaining once-banned books and paintings tours Bostonneighborhoods. A reproduction of Rodin's famous sculpture, ``TheThinker,'' is covered daily with a shroud in San Francisco.   A jazz funeral is held at the New Orleans Museum of Art. Curtainspeeches are given at New York Shakespeare Festival performances inCentral Park. Brochures mailed by the Virginia Symphony depictMichelangelo's statue of David with the slogan ``Banned in theU.S.A.?'' pasted over his genitals.   Across the country this summer, the arts community is belatedlymobilizing public support for the National Endowment for the Artsin the escalating brouhaha over federal financing of controversialart.   Characteristically slow to anger, arts supporters have begunstriking back at conservative members of Congress and religiousfundamentalists who accuse the NEA of subsidizing obscene andblasphemous art with taxpayers' funds.   Concert audiences, theatergoers and visitors to museums and artgalleries are being recruited as foot soldiers in the artsadvocates' battle to protect the NEA from serious damage this fallwhen Congress debates extending the life of the $171 millionfederal arts agency.   Pamphlets labeled ``Be Quiet and the Arts Will Just Go Away''are being handed to theater patrons in Chicago, courtesy of theIllinois Arts Alliance. Inside are cutout post cards urgingsenators and House members to support the NEA, and this warning:   ``A small faction of politicians and extreme right-wingers wantto eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, which providesgovernment support for artists and arts institutions in the UnitedStates. This minority is well organized and vocal. Their side iswinning.''   In Baltimore, patrons of Baltimore Symphony Orchestra concerts,Center Stage plays and Maryland Art Place exhibition openings areasked to write members of Congress, sign petitions and dial aspecial 900 telephone number appealing for a five-year extension ofthe NEA, without any anti-obscenity restrictions on the grants itawards.   ``It's now time for us to stand up,'' said Philip Arnoult,director of the Theater Project in Baltimore.   The League of American Theaters and Producers in New Yorkpublished a pro-NEA editorial in Playbills that have reached anestimated 1 million theatergoers. The Metropolitan Arts Commissionin Portland, Ore., working with Mayor Bud Clark, won theendorsement of the U.S. Conference of Mayors for a letter toCongress urging no-strings support for the endowment.   Besides the ``art ambulance'' and a multimedia ``Caravan forFreedom of Expression'' van that has toured Boston neighborhoods,arts supporters there have circulated a ``Declaration of CulturalRights'' that opposes what they view as threatened governmentcensorship of the arts.   A full-page advertisement in the Boston Globe last month,featuring a once-controversial John Singer Sargent portrait of awoman with a plunging neckline, resulted in 1,000 calls urgingmembers of Congress to support the NEA, the ad's sponsors said.   An estimated 5,000 patrons of San Francisco Bay Area bookstoressigned letters petitioning Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., to voteagainst anti-obscenity curbs on the endowment. Rodin's ``TheThinker'' was shrouded for an hour every day during a 12-day``Festival for Freedom of Expression'' in San Francisco that wasbacked by more than 200 arts organizations.   Bob Lynch, director of the non-profit National Association ofLocal Arts Agencies, said his organization's 900-number campaignhas yielded an estimated 100,000 mailgrams and perhaps ahalf-million personal calls and letters to Capitol Hill in supportof the endowment.   Although the NEA's conservative critics are heavily financed,Lynch said, ``we will ultimately win because it is becoming clearthat Americans recognize the value of the arts and the endowment,and are not people who respond blindly to the other side's appealsto `stop sin'.''   The House has agreed to begin debate on the arts endowment'sfate in September, when it will consider Republican-led proposalsto restrict the agency's grant-making authority, shift the bulk ofits grant money to state control or abolish the NEA altogether.   ``Time is of the essence,'' said Anne Murphy, executive directorof the non-profit American Arts Alliance, a national arts advocacycoalition. ``Every individual who calls, writes or meets personallywith a member of Congress really does help.''</TEXT></DOC>
