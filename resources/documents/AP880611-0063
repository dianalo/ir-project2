The Khian Sea is en route to the Cape Verde Islands, and fromthere it will go to an undisclosed destination in West Africa, saidits operator, the Amalgamated Shipping Co. of Freeport, the Bahamas.   In a June 3 letter to the Environmental Protection Agency,Amalgamated Shipping said the Khian Sea was proceeding ``underreduced speed'' to the islands west of Senegal to await furtherorders.   The company said it had a representative in West Africanegotiating for the discharge of the ash, which came from cityincinerators.   The Organization of African Unity has called plans by developedcountries to dump their wastes ``a crime against Africa andAfricans,'' and the Greenpeace environmental group said in a reportlast week that shipping waste to Africa was a growing trend.   ``In particular, Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America havebecome the preferred dumping grounds of waste peddlers fromindustrialized countries,'' Greenpeace said.   On Thursday, Guinean officials announced that they had jailed aNorwegian official and several Guinean employees of the Ministry ofCommerce for bringing 15,000 tons of Philadelphia ash into thecountry.   ``If the Khian Sea is planning to go to West Africa, if theseguys are thinking of marketing their material there, their timingis way off,'' said Peter Christich, an official in the EPA'sinternational affairs office.   The Khian Sea left Philadelphia in October 1986 loaded withabout 15,000 tons of incinerator ash. It has been rejected by theBahamas, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Haiti and Guinea-Bissau.It unloaded about 4,000 tons of ash in Haiti before being orderedout of the country.   It returned to the Delaware Bay on March 1 with the intention oftaking the ash back to Philadelphia. But negotiations broke downwith the contractor who was to dispose of the ash, Joseph Paolino andamp;Sons, and the ship left May 22.   In March, A.S. Bulkhandling, Inc., a Norwegian shipping company,said it had taken 15,000 tons of Philadelphia incinerator ash toGuinea to be used in making construction material. The ash wasdumped on the island of Kassa, off the Guinean coast.   By May, the Guinean government formally requested that the ashbe removed. Bulkhandling officials tried to convince the governmentthat the ash was not harmful, but it was not convinced and set aMay 20 deadline to remove the ash.   The ash was not taken away, and on Thursday, the governmentannounced that Norway's consul general had been arrested forcomplicity in the secret dumping of what it called 15,000 tons oftoxic waste from the United States.   Ibrahima Sory Diaby, Guinean secretary of state for security,said the waste was shipped from Philadelphia. City officials havesaid that the ash is not harmful.</TEXT></DOC>
