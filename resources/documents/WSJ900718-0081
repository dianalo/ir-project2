Acting under a court order, the department's OccupationalSafety and Health Administration proposed cutting thepermissible exposure limit for asbestos in the workplace inhalf. The new limit would be an average of 0.1 fiber percubic centimeter of air over an eight-hour period.</LP><TEXT>   The short-term limit would remain at an average of onefiber per cubic centimeter of air over a 30-minute period.   OSHA believes the proposed new level &quot;will significantlyreduce worker deaths from cancer resulting from exposure toasbestos,&quot; said Assistant Secretary of Labor Gerard Scannell,who heads the agency. The standard would cover about 706,000employees in general industry, mostly in auto repair, and asmany as 1.4 million workers in construction, includingbuilding renovation and maintenance, OSHA said.   In 1986, OSHA reduced the maximum level for asbestos fromtwo fibers to 0.2 fiber per cubic centimeter of air, butlabor unions sought a lower limit. A federal district courtin February 1988 told the agency to re-examine severalissues, including the maximum permissible exposure level.   Responding to the court order, OSHA also proposedrequirements for specific controls over asbestos inactivities such as automobile brake and clutch service,regardless of the exposure level. It also proposed requiringowners of buildings in which demolition, renovation andasbestos-removal are conducted to notify employers, workersand OSHA of activities involving asbestos and how they planto trim exposure risks.   The agency also proposed to expand a requirement thatconstruction companies employ individuals trained to ensurecompliance with the standard; to require more stringentcleanup by asbestos-removal companies; to ban high-speedbuffing of asbestos floor tile; to narrow an exemption forsmall-scale, short-duration operations; and to add limitedexemptions for roofing, floor-tile removal and operations inwhich it isn't feasible to erect a protective enclosure forworkers.   The proposal would eliminate a requirement that employersbegin monitoring workers' health when exposure to asbestos isat half the maximum level allowed. OSHA said it doesn'tbelieve it's technologically feasible to measure exposure athalf the proposed level of 0.1 fiber per cubic centimeter ofair. So, it will continue to require monitoring at the 0.1fiber level.   OSHA proposed allowing manufacturers to use respiratoryequipment for workers to meet the reduced levels until thoseemployers can no longer use asbestos under a plannedphase-out of the material in manufacturing. The EnvironmentalProtection Agency has ordered the phase-out, which is due tobe in full effect in August 1996. Construction firms wouldhave to use engineering controls.   OSHA will accept comments on the proposal postmarkedthrough Sept. 25, and it plans a hearing on Oct. 23.</TEXT></DOC>
