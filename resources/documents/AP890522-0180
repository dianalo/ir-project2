The attempted demonstration came three days after PresidentMengistu Haile Mariam's government crushed a coup led by seniorgenerals, including the armed forces chief of staff and commanderof the air force.   A diplomat in the Ethiopian capital said by telephone: ``Thestudents gathered inside the campus, but when they tried to go intothe streets armed police pushed them back. All the workers wereordered off the campuses and police remained at the gates.''   He said there were conflicting reports about the purpose of thedemonstration.   ``The students were singing. Some people say they had demands topresent to the government. Others say they were supporting lastweek's coup attempt. I am not sure which. I don't speak Amharic,''Ethiopia's official language.   A Western diplomat, also speaking on condtiion of anonymity,said details of the demonstration by a few hundred students weresketchy, but that some carried banners critical of Mengistu.   He said there were reports that police beat students withtruncheons and some injured ones were taken to the hospital.   An Addis Ababa resident told The Associated Press both campuseswere quiet in the afternoon, and Ethiopia's official media had notmentioned the confrontation by 7 p.m.   Last week's coup attempt began Tuesday afternoon, a few hoursafter Mengistu left for a visit to East Germany. It was crushedFriday with the surrender of the 150,000-man 2nd Army in Asmara,capital of northern Eritrea province.   The government has not mentioned casualties and has announcedonly the deaths of three generals: Merid Negussie, chief of staff;Amha Desta, air force commander, and Denissie Bulto, 2nd Armycommander.   Initially, the government said they were killed by soldiersloyal to the government. Mengistu, who hurried home Wednesdaynight, told a weekend rally in Addis Ababa they committed suiciderather than surrender.   Mengistu also indicated the generals were unhappy with thegovernment's conduct of the wars with rebels in Eritrea and inTigre province, and with his Marxist rule.   ``There were often cases when our forces were whistled back whenthey appeared to be on the brink of victory,'' he declared.   Unitersity students demonstrated frequently against EmperorHaile Selassie before Mengistu and fellow officers seized power in1974.</TEXT></DOC>
