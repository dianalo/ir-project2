Takako Doi, a veteran of 20 years in parliament, is chairwomanof the Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition party. She ispressing opposition's case now that the governing LiberalDemocratic Party is mired in scandal.   The former law professor has not directly expressed an ambitionto be prime minister, but she would probably have the first shot ifthe Liberal Democrats fail badly in a general election and theSocialists win more seats than the other smaller parties.   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said April 25 that he will stepdown soon to take responsibility for a loss of public trust becauseof an influence-peddling scandal. His conservative party, in powersince it was formed in 1955, has yet to decide on a successor, andmany party leaders are ruled out because of their links to thescandal.   The Liberal Democrats are expected to put forward asecond-ranking figure as a sort of interim prime minister and tryto regain the public's trust before a general election that wouldgive the Socialists a chance to oust the long-governing party.   ``This is a golden opportunity for opposition parties to takeover the governing power from the hands of the Liberal DemocraticParty,'' Ms. Doi told reporters this week.   ``If we fail to take advantage of this situation, we may as wellremain minority oppositionists eternally.''   The Liberal Democrats have ignored her calls to let theopposition form a minority government in the Diet, or parliament.So the only alternative for the Socialists is to prevent the rulingparty from winning the next election for the lower house, where theLiberal Democrats hold 297 of the 512 seats.   A lower house election must be held by next summer, but beforethen the electorate will vote this summer for half the seats in theupper house, where the Liberal Democrats hold 143 of the 252 seats.   Analysts question whether the opposition has much of a chancegiven its lack of unity. The opposition includes the SocialistParty (85 lower house seats), Buddhist-based Komeito (56 seats),Democratic Socialists (29 seats), Marxist-Leninist Commmunists (27seats) and a scattering of independents.   But analysts agree that it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunityfor Ms. Doi and the Socialists, who haven't tasted power since afew months in the late 1940s.   In 1986, Ms. Doi became the first woman to head a politicalparty in Japan. Her predecessor resigned over the Socialists'election defeat to the popular former Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone.   Ms. Doi is one of only 27 women against 737 men in both houses,and her voice often is heard at public events. She also appears ontelevision shows, not only to debate politics but to take part ingame programs. She is from Kobe, where her father was a doctor.   She is a regular in the parliamentarians' annual singingcontest, performing the Japanese version of ``My Way,'' and sheclaims expertise in pachinko, the equivalent of Western pinballgenerally associated with students and working class people.   Analysts say Ms. Doi, a former professor of law at DoshishaUniversity in Kyoto, helped the Socialists dramatically improvetheir dry image of a blue-collar party heavily dependent on laborunions.   Now the party has a wider range of support from women'sorganizations, most of which had primarily supported theCommunists, as well as from environmental, civil rights and peacegroups.   Among disagreements between opposition parties is defense. TheSocialists call for Japan to become a neutral and unarmed nation byshifting the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty into more of a friendshiptreaty with no military provisions. The two middle-of-the-roadparties, Komeito and Democratic Socialists, insist the securitytreaty is indispensable.</TEXT></DOC>
