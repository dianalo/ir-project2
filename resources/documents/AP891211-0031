REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Corazon Aquino has shownsteely resolve in confronting the armed challenge to her rule. Butit is unclear whether she is ready to move quickly on the manifoldproblems that helped trigger the latest coup attempt.   On Saturday, rebel soldiers gave up the last stronghold theyseized Dec. 1, when thousands of military mutineers rose up againsther in Manila, Cebu City, Legazpi and elsewhere.   But the crisis facing the Aquino government is far from over.More than half the estimated 3,000 rebels who battled governmenttroops in the Manila area remain at large, including key leaderssuch as Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina and renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio``Gringo'' Honasan.   Troops who did not join the revolt issued statements of support.The grave social and political problems the mutineers tried toexploit remain unaddressed.   In one indication of the mood, share prices tumbled on theManila Stock Exchange today in the first day of trading since thecoup attempt was launched. The Manila Composite Stock Index of 25selected issues fell 8 percent.   Throughout the coup attempt, Mrs. Aquino adamantly refused tocompromise with the mutineers, even as rebel planes rocketed theMalacanang presidential palace.   ``I promise you that I will continue to serve the Filipinopeople, and I will offer every moment of my life, and I shall neverlet evil triumph in our country,'' Mrs. Aquino said Sunday duringfuneral services for a loyal officer killed in the struggle.``Those who are guilty will be meted out the full penalties.''   After each of the five previous coup attempts, Mrs. Aquino madethe same bold, belligerent statements. Action proved weaker thanrhetoric.   Few participants were ever punished. Those who were sentenced toprison by military courts remain under house arrest pending reviewof their sentences.   This time, however, the administration may be considering afirmer response.   Last week, Mrs. Aquino declared a national state of emergency.Specific powers made available to the president must be ratified byCongress.   But congressional sources say the House of Representatives andthe Senate are prepared to grant her broad, temporary powers tosuspend strikes, conduct searches and seizures without warrants andtake other measures to restore order and prevent another coup.   The emergency declaration has been widely applauded as anecessary step and welcome sign of firmness, although someprominent human rights advocates expressed concern that it couldinfringe on personal freedoms.   Mrs. Aquino also appears ready to confront civilian oppositionpoliticians long suspected of having prior knowledge of coupattempts, if not having been part of the financing and planning.   During a speech Friday to a crowd of more than 100,000, shesingled out Vice President Salvador Laurel, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrileand her pro-Marcos cousin, Eduardo Cojuangco, for possibleinvolvement in the coup attempt.   But others believe Mrs. Aquino must also come to grips with thefact that her popularity has been declining in the face of risingprices, a breakdown in law and order, infrastructure decay andalleged corruption.   ``The bottom line here is: Can democracy work in the Third Worldcountry?'' wrote former presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno inthe Philippine Daily Star. ``Can it work in the Philippines withone of the highest poverty threshholds ... with a population thathas doubled in 30 years ... So far, it hasn't.''   Those behind the latest coup attempt apparently timed theirattacks in hopes of expoiting public discontent. Most Filipinosoppose a military-backed government but still believe Mrs. Aquinohas been ineffective in coping with the nation's problems.   ``It is time to show righteous anger and steely determination,not only against enemies of the state but also against the sorrystate of the nation,'' wrote columnist Antonio Abaya in The ManilaChronicle.   After coup attempts in November 1986 and August 1987, Mrs.Aquino revamped her Cabinet. Many political commentators believeshe must take the same step this time.   Respected commentator Luis Beltran wrote in The Manila Standardthat some advisers are urging a such change but others feel theshow of support for Mrs. Aquino at Friday's rally indicate changesin the Cabinet are not necessary.   Before the rally, columnist Alvin Capino wrote in the PhilippineDaily Globe that many people wanted to display solidarity with Mrs.Aquino but that a large crowd ``would give President Aquino theimpression that they are happy with her administration.''   Government sources complain bitterly about inefficiency in thepresidential palace staff, where rival factions block directivesthey don't like.   Sources familiar with the palace staff, speaking on condition ofanonymnity, also complain that Mrs. Aquino's advisers have isolatedher from the problems of ordinary Filipinos.</TEXT></DOC>
