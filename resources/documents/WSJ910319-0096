According to Merrill's just-released annual proxystatement, Chairman William A. Schreyer received $1.6 millionin cash compensation, President Daniel P. Tully $1.3 millionand Executive Vice President John L. Steffens $1.1 million.</LP><TEXT>   Jerome P. Kenney, the only other official with disclosedcompensation of more than $1 million in 1989, was paid$875,000 last year, a 20% decline. During the year, Mr.Kenney shifted from president of capital markets to executivevice president for corporate strategy and research.   Merrill's executive-pay levels are closely watched becauseof the firm's size and its continuing efforts to cut costs.However, the 1990 pay levels aren't as sensitive an issueamong Merrill's work force as they were in the prior year. In1989, the four top Merrill officers each made more than $1million despite the brokerage firm's loss of $213.4 millionand a program to shed more than 3,000 jobs.   In 1990 Merrill earned $191.9 million, or $1.59 a share,on slightly lower revenue of $11.2 billion -- results thefirm calls &quot;reasonable given the business environment.&quot; Theresults represent a 5.8% return on equity, far short of itsgoal of at least 15%.   Much of Merrill's annual report focuses on cost-cuttingdrives begun in earnest in late 1989 and continued throughlast year. During 1990, Merrill said, it undertook &quot;more than80 initiatives to divest, reduce or eliminate operations that{had} failed to meet profitability targets.&quot;   Merrill, like other brokerage firms, has been taking stepsto reduce its exposure to risky investments. Its portfolio oftemporary &quot;bridge&quot; loans used to finance takeover deals wasreduced in 1990 to a net carrying value of $100 million from$670 million, it said. Also, Merrill's inventory of high-riskjunk bonds was reduced nearly 50%, to $395 million, the firmsaid.   Merrill said a &quot;difficult operating environment&quot; prevailedon Wall Street last year. It cited &quot;two near-term problems --the onset of recession and the crisis in the Middle East,&quot; aswell as the longer-term problems of &quot;severe overcapacity inthe securities industry and intensified competitionworld-wide, resulting in reduced profit margins in many keybusinesses.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
