Is ethics ingovernment a big problem or a big yawn?   Whether the issue is a third-rate political burglary or EdMeese's unreported holdings or Ollie North's lies to Congressor Jim Wright's investments or political action committeesgenerally, an influential group of conservatives and businesscommentators -- including this newspaper's editorialists --constitute an amen corner chanting, &quot;So what]&quot; Theyperenially dismiss ethics criticism as mere partisanpolitics. The reason for the criticism of an Ed Meese or aJohn Sununu, they claim, is not that he was feathering hisnest, but that he was a Reaganite. The implied premise is&quot;laissez faire&quot; in government as well as in business; thelaws of the marketplace elevated over ethics laws.</LP><TEXT>   The Journal has defended Martin Luther King, Ted Kennedyand retiring Democratic congressional whip Bill Gray fromethics cops as a non-partisan way to disparage ethicspolicing in general -- although in the case of Bill Gray,raising the speculation that he left Congress because of anunknown probe into his honoraria merrily contributed to thevery ethics obsession the Journal denounces.   But the ethics-shmethics school has it backward. It's notthat Mr. Sununu and the other prominent Republicans caught inscandals have been accused because they were Reaganites;rather, it appears that Reaganites -- contemptuous of thefederal government, accustomed to private-sector privileges,impatient with regulatory restrictions -- have a tendency tobe caught in scandals. Of course Democrats are not immune totemptation either, as the Abscam and Keating Five casesdemonstrate.   Ideological apologists should heed Thomas Jefferson'sinsight: Don't ask if someone is a Republican or aFederalist; ask, is he honest, does he believe in theConstitution? Public officials make decisions that governtrillions of dollars and millions of citizens. They affectthe quality of our lives and our democracy. If they makethose decisions for reasons of self-interest or the economicwell-being of their pals, the rule of law becomes merely atotem. The air is fouled. Children go hungry. Crime pays.Fewer people vote, as corruption breeds cynicism and cynicismspawns apathy.   Which is not to deny at times, especially in the summernews doldrums, relatively minor pecadillos get overblown.What is needed are better criteria to help distinguishbetween corruption and indiscretion, between what should bein headlines and what should be in footnotes.   First is the difference between private morality andpublic ethics. Excessive drinking at 9 p.m. at home or even 6p.m. in the office is undesirable, but only if a senator isstumbling around on the Senate floor is it a scandal.Womanizing, too, is undesirable, but it alone shouldn'tdisqualify anyone from public life, unless one believes thatRichard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were better presidents thanFDR and Ike. Alcoholism and adultery are sins but not crimes.Misuse of public funds or office, however, does deserveheadlines.   Consider the current difficulties of Sens. Chuck Robb (D.,Va.) and Al D'Amato (R., N.Y.), both of whom were thesubjects of scathing exposes on national television lastmonth. On NBC's &quot;Expose,&quot; Mr. Robb was said to have had aone-night stand with a beauty queen. He denies it. But evenif true, this private dereliction would be much less seriousthan Mr. D'Amato's alleged misuse -- as discussed on &quot;60Minutes&quot; and &quot;Prime Time Live&quot; -- of HUD funds for politicalgain or the charge that he was a one-man WPA for his donors,cronies and family.   If the press and public fixate on Robb-like allegations,then we incite journalistic vice patrols to peek into privatelives. That can have the effect only of driving talentedcitizens out of public life. But no one should exonerate ortolerate those who treat the public fisc as their ownaccounts payable. John Sununu unrepentantly defended hislimousine ride at public expense to buy antique stamps byarguing that he made work calls en route -- a defense thatwould exonerate taking taxpayer-funded stretch limousineswith phones to a racetrack or a brothel. This seems worsethan anything Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.) ever did in theprivacy of his home.   And the public seems to be accepting this distinction. AMay Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that while only15% thought the media went &quot;too far&quot; in airing the chargesagainst Mr. D'Amato, 61% and 41% thought the media went &quot;toofar&quot; when it came to, respectively, Sen. Kennedy in PalmBeach and Sen. Robb.   Second, we should not be concerned only with honoraria,stock holdings and limousine rides, but also with what ismost ethically rotten in politics: big contributions withstrings attached. No candid member of Congress would denyfeeling soiled by having to beg for help from donors and thenvote on matters affecting those donors. Since no one likes tobite the hand that feeds him, the present campaign financesystem has created a national legislature made up of rationalpeople who care more about their contributors than theirconstituents.   We're getting a pay-per-view Congress, an increasinglyprivatized place that responds to those who have anted up.Until this country has a public financing system for Congressas clean as the one for electing presidents, there will bemore Keating Fives -- and members who don't understand whyaccepting vacations for favors is criminal (e.g., MarioBiaggi) but accepting contributions for favors is customary(e.g., Al D'Amato). With contributors constantly seeking morelegislative help from Congress, and the members of Congressconstantly seeking more financial help from theircontributors, America's ethics scandal can only widen andworsen.   The country must hold the guardians of the public weal toa higher standard than innocent unless convicted -- the Meesedefense. While jaded pundits are quick to dismiss financialfavors and contributions to policy makers as merely theappearance of impropriety, the rest of the country mustrecognize them for what they are: conflicts of interest. AJohn Sununu is so powerful that it is not necessary to provethat a private benefit did influence him for that benefit tobe illegitimate; all that's necessary to condemn that benefitis that it be plausible that it might influence him.   The problem with ethics is not that we care too much, butthat we don't care enough. I write this just before I have tofill out my second ethics disclosure form of the month. It'sa pain, yet a very acceptable price to pay to increase theprobability -- not guarantee, just increase the probability-- that those who spend a third of the nation's income willdo it honorably and effectively. The alternative is tosurrender to the view of the South American official whocandidly declared: &quot;To my enemies, the law; to my friends,facilities.&quot;   ---   Mr. Green, author of &quot;Who Runs Congress&quot; (Dell, 1984), isNew York City's commissioner of consumer affairs. His 1989formal complaint prompted the Senate Ethics Committee tolaunch its investigation of Sen. Al D'Amato.</TEXT></DOC>
