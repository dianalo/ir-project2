(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Environmentalists lost a major courtbattle over the rare northern spotted owl Thursday when a federaljudge lifted a ban on logging vast tracts of old-growth forestsadministered by the U.S. government.   U.S. District Judge Helen Frye granted a summary judgmentThursday in favor of the Bureau of Land Management and lifted apreliminary injunction that had prohibited the logging ofold-growth forests within 2.1 miles of spotted owl habitats.   Pending any further appeals by the environmentalists, the BLMsaid, the ruling clears the way for sale of 337 million board feetof old-growth timber in western Oregon that has been tied up inlegal challenges since last summer.   The lawsuit was filed against the federal agency by the PortlandAudubon Society and other environmental groups. They had contendedthe BLM's timber management plans failed to adequately protectold-growth forests, where the rare northern spotted owl lives andhunts.   The owl has been proposed for listing as a threatened species bythe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.   Andy Kerr, conservation director for one of the plaintiffs, theOregon Natural Resources Council, said his group was disappointedbut not surprised by the decision and added that the case likelywould be appealed.   ``If this ruling stands, it would only serve to make the listingof the northern spotted owl under the Engangered Species Act allthe more compelling,'' Kerr said.   Frye ruled that the environmental groups' request was too broadand that appeals would have to be made on a case-by-case basis.   In a 73-page opinion, she ruled that the Audubon Society'schallenge ``does not seek judicial review of an activity of the BLMbased on site-specific new information, such as the discovery of abald eagle nest or an archeological `find' or a blow down of timberon a particular sale location.   ``The Portland Audubon Society's challenge cannot reasonably becharacterized as a challenge to a `particular activity' for whichjudicial review is available,'' the judge wrote.   ``They can't challenge our management plans, they have tochallenge individual sales,'' said BLM spokesman Ed Ciliberti.   Despite her ruling, however, the judge was severely critical ofthe BLM's failure to alter its management plans to take intoaccount new information.   She said the agency's action ``was arbitrary and capricious inlight of the new, significant, and probably accurate informationthat the planned logging of spotted owl habitat raises uncertaintyabout the ability of the spotted owl to survive as a species.''   Ciliberti said the BLM would prepare a detailed summary judgmentfor Frye's approval, then would determine what step to take next.   ``I think frankly we're pleased that she's ruled the way shehas,'' he said, ``but I think a substantial statement will have towait until our lawyers review the opinion.''   He said the agency wouldn't be able to proceed with timber salesin old-growth timber until Frye signs the judgment, and he notedthe environmental groups could appeal.   ``We do have some sales that are on the shelf that have beenfully prepared that we might be able to put forth fairly quickly,''Ciliberti said.   Frye had dismissed the lawsuit in April 1988. But, last June,the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an injunction forbiddingnew timber sales within 2.1 miles of spotted owl nests on BLM landin Western Oregon.   The injunction held up despite repeated challenges by the timberindustry. As a result, the BLM had to cut its planned timberofferings for the year by one third.   The appeals court returned the case to Frye, who issued apreliminary injunction Feb. 9 reaffirming the logging ban.</TEXT></DOC>
