Administration aides say they are beginning to plan speeches and policy statements to increase pressure on Democrats in Congress to continue the aid, which could be cut off at the end of November under a White House-congressional agreement reached last March.    In addition, officials are considering declassifying and releasing Central Intelligence Agency documents buttressing the administration's contention that Nicaragua's Sandinista government has been receiving an increasing supply of military equipment from Cuba and Soviet bloc nations.    The first round in the new campaign was a little-noticed speech given by Vice President Dan Quayle on Aug. 21 to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. That speech, which was worked on by high-level White House and State Department aides, argued that until Contra rebels can enjoy &quot;safe and democratic conditions&quot; in Nicaragua, &quot;it will remain a moral obligation of the United States to continue its humanitarian assistance.&quot;    White House aides were disappointed, though, that the speech didn't attract more attention and that it wasn't followed up by similar statements from other top officials. The administration intends to begin following up after Labor Day, officials say.    Under their March accord, President Bush and congressional leaders agreed to keep aid flowing to the Contras at a rate of about $4.5 million a month until the February elections, provided the administration supported regional peace plans. But in a side letter to Congress, the administration pledged that it wouldn't send any aid after Nov. 30 unless the chairmen of four congressional committees overseeing appropriations and foreign relations submitted letters approving further assistance. All the chairmen are Democrats, and Democratic lawmakers saw the plan as a way to ensure administration support for peace efforts.    Congress's interest in continuing aid past November was thrown into doubt in early August, when leaders of five Central American nations signed a peace plan calling for voluntary demobilization of the Contras, who operate from base camps in Honduras. House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) has said in recent days that humanitarian aid should continue until the elections despite the new peace plan. But other Democrats haven't decided whether the U.S. should continue aid that will help keep Contra fighters in the field.    The administration appears to have acquired an important ally, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, in its campaign to continue aid. Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.) has just returned from a Latin American trip and said this week that President Arias told him that American humanitarian aid for the Contras should continue through the Nicaraguan elections &quot;and perhaps after that.&quot;    Mr. Arias has been the driving force behind the Central American peace process. His opinion has been particularly influential with congressional Democrats.    U.S. and Central American officials estimate there are 60,000 to 70,000 Contra fighters and their family members in rebel camps along the Nicaraguan-Honduran border. Though the recent Central American peace plan calls for procedures to allow these rebels to safely return to Nicaragua and to participate openly in the political process, Mr. Quayle argued in his speech that &quot;safe and democratic conditions do not exist in Nicaragua today.&quot;    Besides Mr. Quayle, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, deputy national security adviser Robert Gates and deputy secretary of state Lawrence Eagleburger worked on the vice president's speech. Officials said that, in addition to re-emphasizing the themes from that address, the administration plans to try to focus attention on steps the administration thinks Nicaragua's Sandinista leaders are taking to rig the elections to ensure that they win. </TEXT></DOC>
