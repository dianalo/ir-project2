The availability of this exemption is subject ot the express conditionthat the material facts and representations contained in the applicationare true and complete, and that the application accurately describes allmaterial terms of the transactions which are the subject of this exemption.Summary of Facts and Representations  1. The Trust Company is a California trust company formed as a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of CBCG. An application for authorization to form the TrustCompany was approved by the California State Banking Department on August5, 1980. A letter supplementing the original application was filed on May11, 1982, reflecting certain changes which have occurred since that applicationwas approved, e.g., the acquisition of CBCG's parent company, Coldwell,Banker andamp; Company (CB), by Sears, Roebuck and Co. (Sears). That supplementalapplication has been reviewed and approved by the California State BankingDepartment. The Trust Company's activities will be governed by the rulesand regulations of California law which control the activities of trustcompanies and will be subject ot the supervision of the California Superintendentof Banks, including on-site audits and quarterly reporting.  The principal activity of the Trust Company will be to provide trust andreal estate investment management services for tax exempt institutionswishing to invest in real estate. It is contemplated that, for the mostpart, its clientele will be comprised of employee benefit plans sponsoredby corporations, labor unions and governmental agencies. In all cases theinstitutional investor will enter into an agreement (the Trust Agreement)pursuant to which the Trust Company will become trustee with respect toinvested assets. The Trust Agreements for Common Trust Accounts will providethat assets contributed thereto will be commingled with the assets of otherCommon Trust Accounts in one of a series of closed-end collective trusts(Common Trusts) for the purpose of making investments in real estate.\1\<NOTE/> As an alternative to participating in a Common Trust, a planmay elect to establish a Managed Trust Account which will invest in realestate separately. In all cases, the Trust Company will have the responsibilityfor investing any contributions either separately in the case of the ManagedTrust Accounts or collectively, through the Common Trust, and for the managementand disposition of the properties it acquires as trustee. The applicantrepresents that the Trust Company is expected to be a qualifed professionalasset manager (QPAM) as that term is defined in Prohibited TransactionExemption 84-14 (PTE 84-14,49 FR 9494, March 13, 1984).\2\<NOTE/> Therefore, the applicant's request for exemption involvesthose transactions which may not be covered by PTE 84-14 or other relevantstatutory exemptions under section 408 of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The term Common Trust as used herein includes common trustfunds exempt from tax under section 584 of the Code and group trusts, asdefined in Rev. Rul. 81-100, 1981-1 C.B. 326. In the case of a group trust,Common Trust Accounts will not actually be separate trusts formed for purposesof participating in the collective investment trust. Rather, the ParticipatingPlans will invest directly in the group trust via agreements to participate.Such agreements to participate are included within the term Common TrustAccount. The applicant represents that a plan's investment in a CommonTrust will be exempt from the restrictions of section 406(a) of the Actby reason of section 408(b)(8). The Department expresses no opinion hereinwhether all of the conditions of section 408(b)(8) will be satisfied insuch transactions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The applicant represents that, in order to comply withthe conditions of PTE 84-14, Parts II and III, in cases where a CommonTrust or Managed Trust Account using a CB affiliated broker leases propertyto the Trust Company, an employer with respect to an investing plan oran affiliate, of either, the Trust Company will pay the broker's commission,credit that amount to the Trust Account, and reduce the monthly ManagementFee by that amount. The Department expresses no opinion as to whether thisarrangement complies with the relevant conditions of the PTE 84-14, PartsII and III.CBCG was incorporated in 1972 to take over the function of providing fullyintegrated commercial real estate services for CB's clients and to managethe real estate assets of institutional partnerships formed by it. CBCGprovides a broad range of services related to commercial real estate. Ithas been involved in negotiating the sale and lease of virtually everytype of real property, including industrial, commercial, office buildingand apartment complexes. CBCG is also involved directly in property management,capital management, real estate investment advisory services, real estateappraisal, real estate consultation, market research, and other real estaterelated services.CB is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sears and operates as the successorto a real estate brokerage business established in 1906. Prior to its acquisitionby Sears on December 31, 1981, CB was, and continues to be, the largestdiversified real estate service organization in the United States, withoperating offices throughout the country.Since being acquired by Sears, the activities of CB and its affiliateshave been designated a part of the Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group (CBReal Estate Group). The CB Real Estate Group in turn has three major groupsin its organizational structure: (1) Coldwell Banker Residential Group,providing residential brokerage and other services; (2) Homart DevelopmentCo., involved in commercial real estate development; and (3) CBCG, providingbrokerage and other services for all types of commercial real estate.2. The applicant represents that Participating Plans establish either CommonTrust Accounts or Managed Trust Accounts (collectively, Trust Accounts)which will invest in real estate, either by pooling assets through themechanism of a Common Trust or separately in the case of Managed TrustAccounts. No plan may invest in a Trust Account unless it has at least$50,000,000 in assets, and no plan may invest more than 5% of its assetsin any one Trust Account, nor more than 10% of its assets in Trust Accountsmaintained by the Trust Company or an affiliate. The Common Trusts andManaged Trust Accounts will be designed either as ``blind'' accounts wherethe plans invest and the Trust Company then selects real estate investments,or as ``specified property'' accounts where the Trust Company identifiesa particular property or properties for investment and the plan(s) theninvest in the specified account. The Trust Accounts will be establishedpursuant to a Trust Agreement. Under the terms of the Trust Agreements,the Trust Company will have complete responsibility, with certain exceptionsdiscussed in paragraph 7 below, for, <T3>inter alia, </T3>searching for investments, making investment decisionsand for the management and disposition of the properties it acquires astrustee, although a plan establishing a Managed Trust Account may, if itchooses to do so, provide guidelines to be followed by the Trust Companyin investing and managing assets in that Managed Trust Account.3. The decision to participate in a Trust Account and the determinationof the amount to be placed therein will be made by a fiduciary of the planwho is independent of and unrelated to CBCG or any of its affiliates.\3\<NOTE/> The decision to invest in a Trust Account will be based uponknowledge of the terms and conditions established in the Trust Agreementand disclosed in a prospectus, and of the conditions imposed by this exemption.The investment objectives of each Common Trust and Managed Trust Accountwill be to obtain operating income and capital appreciation, primarilythrough the purchase of equity interests in or the development of income-producingreal property. Investments will consist principally of fee interests, leaseholds,joint venture participations and mortgage loans convertible into any ofthe forgoing interests in real estate. The Trust Company represents that,due to the illiquid nature of most real estate investments and the closedend nature of the Common Trusts, Participating Plans generally will notbe able to redeem their interests in a Common Trust prior to the terminationand dissolution of the Common Trust.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The applicant has represented that CBCG or its affiliatesmay act as a fiduciary or a service provider to plans which may investin a Trust Account. However, the applicant has also represented that neitherCBCG nor any affiliate will use the authority, discretion or influencewhich makes CBCG or such affiliate a fiduciary with respect to such planto cause the plan to invest in a Trust Account.<ITAG tagnum="28">The Department notes that, to the extent that CBCG or an affiliateis deemed to be a fiduciary by virtue of rendering investment advice asdescribed in regulation 29 CFR 2510.3-21(c)(ii)(B), the presence of anunrelated second fiduciary acting on the investment adviser's recommendationson behalf of the plan is not sufficient to insulate the investment adviserfrom fiduciary liability under section 406(b) of the Act. (See AdvisoryOpinions 84-03A and 84-04A, issued by the Department on January 4, 1984.)In this regard, the Department has determined that it is unable to makethe findings necessary under section 408(a) of the Act with respect totransactions which involve the provision of investment advice by CBCG orits affiliates. Accordingly, the Department has limited relief for investmentsin Managed Trust Accounts to section 406(a) of the Act.</ITAG>4. The Trust Company expects that Trust Accounts ordinarily will be fullyinvested in real estate within 12 to 18 months of their inception dependingon the type of properties sought, the market for such properties at thetme, any geographic or size requirements and other variables. Pending theinvestment in real estate, the Trust Company will invest cash contributedto the Trust Account in: obligations of the United States or its agencies;repurchase agreements with respect to such obligations; certificates ofdeposit or deposits in interest bearing accounts of banks insured by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation; money market funds having assetsof over $100 million; commercial paper rated A1 or better; and bankers'acceptances of banks having assets in excess of $1 billion.5. Any income from the operation or proceeds from the sale or refinancingof assets of the Common Trust or Managed Trust Account and any contributionsby the Participating Plan(s) to the Common Trust or Managed Trust Accountin excess of the amount required for initial investment will be distributedto such Plan(s) to the extent that such amounts are not needed for Trustpurposes. For example, certain sums will be used to maintain reasonablereserves established by the Trust Company in connection with the Trustassets (including, without limitation, reserves for repayment of existingor anticipated obligations or for contingent liabilities). Such distributionsshall be made to the Participating Plan within a reasonable time afterthe completion of the annual audit for that fiscal year, but in no eventlater than ninety (90) days after the close of such fiscal year. Subjectto the dissolution and termination provisions of the Trust Agreement (describedin paragraphs 9 and 10), the Trust Company expects that the Trust Accountswill generally hold their real property investments for a period of notless than ten years. However, there is no restriction upon the length oftime that real property investments of the Common Trusts and Managed TrustAccounts may be held. The Trust Company, in its sole discretion, may sellor refinance any or all investments at any time if it believes such actionwould be in the best interest of the Managed Trust Account or the CommonTrust.The income from investments and the net cash proceeds from any sale orother disposition or refinancing of real property, less the operating reservesnoted above, will not be reinvested in real estate but will be distributedto the Plan(s) participating in the Managed Trust Accounts of Common Trusts.The Managed Trust Accounts and Common Trusts, therefore, are intended tobe self-liquidating in nature. Such distributions to Participating Planswill be treated as return of capital and taken into account when the DispositionFee (described below) is calculated.6. The applicant represents that Participating Plans will be charged aone-time Subscription Fee (generally 1-2% of invested assets) at the tmethey make their investment in a Trust Account to defray the expenses oforganizing the Trust Account, identifying suitable investments, and completingthe initial purchases of investment properties for the Trust Account. Inaddition, the Trust Company will be paid a monthly Management Fee, expectedto range from 0.1667-0.2083% per month (or 2-2.5% annually) of the netasset value of the Trust Account. The value of assets for the purpose ofdetermining the Management Fee will be based upon independent appraisalsby licensed appraisers who are not employees or affiliates of the TrustCompany or an affiliate. The Management Fee will compensate the Trust Companyfor its investment management and Management Services, including propertymanagement, real estate brokerage and related services.\4\<NOTE/> The Trust Company will employ Coldwell Banker Capital ManagementServices, Inc. (CBCMS) a subsidiary of CBCG and an affiliate of the TrustCompany to provide such Management Services. CBCMS is a registered investmentadvisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the applicant representsthat CBCMS will also be a QPAM. CBCMS will utilize the services of others,including other CBCG divisions and subsidiaries as required, at no additionalcost to the Trust Accounts. The Trust Company will also have the responsibilityto provide or arrange for all other support services performed by non-CBCGaffiliates necessary to the operation of the investment of the Common Trustsand Managed Trust Account.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The applicant represents that the provision of investmentmanagement and Management Services by CBCG or its affiliates and the receiptof fees thereby is exempt from the prohibitions of section 406(a) of theAct by reason of section 408(b)(2). The Department expresses no opinionas to whether the relevant conditions of section 408(b)(2) are compliedwith in the above arrangement. The Department notes, however, that to theextent that a Participating Plan's investment in a Trust Account does notmeet the conditions of section 408(b)(8) of ERISA or Part I of this proposedexemption, the relief afforded by section 408(b)(2) of ERISA may not beavailable.Once all the investment properties of a Trust Account have been sold andthe proceeds of the sale have been distributed or are available for distributionthe Trust Company may be paid a Disposition Fee in accordance with theterms of the Trust Agreement. (A Disposition Fee may also be paid on thebasis of a constructive sale pursuant to the trustee removal and resignationprovisions of the Trust Agreement discussed in paragraph 9 below.) A DispositionFee will be payable only after the Participating Plans have received, throughdistributions from the Trust Account, a return of all the capital investedin the Trust Account by the Participating Plans and an annual rate of returnon that capital which will be specified in advance for each Trust Accountbefore any investments are made by any Participating Plan. The DispositionFee will be a pre-determined fixed percentage of the excess of the dispositionproceeds over the amount necessary to provide the return of capital andpre-established rate of return to the Participating Plans.The applicant represents that the fee structure, including the DispositionFee, is in the interest of the Participating Plans because it providesan added inducement for the Trust Company to take the actions necessaryto maximize the return to the Participating Plans. In addition, the ParticipatingPlans will receive their return of capital and the pre-established rateof return before a Disposition Fee will be payable.7. The applicant represents that with certain types of investment activity,it is very difficult to estimate leasing brokerage fees. Accordingly, whensuch investment activity is to be the principal activity of a Managed TrustAccount, Participating Plans may want to retain control over leasing brokeragedecisions to avoid the uncertainty in the fee estimation process. In orderto accommodate this interest, some Managed Trust Accounts may be structuredso that the Participating Plans maintain complete control over all leasingbrokerage decisions including the selection of leasing brokers and paymentof leasing brokerage fees. As a result, the Trust Company would not exerciseany fiduciary authority in the leasing brokerage area. Rather, independentfiduciaries for the Participating Plans will select the leasing brokers,and negotiate and approve all leasing brokerage fees. Such leasing brokeragefees will be charged back directly to the Managed Trust Account.\5\<NOTE/> The applicant represents that the Management Fee chargedManaged Trust Accounts for real estate related services will be reducedin these circumstances to reflect the reduced responsibilities of the TrustCompany.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ It is represented that in such situations, the possiblepayment of brokerage commissions to CBCG affiliates will be exempt fromthe prohibitions of section 406(a) of the Act by the statutory exemptionprovided by section 408(b)(2). The Department expresses no opinion hereinwhether all of the conditions of section 408(b)(2) of the Act will be satisfiedin such transactions. In addition, the Department notes that the exemptionfor party in interest transactions with such plans contained in PTE 84-14will be unavailable, because the Trust Company, as QPAM, will not be negotiatingthe terms of the transactions on behalf of the Managed Trust Accounts.8. Services which are necessary and customary in the operation of realestate investments, and not included in Management Services, will be providedexclusively by independnt service providers who will be compensated bythe Trust Accounts. Such services include, but are not limited to: legalservices; services of architects, designers, engineers, etc.; insurancebrokerage and consultation; auditing and accounting; appraisals and mortgagebrokerage; and development of income-producing real property. The feescharged to the Trust Accounts by the independent service providers willbe commesurate with the fees charged by the service provider on a regularbasis for comparable work in the respective locale.9. Under the Trust Agreement for a Managed Trust Account, the Trust Companymay be removed as trustee, at any time, without cause, by the ParticipatingPlan establishing such Managed Trust Account through the delivery of anotice of removal to the Trust Company. The Trust Company may resign astrustee, at any time after the Managed Trust Account has been in existencefor ten years, without cause, by written notice to the Plan. Such removalor resignation will generally be effective upon the acceptance of appointmentby a successor trustee appointed by the Plan.The Trust Company may be removed as trustee under a Common Trust at anytime upon an affirmative vote or written consent of Participating Planswhich have contributed 50% or more of the capital in the Common Trust.The Trust Agreement will provide that any holders of 10% or more of theinterests in the Common Trust can direct the Trust Company to call a meetingof the investors to consider such removal. The Trust Company may resign,without cause, at any time after the tenth anniversary of the creationof the Common Trust, by written notice to the Participating Plans. Suchremoval or resignation will generally be effective upon the acceptanceof appointment by a successor trustee appointed by Participating Planswhich have contributed 50% or more of the capital in the Common Trust.In the case of either a Common Trust or Managed Trust Account, when theTrust Company is removed or resigns as trustee, the Trust Company willbe entitled to the Disposition Fee based on a constructive sale of theTrust Account's assets, calculated as the Disposition Fee would be in theevent of the actual sale of all of the Trust Account's assets. The valueof the Trust Account's assets for the purpose of a constructive sale willbe established by an MAI licensed real estate appraiser, independent ofCBCG and its affiliates and approved by the Participating Plan establishingthe Managed Trust Account or Participating Plans which have contributed50 percent or more of the capital to the Common Trust. The valuation tobe used for the purpose of calcualting whether a ``constructive sale''Disposition Fee is owed, and how much, will be the lower of the appraisalor the most recent annual valuation prepared by the Trust Company for theTrust Account's assets.10. A Managed Trust Account may be dissolved and terminated at any timeby the Participating Plan upon ninety (90) days written notice to the TrustCompany. The events which will cause dissolution and termination of a CommonTrust are: (1) The decision of participants holding more than fifty percent(50%) of all interests in the Common Trust; (2) the decision of the TrustCompany, after the Common Trust has been in existence for 15 years; and(3) failure to select a successor trustee within sixty (60) days followingthe removal or resignation of the Trust Company as trustee.11. Each plan participating in a Common Trust or Managed Trust Accountwill receive:(a) Audited Financial Statements prepared by independent public accountantsselected by the Trust Company not later than ninety (90) days after theend of the Common Trust or Managed Trust Account fiscal year.(b) Quarterly reports prepared by the Trust Company relating to the overallfinancial position and operating results of the Common Trust or ManagedTrust Account and, in the case of Common Trusts, the balance of each participant'sTrust interest. In addition, the reports will include a full disclosureof all fees paid by the Common Trust or Managed Trust Account, and by anypartnerships or joint ventures in which it has invested.(c) Annual estimates of the current fair market value of all propertiesowned by the Common Trust or Managed Trust Account.(d) In the case of a Common Trust, a list of the investors in that CommonTrust.In addition, the plan or plans participating in a Managed Trust Accountor Common Trust, the sponsor or sponsors of such plan or plans, the participantsand beneficiaries of such plan or plans and duly authorized representativesof any of the above will have access during normal business hours to allrecords of the Trust Company relevant to Trust Accounts in which they havean interest.

(Airways)of a portion of a leasehold estate (the Leasehold) in the ``Worldport''airline passenger terminal (the Terminal) and the land (the Land) underlyingthe Terminal located at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK); (2)the proposed contribution in kind to the Plans by Airways of the remainingvalue of the Leasehold following reduction for that portion of the Leaseholdsold to the Plans by Airways; and (3) the proposed sublease (the Sublease)of the Terminal by the Plans to Airways for the duration of the remainingterm of the Leasehold at a fixed monthly rental rate; provided that theterms of the transactions are not less favorable to the Plans than thosenegotiated at arm's length in similar circumstances between unrelated thirdparties, and an independent fiduciary, among other things, reviews, monitors,and approves the proposed transactions.Summary of Facts and Representations1. Airways, the sponsor of the Plans, is a New York corporation organizedin 1927 and headquartered at 200 Park Avenue, New York, New York. Airwaysis an international airline serving approximately 28 cities in the U.S.and 68 destinations in Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, Africa,and the Middle East. Airways is one of two principal subsidiaries of PanAmerican Corporation (Pan Am), a Delaware holding company. The other subsidiary,Pan Am World Services, Inc. (World Services), provides management and technicalservices on a contract basis to governments and private entities aroundthe world.In addition to World Services and Airways, Pan Am owns two other airlinesubsidiaries, Pan Am Express, Inc. (Pan Am Express) and the Pan Am Shuttle.Pan Am Express services 12 cities in the U.S. and Canada and 10 citiesin Europe, providing connecting traffic to Airways' long-haul internationaloperations. The Pan Am Shuttle provides hourly service in the New York-Bostonand New York-Washington DC markets.2. All of the Plans involved in the proposed transactions are tax-qualifieddefined benefit pension plans, and all are subject to Title IV of the Act.The named fiduciary for the Plans, within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)of the Act, is a pension committee (the Committee) established by Airwayswhich is responsible for establishing investment guidelines for the investmentand reinvestment of assets of the Plans, other than the Leasehold, andfor monitoring the investment performance of Bear Stearns Fiduciary Services,Inc. (Fiduciary Services), which is acting as the independent fiduciaryon behalf of the Plans for the proposed transactions.As of January 1, 1987, the Plans had a total of 40,200 participants ofwhich 17,637 are active and 22,563 are inactive, retired, or terminatedvested participants. As of January 1, 1987, the three largest Plans werethe Cooperative Plan, the Clerical Plan, and the Mechanical Stores Plan.Collectively, the Plans have assets, as of January 1, 1987, totalling approximately$475.3 million, excluding any unpaid contributions due to the Plans. TheCooperative Plan is the largest with assets amounting to $345.3 million.The Flight Engineers Plan, the Mechanical Stores Plan, the Non-ContractPlan, and the Clerical Plan have assets of $68.8 million, $26.2 million,$21.7 million, and $13.4 million, respectively, as of January 1, 1987.The total unfunded liability for the Plans at the end of 1986 was approximately$621.3 million. Benefit accruals under all of the Plans were frozen asof December 31, 1983, as a condition of certain funding waivers grantedby the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The applicant represents that the information providedis the most current available.IRS has granted Airways conditional waivers of the minimum funding requirementsof the Plans for plan years 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1986. With respectto the Plans, the waivers for 1980, 1981 and 1982 entitled Airways to deferand fund over fifteen years a total of $146.2 million. The conditionalwaiver for the year 1983 in the amount of $35.6 million with respect tothe Plans required early payment in lieu of a fifteen-year amortizationprogram. Part of such amount was repaid in 1985, and the remaining portionwas paid in the first quarter of 1986. The conditional waiver for the 1986plan year amounts to $48.2 million, plus interest for a total of approximately$51.1 million.Under the terms of the 1986 waiver which was conditionally granted by IRSon September 15, 1987, Airways could by March 15, 1988, either: (1) Obtaina prohibited transaction exemption from the Department which permittedthe assignment of the Leasehold and the contribution in kind of the valueof Airways' Leasehold interest to the Plans; or (2) make certain cash paymentsto the Plans. The waiver was conditioned on airways' pledging stock inWorld Services as collateral for amounts due under the minimum fundingrequirements. Subsequently, the IRS granted extensions to the 1986 waiveron the condition that certain cash payments were made to an escrow accounton behalf of the Plans.Most recently, the IRS by letter dated September 14, 1988, further modifiedthe 1986 waiver by extending the deadline to January 15, 1989, and by reopeningthe 1983 waiver in the amount of $29.5 million. In connection with thereopening of the 1983 waiver, Airways agreed to restore, in full, the creditbalance in the funding standard account by making periodic installmentpayments to the Plans of $4 million by October 15, 1988, $6 million byNovember 15, 1988, $9 million by December 15, 1988, and $10.5 million byJanuary 15, 1989. Further, because the Leasehold had not been contributedto the Plans by September 15, 1988, Airways was obligated on that dateto make a cash payment to the Plans totalling approximately $36 million,which included the amount previously held in the escrow account. It isrepresented that this $36 million dollar payment, together with the aggregatecredit of approximately $29.5 resulting from the reopening of the 1983funding waiver, and the extension of the 1986 conditional funding waiveramount, enabled Airways to satisfy in full its funding requirement underSection 412 of the Code for the 1987 plan year which was due on September15, 1988.As a condition of the 1986 funding waiver, Pan Am pledged for the benefitof the Plans the outstanding capital stock of World Services as collateralsatisfactory to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC) tosecure the funding amount waived in 1986 and to secure a portion of previouslywaived contributions up to a maximum of $75 million. Subsequently, in reopeningthe 1983 funding waiver on September 14, 1988, in the amount of $29.5 million,the IRS required an additional security interest in the World Servicesstock be pledged in that amount, and increased the total security interestin favor of the Plans to $104.5 million. Under the terms of the pledge,the additional security interest in the amount of $29.5 million is to bereleased <T3>pro rata </T3>as installment payments are made to the Plans from October,1988 through January, 1989. In addition, the Plans' original $75 millionsecurity interest in the stock of World Services is to be released, ifeither: (1) The Department grants an exemption for the subject transactions,or (2) Airways contributes an additional $60 million to the Plan on January15, 1989.3. Airways' principal base of operations is located at JFK in New York,where it operates ground facilities, including a major maintenance buildingand the Terminal. The Terminal in its present configuration provides 16jet gates, plus a heliport, commuter aircraft, and plane-mate facilitiesfor up to 26 aircraft. It is represented that there are 713,568 squarefeet of rental space in the Terminal, 102,432 square feet in roadways,and 49.38 acres of ground surrounding the Terminal. The Terminal also providesfacilities to various concessionaires, restaurants, and other businesseswhich operate within the building. It is represented that the Terminalis unique in that it is the only major airport facility that permits internationalconnections within a single building and which has its own U.S. Customsinspection area. The Terminal was constructed by Airways during 1957-1960 at an historicalcost of $20 million, substantially enlarged during the period 1970-1972at a cost of $120 million, and updated in 1980-1984 for $40 million. Airwaysprovided the equity funding for the Terminal construction and improvementsunder agreements with the City of New York (the City), and with the PortAuthority of New York and New Jersey, formerly called the Port of New YorkAuthority (the Port Authority), a corporate and politic body establishedby compact between the states of New York and New Jersey. The City retainstitle to the Terminal and the ownership of the Land underlying the Terminalbut leases this Land to the Port Authority under a lease that expires atthe end of 2015. The Port Authority in turn leases the Land to Airwayson an exclusive long-term basis, pursuant to a lease (the Lease) whichestablished the Leasehold estate for Airways in the Land and the Terminal.4. The Lease was originally entered January 1, 1970, between Airways andthe Port Authority. It is represented that the terms of the Lease and anyamendments thereto were negotiated at arm's length between Airways andthe Port Authority. The Port Authority's Lease with Airways stipulatesa non-escalating rent of $1.68 million per year and expires in 1998. Underthe provisions of the Lease, the Leasehold may not be assigned nor theTerminal sublet to another party without the Port Authority's consent andapproval.5. Airways proposes: (1) To sell to the Plans a portion of its Leaseholdinterest in the Land and the Terminal for a sales price which equals the$36 millon transferred by Airways to the Plans after September 14, 1988,and any additional contributions made to the Plans through the date onwhich the proposed transactions are consummated; (2) to contribute to thePlans the value of the Leasehold reduced by the sales price paid by thePlans to Airways for the above portion of the Leasehold; and (3) to subleasethe Terminal from the Plans for the duration of the remaining term of theLeasehold which expires in 1998. To the extent the value of the Leaseholdexceeds Airways' 1986 and 1987 plan year funding obligations, it is representedthat the Plans will benefit from pre-funding of the 1988 minimum fundingamount due in September 1989.It is represented that at closing on the proposed transactions, the PortAuthority will execute the following documents: (1) the assignment of theLeasehold to the Plans, and (2) an acknowledgment and consent to the assignmentof the Leasehold, but only if the prohibited transaction exemption is grantedby the Department. In addition, the Port Authority's consent is conditionedupon: (a) Airways and any subsequent occupants (or sublesses) of the Terminalparticipating in the cost of the extensive capital improvement programcontemplated for JFK (the JFK 2000 Project) by the Port Authority; (b)any re-letting of the Terminal to one or more successor sublessees beingsubject to the consent and approval of the Port Authority; (c) the PortAuthority and the Plans splitting 50-50 any rental received from any replacementsublessee, greater than the rental amount due the Plans from Airways; and(d) to the extent that scheduled aircraft arrivals of Airways or any successorare less than 60% of an agreed upon basic schedule, the Port Authority'shaving the right to require Airways or any successor to sub-sublease theunder-utilized portion of the Terminal to other air carriers (hereinafterreferred to as the Use or Lose Provision). 6. Pursuant to the terms of the proposed Sublease, Airways will operatethe Terminal and pay to the Plans a fixed monthly rent of $2.78 millionfor the duration of the Leasehold. The Sublease will expire one day beforethe expiration of the term of the Lease in 1998. The proposed Subleaseis a triple net lease, which places on Airways, the responsibility of allcosts of care and maintenance, all taxes, and all insurance. Under theterms of the Sublease: (1) Airways will pay the first two monthly installmentsof rent on the date the Sublease is executed; (2) Airways shall have theright without the consent of the Plans to make alterations, improvementsand additions to the Terminal, subject to certain limitations; (3) Airwaysshall have the right, subject to certain restrictions, to sub-sublet allor any part of the Terminal or assign its rights under the Sublease withoutthe consent of the Plans; (4) Airways agrees to participate in the anticipatedcosts, construction, maintenance, and operation associated with the JFK2000 Project, to the extent that Airways will be treated in the same manneras that received by all similarly situated passenger airlines at JFK; and(5) in the event Airways defaults on the payment of the rent and does notcure such default within sixty (60) days, the Plans have the right to terminatethe Sublease at the end of any month upon thirty (30) days notice to Airways.As addressed in paragraph ten below, Fiduciary Services, in its capacityas independent fiduciary for the Plans, has reviewed and approved the termsof the Sublease on behalf of the Plans.7. It is represented that the rental income from the Sublease and the ownershipinterest in the Leasehold will be allocated in a manner consistent withthe relative liabilities and funding requirements of the Plans. If suchallocation is employed, the range of percentages of the assets of eachof the individual Plans involved in the sale and contribution of the Leaseholdis estimated to be from 6.8% to 32.9%, with the aggregate value of thesale and contribution of the Leasehold constituting approximately 28.8%of the cumulative assets of the Plans.Airways represents: (1) That such an allocation is fully consistent withthe funding needs of the Plans, (2) that any other arrangement would resultin an imposition of an earlier cash contribution upon Airways, and (3)that such allocation is consistent with the funding waivers granted toAirways and the corresponding pledge agreement with PBGC.Because each payment of rent will increase the non-Leasehold assets ofthe Plans individually and collectively, Airways states that it is reasonableto expect the interest in the Leasehold allocated to each of the Plansto decline within a short period of time. In addition, Airways states thatgiven its financial situation, denial of the contribution of a valuableasset such as the Leasehold to the Plans would be adverse to the best interestof the participants and beneficiaries.8. At the request of Fiduciary Services, the independent fiduciary forthe Plans, Arthur D. Little, Co. (Arthur Little), an independent consultant,was retained by Airways to value the Leasehold. It is represented thatArthur Little has experience in all facets of the aerospace industry, includingspecific work in preparing valuations. It is further represented that ArthurLittle has no common directors nor any existing relationships with Airwaysor the Plans. Arthur Little states that projects conducted in the paston behalf of Fiduciary Services represented less than one percent (1%)of the total revenues of Arthur Little over the periods in which it wasinvolved in such projects.The record contains several appraisals of the value of the Leasehold preparedby Arthur Little, some of which employ different methodologies and whicharrive at different values. In the most recent appraisal, Arthur Littleestimated the fair market value of the Leasehold as of October 31, 1988,to be $172 million. Arthur Little states that in estimating the value ofthe Leasehold, it interviewed officials at Airways and at the Port Authority,toured the Terminal facilities, and had access to all publicly availableinformation relevant to the valuation of an airport terminal. In addition,Arthur Little represented that it had in-house expertise and data on whichit based its estimates of the revenues and expenses associated with theTerminal.It is represented that the methodology used in the appraisal attemptedto project income statements for the Terminal to determine expected annualnet cash flows for the remainder of the Lease term. Income for the Terminalwas derived from a number of sources, including certain fees charged toother airlines for use of similar terminals and rental rates for squarefootage at another JFK terminal recently negotiated between the Port Authorityand another airline. Net cash flows were derived by subtracting actualTerminal expenses from income. It is represented that the present valueof these cash flows, when appropriately discounted, represented the fairmarket value of the Leasehold. In the appraisal, Arthur Little also: (a)Assumed the subject transactions would occur on December 15, 1988; (b)included operating and concession revenue in the calculation of Terminalincome; (c) included the cost of an ongoing asbestos operation and maintenanceprogram (see paragraph 9 below) and the immediate cleanup of certain asbestoscontaining material; and (d) assumed a 14.5% discount rate for risks associatedwith the Leasehold.Fiduciary Services has reviewed the income projections used in the mostrecent appraisal by Arthur Little and concluded that they are reasonable,based on knowledge of the Terminal, demand studies, and familiarity withthe airline industry. Fiduciary Services also concluded that an appropriatediscount rate for valuation purposes should reflect the risks of (a) subleasingthe Terminal to Airways given its financial condition; (b) holding an assetwhich comprises a significant portion of the assets of each of the Plansand which cannot be sold to or financed by a third party; (c) not receivingfull and timely rental payments upon default by Airways and having to finda successor sublessee; and (d) not receiving full and timely rental payments,if Airways should go into bankruptcy and the transaction is treated asa secured financing, rather than a sublease. Based upon these factors,Fiduciary Services concluded that a discount rate of 14.5% was fair, producinga net present value of the Leasehold of $172 million. This, Fiduciary Servicesrepresents, equates to a return of 14.5% on the Plans' investment and contributionvalue and a monthly rental of $2.78 million.9. In December 1987, Airways designated Connecticut National Bank (CNB)to act as independent fiduciary on behalf of the Plans with respect tothe proposed transactions. However, on July 19, 1988, CNB confirmed toAirways that it would be unable to act as independent fiduciary for thePlans and gave as its sole reason for withdrawing its inability to quantifythe economic implications of the presence of asbestos containing materialin the Terminal. Subsequently, Fiduciary Services, a Delaware corporation,was retained by the Committee to act as independent fiduciary for the Plansin connection with the proposed transactions. Fiduciary Services engagedits own experts to review the findings associated with the existence ofasbestos in the Terminal and concluded that the economic implications ofthe asbestos conditions can be quantified and that they are <T3>de minimis. </T3>Moreover, Fiduciary Services has negotiated with Airwaysto enter into an operational and maintenance program, the cost of whichwill be paid by Airways, in order to adequately monitor and control theasbestos containing material in the Terminal.Fiduciary Services is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bear Stearns CompaniesInc. (Bear Stearns Inc.) and is a registered investment advisor under theInvestment Advisers Act of 1940. It is represented that Bear Stearns Inc.,the parent company, will guarantee the performance and obligations of FiduciaryServices. Fiduciary Services represents it is qualified to act on behalfof the Plans with respect to the proposed transactions in that it was establishedin 1986 to serve as an independent fiduciary for employee benefit planscovered by the Act and to perform various other investment-related functionsfor such plans and other institutional investors. Fiduciary Services includesamong its experiences advising plans on asset allocation, diversificationand liquidity, assessment of investment opportunities, selection of investmentmanagers, trust and custody of plan assets, and compliance with the requirementsof the Act bearing on investment decisions and related fiduciary matters.It is represented that Fiduciary Services typically performs its functionsthrough the use of its own expertise and resources and those of its affiliates,such as Bear Stearns andamp; Co., Inc. (Bear Stearns andamp; Co.).It is represented that Bear Stearns andamp; Co. is the nation's eighth largestbroker-dealer and investment bank with $32 billion in assets, as of April30, 1988, and $1.4 billion in shareholders' equity and long-term debt.Bear Stearns andamp; Co. has 13 offices worldwide and approximately 6,000employees. Bear Stearns andamp; Co. offers a range of resources and expertisein financial markets and investment matters generally, including departmentsin corporate finance and business valuation, financial restructuring, mergersand acquisitions, research, equity and fixed income trading, real estate,economic and portfolio analysis, and asset management. Bear Stearns andamp;Co. has rendered opinions regarding numerous proposed investment transactionsbetween pension plans covered by the Act and their corporate sponsors.Fiduciary Services states that it is independent in that there is no prioror existing relationships with Airways or the Plans, other than the servicesto be performed as the independent fiduciary in connection with the proposedtransactions. Fiduciary Services has stated that Bear Stearns andamp; Co.has acted and will act from time to time as a broker for outside investmentmanagers of various employee benefit plans sponsored by Airways, includingthe Plans. The total amount of commissions Bear Stearns andamp; Co. earnedin 1987 as broker for outside investment managers for transactions on behalfof the Plans and other plans sponsored by Airways is represented to beapproximately $37,000. It is represented that such commissions representless than one percent (1%) of the commission income and total revenuesof Bear Stearns, Inc., the parent corporation of Bear Stearns andamp; Co.In addition to hiring Fiduciary Services to act as independent fiduciaryon behalf of the Plans, Airways has also retained Mellon Bank to act ason-going trustee (the Trustee) of those assets of the Plans involved inthe proposed transactions. It is represented that Mellon Bank is independentof Airways and the Plans, except that: (a) It provides services to anotherpension plan sponsored by Airways for its pilots, and (b) is a lessor toAirways, under a lease which expires in 1989, of a single B-747 aircraftwhich Mellon Bank owns for its own account. It is represented that thefees to be paid to Mellon Bank with respect to the proposed transactions,the rental payments made by Airways on the B-747 aircraft, and the feespaid by Airways to Mellon Bank in connection with services provided tothe pilot's plan, in the aggregate, are less than one percent (1%) of therevenue of Mellon Bank. The Committee represents that it has determinedthat the fees proposed by Mellon bank are reasonable for the services contemplatedand that Mellon Bank is qualified to perform those services.By letter dated September 12, 1988, Fiduciary Services formally consentedto its designation by the Committee as independent fiduciary. FiduciaryServices acknowledges that it will be a fiduciary within the meaning ofsection 3(21) of the Act, and in connection with the proposed transactions,will be subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Part 4 ofTitle I of the Act.The Committee in its agreement with Fiduiciary Services (the I/F Agreement)has delegated authority to Fiduciary Services to decide whether the Plansshould enter into the proposed transactions, and if so, to instruct theTrustee, to implement such decision. In addition, Fiduciary Services isauthorized to enforce and monitor compliance with the terms of the Subleaseon behalf of the Plans throughout the duration of the proposed transactions.Under the I/F Agreement, Fiduciary Services is empowered to take such actionsand to direct the Trustee, as in its absolute discretion, it deems necessaryor appropriate to protect the best interest and rights of the Plans andtheir participants and beneficiaries with respect to the proposed transactions.Fiduciary Services may employ, as it deems advisable and in the best interestsof the Plans, such legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, and agents toassist in connection with the operation, preservation, management, defense,custody, and administration of the Leasehold and the property underlyingthe Leasehold.It is represented that Fiduciary Services shall receive reasonable out-ofpocket expenses properly and actually incurred in connection with the performanceof its duties as independent fiduciary, including reasonable fees of outsidecounsel, accountants, appraisers, and other independent agents employedby Fiduciary Services. Further, it is represented that, except to the extentthat Airways shall have paid, the compensation for Fiduciary Services andthe Trustee shall be paid out of the assets of the Plans held in the trustfund.\9\<NOTE/> it is also represented that the Committee has consideredthe primary liability of the Plans to pay the fees, expenses, and compensationto Fiduciary Services and the Trustee in the event Airways is unable tomake such payments. The Committee has determined that in the event of financialfailure of Airways, the need for services to be rendered by an independentfiduciary to the Plans, the desirability of having Plans' assets held byparties other than Airways, the need to maintain continuity of operations,income collection, and benefit disbursements for the Plans, justifies thefees, expenses, and compensation for which the Plans will be liable. TheCommittee has further determined that such fees, expenses, and compensationare reasonable and not less favorable in the aggregate to the Plans thanthe fees, expenses, and compensation which either: (1) Were quoted by othercandidates considered by the Committee for appointment as independent fiduciarywith respect to the proposed transactions, or (2) would be borne by thePlans if the Plans were required to engage any similar independent partiesto perform comparable services.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The Department notes that the statutory exemption undersection 408(b)(2) of the Act regarding the provision of services by a partyin interest to a plan is applicable, provided no more than reasonable compensationis paid for such service.The Committee may remove Fiduciary Services at any time by giving writtensixty (60) days notice to that effect; provided however that FiduciaryServices may not be removed at any time that the Trustee, is entitled toexercise rights and remedies as a result of a default by Airways of itsobligations under the Sublease. Fiduciary Services may resign by givingsixty days written notice to the Committee.10. Airways has represented that it considers the transactions to be unitaryin nature; and thus, has stated that it will not make the in kind contributionwithout the Plans' purchasing in part the value of the Leasehold and enteringinto the Sublease of the Terminal for the duration of the Leasehold term.Fiduciary Services has reviewed Airways representations as to the unitarynature of the proposed transactions and has represented that when takenas a whole the transactions would provide the Plans a prudent investmentunder the circumstances. Nevertheless, Fiduciary Services has examinedeach of the proposed transactions independent of the others to ensure thateach transaction meets the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of theAct. Fiduciary Services represents that in carrying out this responsibilityeither the staff of Fiduciary Services or experts under Fiduciary Services'supervision reviewed extensive information and documentation regardingthe proposed transactions. After reviewing such information, FiduciaryServices has determined that each of the proposed transactions is administrativelyfeasible, in the best interest of the Plans, and protective of the Plansand their beneficiaries and participants.In order to insure the administrative feasibility of the proposed transactions,Fiduciary Services has agreed to prepare and render annually an accurateand detailed accounting of all transactions and other actions taken byit for each of the Plans with respect to the proposed transactions. Inaddition, the Trustee, will account separately for each of the Plans' interestsin the Leasehold and the attributable earnings. Fiduciary Services willkeep all accounts, books, and records relating thereto which will be opento inspection and audit at all reasonable times by an accountant designatedby the Committee, the Trustee, Airways, and their respective agents. FinallyFiduciary Services is broadly empowered to instruct the Trustee to enforcethe terms of the proposed transactions and take necessary action to protectthe Plans' rights.With respect to the in kind contribution of the value of the Leaseholdto the Plans, Fiduciary Services has determined that such contributionpresents the Plans with a unique opportunity to operate with substantiallygreater assets than the Plans would otherwise have and provides enhancedsecurity for the Plans' participants and beneficiaries. Fiduciary Servicesstates that the increase in the Plans assets would provide a justificationfor the contribution, even if Airways were in better financial condition.However, given Airways' troubled financial position, in the opinion ofFiduciary Services, the reasons supporting the in kind contribution areall the more compelling.\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ The 1987 Annual Report on Airways and the Form 10Kfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission reveal net losses andoperating losses of $274.6 million and $113.3 million, respectively. Accordingto the same reports, shareholders equity in Airways at the end of 1987was a negative $245 million.With respect to the effect of the contribution on the Plans' diversificationof assets and liquidity requirements, Fiduciary Services has concludedthat the concentration of assets of the Plans in the Leasehold will notpresent an undue risk and the cash stream generated by the Sublease willenable the Plans to increase gradually the diversification of their investments.With respect to the Plans' liquidity requirements, Fiduciary Services hasdetermined that the other assets of the Plans together with the cash streamgenerated by the Sublease will be more than sufficient to meet the liquidityrequirements over the next 9\1/2\ years.With respect to the purchase of a portion of the value of the Leaseholdby the Plans, Fiduciary Services has concluded that it is in the interestof the Plans and the Plans' participants and beneficiaries. The reasonsgiven by Fiduciary Services in support of this conclusion are: (a) Thesale will result in the Plans receiving a significant prefunding amountof approximately $57 million that would otherwise not be available; (b)the Plans will be placed in as good or possibly better position in theevent a bankruptcy proceeding is brought by or against Airways; and (c)the rental stream under the terms of the Sublease will provide the Planswith a favorable return on the investment.Fiduciary Services has determined that the contribution and the purchaseof a portion of the value of the Leasehold are protective of the rightsof the Plans' participants and beneficiaries, because: (a) The Leaseholdhas been valued by Arthur Little, an independent appraiser, (b) the appraisalhas been reviewed by Fiduciary Services, and (c) the triple net Subleaseand the advance payment of two months' rent will minimize the risk thatany Plans' assets will need to be expended for initial maintenance or othersuch expenses. In addition, Fiduciary Services will be responsible formonitoring Airways' compliance with the Sublease and for instructing theTrustee to take appropriate action to protect the Plans' interests as sublessor.It is represented that in order to protect the interests of the Plans,the assignment and all other necessary documentation of the proposed transactions,including the Sublease and the acknowledgement and consent to the assignmentof the Leasehold from the Port Authority, will promptly and properly berecorded in accordance with state and local law. Also, Fiduciary Serviceswill take all necessary steps to ensure that the interests of the Plansare protected if the Leasehold and the Sublease are viewed as a mortgageproviding security for the funding obligations of Airways. It is representedthat the Plans' interests are protected against property damage and generalliability through insurance policies maintained by Airways, pursuant tothe terms of the Sublease.Fiduciary Services has concluded that the entry into the Sublease withAirways is in the best interest of the Plans. In making this decision,Fiduciary Services took into consideration the fact that (a) Airways hasagreed to Sublease the Terminal for the approximately 9\1/2\ years remainingin the term of the Leasehold; (b) the entry into the Sublease will commencesimultaneously with the other two proposed transactions and will avoidany delay which is particularly important with a wasting asset such asthe Leasehold; (c) the responsibilities and expenses of operating the Terminal,including the rent due to the Port Authority under the Lease of the Landwill be borne by Airways; (d) Airways is in the best position to dischargesuch responsibilities because it is familiar with the Terminal and itsoperations; and (e) the amount of rent to be charged to Airways is calculatedto allow the Plans to recover the appraised value of the Leasehold ($172million) plus a return of 14.5 percent on such value. As noted above, FiduciaryServices has concluded that a rate of return of 14.5 percent is fair andreasonable. Such rate is representative of the risks associated with theproposed transactions, and is particularly desirable to the Plans in viewof their underfunded status.11. Fiduciary Services has determined that the principal risks to the Plansinvolving the Sublease are the possibility of: (1) A default by Airwaysunder the provisions of the Sublease; and (2) the bankruptcy of Airwaysduring the term of the Sublease. Fiduciary Services states that it willtake measures to ensure that in either case the Plans' interests are protected.Despite the potential risks, Fiduciary Services has concluded that thereis a reasonable likelihood that the Plans would ultimately realize a substantialportion of the value of the Leasehold in the event of a default by Airwaysor a bankruptcy proceeding involving Airways.Specifically, with respect to a default, the Sublease permit FiduciaryServices on behalf of the Plans, either to cure the default and then recoveragainst Airways or to evict Airways in order to regain possession of theTerminal and then rent the premises to a successor sublessee. FiduciaryServices has determined, based on knowledge of the airline industry, anda review of demand studies regarding JFK, that the Terminal is in a verydesirable location in one of the busiest metropolitan airports in the world.It is also represented that the Plans and Port Authority share a mutualinterest in keeping the Terminal occupied and that the Port Authority willassist in any efforts to keep the Terminal operating as close as possibleto full capacity. Fiduciary Services conservatively estimates the Plansmay experience a delay of six months in locating a successor sublessee,if Airways defaults, but represents that this factor is reflected in the14.5 percent discount rate used in the valuation of the Leasehold preparedby Arthur Little. Given that the volume of international passenger trafficwill continue even in the absence of Airways, Fiduciary Services beleivesthat there is a reasonable likelihood that a successor to Airways couldbe found at a level of rent comparable to that agreed to by Airways.To the extent a successor pays more rent than Airways, the Port Authorityand the Plans have agreed to split the increase on a 50-50 basis. FiduciaryServices states that provisions for sharing profit on subleasing are commonin commercial leases and that receipt of a 50 percent portion of any increasein rent can only be an added benefit for the Plans.Fiduciary Services also has considered the risks to the Plans in the eventof a bankruptcy petition being filed by or against Airways during the termof the Sublease. After reviewing the current financial condition of Airwaysand discussing this issue with representatives of Airways, Fiduciary Serviceshas determined that there is little risk of Airways filing or having filedagainst it a bankruptcy petition in 1989. Nevertheless, Fiduciary Servicesstates that the risk of Airways' filing for bankruptcy at some point andthe possible effects of such bankruptcy on the Plans was factored intothe determination of the value of the Leasehold and in the choice of theappropriate rate of return (14.5%) on the Plans' investment. If under the bankruptcy laws the relationship between Airways and the Plansis characterized as a Sublease, Fiduciary Services represents it will takeany and all measures to ensure that the Plans' interests are protected,including commencing proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code to require Airwayseither to assume or reject the Sublease within sixty (60) days of the commencementof the proceeding, as required by law. In the opinion of Fiduciary Services,it is unlikely that Airways would seek to reject the Sublease, and if Airwayswere to assume the Sublease, Airways must satisfy all obligations underthe terms of the Sublease, including the rental payments. Even if Airwayswere to reject the Sublease, it is represented that the Plans retain theright to re-let the Terminal to another tenant subject to the Port Authority'sconsent. Fiduciary Services has also considered the consequences should the relationshipbetween Airways and the Plans be treated in a bankruptcy proceeding asa secured financing or mortgage. Because the Leasehold is a wasting asset,Fiduciary Services represents that the Plans should have a reasonable prospectof demonstrating that ``adequate protection'' is warranted to protect thePlans' secured claims and that such protection may be provided in the formof cash payments, additional or replacement liens, or some other appropriatemeasures. Fiduciary Services has also considered the likelihood and effect of a possibleavoidance of the proposed transactions based on a finding that such wereconsidered either preferences or fraudulent conveyances under the bankruptcylaws. Because fair value will be given for the Leasehold, Fiduciary Serviceshas been advised by counsel that the Plans' exposure for a fraudulent conveyanceis insignificant. However, to the extent that any portion of the valueof the Leasehold was recovered from the Plans as a preference, the Planswould be able to assert only an unsecured claim for the avoided value.A preferential transfer is one taking place within ninety (90) days ofthe filing of a petition in bankruptcy. Fiduciary Services maintains thatto the extent granting the proposed transactions sufficiently delays (evenif it does not ultimately preclude) the filing of a bankruptcy petitionby or against Airways, the period for avoiding contributions to the Plansas preferences will have passed, thus protecting the Plans' assets. Finally, Fiduciary Services compared the relative positions of the Plansin the event that a bankruptcy petition were filed against Airways beforeor after the proposed transactions are granted an exemption. FiduciaryServices notes that the Plans could be worse off if Airways enters bankruptcybetween the date the proposed transactions occur and the date when thewaiver payments otherwise would have been paid on January 15, 1989. However,because in Fiduciary Services' opinion the chances are small of Airwaysentering bankruptcy in1989, it believes that in the event thereafter ofbankruptcy by Airways, the Plans would likely be as well or possibly betterpositioned with the Leasehold and the Sublease than without them. In anycase, Fiduciary Services believes that in the event of bankruptcy the likelihoodof the Plans receiving continued income through rental payments under theSublease is probably greater than the likelihood of the Plans receivingincome through continued contributions to the Plans from Airways, if theproposed transactions are not granted. 12. Fiduciary Services reviewed the terms of the Sublease, and the conditionsimposed by the Port Authority in the acknowledgement of consent and assignmentof the Leasehold in order to determine whether any such terms and conditions,specifically those relating to: (1) The allocation of the costs for theJFK 2000 Project, (2) the Use or Lose Provision, and (3) the agreementto split excess rent between the Port Authority and the Plans, will affectthe value of the Leasehold. After examining said relevant documents, FiduciaryServices concluded that the terms of the assignment of the Leasehold, theconsent of the Port Authority, and the Sublease are similar to those thatwould have been negotiated at arms' length by unrelated third parties.It is represented that Airways or its successor, and not the Plans, willbear the cost of the JFK 2000 Project. Because the cost of the JFK 2000Project will not be borne by the Plans, and because under the JFK 2000Project the Terminal will not be disadvantaged as compared to other terminalsat JFK, Fiduciary Services believes that there should be no adverse effecton the value of the Leasehold. Further, in the opinion of Fiduciary Servicesthe Use or Lose Provision in the Sublease will not affect the Lease betweenthe Port Authority and the Plans, nor the value of the Leasehold, and willonly require Airways or its successor to find sub-subtenants for the Terminal.Finally, Fiduciary Services believes that the Plans can only benefit fromreceiving a percentage of any increased rental paid by a successor of Airways.13. In summary, the applicant asserts that the proposed transactions satisfythe statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because among otherreasons:(a) Fiduciary Services, as independent fiduciary for the Plans, has determinedthat each of the proposed transactions is in the best interest and protectiveof the Plans and their participants and beneficiaries; (b) Arthur Little, a qualified independent appraiser has determined thefair market value of the Leasehold;(c) Fiduciary Services has established a fair market value rental for theSublease of the Terminal by the Plans to Airways;(d) Fiduciary Services also has reviewed, approved, and will monitor andenforce the terms of the Sublease between the Plans and Airways;(e) Revenue from the rental payments made by Airways under the Subleasewill be used to diversify the Plans investment portfolio;(f) The contribution and purchase of a portion of the value of the Leaseholdare one-time transactions;(g) The Plans will receive a significant amount of prefunding from thein kind contribution of the Leasehold;(h) The Plans will make a 14.5% return on their investment in the purchaseof a portion of the Leasehold and contribution of the remaining portionof the Leasehold; and (i) Fiduciary Services has determined that the terms of the Sublease aresimilar to those negotiated at arms' length between unrelated third parties.<T3>For Further Information Contact: </T3>Angelena C.

The Plan is a defined contribution money purchase plan. It has 48 participantsand, as of June 30, 1987, net assets of $670,597. The trustees (the Trustees)of the Plan are Ezra Sensibar and Dr. Howard A. Sulkin. Ezra Sensibar isalso a trustee of the Employer, but is neither an employee of the Employernor a participant in the Plan. Dr. Howard A. Sulkin is the President andChief Executive Officer of the Employer and is a participant in the Plan.The Employer is a tax exempt organization under section 501(c)(3) of theCode.2. Pursuant to the recommendation of a committee of Plan participants,the Plan, in January 1987, was in the process of liquidating its investmentportfolio for the purpose of investing its assets in a TIAA-CREF (TIAA)group annuity contract. On January 27, 1987, the Trustees of the Plan weremade aware that if the total vested funds of the Plan were deposited withTIAA by January 30, 1987, the Plan assets would receive 1986 vintage treatmentrather than 1987 vintage treatment. The applicant represents that the termvintage, as used here, means the portion of the annuity accumulation resultingfrom premiums paid and additional amounts credited during a specific period.The Trustees anticipated that the 1986 vintage would yield a higher returnthan the 1987 vintage and, in fact, it did yield a return \1/2\% more thanthat in 1987.3. In order to take advantage of the offer by TIAA, the Plan needed todispose of the Bonds immediately. The first bond was a $50,000 par valueFederal National Mortgage Association mortgage backed trust certificate(FNMA Bond) and the second was a $50,000 par value corporate bond issuedby Citicorp (Citicorp Bond). The FNMA Bond earned interest at an annualrate of 8.65% and matured in March, 1990. The Citicorp Bond earned interestat the rate of 10.5% and matured in October, 1990.4. On January 28, 1987, the FNMA Bond had a quoted value of $52,875, usingthe average of the bid and asked quotations in the Wall Street Journal.In addition, there was accrued and unpaid interest of $1,635.21 owed tothe Plan on the FNMA Bond. The Citicorp Bond was not actively traded andno daily price quotation was available. However, the Plan trustees contactedthe Plan's financial consultant, Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith(Merrill Lynch), who valued the Citicorp Bond in the Plan's portfolio atthe time of the transaction at $51,722.50. In addition, accrued and upaidinterest of $1,495.89 was owed to the Plan on the Citicorp Bond.5. The applicant represents that Merrill Lynch advised the Plan that itwas too late to liquidate the Bonds on the open market, since the normalsettlement time for such transactions was five business days. Further,even if the Bonds could be liquidated on the open market, the commissioncosts would be particularly high because of the small odd-lot amount ofthe Bonds.On January 28, 1987, the Employer offered to purchase the Bonds from thePlan for $108,000 in cash, which offer was reviewed and accepted by thePlan's Trustees. The Plan sold the Bonds to the Employer for their fairmarket value of $52,875.00 and $51,722.50, respectively, for a total purchaseprice of $104,597.50. In addition, the Employer paid the Plan $3,131.10representing the accrued interest due on the Bonds. The difference betweenthe $108,000 in cash transferred to the Plan and the combined fair marketvalue plus accrued interest on the Bonds ($107,728.60) of $271.40 was treatedas a contribution to the Plan for the Plan year ended June 30, 1987. Theapplicant represents that the Plan bore no expenses with respect to thetransaction.6. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction satisfiedthe statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because:(a) The Plan was able to sell the Bonds at their fair market price; (b)the Plan bore no expenses with respect to the sale; (c) the price of theFNMA Bond was determined by reference to the quotations listed in the WallStreet Journal and the price of the Citicorp Bond was determined by anindependent third party; and (d) the immediate sale of the Bonds for cashallowed the Plan to invest its funds in a group annuity contract in sufficienttime to secure the highest rate of return available under such contract.<T3>For Further Information Contact: </T3>Alan H.

The Plan is a money purchase pension plan which had ten participantsas of July 1, 1988. As of July 31, 1987, the Plan had assets of $461,844.Dr. Bettis' account in the Plan had a balance of $120,446 as of July 31,1987.The Plan is sponsored by Edmonds Family Medicine Clinic, P.S., (the Clinic),which proves medical services in Edmonds, Washington. The five trusteesfor the Plan are Robert B. Bettis, M.D., Mark T. Hanson, M.D., Roger B.Olsson, M.D., Joseph G. Petrin, M.D., and Jeffrey F. Schlaemus, M.D., allprincipals in the Clinic. The Plan permits each participant the exclusiveright to exercise control over the selection of assets in his or her account.2. On February 16, 1983, the Plan purchased for Dr. Bettis' separate accounta parcel of unimproved real property (the Real Property) in the Town ofLake Park, Chelan County, Washington, for $25,730.72 from Belden and SandraL. Morgan, unrelated third parties. The Real Property did not produce anyincome during the time it was held by the Plan.3. The Real Property was sold to Jordan and Mary Miller (the Millers),unrelated third parties, on December 31, 1987 for $35,000. The terms ofpurchase included a down payment of $1,500, delivery of a deed of trustfor the benefit of Dr. Bettis' individual account in the Plan as security,and the Note in the amount of $33,500 at 12% interest per annum. The principalamount of the Note is due and payable on January 1, 1991, with installmentsof accrued interest due on January 1, 1989 and January 1, 1990.4. Dr. Bettis and the Millers have now agreed that the Real Property willbe sold to Dr. Bettis. It is proposed that Dr. Bettis take title to theReal Property from the Millers by making a down payment of $1,500 in cashto the Millers, assuming the Note and accelerating the Note by paying hisindividual account in the Plan in cash the total principal amount of $33,500together with accrued interest due as of the date of the payment. Any transferfees and other expenses will be paid by Dr. Bettis.5. On June 1, 1988, Tom Walters, associate member of SREA, of Walters AppraisalService of Chelan, Washington, stated that the fair market value of theReal Property was $35,000.6. On August 23, 1988, Peter Unger, Vice President of the Bank of Californiain Seattle, Washington, an unrelated third party, stated that in his opinionthe value of the Note does not exceed the unpaid principal balance plusany accrued interest due.7. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction willsatisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) Dr. Bettis'individual account in the Plan will receive all principal and interestdue under the Note; (b) the transaction represents a one-time payment incash to Dr. Bettis' individual account in the Plan, which can be easilyverified; (c) Dr. Bettis will pay all fees and expenses due with respectto the transaction; and (d) Dr. Bettis, the only participant whose individualaccount is affected by this proposed exemption, has determined that theproposed transaction would be in the interest of his individual accountin the Plan, and desires that the proposed transaction be consummated.<T3>Notice to Interested Persons:</T3> Because Dr. Bettis in the only personin the Plan to be affected by the proposed transaction, it has been determinedthat there is no need to distribute the notice of proposed exemption tointerested persons.

Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plan is a collectively-bargained, multiemployer pension plan having1,563 participants and total assets of $76,027,686 as of March 31, 1988.The Plan is administered by a board of trustees (the Trustees) consistingof six members. The employee Trustees, who are appointed by Operating Engineers,Local 37 (the Union) acting through its Executive Board, are Messrs. JamesR. DeJuliius, Terry L. Bowman and John R. George. The employer Trustees,who are appointed by employer associations, are Messrs. Harry Ratrie (Chairman),Calvin H. Coblentz and Gus A. Lambrow. The Plan Administrator is DecisionScience, Inc. acting through its employee, Mr. Russell L. Clark. Investmentdecisions for the Plan are made by Investment and Capital Management Corporationof Rolling Meadows, Illinois and Farragut Asset Management, Inc. of NewYork, New York. 2. The Union is an employee organization within the meaning of section3(4) of the Act and a labor organization affiliated with the Building andConstruction Trades Department of the AFL-CIO. The Union represents employeesfor purposes of collective bargaining on terms and conditions of employmentin the geographic area which includes the State of Maryland, excludingMontgomery County and Prince George's County. The employees representedby the Union work primarily in the building and construction industry aswell as related industries. The Union normally has collective bargainingagreements in effect with about 300 employers of which 180 employers areactive at any time. The Union has approximately 2,235 members of whom approximately550 members are retired. 3. OEI is a Maryland corporation that is wholly-owned and controlled bythe Union. OEI's sole purpose is to hold title to real property. 4. Among the assets of the Plan is a parcel of improved real property (ParcelOne), located at 5901-5905 Harford Road, Baltimore, Maryland. Parcel Oneconsists of 10,500 square feet of commercial office space in a subdividedone story brick building. At the rear of Parcel One is a parking lot whichis also owned by the Plan. The Plan purchased Parcel One and the parkinglot on December 28, 1982 for $900,000 from Meatcutters Local 117 Building,Inc., an unrelated party. Since August 1988, the Plan has been leasing2,681 square feet of office space in Parcel One and the parking lot tothe Union for a monthly rental of $1,900 or $9.40 per square foot basedupon market rates. The lease is for a term of five years and has two fiveyear renewal options. The remaining 7,819 square feet of office space comprisingParcel One is occupied by the Plan for purposes of Plan administration.\1\\1\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\The applicants represent that the leasing of officespace in Parcel One by the Plan to the Union satisfies the terms and conditionsof Part C of Prohibited Transaction Exemption (PTE) 76-1 (41 FR 12740,12745, March 26, 1976), and PTE 77-10 (42 FR 33918, July 1, 1977). TheDepartment, however, expresses no opinion on whether the leasing arrangementcomplies with the provisions of PTEs 76-1 and 77-10. Accordingly, the Departmentis not proposing any exemptive relief beyond that offered by PTEs 76-1and 77-10. 5. On behalf of the Union, OEI holds title to real property located at5907-5913 Harford Road, Baltimore, Maryland. Parcel Two consists of 7,500square feet of office space that is situated in the same one story buildingin which space has been allocated to comprise Parcel One. Behind ParcelTwo is a parking facility which is also owned by OEI. OEI purchased ParcelTwo on June 29, 1956 from an unrelated party for a purchase price of $35,000.Parcel Two is not presently encumbered by a mortgage. A unit comprising3,218 square feet of office space is leased to the law firm of Peter G.Angelos, an unrelated party. The 4,282 square feet of remaining officespace in parcel Two is occupied by the Union. 6. In addition to Parcel Two, OEI holds, on behalf of the Union, titleto real property located at 3007 E. Glenmore Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland.Parcel Three, which adjoins Parcel One and Parcel Two, consists of a two-storyframe dwelling and a rear parking lot. On August 4, 1980, OEI purchasedParcel Three for $50,315 from Mr. and Mrs. James B. Steedman, who wereunrelated parties. Presently, Parcel Three is being leased to Ms. JudithL. McNemar (Ms. McNemar), an unrelated party, for a monthly rental of $250.Ms. McNemar uses Parcel Three as her personal residence and the lease expiresin 1991. Parcel Three is not encumbered by a mortgage. 7. Due to increasing staff size and anticipated expansion of existing facilities,the Plan is in need of additional operating and parking space in whichto conduct its activities. Because of these circumstances, the Trusteeshave determined that it would be appropriate for the Plan to purchase additionaloffice and parking space from OEI, an entity owned and controlled by theUnion rather than purchasing such space form an unrelated party. The Trusteesbelieve that if the Plan purchases Parcel Two and Parcel Three form OEI,the Plan's participants will have the indirect benefit of obtaining reasonably-pricedoffice space, Moreover, from an investment standpoint, the Trustees havedetermined that the economic value of having the Plan own Parcel One andParcel Two will enhance the value and marketability of such property asa Plan investment since the Plan will then own the building in its entirety.Accordingly, the Trustees request an administrative exemption from theDepartment to permit the Plan to purchase Parcel Two and Parcel Three fromOEI. 8. The Plan will purchase Parcel Two and Parcel Three from OEI for thefair market value of such properties as determined by an independent appraiser.The consideration will be paid by the Plan in cash. The Plan will not berequired to pay any real estate fees or commissions in connection therewith.After the proposed transaction is consummated, the deeds to Parcel Twoand Parcel Three will be recorded to reflect the Plan's exclusive ownershipof the subject properties.   9. In an appraisal report dated January 18, 1988, Mr. Robert V. McCurdy(Mr. McCurdy), C.R.E., M.A.I., S.R.E.A., determined the fair market valuesof Parcel Two and Parcel Three. Mr. McCurdy, who is unrelated to the partiesinvolved in the proposed transaction, is affiliated with the real estateconsulting firm of Robert V. McCurdy and Company of Baltimore, Maryland.On January 1, 1988, Mr. McCurdy placed the fair market value of ParcelTwo at $280,000 and Parcel Three at $65,000 or an aggregate considerationof $345,000.10. Also subsequent to the proposed sale, the Trustees anticipate thatthe Plan will continue leasing office space in Parcel Two to the unrelatedlaw firm for an indeterminate period. Similarly, but until 1991, the Planwill continue leasing Parcel Three to Ms. McNemar. According to the exemptionapplication, the Trustees do not intend to allow the Plan to lease officespace in either Parcel Two or Parcel Three to the Union or to other partiesin interest.11. Mr. Francis Burch, Jr. (Mr. Burch) has been designated as the independentfiduciary with respect to the proposed transaction.

Mr. Burch represents that he is not related in any way to the Planor to the Union and that he provides no services to either organization.Mr. Burch also states that he has consulted with counsel experienced withthe Act regarding the duties, responsibilities and liabilities imposedby the Act on plan fiduciaries. As a result of this meeting, Mr. Burchrepresents that he acknowledges his duties, responsibilities and liabilitiesunder the Act in serving as a fiduciary on behalf of the Plan.Mr. Burch believes the proposed transaction is an appropriate investmentfor the Plan and is in the best interest of the Plan's participants andbeneficiaries. Mr. Burch represents that the proposed transaction complieswith the Plan's investment objectives. He states that the terms of thesale compare favorably with what would be considered normal business practicebetween unrelated parties inasmuch as the fair market values of the subjectproperties have been determined on the basis of an independent appraisaland the proposed sales terms require the Plan to make a lump sum cash paymentto OEI. Moreover, Mr. Burch believes the value to the Plan and the Planparticipants would be enhanced if the Plan were to acquire both properties.In particular, Mr. Burch notes that the Plan's exclusive ownership of thebuilding comprising Parcel One and Parcel Two would enhance the building'svalue for future development or sale to a prospective purchaser. In addition,Mr. Burch states that by owning the entire building, the Plan would bein a better position to negotiate improved rates for contract and otherservices with various lessees since the existing duplication of serviceswould be eliminated.As the independent fiduciary, Mr. Burch states that it is his intentionto review and monitor all contracts entered into by the parties from theinception of the proposed transaction until its consummation. In this record,Mr. Burch represents that he will represent the interests of the Plan.Mr. Burch also states that he will review all other documentation associatedwith the proposed transaction.12. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfythe statutory criteria for an exemption under section 408(a) of the Actbecause: (1) The purchase of Parcel Two and Parcel Three by the Plan willbe a one-time transaction for cash; (b) the purchase price for Parcel Twoand Parcel Three will be based upon the fair market values of the subjectproperties as determined by an independent appraiser; (c) the Plan willnot be required to pay any real estate fees or commissions in connectionwith the sale; (d) the acquisition of Parcel Two and the adjoining ParcelThree will provide the Plan with a sound investment and reasonably-pricedoffice and parking space; (e) by purchasing Parcel Two from OEI and combiningit with Parcel One, the Plan will be ensuring the marketability of suchproperty; and (f) Mr. Burch, who will serve as the independent fiduciaryand monitor the transaction on behalf of the Plan, has determined thatthe acquisition of Parcel Two and Parcel Three is an appropriate transactionfor the Plan and is in the best interest of the Plan's participants andbeneficiaries.<T3>For Further Information Contact:</T3> Ms. Jan D.

Employees' Profit SharingPlan (the Plan) Located in Roseland, NJ</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">[Application No. D-7749]</ITAG>Proposed ExemptionThe Department is considering granting an exemption under the authorityof section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and inaccordance with the procedures set forth in ERISA Procedure 75-1 (40 FR18471, April 28, 1975). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions ofsection 406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resultingfrom the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code shall not apply to: (1) the loan(the New Loan) by the Plan of $350,000 to Orloff, Lowenbach, Stifelmanand Siegel, P.C. (the Employer), a party in interest with respect to thePlan; and (2) the guarantee of repayment of the New Loan by the principalsof the Employer (the Principals), provided the terms of the transactionsare at least as favorable to the Plan as those obtainable in arm's-lengthtransactions with an unrelated party.Summary of Facts and Representations1. The Plan is a profit sharing plan with 36 participants and total assetsof $4,772,119 as of June 30, 1988. The trustees of the Plan are the nineprincipal shareholders of the Employer. The Principals make investmentdecisions for the Plan. The Employer is a law firm which maintains itsoffices at 101 Eisenhower Parkway, Roseland, New Jersey.2. In 1982, the Employer moved from Newark, New Jersey to its present locationwhere it leases 11,000 square feet of office space (the Lease) from RoselandII Limited Partnership, an unrelated party. The Lease has an initial termof five years and allows three additional five year renewal options. Topay for certain expenses associated with the move, the Employer requestedan administrative exemption from the Department. On February 11, 1983,the Department granted Prohibited Transaction Exemption (PTE) 83-24 at48 FR 6430. PTE 83-24 permitted the Plan to lend $300,000 to the Employer(the Original Loan). PTE 83-24 also provided that the Principals guaranteethe repayment of the Original Loan. The Original Loan was made on March1, 1983. It has been amortized in monthly installments of principal andinterest and is for a duration of 84 months. The Original Loan carriesinterest at the rate of one percent over the prime rate of First NationalState Bank of New Jersey and it contains a floor on the interest rate oftwelve percent per annum. The Original Loan is secured by the accountsreceivable (the Receivables) of the Employer as well as by the personalguarantees of the Employer's Principals. The Original Loan is being monitoredby Mr. Irwin Gedinsky (Mr. Gedinsky) who is serving on behalf of the Planas the independent fiduciary. As of August 31, 1988, the remaining principalbalance due under the Original Loan was $64,285.3. Due to the Employer's growth over the past six years and its anticipatedfuture growth, the Employer represents that it is in need of additionaloffice space. Consequently, the Employer has entered into an amendmentto the Lease to incorporate an additional 3,750 square feet of space contiguousto the original space. The estimated cost relating to expanding into thenew space is approximately $285,000 which consists primarily of leaseholdimprovements, fixtures, furnishings and office equipment. The Employeranticipates remaining at its present location for at least the next nineyears and it may lease even more space in the same building.4. To finance costs associated with the expansion of office space, theEmployer proposes to borrow $350,000 from the Plan. The New Loan will berepaid in 84 successive monthly installments of principal in the amountof $4,166 which will be due on the last day of each calendar month theNew Loan is in effect. Interest on the unpaid principal balance of theNew Loan will be paid at the same time as each principal payment, at anannual rate equal to the greater of: (a) one percentage point above thebase rate charged by First Fidelity Bank, N.A., New Jersey (First Fidelity)of Newark, New Jersey, on the first business day of such calendar monthor (b) twelve percent. The interest rate will be adjusted monthly by Mr.Gedinsky, who has agreed to serve as the independent fiduciary for theNew Loan. The New Loan may be prepaid at any time by the Employer withoutpremium or penalty.5. The New Loan will be secured by an assignment of the Employer's Receivableswhich presently serve as partial collateral for the Original Loan. Theapplicant states that at the time the New Loan is made, the Employer willrepay the outstanding principal balance due under the Original Loan. Asa result of the repayment, the Receivables securing the Original Loan willbe released. The Employer will then execute and file a Form UCC-1 in orderto perfect the Plan's first security interest in the Receivables.6. The Receivables represent the amount due the Employer from bills thathave been submitted by the Employer to its clients for previously renderedlegal services performed by the Employer. On June 30, 1988, the Employerhad total Receivables of $1,186,050. During the twelve month period fromJune 30, 1987 to June 30, 1988, approximately 75.7 percent of the Receivablesoutstanding on June 30, 1987 were collected, 3.6 percent were written offand 20.7 percent remained outstanding. By September 30, 1988, a total of80.1 percent of the Receivables outstanding on June 30, 1987 were collected,10.9 percent were written off as uncollectible and 9 percent remained outstanding.Between June 30, 1985 and June 30, 1988, the Employer collected over 90percent of the Receivables that arose during the three year period.7. At all times during the term of the New Loan, the Employer expects thatthe Receivables will be equal to at least 200 percent of the outstandingbalance due under such loan. If the Receivables are ever less than 200percent of the outstanding balance due of the New Loan, the Employer willpost sufficient additional collateral acceptable to Mr. Gedinsky in orderto maintain the 200 percent collateral to loan ratio. In addition, theemployer warrants to own the collateral used to secure the New Loan freefrom adverse claims, security interest and other encumbrances, other thanthe security interest that the Plan would have in the collateral. Further,the Employer will bear all costs, if any, of appraisal fees in connectionwith valuing the Receivables and all servicing fees in connection withthe New Loan.  9. As additional security for the New Loan, the Principals of the Employerwill give their personal guarantees. As of October 26, 1988, the Principalshad a combined net worth that was in excess of $8 million.  10. The Employer has discussed with First Fidelity, an unrelated party,potential financing arrangements it would extend to the Employer, in connectionwith the expansion of the Office space. First Fidelity is a major New Jerseybank with assets that are in excess of $20 billion. By letter dated October12, 1988, First Fidelity indicated that it would make a loan to the Employeron substantially the same terms and conditions as the New Loan. First Fidelityexplained that the duration of its loan to the Employer would be for 60months with quarterly payments of principal and interest. The First Fidelityloan would be similarly secured as the New Loan and would not have a flooron the interest rate.  11. As explained above, Mr. Gedinsky will serve as the independent fiduciaryfor the New Loan. Mr. Gedisnky is a Certified Public Accountant with over32 years of accounting experience. Mr. Gedinsky is affiliated with theaccounting firm of Granet and Granet of Livingston, New Jersey where heserves as the senior tax partner. Mr. Gedinsky has served in the past asan executor and trustee of many estates and trusts and, at the presenttime, he is serving in such capacity for several entities. With respectto the Act, Mr. Gedinsky has advised his firm's clients regarding the designof pension and profit sharing plans, the administration of such plans (includingthe investment of plan assets) and compliance with the Act. Other thanserving as the independent fiduciary for the Original Loan, Mr. Gedinskyhas no relationship to either the Plan or the Employer. Mr. Gedinsky representsthat he understands and acknowledges his duties, responsibilites and liabilitiesin acting as a fiduciary on behalf of the Plan.  Mr. Gedinsky represents that all payments under the Original Loan havebeen paid in a timely manner and that there have been no delinquencies.Mr. Gedinsky also states that the collateral to loan ratio under the OriginalLoan has always been maintained.  With respect to the New Loan, Mr. Gedinsky states that he has looked atthe specific terms of such loan and he believes it is in the best interestsof the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries because: (a) The proposedinterest rate will be substantially higher than the interest rate the Planwould otherwise earn on the investment of such funds; (b) the durationof the New Loan is fair and reasonable; and (c) the collateral securingthe New Loan is sufficient and adequate to fully protect the interestsof the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries. Mr. Gedinsky also representsthat he has examined the overall Plan Portfolio, considered the cash flowneeds of the Plan, considered the assets that might have to be sold tomeet the liquidity requirements of the Plan, examined the diversificationof the Plan's assets in light of the New Loan and analyzed the New Loanin terms of how it relates to the Plan's investment scheme. In additionto the duties described above, Mr. Gedinsky will monitor the terms of theNew Loan to ensure monthly payments are made by the Employer. In this regard,Mr, Gedinsky will take all actions that are necessary and proper to enforceand safeguard the rights of the Plan and its participants and beneficiaries. 12. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transactions will satisfythe statutory criteria for an exemption under section 408(a) of the Actbecause: (a) The New Loan will be monitored by Mr. Gedinsky, the independentfiduciary, who believes such loan is in the best interests of the Planand protective of the Plan's participants and beneficiaries; (b) the NewLoan will be secured by a first security interest in the Employer's Receivables,which have a value of more than three times the amount of the New Loan;(c) the New Loan will also be secured by the personal guarantees of theemployer's Principals who have a combined net worth that is substantiallyin excess of the New Loan; (d) at all times throughout the duration ofthe New Loan the Receivables will represent 200 percent of the outstandingprincipal balance of such loan; (e) the New Loan will represent less than8 percent of the assets of the Plan; and (f) the Employers will bear allcosts, if any, in connection with the valuing of the Receivables and theservicing of the New Loan.  <T3>For Further Information Contact: </T3>Ms. Jan D.

If theexemption is granted the sanctions resulting from the application of section4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of theCode, shall not apply to the proposed cash sale by the Plan of a certainparcel of unimproved real property (the Property) to Sankara Rao Peruri,M.D. (Dr. Peruri), a disqualified person with respect to the Plan, providedthat the sales price for the Property is not less than the fair marketvalue of the Property on the date of sale.Summary of Facts and Representations1. The Plan is a defined benefit plan which, as of August 23, 1988, hadone participant and total plan assets of $512,820. The trustees of thePlan, and the decision-makers with respect to Plan investments, are Dr.Peruri and his wife, Amar J. Peruri (together, the Trustees).2. The sponsor of the Plan is Peruri S. Rao, Ltd. (the Employer). The Employerwas an Illinois service corporation engaged in the practice of medicinein Grayslake, Illinois. The Employer has been dissolved and no longer existsas a legal entity. Dr. Peruri is the sole shareholder of the Employer andthe only participant covered by the Plan.\12\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Because Dr. Peruri is the only participant in the Planand the Employer is wholly-owned by Dr. Peruri, there is no jurisdictionunder Title I of the Act pursuant to 29 CFR 2510.3-3(b). However, thereis jurisdiction under Title II of the Act pursuant to section 4975 of theCode.3. The Property is a 1.33 acre vacant lot in Kendler's Country Place Subdivisionin Lake Forest, Illinois. The Plan purchased the Property on November 20,1986, from the American National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, anunrelated party, for the sum of $110,000. The Trustees state that the Planacquired the Property as an investment and that the Property has neverbeen leased to, or used by, a disqualified person with respect to the Plan.In addition, neither Dr. Peruri, nor any related party, own any propertywhich is adjacent to the Property.4. The Property was appraised on May 25, 1988, by Donald A. Engel, M.A.I.(Mr. Engel), an independent real estate appraiser in Chicago, Illinois,as having a fair market value of $200,000. Mr. Engel states that the Propertyis located in the western section of Lake Forest, Illinois, in an areawhich is now zoned to permit the construction of high quality, single familyresidences. Mr. Engel notes that this area, which was recently primarilyan agricultural area, is now undergoing steady commercial and residentialdevelopment.5. The Trustees state that the Plan currently has a large unrealized gainon its investment in the Property. However, the Property does not produceany current income and real estate taxes must be paid annually. In addition,improvements to the subdivision in which the Property is located couldcause special assessments to be made to the Plan, as owner, which woulddeplete the Plan's assets. Construction and use of a single family dwellingis the only type of building or activity permitted on the Property. TheTrustees have determined that it would not be economically prudent forthe Plan to finance the construction of a permitted single family dwellingfor rental to third parties.6. The applicant states that benefit accruals under the Plan were ``frozen''as of February 1, 1983. The applicant states further that the Plan willbe terminated in the near future and the assets of the Plan will be distributed.Dr. Peruri would like to be able to receive his distribution from the Planin cash. The Property represents approximately 39% of the Plan's totalassets. In this regard, Dr. Peruri states that he has considered the optionof taking a distribution in kind of the Property as part of his total distributionof the Plan's assets. However, Dr. Peruri states that he wants to ``rollover'' his entire distribution from the Plan either to another qualifiedplan or to an individual retirement account (IRA). Dr. Peruri representsthat he has had difficulty finding a corporate trustee that is willingto hold the Property in either an IRA or another qualified plan.7. The Trustees represent that it would be in the best interests of thePlan to sell the Property. The Trustees state that a sale of the Propertywould relieve the Plan of the ongoing obligation to pay real estate taxeson the Property and would enable the Plan to reinvest the cash proceedsfrom the sale in more liquid and diversified investments. The Trusteesstate further that a sale of the Property would eliminate the anticipatedcosts to the Plan of assessments for improvements in the subdivision inwhich the Property is located.8. Dr. Peruri proposes to purchase the Property from the Plan for $200,000in cash, in accordance with Mr. Engel's appraisal. The Trustees believethat the proposed transaction would be in the best interests of the Planbecause it would eliminate the need for the Plan to find a willing buyerfor the Property. In addition, the Plan would not incur any brokerage feesor other expenses with respect to the proposed sale. The applicant statesthat Mr. Engel's appraisal would be updated as of the date of the saleto ensure that the Plan receives the most current fair market value forthe Property.9. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction wouldsatisfy the statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act because: (a)The sale would be a one-time transaction for cash; (b) the Plan would receivean amount which would be no less than the fair market value of the Property,as established by an independent, qualified appraiser; (c) the Plan wouldnot pay any brokerage commissions or other expenses with respect to thesale.<T3>Notice to Interested Persons: </T3>Because Dr. Peruri is the only participantin the Plan, it has been determined that there is no need to distributethe notice of proposed exemption to interested persons.
