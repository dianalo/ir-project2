Answer: When they believe it's really a tax increase.</LP><TEXT>   Continuing huge deficits and new pay-as-you-go budgetrules have left some corporate and GOP leaders worried thatseemingly attractive tax-cut proposals would inevitably turnout to be a Trojan horse concealing offsetting tax boosts.Add to that mix congressional Democrats' rhetoric for &quot;taxfairness,&quot; and the alert is sounding that any such taxincreases would hit businesses and upper-income taxpayers.   &quot;Politically, any major corporation that comes out todayfor tax cuts is shooting itself in the foot,&quot; says BobPerlman, vice president, taxation, for Intel Corp.   A similar warning is going out to Republicans from anunlikely source: Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the conservativewho a decade ago helped President Reagan slash corporate andindividual tax rates. &quot;I'm trying to get people to look atwhat the final vote would be, and see if that fits theiragenda,&quot; he says.   Sen. Gramm's stance is causing consternation in usuallyadmiring conservative circles, and illustrates just howsharply the terms of tax debates have shifted in Democrats'favor since the tax-cutting heyday of 1981. While Sen. Grammtakes aim against bipartisan measures to cut the payrolltaxes that finance Social Security, others apply the warningof hidden tax increases as well to President Bush's proposalto reduce taxes on capital gains, which Sen. Gramm supports.   &quot;If someone asked us to sign a coalition letter in supportof a capital-gains cut, we'd do it, but we're not out thereactively lobbying,&quot; says Monica McGuire, director of taxationfor the National Association of Manufacturers. &quot;We're toofearful at this point that what might be extracted would betoo painful.&quot;   At the American Business Conference, which speaks for thechief executives of 100 midsized companies, Barry Rogstad,president, says, &quot;We're not pushing capital gains on the Hillright now because I quite honestly think it would befoolish.&quot;   Businesses got a preview of what Democrats mean by &quot;taxfairness&quot; in the bargaining positions that congressionalleaders took during last fall's tortuous bipartisan budgetsummit. At various times, Democrats proposed raising the topindividual and corporate tax rates, and the corporate minimumtax. They also sought a surtax of as high as 20% on peopleearning more than $1 million.   &quot;I'd be the first to say that the business communityraises that concern about higher rates,&quot; says Mark Bloomfieldof the American Council for Capital Formation, a businesscoalition that promotes a capital-gains tax cut. &quot;And I agreewith them.&quot;   But both Mr. Bloomfield and Sen. Gramm hold out the hope,which few others harbor, that proponents of a capital-gainstax cut can successfully argue it would actually raiserevenue through economic growth -- thus making an offsettingtax boost unnecessary. Many studies, including those ofCongress's tax analysts, have shown the tax cut to be a netloser, however; in last year's budget summit, GOP negotiatorsconceded the point. And regardless of the revenue impact,Democrats have made clear that they would extract a big pricefor the tax cut based on their separate argument that it is aboon for the rich.   &quot;I think that the Washington business lobbyists areintimidated by the Democratic Party,&quot; says Rep. NewtGingrich, the No. 2 House GOP leader.   But Mr. Gingrich himself recently removed his name as aco-sponsor of a bill, sponsored by Rep. Tom DeLay (R., Texas)and Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.), that would cut bothcapital-gains and payroll taxes. The Georgian, who onlynarrowly won re-election last fall, says he withdrew hissupport because of his constituents' fears that payroll-taxcuts would threaten Social Security's solvency. Mr. Bush alsohas cited concern for the system in explaining why he opposesa payroll-tax cut.   A number of business groups, especially those representingsmall businesses with heavy labor costs, are supporting apayroll-tax cut despite the fears that it would be pairedwith some tax increase.   &quot;I have no doubt that once a bill goes to the floor,you'll see a flurry of amendments from liberal senators to doa whole lot of horrible things,&quot; says D.J. Gribbin of theNational Federation of Independent Business. But he arguesthat &quot;the momentum is already there for this issue, andeither we can work to divert the momentum so that taxes won'tbe raised, or we sit on the sidelines and bad things for surewill happen.&quot;   His group is spearheading support for a proposal by Sen.Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.) that by 1996 would cut apercentage point from the 6.2% Social Security tax that bothan employer and employee pay on the employee's wages. Topartly offset the revenue loss, the Moynihan proposal wouldraise the cap on wages that are subject to the tax to $82,200from $53,400.   Business supporters will desert if the wage cap is movedany higher than that, Mr. Gribbin says. And other supportersof the payroll-tax cut, such as Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon,the senior Republican on the tax-writing Senate FinanceCommittee, contend that it doesn't necessarily have to bepaid for, since Social Security is technically off-budget.   But some Democratic leaders say any such tax cut shouldstill be paid for, in the interest of fiscal responsibility.They have publicly suggested eliminating the current cap onwages subject to the tax, allowing a reduction in the current6.2% rate to 5.43%. The result would be a huge tax increasefor some employers and wealthy individuals.   A sidelight of this general debate is the dismay over Sen.Gramm's outspoken opposition among his fellow conservatives,who look to the Texan to lead tax-cut fights -- and some dayto run for president. &quot;If Democrats want to raise taxes onthe rich, they're going to do it,&quot; says Dan Mitchell, asenior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservativethink tank. &quot;That's no reason not to have an alternativeagenda.&quot;   Mr. Mitchell was among a group of conservative activistswho met with Sen. Gramm recently, in a session thatparticipants describe as hostile. The senator got a slightlybetter reception when he met recently with House GOP leaders.But, like Senate Republicans, their ranks are divided. Rep.DeLay, who has been pressing Sen. Gramm to support histax-cut bill, says the senator &quot;is basing his strategy on thebad things that Democrats do whenever they get a vehicle fora tax increase.&quot;   Other conservatives see Sen. Gramm's stand as a bid to getthe Bush camp's support -- or, at a minimum, itsneutralitywhen he runs for president in 1996. Says Mr.Mitchell: &quot;Gramm's own political calculus is making him bendover backward to see things the White House's way.&quot;   But Mr. Gramm dismisses such conjecture. Echoing thepresident's opposition to the payroll-tax proposal, hedeclares: &quot;The overwhelming majority of people in the countryagree we should not be messing with Social Security.&quot;   ---                       Costly Cut?
