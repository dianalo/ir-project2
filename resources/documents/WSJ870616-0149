Justice Taney's discussion of the &quot;intent of the Framers&quot; regarding black people was constructed on the doctrine of legislative intent: searching the referents and practices common to the Framers as a means of discerning their intent in the substantive provisions of their enactments. It is akin to rummaging the legislative record that characterizes contemporary court proceedings. We witnessed it recently when the Supreme Court decided that Jews and Arabs qualify as ethnic minorities on the strength of remarks made during deliberations of the Reconstruction Congress.    Unlike legislative intent, which guides the court, original intent is a principle that constrains the American political system, particularly the court. The substance of the principle is republicanism, self-government. The heart of the original-intent debate, therefore, is the insistence that the court is not a free-form interpreter of political necessities for the U.S. In historical context, this means that the Framers erected the court as political censor for the U.S. in form only, not in substance.    As the Founders reiterated, the Constitution was intended as it stood to accommodate the needs of changing circumstances. By changing the Constitution, we only make ourselves more vulnerable to changing circumstances. As drafted, the Constitution was intended to convey power sufficient to cope with transient problems, without changing constitutional fundamentals. That is why we remain free.    How far can we rely on the judgments of jurists who are neither well-affected toward, nor particularly knowledgeable about, the Constitution? If the principal constraint on the court -- subordination to the mechanisms and purposes of republicanism -- is unknown to the justices, can we expect them to perform a function compatible with our political order? That is the real subject at the heart of the original-intent debate. What it suggests is that any notion of our court not founded on original intent constitutes in fact the establishment of the court as an arbitrary and substantive moral censor in the society.    William B. Allen   Professor of Government   Harvey Mudd College   Claremont, Calif.   ---   Your comments confuse alienable rights, actually privileges, derived from the Constitution -- our present form of government -- with &quot;unalienable rights&quot; established by the Declaration of 1776. The Constitution -- the bylaws -- provides for change. But our true charter, which sets forth the purpose of our political society as an international corporation, is based upon &quot;the laws of nature and of nature's God&quot;: unchangeable natural and divine law as expressed by Hugo Grotius, the father of international law. In the Dred Scott case, Douglas and the court relied upon the Constitution; Lincoln upon the Declaration.    Moreover, constitutional law is like civil law, deductive. Common law is inductive, based upon precedents. Each new case should not go back to a previous judicial opinion; it goes back to the law.    John W. Brabner-Smith   Director   Institute of Jurisprudence   Washington   ---   You are correct in saying that Brown v. Board of Education is inconsistent with the theory of original intent and that any criticism of that decision would be politically dangerous. There is a way to express this criticism: Propose a constitutional amendment outlawing segregation. Such an amendment could be defended as a means of making the prohibition of segregation invulnerable to changes in theories of constitutional interpretation. It also would permit the repudiation of the objectionable arguments underlying the court's decision, which made that decision -- although very good in its immediate effects -- such a dangerous precedent.    Donald F. McCabe   School of Historical Studies   Institute for Advanced Study   Princeton, N.J.   ---   Lincoln had more to say about the changing interpretation of the Constitution. The following is inscribed on his memorial in Washington:    &quot;I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change. With the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.&quot;    John C. Howett Jr.   Harrisburg, Pa.</TEXT></DOC>
