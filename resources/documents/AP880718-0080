The decision at the special session was unanimous, even thoughArmenia _ which has supported the effort by the region ofNogorno-Karabakh to separate from Azerbaijan _ is represented onthe Presidium.   At the same time, the Presidium ``made provision for measuresthat would ensure the region's real autonomy as well asunconditional fulfullment of a comprehensive program for its socialeconomic and culutural development,'' Tass said. The Presidium isthe government's highest executive body.   Nagorno-Karabakh has been part of the mostly Moslem Sovietrepublic since 1923, although three-quarters of its 160,000inhabitants are ethnic Armenians, who are predominantly Christian.   On July 12, the legislature of the Delaware-sized district votedto secede from Azerbaijan and join neighboring Armenia, butAzerbaijan's government voided the decision hours later, calling itillegal.   The 1977 Soviet Constitution requires that any of the nation's15 constituent republics agree before any change can be made in itsborders.   Both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, which has voted to accept theregion, asked the central Soviet leadership to intervene in thedispute, which has kept the Caucasus on the boil with ethnictensions since February and has triggered strikes that have costmore than $100 million.   The Presidium, headed by President Andrei A. Gromyko, has morethan 30 members and includes top government and Communist Partyofficials including Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the party's generalsecretary, and top leaders from all 15 republics.   Tass said representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan andNagorno-Karabakh would first deliver reports to the Presidium andthat members of the executive body would take part in the debate.It gave no estimate of how long the meeting might last or when adecision could be expected.   Because of the constitutional provision that gives Azerbaijan aneffective veto over any change in Nagorno-Karabakh's status, it wasuncertain what moves the Presidium might take.   Tass said Gromyko opened the session by noting that thesituation in Nagorno-Karabakh had worsened since the Presidium lastdiscussed the issue on March 23, when it rejected as``intolerable'' the Armenian campaign for annexation.   ``The search for the right solution,'' the 78-year-old Soviethead of state declared, ``should be conducted within the frameworkof the Constitution of the U.S.S.R., socialist values and mutualrespect for the opinion, traditions and national dignity of everypeople.'   Gromyko's reference to the Constitution may have signifiedhigh-level opposition to the transfer of sovereignty.   Any action taken by the Moscow leadership will be keenlyfollowed by other ethnic groups now demanding more say about theirfuture, including the Baltic peoples of Lithuania, Latvia andEstonia and the Crimean Tatars.   The dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh began in February, when themountainous region's legislature voted to ask Azerbaijan andArmenia to consent to the transfer of sovereignty.   Armenia's legislature agreed June 15, but Azerbaijan'sparliament rejected the request two days later, setting the stagefor the breakaway declaration by Nagorno-Karabakh's lawmakers.   The dispute has triggered street demonstrations and strikes byArmenians in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia itself since February. Ithas sparked ethnic violence, including rioting on Feb. 28 in theAzerbaijani city of Sumgait in which 32 people, 26 of themArmenians, were killed.   Gorbachev made a personal appeal for calm to the people ofArmenia and Azerbaijan on Feb. 26, but the turmoil only brieflysubsided.   A multimillion dollar economic and social development planannounced by the government and party for Nagorno-Karabakh alsofailed to placate Armenians, who consider the enclave part of theirhistoric homeland.   Since May 23, a general strike has shut down industries andoffices in Stepanakert, the administrative center ofNagorno-Karabakh, and a sympathy strike called July 4 in Armeniaand its capital, Yerevan, has persuaded thousands to stay off thejob.   Yerevan party chief M.S. Minasbekyan told Armenians ontelevision that ``in the days of strikes, the republic has lostsome 70 million rubles ($113 million),'' the official Tass newsagency reported from Yerevan late Sunday.   Minasbekyan said that for each day the strike continues, 32apartments will go unbuilt.   Tass reported over the weekend that ``the situation in theNagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region is becoming more tense with theapproach'' of today's meeting of the Presidium of the SupremeSoviet.</TEXT></DOC>
