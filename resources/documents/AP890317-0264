The identical increases in the Labor Department's Producer PriceIndex mean that prices one stop short of the retail level have risenat an annual rate of 12.6 percent so far this year.   Not since March and April of 1981 have prices risen so sharplyfor two months in a row. Wholesale prices rose 4.0 percent last year.   Stock and bond prices tumbled after Friday's report. The DowJones average of 30 industrial stocks plunged 50 points in the firsthalf hour of trading, and closed down 48.57 at 2,292.14. Theevidence of resurgent inflation renewed traders' fears that theFederal Reserve Board will push interest rates higher.   That would increase the government's cost of financing the $2.7trillion national debt, which would be bad news for President Bush,who is trying to trim the budget deficit without raising taxes.   Bush, speaking to reporters as he returned to Washington fromColorado, said his administration would ``always be vigilant againstinflation (and) never relax our concern.''   He said the best way to beat inflation would be an agreement withCongress to reduce the deficit and called Friday's report, ``Anotherclarion call to do something.'' Negotiators from Capitol Hill andthe White House will exchange proposals next week on bringing downthe deficit.   Bush's remarks amount to a shift in his rhetoric. Previously, thepresident has said he is not overly concerned with inflation andinterpreted economic reports less negatively than the FederalReserve.   Many economists had dismissed the January inflation news,including a 0.6 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index, thelargest in two years, as at least a partial aberration and hadpredicted only a moderate 0.4 percent climb in wholesale prices inFebruary.   With the latest report, ``it's difficult to put a happy face onit,'' said Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Ortner. ``There's noother interpretation that can be put on it other than it shows apickup in inflation.''   Prices in both January and February were pushed up by soaringenergy and food prices, but the cost of other items, which aregenerally more stable, increased at a worrisome rate in February aswell.   Wholesale food prices rose 1.2 percent last month, the steepestincrease in 13 months. They had risen 1.1 percent in January.   Meat and most other food items rose, while eggs dropped 15percent after rising 20.1 percent in January. Food prices were ledby 35.3 percent increase in vegetables, including a huge 158 percentrise in tomato prices.   Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University said beefprices should continue to rise through the spring, until rancherscan rebuild herds that were culled by extra slaughtering during lastsummer's drought.   He said fruit prices will continue to rise, at least temporarily,because fruit grown domestically in hot houses is more expensivethan Chilean fruit held off supermarket shelves because of thecyanide scare.   Energy prices jumped 2.4 percent overall in February, following a4.9 percent increase a month earlier. The latest surge was led by a4.1 percent rise in gasoline prices, the same as January's increase,and a 1.9 percent advance in the cost of natural gas. Fuel oilprices fell 3.1 percent, recovering somewhat from an 11.6 percentsurge a month before.   Ratjczak said he expects further increases in energy costs as thevacation driving season begins. Crude oil prices, at $20 a barrel,are at a 17-month high, propelled by the success of oil-producingnations in controlling output.   Wholesale prices, excluding the volatile food and energycatagories, rose a brisk 0.6 percent in February, up from a 0.4percent rise a month earlier. Toilet paper, prescription medicines,books and flatware prices all increased substantially.   The overall February increase left the Producer Price Index forfinished goods at 111.7, meaning that a hypothetical selection ofgoods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $111.70 last month. Thatwas up 70 cents from January and $5.60, or 5.3 percent, fromFebruary 1988.   Despite the severe price hikes in February at the finished goodslevel, increases earlier in the production process were moremoderate. Prices at the intermediate level rose 0.5 percent whilethe cost of crude goods dipped 0.1 percent after two months ofincreases above 3 percent. A loaf of bread is an example of an itemat the finished goods level, flour at the intermediate level andwheat at the crude level.</TEXT></DOC>
