The proposed rule providedthe opportunity for interested parties to submit comments on these proposedregulations on or before March 27, 1989.The numbering system for Parts 1310 and 1313 has been revised from theproposed regulations to be consistent with the numbering in existing regulationsin 21 CFR Part 1300.Thirty-four interested parties filed comments. A section-by-section analysisof the comments and the DEA's consideration of them are set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="85">Part 1310_Records and Reports of Listed Chemicals and Certain Machines</ITAG>Several comments were received stating that the Piperidine Report (DEAForm 420) and its relevant regulations be deleted from this section. Toavoid any confusion, DEA wishes to clarify that the previous Part 1310,to include the DEA Form 420, the seven-day and the semiannual reports,is deleted and replaced by the current Part 1310. <ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions (andSection; 1310.01)</ITAG>Fourteen comments addressed the definitions of ``regulated person'' and``retrievable'' and the exemptions to a ``regulated transaction'' as beingunclear, confusing, or not in compliance with the Act. The DEA has redefinedthe term ``regulated person'' to more closely parallel the definition of``person'', as used elsewhere in Title 21 (See 21 CFR 1301.02(j)).One comment stated that the definition of ``regulated person'' should beexpanded to include the parent and subsidiaries, affiliates and relatedcompanies. However, it is DEA's view that companies that are separate legalentities will be treated for the purposes of these regulations as separate``regulated persons''.Four comments asked whether a licensed customs broker is in any sense a``regulated person'' and also exprssed concern about the role of commoncarriers. The broker becomes a regulated person only when it meets thedefinition of a chemical importer or exporter, as explained in andSection;1310.01(f)(1) (ii), andSection; 1313.02(b) and andSection; 1313.02(f).Several comments took exception to andSection; 1310.01(f)(1)(i), which establishesthe exemption for certain domestic, lawful transactions for ``agents andemployees''. The comments stated that the proposed exemption would addconfusion to the clear language of the Act, would create the need for excessive,unnecessary and unintended recordkeeping and reporting and would be redundant.It is the intent of the regulation to ensure that records are availableand that the ability exists to assign specific responsibility. As such,specific definition of those persons who are covered by the exemption isnecessary. One comment objected to andSection; 1310.01(f)(1)(i) by addressing the unrelatedtopic of warehouses and public terminals. Exemptions which apply to warehousesand public terminals are specifically covered under andSection; 1310.01(f)(1)(ii).One comment noted the incorrect reference mentined at the end of andSection;1310.01(f)(1) (ii) and (iii); ``this section'' and ``this title or titleIII''. DEA concurs and the wording has been changed to reflect the properreference.It was noted by DEA that part of the exemption relating to tableting machinesand encapsulating machines specified under andSection; 1310.01(f)(2) hadbeen inadvertently omitted from the proposed regulations. The missing languagehas been incorporated into this subsection.One comment requested a clarification of the term ``manufacture''. Threecomments questioned if the Act applied to chemicals ``used in the manufacture''of products manufactured under the approval of the Federal Food, Drug,and Cosmetic Act. It was not the intent to regulate ``use or consumptionin manufacture''. A regulated transaction does not cover receipt of listedchemicals, except by a regulated person. Also, a specific exemption fromthe term regulated transaction is provided for a ``chemical mixture'' asset forth in andSection; 1310.01(g).Two comments took exception to the use of ``readily'' in the definitionof ``retrievable'' (andSection; 1310.01(h)), stating that timeliness shouldnot be a primary concern and that it adds nothing to the definition. Clearly,one of the purposes of the Act is to provide law enforcement access toinformation which is accurate and can be responded to in a timely manner.Therefore, timeliness is a major concern.Three comments addressed the need to define the terms ``tableting'' and``encapsulating'' machines, as regulated by the Act. DEA has incorporatedthe definitions into the final regulations (andSection;andSection; 1310.01(i) and (j)). One comment asked for specific clarification of the statusof a specific encapsulating machine which is addressed with this addeddefinition. The proposed andSection; 1310.01(i) is redesignated as paragraph(k).<ITAG tagnum="84">Substances Covered (andSection; 1310.02)</ITAG>Several comments addressed the 30 days advance notice of additions of substancesas listed chemicals, specified in andSection; 1310.02(c), as being insufficient,inadequate, and in need of improvement. These parties have misinterpretedthis subsection. Prior to implementing the addition or deletion of substancesas listed chemicals, DEA will publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a proposed rule allowing 30 days for comments.It has been and will continue to be this agency's practice to provide forreasonable effective dates and sufficient time to establish compliancewith the regulations at the time any final order is published adding anew chemical.One comment suggested that DEA adopt a similar mechanism described in Section6053(b) of the Act for adding new chemicals to the list. That section providesfor the Attorney General to forward to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) any proposed regulations for OMB's comments and recommendations.DEA currently forwards all proposed rules and final rules to OMB for reviewpursuant to E.O. 12291, except those required to be made ``on the record.''Since this is not an ``on the record'' rulemaking, all proposals for addingor deleting chemicals from the list of listed chemicals will be reviewedby OMB. One comment requested DEA to include a period of time for establishing``regular customers'' and ``regular suppliers'' after adding a substanceas a listed chemical. Although the Act does not contain a provision forthis additional period, DEA recognizes the usefulness of this suggestionand intends to provide an opportunity for such submissions under any finalorder which may be issued under andSection; 1310.02(h). Several comments addressed the need for DEA to specifically identify thelisted chemicals by means of a numbering system already in use by the chemicalindustry to minimize uncertainty regarding which chemicals are regulated.DEA has reviewed the three numbering systems specifically mentioned inthe comments (CAS, TSUS, and Schedule B) and has determined that they weredesigned for other purposes and do not specifically meet the needs of theAct. In addition, there are overlaps and repetitions within each of thesesystems which may cause additional confusion. However, DEA will produce a reference guide as an aid to the regulatedindustry.<ITAG tagnum="85">Persons Required To Keep Records and File Reports (</ITAG>andSection;1310.03) Three comments addressed a reference missing from andSection; 1310.03. Thissection should end ``* * * shall keep a record of the transaction as specifiedby andSection; 1310.04 and file reports as specified by andSection; 1310.05.''DEA agrees with these comments and has made the appropriate modifications.<ITAG tagnum="84">Maintenance of Records (andSection; 1310.04) </ITAG>Several comments requested further explanation of the phrase ``the principalplace of business'', as specified in the proposed andSection; 1310.04(c).DEA has inserted additional language into this subsection clarifying thatany regulated person who conducts regulated transactions at more than onelocation shall keep records at each location. To allow flexibility to companieswith multiple locations, a provision for a single central recordkeepinglocation is provided. However, each regulated person operating at multiplelocations where records are stored must devise a system to ensure thatthe recordkeeping and reporting requirements are not being evaded. Thissubsection was subdivided to facilitate a better understanding of its purpose.One comment suggested that records be maintained for at least five to sevenyears. This recommendation would be inconsistent with the specific timelimits for keeping records established by the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Reports (andSection; 1310.05) </ITAG>Several comments requested further clarification of the terms ``extraordinaryquantity'', ``uncommon method of payment'', and ``unusual or excessivelosses''. These terms apply to situations which appear to be outside theframework of a normal business transaction. The chemical industry is expectedto understand the nature of its legitimate business transactions and mustmake informed decisions as to whether the above terms apply to any of theirtransactions. DEA intends to make available informal guidance, as opposedto regulations, to assist the chemical industry in meeting this requirement.Two comments requested clarification of the term ``nearest'' DEA officementioned in andSection;andSection; 1310.05(a) and (b). This regulation hasbeen reworded to reflect that contacts are to be made to the DEA Divisionaloffice for the area in which the regulated person making the report islocated. DEA office locations are available in telephone directories andwill be available in DEA guidelines. Sixteen comments addressed the reporting requirements for quantitativeand cumulative thresholds as being vague and ambiguous and also requestedfurther clarification. The threshold limits apply only to the maintenanceof records under Part 1310 and for import/export transactions under Part1313 and do not automatically trigger the filing of reports on regulatedtransactions. It was not the intent of DEA to imply that reporting wasrequired for virtually every chemical transaction that exceeds the quantitativeor cumulative thesholds. To avoid the unintentional confusion concerningthe application of quantitative and cumulative thresholds, DEA has removedsubsection (c) from andSection; 1310.05 and placed it under andSection; 1310.04(f)where it is more appropriate. Reports are still required for any transactionswhich meet the specific reporting requirements of andSection; 1310.05. Several comments addressed the level of the threshold quantities. One commentrequested that these quantitative thresholds be replaced with percentageamounts, relative to the previous year's experience. Comments from lawenforcement agencies expressed that the proposed thresholds were too highfor chemicals not used in the production of pharmaceuticals and suggesteda zero threshold for these chemicals. Among the comments, there was noconsensus nor were any alternatives provided. The figures outlined in theregulations were arrived at after substantial internal study and discussionswith industry. DEA intends to be flexible with experience regarding thresholds,but these these thresholds will remain for the initial implementation ofthe Act. One comment requested DEA to establish an upper threshold limit in whichshipments which exceed these thresholds are not regulated. This is notprovided for in the Act and cannot otherwise be justified at this time.As suggested by several comments and to assist in the structuring of anindustry monitoring system, the cumulative threshold provision (andSection;1310.04(f)) has been revised to assess the quantities involved on the basisof a calendar month, rather than on a 30-day period as originally proposed.One comment proposed that DEA consider having each supplier send in monthlycompilations of all chemical shipments in a format similar to the reportingcurrently required for pharmaceuticals under control of the ControlledSubstances Act. DEA cannot levy this as a requirement as it is not authorizedby the Act. DEA has added a sentence to andSection; 1310.05(a)(3) clarifying which regulatedperson is responsible for reporting an in-transit loss. The supplier isresponsible for reporting the loss to DEA. Section 1310.05(a)(4) specifiesreporting requirements for domestic transactions only for tableting machinesand encapsulating machines. DEA will propose the export reporting requirementsat a later date.<ITAG tagnum="84">Contents of Records and Reports (andSection; 1310.06) </ITAG>To avoid confusion, DEA has deleted the reference to ``reports'' in andSection;1310.06(a). Also, six comments were received concerning the telephone numberrequirement, identification of customers, and the reporting burden. DEAhas deleted the telephone number as required information on the record,but the telephone number, where obtainable, is required on reports madeto DEA and on the declarations for exports of listed chemicals. Three comments stated that DEA has substantially underestimated the reportingburden on regulated persons. Several modifications referenced above willserve to reduce the reporting burden and DEA deems the estimate to be accurate.As provided, future comments regarding this burden estimate should be directedto OMB, as specified in andSection; 1310.06.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proof of Identity (andSection; 1310.07)</ITAG>Fifteen comments were received regarding the requirement to ``identifythe other party'' involved in a regulated transaction specified in andSection;1310.07. A distinction has been made between elements of proof of identityfor domestic transactions and export transactions. To further clarify whenthis requirement must occur, the phrase ``at the time the order is placed''has been added to andSection; 1310.07(a).Several comments addressed the need for alternatives to obtaining the signatureof a purchaser or the purchaser's agent due to the ever increasing numberof orders generated electronically, the blanket purchase orders negotiatedat the beginning of each year, and the fact that in most sales the sellerdoes not receive a document signed by the buyer.This section has been modified to provide flexibility to firms in meetingthe requirement based upon normal business practices, but maintaining theneed for the clear and provable establishment of the identity of the otherparty. The rule provides that prior to an initial transaction with a newcustomer, the parties document the proof of identity and authorized signature.This authorized signature can be maintained on file but must be updatedannually. The initial transaction record must reflect a unique identificationnumber and the signature of the authorized agent. If a firm chooses, subsequenttransactions need not have the signature of the authorized agent; however,the supplier must ensure that the purchaser/authorization has not changed.Also, this section has been modified to include acceptable identificationfor domestic electronic orders, such as computer passwords.<ITAG tagnum="85">Part 1313_Importation and Exportation of Precursors and EssentialChemicals</ITAG>Two comments recommended that throughout this Part the word ``notification''be used rather than ``declaration'' in describing DEA Form 486. The DEAForm 486, Precursor and Essential Chemical Import/Export Declaration, isthe required method of notification which the Administrator has establishedfor chemical imports and exports.One comment requested an exemption to filing reports of precursors andessential chemicals for activities between companies and foreign subsidiarieswithin the same corporation. Such an exemption would be inconsistent withthe requirements of the Act.Several comments suggested that DEA be consistent in the wording used todescribe when to file a DEA Form 486. Therefore, the subsections throughoutthis Part that contain the words ``provided'', ``furnished'', and ``filed''have been changed to ``received''. However, for transactions covered byandSection; 1313.12 and andSection; 1313.21, a DEA Form 486 must still be receivedat DEA not later than 15 days prior to the date of importation or exportation.Based on numerous comments regarding the compromising of confidentiality,the difficulty in keeping the form with the shipment, and the form's utilityin the foreign country, the five-part DEA-486 has been changed to a three-partform, eliminating foreign distribution for both import and export. TheAct provides the Attorney General authority to require such form as hedeems appropriate for the purpose of notification, and DEA Form 486 meetsthis requirement.Two comments challenged the language of andSection;andSection; 1313.13(a) and1313.22(a) that imports (or exports) of chemicals must be for ``medical,commercial, scientific, or other legitimate uses''. DEA cannot conceiveof another purpose for such importation or exportation, other than forillicit purposes. This is the very concept for which this legislation wascreated, and the wording remains unchanged.Also, the terms ``the regulated, chemical importer'' under andSection; 1313.13(c)(1)and ``the regulated, chemical exporter'' under andSection; 1313.22(c)(1)were considered unclear. The proposed phrases are redundant, and the word``regulated'' has been deleted from both subsections.Several comments discussed possible variances in amounts reported on DEAForm 486 and the actual quantity imported/exported, due to, for example,evaporation or seepage during shipping. Historical knowledge of any lossesdoes not relieve the regulated person from reporting the amount receivedor shipped. Companies should be able to document normal experiences andthe actual quantity exported from the United States or foreign countryshall be reported on DEA Form 486.Two comments requested DEA consider using existing import/export documentsrequired by other federal agencies in lieu of a DEA form. Several federalagencies regulate imports and exports, each with different authority andjurisdiction. However, DEA does not operate within the mandates and regulationsof these other agencies. The Act clearly provides DEA the authority topromulgate its own regulations independent of other federal agencies.Two comments asked that DEA allow the use of telefax equipment to filenecessary declarations. Although not an item for inclusion in the regulations,DEA has already established this capability in anticipation of the Act.The DEA telex number for import/export transactions is (202) 307-8570.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope (andSection; 1313.01)</ITAG>One comment stated that the term ``those sections'' in andSection; 1313.01was unclear. This section has been clarified to read ``that section'',specifically referring to Section 1018 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 971).<ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions (andSection; 1313.02)</ITAG>Two comments urged that the definitions of ``regulated person'' and ``regulatedtransaction'' outlined in Part 1310 either be included or incorporatedby reference in Part 1313. DEA agrees that such a modification would clarifythat those terms also apply in Part 1313 and therefore the definitionshave been restated in andSection; 1313.02.Four comments suggested that the word ``article'' in the definitions of``chemical export'' and ``chemical import'' in andSection;andSection; 1313.02(a) and (c) be changed to conform with the language in the Act. DEA hassubstituted the term ``listed chemical'' wherever the word ``article''is mentioned.Two comments addressed the phrase ``that is not in conflict with the lawsof the country to which it is intended for import'' as part of the definitionof ``chemical export''. A new definition has been added which deletes thisphrase. A new section (andSection; 1313.25) has been added in which DEA willpublish a notice of foreign import restrictions on listed chemicals ofwhich the DEA has knowledge.One comment recommended the ``exporter of record'' be considered the exporterand that the ``importer of record'', as defined in the U.S. Customs ConsumptionSummary, be the chemical importer. These definitions have been modifiedto ensure specific and clear responsibility is assigned. The importer/exporterof record as defined in the comment may not have all of the facts relevantto the transaction. The revised definition has been modified based on commentsand input from the U.S. Customs Service and now specifies the responsibilityfor submission of the export declaration to meet the requirements of theAct.Several comments questioned the criteria used in determining ``an establishedbusiness relationship'' and suggested that in defining an established businessrelationship DEA accept previous transactions in non-regulated productsas sufficient to establish a business relationship for purposes of theAct. Some of these comments also addressed the phrase ``and accepted by''mentioned in the term ``regular customer''. All comments were reviewedcarefully and many changes were made in this area. The term ``establishedbusiness relationship'' has been defined separately for imports and exportsand incorporated into andSection; 1313.02. Only previous transactions inthe specific listed chemical apply in meeting an established business relationship.Also, the phrase ``and accepted by'' has been deleted from the definitionof regular customer.One comment stated that the definition of ``chemical importer'' was ambiguousas it relates to the jurisdiction and customs territory of the United States.The appropriate definitions have been modified with input from the U.S.Customs Service.One comment found the statement ``* * * from the jurisdiction of the UnitedStates into the customs territory of the United States * * *'' as ambiguous.This is a standard definition used in distinguishing tariff laws from allother applicable laws.<ITAG tagnum="85">Importation of Precursor and Essential Chemicals Requirement of Authorizationto Import (</ITAG>andSection; 1313.12)andSection;andSection; 1313.12 (a) and (b) have been rewritten to clarify whenthe filing of DEA Form 486 must be accomplished. Subsection (c) was createdto address the waiver of the 15-day notification requirement as it pertainsto filing a DEA Form 486. These modifications were made based on commentsDEA addressed previously under Part 1313.<ITAG tagnum="84">Contents of Import Declaration (andSection; 1313.13)</ITAG>One comment recommended that DEA permit the regulated community to usebonded warehouses to store listed precursor and essential chemicals ifthe appropriate import notice either has not been given in a timely manneror is deemed insufficient. The use of a bonded warehouse has no bearingon the requirement to submit a DEA Form 486 for any importation meetingor exceeding the quantitative thresholds. Any importation meeting or exceedingthe quantitative thresholds and found not to contain the appropriate documentationwould be in violation of the Act and subject to the penalties outlinedin the Act.Several comments addressed the requirement in andSection; 1313.13(c)(4) toinclude the license number for importers on the DEA Form 486 emphasizingthe unavailability of this information. This requirement has been deletedfrom the regulations and the DEA Form 486.<ITAG tagnum="84">Distribution of Import Declaration (andSection; 1313.14)</ITAG>The five-part Precursor and Essential Chemical Import/Export Declaration(DEA Form 486) was changed to a three-part form, as previously mentionedunder Part 1313. Previously designated copies 1 and 2 for foreign distributionhave been eliminated and copies 3, 4, and 5 have been renumbered, withthe new copy 1 being the regulated person's copy, the new copy 2 beingDEA's copy, and the new copy 3 being the U.S. Customs Service copy.One comment suggested that the DEA From 486 was contrary to the U.S. CustomsService's program to require electronic or ``paperless transfers'' of forms,etc., by 1990. This Act responds to a current specific law enforcementneed. Future administrative provisions will be considered as experiencedictates.<ITAG tagnum="85">Waiver of 15-day Advance Notice for Chemical Importers (</ITAG>andSection;1313.15)The question was raised concerning provisions for ``emergency shipments''for new customers. DEA cannot foresee any life threatening emergency whichcould render the 15-day notice established by the Act as impractical. DEA,as has been its practice, will attempt to provide assistance to the regulatedindustry in truly exigent circumstances.Several companies proposed different scenarios which they believe wouldmake it difficult, if not impossible, to file the DEA Form 486 15 daysprior to importation. The law is very clear on this issue and this requirementis unchanged.DEA's authority was questioned concerning the statutory notice functionwhich was described as a ``premarketing clearance and registration.'' DEAdoes not recognize this as a premarket clearance, only as a 15-day notificationperiod in order for this agency to perform the responsibilities formallyenvisioned in the Act.One comment objected to the use of the word ``grant'' in andSection; 1313.15(b)and andSection; 1313.24(b), as it relates to regular supplier and regularcustomer status, on the ground that its use was not authorized by Congress.These subsections have been rewritten to parallel the language of the Act.Three comments were received concerning DEA's authority to require informationspecified in andSection; 1313.15(c)(1-8) and the confidentiality of the information.This subsection has been rewritten keeping in mind the concerns of theindustry and the needs of DEA. DEA will take action to ensure confidentialityis maintained within DEA. This agency has handled proprietary informationunder the Controlled Substances Act for years and has established proceduresand experience in this area.One comment expressed concern about the requirement that chemical importersmust supply the identity of each foreign chemical supplier within 30 daysfrom the promulgation of these regulations. This requirement is clearlyoutlined in the Act.Five comments questioned the relevancy of the requirements of andSection;1313.15(g) and andSection; 1313.24(f). DEA agrees that these subsectionsare covered by Part 1310 and has deleted both from the final regulations.One comment recognized inconsistencies of andSection; 1313.15(h) with previouslystated sections. To correct these inconsistencies, the referenced citationwas changed to andSection; 1313.12, and the phrase ``for all chemical imports''was eliminated.One comment stated DEA does not have the authority to rescind regular supplierstatus. DEA has determined that andSection;andSection; 1313.15 (i) and (j)were redundant as this information is already specified in andSection; 1313.15and has been deleted. These changes will make the regular supplier determinationmore workable.The subsections within andSection; 1313.15 have been renumbered to reflectthe above changes.<ITAG tagnum="85">Exportation of Precursors and Essential Chemicals Requirement of Authorizationto Export (</ITAG>andSection; 1313.21)Two comments addressed the phrase ``that is not in conflict with the lawsof the country to which it is intended for export'' as expressed in andSection;1313.21(b). DEA will publish a notice of countries which have imposed restrictionsfor listed chemicals. Section 1313.25 has been created for this purpose.It will be the obligation of the regulated industry to review the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for these notices. Where such notices have beenpublished, there is a presumption that the regulated persons have madegood faith efforts to familiarize themselves with these restrictions andwill abide by them.<ITAG tagnum="84">Contents of Export Declaration (andSection; 1313.22)</ITAG>Two comments requested that the phrase ``authorized to export'' be deletedsince the remaining language is sufficient for DEA's purposes. DEA agreeswith these comments and has deleted this phrase from andSection; 1313.22(b).Five comments were directed to the complex and time-consuming proceduresinvolved in the return of exported chemicals which were refused, rejectedor otherwise undeliverable. The procedures have been reevaluated, and newprocedures have been established to expedite the return of the listed chemicals.The shipment must be returned to the regulated person as soon as possible.A written notification outlining the circumstances must be forwarded toDEA following the return within a reasonable time.<ITAG tagnum="84">Distribution of Export Declaration (andSection; 1313.23)</ITAG>The modifications to DEA Form 486 are explained under Distribution of ImportDeclaration. In regard to exports, the new copy 3 must be presented tothe U.S. Customs Service along with a copy of the Shippers Export Declaration.<ITAG tagnum="84">Waiver of 15-day Advance Notice for Chemical Exporters (andSection;1313.24)</ITAG>One comment requested that a mechanism be provided to give the U.S. CustomsService notice that the 15-day notification requirement has been waived.This suggestion has been incorporated into the DEA Form 486. One comment suggested that filing DEA Form 486 for each shipment to regularcustomers would be unmanageable and recommended quarterly or yearly regularcustomer reports. This suggestion is not in accordance with the Act.One comment recommended that at the time of initial notification an exporterbe permitted to apply for ``regular customer'' status for all listed chemicals,even if within the preceding two-year period the customer has not purchasedall of the listed chemicals. DEA will not recognize regular customer statuswithout a business relationship having been established for each specifiedchemical.One comment recommended adding the words ``if known'' to the end of andSection;1313.24(d)(3). DEA concurs with this requested addition and has moved thissection to a new definition contained in andSection; 1313.02(j).One comment recommended that DEA allow up to 120 days to supply completecustomer lists to the Administrator after publication of these regulations.The Act specifically states that the regular customer list shall be receivednot later than 30 days after the publication of the final regulations.One comment stated that DEA does not have the authority to disqualify aregular customer. Section 1018(c)(1) of the Act states specifically thatthe Attorney General ``may disqualify any regular customer'' as specifiedin the Act.Two comments stated DEA had no authority to limit the 15-day advance noticewaiver for listed precursor chemicals based on the Convention Against IllicitTrafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Section 1313.24(j)has been deleted from the final regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Transshipment and In-Transit Shipment of Precursors and EssentialChemicals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Advance Notice of Importation for Transshipment or Transfer (andSection;1313.31)</ITAG>Five comments were received addressing this section. Two comments askedfor clarification of ``regulated person'' as it relates to transshipmentsthat originate from foreign countries. The party who caused the transshipmentor transfer is responsible for notification.Two comments discussed the need for waiver requirements. Providing a waiverof the reporting requirements would only encourage diversion into the illicitmarket. To prevent the United States from having its borders facilitatethe transfer of chemicals for illicit operations, the United States needsthe time to determine the legitimacy of the customer.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Shipments (andSection; 1313.41)</ITAG>One comment requested clarification on how this authority will be exercised.The comment also pointed out that the Act states the ``legal and factualbasis'' for suspension must be provided by the Administrator. The Act specifiesthe requirements for the suspension of a shipment and the wording of theregulation has been changed to parallel the language of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Hearing (andSection; 1313.54)</ITAG>Two subsections have been added to clarify the procedures governing hearings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous</ITAG>Two comments requested DEA to include in the regulations the penaltiespertaining to noncompliance with the Act. Regulations are not the appropriateforum for listing penalties; they are clearly set forth in the Act.The Piperidine Report (DEA Form 420), OMB approval 1117-0017, is eliminated.The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration hereby certifiesthat this final rule will have no significant impact upon entities whoseinterests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.601 et seq. This rule is not a major rule for purposes of Executive Order(E.O.) 12291 of February 17, 1981. Pursuant to sections 3(c)(3) and 3(e)(2)(C)of E.O. 12291 and section 6053(b) of Pub. L. 100-690, this rule has beenreviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
