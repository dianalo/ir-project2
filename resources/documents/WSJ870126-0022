But the balance within the coalition was altered, suggesting that the junior partner will have a greater voice in policy decisions.    Support for Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union dropped sharply, while the junior coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, showed strong gains. Within the opposition, the Social Democratic Party, or SPD, failed to even match its poor showing in the last previous election, in 1983, while the Greens boosted their standing by apparently attracting disaffected SPD voters.    The shift of forces inside the conservative coalition is likely to give greater weight to the junior FDP's calls for sweeping tax cuts and greater deregulation of the German economy. It is also likely to strengthen the position of Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the veteran Foreign Minister and former FDP leader, who has been under fire from the right wing of Mr. Kohl's party in recent months.    &quot;Our voters expect us to put our promises into action,&quot; said Helmut Haussmann, secretary general of the Free Democrats. &quot;That means a continuation of Genscher's policies of detente and a big program to reduce taxes.&quot;    According to official results, the senior CDU; its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union; and the FDP together drew 53.4% of the vote, down from 55.8% in the 1983 election. Most polls before the election estimated the coalition partners would win 55% or more of the vote.    The Social Democrats captured 37% of the vote, below the 38.2% they won in 1983. The radical Greens made the biggest gains of any party, increasing their share of the vote to 8.3% from 5.6%.    Early indications showed that the coalition partners would lose about 10 of their 278 seats in the current Bundestag, West Germany's parliament, but would still command a sizable majority. The Greens increased their representation in parliament by about 14 seats from the 27 previously held, while the SPD lost about four seats from 193.    Although Mr. Kohl's coalition was easily returned to office, the chancellor and some of his colleagues expressed disappointment over the Christian Democrats' big losses.    The CDU/CSU won just 44.3% of the vote, down from 48.8% in 1983 and their worst showing since 1949. Mr. Kohl described the outcome for the CDU as &quot;distressing,&quot; and blamed it on a lower-than-usual turnout of voters and complacency among some of his party's supporters.    But some commentators said the poor CDU showing and the gains by the FDP, which boosted its share of the vote to 9% from 7%, may have been caused by voters' worries of a growing right-wing influence in the coalition. In particular, Franz Josef Strauss, the fiery CSU Bavarian chief, repeatedly has called for a rightward shift in West German foreign policy.    Leading Social Democrats clearly were disappointed by the outcome. &quot;We failed to meet our election goals,&quot; conceded Johannes Rau, the party's candidate for chancellor. Mr. Rau's campaign suffered as the party, divided into bickering left and right camps, failed to unite behind his candidacy.    And in winning less than 40% of the vote, which was thought by many to be an important barrier for the SPD to reach, Mr. Rau's own political future within the party is an open question. In his home state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the candidate did well, suggesting he will return as state governor relatively unscathed. However, his role within the party at a national level may diminish.    Willy Brandt, the former chancellor, has said he intends to resign as party chairman after the election. And many observers believe that the SPD, in an effort to win back voters it lost to the Greens, will choose a more leftward-leaning chairman to lead the party over the next few years. One possibility is the Saarland's governor, Oskar Lafontaine, who favors a loosening of Germany's ties to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Another name mentioned frequently is Volker Hauff, a member of parliament who served in the cabinet of former chancellor Helmut Schmidt. </TEXT></DOC>
