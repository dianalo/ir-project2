Today's outdoor furniture has such style -- acertain formality and traditional sensibility -- that it can be broughtindoors. Porches, kitchens and family rooms, even living rooms can be accentedwith casual furniture.;    Even within the categories of aluminum, wicker,redwood, teak, resin and iron, there's never been a wider selection of styles.Biedermeier in cast aluminum? It's yours from Veneman. Art deco gone hightech? Try Tropitone's extruded aluminum &quot;Hollywood,&quot; whose flat, wide-ribbedarms are wide enough for a gin fizz.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Peninsula Home  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  INSIDE AND OUTTHE CONTEMPORARY STYLE AND VERSATILITYOF CASUAL FURNITURE MAKE IT AN OPTION FOREVERYTHING FROM OUTDOOR SETTINGSTO PLACES THAT EVEN HAVE A ROOF OVERHEAD  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related story on this pageElaine Markoutsas is Midwest editor of Metropolitan Life magazine.  </MEMO><TEXT>     English country? You'll want the classic Lutyens bench, crafted intraditional teak by BarlowTyrie, a British-based company that has beenproducing architect Sir Edwin Lutyens' Edwardian designs since the 1920s.;   Detail is back. A dark green wrought-iron bench from Meadowcraft and a Frenchrocker from Woodard both boast brass finials. Textures, mottling, washing andother sophisticated finishes are being employed on outdoor pieces. Upholsteryis highlighted with dressmaker detailing such as contrast cording and ties.;    Furniture frames are not limited to white, black, vanilla and pastels. Green(forest and sage) and earthy shades are common. A variety of colored stainsare giving wood a fresh look. Choice of color and fabric in outdoor furnitureclosely echoes what is happening inside the house.;    Resin is now availablein dark green and charcoal gray. Wicker can be woven so that patterns orborders stand out in contrast.;    Outdoor fabrics are available in manystyles, from English florals and paisleys to tropicals to what some arecalling salsa-Southwest. More formal patterns, such as jacquards and damasks,are not neglected, and very fine suede and leather look-alikes aremanufactured to withstand the elements.;    Gliders (chairs or settees thatmove back and forth like swings) and motion chairs (a trade term for a chairthat rocks or tilts) have been streamlined, the telltale mechanisms visuallyminimized. Samsonite's Regatta collection is a good example, and so is thepatio set from Brown Jordan's Infinity Collection, which includes flex ormotion chairs that designer Fred Doughty says &quot;have no strings or gizmos thatcall attention to it.&quot;;    The design of casual furniture reflects a growingsophistication.;    &quot;The outside of the house is part of the inside,&quot; saidHerbert Saiger of Troy, Ohio, who has designed for the casual furnitureindustry for 40 years. &quot;Decks and patios are an extension of the total livingspace, and they're used that way.&quot; It is now perfectly appropriate to havecozy plump cushions and the look of upholstered furniture outdoors.;    Whatis most striking, perhaps, is the emergence of familiar shapes and stylesrendered in unexpected materials -- Herbert Saiger's elegant French countryrocker, for example, made of iron instead of bentwood.;    Juxtaposingmaterials offers attractive design options. Some pairings seem quite natural:wicker, rattan and iron, for example, marry well. At the higher end, LutenClarey Stern Inc. is known for benches and chairs that combine rattan withwrought iron. Palacek has more affordable prices. Ralph Lauren demonstratedhow magnificently mahogany and wicker can join in a drop-dead but expensivecollection a few seasons back.;    &quot;There will be some very startlingcombinations on the market,&quot; predicts Cliff Andrews, vice president of designand communications at Tropitone. &quot;The integration of woods and metals, evensemiprecious stones, may be part of the innovations.&quot;;    Casual designconsciousness is already filtering into accessories as well, with outdoorlighting, decorative planters and window boxes and garden tools beginning toshow a little more pizazz, both in color and style.;    Gardener's Eden, whichalong with Smith andamp; Hawken is an excellent catalog source for such accessories,even solves the problem of unsightly hoses. It features a sturdy, textured40-pound pot crafted from high-fired adobe clay. The hose tucks in and wrapsneatly around a central cone, which keeps it from getting tangled. It'savailable in four earthy shades, including basic terra cotta, for $79.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ELAINE MARKOUTSAS  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910417  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  711  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 17, 199100108285,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
