Levine, whose arrest led to the biggest insider-trading scandal in Wall Street history, was released from prison yesterday to serve the rest of his two-year term in a halfway house, federal officials said.    Mr. Levine was transferred from the Lewisburg Federal Prison Camp in Lewisburg, Pa., about 200 miles west of New York, to a halfway house, which wasn't identified, said Kenneth Treon, a counselor at the prison camp.    He said Mr. Levine remained under federal custody but was given the opportunity to participate in the Federal Bureau of Prison's halfway house system, in which inmates with good records move into a work-release program within six months of their parole date.    &quot;He had a clear conduct record,&quot; Mr. Treon said. &quot;He had no violations of institution rules or records.&quot; Martin Flumenbaum, Mr. Levine's attorney, wasn't immediately available for comment.    Mr. Levine, formerly a mergers specialist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., was arrested in May 1986 after the Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of making $12.6 million in profits through illegal trading on inside information.    He was sentenced to two years in prison on charges of securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. He began serving his term in April 1987. Mr. Levine is eligible for parole beginning this September. </TEXT></DOC>
