VAX minicomputers provide core data-processingfacilities in the hub sites.andP;  Personal computers (PCs) and workstations fromdozens of vendors link into the LAN from both WHOI's campus facilities andship-based laboratories.andP;  DEC, Apple Computer Inc., Concurrent ComputerCorp., Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. are among thecompanies whose machines can be found on campus and on ships.andM;One important service on the LAN is Omnet Inc.'s electronic mail system.andO;Omnet specializes in providing electronic mail services for individuals inthe earth, atmospheric and oceanographic sciences.andM;SYSTEMS INTEGRATION visited WHOI, including a stop aboard the Research Vessel(R/V) Oceanus, for a close-up look at how the Institution's network hasdeveloped.andM;1.andP;  Before the reel network ...andM;Five years ago, data communications at WHOI was initially a matter ofhard-wiring between terminals in the Clark Building, where most users weresituated, and a PACX digital switch from Gandalf Data Inc. The switch wasconnected to host machines (predominantly VAX/VMS) in Clark, which is locatedon the Quissett campus.andP;  Users in outlying areas employed 300-baud to1,200-baud modems to access the hosts over leased lines.andP;  This system wasrelatively slow and costly and did not let researchers communicate.andM;2.andP;  Cable gets installed ...andM;Four years ago, a broadband cable was laid between Clark and a hub site onthe other campus in Woods Hole village, establishing WHOI's first networkupgrade.andP;  &quot;When the local cable TV company installed the town's cable system,we had them lash our broad-band cable to their own,&quot; says Maffei.andM;Ultimately, the cable also interconnected WHOI to three other scientificinstitutions located in the same area:andM;* The Marine Biological Laboratory;andM;* The U.S.andP;  Geological Survey's Branch of Atlantic Geology;andM;* The National Marine Fisheries Service's Northeast Fisheries Center.andM;Within WHOI's system, RF (radio frequency) modems from Sytek (since mergedinto Hughes LAN Systems) permitted 9600-baud asynchronous communications withother devices.andP;  &quot;Besides giving us higher speed in reaching hosts, we couldbypass local telephone charges,&quot; points out Maffei.andM;Still, users with PCs had to cope with the limitations of terminal emulationwhen entering the system.andP;  And even 9,600-baud speeds were inadequate forquickly transferring and manipulating large files from supercomputers andother remote computing resources.andM;Now, WHOI was ready to move Ethernet LANs into campus buildings, link thesenetworks over the broadband backbone cable and ensure the transmission ofdata in a variety of protocol formats.andP;  Several technologies were integratedto achieve these goals.andM;3.andP;  Ethernet goes to school ...andM;Three years ago, Ethernet was placed only in the Clark Building.andP;  DEC usedthick Ethernet cables and adhered to the IEEE 802.3 10Base-5 standard.andP;  Thisstandard promotes 10M-bits-per-second (bps) Ethernet transmission on cablestretching up to 500 meters.andM;Desktop computers and workstations grew popular among scientists in otherbuildings.andP;  More thick Ethernet systems followed in their wake.andM;4.andP;  Pipe the bridge aboard ...andM;Over the last three years, WHOI chose two types of networking devices(routers and bridges) at different stages of the network's evolution to linkthe local Ethernet systems over the broadband cable.andM;A prototype version of Proteon's ProNET 10 p4200 router, able to transmittraffic over broadband cable at 10M bps, was first installed.andP;  This routerwas placed in one hub building on each campus.andP;  &quot;Nothing else at the timecould run at this speed over broadband at the distance involved between ourcampuses,&quot; says Michael Pare, a WHOI systems integrator.andM;Proteon's routers predominantly forward traffic based on TCP/IP protocols.andO;Other router features: transmission of data packets over the best availableroutes and source quenching.andP;  Source quenching lets overloaded routers tellcomputers on the network to slow down transmissions.andM;The Proteon routers were supplemented by 3Com's Internetwork Bridge/1 (IB/1)5M-bps Ethernet-to-broadband bridges, operating in conjunction with thecompany's RFM 5 modems.andP;  The bridges were eventually placed on severalEthernet local segments and at the same hub sites as the routers.andP;  IB/1s alsoconnected LANs at the Marine Biological Lab, U.S.andP;  Geological Survey andNational Marine Fisheries Service to WHOI's network.andM;&quot;Although slower than Proteon's routers, the IB/1 worked over the distance weneeded,&quot; says Pare.andP;  &quot;We also decided that 5M bps was fast enough for thecomputers we had.&quot;andM;Other factors also drew WHOI to the bridge.andP;  For example, Proteon's ProNET 10over broadband was a nonstandard technology.andP;  When the option emerged ofusing a more fully supported broadband product like the IB/1, Maffei turnedto that.andM;Besides, &quot;The broadband implementation of ProNET 10 requires the use ofgreater bandwidth as more nodes are added,&quot; says Maffei.andP;  &quot;This is not a veryefficient way to use broadband.&quot;andM;Bridges enhance the connectivity of Ethernet segments over the broadbandbackbone.andP;  One such segment is located at the Marine Biological Lab.andP;  IB/1,as a network bridge, keeps the Lab data packets on their own segment andpasses along only those packets destined for hosts outside that segment,&quot;says Pare.andP;  &quot;Only internetwork traffic goes across the bridge.andP;  That helpsimprove network performance.&quot;andM;For the same reason, the WHOI later split off one group of heavy computerusers within the Clark Building into its own Ethernet subsystem with 3Com'sNETBuilder IB/2000.andM;The bridges are protocol-independent devices.andP;  Under normal circumstances,the bridges at WHOI forward packets formatted in protocols other than TCP/IP,including:andM;*  AppleTalk;andM;*  Xerox Network Systems (XNS);andM;*  DECnet;andM;*  Novell NetWare;andM;*  Local Area Transport (LAT).andM;&quot;Proteon's routers could take on other formats besides TCP/IP, but that wouldrequire adding expensive modules for each additional protocol to theTCP/IP-based product,&quot; says Maffei.andP;  The IB/1s can also serve as backups forthe routers for TCP/IP transmission.andP;  If a router fails, the TCP/IP filterson the bridges are cleared away.andM;The bridges and routers use different topologies.andP;  Proteon routers areconfigured as token-passing devices, while 3Com's bridges employ carriersense multiple access/collision detection (CSMA/CD) technology.andP;  Thesebridges and routers avoid interfering with each other by accessing differentchannels on the broadband cable.andM;5.andP;  WHOI does the twist...andM;In its current evolution, the LAN has added fiber optics and twisted-pairEthernet to the existing media mix.andM;Fibronics International Inc. helped install multimode fiber-optic lines in astar configuration between the hub site on each campus and other buildingslinked to the hubs.andP;  Chipcom's ORnet transceiver and active star coupler ateach hub enable the Institution to interconnect all devices complying with10M-bps Ethernet specifications over a fiber-optic system.andM;&quot;We picked fiber to interconnect our buildings because it is a robust,high-speed environment, immune to electromagnetic noise,&quot; explains Maffei.andO;&quot;And fiber can be extended beyond the distance limitations of thick Ethernetcable.&quot; According to Chipcom, the maximum distance of active star-based fiberLANs is four kilometers, more than enough to satisfy intra-campus needs.andM;Hubs at the two campuses remain connected by broadband cable.andP;  Pare notesthat the Institution hopes eventually to link these hubs by single-modefiber.andP;  Single mode is expensive.andP;  But it runs even greater distances thanmultimode and uses powerful laser beams, rather than multimode's lightemitting diodes (LEDs), to guide network traffic.andM;The institution is also considering the Fiber Distributed Data Interface(FDDI) standard for future fiber lines.andP;  FDDI is currently available only formultimode fiber, but some companies have equipment to interface single andmultimode media, according to Pare.andM;While all this was going on, changes were being made to office networkswithin the buildings.andP;  Since the Institution was installing a new privatebranch exchange (PBX) system, networkers seized the opportunity to use thetwisted-pair lines being wired into each building as the basic physical mediafor Ethernets.andM;&quot;Twisted-pair is much easier to deal with than coaxial cables fortransmitting Ethernet,&quot; says Maffei.andP;  &quot;When individuals change offices, youdon't have to knock new cables through the walls; you just make theappropriate connections in the wiring closet.&quot;andM;Several technologies were brought together to ensure that Ethernet overtwisted-pair could accommodate the growing number of computers.andM;Two locks in each officeandM;For example, a data jack, as well as a voice jack, was placed in each office.andO;The data jack accepts three different connections.andP;  One is for 3Com's CS/200communications servers, which give dumb terminals access to the network.andP;  Theother connections handle Ethernet devices and a PhoneNET system fromFarallon.andP;  PhoneNET enables Apple Macintoshes to run Ethernet overtwisted-pair wires.andM;The Institution had two choices for an Ethernet-over-twisted-pair standard:the emerging 10Base-T or 10Base-2.andP;  Using 10Base-T would have posed a seriousproblem for networkers because only eight wires are available in the datajack for data connections in each office.andP;  Since four wires are required tosend and receive network traffic to a single Ethernet node with 10Base-T,only two machines could be used in an office, without additional wiring.andM;&quot;Putting in such wiring could be costly,&quot; says Pare.andP;  &quot;We needed a betterway.&quot;andM;What is the solution? Run 10Base-2 thin Ethernet cables between computers ineach room and feed them into 3Com's MultiConnect PairTamer.andP;  PairTamer, adevice known as a balun, uses impedance matching to connect twisted-pair tocable.andM;&quot;If you have two systems with different impedances and send an electricalsignal through them, that's like having two liquids with differentviscosities,&quot; says Maffei.andP;  &quot;You end up reflecting back some of the signal,which screws up network processors.andP;  PairTamer prevents that by matching the50-ohm impedance of thin Ethernet with the 100ohm impedance typical oftwisted-pair.&quot; Consequently, a thin Ethernet network can be extendedthroughout a building over twisted-pair.andM;Equally significant: Up to 25 machines can be linked to one PairTamer.andP;  Inturn, PairTamer needs only one pair of data jack wires to send and receivetraffic.andP;  Thus, up to 100 machines could be used in an office that has fourPairTamers interfaced with the data jack.andP;  P.andM;WHOI networkers put multiport repeaters from 3Com and Cabletron into thewiring closets to repeat Ethernet signals along the various media now foundin different buildings: thick and thin cable, twisted-pair and fiber optics.andM;All LANs on dockandM;While the Institution was upgrading its campus network, it was simultaneouslyjoining researchers to offsite colleagues and computing resources.andM;Example: A microwave system connects WHOI to the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology (MIT) in Cambridge, some 80 miles away.andP;  Together the two run ajoint doctoral program.andM;One of the services on this system is a high-speed, 1.5M-bps hookup to MIT'sown network.andP;  Rockwell International Corp.'s MVR-6E microwave radios are usedin the system in conjunction with M505 RF modems from Fairchild Data Corp.andO;and Proteon's p4200 routers.andM;WHOI is a member of the TCP/IP-based University Satellite Network (USAN),sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF).andP;  USAN provides access tosupercomputers and associated facilities at the National Center forAtmospheric Research in Boulder, CO. Both the MIT and USAN connections, inturn, link WHOI researchers to NSF, Department of Defense and otherinterconnected networks known collectively as the Internet.andM;A satellite dish on the Clark Building and transmission equipment fromVitalink Communications Corp. provide access to USAN.andP;  The same Proteonrouter used in the microwave system and WHOI's broadband cable feedsinformation to and from USAN.andM;Ship-to-shore communication is also an important component of theInstitution's research needs.andP;  Direct-dial telephone, facsimile, telex anddata traffic can be sent from most points around the globe over a satellitesystem operated by the 62-member International Maritime SatelliteOrganization (Inmarsat) headquartered in Washington, DC.andP;  Three satellites ingeostationary orbits over the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans and a groupof earth stations located around the world are the core of Inmarsat'snetwork.andM;WHOI ships reach points on land through Telebit Corp.'s T2500 modems, whichtie into onboard, high-quality voice switches installed by Inmarsat.andP;  Theswitches access the Inmarsat system via ship-based satellite dishes.andM;Individuals on these ships can simply direct-dial their messages to any phonenumber, including that of a T2500 modem located on campus.andP;  As at theInstitution, diverse shipboard computers are standardized on TCP/IP andEthernet physical media.andP;  Thus, ship-to-shore transmission is carried outusing the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) standard.andP;  SLIP runs TCP/IPover serial lines between modems and can be used for such functions as remotelog in, electronic mail and file transfer.andM;Incoming calls to ships are also easily made through the Inmarsat system.andO;Each ocean has its own area code-dial 871 for the Atlantic-and each ship hasits own access number.andP;  Thanks to the new phone switches carried by thesevessels, an automated call attendent takes incoming calls and directs them tothe right extension.andM;Communicating over Inmarsat costs $10/minute.andP;  Because of this expense,researchers use the system predominantly for sending electronic mail.andM;Maffei's concept: &quot;Shipnet.&quot; Shipnet would be equivalent to the midlevelregional or discipline-oriented networks sponsored by NSF, such as USAN.andP;  TheTCP/IP-based Shipnet would be open to members worldwide.andM;Unlike Inmarsat, a point-to-point network, Shipnet would also enable shipsfrom member institutions to exchange information and to contact other remoteresearch platforms.andM;WHOI also wants to establish direct data connections with its submersibles.andO;The three-man Deep Submergence Vehicle (DSV) Alvin, for example, presentlymaintains voice communications with its mother ship, the R/V Atlantis 11.andO;But data obtained in dives must be stored and carried back to the ship forinput to shipboard computers.andP;  &quot;The trick is to communicate data through thedifferent vertical temperature gradients of water,&quot; says Maffei.andP;  &quot;We areworking on an acoustic modem link that would accomplish that.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
