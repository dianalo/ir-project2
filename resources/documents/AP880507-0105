DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan on Saturday urged the Senateto swiftly ratify a pending arms control treaty and ``enable us toget on with the job of eliminating these nuclear missiles.''   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., has tentativelyset Wednesday for the start of Senate debate on the treaty, which,if ratified, would require the elimination of U.S. and Sovietground-launched intermediate- and shorter-range nuclear weapons.   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed the treatyat their summit in Washington in December, and Reagan submitted itto the Senate the following month.   The president said Saturday he is confident that the treaty willbe ratified. He has said previously that he hopes this will be donebefore he goes to Moscow for another meeting with Gorbachev on May29-June 2.   The two superpowers are currently negotiating another treaty,dealing with longer-range intercontinental missiles, but that pactis not expected to be completed before the Moscow summit.   Reagan's remarks, in his weekly radio address, made no referenceto Byrd's demand for written assurances that the treaty will coverfuturistic weapons, like those using laser rays.   An administration official, however, speaking on condition henot be identified, said the issue has been discussed with theSoviets and is currently being discussed with Senate leaders. Theofficial said the administration was confident an accomodationcould be reached.   Reagan spoke from Camp David, the presidential retreat in theCatoctin Mountains of Maryland.   ``It is my hope that, in recognition of the important role theyplay in this process, the 100 members of the United States Senatewill now proceed expeditiously in their debate,'' he said. ``Senateappoval of the treaty will enable us to get on with the job ofeliminating these nuclear missiles.''   Reviewing the history of the pact, the president said, ``We heldfast to what we wanted, and we got it. And this is what comes fromnegoitiating from strength. It's the same successful formula,dealing from strength, that we're applying to our othernegotiations with the Soviet Union as well.''   ``I can assure you if we don't get what we want in these otherareas, if we don't get good treaties, there will be no treaties,''he said.   ``Now that the treaty is moving to floor debate in the Senate,let the debate be vigorous and full,'' the president said. ``Andlet it proceed without delay. For I'm confident that the final votewill indeed give advice and consent to this historic treaty.''</TEXT></DOC>
