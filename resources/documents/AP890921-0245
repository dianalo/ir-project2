In its final look at overall economic activity in the spring, theCommerce Department said growth in the gross national product was0.2 percentage point lower than it estimated a month ago   The small downward revision did nothing to change the view thatthe economy was performing remarkably well during the spring,bolstered by a rebound in consumer spending, strong businessinvestment and continued double-digit growth in U.S. exports.   Many economists believe that growth will slow during the secondhalf of the year. However, the momentum provided by the secondquarter has erased fears that the country was in danger of topplinginto a recession.   The GNP revision also bore good news for the Federal ReserveBoard's goal of restraining inflation. A price index tied to the GNProse at an annual rate of 5 percent from April through June, a bitlower than the estimate a month ago.   The overall growth rate of 2.5 percent represented a modestdownward revision from a 2.7 percent rate estimated a month ago.However, both estimates were well above the inital governmentprojection, which had put GNP growth at an anemic 1.7 percent ratein the second quarter.   Before the first GNP estimate was revised, there was widespreadconcern that a year-long effort by the Fed to dampen inflationarypressures was going to push the country into a recession.   The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services andits braodest measure of economic health.   In a companion report, the government said after-tax profits ofU.S. corporations fell 7.2 percent in the second quarter, an evenbigger drop than the 5.4 percent drop in after-tax profit estimateda month ago.   The Fed reported on Wednesday the economy started the second halfof the year with its growth mixed, ranging from slow to modest fromregion to region. Other recent government reports also indicate moresluggish growth in the months ahead.   ``I basically see us muddling along'' without falling into arecession, said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial eocnomist forKleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago.   ``There'll be a little weakness here, a little there, but nothingreally to collapse us one way or the other,'' he said.   Nevertheless, the peacetime record of economic expansion appearslikely to reach its seventh year in November.   On an annual basis, the economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual rateduring the first six months of the year. The administration ispredicting GNP growth of 2.9 percent for all of 1989.   In contrast to past overly optimistic economic forecasts by theReagan administration, the Bush outlook is generally viewed as wellwithin grasp. Indeed, the GNP will only need to expand at an annualrate of 2.3 percent in the second half to reach that goal.Thereasons for the modest revision in the second quarter GNP wereslightly smaller levels of government and consumer spending thanestimated a month ago.   But even with the revisions, consumer spending, which accountsfor two-thirds of all economic activity, rose at a solid annual rateof 1.9 percent.   Other areas of strength came from a big 8.6 percent increase inbusiness spending on investment and a 13.1 percent rise in Americanexports, the third consecutive quarter in which exports have climbedat a doublel-digit rate.   The various changes left the GNP expanding in the second quarterat a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.13 trillion.   In its report Wednesday, the Fed said inflation continued to easeover much of the nation as the third quarter got undeway, indicatingthe central bank continues to attain its goal of easing inflationarypressures without slowing the economy so much that it is driven intoa recession.   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that consumer inflationwas running at a 4.8 percent annual rate, compared to 4.4 percentfor all of last year.   Most of the newfound strength in the August GNP revision came inconsumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economicactivity. Government spending, business investment and U.S. exportsales also provided momentum during the spring.   But during the summer, consumer spending tapered off except forautomobiles. Analysts believe auto sales, which had been driven byincentives and fears of steep increases in 1990-model prices, willslacken in coming months.   Exports, which also grew strongly during the first half of 1988,are expected to slow because the rising value of the dollar ismaking U.S. goods more expensive overseas.   ``Capital spending, after being a shining star during the firsthalf of the year, should ease back a bit,'' Kahan said. ``In termsof government spending, it's likely to chug along. The housingmarket should show a bit more life down the road, but not a lot.''</TEXT></DOC>
