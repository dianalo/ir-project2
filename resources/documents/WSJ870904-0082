From 1979 to 1986, the percentage of women working full time as lawyers increased to 15.2% from 10.4%. Among computer systems analysts, the percentage increased to 29.7% from 20.4%, and among electrical and electronic engineers, it increased to 9.4% from 4.4%. The data come from the 1987 Current Population Survey and the 1980 census of population.    Female lawyers earned 63% of what their male counterparts did in 1986, according to the study, compared with 55% of men's salaries in 1979. Among computer systems analysts, women's earnings rose to 83% from 79% of men's earnings. Census officials said such earnings gaps can be attributed in part to differences in experience level and length of service.    But the bureau found that most men and women work in occupations that remain largely segregated by sex. Women accounted for only 1.9% of civil engineers in 1986, for instance, but 99.2% of all secretaries.    &quot;Working in an occupation that has a high proportion of women has a negative effect on earnings,&quot; the bureau said in a separate report on a 1984 survey of the work experiences of adults in 20,000 households. &quot;Among female college graduates, for example, a 1% increase in the proportion of females in their occupation reduces earnings by 0.42%.&quot;    The survey found, moreover, that although women workers were more likely to have interruptions in their work lives, and tended to have less time in their current jobs than males, pay differences exist even between male and female workers with no break in employment and with similar experience levels.    Among people with no work interruptions, the study said, women averaged $7.44 an hour in 1984, or 69% of the $10.76 hourly wage for men -- about the same as the ratio of earnings of all female workers to those of all male workers.    Enrique Lamas, an analyst with the bureau's poverty and wealth statistics branch, said the finding indicates that &quot;a large part of the differential (between male and female full-time workers) is due to being in different occupations.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
