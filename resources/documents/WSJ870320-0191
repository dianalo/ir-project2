Wall Street Pros---By Bryan Burrough</HL><DD> 03/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Alan gaines knows he's the type of Wall Streeter that chief executive officers love to hate. He's the fast-talking head of an investment firm, lives in a Park Avenue townhouse, drives a Rolls-Royce and earns more than $1 million a year.    He also doesn't hesitate to tell America's CEOs how to do their jobs.    Two years ago, the youthful Mr. Gaines flew to Houston to tell Tenneco Inc.'s silver-haired chief executive, 56-year-old James Ketelson, to restructure the $15 billion oil conglomerate or risk a takeover.    &quot;I walk into his office in Houston and Ketelson is like Mr. WASP, Mr. Proper. And here I am, a 32-year-old kid making more money than he does, telling him how to run his company. What would your reaction be?&quot;    Neither Mr. Ketelson nor Tenneco will comment, but Mr. Gaines says the advice was spurned. Not that he was surprised. He's used to what he calls the &quot;anti-investment banker, anti-New York, anti-little rich kid&quot; attitude of big-company executives.    He in turn sometimes holds a disdainful view of Main Street.&quot;You go out to visit these CEOs who talk very slow, very deliberate. 'Well, sir-r-r, we're ve-ry interested in long-term valuuuue,'&quot; mimics Mr. Gaines, the head of Gaines Berland Co. &quot;I want to say, 'Come on, guy, spit it out. Talk. I want to get home by next year.'&quot;    Main Street and Wall Street have always been miles apart. But the takeover fever of recent years, which has thrown together conservative corporate executives and a new breed of young, highly paid raiders and investment bankers, is driving the two cultures still further apart. The result is a symbiotic relationship often marked by deep clashes in everything from how they make deals and what they wear when making them, to how they spend their money.    &quot;We have created a monster,&quot; declares Fred Zuckerman, Chrysler Corp.'s treasurer. &quot;Main Street management believes that greed has finally won out. Executives hate the takeover folks, whom they view as having no useful purpose. They think even less of the investment bankers. It's genuine revulsion at a society that rewards people so greatly for work they perceive to be so unproductive.&quot;    The recent headline-grabbing spate of insider trading scandals only has widened the chasm. &quot;There is a definite tension between corporate types and Wall Streeters,&quot; says Jonathan Rinehart, whose New York-based public relations consulting firm specializes in takeover-style crises, &quot;and all this insider trading stuff is just dumping gasoline on the fire.&quot;    A recent example is the lawsuit by Staley Continental Inc., a food company, alleging that the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. tried to pressure Staley management into a leveraged buyout. Drexel has called the allegation &quot;totally without merit&quot; and said the suit is &quot;an ill-conceived attempt to capitalize on the current climate&quot; created by the spate of insider-trading arrests.    These days even investment bankers fear Wall Street's young Frankensteins. &quot;I find the whipper-snapper investment banker who's fresh from Harvard Business School and who's going to tell you how to run your company, just as tiresome as any other CEO,&quot; says Robert S Pirie, president and chief executive of Rothschild Inc. &quot;These smart-aleck kids who have gotten bagged (for insider-trading violations) ought to go to jail for more than a year,&quot; he says. &quot;Minus their toenails.&quot;    Along Main Street, here's how David Culver, 51-year-old former CEO of Amarillo, Texas-based Pioneer Corp., views Wall Street types:    &quot;I'm sick of 'em all,&quot; he says. Mr. Culver developed his hostility last year when he sold out to crosstown buddy T. Boone Pickens after being overwhelmed by a phalanx of raiders and investment bankers.    Mr. Culver complains that in boardroom jousts his Wall Street opponents were so single-minded as to appear &quot;programmed.&quot;    &quot;First of all, they're not a damn bit smarter than me, no matter what they think,&quot; says Mr. Culver. Even more disturbing to him, the Wall Streeters seem concerned with little beyond money and their careers. &quot;Our guys are much more family-oriented. They look forward to going home and playing with their children,&quot; Mr. Culver says.    &quot;I was president of the Amarillo Club, in the United Way and Rotary,&quot; he continues. &quot;We consider that important. When the Wall Streeter finally gets home, he's lucky to see his family, much less go down to the United Way and make calls.&quot;    It's still unclear where all the resentment will lead. But it could trigger a grassroots backlash of the type that toppled another generation of financiers: the robber barons. Politicians are already on the scent. &quot;If you did to a 7-Eleven what (Wall Streeters) have done to the American economy, you'd be doing 20-to-life,&quot; said James Hightower, outspoken Texas agriculture commissioner, in a recent speech before national Democratic leaders.    Much of this boils down to simple difference in executive style. To the typical Main Street executive, Wall Streeters are fresh-faced MBAs in tailored suits and mallard-dotted suspenders who come to places like Bartlesville, Okla., and Akron, Ohio, only to put people out of work -- all the while mouthing terms like &quot;break-up values&quot; and &quot;front-end loaded, two-tier tender offers.&quot;    In turn, many Wall Streeters seem to view their Main Street counterparts as slow-moving, boorish hicks. &quot;The so-called sophisticates tend to be surprised when they find smart guys out there in the hinterlands,&quot; says Gary Hirsch, a 37-year-old principal in the New York investment firm of Miller, Tabak andamp; Hirsch. &quot;They'll walk out of meetings and say, 'Gee, even though this guy is from Pennsylvania, he knows what he's doing.'&quot;    Still, when Wall Streeters venture down Main Street, sometimes they feel like they're in a foreign country. During the unsuccessful visit to Tenneco's chief executive, Mr. Gaines found himself lunching &quot;at some place with animal heads on the walls. It was like eating in the Baptist Club of Houston. I expected to have to say grace before sitting down. I mean, in New York I take people to Le Cirque,&quot; he says, referring to the famed French restaurant.    The difference in lunch style, though, often pales before the difference in lifestyle. Case in point is last November's visit by Robert E. Mercer, Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co.'s 62-year-old chief executive, to the Manhattan townhouse of Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French investor who then was trying to grab the Akron-based tiremaker.    According to a Goodyear associate, Mr. Mercer was taken aback when he knocked at what he thought was the correct address, only to be told by a smartly dressed butler that Sir James lived several doors down. Knocking there, the same butler opened the door, explaining to Mr. Mercer: &quot;This is Mr. Goldsmith's home. That was the kitchen.&quot;    Once inside, the father of five found himself facing two statues of nude females and a myriad of paintings of nudes. Mr. Mercer, an associate says, hasn't yet tired of relating his amazement.    But it is in the boardroom where matters of style matter most. Nowhere was that more apparent than at Phillips Petroleum Co. in 1984, when Wall Street specialists arrived to help the Bartlesville oil company fend off a Who's Who of corporate raiders.    Phillips CEO William Douce and other officials occasionally would roll their eyes after lecture-like presentations by the investment bankers. Says Mr. Douce, now retired: &quot;I don't mind those young people making a lot of money in a short time. But some of 'em speak as if they were God. Some of 'em think they may be God. I'll tell you a secret. Most of those fellows come in, listen to you and your people. Then they take your own ideas, dress 'em up a little and read 'em back to you.&quot;    Down in the Phillips public relations department, employees were equally put off by the New York firm hired by senior executives hired to manage the company's media campaign. Although a Phillips spokesman denies it, a person close to the company says the two sides fought over practically every word of every press release, at times to the brink of fistfights.    &quot;There was the perception that the New Yorkers thought they had come down here to help the Great Unwashed,&quot; says a Phillips official. &quot;Just because we don't eat at Tavern on the Green doesn't make us any less sophisticated.&quot;    When the culture clash between adversaries surfaces, it is enough to bring a heated takeover battle to a boil. That apparently was the case when, during Pennzoil Co.'s unsuccessful bid to acquire Getty Oil Co., Pennzoil's tough-talking chief executive, J. Hugh Liedtke, was host to Jay Higgins, then a 38-year-old Salomon Brothers investment banker who represented the Getty Museum, a major Getty Oil shareholder.    Mr. Liedtke asked several anxious questions about the museum's position on the pending merger, but Mr. Higgins kept silent, Pennzoil lawyer Arthur Liman recalled in recent court testimony. Suddenly, Mr. Higgins answered all at once: &quot;Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. No, sir.&quot;    Mr. Liman, seeing his boss near explosion, quickly escorted the investment banker from the room. &quot;Mr. Higgins did a number on Mr. Liedtke . . . a mocking of him. I just wanted to get him out of there,&quot; Mr. Liman testified.    Mr. Higgins, currently head of corporate finance at Salomon, denies mocking Mr. Liedtke. He says he wasn't entirely responsive to the executive because, at the time, he didn't want to divulge to Pennzoil the Getty Museum's position. (Getty Oil was bought by Texaco, a deal that could be undone by a so-far successful lawsuit by Pennzoil.)    But sometimes Wall Streeters know just how they come across.    The most offensive ones relish it. Others suggest that stereotypes, used craftily, can be turned to one's advantage. Confronting a potentially hostile Midwestern crowd, Daniel Scotto, a utility-bond analyst at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, may opt for the Wall Street equivalent of full-body armor.    Outside New York, he says, &quot;If I think I need an extra edge, you will find me in full garb -- my Brooks Brothers suit, my suspenders and my yellow tie. Other places, with friends, say, I'll switch to a softer approach. The light gray suit, blue shirt and blue tie.&quot;    Main Streeters can be just as canny. A common tactic might be called &quot;the country boy ploy,&quot; a ruse some executives west of the Hudson use in an attempt to coax an opponent into underestimating them.    Before Pennzoil's court fight with Texaco over the Getty purchase, Mr. Liedtke -- one of the ploy's foremost practitioners -- portrayed himself as something of an oil-patch rube, a notable feat considering his diplomas from Amherst College and Harvard Business School. What effect the approach had on Texaco isn't known, but it certainly helped generate sympathetic media coverage for Pennzoil.    In any case, the $14 billion jury verdict in Mr. Liedtke's favor makes some Wall Streeters wary of self-proclaimed country boys. &quot;Every time someone says, 'I'm just a country boy,' I check my money, button my pockets and give my wallet to my secretary,&quot; says Rothschild's Mr. Pirie.    There are tests to help discern Wall Streeters from Main Streeters. &quot;I look for the gold Rolex,&quot; says Chrysler's Mr. Zuckerman. &quot;Wall Street is populated with gold Rolexes and summer houses in the Hamptons. They never talk long before they start on about their summer house in the Hamptons.&quot;    ---   Mr. Burrough is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Pittsburgh bureau.    ---                    A Matter of Perspective   Are chief executives of major corporations more or lessethical in their business practices today than they were 10years ago? It depends which side of the desk you're on. TheWall Street Journal asked CEOs that question in its survey onexecutive style in January; and the same question was askedin a Wall Street Journal/NBC News national poll of 1,576people on Jan. 22 and 23. The answers provide startinglydifferent views.
