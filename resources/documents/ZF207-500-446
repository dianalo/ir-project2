(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Interactive Graphics Software Gains Ease, Sophistication and AccessibilityandM;BUYER'S TIPSandM;1 Look for the graphics software that best matches the abilities of the userswho will employ it.andM;2 If one graphics package is needed for sophisticated users as well asnovices, look for software with both menu- and command-driven user interfacesas well as &quot;preformatted&quot; graph options.andM;3 If you anticipate needing windowing capabilities in the near future, askvendors if DECwindows or X windows are in their product development plans.andM;4 Make sure the software supports your input devices--some packagesaccommodate mice, for instance.andM;5 Although it is economical to look for software that supports your currentoutput devices, you may need to upgrade to printers or plotters that producethe type or quality of graphics hard copy that users want.andM;Interactive graphics software has revolutionized how business people,scientists and technical researchers analyze and present information.andO;Graphics have become the focal point of professional meetings, seminars andconferences; many computer users wouldn't dare present data without them.andM;Digital Review defines interactive graphics software as a stand-alone packagethat lets users enter data, either interactively or via a file, and depictthe data as one or more kinds of charts or graphs with varying degrees ofembellishment.andP;  No programming is involved.andM;These products help users portray complex information in a readily accessibleformat, simplifying problem-solving and elegantly translating numeric datainto images that indicate trends or the crux of a business decision.andM;Carl Machover, president of Machover Associates, a graphics consultingcompany in White Plains, N.Y., said that interactive graphics software is oneof the fastest-growing areas in the entire graphics market, with a 15 to 20percent annual growth rate.andM;Part of the reason for the growth is that DEC-compatible graphics packages,like their PC counterparts, are becoming easier to use, thanks to theintroduction of increasingly simple and accessible user interfaces.andP;  Inaddition, interactive graphics buyers tend to be satisfied customers.andO;Vendors claim that user requests often fuel new product developments.andO;Perhaps here more than in other software markets, user feedback helps shapehow the software looks and functions.andM;Many interactive graphics packages now also support DECwindows or X windows.andO;The utilities allow users with DECwindows-compatible display devices tocreate and view graphics while accessing other applications.andM;Despite the introduction of many new features, prices for graphics softwareremain fairly stable.andP;  It's a compatitive market, and vendors are battlingone another with innovative features rather than slashed prices.andP;  Whethershopping for the computer-shy or for computerphiles, interactive graphicssoftware buyers will find good pickings.andM;EASIER, MORE SOPHISTICATEDandM;Product enhancements during the past year have primarily made graphicssoftware easier to use.andP;  Because many business and scientific users areunfamiliar with computer software or simply can't spend time learning acomplicated user interface, vendors have obliged by adding pop-up menus,graphics &quot;scripts&quot; that prompt users in fill-in-the-blank fashion, and awider selection of preformatted chart options.andM;Mike Wakshull, Procyon Computer System's president, said most &quot;users want toturn on their [graphics] machine, do their work and be done with it.andP;  Theydon't have a lot of time to learn a complex product.&quot;andM;By providing command-driven interfaces, many graphics packages alsoaccommodate technically adept computer users who want to bypass menus andaccess advanced functions more quickly and efficiently.andM;Although most interactive graphics packages are designed to run on a VAX hostand to be accessed from graphics terminals, many vendors said their softwareis also being written to run on DEC and DEC-compatible workstations.andP;  &quot;Mostvendors have their products in the conversion stage,&quot; Wakshull said.andM;Such packages can take advantage of workstations' significantly higher screenresolutions and faster processing speeds.andP;  &quot;Workstation [graphics packages]are faster because [the user is] directly interfacing with a computer ratherthan dealing with a host communications line,&quot; Wakshull explained.andP;  Manyvendors noted that workstation-oriented interactive graphics packages areproving particularly popular in scientific settings.andM;According to David Prawel, Precision Visuals' marketing manager foranalytical products, scientists and technical researchers are as likely asbusiness people to be busy just staying abreast of developments in their ownfields.andP;  Rather than aspiring to become adept graphics programmers, theysimply want accessible but powerful graphics tools.andM;Even though interactive graphics software capabilities keep improving, priceshave remained stable.andP;  Vendors are sinking money into product enhancementsrather than dropping prices to compete in what they characterize as a tightmarket.andP;  That bodes well for buyers, of course, who keep getting more for thesame money.andM;At least one graphics vendor has instituted a new pricing policy to helpbuyers pay less per user without actually dropping prices.andP;  Procyon recentlychanged its pricing structure so that Star*Draw and Star*Show softwarelicenses are based on the number of users accessing the packages, not thesize of a sitehs hardware.andM;&quot;It's possible to have only one user on a VAX 8800, even if it potentiallyhas hundreds of users,&quot; said Procyon's Wakshull.andP;  &quot;We have the same price fora MicroVAX user and a [VAX]cluster user.andP;  This does not penalize someonebecause they bought a large system.&quot; Star*Draw and Star*Show each range from$4,995 for a single-user to $24,995 for a 10-user license.andM;Procyon also offers unlimited-user licenses.andP;  Based on the type of host, theprices start at $7,995 for a MicroVAX 2000 and peak at $23,995 for a VAX8800.andM;GRAPHICS FOR THE MASSESandM;According to vendors, more interactive graphics products are being designedto address general-purpose business and scientific graphics needs.andP;  &quot;Graphicsis no longer high-tech,&quot; said Rick Kreysar, Computer AssociatesInternational's vice president of marketing.andP;  &quot;It's more of a commodity, likespreadsheets.andP;  The jot [of interactive graphics software vendors] is to pushgraphics to the masses.&quot;andM;To accomplish that goal, many vendors are working to provide simple butpowerful user interfaces.andP;  For that reason, many graphics pacages now providemenus for users who prefer them.andM;Computer Associates International, for instance, recently added pop-up menusto CA-Tellagraf, a previously command-driven product.andP;  &quot;This allows[CA-Tellagraf] to be as easy to use as PC [graphics software],&quot; Kreysar said.andM;The trend toward PC-like menus is important, he said, because many userslearn to use PC graphics tools before they encounter a VAX graphics package.andO;Once accustomed to PC functions such as pop-up menus, he explained, userscome to expect such functions on a VAX.andM;In addition to offering a menu-driven interface, Procyon's Star*Draw can alsobe mouse-driven when run on a terminal or workstation that supports mice.andO;&quot;[A mouse] involves less typing,&quot; Procyon's Wakshull said.andP;  &quot;[Users can] lookonly at the screen, rather than the keyboard.&quot;andM;Several products also offer selections of preformatted charts and graphs.andO;For example, CA-Tellagraf provides more than 1,300 &quot;chart stencils.&quot;andO;Computer Associates International's Kreysar said CA-Tellagraf users who have&quot;a fear of graphics&quot; can select a graph or chart type from the stencilcatalog, then respond to a series of simple prompts that help them designtheir final graphics representations.andP;  CA-Tellagraf also provides defaultcolor settings, title and legend positions and the like.andP;  The defaultsettings can be modified at any time by more intrepid users.andM;Similarly, Multiware's Prep software provides default graphics &quot;scripts.&quot;andO;Beginner-level Prep users select the type of pie chart, bar chart or linegraph--the &quot;script&quot;--desired, explained Bob Walraven, Multiware's chiefexecutive officer, &quot;but as they become more sophisticated, they write theirown scripts.&quot;andM;Walraven noted that many PC graphics packages offer &quot;canned graphs&quot; thatusers can't modify.andP;  &quot;If you don't like the canned graph, there's not muchyou can do with it,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We give a canned graph, plus instructions onmodifying it, and the flexibility to do so.&quot;andM;Ease-of-use applies to printing graphics as well.andP;  When buyers select agraphics package, vendors advised, they should be sure that the softwaresupports their page printers and/or pen plotters--along with any outputdevices they plan to purchase in the near future.andM;Procyon's Wakshull noted that most packages are compatible with a wide rangeof hard-copy output devices.andP;  &quot;Because there are so many devices, from amarketing perspective [vendors] have to be able to support them,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;Most [buyers] are looking for software to drive existing hardware.&quot;andO;Wakshull added that graphics packages should allow users to send files &quot;to awhole host of different output devices and get [virtually] the same outputregardless.&quot;andM;POPULARITY OF WINDOWSandM;A year ago, business graphics vendors interested in providing windowingsupport were uncertain whether to offer DECwindows or X windows.andP;  Currently,two packages support the X protocol and three support DECwindows.andP;  But aswindows fever has caught on among interactive graphics users, many vendorssaid they plan to opt for DECwindows.andM;Vendors expressed various reasons for preferring DECwindows.andP;  Walraven ofMultiware, whose Prep software will soon support DECwindows, said DECwindowsprovides a simpler user interface than X windows.andP;  And Procyon's Wakshullsaid his company prefers DECwindows because it is written in Fortran,granting users &quot;the capability to go from any compiler language to hook intothe window system.&quot;andM;Does every business graphics software user need windows?andP;  That depends on thecomplexity of the information and the number of applications supplyinggraphics data, vendors and market analysts said.andP;  Users who want to pull datafrom statistical software, a spreadsheet, a database and perhaps anaccounting package would benefit from being able to access each of thoseapplications--as well as their graphics packages--simultaneously via multiplewindows.andM;Don't expect windowing capabilities to become standard graphics features,however.andP;  According to Machover Associates' Machover, many users have juggledvarious applications without the aid, of windows for years and may considerwindowing capabilities unnecessary.andP;  &quot;If [users] have been involved ingraphics for five or six years, windowing is less of a major factor forthem,&quot; he said.andM;GRAPHICS FOR SPECIFIC USESandM;In addition to being sold as stand-alone software, many graphics packages areavailable along with an entire office automation system.andP;  The other packagesoften include word processors, spreadsheets, calendar management tools anddatabases.andM;Stone Mountain Computing's Graphic Outlook, for instance, ties interactiongraphics into an office environment by supporting Stone Mountain'sspreadsheet and by providing interfaces to other vendors' applications.andO;Graphic Outlok is also fully integrated with DEC's All-in-1 office automationsystem.andM;Saturn Systems' Saturn-Graph is also available as part of Saturn's officeautomation system.andP;  Saturn-Graph can be integrated with the Saturn-Calcspreadsheet, the Saturn-WP word processor and the Saturn-Base relationaldatabase.andM;In addition, some graphics packages are intended to complement specificapplication needs.andP;  For example, V.I.'s DV-Draw is designed for displayingreal-time inforamtion--data that changes over time.andP;  According to CarlKowalski, V.I.'s vice president of sales and marketing, the software canincorporate continuously inputted data into screen displays that use color tohighlight changes.andM;DV-Draw users define data sources--files, programs that sequentially feeddata, memory data sources or function data sources--which are then linked toa dynamic on-screen object that changes based on dat avariations, Kowalskisaid.andP;  For instance, all or part of an image's color can change to reflectchanges above or below a given threshold.andM;Dynamically portraying real-time data is unique in the DEC business graphicsenvironment, Kowalski said, where most presentation graphics packages simplyoffer snapshots of static information.andM;Kowalski said that DV-Draw is often chosen to help monitor physicalenvironments, such as changing pipe temperatures at a chemical plant.andP;  Henoted that the software is used in both laboratory and factory settings.andM;Kowalski conceded that DV-Draw's basic user interface is more complicatedthan those found in most business graphics packages.andP;  &quot;The function datasource mimics programming,&quot; Kowalski said.andP;  &quot;It does require an understandingof syntax, but simple syntax.&quot;andP;  The software includes a menu-driven editor,however, and lets users choose from a library of 44 predefined graph formats.andM;DV-Draw is targeted toward technically adept government, aerospace andengineering users, who may have the expertise required to handle programmablegraphics packages but don't necessarily have time to do so.andP;  &quot;The bulk of[DV-Draw] users are using it in an environment where it goes along withprogramming,&quot; Kowalski said.andP;  &quot;[DV-Draw] can be used for quite a bit ofdevelopment without even getting into programming.andP;  [Our users] aren't lesstechnical but are stretched to the point where they donht have time for[programming] graphics.&quot;andM;BUSINESS GRAPHICS USE ON RISEandM;This year, U.S.andP;  graphics software vendors sold $11.2 billion worth ofcomputer graphics products worldwide, according to Machover Associates'Machover.andP;  The bulk of that graphics market, he said, is currently splitbetween CAD/CAM and interactive business graphics packages.andP;  According toMachover, CAD/CAM packages, with 53 percent, will have the greater marketshare this year, while business graphics packages are expected to account for35 percent of the market.andM;But by 1994, Machover predicts, business graphics packages will dominate thegraphics scene.andP;  &quot;The CAD/CAM market is saturated,&quot; he said, &quot;while potentialbusiness users have not been tapped.andP;  Business graphics is growing at afaster rate.&quot;andM;For interactive graphics buyers, this is more good news.andP;  More importantstill, however, is the prospect that the products will increasingly let usersexchange files between different applications--including graphicstools--running on a variety of hosts.andM;&quot;The proprietary world is disappearing,&quot; said Richard Davis, executive vicepresident of Applix.andP;  The Westboro, Mass.-based company manufactures Alis, anintegrated office automation system that includes a graphics editor.andO;&quot;Customers now want open systems,&quot; he said.andM;Product integration via open systems is already well under way for somegraphics products.andP;  &quot;Our ability to integrate with other prodcts, such ascode generators and databases, is key to our success,&quot; V.I.'s Kowalski said,explaining that open system architectures allow users to define their owninterfaces, to other systems.andM;As hardware developments emerge, such as new display screen technologies andinput devices (voice input mechanisms, for example), interactive graphicssoftware vendors said they will move quickly to take full advantage of thenew capabilities.andM;&quot;We're watching all these elements to make sure we provide compatibility,&quot;Applix's Davis said.andM;He noted that &quot;as new hardware evolves, there is a need for morestandardization.andP;  [Graphics software] users don't want to learn somethingnew.andP;  They want to carry on what they're already doing.&quot;andM;Graphics software vendors continue to paint a bright picture for interactivegraphics software.andP;  By widening the variety of graphics capabilities as wellas the breadth of the software's audience, vendors are ensuring a healthyfuture for themselves and, more important, they are supplying tools that areefficient, capable and always close to the cutting edge.andM;3-D Or Not To 3-DandM;Many interactive graphics packages are beginning to offer what is calledthree-dimensional graphics.andP;  The term tends to confuse buyers, many of whomaren't sure whether or not they need the feature, or even what it means.andO;Further complicating the issue are &quot;pseudo 3-D&quot; applications, whose &quot;shadow&quot;lines add the appearance of depth but may make data more difficult to read.andM;In reality, all graphic images are, of course, two-dimensional.andO;Three-dimensional images simply create the illusion of depth.andP;  Pseudo 3-Dpackages accomplish this by adding shadows--lines extended to one side--tothe bars and pies in charts.andP;  True 3-D graphics packages, in contrast, usemore sophisticated shading techniques to create a better 3-D illusion.andM;Bob Walraven, chief executive officer at Multiware, said pseudo 3-D graphicsconfuse rather than help visual presentations, merely adding visual&quot;clutter.&quot;andP;  When data is presented in pseudo 3-D mode, he said, theadditional shadow lines obscure the actual data.andP;  Walraven said pseudo 3-Dtends to impede the clear portrayal of information and could easily lead tomisinterpretation of data.andM;Despite being &quot;philosophically&quot; opposed to pseudo 3-D, Walraven saidMultiware's Prep software will include the feature in an upcoming release,due to heavy customer demand.andP;  Through a series of newsletter articles,Multiware will try to educate users about the pitfalls of pseudo 3-D.andP;  Thepackage will also offer true 3-D surface capabilities, Walraven said.andM;Carl Machover, president of the White Plains, N.Y., graphics consultingcompany Machover Associates, considers true 3-D useful for business usersbecause it allows them to group different &quot;universes of data&quot; in one chart.andO;&quot;It shows data as a surface instead of a simple curve,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It is assimple a way as possible to compare information.&quot;andM;Machover cautioned that interpreting true 3-D material is an acquired skill.andO;&quot;Once you learn to use it, it can be very useful, but the first time youencounter it, it can [appear] cluttered,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It's a productivitytool.andP;  You have to learn how to use it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
