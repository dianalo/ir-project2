(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sometimes it takes a little nipper to catcha big fish.   Armed with her telescoping Fisher-Price rod clamped to herlittle tackle box, 28-inch-long Katie Miller nabbed a 27-inchwalleye.   OK, she had plenty of help from her dad, Richard W. Miller. Butthe fact is that little rod, the one with the black plastic reel,hauled in this big 7-pound walleye to give 20-month-old Katie asuccessful Fishing Opener Weekend.   Katie's mom, Anita, says the family was fishing Sunday night onthe dock of their Island Lake home. Katie held the rod after herfather cast into the water.   ``My husband saw her line going out, and he said, `Oh, she's gota fish!''' Mrs. Miller recalled.   ``We got it in by the dock, and there was this great big swirlin the water. My husband said, `Get the net!' Of course, we didn'thave a net there. So, he got it under the gills and pulled it in.I'd never seen a fish that big.''   Katie, who had become a spectator for most of this operation,evidently was pleased with her fish.   ``She liked it,'' her mother said. ``She touched it.''   Katie's father had promised all along that he would have herfirst fish mounted. He was planning on something a little smaller.   ``It's going to cost us $141 to mount this fish!''

Where can diners walk through the bar into the kitchen, down asteep flight of steps to the basement and through a narrow hallwayto a small room for the privilege of paying a minimum of $350 perperson for dinner?   At the 21 Club.   The club's famed secret wine cellar, where Prohibition guestsdowned drinks behind the protection of a 4,000-pound secret door,opened Monday night as a sanctuary for well-heeled diners.   Inside, a single table set with sparkling silver and a floralcenterpiece sat amid floor-to-ceiling racks of wine bottles and awooden booth where high-living Mayor Jimmy Walker used to knockback a few in the 1920s.   But intimacy, nostalgia and a six-course supper don't come cheapin the midtown Manhattan restaurant's one-table sanctum that canaccommodate up to 12 gourmets.   ``Prices start for dinner at $350 a head, and that includes aselection of wines we would recommend,'' said Ken Aretsky, chairmanof the 21 Club.   Fifty-five years ago, the recess was hidden by pipes and hams,Aretsky said.   A tap on the wall indicates nothing unusual. But when chiefsommelier Matt Siegel sticks a long, slender steel rod into a tinyhole _ Voila! _ the secret 4,000-pound brick door opens.   During Prohibition, federal agents once searched 10 hours forthe secret door, Siegel said.   ``They knocked on the walls and lit matches to find a draft,''but never found it, he said proudly.</TEXT></DOC>
