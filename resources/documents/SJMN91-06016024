It's evolved over time.&quot;;    After fielding questions from thecouncil, Wilson, other city staff members and private design consultants movedthree hours later to an even more confused group, the public. At a town hallmeeting at the Civic Auditorium, they tried again to explain recovery effortsto about 150 local residents.;    Although much of downtown Santa Cruz remainsin ruins, thousands of hours in strategy meetings, architectural work,financial wrangling and permit reviews have been completed. Plans for 11individual buildings and a new parking structure have been approved by thecity council.;    What confuses many local residents, however, is the processthat is supposed to tie everything together.;    The two private design firmsand several public task forces that have been working on sweeping master planssince the Loma Prieta quake comprise a tangled litany of acronyms: ROMA, TAG,WRT, VSC.;    San Francisco-based ROMA Design Group was hired as the principalconsultant and charged with drawing up the overall recovery blueprint. Thatdocument, which will cost the city about $160,000, is slated to be finished byJune.;    During the last several months, ROMA has been receiving input fromfour other groups: the city's streetscape committee; the streetscape designfirm of Wallace, Roberts and Todd; Vision Santa Cruz, a public advisory body;and TAG, a Technical Advisory Group of city staff and merchants.;    Alsoinvolved in the process is the Downtown Commission, which is conducting aparking study, and the public works department, charged with assessing andfixing damage to municipal service structures such as storm drains and waterpipes.;    Until Tuesday's meeting, few council members had more than apassing understanding of exactly what all the groups did or how theyinteracted.;    Three of the seven council members -- Kennedy, Neal Coonertyand Louis Rittenhouse -- were first elected two months ago without any priorexperience in elected office. Of the remaining four, only Councilman JohnMahaney had served on the board for more than three years.;    Mayor JaneYokoyama admitted the recovery framework was hard to understand, but saidprevious city leaders &quot;took an honest stab at it&quot; during extremely tryingtimes. They also wanted to ensure widespread public participation in layingout the new downtown, she said.;    Some leaders, including Coonerty, joinedKennedy in suggesting that several of the downtown advisory groups hadfulfilled their missions and could be phased out in the coming months.;    &quot;Atsome point we have to bring it back to a more normal use of our cityresources,&quot; Coonerty said.;    During the two-hour session, CouncilwomanKatherine Beiers also requested that all the advisory groups begin keepingminutes of their weekly meetings.;    Sounding an ominous tone, Councilman DonLane warned that it was in the council's interest to learn everything it couldabout the rebuilding process.;    &quot;We're going to get the credit or the blameno matter what happens,&quot; Lane said. &quot;We have to make sure we're taking everybit of responsibility for the end result.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL ROGERS, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910116  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  618  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 16, 199100016024,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
