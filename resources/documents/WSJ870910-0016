The order by U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe late yesterday came as the result of a lawsuit BMW brought against the U.S. unit of Austin Rover Group Ltd. of Britain, which is responsible for the ad. Sterling, which was introduced in the U.S. this year, is a joint venture of Austin Rover and Honda Motor Co. of Japan.    Montvale, N.J.-based BMW is the U.S. sales arm of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG of West Germany.    In its suit, BMW charged the Sterling ad that highlights the car's standard security system claims falsely that most BMWs and other luxury cars don't have such systems. The ad shows a luxury car being vandalized.    Judge Lowe, after watching the ad in court, said most people would recognize the vandalized car as being a BMW and would get the impression they &quot;are fair game to be ripped off.&quot; She ordered pretrial preparations to begin and scheduled a hearing for Sept. 28 for a possible preliminary injunction against the ads. </TEXT></DOC>
