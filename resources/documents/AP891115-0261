Both Warner and David Schiebel have been free on bond appealingtheir March 1987 convictions.   The collapse of Cincinnanti-based Home State in 1985 triggeredOhio's savings and loan crises of that year.   A three-judge panel of the 1st Ohio District Court of Appealsalso threw out a lower court's order that Warner pay $22 million inrestitution to Ohio and $250,000 in prosecution costs, and thatSchiebel pay $25,000 in prosecution costs.   The appeals court said the cost and restitution penalties werebased on a statement of fees submitted by the state that had notbeen certified as correct and legal by either the prosecutor or theclerk of the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court.   Warner and Schiebel were convicted after a four-month trial inCincinnati.   The jury convicted Warner of six charges that he oversawunauthorized transfers of Home State money to a major securitiestrading partner, ESM Government Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale,Fla.   Home State collapsed on March 8, 1985, four days after ESM wasshut down by federal regulators for insolvency. Home State hadinvested heavily with ESM through securities trades and lost $144million when ESM closed.   The jury also convicted Warner of three counts that he committedsecurities violations by failing to give a true picture of HomeState's financial status in circulars advertising the 1984 sale ofHome State bonds.   Warner was sentenced to 3{ years in prison.   Warner, a millionaire businessman and former U.S. ambassador toSwitzerland during the Carter administration, was cleared by a U.S.District Court jury in Ann Arbor, Mich., of fraud and conspiracycharges in the failure of Home State.   Home State's collapse caused a crisis for 69 other privatelyinsured Ohio savings and loans institutions whose deposits wereinsured by the same agency. Gov. Richard Celeste temporarily closedthe thrifts and ordered them to obtain federal deposit insurance ormerge with companies that had it before reopening.   Home State later was sold and reopened in June 1985 under newownership.</TEXT></DOC>
