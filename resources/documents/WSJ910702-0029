Now its persistence is starting to pay off.   NEC is at the cutting edge of supercomputer technology.But it hasn't been able to make much headway in the marketbecause of resistance from federally funded research labs anduniversities, the biggest supercomputer buyers, which usuallyprefer to buy American.   Recently, though, the company's HNSX unit quietly wresteda huge sale to the Canadian Meteorological Centre -- valuedat up to $60 million -- from Cray Research, Eagan, Minn., theworld's largest supercomputer maker. The sale is expected toresult in one of the world's largest supercomputerinstallations and vastly increase the accuracy of weatherforecasting across Canada.   HNSX hasn't talked about the contract, but Canadiangovernment contract listings confirm the sale, showing thatthe weather center accepted a bid of 46.7 million Canadiandollars (US$40.1 million) by NEC. The ultimate value could bemuch higher.   The agreement marks the first time Cray has lost anexisting account; it had been at the site since 1983. Thecompany blames inadequate marketing and its own complacency.Cray is under assault by powerful Japanese supercomputers andmassively parallel computer designs, which deliver blindingcomputational speed at relatively low cost but are somewhatlimited in applications.                                                                                                          Making Traffic Reports   Available on Demand                                                                                                          SOMEDAY, perhaps, sensors in major roadways will detecttraffic jams and warn away cars equipped with computerizedmaps. For now, drivers listen to radio reports -- often aboutthe traffic jam in which they're already stuck.   SmartRoute Systems is trying to use today's technology toprovide a profit-making traffic advisory service. From itsCambridge, Mass., headquarters, SmartRoute, which beganoperating in May, monitors Boston traffic in several ways. Ithas an airplane, a fleet of commuters equipped with cellularphones, and stationary cameras on utility poles and downtownhigh-rises.   The cameras feed still images to an operations centerevery five seconds. Voice reports come in to operators whoalso monitor police scanners for news of accidents. Theinformation is typed into databases that already include newsof construction projects and other scheduled delays. Anannouncer records important changes.   Commuters can call in from car phones under a promotionwith Nynex, punch a number to request information on, say,approaches to Logan Airport, and hear whether the bridge ortunnel is worse. SmartRoute also sells booklets of mapsshowing alternative routes around trouble spots.   John Liebesny, SmartRoute's president, is targeting theproduct to businesses, at least initially, at a price of$1,000 a month plus $1 per employee. He says delivery fleets,mobile sales forces, truckers and airline crews will beanxious for such information. Early customers include GTE andHewlett-Packard facilities that offer it to employees. Mr.Liebesny eventually hopes to start a dial-in service forindividuals and says the venture, if successful, will expandto other cities.   But Norman Abend, a traffic consultant in Burlington,Mass., says traffic reports don't help much in congesteddowntowns: &quot;The Central Artery {Boston's main downtownfreeway} is plugged up every day. What's new? In downtownareas, there's such a network of roads that people divertimmediately and everything gets clogged.&quot;                                                                                                          In an Earlier Era, They Had   To Rebuild Carburetors                                                                                                          COMPUTERS have become so routine that Harvard studentsdon't have to prove they can use them anymore.   Since the late 1970s, when it established a corecurriculum for undergraduates, Harvard had required freshmento prove they could log onto a mainframe and write a simpleprogram. If students couldn't learn how to do so on theirown, they had to get tutoring until they could pass what thestudent newspaper called &quot;the widely dreaded&quot; test. Some ofthe 1,600 freshmen a year failed five or six times.   But this spring Harvard dropped the requirement. &quot;Thecomputer test was visionary for its time,&quot; says Peter T.Ellison, an anthropology professor who heads a facultysubcommittee on the requirement. &quot;Twelve years ago, using acomputer meant logging onto a mainframe and programming itsince there were very few low-level software packages. . . .Those were assumed to be basic skills.&quot;   Mr. Ellison says computers remain important tools, buttoday &quot;we can assume&quot; that students can &quot;turn on a Macintoshand call up a spreadsheet.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE SHARP Wizard pocket organizer has a new accessory, afax attachment that Sharp Electronics bills as the world'ssmallest. The pocket-sized fax can send messages to any faxmachine, but can't receive them. Sharp also has startedselling what it calls the first desktop color fax machine,priced at $31,999. . . . Counterpoint Publishing inWellesley, Mass., offers weekly editions of the FederalRegister on compact disk, making it easy for corporatelawyers and others to do computer searches of new rules bykey word without poring over every page. . . . The AmericanChemical Society warns scientists against recording lab noteson computers rather than in notebooks. Computer records areso easy to change they might not serve as evidence in patentdisputes, the group says.</TEXT></DOC>
