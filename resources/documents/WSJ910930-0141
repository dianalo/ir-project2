Heimann's Sept. 12 editorial-page article, &quot;Don'tOverregulate After BCCI,&quot; like virtually all the coverage ofthe scandal, focuses on the inefficiencies of governmentalauthorities, their duping, the fraud and themoney-laundering. It concludes, quite rightly as to theseaspects, that the lesson of BCCI for the internationalregulatory system is limited and requires no furtherlegislation beyond proposals currently pending in Congress.It fails, however, to address the incident's long-termsignificance -- its vivid demonstration of the legaluncertainties when banking organizations become insolvent.   Chief among these is a direct clash between the policiesunderlying U.S. bankruptcy laws and U.S. banking regulation.A fundamental concept of bankruptcy procedures is that onegroup of creditors should not be given preferential treatmentover other creditors similarly situated. To effectuate thispolicy the foreign representatives engaged in marshalingBCCI's assets in Luxembourg and other locales have usedspecial, ancillary proceedings in the New York bankruptcycourt to restrain U.S. creditors (including bank regulatoryauthorities) from reaching assets present in the U.S. If theysucceed, a majority of the assets could be sent overseas forthe benefit of world-wide creditors.</LP><TEXT>   However, banking law and regulation have long beenconducted on the assumption that certain banking creditorsare entitled to preferential treatment (and U.S. banks maynot file a bankruptcy proceeding). Thus, New York andCalifornia, two states in which BCCI organizations operated,provide in their relevant banking laws for the state'sbanking regulator to gather BCCI assets in the state, applythem to liabilities in the state and send any excess, shouldit exist, elsewhere. (Interestingly, California allows suchexcess to be sent in the first instance wherever else it isneeded in the U.S.; New York provides for the excess to besent directly overseas.)   Bank regulators historically have allowed foreign banks toestablish branches or agencies, relying in part on theirability to protect local interests through asset maintenancerequirements. As New York state became increasingly concernedwith BCCI's activities, it required BCCI to limit theactivities of its New York agency and to maintain assets inthe state that exceeded the amount of its third-partyliabilities. In other jurisdictions -- for a variety ofreasons -- liabilities exceed assets.   The real questions are (1) should regulatory efforts in avigilant jurisdiction inure to the benefit of thatjurisdiction's citizens and constituents or be shared withcreditors world-wide, and (2) should regulatory actions takenclose to the time of actual insolvency be allowed to confersuch benefits? Obviously, the answers to these questions areimportant to every creditor of a banking institution havingworld-wide operations. While this type of issue is not easyto answer, it does warrant a clear answer in the courts --or, if necessary, in Congress.   Deborah S. Prutzman   New York</TEXT></DOC>
