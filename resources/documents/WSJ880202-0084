Is in Default On Secured Agreements </HL><SO> </SO><CO> WUR </CO><DATELINE> HOUSTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Long-depressed Wurlitzer Co. is sounding another blue note. After years of losing the battle with electronic keyboards and other low-cost competition, the 132-year-old piano maker said it recently failed to make two payments under secured lending agreements.    The company also said it was in default on a variety of lending covenants. The company didn't disclose the total debt involved in the defaults. And on top of everything else, it said it expected to report a $2.1 million loss for the fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31, more than three times the loss of $639,000 a year earlier.    The current financial trouble was compounded by a poor Christmas selling season.    But the company said that although its lenders are secured, it expects them to &quot;take no action&quot; as a result of the defaults under the lending agreements. As previously reported, Wurlitzer has a preliminary agreement to sell its keyboard operations to a unit of Baldwin Piano andamp; Organ Co., Loveland, Ohio, which, Wurlitzer said, will enable it to satisfy all its obligations under its lending agreements.    The sale, if completed, would leave Wurlitzer as a contract manufacturer of furniture, billiard tables and other wood products operating under a new name. </TEXT></DOC>
