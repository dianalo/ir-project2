In an interview with four television network anchormen, Mr. Reagan said he would be &quot;very disappointed&quot; if next week's summit meeting here with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev doesn't lead to another summit in Moscow next year.    Although Mr. Reagan was upbeat about the prospects for a treaty reducing long-range, or strategic, arms, the superpowers are still deeply divided over whether to limit development of space-based missile defenses. The Soviets have said they are unwilling to cut their strategic missile force unless the U.S. agrees to restrict Mr. Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, which aims to develop such defensive systems.    Mr. Reagan repeatedly has said he won't bargain away his SDI program, popularly known as Star Wars, but U.S. arms negotiators have indicated that Washington is prepared to guarantee that the U.S. won't deploy missile defenses until the beginning of 1995. And Mr. Gorbachev recently has hinted that he is willing to seek a compromise on the issue.    The president, who next week with Mr. Gorbachev will sign a treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear arms, said in the interview that he hasn't changed his mind about the nature of the Soviet Union, which he called an &quot;evil empire&quot; in a 1983 speech.    But several times he indicated that he believes Mr. Gorbachev represents a new breed of Soviet leader. The president said Mr. Gorbachev is the first Soviet leader who &quot;has ever expressed a willingness to eliminate weapons they already have,&quot; and he noted that the communist party chief &quot;is willing to say he's prepared to live with other philosophies in other countries.&quot;    Mr. Reagan also indicated that he doesn't hold Mr. Gorbachev responsible for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. &quot;He inherited that,&quot; the president said.    Mr. Reagan told the newscasters he won't cut off aid to rebels fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government in exchange for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. &quot;The people of Afghanistan must be assured of the right of all of them to participate in establishing the government they want, and that requires more than just getting his (Mr. Gorbachev's) forces out of there,&quot; the president said.    But Mr. Reagan abandoned his practice of linking progress on arms control to resolving regional disputes and conflicts over Soviet human rights practices. &quot;You shouldn't link these various programs,&quot; he said.    Although most of the questions dealt with his coming meetings with Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Reagan also was asked whether Vice President George Bush opposed secretly selling arms to Iran. He avoided answering that question, but he gave his fullest explanation of the scandal since two congressional committees found his administration blundered badly, flouted the law, and tried to cover up misdeeds in arming Iran and the Nicaraguan rebels.    Last night, Mr. Reagan backed away from earlier admissions that the arms sales to Iran had degenerated into a swap of arms for American hostages in Lebanon, insisting: &quot;Never at any time did we view this as trading arms for hostages.&quot; Last March 26, referring to the arms sales, he said: &quot;It sort of settled down to just trading arms for hostages . . . .&quot;    He insisted that his administration hadn't armed the Lebanese kidnappers who seized American hostages, and he claimed that if the Ayatollah Khomeini learned the identities of the Iranian intermediaries the U.S. had dealt with, they would &quot;be dead before nightfall.&quot; Congressional investigators, however, have reported that Mr. Reagan's aides consistently dealt with representatives of Iranian parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and other top officials in Tehran.    Mr. Reagan's summit meeting next week with Mr. Gorbachev is likely to be devoted largely to discussions of missile defenses and strategic-arms reductions. In last night's interview, Mr. Reagan offered no hints as to how the basic U.S.-Soviet dispute over his SDI might be resolved. But he said White House polls indicated that 56% of Americans support the Star Wars program and that the figure rose to 71% after Mr. Gorbachev acknowledged earlier this week that Moscow, too, is researching missile defenses.    The Soviets now may be willing to allow some SDI research and development to continue, in the belief that congressional and budget pressures will restrain the program.    Senate leaders from both parties yesterday reached a compromise on the long-debated Star Wars program. The settlement, attached to the defense appropriations bill currently awaiting action by the full Senate, expresses support for the SDI, but only as a research program.    That formulation, which was devised following close consultation with the White House, explicitly states that there hasn't been any decision to deploy strategic defense systems. Rather, it expresses support for a continued, long-term research program &quot;to provide the U.S. with options for responding&quot; to Soviet arms initiatives.    Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska) sponsored the language, along with Democrats William Proxmire of Wisconsin and Bennett Johnston of Louisiana. The compromise seemed to quell some of the dissension surrounding the program, and Sen. Stevens said the White House at least was &quot;happy to see support for the research phase.&quot; However, if the amendment sticks, it effectively would destroy any chances that President Reagan could commit the U.S. to deploying space weapons before he leaves office. </TEXT></DOC>
