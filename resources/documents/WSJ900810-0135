The West German leader set off a political firestorm lastweek when he backed a call from his East German counterpart,Lothar de Maiziere, to accelerate the already hectic schedulefor the full political unity of the two countries. Parties inthe two Germanys already had agreed to hold the vote on Dec.2, and Bonn now says it will stick with that date.</LP><TEXT>   Thursday's decision came in the wake of a stormy sessionof the Bundestag, West Germany's parliament, in which theopposition Social Democrats adamantly refused to approve achange in West Germany's Basic Law needed to clear the wayfor the earlier vote. Mr. Kohl needed a two-thirds majority,and therefore the Social Democrats' support, to succeed.   The dispute illustrates the way politics in the twoGermanys has become hopelessly intertwined. Sister parties inEast and West are working together to give themselves thebest possible chances in the forthcoming elections. For theSocial Democrats, this means putting off the election toallow time for East Germany's deteriorating economy to stir apolitical backlash against Mr. Kohl.   For the same reason, Mr. Kohl and his allies are eager toget the election over with quickly. The longer East Germanyremains separate, they argue, the longer the uncertaintiesremain that have caused Western companies to hold back oninvesting in the East's shattered economy.   Otto Lambsdorff, head of the Free Democrats, the juniorpartner in Mr. Kohl's ruling coalition, told lawmakersyesterday that holding elections in October rather thanDecember would &quot;improve the pyschological situation {in EastGermany} and thereby create better frameworks for theeconomy.&quot;   The dispute erupted as the costs of the German merger areballooning. Yesterday, a top official in Bonn's FinanceMinistry said the country was working on a new supplementalbudget to cover the spiraling costs of German unity. And onWednesday, Mr. Kohl urged the West German banking communityto pump more money into the East and shoulder more of therisks.   &quot;The economic and social situation in East Germany hasworsened faster than we expected,&quot; said Matthias Wissmann, amember of parliament who belongs to Mr. Kohl's ChristianDemocrats. But he emphasized that the government had expecteda difficult transition.   If the situation in East Germany continues to worsen, thecountry could simply throw itself into the arms of WestGermany. Under West German Basic Law, East Germany couldproclaim itself part of West Germany -- and the West wouldhave to accept the decision.   But again, cross-border politics are likely to decide howthis is played out. The Social Democrats in both Germanysfavor merging the two countries under the Basic Law soon,possibly in September. This could give the Social Democrats apowerful political edge, as it might make it even easier forthem to blame the Christian Democrats for the country's woes.   Not surprisingly, the Christian Democrats argue thatformal merger and all-German elections are &quot;two sides of thesame coin&quot; that must take place simultaneously. Otherwise,they argue, the East Germans could find themselves without ademocratically elected government.   It isn't clear if Mr. Kohl would still insist on linkingthe two. In the past, the Bonn government has said unitycouldn't occur before Sept. 12, when the two Germanys and thefour victorious powers from World War II -- the U.S., France,Britain, and the Soviet Union -- meet in Moscow for the lastround of the so-called two-plus-four negotiations.   Meanwhile, Mr. Kohl's decision to back down on theelection date could clear the way for a backlog of badlyneeded legislation in both countries. During this week'sface-off over an election date, the East German parliament --apparently by accident -- failed to muster the votesnecessary to pass the election treaty that sets the groundrules for the coming vote. Both German parliaments are nowexpected to pass the treaty later this month.   The two countries are also still hammering away at asecond state treaty covering issues the two sides weren'table to wrap up in time for the treaty on economic andmonetary union, which took effect July 1.</TEXT></DOC>
