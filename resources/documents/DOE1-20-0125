The pair of lenses can provide true volume imaging, reproducingboth amplitude and phase of the input beam. By using cylindrical lensesit is possible to change the aspect ratio of the beam. By adjusting thecylindrical curvatures, it is possible to minimize reflections by tiltingthe lenses at the Brewster angle.</TEXT></DOC>
