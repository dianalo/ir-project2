Radium (/sup 226/Ra) descended from uranium produce radon (/sup222/Rn) of noble gas by decay. After formation in the ground, radon diffusesinto the atmosphere. Without exception radon decay products are heavymetals which soon become attached to natural aerosols. Therefore, radonand its daughters (decay products) appear also in indoor environment,and generally, their concentration levels become higher than that ofoutdoor air due to build-up effects in the closed indoor environments.With the progress of the study on the influence of radon and its daugherson human health, it has become clear that they act effectively as anexciting cause of lung cancer. So, the study on the risk evaluation ofthem in room air has become to be very important. Concequently, the behaviorsof radon and its daughters in indoor environment, first of all, shouldbe studied in detail for the accurate estimation of the risk caused bythem. In this special edition, fundamental characteristics of radon andits daughters, some measuring methods, theoretical considerations andsome observational evidences obtained from various circumstances of indoorenvironment are described inorder to grasp and understand the behaviorsof radon and its daughters in the indoor environment.</TEXT></DOC>
