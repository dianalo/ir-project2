A primaryadvantage of the fiber packed cell is that light generated by the scintillatoris absorbed to a much less extent by the fibers than by the power scintillatorused in conventional flow cells. A detection efficiency of 55% has beenobtained for carbon-14 using 0.1-mm diameter hand-pulled glass fibers.Computer modeling has shown that even better results can be obtainedby using smaller and more uniform diameter fibers which will allow betterpacking. The fiber cell also demonstrates back pressures which are afactor of 50 less than the conventional cell and much less susceptibilityto absorption of compounds because of its lower surface area.</TEXT></DOC>
