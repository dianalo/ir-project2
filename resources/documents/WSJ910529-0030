It is thefirst such meeting since revolutions swept away most ofEastern Europe's communist governments.   Delegates from post-communist countries said they face thechallenge of re-integrating with the rest of the Continent.   The nine-day session was organized by the Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, which groups the U.S.,Canada and 32 European nations. Albania is an observer, andthe Soviet republics of Lithuania and Estonia are guests. TheUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and CulturalOrganization and the Council of Europe also areparticipating.   &quot;The task is to reunite the West and East of our continentpolitically and economically, spiritually and culturally,&quot; aGerman delegate said. At the last such forum, in Budapest in1985, East-West frictions prevented a final agreement.                                                                                                          JAPAN NUCLEAR SITE'S CLOSURE SET                                                                                                          The plant where a broken tube triggered Japan's worstnuclear accident will be closed more than three years forinvestigation and repairs, Kansai Electric Power Co., itsoperator, said. Steam generators are to be replaced for $507million at the Mihama plant in Fukui state and at two otherplants -- the first such refittings in 19 years. Mihama hasbeen shut since the Feb. 9 accident, in which an emergencycooling system was triggered to prevent a core meltdown.                                                                                                          HAVANA BREAD RATION TO BE CUT                                                                                                          The daily bread ration in Havana will be cut to threeounces a person -- a small loaf or two rolls -- startingSaturday. Shoppers there already face tight rationing ofnearly all processed food items and basic consumer goods. Thebread limit is already in place in the provinces. Cuba hasrationed food for three decades, largely because of theU.S.-imposed embargo, but shortages have worsened in the pastyear.                                                                                                          POLAND TO PRIVATIZE INSURER                                                                                                          Poland's giant state insurance monopoly will be broken upnext year. Polish National Insurance, known by its Polishinitials PZU, has 400 branches and 15,000 employees and wrote100 million policies last year. PZU could be divided intothree: two lines to compete for short-term business, such astheft protection, and one for longer-term policies, such aslife, as new rules ban a company from running both lines.About 20 new private insurers operate in Poland but handleonly 10% of the business; PZU has 60%, and Warta, anotherstate enterprise, 30%.                                                                                                          CONCERNS ABOUT BELGRADE'S DEBT                                                                                                          Political divisions gripping Yugoslavia and deterioratinghard-currency reserves amid a sharp decline in tourism andexport receipts raise a possibility that Belgrade will atleast partly suspend external debt payments this year,Western analysts said. Yugoslavia's debt at the end of 1990was estimated at $16.5 billion. Hard-currency reserves mayhave plunged as much as 52% in the past six months to $4.8billion from $10 billion.                                                                                                          UMBRELLA MURDER CASE CRACKED?                                                                                                          A Bulgarian deputy premier said he is &quot;sure&quot; formerBulgarian Communist officials had a hand in the murder of adissident writer who was killed in London in 1978, allegedlywith a poison-tipped umbrella. The mystery was the subject ofa recent Wall Street Journal feature. Deputy Premier DimitarLudzhev, co-chairman of a government commission reviewing theformer regime's secret-police activities, wouldn't namenames, but said his group will soon publish a report.                                                                                                          REPARATIONS ISSUE PUT TO OAU                                                                                                          Nigeria wants the Organization of African Unity to pressfor reparations for centuries of foreign exploitation. Theidea is getting a mixed reception from African foreignministers.   Nigeria urged the ministers, meeting in Nigeria's newcapital Abuja ahead of next week's OAU summit, to discussreparations. Africa is burdened with about $270 billion offoreign debt -- $32 billion of it owed by Nigeria.   Senior African officials say colonial exploitation and theloss of tens of millions of people through the slave tradedenied Africa the security and labor needed for economicgrowth. Some advocate a plan for Africa similar to the U.S.aid package that helped Europe after World War II.   The 51-nation OAU's secretary-general, Salim Ahmed Salim,said the group must review its position against sanctions onSouth Africa but remain united in its support for blackmajority rule there. This indicated little possibility ofaction, as the African National Congress opposes liftingsanctions.

But drug-related offenses fell 8%.Violent crime, which has been climbing every year since 1977,rose 7%. . . . Following a Kremlin-Vatican rapprochement,Tadeus Kondrusevich, 45, was enthroned as the first RomanCatholic archbishop of Moscow in more than 50 years.</TEXT></DOC>
