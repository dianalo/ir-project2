(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A large man whose death in police custody setoff two nights of street violence suffocated partly from theexhaustion of a violent struggle with officers and from being boundface-down in a small space, a medical report said Friday.   An autopsy revealed that Edgar Allen Price, a 40-year-old blackman, asphyxiated Feb. 1 after the struggle with eight policeofficers during an undercover crack cocaine bust.   Prosecutors are investigating the death to determine if there wasany criminal negligence or wrongdoing on the part of arrestingofficers.   At least 10 people were arrested in the two nights ofdisturbances, and five officers received minor injuries. One grocerystore was looted and torched. The Tampa incidents followed threenights of rioting last month in Miami, which were sparked by thefatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by a policeman.   The 6-foot-3 Price was hogtied, with hands cuffed behind him andlegs manacled then tied to the wrists, normally a method ofrestraint that is ``relatively innocuous. However, in this case adifferent set of circumstances existed,'' Dr. Charles Diggs,associate Hillsborough County medical examiner said in his report.   ``Mr. Price was a 296-pound individual who had undergoneextensive physical exertion and hyperventilation during thescuffle,'' Diggs said. ``By being placed in a limited space with thehead face down into the back seat associated with limited activityfrom being handcuffed and restrained, the necessary conditions forproducing an asphyxial death existed.''   Diggs said the autopsy showed seven bruises on the arms, legs andabdomen and a single 1}-inch cut on the head. ``None of theseinjuries contributed to nor produced the death in this individual,''he added.   Diggs was unavailable for comment Friday, according to medicalinvestigator Jack Hall.   ``I think we pretty much expected this,'' said police spokesmanSteve Cole. ``I don't think there are any surprises. It furtherillustrates he did not die from any wounds from us hitting him, orhe was not choked to death.''   Deputy Police Chief Tom Depolis had acknowledged that officersused nightsticks and flashlights on Price, who was punching andkicking.   Police said they tried to arrest Price after an informant made acrack cocaine buy in College Hill, a predominantly black housingdevelopment.   Price battled officers before he was finally cuffed and bound andplaced belly-down in the back of a cruiser, a routine policeprocedure to subdue a combative prisoner, officials said.   When medical personnel arrived, rock- and bottle-throwing eruptedbefore they could check Price in the back of the cruiser.   ``He was put into the cruiser and removed from the area for hisown safety,'' said Cole.   It was after a one-minute ride that officials noticed Price washaving trouble breathing, authorities said. He died at a hospitaltwo hours later.   Police officers who subdued Price said he was conscious andshowed no signs of breathing problems when they put him in the car.   Two officers have been placed on administrative leave whileprosecutors review the case.   Price served 11 years of a 50-year prison sentence in Texas forattempted murder of a Houston police officer and a string ofrobberies. He was paroled in 1984 and came to Tampa in 1986, policesaid. His girlfriend said Price worked as a long-distance truckerand laborer.   The Tampa Tribune reported Friday that Price had no cocaine inhis system when he died but had a blood-alcohol level of 0.06percent. The legal standard for drunken driving is 0.10.</TEXT></DOC>
