<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-72-0284 </DOCNO><TEXT>Pulsed NMR relaxation-time measurements have been performed on PdT/subx/, aged approximately eight years, after first removing most of thetritium by room-temperature desorption and again after addition of protiumto one of these tritide-free samples. Spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxationtimes T{sub 1} and T{sub 2} were measured for both tritium and {sup 3}Hein the temperature range 100--300 K, while T{sub 1}, T{sub 2}, and therotating-frame relaxation time T{sub 1}/sub rho/ were obtained for protiumin the same temperature range. The relative magnitudes of T{sub 1}, thedecay time T{sub 2}/sub m/ of the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill signals,and the line-shape decay time T{sub 2}/sup */ for {sup 3}He in tritide-freePdT/sub x/, are consistent with the distribution of the helium as microbubblesin the Pd matrix. The increase in the {sup 3}He values of T{sub 1} uponaddition of protium to an atomic ratio [H]/[Pd] = 0.68 is attributedpartially to a decrease in the Fermi-level density of states and partiallyto other internal relaxation mechanisms. Analysis of the dipolar componentT{sub 1}/sub d/ of T{sub 1}, for protons in the sample to which protiumwas added, gives a value of the diffusion activation energy at temperaturesbetween 230 and 300 K which is in agreement with that for {beta}-PdH/subx/. Comparison with the triton NMR in tritide-free PdT/sub x/ indicatesthat the residual tritium, rather than forming a dilute solid solution,occupies unusual sites in the Pd lattice, perhaps at internal surfacessurrounding the {sup 3}He microbubbles.</TEXT></DOC>
