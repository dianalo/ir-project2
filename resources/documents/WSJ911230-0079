But withmillions of people likely to flow across internationalborders this decade, the U.S. will have to formulate a newpolicy.   It used to be easy to decide who could enter the U.S. as arefugee: those fleeing communism were eligible; most othersweren't. Even after a 1980 U.S. law redefined a refugee assomeone with a &quot;wellfounded fear of persecution,&quot; some 90% ofthose allowed to enter the U.S. as refugees have continued tobe people from the former Soviet Union, Southeast Asia orCuba. The bulk of other would-be entrants seeking shelter --most recently, Haitians -- have been excluded.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Our refugee policy is totally a creature of the Cold War,and now with that gone the basic moorings of the policy areadrift,&quot; says Doris Meissner, a former U.S. immigrationofficial who now is a senior associate at the CarnegieEndowment. &quot;We need to take a more comprehensive look at howto protect people where they are and then help provide fortheir repatriation.&quot;   To be sure, many of this decade's refugees won't be comingto the U.S. With the winding down of regional conflictsspawned by the Cold War in such places as southern Africa,Central America and Afghanistan, millions of victims of theviolence now want to go home. Afghanistan alone has producedone-third of the world's 15 million refugees, U.S. officialssay. They will require considerable assistance from the U.S.and other wealthy nations to be resettled in their owncountries.   Meanwhile, experts say, a new generation of refugees willarise from political changes in the former Soviet Union andEastern Europe, from disasters such as famine in the horn ofAfrica and floods in Bangladesh, and from ethnic conflicts insuch places as Yugoslavia.   Many of these people won't meet the narrow U.S. definitionof refugee; they won't be fleeing individual persecution,but, rather, general chaos. Already, some private groups arecalling for a broadening of the definition to help some ofthese people enter the U.S. The Refugee Policy Group, anonprofit research center, proposes a new category that wouldpermit entry of refugees for general humanitarian reasons.Susan Forbes Martin, a senior associate at the group, saysmany people fleeing the collapse of the former Soviet Union,for instance, could be granted refugee status under such acategory.   &quot;My sense is that in the future we'll probably have fewerpeople admitted under the traditional refugee category andmore through such a humanitarian category,&quot; Ms. Martin said.   The U.S. will accept as many as 142,000 people in 1992 forpermanent resettlement as refugees, up from 131,000 thisyear. Most will be people from the former Soviet Union andVietnam, to whom the U.S. has a &quot;historical obligation,&quot; saidPrinceton Lyman, the State Department's director of refugeeprograms. He concedes that it will take three to four yearsto accommodate those people. But, he adds, his office alreadyis thinking about how to assist future refugees. Forinstance, this month, the department was host to a two-weektrip here by Russian legislators to meet with U.S. officialsand private voluntary refugee organizations.   Mr. Lyman said that once the current pipeline is cleared,there could be sharp reductions in the overall number ofrefugees admitted, perhaps dropping closer to the rate of40,000 annually that prevailed in the years before the Sovietand Vietnamese governments permitted huge numbers of theircitizens to come here.   &quot;In the next year or two we want to emphasizerepatriation,&quot; he said. The United Nations' High Commissionerfor Refugees, Sadako Ogata, also has declared 1992 the &quot;yearof repatriation,&quot; as conditions ripen for millions ofdisplaced persons to begin the journey home.   Another reason the gateway to the U.S. is expected tonarrow is what Robert DeVecchi, executive director of theInternational Rescue Committee, calls &quot;compassion fatigue.&quot;He said that in places such as California, where huge numbersof refugees settle, the combination of recession and ageneral inclination to turn inward now that the Cold War isover makes refugees more of a burden.   As a result, after a 12-year period during which nearlyone million refugees arrived in the U.S., &quot;there is someincreasing sentiment in Congress and the administration thatit's a bottomless pit and costly,&quot; said Mr. DeVecchi.</TEXT></DOC>
