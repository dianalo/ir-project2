In a report to Congress, the administration said companies in West Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Switzerland also are engaged in such sales, either &quot;without government permission&quot; or by selling items that are in the &quot;gray area between civilian and military application.&quot;    The report to Congress was mandated under the anti-apartheid law passed last year over President Reagan's veto. The law, which imposed economic sanctions on South Africa, vaguely threatens to cut U.S. military aid to countries that violate the 1977 U.N. arms embargo. Israel receives $1.8 billion annually in U.S. military aid, but most experts say a cutoff is unlikely.    Two weeks ago, Israel announced it wouldn't sign any new military contracts with South Africa and that it would consider severing certain cultural ties. It had been widely expected that Israel and several West European countries would be named in the report.    Rep. Howard Berman (D., Calif.), a pro-Israel legislator, said yesterday before seeing the report that Israel was the only nation among those suspected of selling arms to South Africa that had announced it would discontinue such shipments.    French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, on a Washington visit, told a news conference that he was surprised by reports that France was on the list. &quot;May I tell you that France stopped the sale of armaments to South Africa about 10 years ago,&quot; Mr. Chirac said, according to the Associated Press. But he didn't indicate whether he was denying the existence of clandestine shipments or just those sanctioned by the government.    South Africa, according to the report, has developed a &quot;large and sophisticated indigenous arms industry&quot; in response to the embargo, but still imports items it can't manufacture. The report said the U.S. had only &quot;a partial, incomplete and somewhat random picture&quot; of arms sales to South Africa because many of these sales are small, difficult to detect and concealed by South Africa and arms shippers.    The administration has prepared classified and unclassified reports on the matter for Congress. The unclassified version stated that more detailed information about arms shipments was included in the classified report. </TEXT></DOC>
