Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton outlined the tentative agenda for thesummit Thursday and said the meetings slated for Sept. 27-28 inCharlottesville, Va., must result in agreement on what childrenshould know before graduation.   National performance targets or goals are essential to ``sustainthis education reform movement'' that started with the government's1983 ``Nation at Risk'' report, which alerted the country toschools' academic failures, Clinton told reporters.   ``I wake up at night with a bad dream that the education reformmovement will go the way of the hula hoop, twist and the Edsel,'' hesaid.   Clinton, a Democrat, met with White House officials Wednesday,along with South Carolina Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell, todiscuss the agenda and other details of the summit.   Talks will focus on six topics that ``are broad enough to embraceeverything we need to discuss,'' Clinton said. The remaining disputeis whether the meetings will be open.   Clinton said the issues will include ``teaching as aprofession''; the learning environment of children, including thespecial needs of the disadvantaged and drug-free schools;restructuring schools, including ways to give parents and childrenmore options; ``lifelong learning,'' including adult literacy,vocational and on-the-job training; higher education; and theresponsibilities of the various levels of government.   ``I think it will be very interesting to see what will come outof this in terms of specifics,'' said Clinton. ``But I wouldn'tminimize the importance of having a national set of performancegoals which the president embraces.''   Clinton said he had not spoken to all of the governors aboutsetting national goals. But he said the idea ``has consistently beenour policy and I have no reason to believe they aren't'' in favor ofthat approach.   The White House officials, Clinton said, were ``pretty positive.''   The Arkansas governor also is pushing to keep most of the summitsessions open.   Responding to reports that some governors are upset that theworking meetings will be closed, White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater said the governors told the White House they wanted itthat way ``so they were free to tell (the president) what theyreally thought.''   ``The only sessions that are closed are the working sessions andI think they prefer them that way,'' he said. Fitzwater promisedample media access to the plenary sessions and ``press conferencesback-to-back every minute of the morning.''</TEXT></DOC>
