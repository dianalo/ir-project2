Forstmann Little andamp; Co., which has profited hugely from its1984 leveraged buy-out of the Brooklyn-based sports card andbubble gum maker, said it plans to distribute its remaining53% stake to the partners who invested in the deal.</LP><TEXT>   The move will reduce Forstmann's control and free theroughly 35 partners to decide for themselves how to handletheir shares. The 25.3 million shares they will receive havea value of $398.5 million, based on yesterday's price forTopps public shares of $15.75 each, up 25 cents, in nationalover-the-counter trading.   The distribution will boost the returns Forstmann and itspartners have reaped from Topps to nearly 70 times theiroriginal investment, which was about $10 million in equity aspart of the $96 million buy-out. Besides the distribution,the returns include dividends and income from a 1987 publicoffering of a 30% stake.   Wm. Brian Little, a Forstmann partner, said thedistribution results from a decision that Topps &quot;is now amature entity that is more of a stock market investment thana leveraged company.&quot;   He cited the company's repayment in recent years of morethan $200 million in debt. Topps, which had less than $25million in debt as of June, expects to be debtfree by the endof its current fiscal year in February 1992, Mr. Little said.   Given the deal's success, several analysts expressedsurprise at the distribution and suggested it may reflectdiscord among partners about Forstmann's strategy. They citedthe abandonment of several secondary public offerings, mostrecently one six months ago after Topps shares sank on lowerprofit projections.   &quot;It seems that some of the partners wanted to sell stockand some didn't,&quot; said Alan Silverman, managing director ofLadenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co.   Mr. Little denied Forstmann had been pressured by itslimited partners. But he said, &quot;We don't feel the price iscurrently high enough to support&quot; a secondary offering. Hewouldn't specify a desired value, but several analystssuggested a price in the high-teens to low-20s. Topps's52-week stock-price high is $19.   Mr. Little said he didn't know how individual partnerswould handle their shares. He also declined to specify thesize of his stake, his plans or those of his three partnersin Forstmann. But he said he and his Forstmann colleagueswill retain seats on the Topps board and &quot;will continue to besubstantial investors in Topps.&quot;   In its Feb. 28 fiscal year, Topps earned $54.1 million on$290 million in sales.</TEXT></DOC>
