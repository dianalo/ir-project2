The Canadian government also intends to seek improvedaccess to the U.S. government procurement market, Canadianofficials said.</LP><TEXT>   The Canadian objectives were set out as U.S., Canadian andMexican officials prepared to meet in Toronto Wednesday forthe start of negotiations for a North American free-tradeagreement. The proposed agreement is expected to build on theU.S.-Canada free-trade agreement that provides for a gradualphasing out of tariffs and some other trade barriers.   The Canadian government aims, through the tripartitenegotiations, to get a better deal for Canadian banks thanwas achieved in the U.S.-Canada trade pact. Canadian bankscomplain that the U.S.-Canada agreement provided them withonly modest gains in the U.S. compared with what U.S. banksgot in Canada, because of Canada's more liberal banking laws.U.S. banks are now free to open a branch anywhere in Canada,but Canadian banks say they still face state-level obstaclesto branch expansion in the U.S. The Mexican restrictions aremuch tighter, limiting the operations of most foreign banksto representative offices.   John Weekes, Canada's chief negotiator in the trade talks,said Canada will also press the U.S. to remove various&quot;discriminatory barriers&quot; to Canadian bidding for U.S.government contracts. These include so-called &quot;buy American&quot;restrictions and various set-aside provisions that favor U.S.interests.   The U.S. is expected to press Canada to abolish allegedlydiscriminatory laws favoring Canadian &quot;cultural&quot; industries.These include a law barring Canadian companies from takingtax deductions for the costs of advertisements on U.S. radioand TV stations that are aimed at the Canadian market.   Canadian Trade Minister Michael Wilson noted that culturalindustries were largely exempt from the U.S.-Canadafree-trade agreement. &quot;The free-trade agreement is signed,sealed and delivered. We will not negotiate it twice,&quot; hesaid. &quot;That applies in particular to pressure from U.S. lobbygroups to challenge Canada's special measures of support forits cultural industry. That pressure will not work.&quot;   Julius Katz, deputy U.S. trade representative, said theU.S. hasn't agreed to exclude any issue from the tripartitenegotiations, but he declined to say how the U.S. intended todeal with the cultural-industry matter.   Mr. Katz said the North American negotiations could be&quot;greatly facilitated&quot; by resolution of various trade issuesin the Uruguay round of international trade talks in Geneva.Another U.S. official predicted Canada would be more disposedto make concessions in the Geneva talks than in the NorthAmerican negotiations on such contentious issues as Canada'scompulsory licensing laws for pharmaceuticals.   The U.S. government and the brand-name drug industry havebeen urging Canada to provide tougher patent protection forpharmaceuticals. Under Canada's compulsory licensing laws, ageneric copy of a patented drug may be imported and sold inCanada after the drug has been on the Canadian market for 10years. Jack Kay, vice chairman of the Canadian DrugManufacturers' Association, a generic trade group, said hewas concerned that Mexico would support the U.S. position,isolating Canada on the patent issue. Canada's compulsorylicensing laws were designed to reduce drug costs.   Tough bargaining is also expected over a U.S. proposal toincrease to 60% from 50% the North American contentrequirement for new cars and trucks that are tradedduty-free. The U.S. proposal is supported by Canadian autoparts makers and by most North American-based auto companies.But it is opposed by the Canadian government because of itspotential impact on exports to the U.S. of Japanese carsproduced in Canada. The issue is of major importance toCanada because Canadian exports of autos and parts to theU.S. almost equal Canadian exports of all goods to all othercountries.   Canada's preferential position in the U.S. auto market isjeopardized by Mexico's current trade rules that provideduty-free relief for imports for vehicles produced inMaquiladora trade zones. If the duty-free treatment ofMaquiladora imports from Japan and other countries isn'tdealt with, Mexican producers will have a competitiveadvantage over producers in Canada and the U.S., warnedRonald Wonnacott, University of Western Ontario professor ofeconomics. This would lead to &quot;a costly distortion in tradeand investment,&quot; he said.   The U.S. government has pledged that the planned agreementwill include tough rules of origin for goods to assure thatNorth American products benefit from the planned free-tradearrangement. The U.S.-Canada free-trade pact requires that acertain percentage of manufacturing costs, mostly 50%, beincurred in the U.S. or Canada in order to receive duty-freetreatment.</TEXT></DOC>
