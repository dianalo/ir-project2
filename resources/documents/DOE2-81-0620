Specifically, they integrate Two-Phase Locking, TimestampOrdering, and Precedence Agreement into one unified concurrency controlscheme. They show the correctness of the new scheme and study the problemof selecting the best protocol for each transaction in order to optimizesystem performance.</TEXT></DOC>
