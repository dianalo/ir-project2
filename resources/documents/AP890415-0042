WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With hardly a river anyone would swimin and forests dead or dying of acid rain, it seems Europeans havedecided ecology is not just for leftists anymore.   Heightened awareness has pushed the issue from the fringe to thefore, lending more respectability and clout to the parties thatfirst made Mother Earth a candidate.   Members of the once-radical Greens hold Parliament seats in WestGermany, Belgium, Italy and Austria. Berlin's governing coalitionincludes Greens, and France's Greens, Les Verts, had surprisingsuccess in municipal elections last month.   Ecology parties hope to double their representation in theEuropean Parliament in elections June 18, and unofficial sisterparties of the Greens have sprung up in the Soviet bloc.   Little unity is evident among the dozens of parties born ofconcern for man's ravaging of the planet, but all benefit fromgrowing worry about pollutants in the air, water and food supplies.   ``Environmental consciousness has for years been coming to theforefront, and a number of environmental catastrophes haveaccelerated this,'' said Ruth Hammerbacher, a 36-year-oldsociologist who is the moderate new leader of West Germany's Greens.   Rhine River chemical spills, North Sea oil slicks andradioactive fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster finallyhave moved Europeans to action on recycling and restraint, she said.   A turn to the left among voters also has brightened thepolitical fortunes of some European Greens.   But Greens parties differ widely by country and ``the result isa painfully underdeveloped network of contacts and coordination,''said Juergen Maier, who nurtures the Greens' fledglinginternational relations.   ``We have no world development plan,'' said Maier, a pragmatisttypical of today's mellower Greens. ``In most cases we had littleto do with the foundation of foreign Greens parties.''   Ms. Hammerbacher attributes some of the environmentalistparties' new prominence to ``the graying of the Greens,'' amoderating with age that helps attract West German voters. Theparty born in the student and anti-war groups of a generation agonow is dominated by people pushing 40.   The decision to play politics and build a more cohesiveinternational network earns the scorn of such Old Guard partyfigures as Petra Kelly, who accuses the new leadership ofabandoning principles in an ``opportunist'' quest for power.   Despite the new respectability, Greens parties still havelimited influence, often getting less than 5 percent of the vote innational elections. They are strongest in West Germany, with 43,000members and the support of 8-9 percent at the polls.   Inter-Green relations are too informal for a joint strategy inthe European Parliament elections, but individual parties acrossthe continent seem to smell the same opportunity.   British Greens secretary Sara Parkin told her party conferencethis month she was ``wildly optimistic'' about the chances. For thefirst time, Greens candidates are contesting all 78 British seatsin the 518-member legislature based in Strasbourg, France, whichdetermines policy and joint strategy on issues affecting the entirecontinent, such as the environment.   Getting into the British Parliament is tougher because of thewinner-take-all electoral system, which contrasts with the moreflexible proportional representation common on the continent.   France's Parliament has no Greens, but Les Verts won 926 postsin local and regional elections last month. Resentment of urban airpollution is growing in France, and Les Verts focus solely onenvironmental issues.   In Italy, the Verdi party has been in Parliament less than twoyears, but recent local elections show a steady increase insupport. Spokesman Gianluca Felicetti said it was ``the only partywith potential for a notable increase in votes'' for the EuropeanParliament.   Austrian Greens spokesman Stefan Schennach estimated his party'ssupport at about 8 percent nationwide and predicted it would win 12seats in the next parliamentary election. Seven of the currentParliament's 183 members are Greens.   Environmentalists have established Greens parties in Poland,Hungary and the Soviet Union, but none has been granted officialstatus.   West Germany's Greens, the originals, have the most impressiverecord. They have gained respect after six years in the Bundestag,or Parliament, despite occasional antics, and hold 43 of the 519seats.   ``Voters now see the possibility of getting Greens candidateselected; they don't fear wasting their vote,'' said Helmut Lippelt,a 57-year-old historian in the Greens delegation.   The party's conduct in the Bundestag has changed over the years.   Greens still knit occasionally during debates and the Parliamentpresident censured one recently for shouting accusations, but theyno longer let their guests lob paint-filled balloons at speakers.</TEXT></DOC>
