Negotiators for Bell Atlantic Corp. offered Communications Workers of America bargainers a number of changes to the company's proposed contract, including amendments to the medical benefits package, a company spokesman said. About 52,000 employees, including 11,000 represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, have been striking Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic since Aug. 6.    Bargainers at Pacific Telesis also were scheduled to meet, but no breakthroughs were predicted. Last week, the company sent letters to 42,000 union workers explaining details of its offer and trying to gauge support among the rank and file. The union countered with letters rebutting the company's claims.    No talks have been scheduled at Chicago-based Ameritech Corp. nor at New York-based Nynex Corp. At Ameritech, some 40,000 workers went on strike Sunday morning after the previous three-year contract with the CWA expired. At Nynex, some 40,000 CWA and 20,000 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers are out on strike.    In the meantime, the number of arrests and incidents of vandalism apparently linked to the strikes continued to grow. In Nynex's New York and New England territories, some 60 workers have been arrested on picket lines, and both Nynex and Bell Atlantic reported unusually high instances of vandalism. A Bell Atlantic spokesman said that since the strike began, the company has recorded 120 cases of vandalism, including 70 cases of severed cables. </TEXT></DOC>
