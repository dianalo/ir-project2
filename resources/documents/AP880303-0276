WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Democrats Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt stepped up theirattacks on each other for taking money from special interestsThursday, with Gephardt raising ``the specter of a serious conflictof interest.'' Republican Bob Dole and Democrat Albert Gore Jr.touted new endorsements.   Dole won backing from a favorite of the Republican right, formerU.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Gore got support fromCharles Robb, the former governor of Virginia, and Gov.-elect BuddyRoemer of Louisiana.   Both parties' presidential hopefuls focused on the big round ofprimaries coming up across the South and elsewhere.   Republican front-runner George Bush and rivals Pat Robertson andJack Kemp were all in South Carolina, where Republicans voteSaturday in what Bush hopes will be a victory that propels himtoward far more delegates in the rest of the South on Super Tuesday.   A poll in Friday's editions of The Washington Post suggestedBush holds a decisive lead in the state. In the survey of 1,000people who say they will vote in Saturday's primary, 49 percentsupported Bush, 26 percent Dole, 14 percent Robertson and 7 percentKemp.   Robertson bought half an hour of air time on television stationsaround South Carolina Thursday night to ``set the record straight''on religion issues. The former television evangelist said hebelieves in the separation of church and state, but added: ``I donot and I will not deny my beliefs or my church.''   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, began airing a televisioncommercial that mocks Gephardt's claim to be fighting against theestablishment. The ad lists some of the corporate political actioncommittees and other special interests that have contributed toGephardt's campaign.   The Missouri congressman fired back with an accusation thatDukakis was bankrolled by ``an all-star cast of EasternEstablishment money interests'' as well as individuals andbusinesses that are regulated by his state government.   ``I'll gladly give back every penny in PAC contributions if MikeDukakis will return the millions he's received from specialinterests who do business with the state of Massachusetts,''Gephardt said. ``These are people who depend on the stategovernment he runs for their livelihood, and it raises the specterof a serious conflict of interest.''   Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach said the campaign has taken nomoney from any corporate PACs or registered lobbyists inMassachusetts.   Gephardt also found himself under attack from a new Goretelevision commercial.   Gore's ad, aired across the South, is a 60-second clip fromtheir debate in Dallas two weeks ago, when Gore accused Gephardt offlip-flops on a list of issues, including President Reagan'seconomic proposals. ``Where are you this week on Reaganomics?''Gore asks Gephardt.   On the campaign trail, Dukakis defended his opposition to a feeon imported oil in Texas, the big prize of Super Tuesday primariesand a state where local sentiment runs in favor of the tax. He saidan oil import fee ``will put a $50 bilion burden on this nation'seconomy.''   He also lashed out at the heart of Gephardt's populist message,his call for tough retaliatory trade sanctions, dismissing them as``policies that almost destroyed us 50 years ago.''   Gephardt was back in his home state after picking up $425,000 attwo fund-raisers there a day before _ money that is critical forgetting his message on television ads in the South.   In Kansas City, he visited a General Motors automobile assemblyplant that is scheduled to close in April because of poor domesticauto sales. He pledged a fight to open foreign markets to U.S. cars.   Among the other Democrats, Jesse Jackson campaigned in the oilpatch, telling the Oklahoma Legislature he hopes to revitalize thedomestic oil industry through an alliance with Canada and LatinAmerican countries to reduce dependence on OPEC states in theMiddle East.   Bidding to expand beyond his base of black voters, Jackson wonthe endorsement of a vetern white Oklahoma lawmaker and won astanding ovation from a joint session of the Legislature.   Gore, whose entire presidential strategy depends onjump-starting his campaign in the Southern primaries, gained inRobb one of the Southern endorsements he has most sought.   Robb, favored to win a GOP-held Senate seat this year inVirginia, said Gore's foreign policy and defense policy ``moreclosely aligns itself with what I think is right for our party andright for the country.''   Dole appeared with Kirkpatrick at a Washington news conference,saying she ``symbolizes the soul of the Reagan revolution.'' Hiscampaign readied television commercials featuring the endorsementof Kirkpatrick, a former Democrat and university professor whosetough talk against communism endeared her to President Reagan.   Dole also spoke at a White House conference on drug abuse andurged a federal death penalty for drug ``overlords and kingpins.''He opposed distributing clean needles to drug addicts, as is beingdone in New York to combat the spread of AIDS, saying ``it alsoendorses addiction.''   Bush continued to focus most of his Southern campaign on SouthCarolina, and in Rock Hill he invoked a quote from former baseballplayer Yogi Berra in stressing his experience.   ``I won't make the wrong mistakes,'' Bush said.   Kemp kept up his tough talk on Panama, calling for revoking thePanama Canal treaty if that country's military strongman Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega, indicted on U.S. drug charges, retainspower.   ``If they want to keep Noriega, we're going to have to keep thePanama Canal,'' Kemp said.   Robertson, the GOP wildcard candidate who is also focusing onSouth Carolina, traveled by bus along the towns of the Pee DeeRiver.   Robertson's organizational strength helped him score atwo-to-one victory over Bush in Alaska's precinct caucuses the daybefore.</TEXT></DOC>
