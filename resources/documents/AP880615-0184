Announcements made Wednesday in both Paris and Tehran saidambassadors will be exchanged soon.   How far France went to meet conditions set by Iran forre-establishment of relations was not clear immediately. Ten Frenchhostages were freed at intervals over a two-year period of fitfulnegotiations.   Jean Gueguinou, chief Foreign Ministry spokesman, indicated thedecision would not hinder France's friendship with Iraq, with whichIran has been at war since September 1980. Iran has demandedneutrality from France, which is Iraq's main Western arms supplier.   A ministry statement said: ``The government of the FrenchRepublic and the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran haveagreed to re-establish diplomatic relations beginning June 16,1988. They have also agreed to exchange ambassadors shortly.''   Years of stormy relations preceded the break in relations July17, 1987 after Iranian Embassy employee Wahid Gordji refused toturn himself in for questioning about a series of bombings in Parisnearly a year earlier.   Iran has been trying to break out of its diplomat isolation. Thelast barriers to renewed relations with France were removed in thedeal made with former Premier Jacques Chirac's conservativegovernment for release of the last three French hostages held bypro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.   Journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann and diplomats Marcel Carton andMarcel Fontaine were freed days before the May 8 presidentialelection in a move largely viewed as an electoral ploy.   Chirac was the conservative candidate and lost to PresidentFrancois Mitterrand, a Socialist who won a second seven-year term.   In welcoming the three men home May 5, Chirac thanked Iran forits role in the releases and said relations could be restored.   Mitterrand ordered the process set in motion two weeks later.Michel Rocard, the new Socialist premier, said his government foundno written record of the hostage deal but declared: ``France gaveits word. It will be kept ... for that which is known.''   French and Iranian emissaries met in Geneva to work out whatGueguinou, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said were ``technicaldetails and a timetable,'' suggesting that essential issues weredealt with earlier.   He said renewing ties ``does not imply any change in Frenchpolicy in regard to the problems of the region.''   Chirac had made the freeing of French hostages a top priorityand the series of releases prompted charges that his governmentdealt with the terrorists holding Western hostages in Lebanon.   Eighteen foreigners still are captives in Lebanon, includingnine Americans. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief MiddleEast correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March16, 1985.   Iran had made normal diplomatic relations the price of using itsinfluence with the groups holding French hostages.   As conditions for restoring ties, Iran demanded that Francerepay, with interest, a $1 billion loan the late Shah Mohammad RezaPahlavi made for a nuclear plant; stop harboring dissidentIranians, and be neutral in the Iran-Iraq war. Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini's fundamentalist regime overthrew the shah in February1979.   In June 1986, after one French hostage was freed, Franceexpelled Massoud Rajavi. He leads the People's Mujahedeen of Iran,the main armed opposition group, and now is based in Iraq.   France expelled 17 Mujahedeen supporters to Gabon in December1987 after two more hostages were freed, but the expulsions laterwere revoked because of public pressure.   Two payments were made on the loan in 1986 and 1987, coincidingin each case with the release of a French hostage.   Then came the dispute over Gordji, which developed into``embassy war'' in which the authorities in each capital besiegedthe other's embassy.   On Nov. 29, two days after two more French hostages werereleased, Gordji was allowed to return to Tehran in exchange forPaul Torri, first secretary of the French Embassy, whom theIranians had accused of spying.</TEXT></DOC>
