The February 4, 1986, proposed rule, commonlyreferred to as Part 501, provided requirements for approvable State sludgemanagement programs, for their submission, and for their review and approvalby EPA. The Part 501 regulatory program was designed to ensure the environmentallysound use and disposal of sewage sludge and assure that the federal standardsfor sludge use and disposal promulgated under section 405(d) of the CleanWater Act and other federal statutes would be met. On March 9, 1988, EPA reproposed the Part 501 State sludge management programrules and also proposed revisions to the National Pollutant Discharge EliminationSystem (NPDES) permit requirements and procedures (Parts 122, 123, and124) to integrate sludge permitting and State program requirements intothe NPDES program (53 FR 7642). EPA took this action to implement significantchanges in the sludge management provisions in Section 405 of the CleanWater Act made by the Water Quality Act of 1987. Today, EPA is issuinga final rule which establishes State sludge management program requirementsand procedures for non-NPDES State programs (Part 501) and revises theNPDES permit requirements and procedures (Parts l22, 123, and 124) to incorporatesludge permitting and State program requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The effective date of this regulation is June 1, 1989.In accordance with 40 CFR Part 23 (50 FR 7268, February 21, 1985), theseregulations shall be considered issued for purposes of judicial reviewat l:00 p.m. eastern time on May 16, 1989.

Background </ITAG>Implementation of the Clean Water Act (CWA) has resulted in greater levelsof treatment of and pollutant removal from wastewater before dischargeto surface waters, and the generation of large quantities of residual sewagesludge as a by-product of wastewater treatment. Proper management of ever-growingamounts of sewage sludge is becoming increasingly important as effortsto remove pollutants from wastewater have become more effective. In theUnited States, the quantity of municipal sewage sludge has almost doubledsince the enactment of the Clean Water Act in 1972. Municipalities currentlygenerate over 7.7 million dry metric tons of wastewater sludge per year,or approximately 64 pounds per person per year (dry weight basis). Thisvolume is expected to double by the year 2000. An important means of dealing with the pressing problem of disposing ofvast quantities of sewage sludge is through beneficial use and recyclingprojects. Sewage sludge is a valuable resource. The nutrients and otherproperties commonly found in sludge make it useful as a fertilizer anda soil conditioner. Sludge has been used for its beneficial qualities onagricultural lands, in forests, for landscaping projects, and to reclaimstrip-mined land. EPA seeks to encourage such practices. In addition tosupporting a number of long-term research and demonstration projects andthe development of detailed design guidance for various land applicationpractices, EPA has supported and promoted pretreatment and source-controlprograms to improve sludge quality and such technologies as compostingand lime stabilization. The Agency has also supported the development ofimproved dewatering systems, chemical fixation, digestion, pyrolysis andother technologies to help improve energy recovery from thermal conversionsystems, methane recovery from anaerobic stabilization systems, and therecovery of various potentially marketable by-products from sludge. At the same time, sewage sludge may present an environmental concern becauseof contamination by harmful pollutants. Greater focus on surface watertoxics control, as well as Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)provisions such as the ban on land disposal of certain hazardous wastes(section 3004(d)) and the exclusion of discharges into municipal sewersfrom RCRA requirements (section 1004(27)), may result in increased volumesof toxic and hazardous pollutants that reach publicly owned treatment works(POTWs) and consequently may adversely affect sludge quality when thesepollutants are removed from the wastewater. Proper disposal of sewage sludge is important because contaminated or improperlyhandled sludge can result in pollutants in the sludge re-entering the environment,and possibly contaminating a number of different media through a varietyof exposure pathways. Improper sludge management could lead to significantenvironmental degradation of land and air. Failure to dispose of sludgeproperly could also have serious effects on surface and ground water andwetlands, as well as human health. For example, sewage sludge disposedon land where there is minimal depth to ground water is of concern becausecontaminants in the sludge may leach out and reach a potential potablewater source. Concern for air quality necessitates proper controls oversludge incineration. The interrelationship among these media requires atightly coordinated, comprehensive approach that closes environmental loopholes,helps assure that solving problems in one media will not create problemsfor another, and encourages the beneficial reuse of sludge. Prior to the enactment of the Water Quality Act of 1987, the federal authoritiesand regulations related to the use and disposal of sewage sludge were scatteredamong various statutes and programs and did not provide States and municipalitieswith comprehensive guidelines on which to base sludge management decisions.For example, section 405 of the Clean Water Act required the developmentof sludge standards by December 1978, but did not specify how the standardswere to be implemented. Standards developed pursuant to section 405 havebeen promulgated for cadmium, PCBs, and pathogens only when sludge is land-applied(40 CFR Part 257). In addition, sludge is regulated under a number of otherprograms, such as new source performance standards and national emissionsstandards for hazardous air pollutants under the Clean Air Act, requirementsfor solid waste landfills under Subtitle D (and Subtitle C if the sludgeis hazardous) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, ocean dumpingrequirements under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act(MPRSA), and PCB controls under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Theseregulations often use different methodologies and approaches to controllingsludge management practices. Concerns about the potential environmental problems created by impropersewage sludge use and disposal and the lack of a comprehensive legislativeframework governing sludge management led to the establishment of an intra-AgencySludge Task Force by EPA in early 1982 to conduct a study and make recommendationsfor Agency actions in the sludge management area. The Sludge Task Force,with representatives from EPA's Offices of Water, Air, and Solid Waste,approached sludge management from a multi-media perspective. The Task Forcedeveloped the Agency's ``Policy on Municipal Sludge Management'' (49 FR24358, June 12, 1984). The purpose of the policy was to establish a consistentapproach to sludge management across all environmental media and all managementpractices and to establish the appropriate roles of the federal, Stateand local governments in sludge management. The ``Policy on Municipal Sludge Management'' established several importantprinciples which continue to guide the Agency's approach to sludge management.It states, in part:<ITAG tagnum="21">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will actively promotethose municipal sludge management practices that provide for the beneficialuse of sludge while maintaining or improving environmental quality andprotecting public health. To implement this policy, EPA will continue toissue regulations that protect public health and other environmental values.The Agency will use all available authorities to ensure that States establishand maintain programs to ensure that local governments utilize sludge managementtechniques that are consistent with Federal and State regulations and guidelines.Local communities will remain responsible for choosing among alternativeprograms, for planning, constructing and operating facilities to meet theirneeds, and for ensuring the continuing availability of adequate and acceptabledisposal or use capacity. 49 FR 24358 (June 12, 1984). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">II. February 4, 1986 Proposed Rule</ITAG>On February 4, 1986, EPA proposed State Sewage Sludge Management ProgramRegulations (51 FR 4458). These proposed rules would have required Statesto develop sludge management programs to assure that the use and disposalof sewage sludge complies with existing as well as planned federal sludgeuse and disposal standards. These regulations were proposed pursuant torecommendations of the Agency's Sludge Task Force, which concluded thatthe best approach for sludge management would be to require each Stateto prepare a program to implement the sludge standards, which would thenbe reviewed for sufficiency by EPA. The regulations were proposed underthe legal authorities of the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act,and the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. Under the proposal, States would submit to EPA for review and approvala description of their existing sludge management programs with plans andschedules for improving them as necessary to meet the added requirementsof the proposal. The proposal set forth minimum requirements for approvablesludge management programs and provided the procedural requirements forsubmitting, approving, revising and withdrawing approval of such programs.EPA postponed finalizing the Part 501 rules pending the expected enactmentof amendments to the Clean Water Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Water Quality Act of 1987 </ITAG>A. New Permit Program for Sludge Management Section 406 of the Water Quality Act of 1987 (WQA), which amends section405 of the Clean Water Act, sets forth for the first time a comprehensiveprogram for reducing the environmental risks and maximizing the beneficialuse of sludge. The basis of the program to protect public health and theenvironment from any adverse effects from sewage sludge is the developmentof technical regulations for sludge use and disposal, and the implementationof these requirements through permits. The WQA requires promulgation ofsludge standards establishing acceptable levels of toxic pollutants insewage sludge and management practices in two stages, discussed more fullybelow. After the technical standards have been promulgated, the amendments directthat any permit under section 402 of the Act (NPDES permits) issued toa POTW or any other treatment works treating domestic sewage shall includethe sludge technical standards, unless such requirements have been includedin a permit issued under subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, PartC of the Safe Drinking Water Act, MPRSA, or the Clean Air Act, or underState permit programs approved by the Administrator, where the Administratordetermines that such programs assure compliance with any applicable requirementsof section 405. Section 405(f)(1). The amendments further provide thatthe Administrator may issue separate permits that implement the sludgerequirements to treatment works which are not subject to section 402 ofthe Act (NPDES) or to any of the other listed permit programs or approvedState programs. Section 405(f)(2). Such permits are referred to in thispreamble discussion as ``sludge-only'' permits. The 1987 amendments give new direction for the regulation of sludge managementactivities on several fronts. First, section 405 now clearly requires thatNPDES permits contain conditions implementing the sludge technical standardsto be promulgated by the Agency, unless those standards have been includedin a permit issued under one of the listed Federal programs or under aState program approved for administering a section 405(f) sludge permittingprogram. Therefore, a State which seeks EPA approval to administer a sludgepermitting program may choose to regulate sludge through its NPDES programor through another permitting program (e.g., solid waste programs), aslong as the permit implements the sludge technical standards promulgatedunder section 405. Second, the amendments establish that the requirementto include conditions implementing the sludge technical standards in permitsapplies to any treatment works that treats domestic sewage. This expandsthe universe of treatment works that are required to obtain permits fromearlier draft amendments, which would have limited the permitting requirementto publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs) and treatment works that treatprimarily domestic sewage. In addition, the 1987 amendments authorize theAdministrator to issue permits to treatment works solely to implement thesludge technical standards even if the treatment works are not otherwiserequired to obtain NPDES permits. Another important change brought aboutby the 1987 amendments concerns the responsibility of users and disposersfor complying with the technical standards for sewage sludge. Prior tothe Water Quality Act, section 405(e) only required <T3>POTW</T3>s to use or dispose of sewage sludge in accordance with thetechnical standards. In the 1987 amendments to section 405(e), Congressextended this requirement to any person. The reason for this change isexplained in the legislative history:<ITAG tagnum="21">Section 405(e) is amended to expand the applicability of the 405(d)sludge use and disposal regulations to ``any person'' * * * The purposeof this * * * change is to impose the regulations on those that actuallydispose of the sludge, which may not be the treatment works' owner or operator.''U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Report No. 99-50,May 14, 1985.</ITAG>Section 405(e), as amended, now prohibits any person from using or disposingof sludge from a POTW or other treatment works for any use for which regulationshave been established except in accordance with such regulations. Thismeans that any person, regardless of whether or not they are required toobtain a permit, who uses or disposes of sludge by one of the practicesfor which technical standards have been established is required to complywith such standards.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Because section 405(f) requires treatment works treatingdomestic sewage to obtain permits that implement the technical standards,today's rule provides a definition of ``treatment works treating domesticsewage.'' This definition specifically excludes septic tanks and portabletoilets, which arguably could be considered treatment works, from its scope.EPA has excluded septic tanks and portable toilets from the permittingrequirement because Congress indicated its intent that the section 405technical standards apply only to septage treatment and processing, notgeneration. S. Rep. No. 99-50 on S. 1128 at 47 (1985). It follows thatif the standards apply only to treatment, and not generation, it wouldserve no useful purpose to require permits for the 22 million homeownerswith septic tanks or for portable toilets. However, because septic tankpumpings and portable toilet pumpings are within the definition of ``sewagesludge,'' use or disposal of these substances is regulated under 40 CFRPart 503. Disposers of septic tank and portable toilet pumpings must complywith applicable requirements of that Part.</ITAG>The 1987 amendments also strengthen the provisions for enforcing againstviolations of section 405 or of permits implementing regulations promulgatedunder section 405. Congress amended section 309(c) of the CWA to provide,for the first time, criminal penalties for negligent or knowing violationsof section 405 or permits implementing the requirements of section 405.The Administrator's new authority to assess administrative penalties forviolations of the CWA also covers violations of section 405 and implementingregulations and permits. Section 309(g). In addition, section 308 of the CWA, which establishes the Administrator'sauthority to require monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping, and to inspectand sample to determine compliance with the CWA, has been amended to specificallyreference section 405. (<T3>See </T3>section 308(a)(4), as amended by section 406(d) of the WQA.)Other provisions amended by section 406(d) of the WQA include section 505(f)(citizen suits for violations of regulations under section 405(d)) andsection 509(b)(1)(E) (judicial review of regulations promulgated undersection 405). B. Sludge Technical Standards (40 CFR Part 503) The key elements of the sludge permit program established by the 1987 amendmentsare the technical regulations for sewage sludge use and disposal. The CWAof 1977 directed EPA to develop regulations containing guidelines for theutilization and disposal of sewage sludge. The regulations were to: identifyuses for sewage sludge, including disposal; identify factors to be takeninto account in the use or disposal of sewage sludge; and specify concentrationsof pollutants which would interfere with sewage sludge use or disposal.The 1987 amendments imposed additional requirements: EPA is to identifytoxic pollutants which may be present in sewage sludge in concentrationsthat may adversely affect public health or the environment, and establishnumerical limits and management practices for those pollutants. CWA section405(d)(2). Where promulgation of numerical limits is infeasible, the regulationsmay specify a design, equipment, management practice or operational standard.CWA section 405(d)(3). The numerical limits and management practices areto protect public health and the environment from any reasonably anticipatedadverse effects of the pollutants. The Act provides for promulgation ofthe technical standards in two phases, with periodic review by EPA to determineif additional pollutants need to be regulated. C. Interim Implementation Strategy The 1987 amendments also provided for immediate regulation of sewage sludgeuse and disposal. Section 405(d)(4) provides that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Prior to the promulgation of the regulation required by (section 405(d)(2)),the Administrator shall impose conditions in permits issued to publiclyowned treatment works under section 402 of this Act or take such othermeasures as the Administrator deems appropriate to protect public healthand the environment from any adverse effects which may occur from toxicpollutants in sewage sludge.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In response to this directive, EPA has developed a ``Strategy forInterim Implementation of Sludge Requirements in Permits Issued to POTWs.''Under the Interim Strategy, EPA and the States have begun to include sludgerequirements in permits for POTWs as they are reissued. A few minimum conditionsare to be included in all POTW permits. Site-specific limits are to bedeveloped for ``priority POTWs,'' on a case-by-case basis using best professionaljudgment. To assist with developing interim limits, EPA recently publisheda draft ``Guidance for Writing Case-by-Case Permit Requirements for MunicipalSewage Sludge.'' Although the focus of the Interim Strategy is on POTWs,section 405(d)(4) gives EPA authority to take appropriate action to addressother sludge use or disposal problems. Until promulgation of the finalPart 503 technical standards, the Interim Strategy will be the mainstayof EPA's sludge management program. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. March 9, 1988 Proposed Rule </ITAG>EPA originally proposed Part 501, State sludge management program regulationsin February 1986, prior to the February 1987 amendments to the CWA. Becausethey were proposed before the 1987 CWA amendments, these proposed Part501 regulations did not require that States have a permitting program toimplement the sludge standards. As discussed above, this situation changedwith the Water Quality Act of 1987, which specified that EPA promulgatesludge technical standards and implement them either through an NPDES permit,or through a permit issued under one of the Federal permit programs listedunder amended section 405(f)(1), or through permits issued pursuant toan approved State sludge program. To implement this and other changes tosection 405 of the Clean Water Act, on March 9, 1988 EPA reproposed theFebruary 4, 1986 State sludge management program regulations and also proposedrevisions to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)regulations to integrate sludge controls into the NPDES permit program(53 FR 7642).The purpose of the March 9, 1988 proposal was to establish a national programfor sludge use and disposal under the authority of the Water Quality Actof 1987. It addressed permit requirements and procedures and State programrequirements, and contained four principal sections. First, revisions to40 CFR Part 122 were proposed to address when and how sewage sludge useand disposal would be regulated through NPDES permits. Second, revisionsto 40 CFR Part 123 were proposed to include requirements for States thatwish to implement an approved sludge management program as part of an NPDESprogram. Third, revisions to 40 CFR Part 124 were proposed to add proceduralrequirements for EPA-issued permits with sludge conditions. Finally, anew Part 501 was proposed to establish the requirements and submissionprocedures for approving State sludge management programs that are notpart of a State NPDES program. <ITAG tagnum="85">V. Discussion of Today's Final Rule and Response to Comments </ITAG>A.General: Purpose and Scope <ITAG tagnum="81">1. State and Federal Sludge Management Program </ITAG>Consistent with the directions set forth in the 1987 amendments to theCWA, today's final rule establishes the legal and programmatic frameworkfor a national program for sludge use and disposal. Today's final ruleestablishes the requirements and procedures for addressing sludge managementin permits issued by EPA or an approved State and State program requirementsand approval procedures. While most of today's rule addresses the long-termpermitting program to implement technical standards for sewage sludge useand disposal called for in section 405(f) of the CWA, it also codifiesvarious aspects of EPA's authority to take interim measures prior to thepromulgation of those standards to protect public health and the environmentfrom the adverse effects that may occur from toxic pollutants in sewagesludge. Two major considerations directed the development of today's final rule.First was the goal of developing a program which would encourage beneficialuse while ensuring the safe use and disposal of sewage sludge. Sewage sludgeshould be viewed as a resource rather than as a disposal problem. To accommodatethis goal, EPA has sought to develop permitting requirements and proceduresthat are compatible with beneficial reuse projects such as agriculturalland application. Second, EPA sought to encourage States to assume responsibilityfor implementing the sludge permitting program. This goal is consistentwith the general policy direction established in section 101(b) of theClean Water Act and reiterated by the Agency's Sludge Task Force. ManyStates have effective sludge management programs and today's final ruleattempts to minimize disruption to these programs, while ensuring minimumconsistency. Unlike the 1986 proposal, however, EPA will not rely exclusivelyon States for implementation of the Federal technical sludge standards.Where States do not have an approved program under Section 405, EPA willbe responsible for implementing the technical standards. In developing the final rule, EPA carefully considered public commentsreceived on both the February 1986 and March 1988 proposals. In total,EPA received 114 comments from 87 commenters. More than half (50) of alIcommenters were State agencies. EPA also received comments from 24 POTWsand municipalities, six industries and trade associations, three commercialsludge handlers, three environmental groups, and one commenter whose interestin the rulemaking was not identified. EPA's response to comments will beincluded as part of the discussion of the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Organization of Discussion </ITAG>The discussion of the final rule is organized to address three principalaspects of the new sewage sludge program: (1) Scope of the national program,(2) permitting requirements, and (3) State programs. The first topic coversissues that define who and what is regulated under the sludge program,and EPA's authority under section 405 of the Clean Water Act. The secondtopic covers requirements and procedures for regulating sludge use anddisposal through permits. This consists mainly of a section-by-sectiondiscussion of revisions to Parts 122 and 124, (which also are relevantto the permitting provisions in Part 501). Most issues discussed underthis topic concern both Federal and State permitting programs, althougha few issues are unique to the Federal program. The final topic addressesonly issues that involve minimum requirements for approvable State programsand the procedures for EPA approval, oversight, revision, and withdrawalof State sludge management programs. Discussions of each issue or regulatoryprovision will address the 1986 and the 1988 proposed rule (where applicable),public comments, the final rule and response to comments. B. Relationship Between Today's Final Rule and the Sludge Technical Regulations(Part 503) A major purpose of today's rulemaking is to establish the administrativeframework for implementing the technical standards for sewage sludge useand disposal required by section 405(d) of the CWA. As noted above, theAct requires promulgation of at least two rounds of technical standards.The first round of standards is now under development as part of a separaterulemaking, which will be codified at 40 CFR Part 503. EPA published theproposed rule for these standards on February 6, 1989 at 54 FR 5746. Allreferences to the technical or Part 503 standards or regulations in today'snotice refer to those standards in their final, not proposed, form. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Description of Part 503 </ITAG>The Part 503 regulations propose to establish technical standards onlyfor use and disposal of non-hazardous sewage sludge. Accordingly, the permittingprogram established by today's rulemaking applies only to the use or disposalof nonhazardous sludge. Sludges which are considered hazardous wastes underSubtitle C of RCRA in accordance with 40 CFR Part 261 will continue tobe managed under Subtitle C alone. Disposal of hazardous sludge in accordancewith the Subtitle C requirements will constitute compliance with section405. Likewise, sewage sludge found to contain greater than 50 parts permillion (ppm) of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) will continue to be regulatedunder 40 CFR Part 761, rather than Part 503. Ocean dumping of sewage sludge already is regulated under Title I of theMPRSA (33 U.S.C. 1401 <T3>et seq.</T3>), and the Agency has promulgated technical regulationsunder the MPRSA which govern this practice (40 CFR Parts 220 through 228).Ocean dumping of sewage sludge currently is limited to nine municipal authoritiesin the states of New York and New Jersey, and takes place at a site approximately106 miles offshore. Recent amendments to the MPRSA (Pub. L. 100-688) prohibitocean dumping of sewage sludge after December 31, 1991, and also prohibitany new dumpers from beginning this practice in the meantime. MPRSA sections104B(a) (1)(B) and (2). The MPRSA amendments further envisage that within270 days of the date of enactment (November 18, 1988), EPA is to enterinto compliance and enforcement agreements for the termination of oceandumping of sewage sludge and is to issue permits under the MPRSA to regulatethe existing ocean dumpers. MPRSA section 104B(a)(1)(A). Given the existenceof MPRSA technical regulations applicable to ocean dumping of sewage sludgeand the recent MPRSA amendments prohibiting ocean dumping of sewage sludgeafter December 31, 1991, EPA does not intend to embark on developing technicalregulations under Part 503 for the ocean dumping of sewage sludge.The proposed Part 503 standards include numerical limits on certain pollutantsthat may interfere with the safe use or disposal of sewage sludge (or equationsfor calculating those pollutant limits); management practices to minimizeadverse effects on public health and the environment from pollutants insludge; monitoring requirements (including methodologies); recordkeepingand reporting requirements; and other requirements that prescribe the levelof management control over sewage sludge. The standards focus on the ultimateuse or disposal of sewage sludge rather than on treatment processes. Insetting the standards, the Agency has taken into account the various waysthat a pollutant may reach an individual, plant, or animal, including,but not limited to, groundwater, surface water, air, and the food chain.The first round of the proposed Part 503 standards addresses the followinguse or disposal methods: land application (including various end uses suchas agriculture, silviculture, and land reclamation), distribution and marketingof sludge and sludge-derived products, disposal in sludge-only landfills(``monofills''), disposal on surface disposal sites (with residence timegreater than one year), and incineration in sludge-only incinerators. Inaddition, the disposal of sewage sludge in municipal solid waste landfillsthat accept other solid waste (``co-disposal landfills'' or ``MSWLFs'')will be governed by separate regulations promulgated under the joint authorityof Section 405 of the CWA and Subtitle D of RCRA. These regulations willbe codified at 40 CFR Part 258. (<T3>See </T3>53 FR 333l3, August 30, 1988) for the 40 CFR Part 258 proposedrule.) Therefore, references to Part 503 in today's rule include Part 258.The Regulatory Impact Analysis prepared for the Part 503 proposed ruleindicates that the most commonly used POTW sewage sludge method is disposalin MSWLFs. EPA estimates that 6,664 POTWs send 3,162,345 dry metric tons(DMTs) of sludge, or 41 percent of the total annual POTW sludge production,to MSWLFs. One hundred sixty-nine POTWs (operating 282 sewage sludge incineratorunits) incinerate 1,615,416 DMTs, or 21.4 percent, annually. Another 2,623POTWs land apply, to agricultural and non-agricultural lands, a total of1,202,158 DMTs, or 15.6 percent, of sewage sludge produced per year. Thereare 106 POTWs that distribute and market 705,485 DMTs, or 9.1 percent,of sewage sludge. Forty-nine POTWs dispose of 101,375 DMTs (1.3 percent)of sewage sludge in monofills. EPA estimates that approximately 2395 POTWsdispose l97,510 DMTs (2.6 percent) of sludge in surface disposal sites.Another 694,377 DMTs (9.0 percent) of sludge are disposed of by other means(including ocean dumping). Certain practices and sludges that fall within the purview of section 405are not covered in the first round of the Part 503 standards. As previouslymentioned, standards for sewage sludge disposed of in MSWLFs were developedas part of the RCRA Subtitle D proposal and will be codified in Part 258rather than Part 503. Similarly, the co-incineration of sewage sludge withother materials will not be covered, except possibly where the only othermaterial is a fuel. The Agency is studying how best to regulate facilitiesco-firing sewage sludge with municipal solid waste. (<T3>See, </T3>Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 52 FR 2599, July 7,1987.) Part 503 proposes to regulate the ultimate use or disposal of sewage sludge.Therefore, the proposed rule does not cover sludge placed in pits, ponds,lagoons, and similar surface impoundments which traditionally have beenconsidered either part of the wastewater treatment train or as temporarystorage facilities. Sludge placed in a surface impoundment for less thanone year is assumed to be part of the treatment train. On the other hand,sludge that is held for more than one year in a surface impoundment wouldbe regulated under the proposed Part 503 regulations because it is assumedthat after a year, the surface impoundment has become a disposal site.In addition, sludge that is physically removed from the treatment trainand does not reenter the treatment train will be regulated under the appropriateuse/disposal practice standard. For example, Part 503 does not proposeto regulate the sludge that accumulates in wastewater treatment lagoons(or the treatment lagoon itself), but if that sludge is removed from thewastewater treatment lagoon and applied to land, it would be regulatedunder the Part 503 land application requirements. Thus, the proposed Part503 regulations focus on ultimate disposal, i.e., when the sludge reentersthe environment. The first round of the Part 503 standards would apply to sewage sludgegenerated at POTWs and other treatment works treating domestic sewage,such as privately-owned sewage treatment plants. It would not apply, however,to sewage sludge generated or treated at industrial or commercial facilitieswhich treat domestic sewage with other wastewaters generated at the facility.(What constitutes ``domestic sewage'' and related issues are discussedmore fully below in section V.D.II.) Until the Agency collects additionalinformation on the characteristics of the sludge generated at such facilities,the sludge will continue to be regulated under rules promulgated underSubtitle D of RCRA as a nonhazardous solid waste (40 CFR Parts 257 and258), or under Subtitle C as a hazardous waste (40 CFR Parts 261 through268), as the case may be. EPA proposed in a separate rulemaking that industrialfacilities notify the States and EPA of the volume of their sludge andthe disposal methods and locations used (<T3>see </T3>53 FR 33313, August 30, 1988). Once these and other data (e.g.,viscosity, density, moisture content, and the organic carbon content ofindustrial sludge with a domestic sewage component) have been collected,the Agency will determine whether the Part 503 regulations should applyor whether additional regulations should be developed for industrial facilitiesthat co-treat domestic sewage with industrial wastewater. The Agency anticipatesthat any additional requirements for industrial facilities treating domesticsewage along with industrial waste and wastewater would be developed underthe joint authorities of sections 4004 and 4010 of RCRA and section 405(d)of the CWA.Neither today's final rule nor the proposed Part 258 or Part 503 rule affectthe status of existing federal regulations that apply to sewage sludgeuse and disposal, such as 40 CFR Part 257. Those requirements will remainin effect until specifically revised or rescinded by rulemaking. For example,the proposed Part 503 rule specifies that Part 257 will no longer applyto sewage sludge covered by the final Part 503 standards. Similarly, theproposed Part 258 rule, upon final promulgation, will remove the applicabilityof Part 257 to facilities covered by Part 258. However, until those rulemakingsare final, the 40 CFR Part 257 requirements will remain in effect and willbe implemented, where applicable, by means of the permit program establishedby today's rule. (Also see the discussion of EPA's ``Strategy for InterimImplementation of Sludge Requirements in Permits Issued to POTWs'' in sectionIII.C.) <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Timing</ITAG>Numerous commenters on both the 1986 and 1988 proposed rules opposed thepromulgation of State sludge management program rules (commonly referredto as ``Part 501'') in advance of the technical sludge regulations. Mostopposition came from States and focused on the difficulties of planningfor State sludge management programs (e.g., budget, legal authorities,organization) without knowing what the technical standards will require.For these reasons, several States expressed an unwillingness to committhemselves to seeking program approval until they knew more about the scopeand content of the Part 503 standards. Several commenters stated that theycould not comment intelligently on the Part 501 proposed rule in the absenceof the Part 503 standards. Two commenters even were concerned that promulgationof the Part 501 rules would foreclose opportunity to comment on the Part503 proposed rule. (In a related vein, one commenter said EPA should delayPart 501 until the ``Process to Significantly Reduce Pathogens'' (PSRP)standard is revised since the current requirement in 40 CFR Part 257 isunsound.) One commenter objected that this reversed the sequence of theUIC, NPDES, and RCRA programs. Another commenter stated that it would bemore logical to ``delegate'' State programs after promulgation of Part503 since Part 503 will probably result in changes to pretreatment standardsas well. Finally, one commenter asserted that Congress did not intend thatEPA promulgate Part 501 until after promulgation of Part 503. EPA is promulgating a final rule for State sludge management programs andpermitting requirements before final promulgation of the Part 503 technicalstandards. The 1987 amendments called for promulgation of State programapproval procedures by December 15, 1986, nearly nine months before thefirst round of technical regulations were to be promulgated. Therefore,EPA disagrees that Congress intended that promulgation of the Part 501regulation occur after promulgation of the technical standards. In addition,while EPA does not dispute all of the reasons advanced in opposition tothis approach, the need to go forward with today's final rule outweighsthe advantages in delaying promulgation for several reasons. First, although today's final rule is closely related to the sludge technicalstandards, it is not dependent on it. Today's rule addresses primarilyprocedural and programmatic issues, which are unaffected by the technicalstandards. (Similarly, any revision of categorical or other pretreatmentstandards as a result of the promulgation of sludge standards can proceedindependently of today's final rule. The relationship between the sludgeand pretreatment programs is explained more fully in section V.I.1. ofthis preamble.) EPA recognizes that the full impact of the sludge permittingprogram under Section 405 will not be known until promulgation of the sludgetechnical standards. This will always be the case, since the CWA callsfor subsequent rounds of technical standards which may impose new requirementsand update old standards. Contrary to the comment that this reverses thesequence of other federal environmental permitting programs, the same wasand is true in the NPDES and pretreatment programs, where the technicalstandards implemented through those programs were promulgated in numerous,separate rulemakings over a 15-year period. Significantly, nearly all theeffluent guidelines for the NPDES program were promulgated after promulgationof the State program and permitting requirements. Since the process ofpromulgating technical standards is an ongoing one, delaying the Stateprogram and permitting requirement regulations merely delays implementationof the program. This would be contrary to clear Congressional intent. Second, quick and effective implementation of the technical standards oncepromulgated will depend on having the administrative aspects of the permittingprogram in place. This is particularly critical for State programs. EPAwill be responsible for issuing permits that implement the standards inthe absence of approved State programs. State programs cannot be approvedbefore promulgation of State program regulations. Therefore, EPA intendsto strongly encourage States to seek program approval as soon as possibleso as not to disrupt those programs and create a dual permitting schemeupon promulgation of the technical standards. EPA recognizes that States may not be able to determine whether programapproval is feasible or desirable until they know the contents of the Part503 standards. Under today's rule, State programs are not mandatory (asthey would have been under the 1986 proposed Part 501), so promulgationof today's rule will not impose the unknown upon States as many seem tofear. In addition, the technical standards in proposed form were made publiclyavailable at about the same time as promulgation of the State program rules.Therefore, States will not have to make decisions about seeking programapproval in the total absence of any information as to the scope and contentof the technical sludge standards. In addition, waiting until promulgationof the Part 503 standards before promulgating the State program regulationswould unnecessarily delay approval of programs in States that are willingto go forward despite uncertainties about Part 503. Today's promulgation of a final rule that establishes State program andpermitting requirements and procedures does not in any way affect the opportunityto comment on the Part 503 proposed rule. This will include an opportunityto comment on pathogen reduction requirements. Therefore, the commenters'concerns that promulgation of the Part 501 regulations would foreclosetheir opportunity to comment on the technical regulations is unfounded.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Part 503 Issues Raised in Comments </ITAG>Although the Part 503 technical standards will be the subject of a separaterulemaking, several commenters raised issues related to technical standards.These comments are briefly addressed below. Any final decisions regardingissues related to the technical standards will be resolved in the contextof the Part 503 rulemaking.Several commenters, mostly POTWs, commented that the deadlines for compliancewith technical standards (within one year after promulgation; two yearsif the regulations require major construction) are unrealistic and unreasonable.Since these compliance deadlines are established by statute, EPA cannotdisregard them in regulations. A few commenters urged that the Part 503 technical standards be issuedas guidance rather than as regulations so that implementation of the standardswould be flexible and take into account regional variations. In contrast,another commenter stressed the need for legally binding regulations toassure adequate protection of public health and the environment even thoughneeds of industry might conflict. Again, the Clean Water Act does not give the Agency much discretion inthis matter. Section 405(d) requires promulgation of regulations. Section405(e) makes those regulations directly enforceable against any personwho uses or disposes of sewage sludge in a manner inconsistent with theprovisions of the regulations. However, because the technical standardswill be regulations, rather than non-binding guidance, does not mean theywill be inflexible. In fact, the proposed Part 503 standards have beenstructured to take into account variations in the local environment andthe different risks posed by the various use and disposal practices. Several States requested that the regulations allow variances from thePart 503 standards for research and demonstration projects. Accountingfor site-specific variations will be allowed in certain circumstances,but only within the Part 503 regulatory framework, as those rules willbe designed to ensure protection of public health and the environment asrequired by the statute. There are no acceptable deviations from this standardand any method of sludge use and disposal must conform to this requirement.Concerns about the appropriateness of a particular standard are properlyaddressed during public comment on the proposed Part 503 rulemaking. C. Relationship to Other Programs The establishment of a new sludge permitting program in today's final ruledoes not supplant other existing, federal environmental programs that mayhave a direct or indirect bearing on sewage sludge use or disposal. Instead,the new sludge permitting program will provide a mechanism for implementingfederal technical requirements and filling in gaps left by other mediaspecific regulatory programs. The role of integrating cross-media environmentalconcerns and technical standards under the various existing programs willbe fulfilled primarily by the sludge technical standards. For example,the Agency has adopted a Ground Water Protection Strategy which includesGuidelines for Ground-Water Classification. This classification dividesground water into three classes: Class I_Special ground waters that arehighly vulnerable, ecologically vital or irreplaceable as a drinking watersource; Class II_current or potential sources of drinking water; and ClassIII_ground waters not a source of drinking water and of limited beneficialuse. Requirements for sludge applied over a Class I irreplaceable sourcemay well be more stringent than for sludge applied over a Class III groundwater which is not a drinking water source and has limited beneficial use.D. Regulated Universe This section discusses who and what is to be regulated under section 405and how they are to be regulated. Much of the discussion consists of definingkey terms. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Sewage sludge </ITAG>The proposed rules defined sewage sludge to mean ``any solid, semi-solid,or liquid residue which contains materials removed from municipal or domesticwastewater during treatment, including primary and secondary solids, septage.and portable toilet waste.'' The definition did not include grit, screenings,scum, or sewage sludge incinerator ash, as explained in the preamble tothe 1986 proposal, because of the relatively small volumes, different characteristics,limited management practices, and general lack of public exposure to thesematerials. In the 1986 proposal, EPA specifically solicited comments onthis point. EPA received over 25 comments on various aspects of the sewage sludge definitionin response to the 1986 proposal and approximately 15 comments in responseto the 1988 proposal. Commenters focussed on two major issues: (1) Whetherthe definition should include grit, screenings, scum or ash; and (2) whetherseptage should be included in the definition. In addition, commenters raisedvarious other questions about the definition of sewage sludge (such asthe inclusion of portable toilet wastes and sludge-derived products) aswell as the definition of septage. Today's final rule defines ``sewage sludge'' to mean ``any solid, semi-solid,or liquid residue removed during the treatment of municipal wastewateror domestic sewage. Sewage sludge includes, but is not limited to, solidsremoved during primary, secondary, or advanced waste water treatment, scum,septage, portable toilet pumpings, type III marine sanitation device pumpings(33 CFR Part 159), and sewage sludge products. Sewage sludge does not includegrit or screenings, or ash generated during the incineration of sewagesludge.'' In addition to the reasons discussed below, today's definitionof ``sewage sludge'' is designed to be consistent with the approach proposedin the Part 503 technical standards. <T3>Grit, screenings, scum, and ash</T3>. The definition of sewage sludgein the final rule is the same as the proposed rule in that it excludesgrit, screenings, and the ash generated during incineration of sewage sludge,primarily for the reasons stated in the preamble to the 1986 proposal.For purposes of clarification, today's definition of sewage sludge specificallyexcludes these materials. These materials are still considered to be solidwastes and will continue to be regulated as such under RCRA. Today's definitionof sewage sludge differs from the 1986 and 1988 proposed rules, however,by including scum in the definition of sewage sludge. Today's final definitionalso includes minor editorial changes to specify that it includes residuesfrom advanced wastewater treatment (as well as from primary and secondarytreatment). Nearly all commenters on the issue (17 State agencies and 8 POTWs or municipalities)supported EPA's decision to exclude grit and screenings from the definitionof sewage sludge. Screenings are relatively large pieces of solid materialthat are caught on screens at the headworks of the treatment plant. Gritis the material that settles out before primary treatment such as sand,small pebbles, and similar material. In addition to the reasons cited byEPA in the preamble, commenters favored exclusion of these materials becausethey were being adequately regulated under existing State programs, theadditional administrative burden of regulating them would not be justifiedby environmental results, and exclusion of grit and screenings from thesewage sludge program would encourage public acceptance of land-based managementoptions for sewage sludge from POTWs. In response to the original proposal, five commenters favored regulatinggrit and screenings under sewage sludge management programs. Two Statessaid they should be included because they could be adequately regulatedunder the Part 501 sewage sludge management programs (one noting that thesematerials should not be forgotten). One POTW favored regulating these materialsunder the sewage sludge program as an alternative to regulating them undera separate program. Another POTW said they should be included because theyare mixed, and therefore disposed of, with sewage sludge. EPA agrees with the commenters that favor excluding grit and screeningsfrom the definition of sewage sludge. These commenters confirmed EPA'srationale that these wastestreams are small (in one case, comprising onlyone percent of all wastestreams ``generated'' at the treatment plant),that they have vastly different properties from sewage sludge generatedduring wastewater treatment, that they are usually separately handled anddisposed of, and are adequately regulated under solid waste programs. Becausegrit and screening are already regulated as solid wastes under subtitleD of RCRA, EPA disagrees that regulating these materials separately fromthe sewage sludge program would require duplication of effort. EPA neitheragrees nor disagrees with the commenter who favored including grit andscreenings in the definition of sewage sludge because they are mixed anddisposed of with sewage sludge. The evidence suggests that grit and screeningsare more likely to be handled separately from sewage sludge, which is amajor reason for not including them in the definition of sewage sludge.If however, these materials are mixed with sewage sludge and then disposed,they would be considered sewage sludge under today's definition (as a sewagesludge product). Most commenters who favored excluding grit and screenings from the definitionof sewage sludge also favored excluding scum from the definition. Scumis the material that floats upward and must be skimmed off the top of thewastewater treatment tanks. The fate of scum is more varied. Several commenterssaid it is handled the same as grit and screenings. As noted by one commenter,it can be concentrated and returned to sludge digesters. Sometimes it ismixed and disposed of with the primary sludge. However, unlike grit andscreenings, scum shares many characteristics with the other residues generatedduring waste water treatment and is typically disposed of with other sewagesludge. Therefore, it is being included in the definition of sewage sludge.The ash generated during incineration of sewage sludge is not includedin today's definition of sewage sludge. Again, most commenters favoredexclusion of ash from the definitions for the reasons EPA gave in the preambleto the 1986 proposed rule. However, in response to that original proposal,two States argued that the large volume of incinerator ash justified regulationunder the sewage sludge program. One POTW favored regulating ash undera sewage sludge program as a means of coordinating regulation of POTWsunder one program. While the amount of sludge incinerator ash comparedto other sewage sludge may be relatively high at POTWs which incineratesludge, overall the amount of incinerator ash still appears to be relativelysmall. More importantly, as one commenter noted, incinerator ash is likeother ash material (sterile and dry), and not like sludge. Accordingly,like other ash, it is typically disposed of in landfills, and consequentlyis regulated under existing solid waste programs. Consolidating regulationof POTWs under one program is a desirable goal but does not provide technicaljustification for treating incinerator ash the same as sewage sludge. Sewage sludge incinerator ash is a solid waste and therefore, the Agencywill continue to regulate it like other solid wastes (and other incineratorashes) under RCRA (i.e., under Subtitle D if it is non-hazardous and underSubtitle C if it constitutes a hazardous waste). If, however, incineratorash is mixed and disposed of with sewage sludge (for example, in land application),it will be regulated as sewage sludge. Two States expressed a middle position on the question of whether grit,screenings, and ash should be regulated under the sewage sludge program,stating that some degree of monitoring and reporting of these materialswas necessary, but extensive procedures should not be required. This approachis consistent with the Agency's decision not to regulate these materialsunder the sewage sludge management program, but rather to continue to regulatethem under solid waste program requirements. Moreover, today's final ruledoes not preclude States from regulating grit, screenings, and ash as stringentlyas they think appropriate under State programs. <T3>Septage. </T3>Public comments on the issue of including septage inthe definition of sewage sludge were more divided. Supporters of the proposeddefinition, which would include septage in the definition of sewage sludge,included States, POTWs, and one environmental group. The most common reasongiven was that septage is a significant source of domestic sewage treatmentwaste and therefore needed to be addressed under the sewage sludge program.In a similar vein, one commenter noted that septage should be includedbecause it is a residual of sewage treatment like other sewage sludge.Several commenters who supported covering septage addressed only septagethat was discharged to POTWs, noting that regulation of septage shouldor could be an integral part of a pretreatment program. More commenters opposed including septage in the definition of sewage sludgethan favored it. Most opposition came from States. Some simply disagreedwith EPA's reasoning that septage exhibits similar properties as sewagesludge and requires similar constraints on its use and disposal. In manycases, opposition centered on the different regulatory approach many Statesused to regulate septage and the significant number of small entities potentiallywithin the scope of such a program, particularly as balanced against theenvironmental benefit of regulating a relatively small amount of material.Other commenters objected because septage regulation historically has beenthe concern of local health authorities. Under today's final rule, septage will be considered sewage sludge, justas it has been under preexisting federal regulations. However, as statedin the preamble to the proposed rule, only septage that is used or disposedof by one of the use or disposal methods regulated under the Part 503 regulationswill be regulated under the Section 405 sludge management program. (EPA,however, retains authority under section 405(d)(4) to take appropriateaction to protect public health and the environment in the absence of Part503 regulations. See discussion in section V.E. below.) Thus, septage thatis applied to land will be considered a part of the sludge management program.Septage that is discharged or hauled to POTWs is not covered by today'sprogram (although it may be subject to the POTW's pretreatment program)because there are no Part 503 standards planned at this time for this disposalpractice. However, such septage will be regulated indirectly under thePart 503 program through requirements on the use or disposal of the sludgegenerated by the POTW (which would be derived from septage and any othermaterial introduced into and consequently removed by the treatment works).Also, for those septage and portable toilet wastes introduced into thePOTW, EPA expects the POTW to exercise its pretreatment program authoritiesto verify the source and composition of the wastes, and the compatibilityof the wastes to ensure NPDES permit compliance.EPA recognizes that certain differences exist between sewage sludge generatedat POTWs and other treatment works and the residues pumped from septictanks. However, they pose similar threats to the environment when disposedimproperly. EPA proposed in Part 503 that the requirements for the useand disposal of sewage sludge also apply to septage. Thus, including septagewithin the scope of today's rulemaking is appropriate. This does not meanthat EPA intends to regulate septage through permits issued to the generators(i.e., the owners and operators of septic tanks) as will be the case withPOTW sewage sludge. As explained below, the definition of ``treatment workstreating domestic sewage'' specifically excludes septic tanks. In today's final rule, septage is separately defined. (Under the proposedrule septage was separately defined under Part 501 but not under Part 122.)The final rule also includes several minor changes to the definition of``septage'', made in response to comments. First, ``holding tanks'' hasbeen added as a receptacle in which septage can be found. Although theyserve a different purpose from septic tanks (collecting and holding sewagerather than treating it), the residues that accumulate at the bottom ofholding tanks are similar to the accumulated residues from septic tanks.The change to the proposed rule clarifies EPA's intent to treat the septagefrom both types of tanks the same. Second, the words ``or maintained'' have been added to the end of the definitionof ``septage.'' This is in response to a comment that the word ``cleaned''is ambiguous and that ``maintained'' would be clearer. EPA intends thesettled material in septic tanks and similar receptacles which is removedfor any reason be covered by the definition. Therefore, both words havebeen used in the definition to ensure that the definition is read broadly.EPA did not amend the definition of septage to include ``similar aerobicand anaerobic material.'' This suggested addition came from a commenterwho was concerned that pumped out material from small domestic aerobicpackage plants which do not have sludge storage tanks might be excludedunder the proposed definition. It is not necessary to specifically includethis material because, like sewage sludge generated at most POTWs, it clearlyfalls under the definition of sewage sludge as a ``residue removed duringthe treatment of municipal wastewater or domestic sewage.'' <T3>Portable toilet wastes. </T3>The proposed definition of sewage sludgeincluded ``portable toilet wastes.'' Today's final rule is the same inthis regard. In addition, the final definition specifies that pumpingsfrom Type III marine sanitation devices (as defined in 33 CFR Part 159)are included (when brought to shore for disposal). These pumpings are includedbecause they are often applied to land and present some of the same environmentaland health concerns as other sewage residues applied to land (e.g., thepotential for ground and surface water contamination, pathogens). EPA received several comments specifically addressing portable toilet pumpings.One commenter supported including portable toilet wastes because, amongother reasons, the chemicals sometimes used for treatment could be of concern.Other commenters, however, stated that portable toilet wastes were fundamentallydifferent from treatment plant sludge because they are raw, untreated sewageand therefore should not be included. EPA disagrees. As noted by the othercommenter, these wastes are sometimes chemically treated. In any case,lack of treatment is a reason for including, rather than excluding, thesematerials to ensure that reintroducing them to the environment does notthreaten public health or the environment. Like septage, however, portabletoilet pumpings taken to POTWs for treatment (rather than directly re-enteringthe environment) are not covered under the sewage sludge program exceptas a component of the sludge generated at the POTW or other treatment works.Likewise, portable toilets or Type III marine sanitation devices, likeseptic tanks, are not ``treatment works treating domestic sewage'' andowners or operators would not be required to obtain a permit. One commenter asked that EPA clarify whether pumpings from vault latrines,like those used in recreational areas and roadside restrooms, are withinthe scope of the regulations. Although these facilities seem to be immobilerather than portable, the wastes collected in them are similar to portabletoilet wastes. Therefore, they would be handled the same under today'sfinal rule, i.e., they are not covered by the sludge program if they areintroduced into a POTW, but they are covered by the sludge program if theyare used or disposed of by a method regulated under Part 503. One commenter asked EPA to define portable toilet wastes to exclude moveabletoilets such as those on trains, buses, airplanes, and private recreationvehicles. The final rule does not adopt this suggested change. The pumpingsfrom these facilities are no different than those from other portable toilets.However, as noted above, although the collected wastes will be subjectto the technical standards (and thus must be regulated under a State'sprogram), the owners and operators of the portable toilets are not requiredto obtain a permit under today's final rule. <T3>Sludge-derived products. </T3>The proposed definition of sewage sludgedid not distinguish between sludge in its original form and sludge thathas been somehow processed or altered for purposes of creating a marketableproduct. EPA received comments questioning whether the definition wouldor should include sludge that has been composted or sludge that has been``high-heat dried.'' To clarify the intended scope of the definition, thefinal definition specifically states that sewage sludge includes sewagesludge products. A sewage sludge product is any mixture of sewage sludgeand other material. One commenter expressed concern that unless sewage sludge compost was consideredsewage sludge and therefore governed by the regulations, potentially harmfulmaterial could escape regulation. (A related comment that composted sludgeshould be regulated like other sludge, unless contaminant levels have beenreduced below a certain level, is addressed below.) EPA shares this concern,and therefore, composted sewage sludge will be regulated. The potentialrisks posed by pollutants in sewage sludge do not necessarily disappearbecause the sludge has been mixed with other materials or undergone certaintreatment.Another commenter argued that its sludge, which has been ``high-heat dried''and packaged should be excluded from the definition of sewage sludge becauseit does not present the risks that were of concern to Congress (i.e., oceandumping, incineration) when it enacted section 405. In fact, the argumentcontinues, ``high-heat dried'' sludge reduces the need for landfills, incinerators,and ocean dumping and therefore exempting it from the new sludge permittingprogram would advance Congressional goals and the public interest. EPA disagrees. Congress may have highlighted concerns about particularsewage sludge disposal methods, but it did not specifically exclude anypractice or limit section 405 to any particular group of practices. Instead,it directed EPA to identify the uses, including disposal, that should beregulated. Moreover, as noted above, some pollutants in sewage sludge maycontinue to be of concern (for example, heavy metals) even though the sludgehas undergone various processes or has been mixed with other materials.Further, while heat treatment may be effective in reducing or eliminatingpathogen concerns, toxicity problems with the sludge may remain. Therefore,EPA has determined that it is necessary to regulate sludge-derived products.<T3>Other. </T3>One commenter said that the regulation of sewage sludgeunder the Part 501 and Part 503 rules would conflict with existing regulations(i.e., 40 CFR Part 257) that define sewage sludge as a solid waste. Congressclearly intended EPA to develop new regulations that specifically focuson sewage sludge use and disposal. Therefore, the existence of existingregulations governing sewage sludge is not an obstacle to new regulations.The Part 503 rulemaking will delineate the scope and coverage of the Part503 regulations, and propose revisions to 40 CFR Part 257 to exclude fromcoverage of Part 257 that sewage sludge regulated under Part 503. Thiswill eliminate duplicate regulation of sewage sludge. One commenter requested that sewage sludge be defined to include only sewagesludge generated by POTWs since (1) many State programs regulate only POTWsludge; and (2) this is the only sludge likely to be covered by the firstround of technical standards. Another commenter on the earlier proposalmade a similar suggestion based on resource concerns. Limiting the definitionas suggested would be contrary to the plain meaning of the statute andCongressional intent. While it may have been possible to argue that onlyPOTW sludge should be regulated under section 405 before the 1987 amendments,Congress foreclosed that option by requiring that the same sludge technicalstandards apply to sludge from POTWs and from other treatment works treatingdomestic sewage, and by prohibiting the use and disposal of sludge generatedby these facilities except in accordance with the technical standards.How soon treatment works treating domestic sewage will be subject to thePart 503 technical standards is a separate question. Contrary to the commenter'sassumption, the first round of Part 503 technical standards is proposedto cover more than POTW sludge and will apply to all sludge generated attreatment works treating domestic sewage (see discussion of ``domesticsewage'' below), except those facilities treating domestic sewage alongwith process wastewater. Therefore, the first round of Part 503 will coversewage sludge from privately owned treatment works. Consequently, undersection 405(f) of the CWA, EPA will require that permits issued to privately-ownedtreatment works implement the Part 503 technical standards. However, asdiscussed below, facilities not covered by the first round of the technicalstandards may not have to be permitted until standards applicable to themhave been promulgated. This will allow phased-in regulation, and thus alleviateconcerns about the immediate resource demands that an expanded programwould create for some States. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. POTWs and Other Treatment Works Treating Domestic Sewage.</ITAG>The requirement to include conditions in permits to implement the Part503 technical standards under section 405(f) of the CWA applies to POTWsand ``any other treatment works treating domestic sewage.'' Since theseterms define the core of the basic permitting program, they generated numerouscomments. EPA has thoroughly considered these comments, as well as thelegislative history, in developing a final definition which best addressesthe goals of section 405 and establishes a workable and effective permittingprogram. This has resulted in some changes from the proposed rule, as explainedbelow.<T3>Treatment works</T3>. The 1986 and 1988 proposals contained a definitionof the ``treatment works'' derived from Section 212 of the Clean WaterAct. It was defined to mean ``any devices and systems used in the collection,storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of municipal sewage wasteof a liquid nature, including land dedicated for the storage, treatmentand disposal of sewage and resulting sludge.'' This broadly worded definitionwas designed for purposes of the construction grant program, principallyto designate the type of projects potentially eligible for federal funding.``Treatment works'' as used in section 405(f), however, serves a much differentpurpose, that is, to define entities which are required to obtain permitsthat implement the technical sludge standards promulgated under section405(d). There were numerous commenters who apparently assumed that eachprocess, piece of equipment, or land that came into contact with sewageor sewage sludge would be subject to separate permits. This is absolutely<T3>not</T3> the case; the definition is inclusive to make it clear thatthese devices are all part of the overall system. In most cases, one permitwould be issued to the facility, covering the devices and systems usedto collect, store, treat, recycle and reclaim sewage and sewage sludge.Today's final rule adopts the proposed definition of ``treatment works.''However, it is now referred to as ``treatment works treating domestic sewage''to clearly identify treatment works subject to regulation under section405(f) of the CWA, which may or may not fall within the definition of ``treatmentworks'' as used in other programs such as NPDES and pretreatment. The basicpurpose of this definition is to include facilities that generate sewagesludge or otherwise effectively control the quality of sewage sludge orthe manner in which it is disposed (and hence its effect on the environment).This definition includes facilities that treat sewage sludge such as incinerators.The definition of ``treatment works treating domestic sewage'' in today'sfinal rule encompasses facilities that may process sewage sludge as woulda generator, but that are separate from the generator's facilities. Thus,``treatment works'' includes, for example, commercial sludge handlers whichprocess sewage sludge from POTWs for distribution and sale. (It would not,however, include a commercial handler which distributes the sludge butdoes not alter the sludge before distribution.) These are the facilitiesfor which permits are needed to effectively implement the technical sludgestandards now under development. Permits will be issued to owners or operatorsof disposal facilities such as monofills, dedicated land disposal sites,and surface disposal sites, as these are ``lands dedicated to the disposalof sewage sludge.'' However, under the Federal program, permits will notbe  required for owners or operators of land where sludge is beneficiallyreused such as farm lands and home gardens. Part 122 contains a second part to the definition of ``treatment workstreating domestic sewage.'' It provides that the Regional Administratormay designate a particular facility as a ``treatment works treating domesticsewage'' for the purpose of CWA section 405(f) where necessary to protectpublic health and the environment from poor sludge quality, use, handlingor disposal practices, or to ensure compliance with 40 CFR Part 503. Thisenables the Regional Administrator to carry out the intent of Congressto ensure that all persons subject to the standards for sludge use anddisposal (e.g., persons who handle sewage sludge but who do not generateor treat sewage sludge) operate in compliance with such standards, andthat adverse effects on the environment resulting from poor sludge quality,use, handling or disposal can be minimized. The authority to designatefacilities as ``treatment works treating domestic sewage'' on a case-by-casebasis is not required for either NPDES (Part 123) or non-NPDES (Part 501)State programs. Under today's final rule, States are required to have aprogram that requires permits for POTWs and other treatment works as definedin andSection; 501.2, but are free to develop any appropriate program toregulate other users and disposers of sewage sludge to ensure compliancewith the technical standards. <T3>Septage treatment and disposal systems</T3>. As discussed above, thedefinition of sewage sludge includes ``septage,'' the residues pumped fromseptic tanks during cleaning or maintenance. When Congress first consideredexpanding section 405 beyond POTWs to also cover treatment works treatingprimarily domestic sewage, its intent, in part, was to make the section405(d) standards applicable to ``septage treatment and disposal systems.''(Sen. Rep. No. 99-50 on S. 1128 at 47 (1985)). EPA reads this languageto refer to facilities where septage is collected for treatment prior todisposal (e.g., centralized septage treatment works such as lime stabilizationunits). Under today's final rule, only ``septage treatment and disposal systems''_notindividual septic tanks_are considered treatment works treating domesticsewage and thus will be required to obtain permits after promulgation ofapplicable Part 503 technical standards. Permits are only required if theseptage will be disposed of by one of the practices covered by 40 CFR Part503. EPA estimates that approximately one-third of all septage is takento POTWs for further treatment or mixture with the POTW's sludge. In fact,some States require that septage be taken to POTWs. As explained above,this practice will not be separately covered by 40 CFR Part 503. Instead,this septage would be regulated as a component of the POTW's or other treatmentworks' sludge. Individual septic tanks are not considered ``septage treatment and disposalsystems'' under today's final rule. To clarify this intent, the final definitionspecifically excludes septic tanks from the definition of ``treatment workstreating domestic sewage.'' EPA never intended to require permits for individualseptic tanks, as reflected in the proposed rule by the specific exclusionof individual household septic tanks from the definition of ``generator''(and, by reference, from the definition of ``treatment works''). Accordingto the 1980 census data, nearly 22 million households are served by septictanks. To regulate individual septic tanks (whether serving one or severalhouseholds) obviously would be extremely difficult and inefficient. Itwould also be impractical in terms of achieving environmental results sincethe owners and operators of septic tanks have no effective control overthe actual disposition of septage pumped from their tanks (i.e., they cannotcontrol the entities who pump and dispose of the septage). Septage pumpers and haulers are not considered ``treatment works treatingdomestic sewage'' or ``septage treatment and disposal systems'' under today'sfinal rule. Accordingly, these pumpers and haulers (and those who pumpother sewage residues from portable toilets, Type III marine sanitationdevices, and similar devices) are not required to obtain permits undersection 405(f) of the CWA and today's final rule. Pumpers and haulers areconsidered ``users and disposers'' of sewage sludge, however, and thereforewill be subject to the Part 503 regulations. See section 405(e) of theCWA. (See discussion of section 405(e) of the CWA, section III.A. above.)<T3>Domestic sewage</T3>. Before the 1987 amendments, section 405(d) ofthe CWA applied only to ``POTWs.'' The preamble to the February 1986 Part501 proposal explained EPA's interpretation:<ITAG tagnum="21">EPA believes that section 405 of the CWA was intended to regulatesludges that derive from (POTWs) or other treatment works that treat <T3>primarily </T3>domestic sewage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, neither the Part 501 regulations nor the Part 503 regulationswill apply to privately owned treatment works operated in conjunction withindustrial manufacturing and processing facilities. Such sludges are, however,regulated by EPA under the authority of RCRA.'' (51 FR 4459, February 4,1986). (Emphasis added.)</ITAG>Most commenters on the 1986 proposal (21 of 26) supported regulating sewagesludge from privately-owned treatment works that treat primarily domesticsewage the same as that from POTWs. The few commenters who opposed thisposition were concerned about resource burdens of regulating these facilitiesor questioned EPA's legal authority to regulate privately-owned treatmentworks. In the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act, Congress expanded the universeof entities requiring a permit to include any treatment works treatingdomestic sewage, without qualification as to the amount of domestic sewagein the treatment works' total flow. The intended effect of the change inlanguage, according to the legislative history, was to include what previouslyhad been excluded, i.e., privately-owned treatment works operated in conjunctionwith industrial manufacturing and processing facilities that treat domesticsewage. <T3>See </T3>Conf. Rep. No. 99-1004, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986) at 160.Accordingly, in the 1988 proposed rule, EPA included a permit requirementfor ``POTWs and any other treatment works that treat domestic sewage.''Neither the Act nor the proposed rule defined ``domestic sewage,'' however.This omission resulted in comments from industries and industry trade associationsurging EPA to define ``domestic sewage'' in such a way as to exclude industrialtreatment works that treat site-generated sanitary sewage. Two States alsoasked EPA to clarify what is meant by ``domestic sewage'' and how it expectedindustrial sludges to be regulated. Today's rule defines ``domestic sewage'' (for purposes of defining ``treatmentworks treating domestic sewage'') to mean ``waste and waste water fromhumans or household operations that are discharged to or otherwise entera treatment works.'' Thus, any treatment works which treats, in whole orin part, human-generated or household type wastes as part of its wastewater treatment is within the purview of section 405(f) and the requirementto obtain a permit that implements applicable Part 503 standards. Thisincludes industrial treatment works that treat site-generated sanitarywastes along with process or other wastes generated at the site. It doesnot however, apply to treatment works that generate sludges which constitutehazardous waste. As previously indicated, for purposes of section 405 regulation,requirements for sludges that fall within the definition of ``hazardouswaste'' (40 CFR 261.3), regardless of their source, will continue to bethose established under Subtitle C of RCRA. Although industrial treatment works that treat domestic sewage and generatenon-hazardous sludge will be regulated under section 405(f) of the CWAand today's final rule, the Agency does not plan at this time to coverthese facilities in the first round of the Part 503 technical standards.EPA does not yet have sufficient information on these sludges to promulgatestandards. Under the March 1988 proposed rule, permit conditions controllingsludge use and disposal from these facilities would have been developedon a case-by-case basis using ``best professional judgment.'' EPA has determinedthat because so little is known about the sludges generated at these facilities(as compared to the data base for sludges from treatment works treatingprimarily domestic sewage) and because there are potentially thousandsof facilities in this category, it is very difficult to find a defensibletechnical basis for routine case-by-case permitting of these facilities.Because these sludges are subject to regulation under RCRA, it is not clearthat pursuing case-by-case permitting now rather than after applicabletechnical standards have been developed would result in significantly greaterenvironmental benefits. Accordingly, under today's rule, these facilitieswill not be required to obtain permits under the sewage sludge programestablished by today's rule until EPA promulgates technical regulationsapplicable to the sewage sludge generated at such works, unless EPA determinesthat a permit or other measure is appropriate in a particular instanceto ``protect public health and the environment from any adverse effectswhich may occur from toxic pollutants in sewage sludge'' pursuant to section405(d)(4) of the CWA. Disposal of sludge from these facilities also willcontinue to be regulated under RCRA. As discussed in section V. B. of thispreamble, the Agency is gathering additional information about the sludgesfrom industrial facilities to determine whether additional regulation shouldbe pursued. One commenter asked whether coverage of industrial treatmentworks treating domestic sewage under section 405(f) would mean that thesludge disposal options available to domestic treatment works are alsoaccessible to industry. Generally, the availability of disposal optionswill be determined by whether the sludge constituents and the manner inwhich the sludge is used or disposed meet the technical requirements inPart 503. However, as noted above, until more data on industrial sludgeswith a domestic sewage component is gathered and analyzed, the Agency isnot in a position to say whether those sludges can be used or disposedof in the same manner as other sewage sludge. In the meantime, the useand disposal of industrial sludges will continue to be regulated underexisting federal regulations (e.g., Subtitle D of RCRA for land applicationand landfilling of non-hazardous sludge; Subtitle C of RCRA for sludgeconstituting a hazardous waste). Commenters who said that industrial facilities should be excluded fromregulation under section 405(f) advanced several different reasons fortheir position: (1) Congress did not intend that these facilities be regulatedunder section 405(f); (2) the dictionary meaning of ``domestic'' means``from a home or household'' and therefore does not include industrialfacilities; (3) it does not make sense to regulate sludges which are primarilyindustrial the same as sludges which are generated during municipal wastewater treatment; (4) there is no need to regulate these facilities undersection 405(f) because they are regulated under Subtitle D of RCRA andexisting State programs; (5) sanitary wastes typically are only a minusculepart of sludge at industrial facilities; and (6) such an approach wouldforce costly segregation of sanitary wastes at industrial facilities whichwas not intended by Congress or considered by EPA in terms of economicimpact. The commenter who said that EPA's position was contrary to Congressionalintent (despite reference in the legislative history to include coverageof privately owned treatment works even if they do not ``primarily'' treatdomestic sewage) argued that Congressional intent to vastly expand coverageof section 405 would have been more clearly indicated in the statute andlegislative history; instead Congress intended to include industrial treatmentworks that treated on-site generated sanitary wastes within the scope ofsection 405(f) only if those facilities also treat significant amountsof off-site generated household waste. EPA disagrees. Nothing in the statutory language suggests such a narrowlydefined scope. Further, Congress did clearly state its intent to significantlyexpand the scope of section 405(f). Congress not only made section 405applicable to any treatment works treating domestic sewage (as opposedto an earlier version that applied to treatment works treating primarilydomestic sewage), but it also specifically deleted an exclusion for industrialtreatment works. The Conference Report explains:<ITAG tagnum="21">The conference substitute modifies the Senate provisions by deletingan exclusion of privately owned treatment works operated in conjunctionwith industrial manufacturing and processing facilities. Such treatmentworks are covered * * * and their sludge is to be regulated by the samecriteria as sludge from [POTWs]. Similarly, the Conference substitute regulatesany treatment works treating domestic sewage, not just treatment workstreating ``primarily'' domestic sewage.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Conf. Rep. No. 99-1004 at 160. This strongly suggests that Congressintended section 405 to be read broadly with regard to industrial treatmentworks treating domestic sewage. The argument that industrial sludges should not be regulated under section405 because they are already controlled under RCRA Subtitle D and Stateprograms is not persuasive because POTW sludge is also a solid waste underRCRA and in many cases is regulated under State programs. If Congress intendedEPA to regulate these activities, the fact that they may also be regulatedunder RCRA and State law is not reason enough to eliminate them from coverageunder section 405.59.In response to the comment that it does not make sense to regulate sludgesthat are primarily industrial the same as sludges generated during municipalwastewater treatment, it must be pointed out that many POTWs treat vastquantities of industrial waste. Also, as noted above, EPA is gatheringadditional information to determine if sludge from POTWs and industrialfacilities are too dissimilar to be regulated under the same standards.EPA will be establishing requirements for industrial sludges in the future,when there is sufficient information about the pollutants of concern inindustrial sludges. It is possible that these standards may be co-promulgatedunder RCRA authority as well as under CWA section 405, and may apply topurely industrial sludges as well. If this is the case, no benefit wouldbe derived by segregating industrial and sanitary wastes at industrialfacilities. One commenter asked EPA to clarify whether sludges such as those from breweryand poultry processing operations whose characteristics resemble domesticsludge, and pumpings from septic tanks serving mortuaries are covered underthe definition. The sludges are covered by today's definition of sewagesludge if the treatment works generating the sludge also treats domesticsewage. However, assuming that the generating facilities are not POTWs,under proposed Part 503, these treatment works would be considered ``industrialtreatment works'' and therefore not covered by the first round of Part503 technical standards. Likewise, as with other industrial treatment workstreating domestic sewage, these facilities would not be required to obtaina permit under today's rule before applicable Part 503 regulations havebeen promulgated, unless the permitting authority determined, under section405(d)(4) or a comparable State authority, that a permit was needed earlierto protect public health and the environment. It is important to note the definition of ``domestic sewage'' in today'sfinal definition of treatment works treating domestic sewage is limitedto the sludge management program under section 405 of the CWA and is designedspecifically to carry out clear legislative intent with regard to thatprogram. It does not alter or affect the definition of ``domestic sewage''under other statutory provisions or regulations, such as section 1004(27),the domestic sewage exclusion under RCRA. <T3>Municipality. </T3>The proposed rule adopted the definition of ``municipality''from section 502(4) of the CWA. (The reference to section 502(4) has beendeleted in the final rule as unnecessary.) One commenter noted that publicschools, State parks, and the like were not considered municipalities underState law and asked whether they would be considered municipalities underthe proposed rule. Strictly speaking, public schools and State parks arenot considered ``municipalities.'' ``Municipalities'' refers to particularpolitical subdivisions of a State, not particular types of facilities.However, public schools and State parks could be owners or operators of``POTWs'' and thus would be subject to the new sludge permit program. <T3>Facility. </T3>The 1986 and 1988 proposals defined ``facility'' tomean ``all land and structures, other appurtenances, and improvements onthe land used for the treatment, storage, processing, utilization, or disposalof sewage sludge.'' One commenter to the 1986 proposal asked that EPA clarifywhether ``facility'' includes private lands on which sludge is applied.Seven commenters on the 1988 proposal objected to the definition becauseit could be read to include sites on which sludge is applied, and consequentlywould require that each land application site be the subject of a separatepermit action. This was not and is not EPA's intent. To ensure that thereis no confusion on this point, today's final rule does not include a separatedefinition of ``facility'' in Part 501. Similarly, the proposed revisionto the definition of ``facility'' in Part 122 is not in the final rule.This definition is unnecessary because other terms in today's final rule,such as ``treatment works treating domestic sewage'' adequately definethe entities subject to the permitting requirements established by theregulations. One commenter asked whether there was a difference between ``facility''in proposed andSection; 501.2 and ``sludge management facility'' in proposedrevisions to andSection; 124.10(d)(1) (vii). This question is now moot becausethe definition of ``facility'' has been dropped. New language appears intoday's final revisions to andSection; 124.10(d)(1)(vii). The phrase, ``sludgemanagement facility and disposal or use practice,'' which appeared in theproposed rule has been replaced by ``sludge treatment works treating domesticsewage and use or disposal sites.''<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Other changes to andSection; 124.10(d)(1)(vii) are explainedbelow in section V.G.2.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Similar editorial changes have been made in final revisions to thedefinition of ``facility or activity'' in andSection; 124.2. <T3>Sludge-only facilities. </T3>Section 405(f)(2) authorizes the Administratorto issue a permit ``solely to impose requirements for the use and disposalof sludge that implement [the Part 503 technical regulations]'' to ``atreatment works described in Paragraph (1) that is not subject to section402 of this Act and to which none of the other above listed permit programsnor approved State permit authority apply.'' Facilities needing a permitunder this section are called ``sludge-only facilities.'' Today's finalrule expands the NPDES permit program to cover these facilities for whichpermits are required under section 405(f)(2). A treatment works that appliesits effluent to land, rather than discharging it to surface waters is anexample of a treatment works that might fall into the category of ``sludge-only''facilities. Here, although the treatment works would not need an NPDESpermit for surface water discharges, it may generate sewage sludge subjectto regulation under section 405 and thus would require a sludge-only permitunder today's rule. EPA received very few comments on expanding the NPDES permit program toincorporate a program for regulating sludge use and disposal. One commenterspecifically endorsed EPA's use of the permit program under Part 122 asthe vehicle for issuing ``sludge-only'' permits authorized by section 405(f)(2).Another commenter, however, objected to using NPDES permits for ``sludge-only''facilities that do not have surface water discharges, and argued insteadthat these facilities should be issued permits under solid waste programs.EPA disagrees. There is no existing Federal solid waste permitting programwhich the Administrator could use for issuing permits to ``sludge onlyfacilities.'' Using an existing permitting program, such as NPDES, is moreefficient than establishing a new permit program. While the NPDES programtraditionally has focused on effluent discharges from wastewater treatmentplants, sludge generation and disposal is also an integral facet of wastewatertreatment and therefore represents a natural extension of the NPDES program,regardless of which sludge use or disposal option is used. Congress clearlythought so when it provided for the expansion of traditional NPDES jurisdictionto include regulation of sewage sludge use and disposal. Another commenter said that providing for ``sludge-only'' permits underNPDES when the treatment works is subject to permits under RCRA, SDWA orCAA would lead to confusion and possible unnecessary enforcement againstfacilities which are otherwise in compliance with their dominant permitrequirements. This situation should not arise under today's rule (and underthe CWA) because ``sludge-only'' permits will be issued only when the Part503 technical standards have not been included in a permit issued underRCRA Subtitle C, SDWA Part C (UIC program), CAA, MPRSA (ocean dumping permits),or an approved State sludge management program. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. </ITAG><T3>Users and Disposers of Sewage Sludge  </T3>The Water Quality Act of 1987 contains two provisions with respect to compliancewith the technical standards. First, the Act requires that, where POTWsand other treatment works treating domestic sewage are concerned, the standardsfor sludge use and disposal are to be implemented through permits. CWAsection 405(f)(1). In addition, the Act provides that ``* * * it shallbe unlawful for any person to dispose of sludge from a publicly owned treatmentworks or any other treatment works treating domestic sewage for any usefor which regulations have been established pursuant to subsection (d)of this section, except in accordance with such regulations.'' CWA section405(e). Thus the law requires that all persons disposing of sludge do soin accordance with applicable technical standards, even though the statutedoes not explicitly require such persons to obtain a permit implementingthose standards.zIn the March 9, 1988 proposed rule, EPA solicited comments on the bestmeans to regulate users and disposers; specifically, when would permitsbe appropriate. EPA also asked for comments on the appropriate scope ofthe generator treatment works' permit when the user or disposer of itssludge is covered by a permit. There were 31 commenters who responded to this issue: 16 State agencies,eight municipalities, three commercial sludge handlers, one environmentalgroup, one association, and one member of the general public. The commentersprimarily focused on what a State would have to do to have its sludge managementprogram approved, rather than the approach EPA should take where it isthe permit authority. Three State commenters felt that the requirements should be flexible: variousregulatory options should be available to the State, and the State woulddecide whether to issue permits to the treatment works (generator) or tothe disposer. One State commenter stated that EPA should require only thatthe State prohibit use and disposal of sewage sludge except in accordancewith CWA section 405(d). One commenter expressed the view that States begiven the authority to grant permits to other than sludge generators ona case-by-case basis. Six commenters felt that EPA should require thatthe treatment works' generator permit address sludge quality, and thenthe State would decide how to address requirements that apply at the disposalsite, whether in the treatment works' permit, in a site permit, throughrules of general applicability, general permits, or some other means, dependingon the disposal mechanism. These commenters felt that where the sludgegenerator was not using or disposing of its sludge, its responsibilityshould be limited to sludge quality. However, another commenter questionedwhether the generator's liability could be so limited, given other legalprecedents. Two State commenters thought that issuing joint permits toall persons involved_generator, hauler, site owner_with responsibilitiesof each spelled out in the permit, would be appropriate. Two commenters (one State and one environmental group) felt that all requirementsshould be in the treatment works' generator permit. These commenters feltthat this was the best means of ensuring that the sludge would be disposedof in accordance with the technical standards, thus making the generatorresponsible for the ultimate disposal of its sludge. These commenters recommendedthat a process similar to the pretreatment program be established, so thatthe treatment works would regulate users of its sludge as it now regulatesindustrial users that discharge effluent to its headworks. Several commenters expressed the view that to require permits for usersand disposers, such as farmers, would discourage their participation andthus inhibit beneficial reuse of sludge. One commenter stated that a permittingprogram for beneficial users of sludge and sludge products is too rigidto meet the response times of beneficial land needs, which are quite volatiledue to crop cycles, etc. Seven commenters addressed the specific question of how to regulate theusers of distributed and marketed sewage sludge. Two commenters expressedthe view that users should be informed of requirements through labels,and should be required to comply with labeling instructions. One commenterstated that because of the numerous small users of distributed and marketedsludge and sludge products, it would be more efficient to regulate theproducer of the product. Four other commenters also opposed requiring individualpermits for users of sludge or sludge products. Two commenters expressedconcern about the interstate commerce implications of distributed and marketedsludge products. One of these commenters recommended that national standardsbe developed for sludge products distributed in interstate commerce, andthat these standards preempt State and local law. Another commenter askedif generators would have to obtain permits in every State in which itsproduct is distributed and marketed. There are many circumstances where the sludge generator may not disposeof its own sewage sludge. One of the more common examples is where treatedsewage sludge is applied to land, by a farmer or by a private contractor,as a soil conditioner and fertilizer. It is clear that Congress intendedsection 405(e) to make the technical standards applicable to such usersand disposers:<ITAG tagnum="21">Section 405(e) is amended to expand the applicability of the 405(d)sludge use and disposal regulations to ``any person'' * * *. The purposeof this * * * change is to impose the regulations on those that actuallydispose of the sludge, which may not be the treatment works' owner or operator.''U. S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Report No. 99-50,May 14, 1985.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The question then becomes: what is the best means of ensuring thatthe sludge will be used or disposed of by these other parties in accordancewith the technical standards? This is one of the most complex problemsof the sludge program. One means of regulating these users and disposers is to rely on the directenforceability of the technical standards. This has been the primary meansof enforcing the current land application requirements contained in 40CFR Part 257. It is clear from the legislative history on Section 405 thatCongress intended that the technical sludge standards be self-implementing,i.e., all users and disposers are subject to them, whether or not theyhave a permit, and the standards may be enforced directly against usersand disposers in such instances: ``Notwithstanding the issuance of a permitthat implements a section 405(d) guideline, the guideline itself wouldremain directly enforceable under sections 309 and 405(e) of the Act.''(132 Cong. Rec. H10577, October 15, 1986.) (This is in contrast to theeffluent guidelines, which are not self-implementing. The discharge limitationsmust be in the discharger's permit in order for the discharger to be subjectto them. Enforcement actions are based on the permittee violating the conditionsof the permit.) Thus, since enforcement actions may be taken directly againstviolators, even in the absence of a permit, one means of ensuring complianceby users and disposers is simply to rely on this authority to take enforcementactions where necessary. However, total reliance on this general authority may not result in effectiveimplementation of the program in many instances. For example, some of thetechnical standards, as proposed, rely on site-specific factors, e.g.,the concentration of pollutants in a particular sludge would have to beknown before the sludge application rate can be calculated. Thus, simplyreferring to the technical standards would not be enough for the user toknow how much sludge can be applied to land. The treatment works wouldneed first to provide information on sludge quality, and then would needto factor in other site-specific considerations, such as whether sludgehad been applied to the same land in previous years. Further, in the absenceof a permit, it is often difficult for the regulatory agency to know whois using or disposing of sludge and whether they are doing so in accordancewith federal and State requirements. Thus, an effective sludge programshould utilize the permit mechanism to ensure adequate safety of the sludgeuse and disposal practices, without discouraging beneficial reuse and recycling.EPA has decided not to adopt an approach requiring the generator to regulateusers or disposers analogous to the pretreatment program. First, wherethe treatment works is, in effect, the recipient of a service (someoneelse is disposing of its sludge), it is not in the same position to regulateusers of its sludge, as it is in the pretreatment context, where it isthe provider of a service. The user of the sludge may simply refuse toaccept it, thus inhibiting reuse and restricting the POTW's disposal options.Further, there are likely to be more multi-jurisdictional problems thanthere are with pretreatment, due to the fact that sludge is readily transportableand is often used or disposed of in a different county or State from whereit is generated, and where the treatment works may not have any regulatoryauthority over the user. Usually the requirements of 40 CFR Part 503 will be contained in the generatortreatment works' permit. The Part 503 regulations and today's final rulesare designed so that the generator treatment works' permit can serve asthe primary implementation mechanism for ensuring compliance with the sludgetechnical standards. This approach also ensures the necessary link to thepretreatment program, so that the tools of that program (e.g., local limits)can be brought to bear on industrial users in order to improve the qualityof the treatment works' sludge. However, there may be instances where thegenerator's permit coverage may be limited to the specific activities conductedby the generator. The availability of such approaches will vary, dependingon the method of sludge use and disposal. Today's rule includes sludge monofills, sludge incinerators, and dedicatedland disposal sites (such as surface disposal sites) within the definitionof ``treatment works treating domestic sewage.'' This means that such facilities,even when privately owned or not connected to a POTW, are required to geta permit. Where the receiving facility is subject to a permit implementingthe Part 503 standards, the generator's permit need not address the requirementsin the recipient's permit regarding the operation of the recipient's facility.For example, if the sludge generator treatment works is sending its sludgeto an incinerator, the generator's permit could contain requirements asto sludge quality, and any other information pertaining to the agreementbetween the generator and the incinerator (e.g., information on the incinerator'semission limits where such limits may drive sludge quality requirements).The incinerator's permit could contain emission standards and other requirementspertaining to the operation of the incinerator, such as feed rate, combustiontemperature, etc. (Again, this incinerator permit may be an air permit,NPDES permit, one of the other permit programs listed under CWA section405(f)(1), or an approved State program permit. Whatever the mechanism,it must implement the applicable Part 503 sludge standards for incinerators.)Thus, all applicable requirements would be in either the sludge generator'sor the incinerator operator's permit. Another option would be to make thegenerator and the operator co-permittees. (Please note that, in today'srule, incinerator ash is not within the definition of sewage sludge. Therefore,users and disposers of incinerator ash are not subject to the sludge technicalstandards. However, since incinerator ash is a solid waste, such personsare subject to RCRA.) Another instance where a generator's permit may be limited is where thegenerator sends its sludge to a monofill (a landfill that accepts onlysludge), for reasons similar to those for incineration. Sludge sent toa sludge monofill will be regulated under Part 503. Part 503 will containcontaminant limits for sludge going to a monofill, and operation standardsfor the monofill. Where the treatment works generating the sludge operatesthe monofill, all of the monofill requirements would be in the treatmentworks' permit. Where the treatment works sends its sludge to a monofillthat it does not own or operate, requirements regarding sludge qualitycould be in the generator's permit, as well as other information such asthe nature of the agreement between the generator and the monofill. Requirementsregarding operation of the monofill could be in the monofill operator'spermit. (The monofill is a treatment works because it is used for sludgedisposal.) Thus, in this case, as with incineration, all requirements wouldbe implemented through a permit, either issued to the generating treatmentworks or the receiving treatment works. This is another instance whereit may be appropriate to make the two parties co-permittees. Sludge sent to a municipal solid waste landfill (a landfill that acceptsother types of solid wastes as well as sludge) is another disposal practicewhere the generator's permit conditions would apply to the quality of thesludge generated, rather than to the operation of the landfill facility.Municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) will be regulated under 40 CFRPart 258, rather than under 40 CFR Part 503. The 40 CFR Part 258 regulationswere proposed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 30, 1988 at 53 FR 33313 under the jointauthority of RCRA and section 405(d) of the Clean Water Act. Where thegenerator sends its sludge to a MSWLF that it does not own or operate,the permit issued to the sludge generating treatment works must at a minimumcontain provisions requiring the generator to comply with the 40 CFR Part258 criteria regarding the characteristics of sewage sludge that must bemet if the sludge is placed in an MSWLF. Under 40 CFR Part 258 as proposed,this would mean that the generator treatment works' permit would prohibitthe disposal in an MSWLF of sludge found to be hazardous (proposed andSection;258.28), and would require that the sludge pass the Paint Filter LiquidsTest (proposed andSection; 258.28). The operator of the MSWLF (receivingthe sewage sludge) would be responsible for complying with the landfilldesign, operation, and closure requirements in 40 CFR Part 258, which wouldbe implemented through the RCRA Subtitle D program. Thus, the requirementsas to sludge quality (in this case, that it is non-hazardous and not tooliquid) would be in the sludge generator's permit, and the requirementsas to landfill operation would be imposed on the landfill operator underRCRA Subtitle D. In addition to these requirements, the proposed Part 503regulations require that the generator treatment works send its sludgeto an MSWLF that has a State-issued Subtitle D permit. (<T3>See </T3>proposed andSection; 503.4(d)(2), 54 FR 5746, 5878, February6, 1989.) This means of reconciling the two programs for comprehensivebut not duplicative coverage is discussed in the preamble to the proposedPart 258 regulations, at 53 FR 33383 (August 30, 1988) and in the proposedPart 503 regulations at 54 FR 5746, 5794 (February 6, 1989). The most complex area for regulating non-permitted users and disposersof sludge arises with the land application of sewage sludge. Often, thetreatment works will give away or sell its sludge to farmers to be usedas a fertilizer or soil conditioner. It would be cumbersome and counter-productivefor EPA to require all farmers and other users of sewage sludge to obtainpermits, and might also have the very undesirable result of discouragingbeneficial use and recycling. The Part 503 regulations propose that sludgeapplied to agricultural or non-agricultural land must either be appliedby the treatment works itself, or the treatment works must have a contractor similar mechanism that spells out the Part 503 requirements with theperson who is applying the sludge. This is one means of putting the recipientof the sludge on additional notice as to Federal requirements regardinguse and disposal. The treatment works would be responsible for the properuse of its sludge by maintaining appropriate sludge quality, and specifyingappropriate application rates and other management practices through agreementswith the users (or with contractors who have agreements with the user).As stated earlier, the Part 503 regulations can be enforced directly againstany user or disposer regardless of whether the user or disposer has a permit.Records of these agreements kept by the treatment works would inform theregulatory agency of who is using the sludge and what the requirementsare.While EPA will not require that recipients of sewage sludge for beneficialreuse on land obtain a permit, because they are not considered ``treatmentworks treating domestic sewage,'' many States currently regulate sludgeby permitting the site where the sludge is used or disposed. As long asthe State program imposes the sludge quality and other applicable Part503 requirements on the treatment works through its permit, ensures compliancewith the technical standards, and meets the other requirements of Part123 or 501, a State program taking this approach can be approved. Another difficult situation for regulating other users and disposers iswhere the sludge is distributed and marketed. For example, a sludge compostor heat-dried sludge product may be sold to a nursery chain where it ispurchased in small quantities (in bags or bulk) by consumers and appliedto home lawns and gardens. While these end users are subject to the technicalsludge standards, as a practical matter it is not possible or desirableto regulate all of the end users through a permit. Further, EPA seeks toencourage such reuse practices where appropriate. The proposed Part 503regulations recognize that such end uses cannot be directly controlled,and therefore the contaminant limits for sludge products that are distributedand marketed must generally meet higher standards of quality. The Part503 regulations also propose that labels be affixed to the product or leafletscontaining information about the quality of the sludge and its appropriateuses accompany the product. The treatment works' permit would require thatthe treatment works' sludge meet limits regarding sludge composition andrelated conditions, and that the treatment works provide information tousers through leaflets or labels accompanying the product regarding appropriateuses of its sludge, or require, through a contact, that the distributorprovide the appropriate labels or leaflets. The user of the product wouldremain responsible for complying with the instructions provided in suchleaflets and labels. In addition to the agreement with the generator treatment works proposedin Part 503, the Agency may also regulate the distributor through a permit,particularly a distributor who accepts sludge from several treatment worksand prepares it to be sold, possibly mixing the sludge with other sludgesor other materials when producing products to be marketed. Where such ``distributor''alters the sludge quality, it is a ``treatment works treating domesticsewage'' and is required to obtain a permit. Permitting these distributorsis appropriate for three reasons: (1) To more effectively ensure that relevantinformation regarding sludge quality and appropriate uses is passed onto the end users; (2) to ensure that the quality of the end product, whichmay change from that of the sludge as a result of mixing with other materials,meets Part 503 requirements; and (3) the distributor may be located ina different State or county from the treatment works, where the State orcounty laws are more stringent than those where the treatment works islocated. Again, it may be appropriate to make the treatment works and thedistributor co-permittees. In response to comments that federal regulations for distributed and marketedsludge preempt local law, EPA does not feel that this approach would bein accordance with section 405, which expressly provides that the decisionof the appropriate use and disposal method is a local one (section 405(e))or with CWA section 510, which provides that States are free to set morestringent standards. One commenter also asked whether a sludge distributorwould be required to obtain a permit in every State where its product wassold. This is not a requirement under today's rules. However, the distributormust comply with whatever State law requires for distribution and/or saleof sludge or sludge products in that State. Today's rule gives the EPA Regional Administrator the authority to designatea user or disposer as a ``treatment works or other treatment works treatingdomestic sewage'' where he or she deems it is necessary to protect publichealth and the environment from potential adverse effects of sewage sludgepollutants or poor practices, or to ensure compliance with the technicalstandards. Thus, the permit mechanism can be employed to help guaranteethat sludge will be used or disposed of safely. Making the authority discretionaryenables the permit authority to take this approach where warranted, ratherthan imposing a permit requirement on all sludge handlers, which EPA believeswould be unworkable and undesirable. Where the Regional Administrator findsthat such designation as a ``treatment works treating domestic sewage''is necessary, he or she shall notify the user/disposer, who has 120 daysto submit a permit application. The reasons for designating a user or disposeras a treatment works should be stated in the permit's supporting documents,such as the fact sheet or statement of basis. This designation authorityapplies only when EPA is responsible for administering the sludge program.States have some flexibility in developing appropriate means of regulatingusers and disposers of sewage sludge.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>The Part 503 standards are independently enforceable evenif no permit is issued.</ITAG>In summary, under today's rule, in general the generator treatment works'permit is the primary vehicle for implementing the technical standards.However, the generator's permit may be limited in some circumstances. Allpermits issued by EPA (i.e., in unapproved States) to POTWs or other treatmentworks treating domestic sewage would, at a minimum, contain conditionsas to sludge quality, including monitoring, recordkeeping, and any otherrequirements necessary to ensure that concentrations of pollutants in sewagesludge and other requirements concerning sludge composition meet federalstandards, including information as to agreements with the recipients ofthe sludge. In the case of incineration and disposal in monofills, therequirements could be divided between the generator treatment works' andthe receiving treatment works' permit. In the case of sludge sent to aMSWLF, the generator treatment works is responsible for sludge qualityand for sending its sludge to a facility which is State-permitted underRCRA Subtitle D. The landfill operator is directly subject to RCRA SubtitleD. With land application, proper use by recipients of the sludge is assuredthrough contracts or similar mechanisms between the treatment works andcontractors, and between contractors and the user. Requirements for sludgethat is distributed and marketed are generally more stringent, becauseEPA, through permits, or the POTW, through contracts, cannot effectivelycontrol how the product is used. The generator treatment works is responsiblefor providing information as to appropriate uses; the user is responsiblefor complying with the instructions in the accompanying leaflets or labels.In special circumstances, someone who does not fit within the definitionof ``treatment works treating domestic sewage'' may be designated as atreatment works and required to obtain a permit for its sludge use or disposalactivities.With regard to State programs, today's rule requires that States: (1) Ata minimum, prohibit all use and disposal of sewage sludge that does notcomply with federal standards, and (2) issue permits to POTWs or othertreatment works treating domestic sewage which, at a minimum, require thepermittee to comply with applicable Part 503 requirements regarding sludgecomposition and requirements for contracts with other persons handlingthe sewage sludge in the case of application to land and distribution andmarketing. Today's rule gives flexibility to the States to devise appropriatemeans of regulating other users and disposers, such as site permits, generalpermits, rules of general applicability, etc. E. EPA's Authority Under Section 405(d)(4) of the CWA The revisions to Part 122 promulgated today codify the requirement in the1987 amendments directing the Administrator, prior to the promulgationof the technical sludge regulations to ``impose conditions in permits issuedto [POTWs] * * * or take other measures as the Administrator deems appropriateto protect public health and the environment from any adverse effects whichmay occur from toxic pollutants in sludge.'' This provision provides thebasis for EPA's interim sludge permitting strategy, discussed elsewherein this preamble.EPA reads section 405(d)(4) also to require EPA to protect public healthand the environment after promulgation of the Part 503 technical standardsincluding, where necessary, the development of permit conditions to controlsludge use or disposal on a case-by-case or ``best professional judgment''(BPJ) basis. This is in addition to the requirement to impose conditionsin NPDES permits that implement the requirements of Part 503 (the technicalstandards) and applies whenever a technical standard in Part 503 does notaddress a particular pollutant or practice which EPA determines is of concern.Similarly, section 405(d)(4) authorizes imposition of interim sludge requirementsin permits issued to non-POTWs (e.g., privately-owned treatment works treatingdomestic sewage, sludge incinerators unconnected to a facility treatingdomestic sewage) if necessary to protect public health and the environmentprior to the promulgation of applicable Part 503 requirements. In sum, in section 405(d)(4) Congress requires EPA to take action now toprotect the environment and to utilize whatever mechanism is necessary,including the issuance of permits, to effect this protection. In the preambleto the proposed rule, EPA solicited comments on whether, pursuant to Section405(d)(4), it should also write permit limits on a case-by-case, best professionaljudgment basis when an applicable Part 503 standard is outdated and thereforemay no longer be adequately protective. This would enable EPA to use newinformation to write limits that implement the statutory standard withoutwaiting until the completion of a new technical rulemaking, which can takeseveral years to develop and finalize. Numerous commenters, including States, POTWs, industries, and an environmentalgroup, commented on various aspects of EPA's authority under section 405(d)(4).The main topics addressed in the comments included: (1) Appropriatenessof writing BPJ sludge permit conditions in the absence of promulgated technicalstandards; (2) appropriate scope of BPJ conditions; (3) the status andeffect of interim, BPJ sludge limits when an applicable Part 503 standardis promulgated; and (4) using BPJ limits in lieu of an applicable, butoutdated, Part 503 standard. Two commenters expressed general support, based on the statutory language,for writing BPJ sludge permit conditions in the absence of applicable Part503 standards. Another commenter, however, said there was no need for suchbroad authority and that relying on the technical standards should be sufficient.Relying solely on the technical standards would ignore the language insection 405(d)(4) which provides for the development of permit conditionsor other appropriate measures to prevent possible adverse effects of toxicpollutants in sewage sludge ``prior to'' the promulgation of technicalstandards. The legislative history also refutes the position that relianceon technical standards is sufficient by indicating that EPA's BPJ authorityapplies after promulgation of the first round of technical standards. Conf.Rep. No. 99-1004, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. at 160 (1986). Today's final rulemerely codifies in andSection; 122.1(b)(3) and andSection; 122.44(b)(2) theauthority granted by section 405(d)(4) to develop ``interim'' conditionsand does not require individually developed sludge conditions in everyNPDES permit. When such limits might be needed is generally a case-by-casedetermination. EPA has, however, published guidance and policy which explainshow EPA is implementing section 405(d)(4). (See above discussion aboutEPA's Interim Implementation Strategy in section III.C.) One commenter opposed the use of BPJ limits unless there would be an ``opportunityfor standard correction that is not preempted by anti-backsliding provisions.''Under EPA's interim program and today's final rule, the basis for BPJ limitsmust be explained in the fact sheet that accompanies the draft permit.As with other permit terms, BPJ limits are subject to administrative andjudicial review. Finally, as explained below in section V.F.2, the ``anti-backsliding''provisions in the NPDES program do not apply to interim sludge limits.Therefore, the concerns of the commenters in this regard are inappropriate.Some commenters disagreed with EPA's interpretation of the proper scopeof BPJ limits. One commenter stated that EPA's authority under section405(d)(4) encompasses only ``best management practices'' (BMP) conditions,not limits on toxic pollutants in sludge. The commenter offered severalarguments to support this interpretation: Congress used the words ``conditions''in section 405(d)(4) rather than ``limits,'' a distinction maintained throughoutthe Act; Congress did not intend imposition of toxic limits prior to thecareful evaluation required to develop such limits through rulemaking (i.e.,such limits would be contrary to the regulatory scheme of the Act); andimposing toxic limits now could potentially upset the balance between environmentaland economic concerns by requiring capital expenditures that may not benecessary to meet subsequently promulgated technical standards. In contrast,another commenter said that EPA could develop BPJ limits only for thosepollutants identified pursuant to section 405(d)(2) for POTWs prior tothe adoption of final regulations under section 405(d)(2). EPA disagrees that Congress intended the authority under section 405(d)(4)to be so precisely limited as suggested by commenters. There is no significanceto the use of the words ``conditions'' rather than ``limits'' in describingEPA's authority with regard to the contents of permits. ``Conditions''is a generic term that refers to a broad range of requirements, includingnumeric limits on sludge quality and best management practices, imposedon permittees through the terms of a permit. The legislative history supportsthis broad interpretation. The conference report on the 1987 amendmentsexplains that ``the conference substitute directs the Agency to imposeconditions in individual 402 permits incorporating criteria and limitationson sludge or use or disposal or take other appropriate measures to protectpublic health and the environment. * * * until the Agency implements theregulations required by paragraph (2).'' Conf. Rep. No. 99-1004, 99th Cong.,2d Sess. at 160 (1986). One reason for this provision was ``* * * recognitionof the fact that some compliance deadlines for toxic contaminants in thesecond phase of regulation may extend to late 1989. * * *'' <T3>Id</T3>. at 159. While this supports Congressional intent to authorizepermit conditions addressing pollutants identified pursuant to section405(d)(2), it does not support the argument that only those pollutantsthat have been identified could be limited by ``interim'' conditions inpermits or other appropriate measures.EPA's interpretation of section 405(d)(4) is consistent with the regulatoryscheme as explained in the legislative history. Still, EPA is sensitiveto the problems that may arise if ``interim'' conditions significantlydiffer from those that will be required by the technical regulations. Thus,in developing its interim permitting strategy the Agency has sought toadopt approaches which are consistent with the anticipated direction ofthe technical standards. In addition, a primary emphasis of the interimstrategy will be ensuring compliance with existing federal requirements,such as 40 CFR Part 257. Generally, additional limits will be requiredonly for POTWs with known or suspected sludge use or disposal problems.The recommendations for additional limits are based on existing federalguidance and State requirements, and consist in most cases of best managementpractices, rather than numerical limits. EPA has adopted this approachin recognition that such measures are interim only. EPA's primary objectiveunder section 405(d)(4) remains the protection of public health and theenvironment. In a similar challenge to the scope of EPA's authority under section 405(d)(4),one commenter argued that the statutory deadlines in section 405(d)(2)mean that Congress intended the authority under section 405(d)(4) to expireby August 1988 (the statutory deadline for compliance with the first roundof technical standards) and that EPA's interpretation of section 405(d)(4)as a continuing grant of authority ``to further delay development of thisprogram'' is contrary to Congressional intent. This argument is without merit. Nothing in the statute or legislative historysuggests that EPA's authority under section 405(d)(4) expires by a datecertain. (In contrast, the statute clearly states that authority to approveremoval credits expires by August 1987, the deadline for promulgating thefirst round of technical standards.) Congress is undeniably impatient forpromulgation of comprehensive sludge technical standards because of thepotential environmental and public health impacts of disposing of contaminatedsewage sludge. Congress' impatience and the focus of its concern are reflectedin its decision to require interim measures in section 405(d)(4). To interpretEPA's authority under section 405(d)(4) to expire by a certain date regardlessof the status of the technical standards totally ignores the purpose ofinterim limits to protect public health and the environment. Indeed thispurpose, together with a statutory requirement to continually review, revise,and develop additional technical standards even after promulgation of thesecond round of regulations, argue for a continuing responsibility to imposeinterim conditions in the absence of technical regulations. EPA received mixed comments on whether BPJ limits would be appropriateas substitutes for applicable technical regulations when those regulationswere outdated and no longer were sufficient to protect public health andthe environment. States, a POTW, and an environmental group all supportedthe general concept of using BPJ in lieu of an applicable, but outdated,Part 503 standard. Most commenters, however, expressed reservations orconditions, sometimes contradictory, as to the appropriate authority fortaking such action. For example, two commenters said States should havethe authority to supplant Part 503 standards to take into account localconditions or needs, while two other commenters (also States) said EPAmust carefully control BPJ authority in this situation to avoid confusion,inconsistent application, and immediate State imposition of alternate BPJlimits upon promulgation of Part 503. Several supported this option onlyif the alternate standards would be subject to scientific review in additionto public review. One commenter said alternate limits that were less stringentthan existing Part 503 regulations should also be available. On the otherhand, three commenters, all regulated parties, opposed the use of BPJ limitsin lieu of Part 503 standards as contrary to the scheme under the CWA forpromulgating and regularly updating the technical standards. Technical standards may become outdated. However, as noted by even thesupporters of a broad BPJ authority, determining when a standard has becomeoutdated and therefore not sufficiently protective of public health andthe environment for any particular pollutant would be difficult. Moreover,the statute contemplates regular updating of the technical standards, throughpromulgation of new regulations, and requires EPA to see that accurate,up-to-date standards are in place. This scheme, and the integrity of existingtechnical standards, could be undermined by the use of BPJ limits to supplantregulations promulgated according to the Act's requirements. In any event,the potential need for interim limits in lieu of ``outdated'' regulationsis many years away. For these reasons, today's rule does not provide forthe development of BPJ standards in lieu of an existing Part 503 standard.(Note, however, that EPA can develop BPJ limits for pollutants, managementpractices, etc., which are not regulated by the Part 503 standards applicableto the use or disposal method used by the permittee.)F. Permitting Requirements (Part 122) <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General  </ITAG>Part 122 establishes the essential requirements for NPDES permits issuedpursuant to section 402 of the Act by EPA or an approved State. It establishesthe scope of the NPDES permit program, general requirements governing theadministration of the program, application requirements, required permitconditions, and permissible causes for modifying or terminating NPDES permits.Before today's final rule, these regulations specifically addressed sludgerequirements for NPDES permittees in a very limited way. The NPDES regulationsprovided that sludge may not be discharged to waters of the United Statesand more generally required that NPDES permits contain any conditions requiredby section 405 of the Act regarding the disposal of sewage sludge fromPOTWs (andSection; 122.44(o)). Part 124 contains the procedural requirementsfor issuing NPDES permits and similarly lacked specific provisions forsludge. The WQA of 1987 requires that the Part 503 technical sludge regulationsbe implemented through permits and designates NPDES permits as the primaryimplementation mechanism, unless the Part 503 requirements are implementedthrough permits issued under other Federal programs (Subtitle C of RCRA,Part C of the Safe Drinking Water Act, MPRSA, or the Clean Air Act) orState programs approved pursuant to section 405(f). See section 405(f)(1).Accordingly, today's final rule amends Part 122 to establish requirementsfor including in NPDES permits any terms and conditions necessary to implementthe sludge standards in Part 503 as well as any others which may be necessaryto protect human health and the environment pursuant to section 405(d)(4).In addition, EPA is amending Parts 122 and 124 to make the permitting programestablished under those parts the vehicle for EPA issuance of ``sludge-only''permits under section 405(f)(2) of the CWA. That section authorizes EPAto issue permits which implement the sludge technical standards to anytreatment works that treats domestic sewage where the treatment works isnot otherwise subject to NPDES and is not subject to sludge requirementsthat implement section 405 contained in other Federal permits or permitsissued under an approved State program. A treatment works that appliesits effluent to land or uses an evaporation pond rather than dischargingit to surface waters is an example of a treatment works that might be a``sludge-only'' facility. Here, although the treatment works would notneed an NPDES permit for surface water discharges, it may be a ``treatmentworks treating domestic sewage'' under section 405(f) and thus would requirea permit under the final rule. The revisions to Parts 122 and 124 promulgated today apply to all NPDESpermits for treatment works treating domestic sewage which are issued byEPA and by States which choose to administer an approved sludge managementprogram as part of their NPDES programs. These revised permitting requirementsand procedures are also the basis for the permit requirements that mustbe followed by States which choose to administer an approved sludge programindependently from an NPDES program, i.e., under Part 501. Part 501 separatelylists the permit requirements and procedures applicable to non-NPDES Stateprograms. The discussion of comments and changes from the proposed rulerelating to those requirements, however, are included in the discussionbelow on specific revisions to Parts 122 and 124. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Specific Revisions </ITAG><T3>Purpose and Scope. </T3>Several revisions to andSection; 122.1 reflectthe expanded scope of the NPDES program to include requirements for sludgeuse and disposal pursuant to section 405 of the CWA. These include: updatingthe citation for the Clean Water Act in andSection; 122.1(a)(1) to includePub. L. 100-4, the Water Quality Act of 1987; adding a new paragraph (a)(3)which states that the permit program established under Part 122 appliesto the use and disposal of sewage sludge by owners or operators of anytreatment works treating domestic sewage (whether or not they would otherwisebe required to obtain an NPDES discharge permit) unless all requirementsimplementing section 405(d) regulations have been included in a permitissued under one of the Federal permit programs listed in section 405(f)(1)or an approved State program; in paragraph (d)(2), adding the Part 503technical sludge regulations to the list of separate regulations whichthe NPDES permit program is designed to implement; including in paragraph(g) the provisions from the amended section 405 that address the inclusionof sludge conditions in NPDES and ``sludge-only'' permits and the authorityfor approved State programs under section 405(f).<T3>Sludge-only facilities. </T3>Today's final rule expands the scope ofPart 122 to cover ``sludge-only'' permits (andSection; 122.1) and to indicatewhere the requirements for ``sludge-only'' permits differ from the requirementsapplicable to other NPDES permittees (e.g., andSection; 122.21(c)(2)), specifyingwhen a ``sludge-only'' facility would have to apply; andSection; 122.21(d)(3)(ii),specifying the information a ``sludge-only'' facility must submit withits application; andSection; 122.44(j)(2), requirement for pretreatment programswhen necessary to assure compliance with Section 405 requirements). Noone commented on the proposed revisions to specify requirements applicableonly to ``sludge-only'' facilities; accordingly, they will be promulgatedas proposed. The general requirements applicable to NPDES permittees wouldalso apply to ``sludge-only'' permittees except where the requirements,by their own terms, apply only to discharges to surface waters. Commentson expanding the NPDES permit program to incorporate a program for regulatingsludge use and disposal are discussed in Section V.C. above. By definition, ``sludge-only facilities'' are unique to an EPA-administeredsludge program, i.e, they are facilities not covered by an approved Statesludge management program. There is some confusion on this point. One Stateread the proposed rule to mean that it would have to establish an NPDESprogram for purposes of regulating facilities that apply their effluentto land rather than regulating these facilities through an existing non-NPDESprogram. That is not the case. Although the State sludge program will applyto all ``treatment works treating domestic sewage''_those that currentlyare subject to NPDES permits as well as those that are not (e.g., non-dischargingfacilities)_the State may continue to regulate the non-dischargers throughan existing non-NPDES program as long as it meets the requirements of Part501. ``Sludge-only facilities'' will have the same requirements as other``treatment works treating domestic sewage''; the only difference is thatwith the ``sludge-only facilities'' the sludge requirements are not beingimplemented through an existing permit issued under another program. Therefore,a State may continue to regulate, through a program approved under Part501, those facilities which would be considered ``sludge-only facilities''if EPA were the permit-issuance authority. In fact, to be approved underPart 501, the State must regulate all POTWs and other treatment works treatingdomestic sewage, regardless of whether these facilities have surface waterdischarges. In response to comments, today's final rule includes several editorialchanges to the definition of ``sludge-only facility.'' First, the finaldefinition refers to the defined term ``treatment works treating domesticsewage'' to clarify that only those facilities which fall within that definitioncan be ``sludge-only facilities.'' Second, the final definition deletesreference to the term ``sludge use or disposal practices.'' Commenterserroneously interpreted this reference to mean that, for example, accesspoints to the collection system, septic tanks, farmers, and homeownerswould be included within the definition of ``sludge-only facility'' andthus would be required to obtain a permit. This is not EPA's intent andtherefore the phrase has been eliminated. Instead, the definition now refersto ``sludge use or disposal method(s) * * * subject to regulations promulgatedpursuant to section 405(d) of the CWA.'' This means only those treatmentworks whose use or disposal methods are regulated by Part 503 are includedin the definition of ``sludge-only facility.'' <T3>Permit as a shield. </T3>Consistent with the language in section 402(k)of the Act and the 1987 amendments to section 405, EPA proposed to amendandSection; 122.5, the ``permit as a shield'' provision, to exclude section405(d) from the scope of that provision. Thus, under the proposed revisionto andSection; 122.5, compliance with a permit would not necessarily constitutecompliance with section 405(d). The proposed rule retained ``permit asa shield'' coverage for section 405 (a)-(b) because those sections concernEPA's authority to require NPDES permits and establish effluent limitationsfor disposal of sewage sludge to surface waters to the same extent as forother pollutant discharges regulated through NPDES permits, and thus wereunaffected by the 1987 amendments to Section 405. At the same time, EPA explained that it did not read the CWA to prohibitlimited protection for permittees who comply with their permit in certainsituations. Accordingly, it solicited comments on two alternative waysto provide some protection to permittees from enforcement actions whenthey are in compliance with permit conditions designed to implement a Part503 (i.e. section 405(d)) standard. One suggested approach was to adopta limited affirmative defense which a permittee could assert in an enforcementaction if it were in compliance with a permit condition developed to implementthe Part 503 standard allegedly violated. The defense would not be availableif the permit did not address the requirement allegedly violated or forcompliance with interim limits developed on a case-by-case basis pursuantto section 405(d)(4) if the pollutant or other parameter in question weresubject to a subsequently-promulgated requirement in Part 503 that addressedthat pollutant or parameter. Under the second proposed approach, EPA wouldpromulgate a regulation that deemed permit conditions which implement particularPart 503 standards to be Part 503 standards. Under this option, compliancewith those permit conditions would be compliance with Part 503 and hence,compliance with section 405(d) requirements. The reasoning behind bothapproaches was that: (1) It would be unfair to subject a permittee to anenforcement action for a violation of section 405 when the permittee wasin compliance with permit terms specifically designed to implement thePart 503 standard allegedly violated; and (2) providing protection to thepermittee in this case reinforces the integrity of the permitting systemand acknowledges the permittee's good faith efforts to comply with thesection 405(d) regulations by complying with its permit. Several commenters took issue with EPA's interpretation of the section402(k) and its applicability to section 405(d) standards. The one commenterwho objected to EPA's ``limited affirmative defense approach'' assertedthat providing such protection would be a blatant circumvention of Congressionalintent. Instead, the commenter argued, EPA should rely on its enforcementdiscretion in appropriate situations. At the other extreme, several commentersasserted that section 402(k) of the CWA does include section 405(d), i.e.,the proposed revision to andSection; 122.5, which would delete permit asa shield protection for section 405(d), was unnecessary and unauthorized.In support of this position, these commenters argued that: failure to revisesection 402(k) was an oversight or was unnecessary because section 405already falls within the scope of section 402(k) via andSection; 122.5; section405(a)-(c) make section 402 procedures and requirements applicable withequal force to permits issued under section 405; if Congress had intendedto exclude section 405(d) from section 402(k) protection it would havedone so explicitly (as in the case of section 307(a)); the Agency's interpretationis contrary to Congressional intent that section 402(k) was designed toassure that mere promulgation of limitations will not subject a permitteeto prosecution until limitations are made conditions of a permit; and theAdministrator has ample authority to reopen permits if necessary to protectpublic health and the environment. EPA disagrees that the CWA proscribes one position or the other. Congresscreated an ambiguous situation by not revising section 402(k) to give thesame ``permit-as-a-shield'' protection for compliance with permits whichimplement section 405(d) standards as it did for other standards underthe CWA, but at the same time requiring that section 405(d) be implementedthrough permits, including section 402 permits. The statute also requires,without exception, compliance with regulations promulgated pursuant tosection 405(d) within one year after promulgation of the regulations, whetheror not the standards have been included in a permit, and Congress clearlyintended that the regulations be directly enforceable. Conf. Rep. No. 99-1004,99th Cong. 2d Sess., printed in 132 Cong. Rec. H10577 (October 15, l986).The fact that section 402(k) does not specifically exclude section 405(d)from its scope as it excludes section 307(a) adds to this ambiguity. EPAtherefore must use its judgment in determining which course can best furtherCongressional goals. In this case, EPA has determined that those goalscan best be served by promulgating a regulation that protects a permitteewho complies with a Part 503 standard in the limited circumstances describedabove under the first proposed alternative. Further, EPA believes thatsuch protection is warranted in the case of citizen suits brought underSection 505 of the CWA as well as for EPA enforcement actions. Therefore,it is necessary to establish this protection for permittees in the regulations,rather than by exercising enforcement discretion. Today's rule is consistentwith the CWA because it does not protect against liability for a failureto comply with the statutory deadline (i.e., compliance with interim permitlimits would not insulate a permittee from liability for failing to complywith Part 503 standards by the statutory deadline). Despite disagreements about the rationale for and appropriate scope ofprotection, commenters overwhelmingly supported the general concept ofproviding protection against enforcement to a permittee who complies withits permit for the reasons stated in the preamble to the proposed rule.Both alternatives discussed above received approximately the same amountof support, although commenters generally did not explain why they preferredone over the other. One commenter suggested that the need to provide suchprotection could be avoided by making the Part 503 standards advisory guidancerather than binding regulation. This alternative is not available underthe CWA because the statute clearly requires that the Part 503 standardsbe in the form of regulations and that those regulations be directly enforceable.In today's final rule, EPA is promulgating the first alternative, whichestablishes an affirmative defense to an enforcement action for violatingthe Part 503 regulations (i.e., section 405(d)) based on compliance withpermit conditions designed to implement a particular Part 503 standard.EPA chose this approach rather than the second alternative, because theaffirmative defense approach is more tailored to the narrow purpose ofprotecting permittees who are in good faith compliance with their permitsagainst enforcement actions. The second proposed approach could have beenread more broadly to establish an alternative standard-setting mechanism.Permittees may assert the affirmative defense only in limited circumstances.It would apply when the permittee can demonstrate compliance with a permitcondition that was developed to implement a particular Part 503 standard.One commenter said that the defense should cover both permitted and unpermittedconditions (covered by Part 503) to avoid confusion and frustration forthe permittee and Agency. EPA agrees as long as the ``unpermitted condition''is addressed in the applicable Part 503 standard and the permittee candemonstrate that it was not limited in the permit because it was determinednot to be of concern (e.g., through documentation in the fact sheet). Thedefense would not apply, however, where a Part 503 standard is not includedin the permit because the permittee failed to submit all relevant informationrequested during the application process or pursuant to its duty to updateor supply missing information. Compliance with permit conditions implementingPart 503 standards is not a blanket shield, however. Compliance with permitconditions implementing Part 503 standards that apply to one disposal optionwould not be a defense to an action based on violating standards applicableto another disposal option. Likewise, it would not protect the permitteefrom liability for complying with subsequently promulgated or revised Part503 standards applicable to the permittee's sludge use or disposal practices.Providing a defense in this situation would be contrary to the statutorydeadlines in section 405(d)(2) for complying with the technical standards.Under today's rule, compliance with interim limits developed on a case-by-casebasis pursuant to section 405(d)(4) of the Act would not shield the permitteefrom an enforcement action for violating a subsequently promulgated Part503 standard that was more stringent or broader than the interim limit.A few commenters specifically suggested that any defense should apply inthis situation. Other commenters similarly argued that interim limits shouldprotect a permittee from permit modifications to implement a Part 503 standardpromulgated after permit issuance. For example, one State said that suchprotection is necessary because State law prohibits permit modificationfor ten years. Here again, providing a defense based on compliance withinterim limits would be contrary to the statutory deadlines for complyingwith the technical standards in section 405(d)(2). (Note also that a ten-yearpermit is contrary to today's final rule. <T3>See </T3>andSection; 122.46 and andSection; 501.15(a)(5).) It is also importantto note that today's final rule creates an affirmative defense to enforcementactions. It does not create a bar to permit modification for cause. Today'sfinal rule has been revised to specifically provide for reopening and modifyingpermits to incorporate Part 503 standards which are promulgated after permitissuance. One commenter argued that compliance with the permit should be a completedefense for each pollutant limited in the permit for all pathways of exposureincluding those regulated under other laws; otherwise excessive and unnecessaryburdens would be imposed on small entities and their ability to compete,especially if liability reaches small entities like landscapers and gardenshops. Limiting liability in this way is not possible since the CWA doesnot give EPA the authority to preclude liability under, or preempt, otherlaws (Federal, State, or local). (<T3>See </T3>sections 405(d)(5) and 510 of the CWA.) Any additional liabilityimposed on small entities has been imposed by the other statutes referredto by the commenter, not by these regulations. In fact, today's final rulecreates a defense to liability (to the extent authorized by the CWA) whenthere has been good faith compliance by a permittee. Therefore, EPA disagreesthat today's rule places an unnecessary, excessive, or unfair burden onsmall entities. The affirmative defense created today applies only to a permittee's liabilityunder the CWA (i.e., enforcement actions brought under Federal law). Asnoted above, EPA cannot in these regulations provide defenses to liabilityimposed under other laws, particularly State and local laws. Therefore,States with approved programs that wish to provide a similar defense underState law to permittees would have to do so separately. EPA would examineany defense under State law to ensure that it is not at odds with the limiteddefense available under Federal law. <T3>Application procedures</T3>. Section 122.21 establishes applicationrequirements for NPDES permittees. EPA proposed revisions to this sectionboth for ``traditional'' NPDES permittees and ``sludge-only'' permittees.Today, the Agency is finalizing those revisions with the changes explainedbelow. The first revision to andSection; 122.21(a), addresses who must apply fora permit. EPA proposed to revise this paragraph to state that, in additionto ``any person who discharges or proposes to discharge pollutants,'' anyperson who owns or operates a ``sludge-only facility'' also has a dutyto apply for a permit. EPA received no comments on this proposed revision.Therefore, the final rule is the same as the proposed rule. The proposal also specified <T3>when</T3> sludge-only facilities would be required to apply: existingfacilities within 120 days after promulgation of 40 CFR Part 503 (or earlierif necessary to protect public health and the environment); new facilitiesthat commence operation after promulgation of 40 CFR Part 503, at least180 days prior to the date proposed for commencing operation. This proposedrevision has been changed to clarify more precisely when sludge-only facilitiesmust apply, and, in response to comments, to address when other treatmentworks treating domestic sewage (i.e., those already covered under the NPDESprogram) must apply. Under today's final rule, States seeking program approvalunder Part 501 must also be able to implement requirements concerning whenvarious parties must apply equivalent to those in today's final revisionsto andSection; 122.21. (<T3>See</T3> andSection; 501.15(d)(1).) Today's final revisions addressing when the application requirements mustbe submitted appear in a new paragraph andSection; 122.21(c)(2). Under andSection;122.21(c)(2)(i), POTWs with currently effective NPDES permits must submitthe required sludge information (explained below) with their next applicationor within 120 days after promulgation of an applicable Part 503 standard,whichever occurs first. POTWs are addressed separately because the 1987amendments to the CWA provide for the immediate regulation of POTWs withNPDES permits. Under EPA's interim sludge permitting strategy, sludge permitconditions are to be considered for each POTW as its permit is reissued.Therefore, POTWs are required by today's final rule to submit informationabout sludge use and disposal with their next applications. Today's finalrule also provides for a POTW to submit a new application if, during thepermit term, a Part 503 standard applicable to the POTW is promulgated.Sections 122.21(c)(2) (ii) and (iii) apply to non-NPDES POTWs, as wellas all other treatment works treating domestic sewage, i.e., those facilitiesnot specifically targeted for immediate regulation under section 405(d)(4)of the CWA. These include privately-owned treatment works treating domesticsewage and sludge-only facilities. As in the proposal, application informationmust be submitted by an existing facility within 120 days after promulgationof an applicable standard or earlier if the Director determines that apermit is needed to protect public health and the environment. Facilitiesthat commence operation after promulgation of an applicable standard mustsubmit the application information at least 180 days before the date proposedfor commencing operation. Today's final rule is different from the March1988 proposed rule in two respects. First, it has been rephrased to applyto privately-owned treatment works treating domestic sewage as well asto sludge-only facilities. Second, under the proposed rule, the duty toapply was triggered by promulgation of ``40 CFR Part 503.'' This couldbe interpreted to require submission of application information upon thepromulgation of the first round of the 503 standards even if those standardsdid not apply to the applicant's sludge use or disposal. Today's finalrule clarifies that the duty to apply for a permit is triggered by promulgationof Part 503 standard that is applicable to the facility's sludge use ordisposal methods. Therefore, facilities not covered by the first roundof Part 503 standards (e.g., industrial manufacturing and processing orcommercial facilities that treat domestic sewage along with process wastewater)generally will not be required to submit sludge application informationuntil promulgation of Part 503 standards applicable to them. In all cases,however, the permitting authority could require any facility to submitinformation earlier when necessary to take interim measures to protectpublic health and the environment pursuant to section 405(d)(4) of theCWA or equivalent State authority. Applicants are required to send their applications to ``the Director.''Under the NPDES regulation, ``Director'' means the Regional Administratorwhen EPA is the permit-issuing authority and the State Program Directorin the case of an approved State NPDES program. One commenter asked thatEPA revise the regulation to allow applications to be sent to ``authorizedadministrators under the Director.'' Nothing in today's rule precludesStates from requiring applicants to submit applications to authorized representativesof the Director. Therefore, a revision is not necessary. (Today's ruledoes, however, limit who may be authorized to make final decisions on permitactions. See the discussions on assignment of program responsibilitiesin section V.I.1 and on the conflict-of-interest standard for State permittingboards in section V.I.6 of this preamble.) Today's rule does not require applicants to submit the required informationabout their sludge use and disposal practices on a particular form. Onecommenter said that EPA should require uniform national application formsto enable EPA and the States systematically to evaluate and use data frompermit applicants. EPA agrees that these objectives are worth pursuing.EPA is in the process of updating the permit application forms for municipaldischargers, and expects to incorporate the sludge information requiredby today's final rule. The part of the form requesting sludge informationshould also be useful for obtaining information from non-municipal dischargers.<T3>Application requirements. </T3>The March 1988 proposed rule also specifiedthe application requirements for both sludge-only permittees and NPDESpermittees that are POTWs or other treatment works treating domestic sewagein a proposed revision to andSection; 122.21(d)(3). This revision providedthat these permit applicants submit the information required under 40 CFR501.15(a)(2). General information requirements included name, address,and location, and an identification of the activities which bring the facilityunder the jurisdiction of section 405. The applicant must also identifywhether it is subject to any of the listed environmental permit programs.This is important in order to provide notice of the sludge permit to otheraffected programs and to determine whether some Part 503 requirements arealready included in other permits. More specific information requirements under the proposal included a topographicmap of the treatment works property depicting the location of any sludgemanagement facilities, including on-site disposal sites. Applicants alsowould have to describe their sludge use and disposal practices since useor disposal options will be the basis on which limits are established underPart 503. Under the proposed rule, the description of sludge use and disposal practiceswould include a specific identification of the sites where the applicantproposes to transfer sludge for treatment and/or disposal, as well as thenames of applicators, distributors, or other contractors that will handlethe disposal of the applicant's sludge. In the case of sludge or sludgeproducts (e.g., compost) which are distributed and marketed to the generalpublic, the permit applicant would identify the distributor, if differentfrom the applicant. This information will be important for purposes oftracking the sludge to ensure that it is properly managed as provided forin applicable Federal standards. (Whether persons other than the applicant(e.g., a contractor) must obtain a permit is discussed in section V.D.3above.) Applicants must also state their annual sludge production volume.The proposed rule also contained general requirements to submit availabledata on sludge quality and groundwater monitoring, to provide the permitwriter with any additional information needed to ascertain compliance withthe Part 503 standards, and to submit any other information the Directormay reasonably require to assess the sludge use and disposal practices,for example, where permit conditions are developed on a case-by-case basis.In such circumstances, the permit writer may decide that groundwater factorsat the disposal site, such as distance to water supply wells, water tablefluctuations, and proximity to wetlands, should be considered in developingpermit conditions. The final rule includes two major changes to the proposed application requirements,which were adopted in response to comments. The first involves the useof approved land application plans for establishing requirements applicableto individual land application sites identified after permit issuance (inlieu of the usual procedures for submitting application information anddeveloping or modifying permit conditions). The second concerns the requirementsto submit a topographic map. Each of these changes are explained in moredetail below. In other respects, the final rule is substantially the sameas the proposed rule. Under the proposed rule, applicants would be required to identify on theirpermit application the location of all off-site sludge disposal sites.New sites identified after permit issuance would have to be first broughtto the attention of the Director and the permit modified to approve specificapplication sites, following the usual procedures for permit modification.A number of commenters, all State agencies, opposed requiring individualpermit actions for land application site approvals because of the needfor public notice and associated permit issuance procedures. Commentersasserted that the decision whether to provide notice for every site shouldbe left to States or to local jurisdictions. Commenters also asserted thatpermitting procedures would be too burdensome if required for every site.One commenter noted that such procedures were not compatible with the needto issue land application approvals in coordination with crop growth cyclesand suitable periods for sludge application. Two commenters asserted thatrequiring public notice for each site would discourage beneficial reusebecause of public misunderstanding about risks. Two of the commenters proposedan alternative approach which is used by several States: rather than requiringindividual permit actions for each approval of a land application siteafter permit issuance, the Agency should require POTWs (or other sludgegenerators) to submit a land application plan which would be subject topublic notice and comment when the permit is issued.After reviewing the comments on this issue, EPA has decided to modify itsproposal so as not to unduly discourage beneficial reuse of sewage sludge.Today's rule adopts a variation of the commenters' alternate approach ofrequiring submission of a land application management plan. Under today'srule, an applicant that intends to apply its sludge to land must either:(l) Identify each land application site that will be used during the lifeof the permit on the permit application; or (2) submit a land applicationplan. Land application plans are not required for the land applicationof sludge that meets requirements for distribution and marketing of sewagesludge. The application plan must, at a minimum, describe the territory coveredby the plan, detail how the applicant or its agent will select and manageindividual application sites, provide for advance notice of new land applicationsites and a reasonable opportunity to object to the permitting authority,and provide for public notice of new sites as required by State or locallaw, but in all cases, must require at least notice to adjacent or abuttingland owners and occupants. Additional details of the plan would be developed on a case-by-case basis,using guidance and any applicable Part 503 standards. For example, siteselection criteria should address such conditions as slope of appropriatesites, any runon/runoff control measures, ground-water monitoring, andaccess control that may be needed at high use-rate sites, buffer stripsaround surface waters, drinking water wells and dwellings, minimum depthto usable ground water, and how an evaluation of site soil texture andparent geologic material will be factored into site selection. (These twofactors influence permeability, infiltration, and drainage. Highly permeablesoils such as sand and highly impermeable soil such as clay may presentspecial design and operational problems.) Site management guidelines whichshould be addressed include sludge application rates, control of loadingsof heavy metals (these pollutants tend to accumulate at application sites),seasonal limitations, and how compliance with important site selectionfactors (e.g., adequate buffer strips, slope limitations) will be maintainedas the site is used.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>EPA's Process Design Manual for Land Application of MunicipalSludge is an excellent resource for permit writers to consult when reviewingland application plans.)</ITAG>The applicant must submit its land application plan with its permit application.The land application plan would be subject to public notice and commentas part of the permit. Thereafter, approval of individual land applicationsites by the permitting agency is required, but the permitting proceduresthat normally would apply to permit modification (i.e., preparation ofa draft permit, public notice, etc.) would not be required. Instead, approvalof a new land application site (pursuant to an approved land applicationplan) would follow the procedures established in the plan. Minimally, theplan would require advance notice to the permitting authority and a reasonableopportunity to object, and notice to neighbors if not already requiredby State or local law. These are minimum requirements. The permit writercould determine that more extensive notice requirements are appropriate.Today's rule also revises andSection; 122.62 to provide for land applicationplans to be approved separately or revised as a permit modification. EPA chose to provide for land application plans as an alternative to requiringidentification of, and permit conditions for, all potential land applicationsites at the time of permit issuance because of the large number of landapplication sites that POTWs and other sludge generators use, and the impracticabilityof requiring full-scale permitting procedures before using any site thatwas not specifically identified at permit issuance. EPA considered, andrejected, requiring applicants to only apply sludge to sites identifiedin the permit application. As noted by commenters, this would severelyrestrict the flexibility of the applicant in managing reuse of its sludge,particularly for use on agricultural lands, and therefore discourage beneficialuse, contrary to Agency policy and Congressional intent. At the same time, EPA does not agree that public notice of sludge use anddisposal is incompatible with beneficial reuse. In fact, public noticeand education are necessary for building and maintaining public acceptancewhich will be critical for establishing viable beneficial reuse programs.Today's final rule provides for public notice without sacrificing the expeditedprocedures critical to programs for beneficial reuse of sludge on agriculturallands. Public notice is provided initially when the land application planis developed as part of the permit. The public will have an opportunityto comment on the guidelines the POTW or its agent will follow in selectingand managing land application sites and on the notice procedures that thepermittee must follow when it proposes to apply sludge to a site not identifiedin the plan. The requirement that permitting authorities approve individualsites gives the authority an opportunity to determine if the site is appropriatefor sludge reuse under the criteria approved in the land application plan.State or local jurisdictions may choose at their discretion how much publicnotice should be required for each site identified after plan approval,but in all cases the permittee will be required to notify site neighbors.To ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to comment on theland application plan, today's final rule requires that the public noticeof the permit reaches areas within the territorial scope of the land applicationplan. (See andSection; 501.15(d)(5)(ii)(B) and andSection; 124.10(c)(2)(i).)The public notice must indicate that the permit includes a land applicationplan (andSection; 501.15(d)(5)(iii)(a)(<T3>3</T3>) and andSection; 124.10(d)(1)(vii)). In addition, a fact sheetmust be prepared (andSection; 501.l5(d)(4) and andSection; 124.8(a) and thefact sheet for the draft permit must briefly describe the contents of theland application plan (andSection; 501.15(d)(4)(i)(C) and andSection; 124.56(e)).The fact sheet should clearly explain that the land application plan willestablish the public notice procedures that must be followed before applyingsludge to future sites not known at the time of permit issuance. The othersignificant change to application requirements contained in today's finalrule concerns the requirement to submit a topographic map. The March 1988proposed rule would have required that all permit applicants submit a topographicmap (or other map if a topographic map is unavailable) extending one milebeyond the property boundaries of the source, depicting the location ofthe sludge management facilities (including disposal sites). Three State agencies, three POTWs or municipalities, and one POTW tradeassociation provided comments on the topographic map requirement. Threecommenters recommended deleting the topographic map requirement, leavingit for States to require at their discretion. Another commenter objectedto the requirement for a one-mile radius and also recommended State discretion.One commenter read the proposal to require topographic maps for all sludgemanagement sites and asserted that such a requirement was unreasonableand unnecessary for small sites. Two commenters recommended strengtheningthe requirement. One asked that topographic maps be required for all sitesand not just sources, as most agronomic sites are more than one mile fromthe wastewater treatment plant. The others recommended that applicantsbe required to mark the location of all water bodies, water courses, wells,seeps and springs within a one mile radius of the perimeter of the site(not the source). Today's final rule establishing map requirements differs from the proposedrule in one major way. The map must show the location of all water bodiesand wells used for drinking water, in addition to the location of all sludgemanagement facilities at the treatments works' site. Information aboutdrinking water wells is needed only within a one-quarter mile radius beyondthe property boundaries. Further, only information about drinking waterwells listed in public records or otherwise known to the applicant mustbe submitted. Limiting the information about drinking water wells to existinginformation is consistent with similar requirements in the NPDES and RCRAprograms. (<T3>See</T3> 40 CFR 122.21(f)(7) (NPDES); 40 CFR 270.13(1) (RCRA).) Today's rule does not require all applicants to submit maps identifyingall off-site (i.e., beyond the treatment works boundaries) sludge use ordisposal sites it proposes to use. EPA agrees that maps may be necessaryfor some off-site locations, such as where large quantities of sludge areused or disposed of (e.g., landfills, sludge surface disposal sites, dedicatedland disposal sites and incinerators) or where such information is necessaryto develop adequate permit limits. Maps of disposal sites may indicateproximity to ground water recharge areas or surface waters, which may suggestthe need for special permit limits to protect those areas from contamination.However, under today's rule whether maps for off-site use and disposalsite would be appropriate is left to the discretion of the permitting authority.Today's final rule requires the applicant to submit this type of additionalinformation when requested. As proposed, today's final rule sets a minimum requirement for map dimensions(to which one commenter objected), but retains the size of the requiredmap. A one mile radius has been determined by the Agency to provide sufficientinformation about potential environmental impacts from on-site activitieson adjacent lands to determine appropriate permit conditions. In responseto one comment, the Agency has added the requirement that maps depict waterbodies (including surface waters, seeps, springs, etc.) and known drinkingwater wells within one-quarter mile of the property boundaries becausesludge use and disposal may adversely affect surface water quality andnearby ground waters that may directly affect human health. As noted earlier,this makes the map requirements for sludge similar to requirements in otherEPA programs. Indeed, since most treatment works affected by today's finalrule are subject to the NPDES program, they will be able to meet most ofthe mapping requirements with the maps they prepare for the NPDES permitprogram (andSection; 122.21(f)(7)). Applicants would need only to add informationnot already specifically required, i.e., the location of on-site sludgemanagement facilities. As with NPDES map requirements, applicants shoulduse a standard U.S. Geological Survey map where available (7\1/2\ minuteseries; 15 minute series if the 7\1/2\ minute series is unavailable). The final rules on application requirements also include two minor changesfrom the proposal. First, andSection; 501.15(a)(2)(v), which requires a 1istingof all environmental permits, has been expanded to specifically requiresubmission of any local sludge permits. (See paragraph (a)(2)(v)(I).) Second,proposed andSection; 501.15(a)(2) (vii) would have required the applicantto submit any sludge monitoring data it had which was ``representativeof normal operating conditions at the facility * * *.'' In the final rule,the phrase ``which is representative of normal operating conditions atthe facility'' has been deleted. EPA agrees with the commenter who saidthat all monitoring data, including data gathered under adverse conditions,should be reviewed before determining appropriate permit conditions. Whensubmitting the monitoring data, the applicant should of course indicatethe conditions under which the data was gathered. As noted by one commenter, the requirement to submit monitoring data, ``includingavailable groundwater monitoring data with a description of well locations''does not mean that groundwater monitoring wells are required at all beneficialland application sites that receive sludge. Whether groundwater monitoringwells are required at any particular site will be determined either bythe Part 503 technical standards or by the permitting authority using bestprofessional judgment. When the applicant already has groundwater wellsand monitoring data, the final rule requires the applicant to submit thatdata. In response to a comment, the final rule clarifies that the typeof available groundwater data that an applicant may have, and thus mustbe submitted, includes approximate depth to groundwater. The commenteralso suggested that drilling log data also would be useful for review purposes.When the applicant has such information, it must be submitted with theapplication. Today's final rule, in a revision to andSection; 122.21(p), requires thatpermit applicants must retain all sludge-related application data for fiveyears, or longer if required by 40 CFR Part 503. This revision parallelsandSection; 501.15(a)(3) and is explained in section V.I.6. below. <T3>General permits. </T3>Section 122.28 allows general permits to be issuedto cover a category of discharges within a specified geographic area whenall sources: (1) involve the same or substantially similar type of operations;(2) discharge the same types of wastes; (3) require the same effluent limitationor operating conditions; (4) require the same or similar monitoring; and(5) in the opinion of the Director, are more appropriately controlled undera general permit than under individual permits. Under the circumstances described in andSection; 122.28 for NPDES, generalpermits have the potential to reduce significantly the administrative burdenof issuing individual permits without sacrificing control over the regulatedactivities (and thus environmental quality). To provide the same advantagesfor regulating sludge use and disposal, EPA proposed to amend andSection;122.28 to allow general permits to cover sludge use or disposal practicesunder the same type of circumstances as permits for effluent discharges.Under the proposal, for example, a general permit could be written to coverall facilities that use the same disposal method and are subject to thesame sludge quality requirements and management practices. It would notbe necessary that all facilities covered by the sludge general permit alsoqualify for a general permit covering their effluent discharges. Thus,it would be possible for a facility to be covered by an individual NPDESpermit which regulates its discharges and by a general permit which regulatesits sludge practices. Six commenters addressed the proposal to allow general permits for sludge.Only one commenter, a POTW, objected to general permits on the basis thatsludge regulation typically calls for site-specific conditions. The commentercorrectly notes that general permits are not useful when permit conditionswould need to vary from site to site to implement the applicable standardcorrectly. Under the final rule promulgated today, general permits wouldnot be allowed unless all entities covered by the general permit are subjectto the same or similar permit conditions. Thus, where the sludge regulationsrequire site-specific conditions that vary for each permittee, generalpermits would not be appropriate and individual permits would be required.While general permits may be useful for sludge regulations only in a limitednumber of situations, EPA thinks that the advantages they offer shouldnonetheless be available. For example, several commenters suggested usinggeneral permits for small treatment works in response to the Agency's solicitationof comments on the question of regulating small generators. Three commenters endorsed the use of general permits for sludge regulation.One commenter, however, objected to allowing general permits for ClassI facilities (i.e., pretreatment POTWs) because the reasons for designatinga facility Class I (influent, size, complexity) militate against uniformrequirements necessary for general permits. This objection is similar tothe one discussed in the previous paragraph, as is the response. The rulesdescribing when general permits may be used are sufficient to precludeuse of general permits when they are inappropriate due to different conditionsat the facilities. Therefore, there is no need for the rule also to prohibitgeneral permits for a particular class of facilities. One commenter asked whether EPA intended general permits to be availablefor similar land application projects, on similar soils, and which usesludge that is of similar quality. Since permits are not required for landapplication sites under today's rule, general permits for land applicationsites would not be appropriate. However, the concept of regulating multipleland application sites through one permit issued to the sludge generatingtreatment works is embodied in today's final rule through a provision forapproved land application plans, discussed above in section V.F.2 of thispreamble.<T3>Permit boilerplate and conditions</T3>. Section 122.41 establishes``boilerplate'' conditions which must be included in all NPDES permits,while andSection; 122.44 establishes requirements for developing individuallimits for each permit. The proposed rule contained several revisions tothese sections to accommodate the need to include sludge-related conditionsin permits. Three of the proposed revisions related to the ``permit as a shield'' issueand the fact that under the CWA, compliance with an existing permit wouldnot ``shield'' a permittee from having to comply with an applicable Part503 standard by the statutory deadline. Several commenters objected tothese revisions generally because it would be unfair to require a permitteeto comply with new or additional conditions regarding sludge use or disposalin the middle of a permit term. However, as explained in the above discussionon ``permit as a shield,'' the statute compels compliance with the Part503 standards by set deadlines without exception. At the same time, thestatute requires that the Part 503 standards be included in permits. Toimplement these directives, EPA is promulgating the following revisionsin final form. The first revision addresses the permittee's liability under the CleanWater Act for compliance with the Part 503 regulations. Section 122.41(a)(1)is revised to state that the permittee has a duty to comply with standardspromulgated pursuant to section 405(d) (i.e., Part 503) whether or notthe permit has been modified to incorporate the standard. Including thisprovision in all permits clearly notifies permittees of their potentialliabilities under the Act for violations of section 405. Two other revisions address the modification or revocation and reissuanceof permits during their terms to incorporate Part 503 standards. Section122.44(b) has been revised to authorize the permitting authority to modifythe permit when Part 503 standards are promulgated after permit issuanceif the standards are more stringent than existing permit limits. Similarly,andSection; 122.44(c) is revised to require the permitting authority to includein permits a ``reopener'' clause, stating that the permit may be reopenedto incorporate new section 405 standards under the circumstances describedin andSection; 122.44(b). The final revision to andSection; 122.44(b) differs from the proposed rulein that it authorizes, but does not require, the permitting authority toreopen a permit to incorporate subsequently promulgated Part 503 standards.Ideally, all permits will be modified or revoked or reissued upon promulgationof a Part 503 standard applicable to the permittee's sludge use or disposalpractice, as the most effective way to assure that compliance will be achievedby the statutory deadlines. However, the permitting authority is not likelyto have the resources to modify all permits at the same time. Creatinga mandatory duty to reopen all permits could therefore be meaningless,and could delay giving attention to permittees which present pressing environmentalproblems. Today's final rule allows the permitting authority flexibilityto establish priorities for permit modifications to address the most pressingconcerns first. This approach was supported by State and regulated partycommenters. In all cases, incorporation of an applicable Part 503 standardin permits would have to occur no later than at reissuance of the NPDESpermit. Although permitting authorities have flexibility under today'srule, permittees would still be liable for compliance with Part 503 regulationsby the statutory deadline. Another group of revisions to andSection;andSection; 122.41 and 122.44 relateto permittee monitoring requirements. The proposed revisions covered monitoringmethodologies, frequencies, and reporting forms. As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, current regulationsgenerally require that all monitoring be conducted in accordance with Part136. However, Part 136 methods do not comprehensively address sludge monitoringand analysis. Therefore, to supplement Part 136, the Part 503 standardsmay specify required monitoring methodologies where Part 136 methods areinappropriate. Accordingly, EPA proposed to revise andSection;andSection; 122.41(j)(4),122.41(l)(4)(ii), and 122.44(i)(1)(iii) to state that sludge monitoringmethodologies shall be as specified in Part 503, as well as Part 136. Theone comment on this issue supported these proposed revisions. They remainunchanged in the final rule. The more controversial issue raised by the proposed rule concerned requiredmonitoring frequencies. Current NPDES regulations require that permitscontain requirements for permittee reports of monitoring results at a ``frequencydependent on the nature and effect of the discharge, but in no case lessthan once a year.'' andSection; 122.44(i)(2). EPA proposed to revise thissection to include reporting for sludge monitoring. Thus, the frequencyof reporting sludge monitoring results which must be specified in the permitwould be based on the nature and effect of the permittee's sludge use ordisposal activity. How frequently reporting is appropriate would be determinedby the permit writer's best professional judgment, but must be requiredno less than once a year. The preamble to the proposed rule explained that the Part 503 standardsmay also specify recommended or required monitoring frequencies for variousparameters and practices and that Part 503 was to be followed wheneverapplicable. The proposed Part 503 standards would establish minimum monitoringfrequencies. In all cases, appropriate monitoring frequencies would bedetermined by the permit writer using his or her best professional judgment(i.e., in the absence of Part 503 standards or where the permit writerdetermines that monitoring should be more frequent than the minimum requiredby an applicable Part 503 standard). EPA solicited comments on alternative approaches to setting monitoringfrequencies. Specifically, the Agency asked commenters to address whetherthe regulations should establish minimum monitoring frequencies, and ifso, whether the frequencies should be annually, quarterly, or monthly.EPA acknowledged the advantages of different approaches and explained thatin establishing requirements, the Agency would balance the value of frequentmonitoring for all permittees at regular intervals (early detection ofviolations and thus, potentially greater protection of the environment,and additional support for enforcement actions) against the cost burdenimposed by monitoring requirements on the permittee and the need for monitoringfrequencies tailored to the circumstances of the particular sludge generator.Twenty-three commenters responded to EPA's solicitation of comments onthe question of monitoring frequencies in the 1988 proposal. (Two commenterson the 1986 proposal also requested that EPA establish a minimum monitoringfrequency.) One commenter said that the question of appropriate monitoringfrequencies was a technical issue and therefore should be addressed inthe Part 503 regulations rather than in this rulemaking. About half (mostlyStates) of the commenters directly or indirectly favored the approach embodiedin the proposed rule which would leave the question of appropriate monitoringfrequencies to the permit writer's best professional judgment. One commentersaid that monitoring frequencies should be determined in the MOA. The mostcommonly cited reason for a flexible approach was that various factorsshould be taken into account in making this kind of determination. Amongthe alternatives for a minimum monitoring frequency (with additional monitoringas necessary on a case-by-case basis) discussed in the preamble, five (mostlyPOTWs) favored annual monitoring, one favored quarterly monitoring, onefavored monthly monitoring, and one favored a tiered approach that wouldrequire Class I facilities to monitor monthly, and non-Class I facilitiesto monitor quarterly. Commenters also suggested various factors that shouldbe considered in establishing appropriate monitoring frequencies such asthe size of the facility, the type of disposal option used, and the costto the permittee. After careful consideration of all comments, EPA is promulgating a finalrule which leaves monitoring frequency to the discretion of the permitwriter, but requires at a minimum that monitoring be conducted annually.In addition, today's rule follows the proposal by requiring that the permitteereport monitoring results at least annually (andSection; 124.44(i)(2)). Thus,there would always be at least one monitoring event during the reportingperiod. This helps ensure that the information is reasonably current withoutburdening the permittee.EPA disagrees that the question of appropriate monitoring frequencies issolely a technical issue and therefore is an inappropriate subject fortoday's final rulemaking. Today's rule establishes a framework for a permittingprogram that implements the goals of section 405 and accordingly establishedmany generic requirements for permit conditions. Today's rule requiresthat the appropriate monitoring frequencies be addressed in the permit.EPA agrees that monitoring requirements often involve technical questions.The Part 503 regulations propose minimum monitoring frequencies. To clarifythis point and EPA's intent as discussed in the preamble to the proposedrule, today's rule specifically states that permits must include, at aminimum, any applicable monitoring requirements in Part 503, but in nocase is monitoring to be conducted less frequently than once a year. Otherproposed revisions requiring permit conditions to implement Part 503 standardswould accomplish the same result. However, to avoid any confusion or questionabout this point, EPA has decided to restate the requirement in the regulationspecifically addressing monitoring requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>The final rule addresses sludge monitoring requirementsseparately from effluent monitoring to avoid confusion.</ITAG>Beyond requiring compliance with applicable Part 503 requirements, and,at a minimum, annual monitoring, today's rule leaves the question of monitoringfrequency to the permit writer's judgment. The final rule, in andSection;122.44(i)(1)(iii), clarifies that the permit must contain any monitoringrequirements that are determined to be necessary on a case-by-case basis.The clear message of the comments was that numerous factors affect theappropriate monitoring frequency in any given situation. This supportsa flexible approach. It does not mean that a more frequent schedule ofmonitoring to detect violations is no longer considered a valid goal ofpermittee self-monitoring requirements. However, nothing suggested in thecomments succeeded in convincing EPA that it could establish a greatermonitoring frequency in regulations that would be appropriate for the broadvariety of situations and facilities. Guidance would be more appropriatefor this purpose. Monitoring requirements in permits should yield data that are representativeof the monitored activity (see andSection; 122.48(b)). Size and the potentialfor a permittee's sludge quality to vary will be critical factors in establishingan appropriate frequency. For example, monthly monitoring might be appropriatefor some large POTWs with complex influent. Two commenters stated that an annual priority pollutant scan would be toocostly a burden to place on smaller communities. Similarly, another commenterexpressed concern that an ``excessive'' number of parameters (at an ``excessive''frequency) would be required in the absence of the Part 503 technical standards.Nothing in the proposed or final rule establishes which pollutants shouldbe monitored. Comments addressing the priority pollutant scan apparentlyrefer to a recommendation in EPA's draft interim sludge permitting strategy.This strategy provides guidance on developing permit conditions, includingmonitoring conditions, prior to the promulgation of the Part 503 technicalregulations, and accordingly would provide guidance for implementing today'sfinal rule requiring monitoring conditions in permits that reflect thenature and effect of the regulated activity. EPA's Interim Strategy recommendsannual priority pollutant scans to establish baseline data on sludge quality,and as a means to identify potential use and disposal problems prior todevelopment of the technical standards. However, the Strategy also includedexceptions to this recommendation which recognized that less extensivedata might serve as well in two situations typical of small facilities:Use of wastewater treatment lagoons, and the absence of industrial influent.In addition, it must be remembered that the Interim Strategy serves tohelp identify potential problem facilities, and gives such facilities priorityattention. Thus, the approach defers lesser problems. With the promulgationof the Part 503 technical standards, all facilities to whom the standardsapply must comply with the standards, regardless of their size, numberof industrial users, or other site-specific factors. With regard to monitoringparameters, permittees would, at a minimum, monitor for the pollutantslimited in the Part 503 regulations that apply to that permittee's useor disposal method. Of course, the permit writer would use his best professionaljudgment to determine if monitoring for additional pollutants should berequired in the permit. Two commenters suggested that in some situations, for example, small privately-ownedtreatment works without industrial influent, research or literature analysesof sludge composition should be accepted as a substitute for actual monitoringat individual facilities. EPA disagrees with this approach. Research orliterature analyses on sludge from particular sources can be useful toolsfor determining appropriate monitoring frequencies. However, literaturevalues are not useful for compliance monitoring purposes. Actual monitoringresults are needed to establish compliance status. Relying on literaturevalues would also preclude detection of potentially serious, but unpredictable,problems such as sludge contamination caused by illegal dumping of hazardouswastes or by household or other non-industrial hazardous wastes. For thesereasons, EPA is requiring that monitoring results must be based on actualmonitoring. The proposed rule also addressed how monitoring must be reported. The Agencyproposed to revise andSection; 122.41(1)(4) (i) and (ii) to state that monitoringof sludge use and disposal practices should be reported on forms specifiedby the Director (rather than on the DMR form, which is required for effluentdata reporting under the NPDES program). EPA explained that it was notrequiring use of a uniform reporting form because it had not yet developeda uniform reporting form for the results of permittee monitoring of sludgeactivities. Under the proposed rule, the Director (EPA or an approved State)would be expected to develop forms to elicit the relevant data from thepermittee based on the monitoring and other conditions in the permit. Alternatively,the Director could specify other appropriate forms for reporting monitoringinformation, such as the forms used by the laboratory to report resultsof its analyses. EPA received two comments on this proposed revision. A POTW supported it.The other commenter opposed letting Regions and States develop their ownforms and strongly encouraged EPA to develop national reporting forms forsludge because they would improve the national database for sludge andpromote equitable compliance enforcement and removal credit analysis. EPAagrees that uniform reporting forms could enhance the effectiveness ofdata collected. Accordingly, it is planning to study whether national formsare feasible for the sludge program (which has reporting requirements muchmore varied than those in the NPDES program). Once it is decided that suchforms should be developed, they would be proposed for public notice andcomment. However, EPA is not requiring reporting on such forms at thisstage. One commenter objected to andSection; 122.41(1)(4)(ii), which requires thepermittee to include on self-monitoring reports the results of monitoringdone more frequently than required by the permit. The commenter expressedconcern that this requirement could discourage voluntary monitoring. Thisis not the intent. The requirement to submit all monitoring has been anestablished requirement of the NPDES program for over ten years. It assuresthat self-monitoring reports are representative of the monitored activityand do not represent selected results. The March 1988 proposed rule merelyproposed that this requirement apply as well to sludge monitoring reports(using sludge monitoring methods established or approved in 40 CFR Part503). Since self-monitoring of sludge and related activities fulfills thesame function as self-monitoring under NPDES, there is no apparent reasonfor the requirement to be different for sludge monitoring. Accordingly,the final rule is the same as the proposed. EPA proposed minor wording revisions to various provisions to establishthat the activity or requirement addressed by Part 122 regulations includessludge use and disposal activities as well as effluent discharge activities(e.g., andSection; 122.41(d), ``duty to mitigate''; andSection; 122.64(a)(4),termination of permit when permittee ceases regulated activity). EPA receivedno adverse comments on these proposed revisions and therefore is promulgatingthem in final form. Another proposed revision concerned the compliance schedule provisionsin andSection; 122.47 (and an analogous provision in andSection; 501.15(a)(6)).Section 122.47(a)(3)(i) was proposed to be revised to specify that interimprogress reports on compliance with sludge standards must be required atleast every six months. This called for less time between interim milestonesthan for NPDES compliance schedules because of the relatively short deadlinesin the CWA for compliance with the sludge standards. Today's final ruleis the same as the proposed. EPA received one comment supporting the compliance schedule provision.Two commenters opposed this provision on the grounds that the compliancedeadlines are unrealistic. One commenter suggested that States be givenauthority to determine compliance schedules for individual POTWs on a case-by-casebasis. As explained in section V.B.3 above, the deadlines for compliancewith the Part 503 technical standards were established by Congress in theCWA. Therefore, EPA cannot establish different deadlines through regulations.Where compliance with a Part 503 standard is not an issue (for example,where the permit establishes case-by-case ``interim'' limits), the permittingauthority would have more flexibility in establishing a compliance deadline.However, under today's final rule, compliance must be required as soonas possible. As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, where the existing provisionin the NPDES regulations was broad enough to include a permittee's sludgeactivities as well as its discharge activities, it would apply to bothunless specifically limited. Thus, no revisions to the existing languagein those provisions were proposed because they were not necessary. Thisincludes ``need to halt or reduce activity not a defense'' under andSection;122.41(c); ``proper operation and maintenance'' under andSection; 122.41(e);duty to provide information'' under andSection; 122.41(h); ``inspection andentry'' under andSection; 122.41(i). (Comparable requirements were proposedto be included in the Part 501 regulations and have been included in thefinal rule.) In response to this proposal, a POTW said the boilerplate requirement statingthat the need to halt or reduce the regulated activity would not be a defenseto noncompliance (andSection; l22.41(c); andSection; 501.15(b)(4)) would leavePOTWs with no alternative, and asked EPA whether it planned to providetechnical assistance to POTWs for permit violations beyond the POTW's expertise.This provision does not impose additional liability on permittees. It merelynotifies the POTW that it will be held to strict compliance with its permit,even if it means that the POTW has to cease a particular activity in ordernot to violate the permit. In other words, the POTW cannot argue that itviolated its permit because the only way it could avoid a violation wasto cease or reduce the activity. A permittee will be expected to halt orreduce the regulated activity if it is the only way to achieve compliance.Otherwise, the permittee will be in violation of its permit and the CWA.EPA cannot guarantee technical assistance to POTWs but generally expectsto include technical assistance as a component of the national sludge program.In the meantime, POTWs should take full advantage of whatever assistanceis available to develop new, or strengthen existing, pretreatment programs.Commenters also offered suggestions for adding other permit requirements,based on the NPDES regulations, to the Part 501 regulations. One suggestedaddition was a ``duty to reapply'' analogous to andSection; 122.41(b). EPAagrees that this provision would be useful to include in non-NPDES permitsand therefore is adding it to andSection; 501.15(b)(14). Another suggested addition was a provision specifying when the noncompliancereports required by andSection; 501.15(b)(12)(iv) must be submitted, usingas models andSection; 122.41(l) (6) and (7). EPA agrees with the generalidea of specifying when required reporting must be submitted. However,andSection; 122.41(l) (6) and (7) are generally tailored to specific typesof noncompliance found in the NPDES program and therefore are not the mostappropriate models for the sludge program. Instead, the final rule requiresthat any instances of noncompliance must be reported with the permittee'snext scheduled self-monitoring report or as required by Part 503. See andSection;501.15(b)(12)(iv). The final category of permit regulations discussed in the proposed rulewas existing provisions which were intended to continue to apply exclusivelyto the permittee's discharge activities (i.e., were not intended to applyto sludge permit or sludge condition in permits). In some cases, revisionswere unnecessary to achieve the intended results because the provision,by its own terms, is limited to effluent discharges (e.g., bypass and upsetdefenses (andSection; 122.41(m), (n)); new sources and new dischargers (andSection;122.29)). However, in other cases EPA proposed, and today is finalizing,minor revisions to some provisions to clarify that they apply to dischargeactivities only (e.g., andSection; 122.44(l)(1), reissued permits; andSection;l22.45(b)(1), production-based limits). The most significant provision in this category of regulations that donot apply to sludge use and disposal activities is andSection; 122.44(l)(1),commonly known as the ``antibacksliding'' provision. This means that ifthe permit contains requirements developed on a case-by-case basis (i.e.,based on the permit writer's best professional judgment) under EPA's interimsludge permitting strategy (discussed in section III.C. of this preamble)which are more stringent than subsequently promulgated Part 503 standards,the reissued permit may include requirements based on the less stringentPart 503 standard rather than the more stringent case-by-case interim limit.This would be true not only for pollutant concentration limits, but alsofor monitoring or testing requirements or management practices in Part503. Because the Part 503 standards (and permit conditions implementingthem) must protect public health and the environment from reasonably anticipatedadverse effects, ``backsliding'' from more stringent interim requirementsshould not result in significant public health or environmental effects.<T3>Permit modifications. </T3>Under NPDES, permits may be modified orrevoked and reissued only for cause. Section 122.62 lists the causes forwhich permit modification or revocation and reissuance is deemed permissible.EPA proposed two revisions to this section related to sludge. Both arebeing promulgated as final. First, andSection; 122.62(a)(1) is revised to clarify that a permit may bemodified (or revoked and reissued if the permittee agrees) when there isa change in the permittee's sludge use or disposal practice after permitissuance which would justify the application of different or additionallimits. This revision directly relates to a corresponding revision to requirea permittee to notify the Director of any significant change in sludgeuse or disposal practices under andSection; 122.41(l)(1)(iii) (also promulgatedtoday). These revisions are intended to cover situations where the permitteedecides to switch to a different sludge use or disposal practice differentfrom the one(s) described in the permit application and covered by thepermit. It would not cover situations where the permittee alternates sludgepractices (e.g., depending on the season) and the permit addresses eachalternative.Two commenters objected to requiring permit modifications when the permitteewants to change sludge use or disposal methods. One commenter said permitmodification is unnecessary when the permittee is merely sending its sludgeto a different disposal site permitted under a solid waste program. Thecommenter also suggested that minor modifications be used if no significantimpact to the environment occurs. The other commenter argued generallythat permit modifications for changes in sludge use or disposal methodswas incompatible with well-designed sludge management plans and facilitiesthat employ a variety of use or disposal methods. EPA disagrees with the underlying assumption of the comments that sludgeuse and disposal standards need not be implemented through permits. Congressclearly provided otherwise. EPA also disagrees that minor modificationprocedures are appropriate because whether a particular method may significantlyaffect the environment cannot be determined in advance and without knowledgeabout the permittee's particular situation. However, both situations describedby the commenters can be addressed at the time of permit issuance ratherthan through permit modification. Nothing in today's final rule precludesaddressing more than one sludge use or disposal method in the permit, whetheremployed on a regular basis or as a ``back-up'' method when the primarymeans of sludge use or disposal is unavailable. One commenter said that requiring a permittee to notify the Director ofchanges in its sludge disposal practice was unnecessary since any deviationfrom permit terms would be an obvious violation of the permit. The purposeof the notice provision is not to excuse permit noncompliance, as the commenterseems to assume. Instead, it allows the permittee the flexibility to changeuse and disposal practices if it chooses, but requires the permittee tonotify the permitting authority about any anticipated change in activitywhich may require changes in the permit. Based on this information, thepermitting authority would then have to determine whether or not to requiremodification of the permit in order for the planned activity to occur (i.e,modification would be needed to avoid noncompliance). Therefore, the notificationrequirement serves a useful purpose, both for the permitting authorityand the permittee. An analogous notification provision in the proposed Part 501 rule specifiedthat changes that must be reported included sending sludge to additionaldisposal sites not reported during the permit application process. Thisphrase (with a minor editorial change) has been added to the final revisionsto andSection; 122.41(l)(1)(iii) as well, with the caveat that notificationis not necessary when additional sites are reported pursuant to an approvedland application plan. As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, the finalrule allows treatment works to seek approval of a land application planfor beneficial reuse projects, in lieu of requiring permit modificationeach time the sludge is sent to a previously unidentified site. This caveatappears in both the Part 122 and Part 501 notification provisions and isintended to complete other changes made to the final rule to allow forapproval of land application plans. The second revision would allow permit modification whenever required bya reopener clause to incorporate limits based on new standards for sludgeuse and disposal promulgated in 40 CFR Part 503. (In related revisionspromulgated today, permits may be modified when the new standards are morestringent than existing permit limits (andSection; 122.44(b)) and the permitmust contain a ``reopener'' clause to this effect under andSection; 122.44(c)(4).)This revision authorizes the permitting authority to revise a permit toinclude Part 503 standards. As noted in earlier discussions, a permitteemust comply with any applicable Part 503 standard by the statutory deadlineeven if its permit had not been revised to incorporate the standard. Thisrevision also gives the permittee a basis for requesting modification ofthe permit to eliminate uncertainty about how the standard applies to thepermittee's particular situation, when this is not readily apparent onthe face of the regulation. Another advantage to obtaining specific limitsimplementing a Part 503 requirement is that it would provide the permitteewith a basis for asserting the affirmative defense as provided in andSection;122.5. In addition, EPA is revising andSection; 122.62 by adding a new paragraph(a)(18) to provide for a permit modification to approve a new land applicationplan or revise an existing one. Land application plans are discussed inmore detail above in the discussion about application requirements. One commenter suggested that the regulations also provide for permit modificationwhen there are changes in the permittee's influent ``which result in achange to the applicable sludge regulations.'' The applicability of a particularsludge regulation depends on the use or disposal practice used by the POTWrather than on the characteristic of its influent. Therefore, it is unclearwhy a modification would be needed in this situation. A change in influentcan affect sludge quality and consequently determine whether or not thepermittee is able to comply with its permit limits and continue its chosensludge practice. However, a separate provision to allow modification inthis instance is not necessary because andSection; 122.62(a)(1) (major orsubstantial alterations or additions to the permitted activity) would coverthis situation. Finally, one commenter noted that some of the permit regulations EPA expectedto apply to sludge activities as well as discharge activities were beingchallenged in a pending lawsuit. The commenter, a party to that lawsuit,asked that it be given an additional opportunity to comment if any of thechallenged rules were set aside and remanded. That lawsuit has since beendecided. <T3>See NRDC </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>859 F.2d 156, 28 ERC 1401 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The only NPDESregulation remanded for further Agency action does not apply to sludgeuse or disposal activities. Therefore, additional revisions to today'sfinal rule are not necessary as a result of that litigation. G. Permitting Procedures (Part 124)<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General </ITAG>Part 124 establishes the procedural requirements for issuing, modifying,and terminating permits under several Federal programs, including NPDES.EPA proposed to have the procedural requirements in Part 124 that applyto NPDES permits apply as well to ``sludge-only'' permits authorized bysection 405(f)(2) of the CWA. EPA also proposed revisions to Part 124 basedon the incorporation of requirements addressing sludge conditions in NPDESpermits. Today's rule finalizes proposed revisions to Part 124 with onlyminor changes from the proposal as described below. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Specific Revisions </ITAG><T3>``Sludge-only'' permits. </T3>To make the Part 124 procedures applyto permits issued by EPA to ``sludge-only facilities,'' EPA proposed revisionsto several sections, including andSection; 124.1 (purpose and scope), andSection;124.3 (application for a permit), andSection; 124.71 (applicability of SubpartE governing evidentiary hearings) and andSection; 124.111 (applicabilityof Subpart F governing non-adversary panel proceedings). EPA did not receiveany comments on these proposed revisions. Therefore, the final rule willbe the same as the proposed. As explained in the preamble to the proposedrule, EPA intends these revisions, together with the revisions to Part122 described above, to serve as the requirements and procedures for EPAissuance of permits under section 405(f)(2) of the CWA to treatment workstreating domestic sewage where the Part 503 standards have not been includedin any of the permit programs listed in section 405(f)(1). <T3>NPDES permits. </T3>The other proposed changes to Part 124 addressedthe expanded content of NPDES permits to include requirements for sludgeuse and disposal. Among those proposed changes were revisions to the definitionsof ``applicable standards and limitations,'' ``facility or activity,''and ``general permit.'' The definitions of ``applicable standards and limitations''and ``general permit'' remain unchanged from the proposed rule. The definitionof ``facility or activity'' has been revised slightly in the final ruleto refer to ``treatment works treating domestic sewage'' rather than ``treatmentworks,'' consistent with revisions to the same definition in Part 501.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>The preamble to the proposed rule erroneously stated thata new definition of ``Class I sludge management facility'' was proposedto be added to Part 124. A new definition was not proposed since all definitionsin andSection; 501.2, including the definition of ``Class I sludge managementfacility,'' were proposed to be adopted in Part 124. Today's final ruleincorporates by reference in Part 124 all definitions in Part 501. Therefore,a separate definition of ``Class I sludge management facility'' in Part124 is not needed.</ITAG><T3>Draft permits. </T3>A proposed revision to andSection; 124.6(d)(4) wouldhave required that draft permits include conditions necessary to meet therequirements of standards for sludge use and disposal and any other conditionsrelated to sewage sludge required under andSection;andSection; 122.41, 122.42and 122.44. EPA received no comments on this proposed revision. Today'sfinal rule is the same as the proposal. <T3>Fact sheets. </T3>EPA proposed two changes to the rules governing thepreparation of fact sheets to establish how sludge conditions were to beaddressed. First, a proposed revision to andSection; 124.8 would requirethat fact sheets be prepared for ``Class I sludge management facilities.''A similar requirement appeared in the Part 501 proposed rule (andSection;501.15(d)(4)). One State, commenting on Part 501, said generally that fact sheets anddraft permits are unnecessary and cause delays. EPA disagrees. The purposeof draft permits and fact sheets is to inform the public and the regulatedparty (and EPA in the case of State-issued permits) of the restrictionsthat will be placed on sludge use and disposal practices and the basisfor those limits. This information is needed so that interested partiescan comment intelligently on what the agency proposes. The fact sheet alsodocuments the agency's rationale for its actions on the permit, and thereforeplays a critical function if the permit is subsequently challenged. Preparingthe draft permit and fact sheets undeniably takes time in the short term.However, it can save time over the long term by minimizing questions, objections,and challenges to permits. Therefore, EPA is adopting a final rule thatis the same as the proposed rule. A fact sheet must be prepared for ClassI sludge management facilities, (i.e., POTWs required to have an approvedpretreatment program under 40 CFR 403.8 or any other treatment works treatingdomestic sewage classified as such because of its potential to affect publichealth and the environment adversely). The second proposed revision would require that fact sheets explain how``conditions or standards for sludge use and disposal'' were derived (andSection;124.56(a)) and where the regulated activity or facility is located (andSection;124.56(c)). The purpose of the revision to andSection; 124.56(a) was to requirethat the fact sheet contain an explanation of how sludge limits or conditionswere calculated, whether based on the technical sludge standards (Part503) or on the permit writer's best professional judgment. However, theproposed regulatory language was unclear in this regard and could be readto refer only to sludge limits and conditions based on the Part 503 technicalstandards. To clarify that EPA intends the fact sheet to address BPJ conditionsas well, the final rule also includes a revision to andSection; 124.56(b)to specifically reference conditions developed on a case-by-case or BPJbasis pursuant to section 405(d)(4) of the CWA. <T3>Public notice. </T3>Section 124.10 governs when and how public noticeof permit actions must be made. In the March 1988 proposal, EPA proposedtwo revisions to the public notice requirements. EPA is finalizing thefirst revision unchanged from the proposal since it received no publiccomments objecting to the proposed rule. This revision to andSection; 124.10(c)(1)(ii)requires the permit authority to mail the public notice of a permit actionto any agency known to have issued or be required to issue a sludge managementpermit or ocean dumping permit for the same facility or activity. The second proposed revision to andSection; 124.10 would require the publicnotice to describe the location of each sludge management facility (includingdisposal sites) and disposal or use practice (andSection; 124.10(d)(1)(vii)).Commenters on similar provisions in Part 501 objected to requiring publicnotice of each agricultural land application site where sludge is beneficiallyreused either because those sites may not be known at the time of the permitissuance or because subsequent notice for each site would jeopardize aland application program through delays which would interfere with cropcycles and other circumstances affecting agricultural use. In response to these comments, today's final rule specifies that only useor disposal sites known at the time of permit application must be describedin the public notice. As discussed in section V.F.2. above, today's final rule also providesfor land application plans where the sludge generator is unable to identifyall future beneficial use sites that will be used during the permit term.Today's rule establishes minimum procedural requirements for land applicationplans, but does not require full-scale permit modification procedures foreach new land application site. The land application plan itself, developedas part of the permit, would establish the procedures that must be followedbefore sludge could be applied to previously unidentified sites. To ensurethat the public has a meaningful opportunity to comment on all aspectsof the land application plan, today's final rule includes several revisionsto Part 124 (and corresponding provisions in Part 501). First, andSection;124.8(a) has been revised to require a fact sheet whenever a permit includesa sewage sludge land application plan. (See also andSection; 501.15(d)(4).)Thus, where a non-``Class I sludge management facility'' has a land applicationplan, there must be a fact sheet. Second, the publication of the publicnotice must be co-extensive with the geographical area covered by the landapplication plan (andSection; 124.10(c)(2)(i); andSection; 501.15(d)(5)(ii)(B)).Third, the public notice must indicate that a land application plan isa part of the proposed permit (andSection; 124.10(c)(2)(i); andSection; 501.15(d)(5)(iii)(A)(<T3>3</T3>)). Fourth, the fact sheet must briefly describe how each requiredelement of the land application plan listed in andSection; 501.15(a)(2)(ix)is addressed in the proposed permit (andSection; 124.56(e); andSection; 501.15(d)(4)(i)(C)).Some commenters objected to any public notice because it could triggera ``not-in-my-back-yard'' or ``NIMBY'' public response which could defeatattempts to beneficially reuse sewage sludge, no matter how environmentallysafe it might be. EPA is aware that public opposition to beneficial reusemay not always be justified by environmental risks. However, EPA does notview withholding information as an appropriate response to public concernsabout sewage sludge use and disposal. Instead, as noted by several commenters,public education concerning the potential benefits and risks of sludgereuse is needed. <T3>Permit termination after approval of State programs. </T3>Finally,EPA today is revising andSection; 124.5(d) to allow EPA to terminate a permitin the course of transferring permit responsibility to an approved Stateunder andSection; 501.14(b)(1) without having to issue a notice of intentto terminate (and without following the procedures applicable to draftpermits). (Note: Although the preamble to the proposed rule indicated thatthis revision to andSection; 124.5(d) was being proposed, the proposed revisedlanguage was inadvertently omitted from the March 9, 1988 notice.) No commentswere received on the proposed revision. Accordingly, the final rule isthe same as the proposed rule.H. State Program Requirements: General Today's final rule establishes the minimum requirements for approved Statesludge management programs and procedures for approving, revising, andwithdrawing approval of State programs. As proposed, a State may administeran approved sludge management program as part of an NPDES program or asa non-NPDES program. State programs are optional. If a State does not obtainprogram approval, EPA will be responsible for ensuring that the technicalsludge standards are implemented through permits issued to POTWs or othertreatment works treating domestic sewage in that State. In developing the final rule, EPA relied on the authority and program directionprovided in the Clean Water Act amendments of 1987. Except in very generalterms, the 1987 amendments do not give EPA much direction on fashioningState program procedures and requirements. However, Congress provided someclearly articulated general principles. In section 405(f)(1), Congressdirected EPA to promulgate procedures for approving State programs that``assure compliance with any applicable requirements of (section 405 ofthe CWA).'' The legislative history further states that ``approved programsmust have substantive standards at least as stringent as those containedin the 405(d) guidelines.'' Sen. Rep. No. 99-50 at 47 (May 14, 1985). <T3>See also </T3>132 Cong. Rec. H10576 (October 15, 1986). EPA's expectations for approvable State programs are contained in Part501, which applies to non-NPDES State programs. EPA used the February 1986proposed rule as the basis for much of the March 1988 Part 501 proposal.For the permitting requirements and procedures which became necessary afterCongress determined that the sludge technical regulations were to be implementedthrough a permit, EPA used the NPDES program regulations as the model fortwo reasons. First, those regulations reflect over fifteen years of experienceand growth in a successful program. Second, the Act provides for implementationof the technical sludge standards through NPDES permits and approved StateNPDES permit programs. Equity and consistency support similar requirementsfor non-NPDES programs. A State sludge program may be administered as part of an existing Stateprogram (e.g., the State solid waste management plan) or it may be a separatesection 405 sludge program, so long as it meets the requirements of thePart 501 regulations. States are, of course, free to adopt more stringentor more extensive requirements under section 510 of the CWA. State programswill be reviewed for their ability to meet the requirements of the Actand to ensure that there are no State provisions which may undercut orhinder implementation of the program, such as provisions authorizing variancesfrom Federal technical standards. Today's final rule also establishes the additional requirements that approvedNPDES State programs would have to meet to be approved under section 405(f).The requirements are contained in the revisions to 40 CFR Part 123. Today'srule adds relatively few new requirements for States with existing NPDESprograms. This assumes that the existing Part 123 requirements are broadenough to cover sludge requirements. Therefore, an NPDES State which seeksapproval under section 405 would have to demonstrate through an applicationfor program modification that its program covers implementation of sludgerequirements to the same extent as other NPDES permitting activities andalso covers activities unique to sludge management. Although a State may choose to seek approval of its sludge management programunder Part 123 (as part of its NPDES program) or Part 501 (as a non-NPDESprogram), the basic requirements for approval under either Part are thesame. Maintaining consistency among State program requirements will helpensure that minimum standards apply nationwide, regardless of which programa State chooses for its sludge management program. The purpose of the programrequirements under both parts is to produce programs which adequately ensurecompliance with section 405(d) and meet the Congressional goal of approvingState programs which are no less stringent than the Federal program. The State program discussion first examines general issues, followed bya section-by-section analysis of Part 501 and revisions to Part 123. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. </ITAG>Need for Regulations and EPA Approval of State Programs Regulations establishing minimum requirements applicable to all Statesthat administer an EPA-approved sludge program are necessary to ensurethat the environmental goals of the program as envisioned by Congress willbe met nationwide. These regulations provide for consistency and uniformityamong programs, which promotes equitable treatment for regulated partiesand integrity of the national program. Meeting these objectives demandsa fairly rigorous approval process and close scrutiny of the State's program.One commenter suggested that instead of requiring States to obtain programapproval, that all sludge use and disposal be regulated through existingCWA programs: NPDES States would simply include sludge conditions intoNPDES permits, while non-NPDES States would use the section 401 certificationprocess to integrate their sludge programs into CWA programs. This suggestedapproach is not supported by the CWA. First, section 405(f) clearly providesfor approved State programs. (A similar argument that NPDES States mustrevise their NPDES programs to include sludge regulation is discussed belowin section V.H.3.) Second, the purpose of the section 401 State certificationprocess is to advise EPA of conditions that are needed to implement Statewater quality criteria and standards so they can be incorporated into EPA-issueddischarge permits. Congress did not amend section 401 to provide for sludgeuse and disposal as contemplated by the commenter. Further, it is unclearhow the section 401 certification process, which addresses State requirements,would be useful for implementing the section 405(d) technical standardsas required by the CWA. (For similar reasons, another commenter's suggestionthat both NPDES and non-NPDES States should be able to incorporate Statesludge requirements into federally-enforceable permits is inappropriate.)A consortium of State sludge management agencies commented that EPA approvalof State programs was important only for States without existing effectiveState sludge management programs, and that for States with effective programs,EPA's role should be that of facilitation, technical and financial assistance,research support, and information gathering. This commenter did not suggestreliable means or criteria for determining into which category a Statewould fall. Indeed, that is a major purpose of the approval process establishedin today's regulation. To obtain approval, States are asked to demonstratethat they have effective programs and that they can implement the Federalstandards. EPA cannot responsibly fulfill its obligations under the CleanWater Act to approve State programs that assure compliance with section405 without such information. For similar reasons, the ``diversion'' ofresources from regulatory activities to undertake the approval processthat some commenters noted, is largely unavoidable.Some commenters suggested alternatives to the formal approval process setforth in the proposed rule, that shifts the burden of information gatheringand synthesis from the States to EPA. One commenter said that the adequacyof State programs could be determined through audits and oversight ratherthan through formal submissions (again for those States with existing effectiveprograms). Another suggested that EPA undertake field audits and use checkliststo gather information about State programs rather than requiring the Stateto submit documentation of their programs to EPA. Another suggested ``self-certification.''These methods, while useful, are more suited to ensuring that approvedState programs continue to implement adequate programs than to determiningwhether such programs are adequate at the outset. Shifting the entire burden of gathering information of the State's programto EPA would be inefficient. States are in the best position to gatherinformation about their programs, especially if their sludge program isscattered among several agencies. Similarly, the State's Attorney Generalis the most authoritative source on State law. Even though EPA believesthat States must continue to bear the major burden of documenting the adequacyof their programs, EPA will try to streamline the process and develop modeldocuments to minimize time spent on developing program submission. In addition,the Agency plans to undertake informal program reviews to assist Statesin evaluating their programs to determine what changes would be neededto meet the approval requirements. Finally, EPA also has made numerouschanges in specific requirements like the inventory (often cited as themost resource intensive of the requirements) and the list of bans and prohibitionsto ease the burden on States. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Required Scope of Approved State Programs </ITAG>Section 501.1(d) requires that States have authority to regulate all sludgemanagement activities that may be practiced in the State (except that disposalof sewage sludge considered to be a hazardous waste under Subtitle C ofRCRA need not be a part of a State's program under today's rule). Thisincludes a range of sludge treatment and processing activities (plus relatedactivities such as transportation and storage) and specific sludge useand disposal practices (e.g., land application, landfill, distributionand marketing, incineration, and any other sludge use and disposal practices,other than ocean dumping, as may be covered by federal regulations). Forrelated activities, such as transportation and storage, the State neednot demonstrate a comprehensive regulatory scheme. For example, Statesare not expected to have a manifest system for the transportation of sewagesludge. What is needed, however, is a showing that the authority existsto regulate these activities, as needed, to protect public health and theenvironment. Unlike the proposed rule, today's final rule does not attempt to list allsludge management activities or practices that future federal regulationsmay address and that a State must be able to regulate. Instead, the finalrule simply retains the general reference to ``sludge treatment, processingand short term storage practices as may be covered by federal regulations.''In some cases this section covers activities which will not be coveredby the first round of the Part 503 technical standards (e.g., transportation,storage, treatment). However, States are still required to have the authorityto regulate these activities in the event that subsequent rounds of Part503 may regulate them, and because even in the absence of applicable Part503 standards, States must have authority to take appropriate measuresto protect public health and the environment from the adverse effects ofsludge use or disposal comparable to EPA's authority under section 405(d)(4)of the CWA (andSection; 501.1(c)(4)). Consistent with section 313(a) of the CWA, the State's approved programmust also apply to federal facilities to the same extent as to other entitieswithin the State. This requirement was stated explicitly in the 1986 proposal(proposed andSection; 501.15(b) introductory language), but was inadvertentlyomitted in the 1988 proposal. (The reference to federal facility compliancein andSection; 501.1(c)(i) clearly signalled the Agency's intent, however.)To clarify that federal facilities are covered, the final rule reinstatesthe explicit requirement that ``The State sludge management program shallalso be applicable to all federal facilities in the State.''<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>State NPDES programs are already required to cover federalfacilities within the State.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In addition, the definition of ``treatment works treating domesticsewage'' in andSection;andSection; 501.2 and 122.2 has been revised to specificallyinclude federal facilities. One commenter on the 1986 proposal said that the federal facility requirementwas inadequate, given problems States have encountered in gaining accessto federal facilities (particularly military installations which resiston national security grounds), and argued that the regulations should requireStates to demonstrate workable procedures to ensure access to federal facilities,guarantee federal facility compliance with all permitting, monitoring,and reporting requirements, and be subject to the same enforcement actionsas non-federal facilities. The commenter further stated that EPA shouldassume responsibility for enforcement whenever States encounter resistancefrom federal facilities. EPA disagrees that additional regulations arenecessary because today's final rule already requires that federal facilitiesbe covered under an approved State program to the same extent as otherentities. To require more, as suggested by the commenter, would be essentiallymeaningless and would not be an appropriate way to deal with the situationsdescribed by the commenter. Although States will be required to have general authority to regulatethese types of activities, they would not be expected to have specificregulations or the program capacity necessary to carry out such regulationsuntil after the sludge technical regulations have been promulgated. RequiringStates to have broad legal authority at the outset, however, minimizesthe need for subsequent statutory changes, which may take up to two years(see andSection; 501.32), in order to have authority to implement new federalregulations. Minimizing delays in State programs' ability to implementnew federal sludge use and disposal requirements is particularly importantbecause the CWA requires compliance with any new regulations within oneyear after promulgation (or within two years if the regulations requireconstruction).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Mandatory v. Optional Programs </ITAG>Under today's final rule, State sludge management programs are optional.All NPDES permits must contain the sludge standards mandated by CWA section405(d) unless they are addressed under another Federal permit or a permitissued pursuant to an approved State sludge program. If the State doesnot have an approved program, EPA will implement the standards either throughan NPDES permit (when it is the NPDES permit authority) or through a ``sludgeonly'' permit authorized by section 405(f)(2) of the CWA. Giving States the option to choose whether to seek program approval representsa significant departure from the February 4, 1986 proposal which wouldhave required States to develop and submit sludge programs to EPA for approvalas part of the continuing planning process required under section 303(e).EPA abandoned the mandatory program approach because in the 1987 amendmentsto the Clean Water Act Congress authorized, but did not expressly mandate,that States develop section 405 sludge programs. In contrast, when Congressamended the Clean Water Act in 1977 and added requirements to develop pretreatmentprograms, it expressly mandated that States with existing NPDES programsmodify those programs to add pretreatment authority. EPA interprets thisfailure to require States to obtain EPA approval of their sludge programsto mean that Congress intended State programs to be optional. At the time of the 1986 proposed rule, State programs were the only availablevehicle for implementing a comprehensive sludge management program sincethe Federal statutes that established technical requirements for sludgeuse and disposal did not specify Federal implementation mechanisms. Thistoo, changed with the 1987 amendments to the Clean Water Act authorizingEPA to issue permits in the absence of approved State programs. This schemeestablishing Federal and State roles in the sludge management program issimilar to the NPDES program where State programs are also optional. Thisis another reason for concluding that State sludge management programsunder section 405(f) should be optional. However, as stated in EPA's 1984``Policy on Municipal Sludge Management,'' it is EPA's policy that sludgemanagement is a local concern and thus should be handled at the State andlocal level, within the context of broadly-established national objectivesand standards. Section 101(b) of the CWA also encourages States to playa primary role in the implementation of the CWA programs. Therefore, EPAwill encourage the States to develop approvable sludge programs, throughsuch mechanisms as the continuing planning process and section 106 workprogram development. Most commenters on this issue supported optional, rather than mandatory,State programs. Reasons given for supporting optional programs includedthe unreliability of Federal and State funding for State sludge programs,uncertainty about what the technical standards will require, questionablelegal basis for mandating State programs under the CWA (particularly beforethe 1987 amendments), and the importance of handling sludge at the Stateand local level. Support for mandatory State programs was similarly varied. One State supportedmandatory programs, contingent upon availability of Federal funding. Unfortunately,EPA cannot guarantee this. One commenter supported mandatory State programsbecause ``States are more familiar with facilities and regional concernsthan EPA.'' EPA agrees that State programs are preferable for this reasonbut does not think it provides a sufficient basis for making State programsmandatory. Another commenter said State programs should be mandatory because``States require guidance and minimum standards for compliance monitoring.''EPA agrees that establishing minimum standards for approvable State programsis necessary, but again does not think that this provides a sufficientbasis for mandating State programs. Where States are unable or unwillingto meet the minimum standards, the standards will be met through the Federalpermitting program. One commenter, an environmental group, argued that EPA must require allStates to have sludge management programs to plan for sludge use and disposalthroughout the State pursuant to section 303(e), even if sludge permittingprograms under section 405(f) were not mandatory. Essentially, the commenterargues that EPA cannot abandon the rationale for requiring State programswhich it used as the primary basis for proposing State program regulationsinitially in 1986, i.e., that sludge management programs would be a partof the continuing planning process required of all States under section303(e). EPA disagrees. In 1986, section 303(e) was the strongest basisavailable for establishing State programs and it did not readily adaptto an optional approach. The 1987 amendments, however, contained comprehensiveprovisions for sludge management and provided a more explicit basis anddifferent approach for establishing State sludge management programs. Inthis context, EPA thinks it is appropriate to follow the Congressionallead in the 1987 amendments and make State sludge programs optional. Nothingin the 1987 amendments suggested that Congress intended to distinguishbetween management and permitting programs. Because EPA has decided to make State programs optional, rather than mandatory,several provisions from the 1986 proposal are no longer applicable. Accordingly,EPA has not responded to comments on these provisions in promulgating thefinal rule. These provisions include one specifying a two year deadlinefor States to apply for program approval and a waiver for ``quasi-States''(e.g., the District of Columbia). The same commenter that argued that all States must be required to haveEPA-approved sludge management programs also argued that States with approvedNPDES programs must be required to obtain approval of their sludge permittingprograms. The commenter offered three basic reasons in support. First,control over sludge use and disposal is an integral part of the pretreatmentprogram and thus of NPDES permits. Therefore, States which issue NPDESpermits must be able to regulate sludge use and disposal. Second, the 1987amendments reinforce this interpretation in section 405(f)(1) by statingthat `` `any permit issued under section 402 * * * shall include requirementsfor the use and disposal of sludge that implement the regulations establishedpursuant to subsection (d) * * *' '' and that exceptions to this requirementare to be narrowly defined. Finally, the commenter argued that the CWAhas always required sludge use and disposal to be addressed in NPDES permitsunder section 405 (a)-(c). The rationale behind these arguments appearsto be that using NPDES permits to implement sludge requirements is themost sensible way to integrate sludge and pretreatment requirements. EPA agrees that using the NPDES permit that also contains pretreatmentrequirements to control sludge use and disposal is a logical way to coordinatethese closely linked activities. However, it does not follow that thisis the only approach allowed under the Clean Water Act. On the contrary,the CWA embodies a flexible approach with regard to sludge permitting.Section 405(f)(1) requires conditions to implement the sludge technicalstandards in NPDES permits only if those standards have not been includedin permits issued under certain other programs, including State programsthat have been approved by the Administrator as adequate to assure compliancewith section 405. Thus, the Act recognizes that the sludge requirementscould be in a variety of permits and designates NPDES permits as the ``backup''permit implementation of the sludge standards.POTWs that are required to have approved pretreatment programs will stillbe required to comply with the sludge standards and to develop local limitsor take other measures as part of their pretreatment program to assurecompliance with those standards regardless of what kind of permit the Stateuses to implement the sludge technical standards. Coordination may be moredifficult when these related activities are regulated through differentprograms, but flexibility for state programs and minimizing disruptionto existing non-NPDES programs are equally important goals. A few commenters asked for clarification about EPA's role when an approvedNPDES State does not have an approved sludge management program under section405(f). One State commenter feared that undue disruption to existing Statesludge and NPDES programs would result if EPA were to issue and enforcesludge permits in an approved NPDES State. Another State commenter, however,specifically endorsed this approach as nondisruptive to existing StateNPDES programs because it would allow them to continue issuing NPDES dischargepermits even if the State does not have an approved sludge program. A POTWexpressed concern that its ability to continue disposing of sludge wouldbe jeopardized if its State did not have an approved program and that itmay be required to obtain both State and Federal sludge permits. In the absence of an approved State sludge program, EPA will be responsiblefor issuing permits to treatment works treating domestic sewage that implementthe sludge technical standards even if the State has an approved NPDESprogram. This approach follows from determining that Congress intendedEPA-approved State sludge programs to be optional, even in NPDES States.Therefore, dual permitting under State and Federal programs is possible.While this may be perceived by some as disruptive to existing State programs,the alternative of making State sludge programs mandatory was viewed byEPA (and implied by commenters who favored the optional approach) to bemore disruptive. Permittees' liability for compliance with the sludge technical standardsissued pursuant to section 405(d) of the CWA will be the same regardlessof whether EPA or an approved State issues the permit. The CWA does notprohibit sludge disposal without a permit (as it does for effluent discharges),so a treatment works' ability to continue disposing of sludge should notbe jeopardized by the absence of an approved State program or by the lackof a permit. However, under today's rule, treatment works must apply fora permit within the time frames established by today's rule (see andSection;andSection;122.21(c)(2) and 501.15(d)(1)(ii)) and must comply with any technical standardsapplicable to its sludge use or disposal method(s) by the compliance deadlinesestablished in the technical regulations. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Partial Programs. </ITAG>In the proposed rules, EPA asked for comments on whether partial Statesludge programs should be allowed where a particular State agency had responsibilityfor regulating a particular use or disposal method, and the State onlysought to administer this portion of the program (for example, the StateAir office regulating sludge incinerators, but no other sludge use anddisposal method). The 1988 proposal did not provide any regulatory languageaddressing partial program approvals, stating that the regulatory languagewould be included in the up-coming proposal to revise the NPDES regulations.A similar, somewhat analogous provision appeared in the earlier, February4, 1986 proposed rule. In that notice, EPA proposed to allow a State torequest program approval for less than a complete sludge management programif the State submitted a general plan and schedule to implement a completeprogram within five years of the effective date of the regulation. Therewere nine commenters on this phased-in approval approach: seven States,one environmental group, and one association. It is important to note thatthe 1986 proposal would have <T3>required </T3>States to develop and obtain approval of a sludge program(whereas under the 1988 proposal, State sludge programs would be optional).It is within the context of requiring sludge programs that the commentersresponded. Six of the nine commenters supported the phase-in approach.One supporter (a State) added a condition that compliance monitoring andreporting be included as minimum program elements. Another State addeda caveat that the largest generators should be controlled first, and thatthe elements of a State program which comply with federal requirementsshould be the minimum components necessary for immediate implementation.Three commenters opposed the phased-in approach, expressing concern thatthe regulation provided an unreasonably long schedule for program developmentand thus there would be no incentive for State compliance. One State expressedconcern that funding would drop out after the first two years. There were six commenters on partial program approvals in response to theMarch 1988 proposal: five States and one environmental group. The fiveStates all recommended that EPA allow partial State program approvals,on the basis that it provides greater flexibility in adapting the new federalregulations to existing State programs, and enables the State to targetlimited resources. Two of the States recommended that the issue be dealtwith in the Part 501 regulations, rather than in the general NPDES proposal.One State commenter suggested that a State be allowed to seek delegationof the sludge program for existing NPDES effluent permittees, but thatEPA be allowed to issue ``sludge-only'' permit. Another State commenterexpressed the view that partial program approval should be allowed if aparticular State agency has responsibility for regulating a particularsludge use and disposal method. This approval should be based on whetherthe particular State agency has the authority and resources to regulatethe sludge management facilities under its jurisdiction consistent withthe relevant provisions of the 40 CFR Part 503 technical regulations whenpromulgated. The remaining commenter opposed allowing partial State sludge programs,principally on the basis that section 402(n) of the Clean Water Act allowspartial programs, under certain conditions, for programs regulating dischargesto navigable waters, not for the use and disposal of sewage sludge. Thiscommenter expressed the view that State sludge programs should only beallowed as part of an NPDES program, on the basis that sludge regulationcannot effectively occur without NPDES and pretreatment integration. Therefore,sludge programs should be partially delegated only as a required elementof a State NPDES program. With regard to circumstances where an alternativepermitting program was used (such as the Clean Air Act), the appropriateprovision would be proposed andSection; 501.3, which would provide for coordinationamong the various permit programs to protect against duplicative permitcoverage. The commenter also expressed the view that the ``major category''of dischargers to navigable waters would cover all POTWs and other treatmentworks treating domestic sewage, and that the program must cover in a completefashion all such facilities. The preamble discussion to the proposed rule stated that the issue of partialsludge programs would be discussed in the proposed revisions to the NPDESregulations. Also, the March 1988 proposal did not contain any regulatorylanguage for partial sludge programs. Thus, while it would be simpler andfaster to simply finalize the partial program issue in today's notice,EPA feels that this might unfairly compromise those individuals who wererelying on having additional opportunity to comment when the general revisionsto the NPDES regulations are proposed. Accordingly, today's notice containsonly one provision addressing partial programs: Section 501.1(d)(1) providesthat a State seeking approval of its sludge program pursuant to section501 (i.e., the State is not using NPDES authority) may submit a partialprogram to be approved by EPA to the same extent as a State seeking approvalof its sludge program under Part l23 (i.e., as a modification of its NPDESprogram). The proposed revisions to the NPDES regulations will containa specific discussion and proposed regulatory language for Part 123 onpartial sludge programs that will therefore apply to 501 sludge programsas well. Comments received from both the March 9, 1988 and February 4,1986 proposed rules on the issue of partial sludge programs will be consideredagain and addressed in the rule revising the NPDES regulations. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Mixed Programs </ITAG> Because the proposed regulations provided for approval of NPDES and non-NPDESState sludge programs (as well as the potential for partial program approval),several commenters raised questions about ``mixed'' programs (i.e., combinationsof NPDES and non-NPDES programs in one State), and asked for clarificationon how ``mixed'' programs should be implemented. One State read the proposedrule to require both NPDES and non-NPDES State program approvals wherethe State's NPDES program does not currently cover non-discharging POTWs(or where such facilities are regulated under another State program). Similarly,one State asked whether a State with an approved NPDES program would haveto seek separate (non-NPDES) program approval for facilities such as landdisposal sites not currently regulated under the State's NPDES program.Another State generally asked whether a State could regulate differentrequired State program elements under different programs, such as NPDESand RCRA. A group of POTWs specifically endorsed this approach. As explained in the above discussion about optional versus mandatory Stateprograms, EPA has attempted wherever possible to provide flexibility toStates, particularly with regard to the organization of State programs.EPA has also sought to minimize the differences between the Part 501 andPart 123 requirements so that States can choose freely an approach thatbest suits their existing organization and needs. Whether a State shouldseek approval of an NPDES or non-NPDES sludge program is left to the State'sdiscretion. With very few exceptions, such as the conflict-of-intereststandard for NPDES permitting bodies mandated by section 304(i) of theCWA and the requirement that all State agencies administering the NPDESprogram have statewide jurisdiction over a class of activities in andSection;123.22(b), the requirements would be the same. Because the sludge permitting requirements will apply to many treatmentworks that now have NPDES permits, EPA expects that States with existingNPDES programs would find modifying their existing NPDES program and authoritiesthe most sensible approach. To accomplish this modification, NPDES Stateswould have to amend their NPDES legal authorities to include provisionsfor sludge management regulation that ensure compliance with section 405requirements, in much the same way as EPA has in today's final revisionsto Parts 122 and 124, and submit modifications of existing NPDES programdocuments to meet new requirements in revisions to Part 123. Where a Statechooses to use a non-NPDES program to regulate sludge, it must follow theapproval procedures in Part 501. The difference between using Part 123or Part 501 is critical primarily in ascertaining how much documentationa State must submit to show that its program satisfies section 405 andthe program requirements in today's rule. Theoretically, separate approved Part 501 and Part 123 sludge programscould co-exist in a State only if each program receives approval as a partialprogram. Although EPA agrees that flexibility is an important goal, thefragmentation of sludge regulation and increased number of State programsto oversee that would result from allowing separate approved Part 501 andPart 123 sludge programs argues against this approach as potentially inefficientand confusing to the regulated community. As discussed above, the questionof partial programs under both programs will be considered together inforthcoming regulations (including whether and how partial sludge programsshould be allowed). <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Small Generators  </ITAG>The March 1988 proposal solicited comments on alternative ways to permitnumerous small facilities (for example, non-discharging, privately-owneddomestic sewage treatment works) not previously regulated under any existingState or Federal program other than through individual permits so as tominimize the additional resources that would be needed to fulfill the permittingrequirement. EPA also encouraged States to submit any data they have onthe number of such facilities in their States and the amount and kind ofsludge they produce. One commenter argued that EPA should not even consider alternative waysto regulate small facilities, such as general permits or rules of generalapplicability, without a complete inventory of these facilities and dataon their sludge quality. The commenter's concern was that by proposingalternative approaches, the Agency assumed that these facilities posedlittle or no risk. This is not the case. Whether an alternative, such asa general permit, is appropriate in a particular situation would dependon the facts in that particular situation. Seven State agencies also submittedcomments on this issue, suggesting different ways to approach regulatingsmall entities. Three States suggested that EPA should provide a <T3>de minimis </T3>exemption for small generators. Without clear statutoryauthority to provide such exemptions, however, the Agency prefers to avoidthis approach. Also, as noted above, the Agency does not take the position,absent data, that small facilities pose no risks. Therefore, the Agencycannot justify adopting this approach. However, it should be noted thatmany small generators who send their sludge to POTWs for treatment (i.e.,small package plants) will not be subject to the Part 503 standards andtherefore would not be required to have a permit to implement those standards.Also, as discussed in section V.D.2, owners and operators of septic tanksare not required to obtain permits under today's final rule because septictanks are not considered to be ``treatment works treating domestic sewage''for purposes of section 405(f) of the CWA. This answers the concerns ofone State which anticipated a significant resource burden if permits wererequired for single family residences. Two commenters suggested tailoring permit conditions and procedures tothe size of the facilities to minimize the burden on small facilities.This is possible under today's final rule. As one commenter noted, theNPDES permit program is already flexible in this regard by allowing testingand monitoring requirements to be determined according to site-specificconditions such as the size of the facility. The same flexibility is apart of the sludge permitting program under today's final rule. Other requirements,such as application information that must be submitted, are also likelyto be less for small facilities than for larger facilities, because thesystems are less complex. Similarly, certain permit procedures apply onlyto Class I Sludge Management facilities, which are likely to be largerfacilities.One commenter suggested phasing-in coverage of the program, beginning withmunicipalities and then addressing the small industrial or sewage treatmentpackage plants. This occurs in two ways under today's final rule. First,permits generally will not be required for non-POTWs until a Part 503 standardapplicable to the facility has been promulgated. Thus, industrial facilitieswhich treat domestic sewage and industrial wastes together will not berequired to obtain permits (or have sludge conditions included in existingpermits) immediately because, under current Agency plans, sludge from thesefacilities will not be covered by the first round of Part 503. (Permitsor other measures could be required, however, on a case-by-case basis ifthe Director determines that the facility's sludge may adversely affectpublic health or the environment under the authority of section 405(d)(4)of the CWA. These sludges would also be subject to RCRA regulations assolid wastes, as they are under existing law.) More generally, today'sfinal rule gives the permitting authority discretion to establish permittingpriorities (based on potential harm to public health or the environment)in determining when to incorporate Part 503 standards once those standardshave been promulgated. (See the discussion below on permit reopeners.)One commenter suggested that general permits be used for ``boilerplatetype situations'' that require minimum review, such as lime stabilizationunits for treating septage and portable toilet pumpings prior to land application.Another commenter also suggested the use of general permits in limitedsituations. General permits allow similar facilities requiring similarrequirements to be covered by one general permit rather than by individualpermits. Whether they are appropriate in any given case, of course, cannotbe determined in advance. However, EPA agrees that general permits maybe a useful tool in the sludge permitting program. Accordingly, revisionsto the NPDES general permit regulations to allow for their use to regulatesludge use and disposal have been adopted as a part of today's final ruleand are discussed in section V.F.2 above. States may also be approved toissue general permits for sludge use and disposal. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Indian Tribes </ITAG>In the 1987 amendments to the CWA, Congress authorized Indian Tribes tobe treated as States for purposes of administering an approved NPDES program.See section 518. (This would include NPDES programs that include sludgemanagement programs approved under 40 CFR Part 123 as adequate to assurecompliance with section 405 of the CWA.) Regulations to implement thisauthorization are being developed in a separate rulemaking. In the March 1988 proposal, EPA proposed to authorize Indian Tribes tobe treated as States for purposes of administering <T3>non</T3>-NPDES sludge management programs under section 405 as well.Thus, the March 1988 proposal created a potentially larger role for IndianTribes than the February 4, 1986 proposed rule. (That proposal would haveprovided that EPA and a tribal government could develop, on a case-by-casebasis, an appropriate role for the tribal government in carrying out asludge management program on Indian lands where the federal governmentadministers the program. See proposed andSection; 501.19, 51 FR 4468.) In the 1988 proposal of Part 501, EPA proposed treating Indian Tribes asStates for purposes of <T3>non</T3>-NPDES section 405(f) sludge management programs even thoughsection 518(e), which addresses the status of Indian Tribes under the CWA,does not specifically list section 405 as a program for which EPA may treatan Indian Tribe as a State. EPA reasoned that omission of section 405 fromsection 518 was the result of oversight, not of deliberation. EPA advancedtwo basic reasons in support of this position. First, section 518 authorizedtreating Indian Tribes as States for other sludge management activities,e.g., Title II (construction grants) and section 303 (water quality standardsand implementation plans). Second, section 518 would clearly allow IndianTribes to be treated as States for purposes of administering an approvedNPDES program (including sludge management) and there is no reason whyIndian Tribes should not be similarly treated for purposes of administeringa non-NPDES program that regulated the same activities. Accordingly, EPA proposed to include in the definition of ``State'' inandSection; 501.2 an ``Indian Tribe which is eligible for treatment as aState under regulations promulgated under section 518 of the CWA.'' TheMarch 1988 proposal did not include a proposed rule addressing how IndianTribes would establish eligibility for treatment as States. Instead, itexpressed EPA's plans to address this issue in a separate rulemaking thatwould apply to various programs under the CWA, since the requirements werenot expected to differ significantly among the programs. The one State commenter on this issue argued that EPA does not have authorityto treat Indian Tribes as States for purposes of section 405(f) becausesection 518(e) of the CWA does not list section 405. For the reasons statedin the preambles to the proposed rule and today's rule, EPA disagrees.Therefore, the final definition of ``State'' in andSection; 501.3 is thesame as the proposed definition. As discussed in the preamble to the proposedrule, the regulations addressing how Indian Tribes may be treated as Statesfor purposes of the sludge program will be proposed separately as partof a regulation treating Indian Tribes as States under the NPDES program.Where an Indian Tribe does not have an approved State program, EPA expectsto be the permitting authority for facilities on Indian lands because Statesusually do not have authority to administer and enforce their environmentalprograms on these lands. In this situation, EPA will work with the tribalgovernment and other interested agencies in the development of an appropriaterole for the tribal government in administering the sludge program on Indianlands (consistent with the 1986 proposal and the practice under other federalenvironmental programs).I. Part 501: Non-NPDES State Programs. The following is a section-by-section analysis of Part 501, which establishesprogram requirements and procedures for States that use programs otherthan NPDES to administer an approved sludge management program (i.e., Stateswithout NPDES programs and States with approved NPDES programs which chooseto implement a sludge program separate from their NPDES program). <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Purpose, Scope, and General Program Requirements. </ITAG>Subpart A consists of three sections. Section 501.1 explains the purposeand scope of Part 501 and generally what requirements State programs musthave in order to be approved under section 405(f) of the CWA. In the finalrule this section has been slightly reorganized. The paragraph explainingassignment of program responsibilities, which appeared as paragraph (e)in the proposed rule, now appears as paragraph (1). The other two sectionsin Subpart A include andSection; 501.2 which defines key terms used in theregulations and andSection; 501.3 which discusses coordination with otherprograms. <T3>Authority </T3>(andSection; 501.1(a)). As discussed above, EPA's primaryauthority for promulgating State sludge management program regulationscomes from section 405(f) of the CWA, which was added by the 1987 amendments.EPA also has general authority to ``prescribe such regulations as are necessaryto carry out [the Administrator's] functions under this Act.'' CWA section501(a). section 101(e) also supports today's rulemaking (measures to promotepublic participation). Finally, section 518(e) authorizes the Administratorto promulgate regulations for purposes of treating Indian tribes as States(see discussion on this issue above). Since the authority provided in thesesections is broad enough to promulgate regulations to implement specificprovisions of the CWA, citation to other Clean Water Act sections havebeen dropped in the final rule. For this reason also, EPA disagrees withthe commenter who argued that EPA must list as authority all CWA provisionswhich might be implemented or assisted through approved State sludge managementprograms (e.g., section 405(d), section 307(b)). <T3>Scope. </T3>Section 501.1(c) of the final rule sets forth the generalrequirements for EPA to approve State sludge programs as adequate to implementCWA section 405. Consistent with Congressional intent, States that seekto administer a State sludge program in lieu of the federal program musthave authority generally as broad as EPA's to regulate sludge use and disposal.This would include the legal authority and programmatic capability to implementa permit program for the use and disposal of sewage sludge, to implementand enforce the Part 503 technical standards and any other federal sludgestandards (e.g., 40 CFR Part 257), and generally to take action to protectthe public health and environment from adverse effects of toxic pollutantsin sewage sludge. One commenter said that approved State programs mustbe equally as broad as EPA's programs, not ``generally'' as broad as statedin the preamble to the proposed rule. This suggestion is inappropriatebecause, as explained elsewhere, States may not have authority to regulatein certain instances, for example, on Indian lands or in the ocean. Therequired scope of State programs is also discussed above in section V.H.2.Section 501.1(c) establishes these basic requirements for approved Stateprograms. The final rule is substantially the same as the proposed rule.States must be able to assure compliance with the Federal sludge technicalstandards; issue permits to POTWs and other treatment works treating domesticsewage that apply and assure compliance with Federal standards and requirementsunder section 405 (including conditions developed on a case-by-case basisto protect public health and the environment when there are no applicabletechnical regulations); regulate use and disposal of sewage sludge by nonpermittees;take actions to abate violations of the State sludge programs (includingcivil and criminal penalties); and generally to take actions to protectpublic health and the environment from the adverse effects that may occurfrom toxic pollutants in sewage sludge. Although this paragraph has not changed substantially from the proposedrule, minor editorial changes have been made to clarify EPA's intent. First,paragraph (c)(1) was revised to state that States must have authority ``torequire compliance by any person who uses or disposes of sewage sludgewith standards for sludge use or disposal issued under section 405(d) ofthe CWA * * *'' (new language underlined). The first underlined changetracks statutory language and clarifies that compliance must be requiredof any person that handles sewage sludge, not just generators. As explainedin the discussion about users and disposers above in section V.D.3, Stateshave some flexibility in how they regulate users and disposers. The secondchange to this paragraph substitutes a term defined in andSection; 501.2for the previous language without changing the meaning. Second, paragraph (c)(2), which was phrased in terms of a prohibition againstthe use and disposal of sewage sludge not in compliance with a permit thatimplements federal requirements, now clearly states that States must haveauthority to issue permits that apply, and assure compliance with, Federalstandards. Again, this more closely tracks statutory language. As notedin the preamble to the proposed rule, this is the most important requirementfor an approvable State sludge program under Section 405 because the CWArequires State sludge programs to implement sludge standards through permitsissued to POTWs and other treatment works treating domestic sewage. Thepermit requirement in the 1988 proposal superseded two provisions in the1986 proposal relating to sludge management oversight: The requirementfor provisions for project-specific approvals and the requirement to describethe processes and procedures to be used for reviewing the planning, design,construction and operation of sludge management facilities. Section 501.1(d) describes the types of sludge use or disposal practicesthat States must be able to regulate. This paragraph is discussed in detailabove in section V.H.2. In addition, EPA received a comment saying thatthe proposal was confusing because it required States to be able to regulateocean dumping of sewage sludge under andSection; 501.1(d)(1)(B)(v), whilestating elsewhere in Part 501 that such regulation is precluded by theMarine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act. EPA agrees, and thereforehas dropped ocean disposal from the listing of practices that States mustbe able to regulate. As discussed in the preamble to the Feb. 4, 1986, proposal (51 FR 4461),MPRSA sections 106 (a) and (d) generally exclude States from regulatingor permitting ocean dumping. While the States are precluded from regulatingocean dumping by the MPRSA, States with POTWs that currently ocean dumpsewage sludge should continue to work with EPA and the dumpers in identifyingand implementing suitable land-based alternatives. State involvement inthe area of land-based alternatives is especially important in light ofthe MPRSA amendments prohibiting sewage sludge ocean dumping after December31, 1991, and those amendments recognize the need for active State involvementwith regard to land-based alternatives. <T3>See, </T3>H.Rep. 100-1090 at pg. 29. In particular, those MPRSA amendmentsspecifically provide that States are to participate in the negotiationsof plans to cease ocean dumping through the implementation of alternatives(MPRSA sections 104B(c) (2)(A) and (3)(A)), establish a State Clean OceansFund to provide financial assistance to dumpers in implementing alternativesto ocean dumping (MPRSA section 104B(c)(5)), and report on progress beingmade in implementing alternatives to ocean dumping (MPRSA section 104B(h)).While MPRSA sections 106 (a) and (d) preempt States from regulating oceandumping, EPA encourages States with POTWs that ocean dump sewage sludgeto participate in the development and implementation of land-based alternativesto ocean dumping in furtherance of the MPRSA's new requirements for thetermination of ocean dumping of sewage sludge. <T3>More stringent State or local laws. </T3>The 1986 proposed rule (inandSection; 501.15(d)) also acknowledged that section 510 of the CWA doesnot preclude States or their political subdivision from enacting laws governingsludge use or disposal that are more stringent than Federal law. However,to further encourage beneficial reuse of sludge, the 1986 proposal alsoprovided that ``State or local agencies should not ban or unreasonablyrestrict any sewage sludge management practice unless local circumstancesrequire such restrictions.'' The 1988 proposed rule (in andSection; 501.1(j)also codifies section 510 of the CWA and preserves the rights of Statesand local jurisdictions to adopt and enforce more stringent or more extensiverequirements than those required under Federal law. The 1988 proposal,however, did not retain the sentences addressing beneficial use and unreasonablelocal bans or restrictions on sludge management practices. Seven commenters, all State agencies, responded to the 1986 proposal, alladdressing the status of more stringent local laws. Three commenters saidthat EPA should not state in the regulations that local jurisdictions canenact stricter laws because such laws (1) are <T3>de facto </T3>bans; (2) conflict with State law; and (3) cause costlydelays and litigation. Similarly, two other commenters supported the sentencewhich advises local agencies against bans or unreasonable restrictionson sludge management practices. One of these commenters suggested furtherthat the regulations require that any local law be consistent with Federaland State requirements and not ban practices allowed by State or Federallaw. In a related vein, the only commenter on the 1988 proposal expressedconcern that more stringent State and local laws would unduly burden itssludge handling activities, which often crossed State lines. The commenterurged, therefore, that EPA, in effect, preempt this area of regulation.In contrast, two commenters opposed the admonition against unreasonablebans or restrictions because it was not an appropriate subject for Federalregulation and because State law would determine the ``reasonableness''of any local law. Today's final rule on the status of stricter State and local laws is thesame as the 1988 proposal (although now it is codified at andSection; 501.1(i)).Section 510 of the CWA clearly states that nothing in the CWA precludesmore stringent State and local laws. Similarly, section 405(d)(5) of theCWA states that: ``Nothing in this section is intended to waive more stringentrequirements established by this Act <T3>or any other law</T3>'' (emphasis added). Although section 510 of theCWA would apply in any event, restating it in the regulations serves importantnotice to the regulated community and other interested parties that section510 applies in the sludge use and disposal context as well. Commenterswho objected to this provision because they objected to the local laws(or State laws in the case of interstate sludge activities) themselveserroneously assume that EPA can through regulation prohibit stricter locallaws or preempt this area of regulation. This is clearly contrary to theCWA. For this reason also, EPA deleted the sentences addressing beneficialuse and unreasonable local bans or restrictions. EPA's policy of encouragingbeneficial use has not changed. Consistent with this policy, EPA's discouragesunreasonable restrictions on sludge use and disposal. However, EPA agreesthat admonitory provisions in the regulations are not the most appropriatemeans of implementing the goal of maximizing beneficial use. (It also apparentlymislead commenters into thinking that EPA had authority to dictate locallaw or preempt State and local law where no such authority exists.) Withrespect to concerns about interstate sludge activities, many States haveexpressed a general willingness to following EPA's lead on technical standardsfor sludge use and disposal. Therefore, EPA expects that differences amongState standards and requirements will decrease after promulgation of thePart 503 standards. EPA also expects that promulgation of Federal standardswill encourage public acceptance of beneficial use of sludge, which shouldfurther reduce the number of local restrictions thought necessary to protectpublic health.Paragraph (j) of this section states that nothing in Part 501 prohibitsa State from administering a more extensive program than what is requiredfor EPA approval. However, the additional coverage under the State programwould not be considered a part of the EPA-approved State program. The AttorneyGeneral's statement, described below, would identify the additional coverage.<T3>MPRSA preemption. </T3>Federal law does preempt State or local lawin one important area. This preemption is noted in andSection; 501.1(k),which states that sections 106 (a) and (d) of the Marine Protection, Research,and Sanctuaries Act generally preclude States from regulating or issuingpermits for ocean dumping. Approval of a State program under Part 501 doesnot change this preemption. <T3>Effect of EPA approval. </T3>EPA will approve State programs that meetthe requirements of Part 501 (andSection; 501.1(e)). Upon approval, EPA generallywill cease issuing those permits implementing sludge standards to permitteesthat will be within the jurisdiction of the approved State program andmake arrangements to turn over responsibility for EPA-issued permits tothe State. In some cases, such as a permit subject to a pending appealaction, EPA may retain jurisdiction. Section 501.1(f) addresses how thissituation is to be handled. This paragraph parallels andSection; 123.1(d)which addresses the same logistics of transferring responsibility for theNPDES permit program. Section 501.1(g) explains that approval of a State program does not affectEPA's authority to take enforcement actions for violations of section 405.This provision appeared in both the 1986 and 1988 proposals. One commenteron the 1986 proposal objected to this statement of federal enforcementauthority, claiming that State enforcement authority is adequate to controldomestic waste water sludge. Under the CWA, EPA has the authority to takeenforcement actions for violations of the CWA even where the State hassimilar authority. Section 501.1(g) notifies the State and the public ofits authority and intent to use this ``backup'' enforcement authority toensure compliance with the CWA where the State fails to take appropriateenforcement actions. EPA did not receive comments on either of these paragraphs(andSection; 501.1 (f) and (g)) in response to the 1988 proposal and thereforeis promulgating a final rule that is the same as the proposed rule. <T3>Assignment of program responsibilities. </T3>The March 1988 proposalcontained a provision specifically to allow States to assign program responsibilitiesto local agencies (other than field offices of the State agencies) undercertain circumstances. This provision was included in recognition thatlocal agencies, such as local health departments and soil conservationor agricultural extension offices, may play a significant role in carryingout various sludge management activities in some States. The purpose ofthe proposal was to allow decentralized administration of State sludgeprograms to continue and thus minimize disruption to existing State programs.EPA also reasoned that because proper sludge disposal may often dependon local conditions and disposal site characteristics, the knowledge andproximity of local agencies to regulated activities could enhance efficientand effective administration of program responsibilities. The proposed rule was carefully limited. It did not allow separate approvalof local programs (by the State or EPA) or relieve the approved State agencyof overall responsibility for program administration. It prohibited a Statefrom assigning program responsibilities to a local agency under controlof a political subdivision that also owns or operates a POTW or other facilitythat treats or disposes of sewage sludge, so as to avoid a conflict ofinterest inherent in a situation in which the local agency plays dual rolesof regulator and regulated party. Beyond these broad parameters, the proposedrule did not specify the extent to which a State agency could use localagencies to carry out program responsibilities. The proposed rule required that any assignment to local agencies be welldocumented and supported in the State's submission for program approval.States were also expected, through provisions in the MOA, to assume oversightresponsibilities to ensure that the assignment is carried out properly.In addition, to assure that EPA could effectively carry out its oversightresponsibilities in local delegation situations, the lead State agencywould remain responsible for all program reporting and other activitiesrelated to EPA oversight of the State's approved program (e.g., submissionof proposed permits for EPA review). Finally, State agencies would be requiredto retain all necessary authority to carry out program responsibilitiesso that they could step in where local agencies fail to carry out assignedfunctions adequately. EPA solicited comments on whether additional limitations should be establishedto guard against potential problems such as inconsistent application ofprogram requirements within the State. Also, because of concerns aboutpotential conflict of interest situations (i.e., where local agencies executingsludge responsibilities are part of the same political subdivision or othergovernmental entity with authority over POTWs or other sludge treatmentor disposal facilities), EPA solicited comments regarding the roles oflocal agencies in existing State sludge programs, including the variousfunctions they perform (e.g., permitting, compliance monitoring, enforcement),the extent to which they are the final decision-makers, and their relationshipsto State agencies, POTWs, and other sludge treatment and disposal facilities.EPA received nearly 15 comments on this section from the whole range ofcommenters. Approximately two-thirds of the commenters generally supportedthe proposal for reasons similar to those discussed in the preamble tothe proposed rule; a few supported with reservations; and only one commentersaid assignment to local agencies should not be allowed. Most States whichcommented on the proposal generally supported it. Responses from POTWswas more divided. The commenter most opposed to the proposal said that local delegation couldcomplicate permitting and administration for POTWs with facilities in differentlocal jurisdictions. The commenter suggested that if local delegation wereallowed, the State must be designated as the lead agency and the localagency assigned program functions must be larger than the POTW it regulates(specifically, a city, county, or township should not regulate a multi-countysanitary district). Now that EPA has clarified in the final rule that permitswill not be required for each ``facility'' at which the POTW's sludge isused or disposed, it is not clear how extensive the problem referred toby the commenter would be. In any event, nothing in proposed rule was intendedto dictate relations between the various political subdivisions of theState. That is best left to State law. No changes to final rule are neededto accomplish this. Commenters expressed several reservations about allowing local agenciesto carry out program responsibilities. One State agency said it shouldbe allowed if the State can assure quality control, e.g., minimum standards,program reviews, joint inspections. These are the types of State oversightactivities that should be addressed in the MOA under andSection; 501.15(1)(4).Two commenters addressed local agencies' capabilities for carrying regulatoryactivities. One commenter said local agencies may lack authority and expertiseto implement pretreatment standards that will be needed to meet the Part503 technical regulations. This comment confuses activities expected ofthe sludge management program with those already required by the pretreatmentprogram and therefore is unfounded. A POTW commented that stringent limitationsare needed because local agencies may not have the technical expertiseto regulate adequately. In this case, assignment of program responsibilitieswould be clearly inappropriate. The purpose of this provision is to allowlocal agencies which currently regulate sludge use and disposal and holdthe expertise in this area to continue this role under an approved Stateprogram. To clarify that any assignment must be to an agency that is competent,the final rule has been changed in two respects. First, the introductorysection has been rephrased to state that ``the Administrator may allowa State to assign portions of its program * * *'' (rather than ``A Statemay assign * * *''). This clarifies EPA's intent that whether assignmentto local agencies should be allowed is discretionary with EPA. To helpmake this determination, the final rule requires the State's program description,in addition to what was required in the proposed rule, to describe thecapabilities of the local agency to carry out assigned functions. On a more general level, one commenter stated that in all cases, the leadState agency must have final decision-making authority because delegationto local agencies or field offices often results in inadequate regulationand enforcement. Similarly, another commenter said that local delegationshould be prohibited unless the State agency can demonstrate legal authorityand resources to exercise direct control over local agencies involved insludge management, i.e., a ``genuine'' statewide program is needed to meetthe requirements and purposes of the Act. The final rule addresses theseconcerns by requiring the State agency to ``retain full authority and ultimateresponsibility for administering all aspects of the State's approved program* * *'' (andSection; 501.1(l)(6)) and to include in the MOA provisions foradequate State oversight of local agencies to which it has assigned programresponsibilities (andSection; 501.1(l)(4)).Only two commenters, both State agencies, specifically addressed the questionwhether additional restrictions were needed to ensure consistent applicationof State requirements. One said the proposed rule contained adequate restrictionsbecause States should determine the role of local agencies. The other commentersuggested that any additional requirements to ensure consistency couldbe incorporated into the MOA as needed. EPA agrees that this is a reasonableand flexible approach for ensuring program consistency. Several commenters addressed the potential conflict-of-interest problemsthat could occur when a State assigned program functions to a local agencythat was also a regulated party. Two conflict-of-interest provisions inthe proposed rule affect assignment to local agencies: (1) andSection; 501.1(e)(1),which prohibited assignment to a ``local agency under the jurisdictionof a political subdivision which owns or operates a POTW or other facilitythat treats or disposes of sewage sludge;'' and (2) andSection; 501.15(a)(7),which prohibits membership on any board or body that approves permits fromincluding any person who receives a significant portion of his or her incomefrom a permittee or applicant for a permit.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>This provision was specifically endorsed by one commenter,an industry.</ITAG>Three commenters, all addressing the sludge program in Washington State,said the proposal was too restrictive because it would effectively prohibitassignment of program responsibilities. The commenters considered thisresult inappropriate because local agencies responsible for protectingpublic health and the environment would not knowingly violate federal orState laws designed to protect public health and the environment and thatany perceived conflict of interest could be remedied by sending all permitsto the State agency for review, and if necessary, veto. Since nearly all political subdivisions own or operate a waste water treatmentworks, the conflict of interest provisions in the proposed rule effectivelyprohibit assignment of program responsibilities to local agencies, contraryto EPA's intent. Therefore, the final rule contains two changes to allowfor assignment to local agencies while still protecting against potentialconflicts of interest. First, andSection; 501.1(l)(1) (which appeared atandSection; 501.1(e)(1) in the proposal) has been amended to prohibit assignmentto any local agency which also owns or operates a POTW. This prohibitsdirect conflicts-of-interest, i.e., a POTW regulating itself. Unlike theproposed rule, however, it would allow assignment to a local agency whichdoes not own or operate a POTW but which is part of a political subdivisionwhich owns or operates a POTW. The second change affects the conflict-of-interest provision that appliesto any board or body that approves permits. Although addressed to Statepermitting bodies, it would apply to any local board or body that has beenassigned permit issuance responsibility. As proposed, it prohibits anyperson receiving a significant source of income from a permit holder orapplicant from being a member of the board or body that approves permits.This would effectively prohibit assignment to any local agency becausethe decision makers of local agencies in nearly all cases include at leastone person who is employed by or receives a significant source of incomefrom a permit holder or applicant (i.e., the municipality or other politicalsubdivision). Under the final rule, the Administrator may waive this stringent conflict-of-intereststandard if the board or body can certify that it meets a ``conflict-of-intereststandard imposed as part of another EPA-approved permitting program oran equivalent standard'' (andSection; 501.15(f)(ii)). The only conflict-of-intereststandard EPA is aware of that would provide such an alternative is theone found in section 128 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7428. That sectionrequires that a board or body that approves permits shall have ``at leasta majority of members who represent the public interest and do not deriveany significant portion of their income from persons subject to permits* * *'' and that ``any potential conflicts of interest by members of suchboard or body or the head of an executive agency with similar powers beadequately disclosed.'' As discussed more fully below, the Agency believesit is important to make this alternative standard available for non-NPDESState sludge programs. Today's final rule also makes this standard (orthe equivalent) available in the case of assignment of permit issuanceresponsibilities to local agencies. In all cases, however, the approvedState agency must be able to exercise direct control over permits issuedas part of the approved program. One commenter said that a POTW that receives sludges from other POTWs shouldregulate the incoming waste since it is the receiving POTW's dischargepermit which will be affected. EPA agrees. However, this situation is differentfrom that envisioned in the proposed rule. Generally, today's rule doesnot establish requirements for sludges discharged (through the sewer, hauledby truck, or transported through another conveyance) for treatment to POTWs.Like other incoming waste and influent, this is more the province of thepretreatment program. The sludge program will focus instead on the ultimatedisposal of sludge when it enters the environment. Nothing in today's finalrule concerning conflict of interest precludes a POTW or other permitteefrom regulating incoming wastes. Similarly, nothing in today's rule governing assignment of responsibilitiesto local agencies prohibits a POTW or other treatment works from controllingthe end use of its sludge when handled by another entity. In fact, as discussedin detail in section V.D.3 of this preamble concerning the regulation ofusers and disposers of sewage sludge, sludge generators may be requiredto control end use of their sludge by others in some situations. One commenter asked whether a local agency to which permitting responsibilitieshas been assigned would also be required to have the civil and criminalenforcement authorities required of State agencies under Part 501 if theState had these authorities. Today's final rule does not require that assignmentof program responsibilities be allowed only when the local agencies haveall authorities required of States. Therefore, a local agency that conductedpermitting activities for the responsible State agency need not also havethe enforcement authorities required by Part 501 (unless, of course, ithad also been assigned enforcement responsibilities). In all cases, theState must have authority to carry out all program requirements. Thus,a State would be expected to have the enforcement authorities requiredby Part 501 even if a local agency had similar authority (i.e., a Statecannot meet Part 501 requirements by showing that a local agency has therequired authority). <T3>Definitions. </T3>Section 501.2 defines key terms used in Part 501.Several of the proposed definitions, including ``sewage sludge,'' ``treatmentworks treating domestic sewage,'' and ``septage'' have undergone changesin the final rule and are discussed above in section V.D. This sectionaddresses changes to other definitions in Part 501. A key definition in Part 501 is ``Class I sludge management facility.''Under the regulations, ``Class I sludge management facilities'' (``ClassI facilities'') are expected to receive priority attention from approvedStates and are subject to more intensive EPA oversight. The February 1986proposal defined ``Class I facilities'' as any POTW required to developa pretreatment program under 40 CFR 403.8. EPA received only one majorobjection to this definition by a municipality which stated that continuedfocus on major POTWs diverted attention away from other serious sourcesof environmental problems such as agricultural and non-point sources. Thetwo other commenters representing States on this issue, however, favoredthe proposed definition because it focused the program on the largest sludgegenerators. The March 1988 proposal took a different approach by defining ``Class Isludge management facility'' to be any sludge facility classified as suchby the Regional Administrator in conjunction with the State Director, analogousto NPDES ``major facilities'' (see 40 CFR 122.2). The purpose of the 1988proposal was to allow priority facilities to be determined through a negotiatedprocess between the Region and the State administering an approved program.This would allow flexibility for targeting efforts on areas of specificconcern to the State (e.g., disposal on or near ecologically sensitiveareas such as estuaries) and on particular facilities with known or suspectedproblems with their sludge. The preamble further explained that EPA could,based on available information and national concerns, issue guidance onClass I determinations. Examples of potential Class I candidates includedsludge incinerators (because available information suggests that thesefacilities may have greater potential to threaten the environment) andmajor POTWs required to have pretreatment programs under 40 CFR 403.8 (becausefacilities are so classified on the basis of their size and industrialcontribution). EPA specifically invited comment on the process for identifyingClass I facilities contained in the proposed definition of ``Class I sludgemanagement facility.''EPA received 19 comments on the 1988 proposed definition of ``Class I sludgemanagement facility.'' Two States and one individual supported the proposeddefinition because of the flexibility it offered. One supporter noted thatnational guidance for designating Class I facilities still would be needed.Most commenters opposed the proposed definition because it was too flexible.Minimally, these commenters wanted the definition to include acceptablecriteria for designating Class I facilities. Reasons for wanting more specificity in the definition included promotingconsistency among State programs, discouraging automatic designation oflarge municipalities as Class I facilities, and ensuring more objectivity.Commenters also suggested a wide range of criteria for inclusion in thedefinition, based on specific types of facilities (e.g., disposal-onlyfacilities, pretreatment POTWs, and NPDES majors), specific use or disposalpractices (e.g., incineration, ocean dumping), general characteristics(e.g., amount of sludge produced, design flow), and general effect (e.g.,potential for a significant impact on the environment). Today's final definition of ``Class I sludge management facility'' borrowsfrom both proposals and the comments asking for more specificity. It isdefined as ``any POTW identified under 40 CFR 403.8(a) as being requiredto have an approved pretreatment program (including such POTWs locatedin a State that has elected to assume local program responsibilities pursuantto 40 CFR 403.10(e)) and any other treatment works treating domestic sewageclassified as such by Regional Administrator in conjunction with the StateDirector because of the potential for its sludge use or disposal practicesto adversely affect public health or the environment.'' Most significantly,the definition now directly and indirectly articulates the overriding goalof section 405 to protect public health and the environment from unsafesewage sludge use and disposal. Under the final definition, any POTW required to develop a pretreatmentprogram under andSection; 403.8 will be considered a ``Class I facility.''This means not only POTWs that currently have approved pretreatment programs,but also any POTW falling within the definition of andSection; 403.8(a),including those POTWs located in States that have chosen to exercise theoption to assume local responsibilities under andSection; 403.10(e). At aminimum, the definition of ``Class I Facility'' includes these POTWs. PretreatmentPOTWs will be considered ``Class I sludge management facilities'' regardlessof their status under the NPDES program as ``major'' or ``minor'' facilities.As one commenter noted, the possible reasons for requiring a POTW to developa pretreatment program_size, complexity, industrial influent, and recurringproblems with sludge contamination_also support treating these POTWs aspriorities under the sludge program. Currently, 1,485 POTWs are requiredto have local pretreatment programs. They account for approximately 78percent of all sludge generated by POTWs and 87 percent of industrial flowto POTWs. Although only a few commenters responding to the 1988 proposalspecifically endorsed designating andSection; 403.8(a) POTWs as Class I facilities,many of the other categories or criteria suggested by commenters for designatingClass I facilities are included within the pretreatment classification,e.g., size, sludge production, use of ocean dumping or incineration, andpotential to adversely affect public health and the environment. Treatment works other than pretreatment POTWs also can be designated asClass I sludge management facilities under the final definition. As inthe 1988 proposal, the designation would be made by the Regional Administratorin conjunction with the State Program Director. Designation of Class Ifacilities, however, would still be subject to negotiation between theRegional Administrator and State Program Director. Thus, the definitionis intended to preserve flexibility to accord priority status to facilitieswhich are of particular concern to States or which may pose significantrisks. The final definition states that this discretionary category isto be based on the potential to adversely affect public health and theenvironment. This criteria was added in response to requests for more specificityand is not intended to minimize flexibility. Shortly after promulgation of today's rule, EPA will initiate a processfor identifying ``Class I Sludge Management Facilities,'' similar to theone used to classify NPDES major facilities. As part of this process, EPAwill be working with the States and the regulated community to best definethose facilities that should be accorded priority status. The identificationof andSection; 403.8(a) POTWs in today's rule is a bare minimum and servesto ensure that at least these facilities are covered until the final criteriaare established. A State or Region may of course, designate an individualfacility as a ``Class I'' at any time, based on that facility's potentialto adversely affect public health and the environment. One commenter suggested that all NPDES ``major'' facilities be designatedas Class I sludge management facilities. EPA disagrees.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Contrary to one commenter's interpretation, the proposedrule did not say that all NPDES ``majors'' would be considered ``ClassI sludge management facilities.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">``Majors'' are targeted for priority treatment under the NPDES program,usually based on the potential for their discharges to adversely affectreceiving water quality. The criteria for determining which facilitiesshould be majors do not necessarily correlate with the criteria for determiningwhich treatment works should be given priority treatment under the sludgeprogram. Therefore, there is no basis for automatically assuming that NPDES``majors'' should also be ``Class I facilities'' for purposes of sludgeregulation. Two commenters objected to providing for Regional and State negotiationin designating Class I facilities. One State said that EPA involvementwas unnecessary and did not add to the overall program, particularly giventhe goal of having State and local governments responsible for sludge management.Conversely, an industry commenter said that EPA headquarters should havesole responsibility for designating Class I facilities to avoid inconsistency,unpredictability, and confusion; States could address specific problemsof local interest in other ways such as more stringent State laws undersection 510 of the CWA. EPA continues to believe that both States and EPAshould play a role in defining program priorities. The proposed rule included definitions for the terms ``distributor,'' ``generator,''``use'' or ``utilization practice,'' and ``users'' which were expectedto be in forthcoming technical regulations (40 CFR Part 503). Those definitionsare no longer being used as general definitions in the technical regulationsand serve no useful purpose in Part 501. Accordingly, they have been deletedin the final rule. The proposed rule also included a definition of ``facility'' that has beendeleted in the final rule. As explained above in the discussion of revisionsto Part 122, the use of the broadly defined word ``facility'' created confusionparticularly with regard to requirements which EPA intended to apply onlyto entities required to obtain permits under section 405(f), and not necessarilyto all ``facilities.'' Therefore, it has been deleted. In several instancesthroughout the regulations, ``facility'' has been replaced with ``treatmentworks treating domestic sewage'' to further clarify when a particular requirementapplies to entities required to obtain permits under section 405(f) (e.g.,andSection; 501.14(c)(2); andSection; 501.15(a)(2)(ii)). The final rule includes several definitions that were not in the proposedrule. In all cases, these definitions were defined elsewhere and are beingadded to Part 501 because they are frequently used in the regulations.These definitions are: ``CWA;'' ``POTW;'' ``Publicly owned treatment works;''and ``Standards for sludge use or disposal.'' Finally, the definition of ``approved program'' has been changed to ``approvedState program'' in response to a comment that use of ``approved program''and ``approved State'' in the regulations was confusing. For purposes ofPart 501, ``approved State program'' means a State program approved byEPA pursuant to Part 501. Conforming changes have been made throughoutthe final rule by inserting ``approved State program'' anywhere ``approvedprogram'' or ``approved State'' previously appeared. <T3>Coordination with other programs. </T3>The 1988 proposed rule includeda provision authorizing coordination of permit issuance under the approvedState program with permit issuance under other Federal or State environmentalpermit programs that may affect the same facilities or regulate activitiesrelated to sludge management. This provision remains unchanged in the finalrule. Since sludge use and disposal occur in different environmental media,coordination with other programs may be very important to promote consistencyand efficiency. Coordination with the issuance of NPDES discharge permits(whether issued by EPA or another State agency) may be particularly appropriatesince a facility's sludge operation is closely linked to its wastewatertreatment processes and, in the case of POTWs, its pretreatment program.Similarly, ground water impacts are an important consideration for severalsludge use and disposal practices (e.g., monofills, land application).In these cases, consulting with the agencies or offices responsible forimplementing such programs as wellhead protection and sole-source aquiferprograms can be useful.Today's final rule on coordination among sludge-related programs differsfrom the coordination provision in the 1986 proposed Part 501. The earlierproposal would have required a State to have provisions for coordinationamong a wide range of State and local programs including regulatory, technical,and financial assistance, and public education programs that may affectsewage sludge use and disposal. (<T3>See </T3>proposed andSection; 501.15(a)(9) at 51 FR 4466, February 4,1986.) EPA dropped this detailed requirement in the 1988 proposal so asto maximize State flexibility in program areas not directly related toassuring compliance with federal technical sludge standards. (However,the State must still explain in the program description coordination amongprograms and offices where State program responsibility is divided amongvarious programs.) Nonetheless, EPA agrees with one commenter on the 1986proposal that coordination is important to POTWs whose various sludge activitiesare regulated under different programs. Coordination can also enhance theeffectiveness of the various State programs. A majority of commenters on the 1986 proposal raised questions about therelationship between the sludge and pretreatment programs that are stillrelevant under today's final rule. One commenter argued that the regulationsmust require integration of the sludge, NPDES, and pretreatment programs.As discussed elsewhere, EPA interprets the CWA as providing more flexibilityfor State programs than this approach would allow, even though integrationof these programs would be a sensible organization. Under today's finalrule, States must determine how best to organize their agencies to meetrequirements for program approval. The same commenter who argued for mandatory integration with the pretreatmentprogram also argued that the regulations should (1) indicate when and howlocal pretreatment limits must be revised when the POTW is unable to complywith new sludge technical standards; and (2) commit the Agency to reevaluatingcategorical pretreatment standards to take into account promulgation ofnew technical standards under section 405(d) of the CWA. Other commentersrequested clarification about the relationship between the two programs,including how different program goals and objectives are affected; howprocedures are implemented, including reporting to EPA and enforcementmechanisms; how NPDES and non-NPDES States should implement the two programs;and how the sludge technical standards should be used in local pretreatmentprograms to allocate wasteloads among industrial users (IUs). The followingdiscussion briefly addresses each of these issues. A major determinant of sludge quality is the composition of wastewaterentering the treatment works. The pretreatment program under sections 307and 402(b)(8) of the CWA is intended to control pollutant discharges toPOTWs. It imposes pollution controls (known as the national categoricalpretreatment standards and prohibited discharge standards) on industrialand commercial facilities which discharge to POTWs (IUs), and requirescertain POTWs (e.g., those with a design flow greater than 5 mgd or smallPOTWs with a significant industrial flow) to establish local pretreatmentprograms to regulate IUs. These local programs include the developmentof local discharge limits for IUs. Reducing pollutant loadings to a POTWthrough pretreatment typically reduces pollutant loadings to the POTW'ssludge. A POTW's pretreatment requirements are included in its NPDES permit, andare enforceable to the same extent as other permit conditions. Among thegoals of the pretreatment program is the prevention of interference. Thedefinition of ``interference'' includes a POTW's inability to comply withregulations governing its chosen sludge use or disposal methods due tocontamination caused by industrial user discharges to the POTW. (40 CFR403.3(i)(2)). When national categorical pretreatment standards do not reducepollutant loadings to a POTW sufficiently to prevent pass through and interference,the POTW must develop and enforce ``local limits'' applicable to its IUsor take other measures to prevent pass through and interference. In addition,IUs are prohibited from discharging pollutants to POTWs that would causeinterference. Thus, there is both a practical and regulatory connectionbetween the pretreatment and sludge programs. Despite the direct links with the sludge technical standards, the pretreatmentprogram is a separate regulatory program. The Agency believes that establishingnew requirements for the pretreatment program in today's rule, particularlya requirement to reevaluate national categorical pretreatment standardsin light of new sludge standards, is unnecessary. First, the Clean WaterAct, including the 1987 amendments, already provides for regular reevaluationof the categorical standards and effluent guidelines (sections 307(b) and304(m)). In response to section 304(m), the Agency recently proposed plansfor reviewing and revising existing effluent guidelines and categoricalpretreatment standards and promulgating new guidelines and standards fordischarges of toxic and nonconventional pollutants. Examining possibleeffects on sludge quality will be a part of this effort. <T3>See </T3>53 FR 32584, August 25, 1988. Second, under the pretreatmentprogram, local limits may play a more important role than national categoricalstandards in achieving compliance with sludge technical standards becausesludge quality requirements may vary depending on site-specific factors.Local limits are more efficient in dealing with such site-specific situations.In addition, sludge quality is only one of several factors that must beconsidered for local limit requirements and, in some cases, for compliancewith sludge technical standards. Thus, promulgation of new sludge technicalstandards will not necessarily lead to revised local limits, although thepromulgated technical sludge standards likely will lead to at least a reevaluationof existing local limits. Local limits may already be more stringent thannecessary to comply with sludge standards, because they are based on stringenteffluent discharge limits or other requirements. Also, a POTW may be ableto comply with sludge standards by modifying its sludge management practices(e.g., by decreasing the amount of sludge applied to a given parcel ofland), rather than through ``cleaner'' sludge. Moreover, a POTW may decideto switch to another sludge use or disposal method, rather than improvingthe quality of its sludge through revised local limits. Congress clearlyprovided for this option in section 405(e) of the CWA. The feasibilityof each option can be determined through a local limit analysis. Guidancefor conducting this analysis and for allocating the ``waste load'' amongIUs is contained in the ``Guidance Manual for the Development and Implementationof Local Discharge Limitations under the Pretreatment Program,'' EPA Officeof Water Enforcement and Permits, December 1987. The regulations for the pretreatment program at 40 CFR Part 403 alreadyaddress how POTWs must adjust their pretreatment programs in response tochanges such as promulgation of sludge technical standards. (<T3>See. </T3>e.g., andSection; 403.5(c) (development of local limits) andandSection; 403.18 (modification of POTW pretreatment program) (53 FR 40562,October 17, 1988)). (<T3>See </T3><T3>also</T3> proposed revisions to andSection; 403.5(c) which clarify POTWs'continuing responsibility to develop and enforce local limits. 53 FR 47652,November 23, 1988). The requirements for sludge use and disposal applicable to a particularPOTW (e.g., interim sludge conditions in permits and, when promulgated,the sludge technical standards) serve as one of the environmental criteriawhich ``drive'' the POTW's pretreatment program requirements. Therefore,the approval authority for the POTW's pretreatment program (either EPAor NPDES States with approved pretreatment programs) needs to know whatthose sludge requirements are. Although this does not require that thesame regulatory authority administer both programs, it does require coordinationamong the programs.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Development and Submission of State Programs </ITAG>Section 501.11 summarizes the basic components of a program submission,each of which is described in greater detail in subsequent sections. Theessential components of a program submission are: a letter from the Governorrequesting program approval, a description of the State's sludge managementprogram, a statement of the State's legal authority to implement the programfrom the Attorney General, and a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) betweenthe Regional Administrator and the State Program Director. In addition,this section requires States to submit copies of ``all applicable statutesand regulations, including those governing State administrative procedures.andSection; 501.11(a)(5). The 1986 proposal included similar requirements.In response to the 1986 proposal, two States objected to the requirementthat the program submission include copies of the statutes and regulationsgoverning the State's program. The commenters said this requirement wasunnecessary or redundant. EPA disagrees. Copies of statutes and regulationsare needed, in conjunction with the Attorney General's Statement, to determinewhether the State has adequate legal authority to carry out an approvedprogram. Requiring a State to submit these documents with its program submissionhelps to ensure that EPA has complete and up-to-date authorities when reviewingthe State's submission. Therefore, the final rule is the same as the proposed.EPA did not receive any other major comments affecting this section aspresented in the March 1988 proposal. Instead, commenters addressed theirconcerns in comments on the separate sections establishing the requirementsfor each program submission component. Therefore, the final rule will besubstantially the same as the proposed rule. The only change in the finalrule for this section is a format change. All requirements related to approvalprocedures (most of paragraphs (b) through (d)) have been moved to andSection;501.31, which specifically addresses procedures for review and approvalof State programs. Material which was redundant has been deleted. A State's application for program approval is not considered ``submitted''until EPA determines that the submission is complete. Under andSection; 501.11(b)EPA will notify the State whether its submission is complete within 30days after EPA receives the State's submission. If the submission is incomplete,EPA will identify the information needed to complete the submission. Acomplete submission triggers the review and approval procedures describedin andSection; 501.31. EPA received one comment in response to the 1988 proposal related to arequirement for the State to submit a ``responsiveness summary'' with itsprogram submission, and to undertake other public participation activitiesbefore submitting its program to EPA for review. These requirements werein the 1986 proposal but were dropped in the 1988 proposal. The commenterobjected to deleting these requirements. A responsiveness summary describespublic participation activities related to the State's application forprogram approval, public comments received on the State's program and aresponse to those comments. The responsiveness summary was to have beenprepared by the State after it made its program submission available forpublic comment and conducted other public participation activities. EPAdropped the responsiveness summary and related requirements imposed onthe States in the 1988 proposal but still provided for all necessary publicparticipation activities through approval procedures to be undertaken byEPA Regional offices (see andSection; 501.31 described later in section V.1.11).The effect of this change is to eliminate redundant requirements (as requestedby several commenters on the 1986 proposal), not to reduce the public'sopportunity to participate in EPA's decision on State program approval.It is also important to note that public participation procedures undertakenby EPA as part of the State program approval process are not substitutesfor procedures States may be required by State law to follow in adoptingregulations or other program requirements. Therefore, EPA expects thatinterested persons will have had at least one previous opportunity to commenton State regulations. (They also will have a separate opportunity to commenton federal regulations from which State regulations may be derived.) Thefocus of public comment on the State's program submission then is whetherthe State's program meets EPA requirement for approvable programs. Forthis purpose, the minimum 45 day comment period provided in andSection; 501.31(c)(1)should be adequate. Although a longer comment period may be provided atthe discretion of the Regional Administrator, EPA does not agree with acommenter on the 1986 proposal that a 60 or 90 day comment period is neededto allow regulated parties time to review and comment on the technicalregulations that apply to the various use or disposal methods which maybe used by a treatment works. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Program Description. (Section 501.12) </ITAG>This section provides a detailed discussion of the nature and contentsof the program description. The program description explains how the Stateintends to administer its sludge program. While the legal authorities definethe scope of the State's intended implementation, the program descriptionis a narrative description of scope, structure, coverage and processesof the State's program. The program description should explain how theprogram is adequate to meet the essential requirements of CWA Section 405:to implement the technical standards through permits and to protect publichea1th and the environment from adverse effects from pollutants in sewagesludge. When first proposed in February 1986, the requirements for the programdescriptions elicited general comments from several States that the requirementswere too detailed. However, EPA must have a very clear understanding ofhow a State's program works to evaluate it for approval, and after approval,to work with the State on an on-going basis. The program description isalso the primary document for explaining the State's program to the publicand regulated community, which helps to ensure that they have a meaningfulopportunity to comment on the State's application for approval. Therefore,detailed information is needed and serves a critical purpose. At the sametime, EPA has carefully evaluated the need for specific information, andin several cases described below, has reduced or eliminated informationrequirements. An important feature of the program description is designation of a leadagency when more than one State agency will be responsible for administeringthe approved program. The lead agency requirement was in both the 1986proposal (andSection; 501.12(a)) and the 1988 proposal (andSection; 501.12(b)).A majority of commenters on this issue supported the lead agency requirementas necessary to assure consistency, provide common direction to regulatedparties, and to simplify the working relationship between EPA and the approvedState program. EPA agrees that having a lead agency serves an importantpurpose and therefore has retained in the final rule the requirement thatthe program description designate a lead agency when more than one Stateagency will be responsible for administering an approved program. The finalrule differs from the l988 proposed rule in that it no longer requireseach involved State agency to have statewide jurisdiction over a classof activities. This is intended to provide more flexibility to States.In response to the 1986 proposal, three commenters objected to the leadagency requirement. One commenter said the designation should be optionalwith the State. The other two commenters objected because they read thelead agency provision to require reorganization of State agencies or evenstatutory amendments to consolidate all program activity under one agency.This reflects a misunderstanding about the lead agency requirement. Itdoes not require agency reorganization, but instead requires that one ofthe agencies responsible for program administration serve as the lead contactfor working with EPA on issues relating to the approved State program.Thus, the lead agency would be responsible for coordinating program approval(e.g., submit documents to EPA, serve as a contact for inquiries from thepublic, negotiate necessary changes) and serving as the State contact forEPA oversight activities (e.g., permit reviews, semi-annual noncompliancereporting, and annual program reports). Fulfilling this coordination rolemay require additional work on the part of the lead agency, but it providesan alternative to reorganizing State agencies to achieve the same purpose.Designating only one agency to act as liaison with EPA is also an efficientuse of resources for both EPA and the State. Section 501.12(b) requires the description to include an explanation ofthe organization and structure of the agency or agencies that will administerthe program, including the number and general responsibilities of the employees.This must be accompanied by an organizational chart for all agencies whichwill be responsible for administering the program. One State commentedthat submitting the organization chart was unnecessary. This requirementis included because EPA needs to know how the State agency is structured.Organization charts display often complex relationships in an easy-to-understandform and therefore are very useful in describing the agency's structure.Most agencies have organization charts readily available; submitting themwith the program description should not be unduly burdensome. Therefore,the final rule retains the requirement to submit an organization chartfor each involved agency.The 1988 proposal required States, as part of the program description,to submit a discussion on estimated costs and available resources necessaryto implement the program. These requirements were more extensive than whatwas proposed on February 4, 1986, because additional information was deemednecessary to evaluate whether State resources are adequate to implementthe program. In the 1988 proposal, EPA specifically solicited commentson whether cost and resource factors are appropriate measures to considerin determining whether to approve the State's program. Two commenters on the 1986 proposal stated that the cost and resource requirementswere too cumbersome and detailed, and therefore should be deleted, whileone State supported the requirement. In contrast, all but one of the commenterson the 1988 proposal said that cost and resources are appropriate measuresto gauge the adequacy of State programs. In fact one commenter said thatmore detailed information on program funding is needed to evaluate theadequacy of the State program. EPA agrees and in the final rule requiresgreater detail on the costs and resources of the State program in the programdescription. In the final rule, andSection; 501.12(b)(2) has been revised to specify aninitial two year time period for which the State must provide the estimatedcosts of establishing and administering the program after approval. Theproposed rule did not specify what period of time the information mustcover. Requiring information for the first two years of a program shouldestablish what resources are necessary to begin and implement a program.One commenter suggested that these requirements be annual. EPA's intentis to ensure a State can establish and support a program for purposes ofapproving the program. Annual reporting is more appropriately addressedthrough program oversight and grant negotiations. Proposed andSection; 501.12(b)(3) required an estimate of resources availablefor program implementation. Under the final rule, States must submit anestimate of the sources, as well as the amounts of funding needed for thefirst two years after program approval. This estimate will allow EPA toconsider start-up activities as well as initial implementation activitiesin determining whether a program is viable. A comparison of the resourcesneeded for program establishment and implementation against the sourcesand amounts of available funding will help make this assessment. Another comment addressed the difficulty of estimating costs until thetechnical regulations are published. EPA understands that in the absenceof technical standards, program planning cannot be precise. EPA proposedthe technical standards (40 CFR Part 503) on February 6, 1989 (54 FR 5746).Therefore, States will have the proposed Part 503 rules as a source ofinformation upon which to base estimates of resources needed to administeran approved program. Moreover, today's final rule requires a general estimateof costs and resources needed to develop and administer State programs.EPA seeks information that is sufficient to evaluate the State's abilityto implement a program. The program description must include a description of applicable Statepermitting, administrative, and judicial review procedures. This includesa description of any administrative review or appeal procedures and criteria,as well as procedures and criteria for any variances available under Statelaw, to allow EPA to review these for consistency with the requirementof section 405 to comply with the sludge technical standards. The programdescription must also contain copies of application and reporting forms.EPA disagrees with a State which commented that submitting forms is unnecessary.The requirement to submit forms is particularly critical for the sludgemanagement program since EPA has not yet developed uniform national forms.Therefore, EPA will need to review State forms to see if they require theinformation required by this Part. A major part of the program description is the facility inventory (andSection;501.12(f)). The March 1988 proposal required the State to submit a completelist of all POTWs or other treatment works treating domestic sewage, i.e.,all facilities required to obtain sludge permits, as a precondition toprogram approval. (The March 1988 proposal was considerably pared downfrom the February 4, 1986 proposal, which would have required an inventoryof all sewage sludge generators and sewage sludge disposal facilities inthe State, including firms which pump and service septic tanks and portabletoilets, and an inventory of known violations.) Under the March 1988 proposal,the States would still be expected eventually to complete an inventoryof all generators and disposal facilities and sites and were required toexplain in the program description how and when the inventory would becompleted and the State's plan for maintaining the inventory. However,only a partial inventory of generators was required as a precondition toprogram approval. The inventory requirement in both proposals generated numerous comments.Most commenters on the 1986 proposal focused on the requirement to inventoryfirms which pump and service septic tanks and portable toilets. Nearlyall opposed that requirement as unnecessary (as, for example, where Statelaw requires septage to be discharged to POTWs) or too burdensome. SeveralStates commented generally that overall the inventory requirement was tooburdensome and would take too much time and expense to compile. One Staterecommended requiring only a list of the sludge generators and sludge managementfacilities. Another commenter suggested that the inventory be phased-in,beginning with Class I generators. All the commenters on the 1986 proposal to provide an inventory of knownviolation of sludge requirements were opposed to such an inventory. Theyquestioned the need for the information for EPA review of a State program.One commenter stated that such an inventory would be difficult to compileuntil there was an operational State program. The requirement to submitan inventory of known violations was dropped in the 1988 proposal. Also,based in part on comments, EPA dropped the requirement for the inventoryto include all firms that pump and service septic tanks and portable toiletsin the 1988 proposed rule. This requirement also is not a part of today'sfinal rule. The inventory requirement in the final rule is basically the same as thatin the March 1988 proposal in that it retains the phased-in option. Therule has been expanded to specify: (1) Which facilities must be includedin the initial inventory and which can be included later; (2) what typeof information about each facility must be included in the initial inventoryand what information can be submitted later; and (3) a deadline for completingany partial inventories. The purpose of requiring an inventory as part of the State's program submissionis to ensure that the State has identified which facilities will need permitsbefore taking on the task of issuing permits. Later, the inventory alsowill serve as a planning tool and compliance monitoring and tracking systemand thus needs to provide a comprehensive picture of sludge use and disposalin the State. Ultimately, the inventory will include all POTWs, non-industrialtreatment works treating domestic sewage, industrial treatment works treatingdomestic sewage, and all sewage sludge disposal and use sites not includedas a treatment works. However, the initial inventory need only includeall facilities that are or will be required to obtain a permit upon promulgationof 40 CFR Part 503, i.e., all POTWs and non-industrial treatment workstreating domestic sewage. These are the facilities that come under thefirst round of permitting either because they are POTWs (and hence aresubject to section 405(d)(4) of the CWA), or because they are privately-ownedtreatment works covered by the first round of the Part 503 technical regulations(including 40 CFR Part 258). States would have to expand their inventorieslater to include industrial treatment works treating domestic sewage anduse and disposal sites not included under another category, before finalpromulgation of Part 503 standards applicable to these facilities. OneState commented that since ``treatment works'' included land for storage,treatment and disposal of sludge, no apparent difference existed betweenthe initial and later inventories. As explained above, each component ofa treatment works is not considered a separate treatment works. Therefore,there is a difference between treatment works and off-site use or disposalsites. In addition, beneficial use sites such as farms, home gardens, etc.,do not fall within the definition of ``treatment works treating domesticsewage'' in today's rule. The reference in the definition to land usedfor storage, treatment or disposal refers to monofills, surface disposalsites, etc. (See discussion of definition of ``treatment works'' in sectionV.D.2 above). Therefore, an inventory of the beneficial use sites is notrequired with the program submission.In the 1988 proposed rules, the information about each facility requiredin the inventory was listed in the andSection; 501.21 provision requiringa State to update the inventory as part of an annual report. The relationshipbetween the two inventory requirements was not clear from the face of theregulation and therefore created considerable confusion. For example, onecommenter said the inventory requirement was too vague and needed to specifywhat information was expected. Another said the inventory was unnecessarybecause the information was already required in the annual report. To remedythis problem, andSection; 501.12(f)(1) now also specifies required inventoryinformation, including: (1) Name, location, and ownership status; (2) sludgeuse or disposal practice(s); (3) annual sludge production volume; (4) otherenvironmental permit numbers; and (5) compliance status. This list doesnot include influent characteristics, as suggested by a commenter. Influentcharacteristics can help predict sludge characteristics and therefore maybe useful information, particularly for identifying potential sludge (andother environmental) problems. For this reason, POTWs with pretreatmentprograms are required to review and evaluate influent characteristics ona regular basis. However, this type of detailed information is not suitablefor the inventory of sludge facilities, which is designed to provide generaldata about the regulated community, not as the basis for developing site-specificrequirements. In addition, andSection; 501.12(f)(2) requires that the inventory includeall sewage sludge disposal and use sites not included as part of the inventoryof treatment works. Information about each site would include name, location,permit number (if any), and source of sewage sludge. Keeping track of thesource of the sludge is important so that, if necessary, POTWs recordsof metals loadings to a particular site can be traced. Today's final ruleclarifies that site information is <T3>not</T3> required for the end use of sludge that meets distributionand marketing requirements (e.g., home gardens). The initial inventory submitted with the program application must includefor each facility the information in the first two categories (i.e., andSection;501.12(f)(1) (i) and (ii)). The remaining information can more easily begathered through program implementation activities and therefore wouldbe submitted as part of the annual report. These phased-in informationrequirements basically follow the suggestion of a State commenter to the1986 proposal.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>For similar reasons, the March 1988 proposal dropped a requirementfrom the 1986 proposal that would have required States to submit an inventoryof ``known violations.''</ITAG>One commenter said that the regulation should specify a deadline for completingthe inventory. EPA agrees. Therefore, the final rule requires a State thatsubmits only a partial inventory with its application for program approvalto also submit a detailed plan showing how the State will complete theinventory of treatment works within five years after approval of the State'sprogram. EPA did not adopt the commenter's suggested deadline of ``oneyear after applications are due under section 405(d)(2)(D).'' First, theCWA does not specify an application deadline. Second, today's final ruleensures completion of the inventory in a reasonably timely manner by requiringannual inventory updates (andSection; 501.21) and completion of the inventoryby the end of a full permit cycle. EPA also received several other comments on the inventory requirement.One commenter said that in addition to requiring an inventory, EPA shouldrequire States to use it to devise a rational overall plan for sludge useand disposal. The purpose of the inventory requirement, together with otherrequirements in Part 501, is to make sure that a State program has certainelements which are necessary to assure compliance with Part 405. Beyondthis, it would not be appropriate to direct States in the regulations howto use the required information. Some States said that, however desirable, the inventory would require considerableresources and that additional funding would be needed to compile them.These comments were submitted mostly in response to the l986 proposal.EPA recognizes that compiling a comprehensive inventory is a major undertaking,but it will be essential for administering the regulatory program envisionedin section 405. For the past few years, EPA has encouraged States, oftenthrough Section 106 grants funds, to compile inventories. In fact, severalStates responding to the March 1988 proposal reported significant progressin compiling inventories. Finally, one commenter suggested that EPA develop a uniform reporting formatfor inventories to prevent redundant State efforts and to provide a uniformdata base. In response to similar requests from States in comments on theFebruary 1986 proposal, EPA is developing a computer software package forthis purpose called the Sludge Inventory Database (SID). SID is designedto provide assistance to States and other potential users in compilingdetailed inventory information on: (1) The identities and locations ofPOTWs and other treatment works treating domestic sewage; (2) the sludgetreatment processes used by these facilities (including production datafor each treatment process); and (3) the sampling and analysis data whichreflect the chemical constituent of the sewage sludge. EPA is also workingon a system to integrate SID data into various EPA mainframe data basesto facilitate the development of a national inventory of sewage sludgegenerators, processors, and disposers. Another requirement for the program description contained in the March1988 proposal was an identification of any separate State programs forregulating septage disposal. The February 1986 proposal would have requireda more extensive description of the State's septage disposal program. EPAopted for less extensive requirements in the 1988 proposal because howa State regulates septage would be significant for the purposes of itssection 405(f) sludge program only in that its program must ensure thatthe use and disposal of septage is adequately regulated as contemplatedby the proposed technical standards. For this reason, EPA would need knowwhether there was a separate State program for septage use and disposal.Several commenters said this requirement was unnecessary if EPA would notbe regulating all septage disposal. As long as septage is considered sewagesludge for purposes of Part 503 (and hence, of Part 501), it will be importantfor States to inform EPA about which State agency regulates septage thatis applied to land or disposed of by one of the other practices regulatedunder Part 503. However, EPA agrees that the requirement in the proposedrule to identify separate septage programs is redundant and therefore hasdeleted it in the final rule. Under andSection; 501.12(b), the program descriptionmust describe each State agency that will be responsible for administeringthe approved program and delineate the responsibilities of each agency.Therefore, the program description already requires the State to identifyany separate septage use and disposal program (to the extent that programregulates use or disposal that comes under Part 503 regulations). Under both the 1986 and 1988 proposals, States were asked to submit separatedocumentation of any State or local bans or prohibitions against particularsludge use or disposal practices. No commenters explicitly supported thisrequirement. Two commenters said it was redundant with regard to stricterState laws because another provision already required submission of allState statutes applicable to the State's sludge management program. OtherState commenters objected to the requirement as unduly burdensome (apparentlybecause local bans or prohibitions can be widespread), particularly if,as one commenter feared, it entailed documentation of all local zoningdecisions. Finally, one State said such documentation was useless becausein its State many local bans or prohibitions were legally questionableand did not interfere with the State's sludge management program. The requirement to document State or local bans or prohibitions has beendropped in the final rule. It is not essential for purposes of evaluatingthe adequacy of the State's program because the reasonableness of bansor prohibitions is not a requirement for approving State programs. In fact,the CWA specifically reserves the right of States and local governmentsto adopt and enforce stricter laws under section 510, and section 405(e)states in part that ``the determination of the manner of disposal or useof sludge is a local determination.'' Also, as commenters pointed out,compiling the list could require considerable resources. Given the lackof compelling need, EPA agrees that the potential burden of compiling aseparate document is not justified as a generic requirement for State programapproval. States still must submit copies of all State statutes and regulationsthat govern their program. Moreover, EPA still expects that in discussingthe State's legal authority, the Attorney General's Statement will identifywhere State laws are stricter or have broader coverage than Federal law.Although today's rule does not make the ``reasonableness'' of State orlocal restrictions a factor in determining whether to approve a State program,EPA encourages States to evaluate carefully whether such restrictions arejustified by environmental and public health concerns and to encouragelocal jurisdictions to do the same. The validity or status of a local prohibitionis typically a matter of State law. Therefore, to facilitate local sludgemanagement and planning, EPA encourages States to clarify and publicizethe status of local bans and prohibitions under State law.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Attorney General's Statement (Section 501.13) </ITAG>In the Attorney General's Statement (AGS), the State documents its legalauthority to carry out the program implementation requirements set forthin Part 501. With the AGS, the Attorney General (AG) certifies that, inhis or her opinion, the laws of the State provide adequate authority tocarry out the program. The AGS discusses the State's legal basis for conductingeach aspect of the program with citations to the specific statutory andregulatory provisions that authorize each program element, and an explanationof how each provision provides the requisite authority. It also addressesany significant difference between State and federal law. All referencedState statutes and regulations relied on in the AGS must be in full forceand effect by the time the program is approved. The 1986 and 1988 proposals regarding the Attorney General's Statementwere the same except in one minor respect. Under the February 1986 proposal,the AGS could be signed by the Attorney General ``or other appropriateState legal counsel.'' In the March 1988 proposal, EPA explained that thislanguage was not specific enough in requiring that the legal counsel signingthe AGS have full authority to represent the State agency. To remedy anyambiguity, the Agency proposed to adopt the language used in the NPDESState program regulations, andSection; 123.23. No commenters objected tothis proposed change and therefore it has been included in the final rule.Under today's final rule, the AGS must be signed by the Attorney Generalor a representative of the AG who is authorized to sign and can bind theState by so doing. Alternatively, the Statement may be signed by an independentlegal counsel. To qualify as an independent legal counsel, the signatorymust have full authority to represent the State agency in court on allmatters pertaining to the State program, including defending actions againstthe State and bringing actions to enforce against program violations. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Memorandum of Agreement (Section 501.14) </ITAG>The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) is a binding agreement between EPA andthe State which establishes the basis for cooperation and coordinationbetween them and for ensuring that the State program is administered inan effective manner consistent with the objectives of the Clean Water Act.The MOA defines the State/EPA relationship and the responsibilities ofeach party, charts the procedures EPA and the State will follow in carryingout these various responsibilities, and generally defines the manner inwhich the sludge management program will be administered. The main body of the MOA consists of a listing of the responsibilitiesand procedures which will be used to ensure coordination between the Stateand EPA. Under the March 1988 proposed rule, these included provisionsfor transferring permit applications and other program information fromEPA to the State; provisions that establish the frequency and content ofreports the State will submit to EPA; an agreement that the State willallow EPA routinely to review relevant State records, reports and files;provisions on the State's compliance monitoring and enforcement program,such as coordination with EPA on inspections and on enforcement activities;and procedures for modifying the MOA. Basic provisions regarding MOA requirements were essentially the same inthe 1986 and 1988 proposals. Three States and one environmental group submittedgeneral comments on the 1986 MOA proposal. One State objected to an MOAas redundant to having an acceptable program. Another State said an MOAwas unnecessary since no funds were involved. The third State said theMOA requirements were too specific and inflexible. In contrast, anothercommenter argued that the MOA requirements were not specific enough, particularlywith regard to the frequency and content of reports and information Statesare required to submit to EPA. EPA disagrees with the comments. The MOA is necessary to establish theroles and responsibilities of EPA and the State in administering the sludgeprogram and to detail how these activities will be carried out in the particularState. This agreement about the fundamentals of program administrationis independent of grant agreements or other funding agreements. Reachingthis agreement in advance reduces ambiguity and confusion as to expectationsbetween the State and EPA as to how the program will be run. While theregulations establish what must be addressed in the MOA (which may encompassrequirements established in other parts of the rule such as the semi-annualand annual reports) EPA and the State have flexibility in negotiating specificdetails (for example, the schedule for submitting required reports, whetherthe reports will be submitted separately or as an addition to existingreports, procedures for conducting joint inspections, etc.). EPA believesthat the final rule represents a reasonable balance between specificityand flexibility. These basic requirements of the MOA were not challenged further by commenterson the 1988 proposal and therefore the final rule remains substantiallythe same as the 1988 proposal. Minor changes and comments on specific provisionsare discussed below. Two States objected to provisions in the 1986 proposal to allow federalagency access to State records (similar to andSection; 501.14(b)(5) in the1988 proposal)_one for no stated reason, and the other because the requirementwas too specific or would duplicate other State submittals. EPA disagrees.Providing for EPA access to State records is not too specific because itis critical that the State and EPA reach agreement on this issue. EPA isunaware of other State submittals that duplicate this requirement. If aseparate agreement exists, the MOA simply could incorporate the agreementby reference. A major aspect of the MOA addressed by commenters concerned the proceduresfor EPA review of State permits. The proposed rule required EPA and theState to specify the classes or categories of permits that will be sentto EPA for review and comment, and the classes of permits for which suchreview will be waived. The proposed rule provided that EPA could waivereview for any class of sludge permits except for Class I sludge managementfacilities. It also specified that the MOA must also provide for terminationof the waiver, for individual permits and classes of permits, at the writtendirection of the Regional Administrator. One commenter recommended that EPA waive review of all permits except thoseissued to Class I facilities, i.e., facilities that can significantly affectthe environment. Similarly, another commenter opposed mandatory reviewexcept where there is a reasonable concern that the facility could adverselyaffect public health and the environment. Because the definition of a ClassI facility is designed to focus on the permittees most likely to adverselyaffect public health and the environment, limiting mandatory review toClass I facilities is consistent with these comments. Today's final ruledoes not categorically waive review of all non-Class I permits as the onecommenter suggested, but it does allow Regional Administrators, at theirdiscretion, to do so when negotiating MOAs with the States. The appropriatenessof waiving review of a particular type or class of non-Class I facilitieswill vary, depending on local conditions and other factors. For purposesof ensuring that State programs can assure compliance with section 405,it is important that EPA retain the ability to review any category or typeof permit. One commenter objected to this provision of the proposed rule on the groundsthat, under section 402(f) of the CWA, EPA cannot waive review of permitsexcept by regulation; therefore, deciding on the scope of the waiver inthe MOA would be inappropriate (since the MOA is not a regulation and thusis not subject to public notice and comment). EPA disagrees for severalreasons. First, the State program regulations in Part 501 that affect thepermitting aspects of the program are modelled on comparable provisionsin the NPDES program which, in turn, are governed by Section 402 of theCWA. However, EPA's authority for implementing the non-NPDES State programregulations is section 405(f) of the CWA. Therefore, what may or may notbe required under section 402(f) of the CWA is irrelevant, since this provisionimplements section 405(f), not section 402(f). Unfortunately, the proposedrule may have been misleading in this regard because it referred to section402(d)(3), (e), or (f) of the CWA. This was inadvertent and the citationhas been omitted in the final rule. In any event, EPA is in fact establishingby regulation the category of permits for which it may waive review, i.e.,all non-Class I facilities. What may be addressed in the MOA is the extentto which EPA will actually exercise its waiver. Finally, the MOA, alongwith other elements of the State's program submission, is subject to publicnotice and comment, upon initial program approval (see andSection; 501.31)and whenever a State's program is revised (see andSection; 50l.32(b)) (exceptin cases of nonsubstantial revisions). EPA proposed that the procedures and requirements in andSection; 123.44 governingEPA review of State-issued NPDES permits (including the authority to objectto, and, where necessary, veto permits that are outside the guidelinesand requirements of the CWA) generally apply as well to permits issuedunder State programs approved under Part 501. As explained in the preambleto the proposed rule, based on past experience in other programs, EPA believesthat the ability to veto State-issued permits which do not adequately implementFederal standards is an important tool for effectively assuring that Stateprograms implement Federal requirements. This approach is also consistentwith the NPDES program where EPA has authority to veto State-issued NPDESpermits that are not in accord with the guidelines and requirements ofthe Act (including those implementing sludge standards). There is no reasonwhy the availability of a veto authority should depend on whether a Statesludge program is approved under the NPDES program in Part 123 or separatelyunder Part 501. Therefore, the final rule is the same as the proposed rule.One commenter argued that without specific authority in the CWA, EPA cannotextend its existing NPDES veto authority to non-NPDES permits. As discussedabove, EPA is not relying on an expanded interpretation of veto authorityover State-issued NPDES permits in section 402 as the basis for assertingsimilar authority over non-NPDES State-issued permits with inadequate sludgeprovisions. Instead, it relies on the authority in section 405(f) to establishState program requirements as necessary to assure compliance with section405 requirements and its general rulemaking authority under section 501(a)of the CWA. The authority to review, object to, and veto State-issued permitsis a reasonable and necessary means to assure compliance with sludge standardsunder section 405. The commenter also objected to the proposed rule because it provided foran EPA veto based on the permit's failure to include case-by-case limitsnecessary to fulfill the statutory standard in section 405(d)(4) of theCWA (i.e., in the absence of an applicable Part 503 technical standard,conditions necessary to ``protect public health and the environment fromthe adverse effects that may occur from toxic pollutants in sewage sludge'').(Note: This provision appears as a revision to andSection; 123.44(c)(6),which is incorporated by reference into andSection; 501.14(b)(2)). In additionto denying that EPA has veto authority over non-NPDES permits, that commenterargued that section 402 limits EPA's veto authority to instances wherethe State issues a permit that does not follow the guidelines and requirementsof the Act, and that guidelines and requirements do not include unpublished,<T3>ad hoc</T3> determinations of EPA, citing in support case law interpretingsection 402 of the CWA. Moreover, the argument continues, EPA's authorityunder section 405(d)(4) expired in August 1988. It is important to emphasize that EPA expects that vetoes based on thepermit's failure to include conditions ``to protect public health and theenvironment from the adverse effects that may occur from toxic pollutantsin sewage sludge'' would be extremely rare. Such limits rely for theirdevelopment on the permit writer's ``best professional judgment'' basedon the facts in a particular case and therefore warrant considerable deference.However, it is necessary that EPA have the authority, in egregious cases,to veto a State-issued permit when it fails to protect public health andthe environment. EPA agrees that veto authority over State-issued permits cannot be unlimited.However, it disagrees that the proposed rule exceeds EPA's authority underthe CWA. ``Guidelines and Requirements of the Act'' includes requirementsunder section 405(d)(4) of the Act. Recently, the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the D.C. Circuit upheld the NPDES veto authority regulation under thesecriteria. <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>859 F.2d 156, 187, 28 ERC 1401,  1426 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Inaddition, EPA has published a guidance document called the ``Guidance forWriting Case-by-Case Permit Requirements for Municipal Sewage Sludge''(USEPA, Permits Division, September 1988) which explains how it intendssection 405(d)(4) to be implemented. Also, as explained in section V.E.above, EPA interprets the directive to take appropriate measures to protectpublic health and the environment under section 405(d)(4) (including theauthority to develop permit conditions on a case-by-case basis and to vetoa State-issued permit that does not adequately protect public health andthe environment) as a continuing responsibility that applies in the absenceof an applicable Part 503 technical regulation. Therefore, it disagreesthat its authority under section 405(d)(4) expires on any certain date,regardless of when applicable technical standards are promulgated. One commenter stated that EPA oversight should be limited to POTWs andshould consist of on-site evaluation of the State's program for purposesof approving the program. This suggests that EPA oversight of individualState permits should be eliminated. EPA disagrees for the reasons statedabove. This does not mean that EPA should or will maintain the same levelof oversight after program approval regardless of State performance. Thepurpose of EPA's oversight is to assure that an approved State continuesto administer a program that adequately implements Federal standards andmeets minimum program requirements. As with program approval, EPA cannotdetermine when less oversight might be warranted on an on-going basis inthe absence of information about the State's performance. One commenter said that andSection; 501.14(c)(2), which governs EPA receiptof final State permits, was inadequate because EPA must routinely receivecopies of final permits so that it has a basis for determining whetherto rescind its permit waiver, consistent with the current NPDES programrequirements. Section 501.14(c)(2) requires States to send EPA copies offinal permits (i.e., permits as they are finally issued after the publicand EPA comment periods) for all Class I facilities, but requires submittalof final permits for non-Class I facilities only upon request by EPA. Thisdiffers from the corresponding NPDES provision, which requires submittalof all final permits. In Part 501, EPA limited the routine submission offinal permits to Class I permits to reduce the paperwork burden on EPAand the States and because, as a practical matter, these are the only permitslikely to be reviewed in any detail. Requiring States to submit all finalpermits therefore does not serve any significant purpose. EPA agrees thatroutinely receiving all final permits would provide readily available informationfor determining whether to rescind its permit review waiver. However, itis not the only basis for this determination and State permits always remainfully accessible to EPA. In fact, nothing in the final rule precludes EPAfrom requiring routine submission of all final permits. Whether such submissionis necessary is left to the discretion of the Regional Administrator. Two States objected to the 90-day period for EPA review of State draftpermits. One said that it would interfere with a State requirement thatpermits be issued within six months of a completed application; further,the information could be outdated by the time of permit issuance, and inany event, EPA could not meaningfully review site-specific permits withoutsite inspection and familiarity with the permit application. The othercommenter said that the 90-day review period was incompatible with issuingpermits for land application sites which are numerous, frequently not identifiablein advance, and cannot wait for lengthy periods of time. This State alsosaid that it issued new permits every year and therefore a 90-day reviewperiod could cripple its permitting program. Ninety days is a reasonable time for EPA review. It should be noted thatEPA may waive review for a large number of permits. In some cases, Statesmay have to adjust their permitting procedures to accommodate EPA review.Generally, however, the 90-day review period should not interfere withthe commenter's six-month requirement except where there is a problem withthe permits. EPA should have sufficient information to determine whetheror not the permit is within the guidelines and requirements of the Actsince the basis for permit limits should be explained in the fact sheet.The requirements for EPA review of individual permits assume that permitsare reissued every five years. States which choose to reissue permits morefrequently will have to decide whether such frequent reissuance is desirablein light of the 90-day EPA review period. In addition, as explained elsewhere,EPA has provided alternate procedures for covering individual land applicationsites that do not require issuance of separate permits for each land applicationsite when the generator's permit includes an approved land applicationprogram. This should significantly reduce the number of permits (e.g.,site permits) which must be submitted to EPA for the 90-day review periodand consequently minimize the concerns raised by the commenter.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Permitting Requirements and Procedures (Section 501.15) </ITAG><T3>General. </T3>This section was added to the proposed Part 501 in theMarch 1988 proposal in response to the 1987 amendments to the Clean WaterAct, which required a permit program as the primary mechanism for implementingthe technical standards for sludge use and disposal. In developing the regulations to implement this requirement, the NPDESpermitting program was used as the basis for the specific provisions proposedin Part 501. The proposal set forth the specific requirements for ensuringeffective permitting programs and was divided into four principal subsections.Paragraph (a) specified general requirements the State must be able toimplement and standards for program implementation. Paragraph (b) listedboilerplate provisions which all permits must contain. Paragraph (c) containedprovisions for permit actions such as transfers, modification, revocationand reissuance, and termination. Paragraph (d) contained procedures forpermit issuance. In addition, paragraph (e) listed optional program provisions.Overall, the final rule is substantially the same as the proposed rule.The section has been slightly reorganized, however, by creating a new paragraph(f) at the end of this section which now contains the conflict-of-intereststandard for State permitting boards (andSection; 501.15(a)(7) in the March1988 proposal). Most of the provisions in this section have counterpartsin the revisions to Parts 122 and 124, also promulgated today, and havebeen discussed in the context of those revisions. Discussion of those provisionswill not be repeated in this part of the preamble. The provisions not alreadydiscussed elsewhere in the preamble are addressed below. <T3>Public access to information. </T3>Section 501.15(a)(1) deals withconfidentiality of information and requires the State to deny claims ofconfidentiality for: (1) The name and address of the permittee, and (2)permits, permit applications and effluent data. The State may protect otherinformation claimed as confidential. This proposal is consistent with theconfidentiality rules in the NPDES program (andSection; 122.7), which aremandated by sections 308 and 402(j) of the Clean Water Act. The final ruleis the same as the proposed rule. EPA received only one comment on this section. The commenter generallyrequested that the regulations ensure that citizens have access to publicrecords and the ``standard be rigid and not subject to State or local interpretation* * *.'' As a preface to this comment, the commenter reported difficultywith obtaining records directly from the regulated party and being toldby a State agency that it would be charged for the actual cost of obtainingrequested public records. Today's final rule balances the public interest in access to informationand the permittee's interest in confidentiality. It does not require apermittee to respond directly to public requests for information, but insteadrequires the permittee to submit necessary information to the permittingauthority. This permitting authority must make the information listed inandSection; 501.15(a)(1) available to the public. States are not precludedfrom charging ``actual costs'' for providing copies of public records.EPA believes this is a reasonable requirement. (In fact, EPA's own rulesregarding public access to information allow the Agency to charge ``reasonablefees.'' See 40 CFR Part 2.) <T3>Permit application information. </T3>Section 501.15(a)(2) lists theinformation States must be able to obtain from a permit applicant. Theseinformation requirements have undergone changes from the proposal whichare explained in the discussion about revisions to andSection; 122.21, theNPDES permit application section. In addition, also as explained in thatdiscussion, a new paragraph has been added to Part 501 (andSection; 501.15(d)(1))to specify when permit applications must be submitted. Paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) in the proposed rule addressed retention ofpermit application data and who must sign permit applications. The finalrule on signatory requirements is the same as the proposed rule, sincethe Agency received no comments on this issue. The final rule concerning record retention (paragraph (a)(3)) requiresthat records be retained five years rather than three years as proposed.The Agency had proposed that monitoring and application information mustbe retained for three years by permit holders and sought comment on whetherpermit holders should be required to retain records for five years to coincidewith the term of the permit. Nine State agencies, one POTW, one industrytrade association, one environmental group and one member of the publicprovided comments. Five commenters recommended that EPA require that recordsbe retained for three years. They counseled that three years was adequate,appropriate and consistent with other Federal environmental programs suchas NPDES and RCRA, and that there would be no advantage to a five-yearterm as regulators can require that records be kept longer than three yearswhen needed for an enforcement action. One noted that while permit holdersshould be required to retain records for only three years, States shouldkeep records for a longer period. Eight commenters supported requiring that permit holders retain recordsfor five years or for a longer period. One commenter noted that a five-yearperiod would be consistent with the Federal statute of limitations forClean Water Act violations. Several commenters recommended that recordsof sludge loading rates at land application sites and of sludge qualityanalyses for sludges reused at these sites should be kept indefinitely.One commenter recommended that, at a minimum, records should be retainedfor the life of the facility. One commenter noted that POTWs must haverecords to document any potential limitations or liabilities for theirpast, present, and future sludge management programs. After considering these comments, EPA has decided to require that permitholders retain records for a period of five years, or longer where requiredby the Part 503 technical regulations. EPA chose to require a five-yearperiod because the Federal statute of limitations for CWA violations isfive years.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Records may not be destroyed during an enforcement action.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">A five-year period also coincides with the maximum permit term andensures that all records will be available when the application for a newpermit is submitted and reviewed. EPA recognizes that a five-year recordretention period is longer than is currently required for NPDES and RCRArecordkeeping; nevertheless, the Agency finds the arguments for a five-yearperiod in the case of regulating sewage sludge to be compelling. (For thisreason also, today's final rule revises andSection; 122.21(p) to specifythat sludge application data must be retained five years or longer if requiredby Part 503.) In many cases, permittees may have cumulative limits in theirpermits, so that it will be important to track sludge information overlonger periods of time. The Agency considered the additional burden thefive-year retention time might impose on permittees, but determined thatthis burden would be less than other alternatives, such as requiring thepermittee to summarize and ``rollover'' information every three years,which would be necessary if permittees were required to retain recordsfor only three years. Tying the record retention time to the permit termfacilitates the carryover of this information on cumulative loadings frompermit to permit, easing the burden for both permittees and permittingauthorities. While EPA will not set such a requirement in today's rule, as a matterof guidance, the Agency believes that it is prudent for States to requirethat permit holders retain records of cumulative heavy metal loadings toland application sites longer than five years. Records of heavy metal loadingsshould be retained as these compounds tend to accumulate at sites withlittle diminution over time. In contrast, organic pollutants tend to breakdown due to microbial action and exposure to climate. The proposed Part503 regulations will include limits based on cumulative heavy metal loadings.Thus, there needs to be a way to ensure that these loadings are not exceededbeyond a five-year timeframe. This may be accomplished by having the permitteeor the State retain the records. An alternative approach would be to requirethat a summary of heavy metal loadings to land application sites be preparedevery five years and signatures attached attesting to the accuracy of theinformation. The summary could be retained for five years, revised beforethe next round of records for land application sites is disposed, and thenew summary retained. Another option might be to take soil samples. Thechoice is up to the State. In the program description, the State must describehow it plans to ensure that metals are not being applied to the land inexcess of the requirements. <T3>Permit duration. </T3>Under the proposed andSection; 501.15(a)(5), sludgepermits could be issued for a term of up to five years. The preamble discussionto the proposed rule explained that because many of the requirements willbe new, a longer permit term would be inappropriate. The State may, ofcourse, write permits for a shorter term. Two States and one POTW questioned the need to limit permits to five years.One State noted that the Act does not limit the permit term. Another saidthat a five-year term would conflict with the Paperwork Reduction Act.Comments suggested that ten year permits are used in at least two States.As explained in the preamble, many of the requirements in the permits willbe new. Therefore, it is important to periodically review the permit. Fiveyears is a reasonable term and is consistent with the maximum term forNPDES permits. Nothing in the Paperwork Reduction Act governs permit durationand therefore fixing a permit term in today's regulation does not conflictwith that statute. Many of the commenters' concerns may reflect a misunderstanding of whowill be required to obtain permits. Today's rule would require maximumfive year permit terms only for facilities required to have permits underfederal law, i.e., treatment works for whom Part 503 standards have beenpromulgated. The five-year limit would not necessarily apply, however,to State-issued permits required under State law for individual land applicationsites or sludge treatment processes. Where States use permits that arenot mandated by the CWA or this Part, they may set permit terms they deemappropriate. The only requirement would be that the permit requirementsand procedures could not interfere with the State's ability to requirecompliance with the Part 503 technical standards by the statutory deadline.<T3>Compliance schedules</T3>. Paragraph (a)(6) provides that schedulesof compliance may be used (but are by no means mandatory), except thata State may not issue a permit with a compliance schedule which goes beyondthe statutory deadline. CWA section 405 mandates that compliance with thePart 503 technical standards be achieved by one year from the date of theirpromulgation, except where the standards would require major construction,in which case the permittee has up to two years to achieve compliance.Where a compliance schedule goes beyond one year, this section would requireinterim requirements and reporting to ensure that the permittee is on schedule.Given the relatively tight statutory deadlines (even assuming the technicalregulations require major construction), some commenters questioned theutility of compliance schedules. Obviously, compliance schedules in permitswill have a more limited application in the sludge program than has beenthe case in the NPDES and other programs. However, EPA believes the prudentcourse is to provide for compliance schedules in the regulations now, ratherthan wait until their need appears more widespread. <T3>Permit conditions. </T3>Section 501.15(b) is the second principal subsection,and sets forth the permit conditions all State permits would need to containin order for the program to be approvable. These provisions are importantbecause they put the permittee on notice as to the applicability of CleanWater Act provisions, and identify the effect of the permit with regardto compliance and non-compliance with the Clean Water Act for enforcementpurposes. The first paragraph of andSection; 501.15(b) requires that the permit includerequirements (which may vary from permittee to permittee and thereforeneed to be developed individually for each permit) necessary to complywith the Part 503 sludge standards and generally the requirement in CWAsection 405(d) to protect public health and the environment. This includesrequirements as to sludge quality, monitoring frequency, management practices,etc. The final rule has been changed from the proposed rule to specify thatpermits for POTWs and other generators required to obtain a permit undersection 405(f) must contain conditions addressing at least sludge qualityand related conditions (monitoring and reporting). However, as explainedin the discussion about users and disposers above in section V.D.3 of thispreamble, the generator's permit need not contain Part 503 technical standardsapplicable to its sludge use or disposal option that address site limitationsif those limitations have been included in a permit issued to the siteowner or operator. Paragraph (b) also requires that States be able to include a number of``boilerplate'' permit conditions in permits. Several of these relate tothe permittee's liability under the Clean Water Act for sludge use anddisposal activities. These include provisions specifying that: The permitteemust comply with all conditions, and that noncompliance with any of thepermit conditions constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act; the permitteemust comply with the Part 503 technical standards, even if the permit hasnot been modified to incorporate them (see also discussion above concerning``permit as a shield,'' revisions to Part 122 regulations, and paragraph(13) of this section); and informing the permittee of the civil and criminalpenalties in the Clean Water Act for permit violations and noncompliancewith section 405. This section also contains several other boilerplate permit conditionswhich a State must be able to include in permits issued under the approvedprogram. These permit conditions specify that: It is not a defense in casesof noncompliance to claim that it would have been necessary to halt orreduce the permitted activity in order to comply (paragraph (4)); the permitteemust take all reasonable steps to prevent sludge use or disposal in violationof the permit which has a reasonable likelihood of adversely affectinghealth or the environment (paragraph (5)); the permittee must at all timesproperly operate and maintain facilities and systems (paragraph (6)); thepermit may be modified, revoked and reissued, or terminated for cause (paragraph(7)); the Director may request information to determine compliance, orwhether cause exists to modify or terminate the permit, and the permitteehas an obligation to furnish such information within a reasonable time(paragraph (8)); the permittee must allow the Director or an authorizedrepresentative to enter onto the premises, inspect the facility, have accessto records and conduct sampling (paragraph (9)); the permittee must monitorand report monitoring data no less frequently than once a year or morefrequently as specified by the Part 503 standards or where the permit writerdetermines that additional or more frequent monitoring is needed, monitoringmust be representative of the monitored activity, parameters for monitoredinformation will be set forth in the permit, monitoring must be conductedin accordance with procedures established under 40 CFR Part 136 or part503 unless others have been specified in the permit, and anyone who falsifies,tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or methodor makes a false statement or representation is subject to Clean WaterAct criminal penalties (paragraph (10)); the signatory requirements in40 CFR 122.22 must be followed (paragraph (11)); the permittee must giveadvance notice to the Director of any planned changes in the sludge disposalpractices or facilities that may justify the application of different permitconditions, or which may result in noncompliance with the permit, mustalso report all instances of noncompliance, and notify the Director beforetransferring the permit (paragraph (12)); and a reopener clause, to providefor permit modification or revocation and reissuance where more stringenttechnical standards than are currently in the permit are promulgated (paragraph(13)). In most cases, these boilerplate provisions are the same as the proposedrule. Several of the provisions generated comments which have been addressedin the discussion of the final revisions to Part 122. Only three changeshave been made to the final rule. The first, a minor change discussed earlier,involves specifying in paragraph (10) that the permit must include anymonitoring requirements (including frequency requirements) necessary toimplement Part 503 technical standards. The second involves adding a requiredboilerplate condition based on 40 CFR 122.41(b) that notifies the permitteeof its duty to reapply for a new permit if it plans to continue the permittedactivity beyond the expiration date of its current permit. (The reasonfor this change is explained in the Part 122 discussion above in sectionV.F.)The third change involves andSection; 501.15(b)(6) which establishes theduty of proper operation and maintenance. The proposed rule was taken directlyfrom andSection; 122.41(e), except that it did not include the last sentenceto the paragraph which states: ``This provision requires the operationof back-up or auxiliary facilities or similar systems which are installedby the permittee only when the operation is necessary to achieve compliancewith the conditions of the permit.'' One commenter objected to the omissionof this sentence in the Part 501 counterpart on the grounds that the sentenceresulted from a successful industry challenge to the NPDES regulationsand that it was equally applicable to the sludge situation. EPA's authority for promulgating today's regulation is different from itsauthority to promulgate NPDES regulations. Therefore, EPA disagrees thatany litigation or other action affecting the NPDES regulations would necessarilyaffect a comparable sludge regulation. Nonetheless, EPA agrees that thesentence omitted from the proposed andSection; 501.15(b)(6) has validityin the sludge program and therefore has included it in the final rule.This sentence clarifies that back-up equipment or facilities are not requiredas a matter of course; instead, they are required only when necessary tomaintain compliance with the permit. One situation might be where regulardowntime for a particular process or piece of equipment can be reasonablyanticipated and stopping operations is not a feasible alternative for maintainingcompliance (e.g., back-up dewatering equipment might be necessary if allof the POTW's sludge is disposed of at a co-disposal landfill that doesnot accept materials containing free liquids). This provision does notrequire that permittees develop contingency plans (as the 1986 proposalwould have required). Whether contingency plans are needed must be determinedon a case-by-case basis. It is important to note that this paragraph states a general duty of allpermittees. It would not supersede or otherwise affect a specific Part503 requirement addressing operation and maintenance requirements. It alsoincludes a duty to operate and maintain adequate laboratory controls andappropriate quality assurance (QA/QC) procedures. Thus, permittees shouldkeep records of QA/QC results. <T3>Permit actions. </T3>Section 501.15(c) discusses procedures for permitactions. This covers permit transfers, permit modification, permit termination,and permit issuance. Paragraph (1) addresses permit transfers, and sets out procedures for automatictransfer so that permit modification or revocation and reissuance can beavoided in some instances. One commenter said that the automatic transferprovision should be deleted because decisions about permit transfers mayinvolve several factors (e.g., bonding, compliance issues). Under today'sfinal rule, a State need not adopt the automatic transfer provision aspart of the their program in order to obtain EPA approval. Editorial changesto the final rule clarify that providing for automatic transfers is discretionary.States may always choose to omit required provisions if the result is amore stringent requirement. (States must be able to prohibit transferswithout prior notice, however.) Even under the automatic transfer provision,the State Director can prevent an automatic transfer simply by notifyingthe current permittee that he or she intends to modify or revoke and reissuethe permit. Paragraph (2) discusses permit modification, and revocation and reissuance.When permits are modified, only the provisions subject to the modificationare reopened. Permits may be modified only for cause as defined in (2)(ii).For example, the promulgation of new technical sludge standards by EPAwould be cause for modifying the permit. Permit revocation and reissuanceis more severe; the entire permit is reopened and subject to revision andthe permit reissued for a new term. Revocation and reissuance can onlybe done in three circumstances: (1) cause exists for termination, but theDirector decides to revoke and reissue; (2) cause exists for modificationonly, but the permittee agrees to revocation and reissuance; or (3) theDirector has received notice of a proposed permit transfer under andSection;501.15(b)(12)(iii). (A permit may also be modified to reflect a transfer.)This paragraph is the same in the final rule as it was in the proposed.Most comments addressing permissible causes for modifying a permit centeredon the promulgation of applicable Part 503 standards during a permit term.This issue, as well as other comments on the causes for modifying a permit,are discussed in detail in section V.F.2 above. As explained in that discussion,the final rule contains a new cause for modification to approve land applicationsplans. The most severe permit action, termination of the permit, is describedin paragraph (3). Permits can be terminated (or permit renewal applicationsdenied) for four reasons: (1) Noncompliance; (2) permittee's failure todisclose all relevant facts; (3) the permitted activity endangers healthor the environment and can be adequately regulated only by modifying orterminating the permit; and (4) a change in condition that requires eitherreduction or elimination of the permitted activity. EPA received no significantcomments on this provision and accordingly is promulgating a final rulethat is the same as the proposed rule. <T3>Permit issuance procedures. </T3>Subsection 501.15(d) describes thepermit issuance procedures that the State would need the authority to administer.In addition to typical procedures for licensing type actions, this sectionsets forth minimum provisions to ensure adequate public participation.The State may of course provide for more extensive public involvement,e.g., by providing lengthier public comment periods, requiring more publichearings, having more extensive public notice, etc. One commenter said generally that the permit procedures in andSection; 501.15(d)were too cumbersome and time-consuming for ``simple permits'' such as forthe transport of sludge from one plant to another for further processing.This comment reflects a misunderstanding about when a permit is requiredunder Part 501. Separate permits are not needed each time sludge is transported.Permits issued to treatment works may be effective for up to five yearsand should comprehensively address the treatment works' method(s) of sludgeuse and disposal during that period. Part 503 does not propose to regulatethe transportation of sludge. Whether conditions are needed in the permitto address sludge transportation would thus be decided on a case-by-casebasis as necessary to protect public health and the environment. In thisevent, the conditions would be included in the permit at the time of issuance.Permit modifications would be necessary, however, if the permittee wantsto use a sludge use or disposal method not addressed in the permit or toincorporate applicable Part 503 standards promulgated after issuance ofthe permit.The first paragraph describes minimum application procedures and providesthat the State Agency must not commence processing a permit until the applicanthas fully satisfied the application requirements discussed in andSection;501.15(a)(2). It differs from the proposed rule in one important respect.The subparagraph describing when persons subject to the permitting requirementunder section 405(f) (i.e., treatment works treating domestic sewage) mustbe required to submit their applications has been expanded to address POTWsand privately-owned sewage treatment works separately, consistent withchanges made to 40 CFR 122.21, explained in section V.F.2 above. (Note:Part 501 does not address ``sludge-only facilities'' separately as doesPart 122. ``Sludge-only facilities'' by definition only exist when EPAis the permit-issuing authority.) The effect of this change is to clarifythat permit applications, and hence permits, generally are not requiredfor non-POTWs until promulgation of a Part 503 standard applicable to theirsludge or sludge use or disposal practice. Section 501.15(d)(2) sets forth procedures for permit modification, revocationand reissuance, and termination. Interested persons may petition the Directorto take such action by written request, or he may do so on his own initiative,provided that one of the reasons specified in andSection; 501.15(c) exists.No comments addressed these procedures. The final rule is the same as theproposed rule. Paragraph (3) requires draft permits to be prepared where the Directortentatively decides to issue the permit, and whenever the permit is modified,revoked and reissued, or terminated. A draft permit must include all ofthe conditions required to be in the permit under the provisions of andSection;501.15 (which includes conditions required for compliance with Part 503).Today's final rule on when draft permits must be prepared is the same asthe proposed rule. Additional revisions to this paragraph for land applicationplans are discussed in section V.F.2 above. One State suggested that draft permits be required only when public hearingsare held and also expressed the view that draft permits are generally unnecessaryand cause delays. EPA disagrees. Draft permits inform interested persons(including the permit applicant) about what the permitting authority proposedto require of the permittee during the term of the permit and thus providethe basis for comments on the permits (and for determining whether to requesta public hearing). This allows potential problems with the permit to beidentified and, if appropriate, resolved before final issuance. Draft permitsare a key element of the permitting issuance process. The importance ofthis process is explained in the more detail above in section V.G.2. Paragraph (4) discusses fact sheets. Under today's final rule, State programsmust prepare a fact sheet for permits issued to any ``Class I Sludge ManagementFacility,'' or when the permit contains conditions developed on a case-by-casebasis to protect public health and the environment. The purpose of thefact sheet is to explain the basis for any permit condition and thus allowmeaningful public comments on the draft permit. Accordingly, the fact sheetis required to set out the significant factual, legal, methodological,and policy questions considered in preparing the draft permit, includinga brief description of the facility and the use and disposal practices,and an explanation of how the limits and conditions for sludge use anddisposal were derived. Fact sheets also must be prepared whenever a permitincludes a land application plan, and must explain how each required elementof the land application plan is addressed. The requirements governing fact sheets in this section are the same requirementsapplicable to fact sheets in the NPDES program. Changes in the fact sheetrequirements made in response to comments on the proposed rule are explainedin the discussion of revisions to Part 124 in section V.G.2 above. Public notice and comment procedures are the subject of paragraph (5).Under today's final rule, the State program must require that the Directorgive public notice of the draft permit and if a public hearing has beenscheduled. The public notice must identify the name and address of theprocessing office, the name and address of the applicant, a brief descriptionof the activity described in the permit application (e.g., sludge incineration),whether the permit includes a land application plan, and a descriptionof the procedures for submitting comments. The notice must provide forno less than a 30-day comment period during which any interested personmay submit written comments and request a public hearing. Where the noticeis for a public hearing, the notice must designate the date, time, andplace of the hearing, and specify its nature and purpose. One State, commenting generally on the public notice procedures, urgedEPA to reconsider requiring these procedures for all States, even thoughits State already had public notice procedures comparable to those in theproposed rule. This commenter explained that, in the State's experience,responding to public comments demanded a great deal of time and efforton the part of the technical staff. In a related vein, another commenterremarked that in its experience public participation resulted in decisionsnot to issue permits because of public misperceptions about sludge. EPArecognizes that public participation may place additional demands on Stateprograms. Some of this demand may result from public misunderstanding.However, encouraging public participation in permit and enforcement actionsis an important goal of the CWA. EPA views public involvement as supportiveof implementing the requirements and goals of the CWA. While demandingresources in the short term, it ultimately benefits the sludge programby helping to educate the public about sludge use and disposal. As recognizedby the State commenter, public awareness and understanding is criticalto public acceptance of sludge use and disposal, particularly beneficialreuse of sludge. Two States and one POTW submitted comments opposing public notice for draftpermits. One State said that the regulations should not require publicnotice; instead, State requirements should prevail. EPA believes that minimumprocedural requirements are important to provide consistency among Stateprograms and to provide for public participation in the permitting process.See section 101(e) of the CWA. One State recommended that instead of requiring public notice of the draftpermit, that EPA allow public notice of permit applications so that thepublic comment period would run concurrently with the State review of theapplication and also would allow public comments to be incorporated intothe review letter. Without more information, it is not possible to determinewhether this alternative scheme is functionally equivalent to that in theproposed rule. The purpose of the public notice is to allow public participationon the issue of whether or not the conditions in the permit ensure compliancewith the CWA, not just whether the permit applicant has submitted completeand accurate information. Therefore, unless the permit application underthe State's program is essentially the same as the draft permit under Part501 (i.e., it sets out how the permittee will comply with applicable requirements,including those required by Parts 501 and 503), public notice of the applicationwould be of limited value. Another suggested alternative was to allow public notice of the disposerpermit (which allows for consideration of site-specific concerns) to suffice.Again, without more information EPA cannot determine this would be an acceptablealternative. However, under today's final rule, permits for the sludgegenerator generally will be required regardless of whether permits fordisposers are also required. Public notice of the draft permit for thegenerator would be required under today's final rule.One commenter asked that the regulations be revised so that they do notrequire a separate public notice for sludge management plans when the planis a part of a permit and the permit reissuance process already providesfor public notice. Nothing in today's final rule requires a separate orduplicative public notice in this situation. The public notice requirementscan be met through existing public notice procedures as long as they meetthe minimum requirements established in andSection; 501.15(d)(5) of today'srule regarding when notice is required, how and to whom it must be given,and what the notice must contain. As the commenter noted, this may be easilyaccomplished by revising existing permit reissuance procedures. One commenter, who generally supported the public notice requirements forindividual permit actions, suggested that andSection; 501.15(d)(5)(ii)(B)be revised to indicate the public notice requirements for Class I sludgemanagement facilities in that paragraph are in addition to the public noticerequirements in andSection; 501.15(d)(5)(ii)(A), which apply to all permits.This suggested revision clarifies the Agency's intent and accordingly hasbeen adopted in the final rule. Several other commenters addressed public notice in the context of permitsfor land application of sewage sludge. This issue is discussed at lengthin the earlier discussion about land application plans. (See section V.F.2of this preamble). Briefly, today's proposed rule establishes special rulesfor land application programs to meet the special needs of that use optionand thus to encourage beneficial reuse of sludge. The State regulations must specify that public comments will be consideredbefore making a final decision; that significant comments will be respondedto in writing and made available to the public; and that any provisionsin the final permit which differ from the proposed permit will be notedand explained in the written response to comments. Under today's rule, State-issued general permits will not be subject toreview by EPA's Office of Water Enforcement and Permits, as andSection; 123.44(a)(2)provides for NPDES general permits, but would be reviewed by the EPA Regionto the same extent as other State-issued sludge permits (i.e., minimally,all permits for Class I facilities must be reviewed by the Region). Statesconsidering the use of general permits for sludge should so indicate intheir program description and Attorney General's Statement, and make surethat State law would allow issuance of general permits. <T3>Optional permitting provisions. </T3>Section andSection; 501.15(e) listsoptional program provisions. These provisions, which the State is not requiredto adopt, are currently in the NPDES program and generally make the programless stringent or easier to administer. If the State decides to adopt generalpermits, permit continuation, or minor modification of permits for sludge,its provisions must be no less stringent than the corresponding Federalprovisions identified in paragraph (e). EPA received no comments on thissection. The final rule includes a new provision, however, listing the newly createdaffirmative defense in andSection; 122.5. Although this provision, a modified``permit as a shield'' protection for compliance with Part 503-based permitlimits, applies as a matter of Federal law, it would not necessarily applyunder State law. States, however, may determine that the affirmative defensewould be important for their programs for the same reasons as EPA. As withother provisions listed in this paragraph, States may, but need not, adoptthese provisions as part of an approved program. However, if the Statedecides to adopt one, it must be no less stringent than the provisionsreferenced in this section. <T3>Conflict of interest standard for permitting authority. </T3>In the1988 proposal, the Agency proposed to use the conflict-of-interest rulesthat applied to NPDES State programs (andSection; 123.25(c)) for non-NPDESsludge management programs. Section 123.25(c) requires that no member ofa board or body which approves a permit receives or has for the past twoyears received income from permit holders or applicants. Since the NPDESstandard for conflict-of-interest is considered relatively stringent, EPAsolicited comments on whether another standard would be more appropriate.In particular, the Agency discussed an alternative which would allow aState that used a program approved under another Federal statute as thebasis for its sludge program under Part 501 to comply with the conflict-of-interestprovision applicable under the other Federal statute (e.g., section 128of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C 7248). The proposed rule addressing conflict-of-interest generated few comments.Three commenters, including two States, supported adopting the NPDES standard.One commenter, however, said that rather than prohibiting membership, EPAshould instead require recusal in cases of direct conflict-of-interest.However, recusal only for individual instances of actual conflict-of-interestoffers little assurance that the integrity of the permitting program willbe protected. Adopting such a standard also would create a significantdisparity in requirements between NPDES and non-NPDES sludge managementprogram that would be difficult to justify. Therefore, EPA has decidedto issue a final rule that adopts the NPDES conflict-of-interest standard. The final rule also would allow an alternative standard used in other EPA-approvedState programs or the equivalent of such a standard. The only alternativestandard EPA is aware of is the conflict-of-interest standard establishedin section 128 of the Clean Air Act. This standard is described in sectionV.I.1 above.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>NPDES State sewage sludge management programs would haveto meet the conflict-of-interest requirements in andSection; 123.25(c), whichare mandated by section 304(i) of the CWA. The alternate confict-of-intereststandard is available only for non-NPDES State sludge management programs.</ITAG>Under the conflict-of-interest regulations promulgated today, State agenciesor departments are not considered ``permit holders or applicants for apermit.'' Section 501.15(f)(1). Without this exemption, many States couldnot administer an approved program because State agencies often hold permits.A similar exemption for federal agencies or departments is being consideredand may be addressed in the forthcoming proposed revisions to the NPDESregulations. It is not a part of today's final rule, however. Municipalities, on the other hand, may be ``permit holders or applicantsfor a permit.'' Under the proposed rule, employees of a municipality thatowns or operates a facility required to obtain a permit could not sit onthe board or body that approves all or portions of sludge permits issuedin an approved State. One commenter noted that this proposed rule wouldprohibit municipalities that own or operate POTWs required to obtain permitsfrom regulating septage disposal within their jurisdiction, as is oftenthe case. Under the final rule, this conflict-of-interest requirement hasbeen relaxed somewhat so as to allow for assignment of program responsibilitiesto local agencies if an alternative conflict-of-interest standard can bemet by the permit issuing board or body. This change is explained in moredetail in section V.I.1. above. One commenter suggested that because municipalities and counties oftenregulate septage disposal, the conflict-of-interest provision should beincorporated into the MOA. Thus, a State which currently has conflict-of-interestregulations could be allowed to use these regulations in its sludge managementprogram. This comment is unclear. However, to the extent that the commenteris suggesting the State be allowed to negotiate in the MOA for a conflict-of-intereststandard that would allow municipal regulation of septage disposal to continuedespite the conflict of interest standard in Part 501, EPA declines toadopt such an approach as it has too much potential for inconsistent requirementsamong programs. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Compliance Evaluation Program (Section 501.16) </ITAG>This section would require that States have requirements and proceduresfor compliance monitoring and evaluation. The proposed rule adopted byreference 40 CFR 123.26. (The 1986 proposal also used andSection; 123.26as the basis for compliance monitoring program requirements). Section 405of the Clean Water Act makes it unlawful for any person to use or disposeof sewage sludge except in accordance with the Part 503 standards. Thus,it is important that the State's compliance monitoring program cover non-permittees(e.g., disposal sites) as well as permittees. Most comments on this section were received in response to the 1986 proposedrule rather than on the March 1988 proposal. Several States objected tothis section as being too detailed, depriving States of program flexibility,and therefore requested that it be deleted. Flexibility is an importantgoal, but it is not a sufficient reason in itself to leave an entire, criticalcomponent of the sludge management program to individual States' discretion.As noted by another commenter, minimum uniform standards for State programsare just as important in the area of compliance monitoring as in otherareas of approved State programs. Accordingly, EPA proposed requirementsthat in its experience are the ``bare essentials'' for an adequate compliancemonitoring program. Comments on specific aspects of the proposal are consideredbelow. One comment addressed the requirement that the State use procedures forhandling samples that would allow those samples to be admissible in court,i.e., employ chain of custody procedures. (<T3>See </T3>40 CFR 123.26(d).) The commenter said that although therewere sound reasons for requiring ``litigation quality'' samples, the extraexpense was not worth it in all cases. The commenter suggested that instead,this subject be addressed in guidance to allow States to better allocatefinancial resources. Chain of custody procedures ensure that samples are not altered betweenthe time they are taken and the time they may be needed as proof of violationsin an enforcement action. When such procedures are not followed, it maybe difficult to establish the integrity of the sample and get the resultsadmitted as evidence. Therefore, the regulations require chain of custodyprocedures when samples are taken for purposes of determining compliance.In EPA's experience, chain of custody procedures add minimal costs to samplingprograms. Generally, chain of custody procedures merely require that alog to record basic information about the sample (e.g., date and placecollected) and certification by handlers that the sample has not been alteredbe kept as the sample is moved from one place or person to the next. Certainly,following these procedures costs less than would the alternative of resamplingwhere noncompliance has been detected (but where chain of custody procedureswere not used) in order to establish an evidentiary basis for the enforcementaction. One commenter suggested that compliance evaluation programs be requiredto specifically address potential effects of synthetic organic chemicalsin sewage sludge which may be disposed of in landfills or applied to foodchain crops. This suggestion is based on concerns about the suspected carcinogenic,mutagenic, and teratogenic effects of synthetic organic chemicals thatare being detected in sewage sludge from treatment facilities in highlyindustrialized areas. Nothing in the proposed or final rule would precludeStates from addressing this particular concern. Generally, which chemicalsmust be monitored in sludge will be addressed in the technical regulationsunder Part 503. Whether additional pollutants of concern in particularareas should be regularly monitored, however, is best left to the discretionof the States and permit writers. An important element of a State's compliance evaluation efforts is a programto verify the accuracy of self-monitoring reports (andSection; 123.26(b)).EPA received four comments on this subject. Two States, in response tothe 1986 proposal, requested that the requirement for procedures to verifyself-monitoring reports be deleted. In contrast, two citizen groups (onein response to the 1986 proposal and one in response to the 1988 proposal)expressed concern about reliance on self-monitoring, implying that additionalState monitoring should be required instead. As noted by one of the citizengroup commenters, a State monitoring and inspection program is particularlycritical where most monitoring is done by the regulated parties. Therefore,the final rule retains the general requirement for States to have a programto verify self-monitoring reports. States must also be able to determine, independent of self-monitoring reports,the compliance status of regulated parties. In particular, the 1988 proposedrule contained a requirement that States inspect ``all Class I sludge managementfacilities where applicable at least annually'' (andSection; 123.26(e)(1),incorporated by reference in andSection; 501.16). The 1986 proposal recommended,but did not require, annual inspections of Class I sludge management facilities.One commenter on the 1986 proposal specifically endorsed establishing theannual inspection as a requirement. Another commenter on the 1986 proposalhowever, a State, requested that it be allowed to continue inspectionson a two-year cycle because it had limited resources and the facilitieswere widely scattered among a large area. Five commenters, all State agencies,provided comments on the 1988 proposed requirement. The commenters generallysupported annual inspection of Class I sludge management facilities, exceptfor sites where sludge is applied to land. Several commenters assertedthat annual inspection of privately-owned agricultural landspreading sitesused by Class I facilities would be burdensome and proposed instead thatthe frequency of these inspections be left to State discretion, or thatinspections only be required prior to site approval. One commenter assertedthat annual inspections would be impractical (manpower demand would beseasonal, inspections would have to be performed at the time of applicationto have any value, inspectors would have to visit unused fields as permitteesshould be encouraged to have numerous sites available whether or not thesites are used). One commenter requested that EPA clarify what is meantby ``inspection.'' Another one noted that whether annual inspections wouldbe appropriate would depend on the definition of ``Class I'' and ``facility.''After considering these comments, EPA has decided to retain the 1988 proposedlanguage in today's final rule: compliance evaluation programs must includeinspections of ``all Class I sludge management facilities where applicableat least annually.'' EPA did not adopt the suggestion to require inspectionsevery two years rather than annually. While this may require some Statesto devote additional resources to their inspection program, EPA believesthat limiting the annual inspection requirement to ``Class I sludge managementfacilities'' appropriately balances State resource concerns and the needto establish minimum State program requirements that ensure compliancewith Section 405 requirements. EPA encourages States, where possible, tocombine sludge inspections with other inspections, such as pretreatmentinspections, to more efficiently use resources. Although the final rule retains the same language as the proposed rule,it does not require annual inspection of all beneficial reuse land applicationsites. As set forth at andSection; 501.2 in today's rule, the definitionof ``Class I sludge management facility'' has been revised to include anyPOTW meeting the criteria in andSection; 403.8(a) and any other treatmentworks treating domestic sewage classified as such by the Regional Administratorin conjunction with the State Program Director because of its potentialfor adversely affecting public health and the environment. Thus, beneficialreuse land application sites are not themselves Class I management facilitiesby definition, and compliance evaluation programs are not required to inspectall beneficial reuse sites receiving sludge from Class I sludge managementfacilities annually. (Note: The definition of ``facility'' has no significancefor the annual inspection requirement. Also, as discussed elsewhere intoday's preamble, EPA has dropped the definition of ``facility'' from today'srule, primarily because it created too much confusion.) EPA does not address a minimum frequency for inspection of land applicationsites receiving sludge from Class I sludge management facilities in today'srule. Neither does the Agency define ``inspection.'' Instead, the Agencywill address these issues as it has in the NPDES program and prepare complianceevaluation program guidance. Addressing these issues in guidance ratherthan regulation provides both EPA and the States with important flexibilityin responding to particular fact situations and changing program priorities.Similarly, today's final rule does not establish a minimum inspection frequencyfor non-Class I sludge management facilities. One commenter on the 1986proposal asked that States be required to do periodic inspections of non-ClassI facilities. EPA expects that State inspection programs will include non-ClassI facilities, but the appropriate frequency and other details concerningthese inspections will be left to negotiation between the State and EPAin the MOA or other program agreements. The same commenter also requestedthat the regulations require a thorough inspection of each non-Class Ifacility as soon as the sludge technical regulations are promulgated todetermine whether the facility is properly classified as a non-Class Ifacility, since ``Class I designation'' is based in part on evidence ofa pretreatment problem, which in turn may depend on the technical sludgeregulations. EPA disagrees that mandatory inspections of non-Class I facilitiesupon promulgation of the technical standards are necessary for this purpose.Whether a particular treatment works requires a pretreatment program underandSection; 403.8(a) (and hence will be considered a Class I sludge managementfacility under today's rule) is adequately addressed by the pretreatmentregulations at 40 CFR Part 403. Moreover, State inspections are only onemeans of determining compliance. Non-Class I facilities will still be expectedto meet the self-monitoring requirements that apply to all permittees.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Enforcement Authority (Section 501.17) </ITAG><T3>General. </T3>The proposed rule required States to have adequate enforcementauthority in their State statutes, including the ability to enjoin violationsand bring both civil and criminal actions for any violations of permits,the permit program, or the sludge use and disposal standards set forthin 40 CFR Part 503. The March 1988 proposal differed in two respects fromthe February 1986 proposal. First, the March 1988 proposal did not providefor alternative civil penalties, which would allow the Regional Administratorand State Program Director to agree to a lesser civil penalty authorityif sufficient to deter violations. This provision was deleted to minimizeinconsistency among State programs regarding fundamental enforcement authorities.The March 1988 proposal also differed in that it required States to haveauthority to seek criminal fines. This requirement was added because the1987 amendments to Clean Water Act made knowing violation of section 405subject to the criminal penalties of the CWA. Today's final rule is essentially the same as the March 1988 proposed rule.States may, of course, have other enforcement authorities than those requiredby this section, but these would be considered additions to, not substitutesfor, the required enforcement authorities. Similarly, States cannot provideadditional defenses or rights not authorized by federal law. Thus, a Statecould not allow a permittee to challenge its permit limits in an enforcementproceeding, and State law that provided such an option would be inconsistentwith the federal requirements. Similarly, a State could not restrict itsenforcement by limiting the use of information in an enforcement action.States must be able to immediately restrain unauthorized activity whichis endangering or causing damage to public health or the environment. (andSection;501.17(a)(1)). This requirement can be met through authority to issue administrativecease and desist orders or to seek temporary restraining orders in court.(States need not have both authorities as feared by one commenter.) Inresponse to this provision in the 1986 proposa1, one commenter said thatStates should be required to have authority to enjoin authorized as wellas unauthorized activities which are endangering or causing harm to publichealth or the environment. The commenter's suggested revision is unnecessaryfor purposes of ensuring that States have adequate authority to ensurecompliance with section 405 of the CWA and for protecting public healthand the environment. ``Authorized activity'' in this case means sludgeuse or disposal activities undertaken in compliance with sludge permitconditions and the technical requirements promulgated under section 405(d)of the CWA. It is reasonable to assume that authorized activities willnot threaten or cause harm to public health and the environment.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>This required enforcement authority also parallels whatis required of approved NPDES States in andSection; 123.27(a)(1).</ITAG>Consistent with section 405(e), States must be able to enforce againstviolations of the Part 503 technical standards by any person who uses ordisposes of sewage sludge, not just permittees. Thus, the same enforcementauthorities required by this section must be available against non-permitteesas well as permittees. As requested by a commenter, this has been clarifiedin the final rule with minor editorial changes to andSection; 501.17(a)(3).Where a State's program is broader than the Federal program, however, thepenalties that apply to additional coverage would not be considered indetermining the adequacy of the State's program. State penalty authority must allow the State to seek civil penalties inthe amount of at least $5,000 per day of violation. Four States supportedthe $5,000 amount as appropriate to provide adequate enforcement authority.Several commenters opposed the $5,000 because it would be excessive insome situations. Similarly, other commenters said that penalties shouldbe determined at the discretion of the States based on the type and severityof the violation. In contrast, one State said automatic fines imposed uponowners for significant permit violations would help improve public perceptionand confidence in the ability of regulatory agencies to control sludgemanagement activities.These comments reflect a misunderstanding about the required penalty authority.Today's rule does not mandate a minimum $5,000 penalty for all violationsand therefore does not disturb traditional enforcement discretion (includinga policy requiring automatic fines in certain situations). Instead, itrequires the State to have the authority to seek at least up to $5,000per day of violation. Thus, for a particular violation, a State might decidethat $1,000 per day is an appropriate penalty. This would be allowed undertoday's final rule. Section 501.17(a)(3)(i) requires that the State mustbe able to seek at least a $5,000 per day penalty if appropriate to theviolation. Under today's rule, the State must be able to seek injunctive relief intwo instances. First, it must be able to restrain immediately any unauthorizedactivity endangering the public health or the environment. Second, it musthave authority to sue to enjoin any threatened or continuing violationswithout first revoking the permit. States must be able to seek criminal fines (for willful or negligent violations)in the amount of at least $10,000 per day of violation, and seek criminalfines for knowingly making false representations or certifications, orknowingly rendering monitoring devices inaccurate, in at least the amountof $5,000 for each instance of violation. No commenters specifically addressedthe question of criminal fines. Today's required penalty authorities parallel those in the NPDES program.(<T3>See</T3> andSection; 123.27(a)(3)(i); andSection; 123.27(c).) (As notedby one commenter, this means that States which are unable to obtain NPDESapproval because they lack the required penalty authority would be unableto obtain approval of a separate State sludge program.) This does not meanthey are redundant and should be deleted, as suggested by one State. Theywould be redundant only if the State will be regulating sludge throughits existing NPDES program (and the State's enabling statute authorizedpenalties for violations of sludge requirements and permit conditions),in which case the Part 501 regulations would not apply. One commenter specificallyendorsed parity between the penalty authorities required of NPDES and non-NPDESprograms, but argued that the CWA also required parity with EPA's penaltyauthority (although States could leave $10,000 per day civil penaltiesintact). EPA has never interpreted the CWA to require States to have thesame penalty authority as does EPA and therefore disagrees. The U.S. Courtof Appeals for the D.C. Circuit recently upheld EPA's interpretation. <T3>See NRDC</T3> v.<T3> EPA,</T3> 859 F.2d 156, 178, 28 ERC 1401, 1420 (D.C. Cir. 1988). One commenter stated that it is inappropriate for one government agencyto fine another government agency resulting in ``the people'' fining themselves.Instead, States should be able to rely on other enforcement measures toachieve compliance by other government agencies. Apparently, the commenter,a POTW, objects to requiring States to be able to seek penalties againstPOTWs. Conversely, another commenter recounted a situation where a Stateallegedly failed to seek fines against a POTW despite six years of non-compliance.This commenter asked that the regulations require States to seek finesagainst POTWs in this situation and also against the industrial users ofthe POTW that are the source of the problem. Under the Clean Water Act,POTWs are treated the same as other regulated parties with regard to penalties.State programs likewise should be required to treat POTWs the same as otherregulated parties. Fines may also be necessary to bring POTWs into compliance.However, as discussed above, EPA does not intend to dictate in the regulationshow States should exercise enforcement discretion. EPA will oversee theState's enforcement program and may, in particular cases where it believesthe State's enforcement response to be inadequate, file its own enforcementaction in accordance with the CWA and the MOA. EPA noted in the preamble to the proposed rule that the minimum penaltyceiling required of approved State programs may be raised for the NPDESprogram and that similar increases would follow in Part 501. To date, theAgency has taken no action to raise the minimum penalty ceiling. Therefore,any such increase will be addressed in a future rulemaking. Any State programapproved under this Part before the minimum ceilings are raised would begiven sufficient time to enact new legislation (i.e., up to two years).One State asked that EPA provide guidance and develop specific standardsand criteria for assessing fines based on the nature and severity of theviolation. In particular, the State noted a problem with seeking finesin the absence of a documented water quality impact. EPA is in the processof examining what guidance will be needed as the sludge program moves intoa more active implementation phase. Enforcement guidance is a likely candidate.However, it is important to emphasize that the environmental effects ofconcern to the sludge program as established in the CWA and these regulationsgoes beyond water quality impacts. Therefore, whether or not to seek finesfor a particular violation should not depend solely upon a documented waterquality impact. EPA would consider such a narrow approach inadequate.<T3>Public participation in enforcement (andSection; 501.17(d)). </T3>EPAproposed to require State programs to provide for public participationin the enforcement process. Proposed andSection; 501.17(d) would allow Statesto choose from two options. The first option is for State law to providefor intervention as of right in any enforcement action (andSection; 501.17(d)(1)).States choosing this option may not place restrictions on this right. Alternatively,where State laws allow permissive intervention in State civil or administrativeactions, the State could agree not to oppose such intervention in any enforcementproceeding. Under this option, the State would also have to agree to investigateand respond to citizen complaints and publish all settlement agreementsfor a public comment period of at least 30 days (andSection; 501.17(d)(2)).EPA received only one response to this section, from a State which raisedseveral concerns. First, the commenter suggested that the right to interveneunder andSection; 501.17(d)(1) should be limited to adjacent property owners,municipalities, and counties in the case of land application, i.e., requirea demonstration of standing before intervention is allowed. EPA does notobject to the general concept of limiting intervention to those who havestanding, but only when standing is broadly defined, i.e., that which isallowed under Article III of the U.S. Constitution. This intent is reflectedin the phrase ``any citizen having an interest which is or may be adverselyaffected.'' State statutory limits on standing that are narrower than suchConstitutional privileges are insufficient for purposes of andSection; 501.17(d)(1).(See 45 FR 33383, May 19, 1980, which discusses the NPDES provision onwhich andSection; 501.17(d) is based.) With regard to andSection; 501.17(d)(2) (the second option), the same commenterquestioned whether telephone responses would be an adequate substitutefor written responses as a means to reduce the burden of responding toall complaints. That section requires a State to provide assurance thatit will ``investigate and provide written responses to all citizen complaintssubmitted pursuant to procedures specified in andSection; 123.26(b)(4).''This referenced section requires all States, as part of a compliance monitoringand evaluation program, to have ``procedures for receiving and <T3>ensuring proper consideration </T3>of information submitted by thepublic about violations'' (emphasis added). Read together, these sectionsdo not seem to require written responses in all cases, but would allowStates to respond by telephone when the complaint clearly does not warranta more extensive response, e.g., a phone request asking whether a particularfacility has obtained a required permit. However, the State should haveprocedures and guidelines for determining the appropriate level and typeof response to various types of complaints of violations, which EPA wouldconsider in determining whether the requirements of andSection; 501.17(d)(2)(i)are met. Finally, the commenter said that providing a 30 day comment period on anyenforcement action would unnecessarily delay the enforcement process andcould allow environmental damage to continue during the comment period.Section 501.17(d)(2)(iii) would require notice only for proposed settlementactions, not for the resolution of all enforcement actions. Therefore,the 30-day comment period should not interfere with seeking immediate injunctiverelief to abate an immediate threat to public health or the environment.Similarly, the requirement does not apply to enforcement actions not requiredas a part of an approved State program, e.g., actions to recover damagesto natural resources. In other cases brought for violations of the program,the potential for accumulating substantial penalties should provide violatorswith sufficient incentive to cease violation and thus prevent further harmto public health or the environment. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Sharing of information between States and EPA (Sections 501.19and 501.20)  </ITAG>Section 501.19 incorporates 40 CFR 123.41, which requires that the Statemake available to EPA upon request, any information obtained or used inthe administration of a State program. (A similar provision appeared inthe 1986 proposal as a requirement for the MOA.) This section also providesprocedures for the sharing of information, allows EPA to make any nonconfidentialinformation available to the public, and also requires EPA to furnish tothe State nonconfidential information in its files which the State needsto implement the approved program. Two commenters on the 1986 proposalobjected to a similar requirement for EPA access to State records. As notedin the discussion about the State/EPA MOA, EPA disagrees with the commentersthat EPA access to State records is unnecessary and redundant. Therefore,this section remains unchanged in the final rule. Section 501.20 incorporates andSection; 123.42, which addresses the transferof relevant information collected by EPA to the State agency upon programapproval. Under that section, the MOA between the State and the RegionalAdministrator must provide for: (1) Transfer of all copies of pending permitapplications and other relevant information to the State, and (2) proceduresto ensure that the State Director will not issue a permit on the basisof any application received from the Regional Administrator which the RegionalAdministrator has identified as incomplete until the Director receivesinformation sufficient to correct the deficiency. In the absence of significantcomments, this section too remains unchanged in the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">10. Program reporting to EPA (Section 501.21)  </ITAG>This section contains the requirements for semi-annual and annual reportsto be submitted to EPA. These reports are important for tracking the Stateprogram and evaluating compliance monitoring and enforcement performance.The 1986 proposal required the States to submit quarterly reports on ``substantial''noncompliance of Class I facilities. In addition, annual reports containinginventory updates, lists of ``substantial'' noncompliance by Class I facilities,and summaries of instances of ``substantial'' noncompliance by non-ClassI facilities were required. The 1988 proposal incorporated two changes.First, substantial noncompliance was no longer defined as ``noncompliancewhich may adversely affect public health and the environment,'' and second,the States were no longer required to report the ``unexplained presenceof elevated levels of toxic or hazardous substance(s) in a facility's sewagesludge.'' EPA deleted the above annual reporting requirements in responseto comments that these requirements were too general, would unnecessarilyduplicate the requirement to report significant noncompliance with thePart 503 technical standards, and would encompass virtually all noncompliance.Today's final rule is basically the same as the March 9, 1988 proposedrule. The annual reporting requirements remain unchanged. However, thefinal rule does include major and minor changes to the quarterly reportingrequirements in response to comments. Also, in the final rule the term``substantial compliance,'' which was used in both the 1986 and 1988 proposals,was changed to ``noncompliance.'' The word ``substantial'' was deletedas unnecessary and to avoid potential confusion with the NPDES term ``significant.''Thus, the semi-annual and annual reporting requirements in andSection; 501.21which previously read ``substantial noncompliance'' now read ``noncompliance.''The change in terminology does not affect the types of ``noncompliance''that must be reported in andSection; 501.21(a)(1), as described below. Sixteen individuals commented on the February 4, 1986 proposed rule andnine commenters provided comments on the March 9, 1988 proposed rule. Almostall comments were received from the States. Thirteen States commented onthe 1986 proposal and eight States commented on the 1988 reproposal. Inaddition, two POTWs/municipalities and one environmental group commentedon the 1986 proposal and one POTW/municipality commented on the 1988 proposal.The two major issues most commenters focused on were: (1) The frequencyof State reporting; and (2) the content of the semi-annual and annual reports.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>See discussion below regarding the change from quarterlyto semi-annual reports. Comments addressing the promulgation of the Part503 technical standards are addressed above in the discussion on timing.</ITAG><T3>Semi-annual reports. </T3>Section 501.21(a) details the incidents ofnoncompliance by Class I sludge management facilities which shall be reportedin the Semi-annual Sludge Violation Reports.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Much of the information for semi-annual reporting is basedon permittee self-monitoring reports now required.</ITAG>These reports provide EPA with permittee information identifying the noncomplyingfacility and other information such as the date and type of noncomplianceand actions taken to achieve compliance. In addition, instances of significantfailure to comply with Part 503 standards and permit conditions, failureto complete construction of essential elements of a sludge facility (asprovided in a compliance schedule or as otherwise necessary to meet permitand/or Part 503 standards), and failure to provide adequate monitoringor other reports, are also required to be reported in the semi-annual reports.The majority of commenters strongly opposed quarterly reports. Commentersobjected that they are overly restrictive, unnecessary and divert resourcesfrom active sludge management. Several States commented that they wouldnot have the resources to produce the required reports. Two commentersnoted that quarterly reports are more appropriate for continuous dischargesthan for intermittent sludge discharges and that annual reports would beadequate. Several commenters also questioned the utility of quarterly reports.After reviewing this requirement, EPA agrees that requiring reports ona quarterly basis does not sufficiently add to EPA oversight at this timeto justify the additional costs of these reports. Instead, EPA has decidedthat semi-annual reports (as suggested by one commenter) will reduce reportingrequirements and provide sufficient information to adequately track theState program and evaluate compliance and enforcement.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>All references to quarterly reports in the rest of thisdiscussion should be read to mean the semi-annual reports now required.</ITAG>One commenter suggested that the contents of quarterly reports be leftup to the discretion of the State Director. Providing for this type ofdiscretion would not ensure the uniform reporting necessary for effectiveenforcement and oversight. Conversely, an environmental group commentedthat the quarterly reports should contain the same information requiredin the annual reports. EPA disagrees that the information not includedin the quarterly reports is necessary for program oversight. Annual reportingis sufficient for enforcement and State program oversight. Several commenters suggested that quarterly reports be replaced by allowingthe State to notify EPA of instances of substantial noncompliance as theyoccur rather than on a regular schedule. One of these commenters remarkedthat reporting only violations as they occurred would bring more EPA attentionto instances of noncompliance than would inclusion of these violationsin monthly, quarterly or annual reports. While this idea has weight, reportingnoncompliance as it occurs will not significantly increase EPA's enforcementor oversight ability. A semi-annual report will minimize the resource drainon the States and will be sufficient to allow EPA to target problem facilitiesor problems with the State's enforcement program. <T3>Annual reports. </T3>Section 501.21(b) describes the annual reportwhich provides EPA with information necessary to evaluate permittee noncomplianceand assess State Programs. EPA intends the focus of the annual report tobe on significant noncompliance. The annual reports shall contain the informationrequired in the semi-annual reports, and information to update the inventoryof sewage sludge generators and disposers submitted with the program planor previous annual reports, as well as specific and summary informationon noncomplying Class I and non-Class I facilities.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Comments and other issues concerning inventory requirementsare addressed in the program description section.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In addition, as a component of program oversight, EPA is also requiringa summary of the results of State compliance monitoring efforts to verifyself-monitoring reports in the annual report. Two commenters found the annual reporting requirements restrictive andunnecessary. One commenter asked EPA to reduce these requirements. Annualreports update inventories, describe program changes, and summarize instancesof substantial noncompliance by non-Class I facilities. This informationis not covered by semi-annual reports and is necessary for program review.Another commenter stated that the information required in annual reportsis supplied in other required reports. EPA has not required this informationon a routine basis (although portions of the inventory requirement mayhave been requested as part of the State's work plans). A number of commenters asked that EPA define in detail several terms usedin the semi-annual and annual reporting requirements of the 1986 proposal.In particular, determining noncompliance was problematic for many commenters.Several commenters suggested that EPA clearly define ``significant failureto comply.'' The accompanying Part 503 regulation will provide minimumfederal requirements for sludge use and disposal. When a violation of thesestandards would be considered ``significant'' for purposes of State reportingto EPA is not defined in today's rule. Instead, this will be addressedin guidance and may, in the future, be codified. Where adequate clarificationof other terms has not been provided in the final rule, the Part 503 regulationor guidance will provide additional details. The types of noncompliancewhich must be reported are detailed in andSection; 501.21(a)(1) (i) through(v).As requested by one commenter, the final rule no longer provides that ``TheState Program Director and Regional Administrator may choose to includereporting incidents of substantial noncompliance by additional non-ClassI facilities at their discretion.'' EPA agrees that because this sentencedescribes an optional provision and not a minimum requirement, includingit in the regulation is unnecessary. Of course, the State Director andRegional Administrator are free to agree on additional reporting not specificallyrequired by the regulation. As with other details about program administrationnot addressed in detail in the regulation, EPA expects that the State Directorand Regional Administrator will reach agreement on these activities inthe MOA and other program agreements. An environmental group stated that reporting should be required for allnoncompliance, not just for ``substantial'' noncompliance. Limited resourcesrequire that EPA target the most critical problems. The primary purposeof State reporting to EPA is for general program oversight. While EPA mayuse this information as the basis for its decisions on enforcement actions,States are not simply acting as information collection agents for EPA.The administration of a State program is primarily the State's responsibility.Therefore, reports on ``substantial'' noncompliance are sufficient forthe purposes of andSection; 501.21. Of course, more detailed informationabout any instance of noncompliance (whether by a Class I or non-ClassI sludge management facility) would be available to EPA and, in the caseof permittee self-monitoring reports required by the permit, to the public.Similarly, another commenter stated that reporting for non-Class I noncomplianceshould be the same for Class I noncompliance. The types of noncompliancethat must be reported are the same for each class of permittee. What differsis the frequency of reporting. Two comments addressed discrepancies with or replication of NPDES reportingrequirements. One commenter questioned whether andSection; 501.21(b)(4) iswarranted since it requires more specific permittee information than andSection;123.45(c) does for NPDES minors. EPA also received a conflicting commentstating that the reporting requirements as proposed duplicate NPDES requirements.EPA has expanded the reporting requirements for non-Class I facilitiesbecause there are only a small number of Class I facilities, and the noncomplyingnon-Class I facilities can realistically be classified as Class I facilitieswhich need similar attention. Several commenters requested that EPA develop a computer software programto promote reporting uniformity and minimize duplication of effort. Anothercommenter suggested that EPA develop a standardized reporting format (suchas questionnaires, tables, and checklists) for the same reasons. EPA isin the process of developing an information system which will assist theStates in fulfilling these reporting requirements. However, such a systemcannot replace formal reporting as has been suggested by one commenterbecause a narrative response is required in some cases (e.g., andSection;501.21(b)(4)(i)(D) requires States to describe steps being taken to bringnoncomplying non-Class I facilities into compliance). Finally, several commenters suggested that EPA use existing programs, suchas the section 305(b) reports for State program oversight, or randomlysample existing State programs to evaluate compliance. Section 305(b) requiresbiannual reports to Congress which were not intended for this purpose.Other suggested alternatives to program reporting do not provide the levelof detail EPA requires for compliance evaluation and enforcement. <ITAG tagnum="81">11. Program Approval, Revision, and Withdrawal (Sections 501.31 through501.34) </ITAG><T3>Review and approval procedures. </T3>Section 501.31 outlines the proceduresfor State submission and EPA review and approval of a State program thatapply after EPA makes a determination under andSection; 501.11(b) that theState's submission is complete. Once the program is determined to be complete, EPA must provide publicnotice of receipt of the submission. As noted by a commenter on the 1986proposal, notice that EPA will be considering the State's application forprogram approval is an important step because it informs the public aboutits opportunity to comment on the State's application. The notice mustindicate where and when the State's submission is accessible to the publicand the cost of obtaining a copy. It also delineates the fundamental aspectsof the State's proposed program and must provide a minimum comment periodof 45 days. Finally, the notice must state whether a public hearing hasbeen scheduled (or how one can be requested, if none has been scheduled)and list the name of a contact person who can provide additional information.Under the proposed rule, EPA would publish the notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, in enough of the largest newspapers in the Stateto attract State-wide attention, and in individual notices mailed to allinterested persons and government agencies, as well as to all permit holdersand applicants subject to sludge use and disposal requirements. The Agencysolicited comments on whether individual notice to ``permit holders andapplicants'' was necessary or whether the other required forms of notice(<T4>Federal Register</T4>, State newspapers, and mailing lists) would besufficient. Comments on this issue were evenly divided. Individual notice receivedbroad-based support (a State, an environmental group, a POTW, and an associationrepresenting POTWs), primarily because it would better inform the regulatedcommunity and give them opportunity to comment. Opponents included fiveStates and one industry. In opposition, commenters said that money couldbe better spent on research, regulated parties will be subject to the samestandards regardless of who issues the permits, and notice would only confusethe regulated community. EPA has carefully considered all comments and has decided in the finalrule to require individual notice to regulated parties (in addition topersons on the general mailing list of interested persons). It is importantthat the regulated community and other interested parties have notice andopportunity to comment on the State's program, particularly since the sludgemanagement program is new. This can best be accomplished with widespreadnotice of the State's submission. The State's program could be administereddifferently from the federal program even though the federal technicalstandards will be a key feature in both programs. Likewise, the State couldbe reorganizing its sludge management functions or program offices as partof a plan to obtain EPA approval. Therefore, it is difficult to understandhow notice would confuse the regulated community. Instead, such notice(and subsequent information activities) could help clarify critical aspectsof the program's administration. One commenter requested that State permit programs be sent to all permitholders whenever ``sludge management programs'' are included in an NPDESpermit. This is neither feasible nor necessary. As discussed above, regulatedparties will receive individual notice that EPA is considering a Stateprogram for approval and will have 45 days to comment on the State's submission(increased from 30 days in response to comments on the 1986 proposal andconsistent with the NPDES regulations). Regulated parties will have sufficientopportunity to review and comment on the State program when EPA is makingthe approval decision. After State program approval, permit applicantswill of course have an opportunity to comment during the permit issuanceprocess on any State permit proposed to be issued. (See andSection; 501.15(d).)The final rule differs slightly from the proposed rule in that it requiresindividual notice to ``all treatment works treating domestic sewage listedon the inventory required by andSection; 501.12(f)'' rather than to ``permitholders and applicants.'' The change serves two purposes. First, it moreclearly defines the category of persons who are to be sent the notice anddistinguishes this category from NPDES permit holders and applicants. Second,using the inventory of potential permittees, which the State must submitas part of its program application, minimizes the resources needed to compilethe mailing list. This addresses concerns raised by some commenters aboutthe potential burden of the notice requirements. It should also help ensurethat notice will be sent to those facilities most likely to be immediatelyaffected by State program approval. (In this regard, it should be notedthat requiring individual notice for ``all treatment works treating domesticsewage * * *'' is intended to be a general target. In other words, failureto notify <T3>all </T3>treatment works (e.g., those not on the initial inventory)would not provide a legal basis for challenging EPA's approval of a Stateprogram.) The proposed rule also would have required that the public notice ``providefor a public hearing within the State to be held no less than 30 days afterthe notice is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>'' (andSection; 501.31(b)(2) of the 1988 proposal).EPA solicited comments on this aspect of the approval procedures as well,particularly whether a public hearing on EPA's approval of the State programshould be mandatory (as in the 1988 proposal) or whether it should be requiredonly when public interest is demonstrated (as in the 1986 proposal). Only two commenters, both regulated parties, supported mandatory publichearings; one without explanation, the other as a means to inform the regulatedcommunity and provide opportunity to comment. Six commenters supporteddiscretionary hearings, with various suggestions for when a hearing shouldbe required. Most said that hearings should be held when there was ``significant''or ``demonstrated'' public interest. One commenter said a hearing shouldbe held if there is a single request. EPA agrees with the commenters opposing automatic, mandatory public hearingson State program approval. Under the final rule, a public hearing willbe held ``whenever the Regional Administrator finds, on the basis of requests,a significant degree of public interest in the State's application or thata public hearing might clarify one or more issues involved in the State'sapplication.'' andSection; 501.31(c)(2). Providing for public hearings onlywhen there is sufficient public interest or other useful reason for holdinga hearing efficiently uses resources without sacrificing public participation.EPA strongly encourages public hearings whenever public interest has beenshown. However, it does not agree that automatic triggers, such as thesingle request suggested by one commenter, are needed to ensure adequatepublic participation. It is more appropriate to give Regional Administratorsflexibility to exercise judgment in this regard. One commenter who responded to the 1986 proposal said that the RegionalAdministrator should not hold any public hearings on the State's applicationsince the State could hold any necessary hearing and EPA could participatein the State hearing if it wished. EPA disagrees. The decision whetheror not to approve a State program rests with EPA and, as the decision-maker,EPA should also determine whether a public hearing is necessary. As discussed above, the State's application will be widely noticed, includingindividual notice to a large segment of the regulated community. Thus,both the public and the regulated community will have ample notice andopportunity to request a hearing. If a hearing has not already be scheduledat the time of the notice required by paragraph (c)(2), that notice willinclude information about how to request a public hearing. If the RegionalAdministrator subsequently decides to hold a hearing, notice of the hearingmust appear in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at least 30 days before the scheduled date ofthe hearing, which states when and where the hearing will be held.One commenter on the earlier proposal said the regulation should specifythat the hearing be held ``at a location selected by the State submittinga program'' to ensure that State concerns are heard and to satisfy theintent of public hearings. EPA disagrees that further specificity in theregulation is necessary or desirable. States have ample opportunity tovoice their concerns before, during, and after the public hearings. Theregulation already specifies that the public hearing will be held ``withinthe State.'' Under general principles, decisions such as where to holdhearings are guided by the goal of maximizing public participation andthus satisfying the intent of public hearings. (See, for example, 40 CFR25.12(c).) Although ensuring the State's opportunity to participate ina hearing would be of paramount importance, the Regional Administratormust also consider the convenience of the hearing location to other partieswho have expressed an interest. Therefore, the details of the public hearing,including location, are best left to the discretion of the Regional Administrator.The Administrator has 90 days from the date of receipt of the completeprogram to approve or disapprove of the program. (andSection; 501.31(d).)In response to a comment, today's final rule clarifies that the 90-dayreview period begins only after EPA has determined that the program iscomplete (in accordance with andSection; 501.11(b)). As a general rule, 90days should be sufficient time to make this decision. Failure to make adecision by the 90-day deadline does not mean that the State's programis approved by default, however. Also, the 90-day period may be extendedby mutual agreement between the State and EPA. One commenter objected toproviding for an extension of the deadline without also publishing noticeof, and reasons for, the extension and providing for public notice andopportunity to comment. The same commenter also objected to any extensionof the comment period based on ``material changes'' to the State programsubmission. According to the commenter, extensions of the 90-day reviewperiod unnecessarily delay action on the State's program. EPA disagrees.Flexibility is needed to provide EPA with adequate time to consider changesto the State's submission made by the State or in response to problemsidentified during public review. In most cases, providing for extensionsof the review period to accommodate ``mid-stream'' changes would be lesstime-consuming than either of the alternatives: disapproving a programat the end of the 90-day period and starting the process over again toreview the changes or approving the program and considering changes throughprogram revision procedures. Moreover, now that the CWA clearly authorizesa federal permitting program, delay in approving a State program does notnecessarily delay implementation of environmental controls. In addition,EPA sees no useful reason to subject this type of interlocutory proceduraldecision to notice and comment. Extensions of the review periods do notdiminish the public's opportunity to comment on the adequacy of the State'sprogram. The Regional Office will prepare a responsiveness summary identifying thepublic participation activities conducted, summarizing significant commentsand responding to these comments. Notice of approval will be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. If the program is disapproved, the Administratorwill notify the State of the reasons for disapproval and what final revisionswould be necessary to make the program approvable. One commenter suggestedthat EPA publish a notice of disapproval as well, to inform the publicof final agency action. Since the effect of disapproval would be to maintainthe status quo, it is not clear what purpose such a notice would serve.Therefore, the final rule has not been revised to require notice of disapproval.One commenter said the use of different terms to designate the authorityresponsible for approving State programs, such as ``EPA,'' ``Administrator,''``Agency,'' and ``Regional Offices'' in this section was confusing. Thiscommenter also suggested that such decisions be made at the Regional level``after obtaining concurrence on a case-by-case basis from headquartersbased on a national flexible program emphasis.'' In a related vein, a commenteron the 1986 proposal urged generally that Regional Administrators be givengreater control over State program approval decisions because the RegionalAdministrator is in a better position than EPA in Washington to determineif a State program provides adequate control over sewage sludge. The language in this section is taken from an analogous section in Part123, the NPDES State program regulations. The use of different terms reflectsthe involvement of both Headquarters and the Regional Office in State programapproval decisions. Details about approval procedures are provided in additionalguidance. Briefly, the Administrator or his designee is the final decision-makingauthority. However, the Regional Office plays the lead role in workingwith the State to develop an appropriate program and in processing theState's application, and in recommending final decisions. The Region'srole will be established through an internal delegation of authority documentrather than in the regulation. Headquarters concurs on major decisions.Although Regional Offices are more familiar with particular State programs,EPA Headquarters' involvement ensures minimum consistency among State programsnationwide. Therefore, the final rule retains essentially the same languageas the proposed. Two minor changes have been made to clarify any remaining confusion. First,the words ``the Agency's'' have been replaced by ``EPA's'' in the lastsentence of andSection; 501.31(d). Second, a definition of ``Administrator''has been added to andSection; 501.2, which includes ``an authorized representative''of the Administrator as part of the definition (consistent with the definitionof ``Administrator'' in Part 122). <T3>Program revision. </T3>Section 501.32 addresses revision of State programs.The procedures for program revision are very similar to the proceduresused in the original program approval process (and therefore, except incases of nonsubstantial revisions, provide for public participation asrequested by a commenter on the 1986 proposal). The revision proceduresin the proposed rule were based on analogous provisions in Part 123. EPAreceived no significant comment on the proposal and therefore is promulgatinga final rule that is the same as the proposed rule. Revision may be necessary any time the State or Federal laws or programschange. Under paragraph (a), State program revisions necessitated by changesor additions to the Federal regulations governing sewage sludge use anddisposal, including changes to this Part, must be made within one yearfrom promulgation of the applicable regulations, or within two years ifan amendment to a State statute is required. <T3>Program withdrawal. </T3>Sections 501.33 (criteria for withdrawal)and 501.34 (procedures for withdrawal of State programs) incorporate 40CFR 123.63 and 123.64, the NPDES provisions for program withdrawal. Thefinal rule is the same as the March 1988 proposed rule. Under these sections, withdrawal can occur voluntarily (where the Statedecides to transfer all program responsibilities back to EPA) or involuntarily(EPA decides to withdraw approval where the State program no longer complieswith the Clean Water Act or regulations). The rule does not provide forpartial withdrawal of a State's program (as would the 1986 proposed Part501) because it would result in a piecemeal program that would be difficultto administer and oversee and could create considerable confusion. Groundsfor initiating State program withdrawal proceedings include: (1) The State'slegal authorities no longer meet CWA requirements; (2) the operation ofthe State program fails to comply with EPA regulations; (3) the State'senforcement program fails to comply with EPA regulations; or (4) the Stateprogram fails to comply with the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement.One commenter addressed the program withdrawal criteria provision in responseto the 1986 proposal (which was substantially the same as the 1988 proposal).The commenter requested that criteria for withdrawal that is based on enforcementprogram performance (see andSection; 123.63(a)(3)(ii)) be revised to read:``Failure to seek adequate enforcement penalties or fines or to collectsuch penalties or fines,'' rather than ``Failure to seek adequate enforcementpenalties or to collect administrative fines when imposed.''The commenter did not give a reason for requesting the change in language.The final rule does not adopt the suggested change. The criteria do notaddress collection of judicially imposed penalties because, unlike administrativefines, the approved State agency may have little, if any, control overcollection of those penalties. It would be ineffective to hold a Stateprogram accountable for an activity which they cannot control and thereforeremedy any deficiencies. The commenter also objected to a requirement that program withdrawal occurfor ``major or significant'' failings of the State, and argued that anyfailing that is not purely <T3>de minimis </T3>means the State is no longer entitled to program approvaland EPA must withdraw the program. The specific provision to which thecommenter objected was not in the 1988 proposal and is not in the finalrule. However, it is important to note that, as is the case under the NPDESprogram, EPA considers withdrawal of an approved State sludge managementprogram a drastic remedy that should be invoked only where a State is unableor fails to take corrective action to solve State program deficiencies.<T3>See also Save the Bay, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Administrator, </T3>556 F.2d 1282 (5th Cir. 1977). Another commenter, in response to the 1986 proposal, addressed programwithdrawal procedures. The commenter requested that the regulation specifythat any public hearings on the question of withdrawal take place ``ata location selected by the State submitting the program.'' As discussedabove, the commenter made the same request with regard to program approvalhearings. The procedures governing program withdrawal are those set outin the NPDES State program regulation at andSection; 123.64. Although thoseprocedures do not specify where the hearings must be held, they includewell-established procedural safeguards and provide adequate opportunityfor the State to present its position. Therefore, EPA has not adopted thesuggested change in the final rule. J. Part 123: NPDES State Sludge Management Programs <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General  </ITAG>Part 123 establishes the program requirements and approval procedures forStates which seek EPA approval to administer an NPDES permit program pursuantto section 402 of the CWA in lieu of the federal NPDES permit program.All 39 States which currently have EPA-approved NPDES programs govern,at a minimum, the discharge of pollutants to waters of the United States,including the discharge of sewage sludge to waters of the United States(see sections 405(a)-(c) of the CWA). None of these State programs, however,have been approved by EPA to administer a program which meets the requirementsof sections 405(d) and (f) of the CWA for the safe use and disposal ofsewage sludge (where sludge is not discharged to navigable waters). In the 1987 amendments to the CWA, Congress directed the Administratorof EPA to promulgate procedures for the approval of State programs thatassure compliance with section 405(d) of the CWA and also identified section402 permits as appropriate vehicles for implementing section 405(d) requirements.Section 405(f). To accommodate both goals, EPA proposed to amend Part 123to allow States to incorporate a sludge management program as part of theirapproved NPDES programs. Today's revisions to Part 123 are designed to``fill in the gaps'' of existing NPDES requirements by adding requirementswhich are specific to sludge management programs. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Specific Revisions </ITAG>Today's revisions to Part 123 apply only to those States which choose touse their NPDES program for administering an EPA-approved sludge managementprogram. States with existing NPDES programs will not be required to obtainapproval of a sludge management program in order to maintain approval oftheir NPDES program. Instead, sludge management programs are optional.Moreover, existing NPDES States may choose to implement an approved sludgeprogram through an existing non-NPDES program pursuant to Part 501. Section123.1(c) states the availability of these options. The limited applicability of today's revisions to Part 123 addressing sludgemanagement programs is also addressed in the introductory paragraph toandSection; 123.25(a), which lists permitting requirements in Parts 122 and124 applicable to the federal NPDES program, which a State must also beable to implement as part of an approved NPDES program. Today's final ruleclarifies that a State which chooses not to seek approval of a sludge managementprogram as part of its NPDES program is not required to have authorityto implement the sludge-related revisions to those provisions of Parts122 and 124 listed in andSection; 123.25(a) which are promulgated after enactmentof the 1987 amendments to the CWA. However, States that use their NPDESprograms to administer an approved sludge program would have to be ableto implement these revisions. <T3>Program description. </T3>To obtain NPDES approval, States must submita comprehensive description of the program they propose to administer inlieu of the federal program (andSection; 123.22). For States which seek approvalof their sludge management program as part of an NPDES program, EPA proposedto revise andSection; 123.22 to include three additional requirements: (1)An inventory of all POTWs and other treatment works treating domestic sewage,together with a plan for completing and maintaining an inventory of allsewage sludge generators and disposal facilities; (2) identification ofany program for regulating the disposal of septage and portable toiletpumpings handled under a program that is separate from that for sewagesludge; and (3) a description of any bans or prohibitions imposed by Stateor local authorities on specific sludge management practices. The additional requirements for the program description in today's finalrule differs significantly from the proposed rule. The differences parallelthose made in andSection; 501.12 and are explained in more detail in theabove discussion of Part 501. Briefly, the inventory requirement has beenrevised by providing more specific information on which facilities andinformation must be included as part of the initial program submissionand establishing deadlines for submitting any remaining information. Theidentification of a separate program governing disposal of septage andportable toilet pumpings has been deleted as redundant, and the requirementto document separately all State or local bans or prohibitions on particularsludge management practices has been dropped as not essential.<T3>Compliance evaluation program. </T3>The program description also mustdescribe the State's compliance evaluation program (andSection; 123.22(e)).Section 123.26 establishes the minimum requirements for State compliancemonitoring programs. EPA proposed two revisions to andSection; l23.26(e)for sludge management programs: (1) Specifying in paragraph (e)(1) thatthe inventory of all sources covered by NPDES must include permits whichimplement section 405(f) of the CWA to ensure inclusion of nondischargingsludge treatment works; and (2) a requirement that the annual inspectionin paragraph (e)(5) include all Class I sludge management facilities inaddition to all major dischargers. Today's final rule does not includethe revision to the inventory of sources requirement in andSection; 123.26(e)(1).The proposed revision was unnecessary since two other revisions alreadyrequired the same information. As discussed elsewhere, under revisionsto andSection;andSection; 123.22 and 123.45, States must submit and regularlyupdate an inventory of sludge facilities. This inventory will serve asthe basis for the State's compliance monitoring and tracking program. EPA is promulgating a final rule requiring annual inspections of ClassI facilities that is the same as the proposed rule (andSection; 123.26(e)(5)).EPA received substantive comments on this provision regarding the scopeof inspection requirements, which are addressed in the above discussionabout the parallel provision in Part 501. In addition, one commenter askedfor clarification of the words ``where applicable'' in the annual inspectionprovision. The phrase ``where applicable'' clarifies that States with NPDESprograms that choose to set up separate State sludge management programs(or choose not to have an approved sludge management program) do not needto inspect Class I sludge management facilities as part of their NPDESprogram. <T3>Memorandum of Agreement. </T3>The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) betweenthe State Director and the Regional Administrator must describe which classesand categories of permits the Regional Administrator will review beforeissuance by the State and those for which the Regional Administrator willwaive review. Section 123.24(d) lists the classes and categories of permitsfor which review cannot be waived. Today, EPA is revising this paragraphto add to this list the category of Class I sludge management facilities(as defined in andSection; 501.2). Under today's rule, permits issued tothese treatment works must be submitted to EPA for review and comment,and, where appropriate, objection. EPA's reasons for this requirement andresponse to comments on the proposed rule are discussed above in sectionV.H.1. In related revisions, EPA proposed to amend andSection; 123.44, which governsEPA review of and objections to State permits, in two instances to reflectthe broadened scope of the NPDES program to include regulation of sludgeuse and disposal. Both revisions concern the grounds upon which a RegionalAdministrator may object to a State-issued permit. The first proposed revisionwas to andSection; 123.44(c)(5), which addresses the adequacy of monitoringand related requirements in permits. It added ``standards for sewage sludgeuse and disposal'' as a requirement of the CWA for which monitoring requirementsmust adequately assure compliance, or else be subject to objection by theRegional Administrator. Similarly, andSection; 123.44(c)(6) was proposedto be revised to add ``standards for sewage sludge use or disposal'' and``sewage sludge use or disposal requirements developed on a case-by-casebasis pursuant to section 405(d) of CWA'' as benchmarks against which theRegional Administrator will evaluate State-issued permits. Today's finalrule is the same as that proposed. EPA received one comment objecting tothe revision to andSection; 123.44(c)(6) regarding case-by-case limits, whichis addressed above in section V.I.5. The MOA also must contain provisions specifying reports and informationthe State is expected to submit to EPA (andSection; 123.24(b)(3)). Programreporting requirements are listed, in part, in andSection; 123.45, whichspecifies requirements for noncompliance reporting. EPA proposed to amendandSection; 123.45 by adding a new paragraph (e), which would require a Stateto submit reports on noncompliance with sludge requirements as specifiedin andSection; 501.21, i.e., semi-annual reports summarizing instances ofsignificant noncompliance and annual reports. The proposal also specifiedthat the sludge noncompliance reports may be combined with the reportscurrently required under andSection; 123.45. Today's final rule with regard to noncompliance reporting is the same asthe proposed rule. EPA did, however, make changes to andSection; 501.21,the section which is incorporated by reference in today's final rule. Thosechanges are explained above in section V.I.10. <T3>Incorporating sludge management into existing NPDES programs. </T3>Stateswhich are approved for NPDES already have in place many of the programrequirements that will be required of States which seek approval underPart 501. Consequently, NPDES States need only seek modification of theirexisting programs under andSection; 123.62 if they wish to implement thesludge program through their existing NPDES programs rather than submitentirely new programs. Typically, EPA expects that a program modificationto incorporate sludge would require a State to submit an updated programdescription (including the information about sludge management activitiesdiscussed above), an addendum to the Attorney General's Statement and,where necessary, revisions to the Memorandum of Agreement. NPDES Stateswould need to demonstrate that legal authority exists to issue NPDES permitsfor sludge use and disposal where there is no discharge of the sludge tosurface waters, and that they have the additional authority to implementthe Part 503 technical regulations. (See andSection; 501.1.) Existing Stateregulatory and statutory provisions regarding inspection, monitoring, reportingand enforcement must be broad enough to include section 405 implementation.In addition, States would be expected to make any revisions to their legalauthority necessary to implement ``sludge revisions'' to Parts 122 and124 proposed today which are applicable to State programs (as specifiedin those parts). A few commenters misread the 1988 proposal as not requiring ``fully documented''programs when a State modifies its existing NPDES program to include anapproved sludge program. Section 123.62(b)(1) requires a State to submitmodified program documents when it seeks to revise an existing State NPDESprogram. Thus, States will be expected to fully document their authorityand ability to administer an approved sludge program. This program revisionwould be similar in scope to a revision to add pretreatment to an existingNPDES program. As noted above, States with existing NPDES programs havemany of the permitting requirements and procedures already in place, andtherefore will not have to substantially modify their programs. But tobe approved, States would have to modify their program documents to explainhow the existing program applies to the new sludge component.K. Miscellaneous One commenter on the 1986 proposal argued that in several areas where EPAexpressed an intent to issue supplemental guidance (e.g., self-monitoringfrequencies, compliance inspection schedules), the Agency must promulgateregulations rather than issue guidance. In most instances noted by thecommenter, the final rule is more specific in establishing minimum requirementsthan the 1986 proposal (e.g., minimum self-monitoring frequencies, Stateinspections of Class I sludge management facilities). However, EPA stillexpects to issue guidance documents which interpret today's final ruleand provide guidance on applying general requirements to specific situations,consistent with past practice. EPA disagrees with the commenter that guidanceis inappropriate in these situations.EPA received several comments not addressed above with regard to provisionsin the 1986 proposal that were not included in the 1988 proposal. A separatesummary of these comments and the Agency's response to them has been includedin the public record of this rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is majorand, therefore, subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.A major rule is defined as a regulation which is likely to result in: (1)An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increasein the costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,and local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significantadverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. Today's rule establishes the mechanism (permits) for implementing standardsfor sludge use and disposal which will be promulgated under a separaterulemaking (to be codified at 40 CFR Part 503). The potential impacts ofthe Part 503 standards on regulated parties and the need for a RegulatoryImpact Statement will be considered in conjunction with that rulemaking.Therefore, EPA disagrees with commenters who said that the economic impactsof this rule were not properly considered in the absence of informationabout Part 503. Today's rule also establishes requirements for the submission and approvalof State sludge management programs. States are not required to seek programapproval under these rules. In any event, the requirements relating tooptional State submission of programs for EPA approval do not impose largecosts upon State regulatory agencies. Therefore, the rule does not satisfyany of the criteria for a major rule as specified in section 1(b) of theExecutive Order and as such does not constitute a major rulemaking. Thisregulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA, whichdiscusses reporting requirements imposed by today's final rule and estimatesthe annual burden to respondents (POTWs, other treatment works treatingdomestic sewage, and States seeking EPA approval of their sludge managementprograms) for complying with these requirements. This document reflectschanges made to the final rule in response to public comments on the informationcollection requirements contained in the proposed rule. No public commentsaddressing the ICR itself were received. However, EPA received numerouscomments on the proposed regulations which imposed information collectionrequirements. EPA's responses to these comments are included in the abovediscussion of the final rule.The preamble to the proposed rule stated that EPA would respond in thepreamble to the final rule to any comments submitted by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) on the ICR which was prepared to accompany the proposedrule. OMB submitted three comments on the ICR. OMB's first comment was that the ICR goes beyond the scope of the proposedrule. The ICR covers only the rules promulgated today. However, informationcollection requirements for the sludge program will also be establishedin the Part 503 technical rules. The ICR now more clearly explains therelationship between today's rule (and ICR) and the Part 503 rule (andICR). The two offices responsible for the ICRs worked closely to coordinatetheir efforts. The final ICR clearly distinguishes the respective burdensimposed by the two rules. OMB's second comment was that it would carefully consider the burdens ofany minimum monitoring frequency imposed by the rule. Today's rule requiresmonitoring and reporting at least annually for all permittees. As discussedin the preamble, EPA has determined that, as a general rule, annual monitoring(for at least the parameters regulated in 40 CFR Part 503) is the minimumnecessary to assure compliance with federal standards. More frequent monitoringmay be imposed as part of the Part 503 technical standards or by the permitwriter based on best professional judgment. OMB also questioned whether State reporting to EPA needed to occur quarterlyas proposed. Today's rule reduces the frequency for State noncompliancereports from quarterly to semi-annually, in response to concerns aboutthe reporting burden imposed on States. EPA expects that semi-annual reportswill be adequate for purposes of State program oversight and enforcementactions. The information collection requests in this rule have been approved byOMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>and have been assigned OMB Control No. 2040-0128. Thereporting and recordkeeping burden on the public for this collection isestimated at 200,008 hours for 16,379 respondents, with an average of 12.2hours per response. There are two major categories of respondents withsignificantly different burdens. EPA expects that States seeking programapproval will have an average annual burden of 664 hours per State, andtreatment works treating domestic sewage (i.e., permittees) will have anaverage annual burden of 11.26 hours per respondent. These burden estimatesinclude all aspects of the collection effort and may include time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, completing and reviewing the collection of information,etc. If you have questions or comments regarding any aspect of this collectionof information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, or if youwould like a copy of the information collection request (please referenceICR No. 1237.03), contact Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S.Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460(202-382-2745); and Timothy Hunt, Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>EPA is required to prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysisto assess the impact of its rules on small entities. No regulatory flexibilityanalysis is required, however, where the head of the agency certifies thatthe rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. Today's proposed rule most directly affects State agencies.It also affects treatment works that generate and dispose of sewage sludge,by specifying that any applicable requirements promulgated under separateregulations be implemented through requirements in permits issued to thetreatment works. In nearly all cases, these treatment works already arerequired to obtain the permits under existing federal or State programs.Accordingly, I hereby certify pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this amendmentwill not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>40 CFR Part 122Administrative practice and procedure, Confidential business information,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sewage disposal, Waste treatmentand disposal, Water pollution control. 40 CFR Part 123Confidential business information, Hazardous materials, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Sewage disposal, Waste treatment and disposal, Water pollutioncontrol, Penalties. 40 CFR Part 124Administrative practice and procedure, Air pollution control, Hazardousmaterials, Sewage disposal, Waste treatment and disposal, Water pollutioncontrol, Water supply, Indians_lands. 40 CFR Part 501Confidential business information, Environmental protection, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements, Publicly owned treatment works, Sewagedisposal, Waste treatment and disposal.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
