There is a needfor this change because of the possible altering of attention and performancelevels of a licensee and/or its contractors when the licensee is awareof NRC surveillance. Past occurrences where site and/or contractor personnelhave been notified of NRC's presence on site have heightened concern inthis area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>effective date: </T2>October 25, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:  </T2>George Barber, Office of NuclearReactor Regulation, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC20555, Telephone (301) 492-1234.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>By clarifying the meaning and intent of 10 CFR 50.70(b)(3), this finalrule should ensure that NRC inspectors will be granted immediate and unannouncedaccess to licensee facilities so as to provide the inspector with unfetteredaccess equivalent to that provided a regular plant employee following properidentification and compliance with applicable access control procedures.This rule provides that no access control measures or other means may beemployed by the licensee or its contractors to intentionally give noticeto other persons of the arrival and presence of an NRC inspector at a facility,unless the licensee is specifically requested to do so by the NRC inspector.There have been instances in the past at several facilities that compromisedthe ability of properly badged NRC inspectors to inspect and access, onan unannounced basis, activities related to the license or constructionpermit when licensee employees or contractor employees informed othersat the facility of the presence of the NRC inspectors. This change to 10CFR 50.70 is to clarify that NRC inspectors, badged at the facility, haveimmediate, unescorted access to ongoing activities as these activitiesare being performed without advanced notification of the inspection. Thisis especially important during non-normal business hours when operatingpersonnel might assume NRC inspectors would not be on site.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Comments</ITAG>On March 18, 1988, the Commission published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 8924) a notice of proposed rulemakingon ``Licensee Announcement of Inspectors.'' The Commission invited thepublic to comment on the proposed rule and received six letters of commentby April 18, 1988 (the specified closing date for public comments). AfterApril 18, 1988, 26 additional letters of comments were received. All 32letters of comments were considered in NRC's review of this final rule.The comments are discussed below.<T3>Comment. </T3>A majority of the commenters believed the rule was unnecessaryand characterized it as being too broad and vague. They asserted that it:was redundant with current regulations; would lead to unfair and impracticalenforcement; be impossible to implement; inhibit inspector assistance byplant personnel; limit the ability of facility management to perform theirsafety functions; promote lying among the facility staff; require formaltraining and recordkeeping; and indicates a distrust of licensees.<T3>NRC Response. </T3>NRC does not agree with the comments, but to ensurethat the intent of the rule is clear and focused, adds the following clarificationof the rule. The intent of this rule is to prevent site and contractorpersonnel from widespread dissemination or broadcasting the presence ofan NRC inspector. Broadcasting, as used here, is defined as unsolicitedone-way communications. Implementing or enforcing this rule should be nomore difficult than implementing or enforcing any rule that involves personnelperformance.Adopting this rule does not indicate a predisposition on the part of theNRC that licensees are not acting properly. It is human nature for an individualto be more conscious of his or her performance when the individual realizeshe or she is being observed. The NRC inspection program evaluates licenseeperformance on the basis of a sampling of its activities. It is criticalthat the sampling portion of the licensee's activities that are reliedupon for this evaluation be representative of its overall activities. Therefore,the rule is more prophylactic than proscriptive, although it does carryenforcement sanctions should it be violated. Recognizing the possibilityof inadvertent communication of an inspector's presence, the NRC expectsto reserve enforcement action for significant intentional violations ofthe rule. An honest response by an employee to an innocent inquiry thathe/she just saw an NRC inspector is not within the proscriptive perimeterof the rule. Therefore, an employee would not be required to lie, in responseto a question, about the presence of an NRC inspector. Based on this discussion,formalized training will not be necessary, and NRC Form 3 need not be modifiedto reflect this requirement.The NRC does not agree that this rule will prevent management from performingits safety functions. It should be noted the rule does not affect softwaresecurity systems which monitor the presence of persons in certain areas.Such systems should provide the licensee with needed information on spaceoccupancy in the case of an emergency or evacuation. For those licenseeswho have these systems in place, or will put them in place, the rule doesnot affect such systems. If a licensee were, however, to design or modifythese systems (or use them) for the purpose of monitoring the NRC inspector'smovements in order to alert other plant personnel of the inspector's whereabouts,those actions would violate the rule.In sum, the licensee is prohibited from taking affirmative action whichwould compromise the NRC inspector's mission of gaining unfettered accessto the plant and its various areas of interest to the inspector.<T3>Comment.</T3> Some commenters expressed a concern that the rule couldraise Constitutional questions under the First and Fourth Amendments.<T3>NRC Response.</T3> As discussed above, the purpose of the rule is toenhance the credibility of the inspection process. Inspections are specificallyauthorized under section 161o of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,42 U.S.C. 2201(o). The regulation is narrowly drawn to achieve a legitimategovernmental interest (effective NRC inspections) without infringing onan individual's right to express ideas and opinions on any subject. Thus,the regulation does not impermissively intrude upon freedom of speech protectedby the First Amendment to the Constitution.The regulation does not raise any significant Fourth Amendment considerations.The Atomic Energy Act creates a pervasive regulatory scheme that puts licenseeson clear notice that they will be subject to inspection, and the grantingof a license is conditioned on consent to reasonable inspections. Thus,NRC inspections of licensees' premises, activities and records do not requirea warrant under the Fourth Amendment. United States Nuclear RegulatoryCommission vs Radiation Technology, Inc., 519 F. Supp. 1266, 1288-91 (D.N.J.1981): Union Electric Co. (Callaway Plant, Units 1 andamp; 2), ALAB-527,9 NRC 126, 139-41 (1979). The new regulation is a reasonable exercise ofthe Commission's inspection authority. Inspectors will continue to identifythemselves and comply with other reasonable access control measures and,as always, inspections will be conducted for purposes authorized underthe Atomic Energy Act and the Energy Reorganization Act. The regulationdoes not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.<T3>Comment. </T3>A number of commenters suggested that the rule be implementedonly by written request of the NRC inspector.<T3>NRC Response.</T3> NRC rejects the suggestion. With this suggestedmodification, the rule would only apply to those individuals who had beengiven notice of the NRC inspector's presence on site. If implemented, thissuggestion would defeat the intent of the rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion</ITAG>The NRC has determined that this change is the type of action describedin categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore neither an environmentalimpact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared forthis final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement</ITAG>The final rule does not contain a new or amended information collectionrequirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501et seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Managementand Budget approval number 3150-0011.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>This final rule will have no significant impact on state and local governmentsand geographical regions. It may have a significant impact on health, safety,and the environment, but only in the sense of preventing adverse impactson health, safety, and the environment through more effective inspections.The rule will make it clear that NRC inspectors are to have a realisticpicture of the actual conditions at a site during the inspection processand, therefore, be better able to identify potentially dangerous conditionsand/or practices for corrective action and to ensure that licensees complywith laws, regulations, and orders administered by the NRC. This constitutesthe regulatory analysis for this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Certification</ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), theCommission certifies that this final rule does not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. The final rule appliesonly to licensees authorized to construct or operate nuclear power reactors,who are not small business entities within the meaning of the act or implementingregulations. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not beenprepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">Backfit Analysis</ITAG>The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does applyto this final rule. The backfit analysis for announcement of inspectorsrule in accordance with each of the factors specified in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(4)(ii)(c)is as follows:(1) This rule provides that no means may be employed by the licensee orits contractors to intentionally give notice to other persons of the arrivaland presence of a NRC inspector at a facility, unless the licensee is specificallyrequested to do so by the NRC inspector.(2) The licensee will have to communicate the requirements of this ruleto its personnel and to contractor personnel working at its site.(3) The purpose of this rule is to enhance the credibility of the inspectionprocess. By requiring that the presence of NRC inspectors (either residentor off site) is not announced, the NRC, public and licensees will havemore confidence that the activities inspectors are witnessing are representativeof licensee performance. Ensuring that NRC inspectors are witnessing representativelicensee performance could substantially increase the likelihood that NRCinspectors will discover unsafe or potentially unsafe practices, bringabout corrective actions and thereby lower the risk of accidents occurringwhich could lead to the accidental off-site release of radioactive material.It is not possible, without before and after data, to quantitatively evaluatethe benefits of implementing this rule. Still, a recent significant enforcementaction concerning licensee employee's inattention to duty demonstratesthe premise advanced in the above paragraph. In this enforcement action,over 30 licensee personnel, both management and staff were cited for inattentionto duty. The primary concern was sleeping on watch. It is not difficultto envision accidents that could occur because of this type of licenseeperformance.Coupling inattention to duty with equipment failure adds a new dimensionto the risk of accidents occurring which could lead to the off-site releaseof radioactive material. In the enforcement action mentioned above, hadthe licensee announced the presence of the NRC inspector, the inattentionto duty would have gone unnoticed. It should be noted that the licenseefacility where this incident occurred did, on one past occasion, announcethe presence of NRC inspectors.(4) Not appropriate. There is no radiological exposure of facility employeesresulting from the rule's implementation.(5) Very minor costs are associated with the rule's implementation. Thereare no training requirements or record keeping requirements associatedwith this rule. The only cost to the licensee would be communicating thisrule to its employees and contractors.(6) Not appropriate. There is no potential safety impact of changes inplant or operational complexity associated with this rule.(7) Not appropriate. There is no resource burden on the NRC from the implementationof this rule.(8) Not appropriate. There is no potential impact of differences in facilitytype, design or age on the relevancy and practicality of the proposed backfit.(9) The proposed backfit is final.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>Based on the above analysis, the Commission concludes that there is a substantialincrease in the overall protection of the public health and safety or thecommon defense and security to be derived from this backfit and that thedirect and indirect costs of implementation for facilities are justifiedin view of this increased protection.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 50</ITAG>Antitrust, Classified information, Fire protection, Incorporation by reference,Intergovernmental relations, Nuclear power plants and reactors, Penalty,Radiation protection, Reactor siting criteria, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of theAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the NRC is to adopt the followingamendment to 10 CFR Part 50.<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 50_DOMESTIC LICENSING OF PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION FACILITIES</ITAG>1.
