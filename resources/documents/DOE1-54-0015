In particular,innovative technologies may present new avenues for converting woodybiomass into gasoline. This paper summarizes the technical and economicresults of Science Applications International Corporation's (SAIC's)recent evaluation of two such advanced biomass-to-gasoline processes:(1) a fast pyrolysis process developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology,in which the wood pyrolyzate is upgraded via two-stage hydrotreating,and (2) the Solar Energy Research Institute flash ablative pyrolysisprocess, in which pyrolyzate vapors are upgraded via deoxygenation overzeolite catalysts. The purpose of this evaluation was to determine theeconomic bounds of these processes and the R andamp; D required to developthem to their full economic potential. The results indicate that gasolinecan be produced from a 1000-tpd future biomass conversion plant via GeorgiaTech fast pyrolysis for about $0.86 to $1.07 per gallon of product ata potential yield of 91.6 gallons per ton (dry), and via SERI flash pyrolysisfor about $0.94 to $1.13 per gallon at a yield of 65.5 gallons per ton(dry).</TEXT></DOC>
