This regulation requires the Commonwealth of MassachusettsDepartment of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) to determine andimpose RACT on all stationary sources with the potential to emit one hundredtons per year (TPY) or more of VOCs that are not already subject to RACTunder Massachusetts' regulations developed pursuant to the EPA ControlTechniques Guideline (CTG) documents. In a November 17, 1982 letter toEPA, the DEQE committed to submit each of the individual RACT determinationsto EPA for incorporation into the Massachusetts SIP. On November 9, 1983,EPA codified at 40 CFR 52.1123 that the DEQE must submit each RACT determinationmade under 310 CMR 7.18(17) to EPA as a SIP revision in order to incorporatethe limitations into the SIP. EPA's rationale for requiring the DEQE tosubmit each RACT determination as a single source SIP revision is thatemission limits and reduction measures imposed by states on existing stationarysources in nonattainment areas do not constitute RACT unless and untilEPA approves them as RACT via rulemaking. Boston Whaler, Inc. in Rockland, Massachusetts is a non-CTG VOC sourcesubject to RACT under Massachusetts' Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17). On August26, 1986 and June 30, 1987, EPA received a proposed SIP revision from theMassachusetts DEQE. This revision includes the DEQE's proposed Plan Approval,State Order SM-85-116-1F, issued under 310 CMR 7.18(17) to Boston Whaler,Inc. in Rockland, Massachusetts on July 8, 1986. This proposed Plan Approvalimposes RACT for Boston Whaler's non-CTG processes and specifies a December31, 1986 compliance date. Although the proposed Plan Approval issued bythe DEQE is currently fully enforceable by that agency under State law,the formal SIP revision submitted by the DEQE to EPA must consist of thePlan Approval amended as specified by this notice before EPA will undertakefinal rulemkaing approving it as RACT and incorporating it into the SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of RACT Determination</ITAG>Boston Whaler has three production processes that emit VOCs at its Rocklandfacility. The three production processes are fiberglass boat fabrication,clean-up operations, and miscellaneous operations. As stated above, onAugust 26, 1986 and June 30, 1987, the DEQE submitted State Order SM-85-116-1Fas a proposed Plan Approval for Boston Whaler's Rockland facility. Thatproposed Plan Approval imposes requirements on Boston Whaler which theDEQE has determined to constitute RACT to reduce VOC emissions. The requirementsof the proposed Plan Approval are summarized below:Fiberglass Boat Fabricationa. A reduced-styrene content gelcoat resin must continue to be used.b. New gelcoat application equipment is required which reduces the amountof resin required per unit of production.c. Improved gelcoat and laminating resin management and engineering changesto reduce usage and emissions are required.Clean-up Operationsa. Closed-top dip tanks are required.b. Employees contacting laminating resin are required to wear gloves.c. Employee training to reduce cleaning solvent usage is required.d. Boston Whaler, Inc. must control and track the use of organic cleaningsolvent.e. Work practice modifications are required including the substitutionof a water-based cleaning solution for an organic cleaning solvent forsome applications.Miscellaneous Operationsa. The methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) content in the Gelcoat Catalyst must bereduced through the installation of new application equipment.b. Emissions must be reduced from the reformulated varnishes.As a result of these VOC emission reduction measures imposed in the proposedPlan Approval, Boston Whaler, Inc.'s Rockland facility will achieve a plantwideemission reduction of approximately 38%, when 1983 baseline emission levelsare compared with emission levels after control. The year 1983 was usedas the baseline year instead of the 1980 baseline year of the SIP as aresult of several factors which complicated or invalidated comparisonsbetween present and future emissions. For example, the production of smallsailboats from 1979 to 1982 significantly changed the potential productionand emissions per boat during that time. Additionally, recordkeeping hasimproved greatly for the period since 1983.In addition to the above individual VOC emission reduction measures whichthe DEQE has determined to constitute RACT, the proposed Plan Approvalalso requires Boston Whaler to meet the emission rates expressed in poundsof VOC emitted per boat produced. These emission rates are imposed as additionalrequirements on Boston Whaler to assure that the VOC emission reductionsresulting from the continuous compliance with the RACT measures as statedabove are permanent. The final compliance date contained in the proposedPlan Approval is December 31, 1986. These emission rates are specifiedin the proposed Plan Approval for each of Boston Whaler's three productionprocesses as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s10,12</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Pounds VOC/per boat produced, effective Dec. 31, 1986</H1><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Fiberglass boat fabrication</T3><D>16.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Clean-up operations</T3><D>8.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Miscellaneous operations</T3><D>5.2</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total pounds VOC emitted/boat<D>\1\ 30.3</D><F>\1\ This represents a 38% reduction over 1983 emission levels, on aper boat produced basis.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Whether Boston Whaler is complying with the above emission limitationswill be determined in accordance with records of VOC usage which it isrequired to maintain. In order to assure that Boston Whaler is adheringto the improved gelcoat and laminating resin management policy in its dailyoperations, it is required to update the following recordkeeping forms:Gelcoat Daily Reconcilement; Laminating Resin Daily Reconcilement; DailyVOC Chemical Usage; and Rockland Wood Division Chemical Usage. In addition,Boston Whaler is required to control and track the use of organic cleaningsolvent by updating the recordkeeping form, ``Rockland Daily Cleaning SolventUsage.'' This will provide Boston Whaler the information necessary to determinethe amount of cleaning solvent which can be allocated to various departmentsand still meet Boston Whaler's usage reduction goals.EPA has reviewed the proposed Plan Approval and supporting documents submittedas a SIP revision for parallel-processing and generally concurs with theDEQE's RACT determination. For more details on EPA's review and justificationof Boston Whaler's RACT determination, see the Technical Support Documentavailable at the EPA Regional Office listed in the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this notice. However, the proposed Plan Approvalitself must be amended as explained below before EPA will conduct finalrulemaking to approve and incorporate it into the SIP.The proposed Plan Approval specifies certain work practice standards andprocess modifications as emission reduction measures for fiberglass boatfabrication, clean-up operations, and miscellaneous operations which theDEQE has determined to constitute RACT for Boston Whaler. These RACT requirements,as currently written in the proposed Plan Approval, in general are notclearly enforceable and the emission reductions calculated to result fromtheir implementation, therefore, may not occur. EPA is proposing to approvethe Commmonwealth of Massachusetts' proposed Plan Approval (Order SM-85-116-IF)as RACT for Boston Whaler's Rockland facility. However, before EPA willconduct final rulemaking approving this Plan Approval as a SIP revision,the DEQE must add the requirements listed below to clarify the RACT emissionreduction measures and to make them more enforceable. The DEQE also mustspecify the final compliance date of December 31, 1986 for the followingrequirements. Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17) requires subject stationary sourcesto demonstrate compliance with RACT as expeditiously as practicable butno later than December 31, 1986.Fiberglass Boat Fabrication1. The final Plan Approval must specify a maximum styrene monomer contentto be met on a continuous basis for the reduced-styrene content gelcoatand polyester laminating resins and require Boston Whaler to use only thesetypes of resins.2. The final Plan Approval must specify the type of gelcoat applicationsequipment (e.g., airless, air-assisted airless, or electrostatic sprayequipment) that has been demonstrated to use less resin by providing amore even and less porous coating, thereby reducting the VOCs emitted perunit of production. This measure could be made enforceable by requiringBoston Whaler to use only this specific type of gelcoat application equipment.Clean-up Operations1. The final Plan Approval must specify that all cleaning solvent dip tanks'and containers' lids are closed at all times except when an item is beingentered into or removed.2. The final Plan Approval must require Boston Whaler to operate its in-housesolvent recovery system to reclaim waste organic cleaning solvent, andmust include specific operating requirements for the solvent recovery system.First, the final Plan Approval must specify a maximum weight percentageof VOC content to be met on a continuous basis for the solvent recoverysystem's residues. This maximum VOC content by weight should be initiallyestablished using the solvent recovery system's design specifications andthe reduction in VOC emissions accounted for during RACT implementation.In addition, the final Plan Approval must also specify, at minimum, oneof the following limitations for the solvent recovery system in accordancewith its design specifications: (1) A maximum concentration of outlet VOCsfrom the condensor's vent (i.e., in parts per million by volume of VOC)not to be exceeded, (2) a maximum temperature of the condensor's vent notto be exceeded, or (3) a maximum temperature of the condensor's coolantnot to be exceeded. This will assure that the solvent recovery system isoperating as intended and designed. Finally, the Plan Approval must requirethat the waste organic cleaning solvent (before being recovered) and thesolvent recovery system's residues (before being sent out as a waste product)must be stored in closed containers to prevent evaporation.3. The final Plan Approval must specify what portion of the solvent cleaningof brushes, rollers, spray guns, hands, etc. is done with the newly introducednon-volatile, water-based, cleaning solvent. The final Plan Approval mustrequire Boston Whaler to use only this water-based cleaning solvent indesignated areas where reduction in VOC emissions from its use were accountedfor during RACT implementation. In addition, the final Plan Approval mustspecify for each cleaning solvent: the name, an emission rate in poundsof VOC per gallon of cleaning solvent to be met on a continuous basis,designated area(s) for its application, and a daily maximum consumptionin gallons of VOC per day.Miscellaneous OperationsThe final Plan Approval must specify a maximum feed ratio of gelcoat catalystto fiberglass resin in accordance with reduction in VOC emissions thatwere anticipated due to the installation of new application equipment underthe RACT determination. Likewise, for the ``Finishing Area'' where themolded boat hulls are finished, the final Plan Approval must specify amaximum content to be met on a continuous basis of naphtha/mineral spiritsand other VOC(s) in the polyester resin catalyst in either volume or weightpercent. Finishing includes repairing any defects on the molded hull aswell as plugging and patching any holes caused by the molding tools.In addition, for the Wood Division where the wooden components (e.g., seats,consoles, locker covers) are varnished, the final Plan Approval must specifyemission limits for both the urethane varnish(es) and the hardener(s) inpounds of VOC per gallon of solids. Further, the final Plan Approval mustspecify a maximum amount of varnish thinner that is allowed per gallonof the two-component urethane (i.e., urethane varnish and varnish hardenermixed together). These emission limits must be determined and imposed onBoston Whaler in accordance with reduction in VOC emissions achieved fromthe reformulation of the urethane varnishes which involved increasing thesolids contents of the urethane resins while reducing the amount of varnishthinner (VOC). The Plan Approval must require that all these emission limitationsbe met on a continuous basis. Finally, once EPA has approved the Plan Approval,any amendment to it must be submitted as a SIP revision. Today's ActionIn order for EPA to take final action approving the DEQE's Plan Approvalfor Boston Whaler, that Plan Approval must be amended to include the requirementsoutlined in this notice. If the DEQE's final Plan Approval does not incorporatethe requirements outlined in this notice to clearly define Boston Whaler'sRACT VOC emission reduction measures and insure their enforceability, EPAwill withdraw this proposed action to approve it and publish an actionproposing to disapprove Boston Whaler's Plan Approval.EPA is soliciting public comments on issues discussed in this notice. Thesecomments will be considered before taking final action. Interested partiesmay participate in the Federal rulemaking procedures by submitting writtencomments to the address above.This revision is being proposed under a procedure called ``parallel processing''(47 FR 27073). If the proposed revision is substantially changed, in areasother than those required in this notice, EPA will evaluate those changesand may publish a revised NPR. If no substantial changes are made otherthan those areas cited in this notice, EPA will publish a Final RulemakingNotice on the revision. The final rulemaking action by EPA will occur onlyafter the final Plan Approval for Boston Whaler has been issued by theDEQE and has been formally submitted to EPA for incorporation into theSIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action:</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve Commonwealth of Massachusetts' ORDER SM-85-116-IF,a proposed Plan Approval, as a revision to the Massachusetts SIP with theunderstanding that the DEQE will revise the proposed Plan Approval as outlinedin this notice prior to its formal submittal to EPA for incorporation intothe SIP.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the SIP revisionwill be based on whether it meets the requirements of sections 110(a)(2)(A)-(K)and 110(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in40 CFR Part 51.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Ozone, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 22, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Michael R.
