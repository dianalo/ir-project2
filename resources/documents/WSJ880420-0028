Gets $250 Million Payment From '87 Agrico Sale </HL><SO> </SO><CO> WMB FRP FTX </CO><IN> CHM </IN><DATELINE> TULSA, Okla.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Williams Cos. received a $250 million contingent payment as part of its sale last year of Agrico Chemicals Co. to Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners.    The quick cash payment underscores the strength of the fertilizer industry following Agrico's acquisition by the New Orleans-based limited partnership. Under terms of the original sale, Williams was guaranteed only $100 million in deferred compensation -- and might have had to wait five years to receive even that much -- depending on Agrico's financial results.    &quot;We are extremely gratified that the performance of the Agrico assets was such that we received the full contingency payment&quot; in only a year, said Joseph H. Williams, chairman and chief executive officer of Williams.    The long-depressed agricultural-chemicals business has lately recovered, thanks partly to higher export sales as a result of the declining dollar. In addition, U.S. farm income has been recovering from its long depression.    Williams shed Agrico and interests in several other mineral business as part of a broad restructuring program over the past two years. The company has remained a major pipeline operation and has lately expanded its interests to include fiber-optics telecommunications services.    Williams said that it will use the cash for general corporate purposes, including debt reduction, and that the payment will add $95 million to first-quarter net income. A year earlier net was $54.4 million, or $1.58 a share, including big gains from other asset sales, on revenue of $535.6 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Williams closed at $30.50, up 87.5 cents.    The partnership, which is affiliated with Freeport-McMoRan Inc., an oil and gas concern, said it would finance at least half of the $250 million payment through the sale of equity securities, with the balance of the funds coming from a debt offering or from bank borrowings.    The partnership's units closed yesterday at $20.75, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
