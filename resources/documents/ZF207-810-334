 More and moreoperations managers, wary of a computer room without humans, have discoveredso-called &quot;lights dim&quot; alternatives.andM;While there is no precise definition of lights dim, managers generally agreethat it stops short of full &quot;lights out&quot; operations.andP;  Whereas lights outoperations means a fully automated computer room, lights dim operationsautomate such tasks as message suppression, and people are still very much incharge.andM;Suzanne Nicastro, product manager at Legent Corp. in Pittsburgh, said manycompanies quickly turned to the lights dim approach, despite the efforts ofvendors to market the fully automated capabilities.andM;&quot;The industry has built up lights out as a goal, but in the real life,day-to-day world of data centers, most companies want people around,&quot;Nicastro said.andP;  &quot;They may not be in the computer room, but they are there.&quot;andM;Nicastro said she recently surveyed her user base and found &quot;they feel muchmore comfortable with people around.andP;  They want to automate a majority of thework so that people are not sitting there around the clock.andP;  Instead ofhaving five or six operators with a bank of consoles, you will find one ortwo personal computers and a manager.&quot;andM;A growing number of large companies are putting this theory into practice.andM;For example, Shearson Lehman Hutton, a New York-based financial servicesfirm, automatically starts up and shuts down 100-plus CICS regions and abouta dozen IDMS regions in its testing environment.andP;  &quot;It would take an operatorall day to do that,&quot; said Steve D'Amato, automated operations manager atShearson.andM;In production applications, the Shearson IBM 3090 mainframe automaticallyrecovers after a failure, he said.andP;  About 69% of the console messages aresuppressed, according to D'Amato.andM;&quot;We've got to see some of this stuff--alerts, for example,&quot; D'Amato said.andO;&quot;but who wants to see messages when everything is running normal?&quot;andM;&quot;CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATING&quot;andM;Shearson is &quot;continuously evaluating&quot; how to further automate the operations,but is moving forward cautiously, D'Amato said.andP;  The possibilities include:automating additional work done at the same time each day; standardizingreplies to messages; and simplifying complex commands for JES and MVS.andM;&quot;Our main goal is to automate as much as possible, to provide better responsetime and availability,&quot; D'Amato said.andM;&quot;There will always be human beings in operations.andP;  They may not be operators,though--they may be the people who program the automated operations products.andO;They will be more technical than the operators we have today,&quot; D'Amato said.andM;Fred Tremblay, vice president of sales and marketing at Candle Corp., LosAngeles, agrees that a key opportunity for vendors of those products is tooffer packages that &quot;do mundane tasks--things that are tedious and prone tomistakes.&quot;andM;Those capabilities would allow operators to hold what he called &quot;thinkingjobs,&quot; such as managing the level of service provided to users.andP;  The result,Tremblay said, is a quality improvement that would no longer force operatorsto constantly watch a console.andM;Still, Tremblay allows, &quot;I'm not sure a completely automated data center iseveryone's goal.&quot;andP;  He compares a fully automated data center to an airplane.andO;He said people want a pilot on board, despite the fact the plane can take offand land by itself.andM;&quot;A data center is not a programmed series of events.andP;  It's a constantlychanging environment--new applications and new users are being added all thetime,&quot; Tremblay said.andP;  &quot;There's an insecurity to trust everything toautomation when you can't write everything down and you can't foreseeeverything.&quot;andM;In addition, he said, the return on automating an entire operation may not beworth the investment.andP;  &quot;What kind of investment will you have to make tofully automate everything?&quot;andM;Automating the last 10% may cost three times as much as automating the first90%, he said.andM;The current state-of-the-art products, many observers agree, allow a testingenvironment or a remote data center to be almost fully automated.andP;  On theother hand, a main data center running major production applications isunlikely to be automated.andM;LIGHTS OUT AT BUandM;Such concerns have not stopped Boston University in its effort to eliminateall operators in one of the college's main computer centers by the end ofnext year, says Howard Miller, BU associate vice president of informationsystems.andM;The IBM 3090/200 mainframe to be automated supports administrative functionsof registration, payroll and other areas, Miller said.andM;Over the past two years, the Boston0based college has completed a 60%reduction in the number of people in the data center, doubled the system'scapacity, and improved the response time 97%, to better than 99%.andP;  He notedthat improvements were made using a budget that declined by 25% during thesame period.andM;&quot;To do this, you have to make a commitment that people will not lose theirjobs,&quot; Miller said.andP;  &quot;We work to turn people into paraprofessionals and movethem into other areas.&quot;andM;But even Miller acknowledges that &quot;most big computer centers aren't ready forlights out operations.andP;  They just can't picture it; it's a perceptionproblem.&quot;andM;Miller predicts that an average shop will take two five years to implement asignificant automated operations system.andM;However, he stresses &quot;there is no technical obstacle&quot; to achieving lights outoperations today--a point debated by industry experts.andM;TECHNOLOGY UNCERTAINandM;For example, Jeff Schulman, vice president of software management policy atThe Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn.-based consulting firm, says there are nosuitable environmental sensors to alert operations management to things likefire and flood.andM;&quot;And since there are also no automated counterparts for people who changepaper and mount tapes, the thought is to use these people as the sensors,&quot;Schulman said.andM;He added that while lights out operations are &quot;within the planning cycles ofmost large companies,&quot; the implementation could be very difficult for manyreasons.andM;The technology will not stop any prospective implementation of automatedoperations, Schulman said.andP;  &quot;We're talking about revolution here--what are wegoing to do with the operators?andP;  Entire organizations and empires have beenbuilt up around operations.andP;  All have something to protect.&quot;andM;Schulman said that lights dim operations may be more appropriate forrisk-averse companies.andM;Regardless of what is implemented, he said, it is critical to understand andcodify rules and procedures in terms of &quot;if&quot; statement logic.andM;Some observers maintain that a lights dim operation is just a step in theprocess of implementing a full lights out system.andM;CRITICAL POSITIONINGandM;&quot;The majority of clients are interested in exploring the software to themaximum degree possible,&quot; said G. Adrien Brooks, a software manager atComputer Associates International Inc., Garden City, N.Y.andP;  &quot;They want toposition themselves so that when the next step is available, they can moveright in.&quot;andM;No matter which philosophy is followed, vendors contend that automatingoperations is not a one-step process.andM;&quot;The purchase of one product is not going to do it,&quot; declares Nicastro ofLegent.andP;  &quot;Look at all of the aspects and try it out to see how it works onpart of a shift or during a holiday.&quot;andM;In fact, many organizations, such as Caterpillar Inc., Joliet, Ill., are juststarting to internally debate the merits of automating operations.andM;At Caterpillar, there are &quot;no formal goals&quot; for implementing automatedoperations, said Jack Coleman, a senior analyst in the company's technicalsupport operation.andM;&quot;But [automated operations] is a current topic, and next year we'll considerit for budgeting,&quot; Coleman said.andP;  However, he allows that Caterpillar is &quot;along way from lights out.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
