PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tearful Armenians laid flowers before pictures oftheir dead brethren Sunday to mark the anniversary of three days ofethnic rioting that killed at least 32 people a year ago andgalvanized a nationalist movement.   ``Events have shown that we can't automatically trust theauthorities. The time for automatic trust has passed,'' activistEduard Gevandov told a crowd of several hundred gathered at thesteps of Moscow's Armenian church.   Authorities sanctioned the gathering, held to commemorate riotingin the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait on Feb. 28-29 and March 1 lastyear.   Speaker Arkady Semyonov called them ``three black andunforgettable days.''   Soviet officials say 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis died inthe violence, but Armenians insist the toll was much higher.   Photocopies of pictures of victims and their death certificateswere displayed on a wall of the brick church. Armenians laid lilies,red carnations and tulips before the pictures and raised candles asfuneral music played.   Banners raised at the gathering demanded that political leadersof Azerbaijan, a republic neighboring Armenia in the Soviet Union'ssouthern Caucasus region, be found responsible for the rioting, andthat Soviet authorities denounce the violence.   Speakers criticized the Soviet press for what they said was anunfair characterization of Armenians as extremists.   A resolution called for authorities to recognize the rioting asan act of genocide, construct a monument to the victims in Moscowand release members of the activist Karabakh Committee.   The Sumgait riots broke out several weeks after thousands ofArmenians staged protests demanding annexation of theNagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.   Nagorno-Karabakh is populated predominantly by ethnic Armenians,and they consider it to be historically a part of Armenia, eventhough Soviet officials turned it over to Azerbaijan in the 1920s.   Kremlin authorities have rejected the annexation demands.   Most Azerbaijanis are Moslem and most Armenians are Christian.But Father Tiran Gureghian of the Armenian church in Moscow told thecrowd, ``The problem is not religious, not political, but purelynational and territorial.''   Almaz Yestekov, one of the founders of Islam and Democracy, a newmovement in the traditionally Moslem republics of Soviet CentralAsia, appealed for understanding between Armenians and Azerbaijanis.He said he had appealed to Azerbaijanis for calm in an interviewwith foreign radio stations.   ``We are children of the same tribe, roots of the same tree,''Yestekov said.   After the deadly riots in February, ethnic unrest erupted intoviolence again in Armenia and Azerbaijan in June, July and November.More than 60 people were killed, and in January the Kremlin imposeddirect rule over Nagorno-Karabakh.   Under the direct rule, the region's local legislature wasdissolved and a special commission was given the power to suspendall local governing councils and administrative bodies, any informalorganizations, and oversee the media, health and education.   The Armenian protests began as an appeal to President Mikhail S.Gorbachev for annexation and were fueled by his reform policies.   When Moscow authorities rejected the appeals, the movement grewto incorporate economic, cultural and environmental grievances. Someactivists called for outright independence for Armenia.   When Gorbachev visited Armenia following the Dec. 7 earthquakethere that killed 25,000 people, authorities began rounding upmembers of the Karabakh Committee who had been among the organizersof large demonstrations and general strikes.   Gevandov said the events showed authorities were incapable ofcontrolling crowds motivated by anything other than slogans theythemselves place before the people.   ``It is impossible to build a national structure without thecement of truth and sincerity,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
