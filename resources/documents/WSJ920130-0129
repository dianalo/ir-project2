Don't worry about thedeficit this year.   In his rhetoric, Mr. Bush stresses the importance ofbringing the deficit under control. In his budget numbers, hedutifully proposes cuts in government benefit programs tooffset his tax cuts, as required by the 1990 budget law, anddevotes the peace dividend to reducing the deficit.</LP><TEXT>   But in an introduction written by his budget director,Richard Darman, the president all but throws in the towel.Mr. Darman says the president &quot;would be prepared to consider&quot;a plan from Congress that ignored the politically painfulbenefit cuts and instead used the cuts in military spendingto pay for a tax reduction for American families.   The statement &quot;just sort of surrenders before the warstarts,&quot; says economist Rudolph Penner of the UrbanInstitute, a former director of the Congressional BudgetOffice. &quot;I've never seen anything like that in the budgetbefore. He says: If you don't like it, do something else.&quot;   And that something else is likely to mean a budget deficiteven bigger than Mr. Bush's budget projects: a record-busting$399 billion in the current fiscal year and $351.9 billion infiscal 1993, which begins Oct. 1.   If adopted as proposed, Mr. Bush's budget would reduce thedeficit significantly in later years -- without relying tooheavily on accounting changes that the administration issuggesting or on overly optimistic economic assumptions.Outlays would rise only 2.8% to $1.516 trillion in fiscal1993 and would fall 2.8% the following year. Total federaloutlays would actually be lower in fiscal 1994 than in fiscal1992.   &quot;The president has sent to Congress a budget that on theface of it . . . would reduce the deficit over time and atthe same time proposes things we ought to do to stimulate theeconomy and promote growth,&quot; says Carol Cox Waite, presidentof the private Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.   &quot;But then the budget director says: You don't have to makeall these hard choices. I will give you some defense savingand some creative accounting and you can slide by anotheryear. It's shocking. That's the only word for it.&quot;   At a briefing, Mr. Darman acknowledged that &quot;there couldbe a modest adverse effect on the deficit&quot; if Congressaccepts the invitation he is extending.   &quot;The peace dividend, as a matter of principle, should beavailable primarily for deficit reduction, but if a portionof it is needed in order to get the {$500-a-child increase inthe} personal exemption through, then the president would beprepared to consider it, under some pretty stringentcircumstances,&quot; Mr. Darman said.   The conditions he lists include lowering the spendingceilings set in the budget law so Congress can't both spendthe peace dividend and use it to cut taxes. They also includelimiting defense cuts to those proposed by the president:cutting the Pentagon's spending authority by $50 billion sothat actual cash outlays fall by $27.4 billion over fiveyears; the remaining savings would come in later years.   In short, Mr. Darman is laying out the conditions forbipartisan budget negotiations this year and saying, ineffect, that the administration will go along with a widerdeficit in the short term in exchange for mechanisms designedto reduce the deficit in the future.   Robert Reischauer, the current director of theCongressional Budget Office, sees some wisdom in Mr. Darman'stacticsand he doesn't often. &quot;What {Mr.} Darman is basicallydoing is putting constraints on the bidding war that mighttake place,&quot; Mr. Reischauer says. &quot;And he is putting somestrict limits on the procedural changes he would tolerate.&quot;   &quot;He is saying: I want to do this under the pay-as-you-gosystem,&quot; Mr. Reischauer says, paraphrasing Mr. Darman'sessay. &quot;If you, Congress, refuse to do that, I have a littleflexibility. But that flexibility is modest in size.&quot;   Mr. Darman probably is just acknowledging the politicalrealities: Cutting the deficit isn't likely to happen giventhe state of the economy and the political pressures of anelection year.   &quot;I think the very reason that it's so hard politically todo anything about it {the deficit} is that the harm thatcomes from it is so gradual . . . and nobody notices whileit's going on,&quot; says Mr. Penner of the Urban Institute. &quot;Butin 20 years it can make a very substantial difference in ourstandard of living. In 50 years, it can make the differencebeween the U.S. being a great world power or an also-ran likeGreat Britain.&quot;   Mr. Bush's budget does include some proposals that, ifembraced by Congress, could reduce the deficit significantlyin the future. The plan proposes, for the first time, passinga law that limits growth in federal spending on governmentbenefits -- and forces automatic cuts in those benefitprograms (except Social Security) if the cap is breached.   Under his scheme, benefit programs would be permitted toincrease somewhat faster than inflation and the growth in thepopulation; currently they go up far faster. &quot;You can't solvethe budgetary problem when you have not addressed theso-called forces,&quot; Mr. Darman said.   The administraton also proposes changes in accounting forthe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. and the deposit-insuranceprograms so that the government's books more accuratelyreflect the potential costs of these programs, an attempt tolearn from the mistakes of the savings-and-loan crisis.   Under the budget law, the accounting changes could be usedto create bookkeeping savings that could then finance taxcuts immediately. Mr. Bush relied on only about $6 billionworth of these accounting changes to meet the strictures ofthe budget law this year; he could have used far more.   After the president's attention-grabbing tax cuts, hisproposals for shifting domestic spending are likely to drawthe most attention even though many of them will be rejectedby Congress. The domestic spending for which Congress mustpass annual appropriation bills amounts to $225 billion incash outlays in Mr. Bush's budget.   Within this total, Mr. Bush would shift money towardspending on children, education, preventive health care,prisons, science and research. Offsetting that, he proposesto terminate or reduce 330 programs. He would, for instance,wipe out the Commerce Department's Economic DevelopmentAdministration as President Reagan tried unsuccessfully to dofor years. Mr. Bush would cut money for the Amtrak railroadline.   The budget freeze Mr. Bush announced in his State of theUnion speech doesn't apply to cash outlays, but rather toagencies' overall spending authority -- the money Congressputs in their checking accounts for spending this year and inthe future.   The freeze allows for big increases in some programs --Head Start, for one -- and controversial cuts in others --mass transit, for example, where deep reductions are calledfor.   The budget also relies on new fees, asset sales anddelayed expenditures to come up with short-term savings. Muchof the $1.85 billion saved in Interior Department and naturalresources accounts, for instance, comes from a plan to leasethe Naval Petroleum Reserves, a proposal Congress hasrejected in the past.   State and local governments would feel the impact of cutsin labor, health and education programs. And in the sameaccounts, Mr. Bush proposes to delay the availability of anestimated $3.6 billion in funds until the end of fiscal 1993and thereby shift the deficit impact into the followingfiscal year.   He would also try to cut the federal work force, anotherReagan notion that never quite worked. The budget calls forfreezing non-military civilian payroll (not counting thedeposit-insurance cleanup operation) at 1.17 million workers.But the freeze appears to have been hastily conceived. Atable in front of the budget shows the Tennessee ValleyAuthority losing 2,000 workers, an 8% reduction, but thedetails in the back show no such decline -- and TVA spokesmensay they believe the latter figures are correct.   Pentagon payrolls would fall. Mr. Bush would lop 40,000civilian jobs and 122,000 uniformed jobs in fiscal 1993, adecline of 4%.   In the following summary of the president's spendingplans, spending proposals for 1993 are compared with 1992levels approved by Congress. The increases aren't adjustedfor inflation or for increases in the population. Spending onany program would have to increase roughly 3.5% to keep pacewith inflation -- and many don't.                                                                                                                               Agriculture                                                                                                          Agriculture Department spending would fall 4% to $59.4billion, as cutbacks in farm credit and subsidies would morethan offset increases in food assistance and other programs.   The administration proposes boosting spending on foodstamps and nutrition programs 1.6% to $34.1 billion to meetgrowing demand for food aid. Currently, more than 25 millionpeople in the U.S. are receiving food stamps.   Farmers Home Administration outlays, meanwhile, would beslashed 44% to $2.2 billion, reflecting lower farm and ruralhousing lending and a continued shift from direct loans toguaranteed loans. The administration proposes spending $1.3billion on programs being consolidated in the RuralDevelopment Administration, which was created by Congress in1990. Spending on farm-income supports and other subsidies,inflated this year by disaster payments to farmers, wouldslip 2.5% to $11.6 billion.   Under the presidential &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; initiative,spending for land acquisition and tree planting in nationalforests would jump 25% to $599 million. At AgricultureSecretary Edward Madigan's urging, spending on nutritioneducation would rise 18% to $321 million, while spending onthe development of industrial uses for crops -- such asethanol from corn -- would rise 18% as well, to $118 million.   The administration plans to save $50 million annually byrequiring meat and poultry plants to bear a greater share ofthe costs of inspecting their products.   The administration also proposes barring any farmer withoff-farm income of $100,000 or more from receiving cropsubsidies and other farm-program benefits.                                                                                                                                Education                                                                                                          Despite strong opposition among Democrats in Congress, theWhite House is again proposing to use federal money to helpsend children to private schools.   The budget contains $640 million in budget authority forseveral &quot;educational choice&quot; initiatives, including a newprogram of &quot;choice grants&quot; that would put up $500 million infederal funds for vouchers to send children from low-incomeand moderate-income families to private schools. States wouldmatch the federal money. The administration is resurrecting aproposal that would provide $30 million for states and localdistricts to develop experimental programs offering choicesamong public and private schools. (Just last week the Senatedefeated a similar $30 million proposal.)   The federal grant program for remedial education, known asChapter 1, would be extended to disadvantaged children whoattend private school under choice programs. Chapter 1 budgetauthority would rise roughly $100 million to $6.8 billion.   Budget authority for the Education Department'sdiscretionary spending would increase by $1.6 billion, or 7%,from fiscal 1992 to $24.3 billion.   To further the administration's America 2000 school reformplan, the budget proposes to begin a program of $1 milliongrants to start experimental &quot;New American Schools.&quot; Theadministration hopes to eventually have at least one suchschool in each congressional district.   The budget calls for a 22% increase to $6.6 billion inbudget authority for Pell Grants, the main scholarshipprogram for college students. The average grant would rise54% to $3,700 from $2,400. It also proposes to allow peopleto take an income-tax deduction for interest paid onfederally guaranteed student loans.   -- Hilary Stout                                                                                                                               Employment                                                                                                          The Labor Department budget involves program changes thatmostly indicate level or reduced spending.   Outlays for unemployment benefits would fall 19% to $27.8billion after climbing 21% in fiscal 1992. The jobless-payrise this year includes increased regular benefits because ofthe recession's higher unemployment and two rounds ofextended benefits. President Bush and Congress are on theverge of agreeing to the second round, which would provide$2.7 billion for another 13 weeks of benefits. The projectedfiscal 1993 drop reflects the administration forecast thatthe average unemployment rate will fall to 6.5% in calendar1993 from 6.9% this year.   Job-training and placement programs for dislocatedworkers, disadvantaged youths and others would be revamped,largely to put more emphasis on the use of local groups runby private industry and to create information and counselingcenters in employment offices. Under a &quot;Job Training 2000&quot;initiative, some existing job-training andvocational-education funds would be reprogrammed, but thedepartment's total training budget wouldn't change.Consolidation of operations into fewer ones would produceadministrative savings, freeing more money for trainingoutlays.   The budget repeats proposals that have stalled in Congressbefore. It would combine Job Training Partnership Act summerand youth-training programs into a year-round youth programand create projects to help the most disadvantaged and reduceschool dropouts under a new &quot;Youth Opportunity Unlimited&quot;program. Another plan would substitute new programs for oneinvolving training and allowances for workers who lose theirjobs because of imports.   -- Albert R. Karr                                                                                                                         Environment and Energy                                                                                                          Cleaning up polluted nuclear weapons plants, upgradingsewage treatment in big cities, and expanding and improvingthe nation's parks would highlight environmental spending.   The decline in military-production needs allows the EnergyDepartment to cut spending in this area, including the end ofnuclear production work at the troubled Rocky Flats facilitynear Denver. At the same time, spending on cleanup would rise$1 billion to $4.9 billion. Except for a big rise intransportation technologies, research spending on solar andother renewable energy sources would increase slightly. Andoil and natural gas programs would win substantial boosts.The department is increasing research spending on globalclimate change and conservation programs and acceleratingplans to purchase alternative-fueled vehicles for the federalfleet. Overall, the department's budget outlays would rise to$16.3 billion from $15.7 billion.   Environmental Protection Agency outlays would increase to$6.2 billion from $5.9 billion, with a healthy share of therise going to sewage-treatment grants to major cities.Funding for hazardous waste cleanup under the Superfundprogram and the agency's operating budget would alsoincrease.   Increased spending on parks would finance a big rise in aprogram to create state parks and recreation facilities underthe America the Beautiful program. The budget would alsocontinue a tree-planting initiative, set up a targetedresource-recovery program aimed at specific parks, andincrease the number of park rangers. The InteriorDepartment's overall outlays, however, would fall to $6.6billion from $7.1 billion.   -- Rose Gutfeld                                                                                                                               Foreign Aid                                                                                                          State Department and foreign-aid spending would rise to$20.6 billion from $20.1 billion under President Bush's firstpost-Cold War budget, which reduces security aid andincreases funds for the former Soviet Union and UnitedNations peacekeeping forces.   The budget calls for $180 million in spending forhumanitarian and technical aid for the former Soviet Union'srepublics. This would be the first installment of the $645million in aid Mr. Bush pledged at last week's 47-nationconference to coordinate aid to the republics. Acongressional aide said that &quot;as long as it doesn't come outof domestic money, I assume it will go through.&quot; Thepresident's budget would accomplish this by essentiallykeeping a lid on total international-aid spending.   In addition, $350 million in spending is allocated forU.N. peacekeeping forces. Most of this money would be spenton peacekeeping operations in Cambodia and El Salvador, whichboth recently ended long and bitter civil wars that had beenstoked by the Cold War.   Some of the funds for these programs would come from cutsin security assistance to such nations as Pakistan and thePhilippines, which were important U.S. allies in theideological struggle against communism. Overall securityassistance would decline 3% to $7.4 billion.   -- Robert S. Greenberger                                                                                                                                 Health                                                                                                          Details of the president's long-awaited health-care reformplan aren't included in his budget. Those proposals arelikely to be unveiled next week.   Outlays for the Department of Health and Human Services --which include Social Security and Medicare payments -- wouldtotal $585 billion, about 40% of the entire U.S. budget.   Included in Mr. Bush's budget are substantial increases inseveral preventive health-care and children's programs.Authorization for spending on childhood immunizations wouldgrow 18% to $1.7 billion. Budget authority for breast andcervical cancer screening would rise 24% to $515 million. Asthe president announced last week, he is calling for a $600million, or 27%, increase in budget authority for the HeadStart program for disadvantaged preschoolers, more thandoubling Head Start funding since 1989.   The budget contains a 21% increase, to $7.6 billion from$6.3 billion, for programs that provide primary care. Theseinclude: community and migrant health centers, up 15% to $684million; health care for homeless people, up $12 million to$68 million; the National Health Service Corps, whichprovides physicians' services to underserved areas, up 19% to$120 million.   Biomedical research would grow 2% to $10.6 billion.Research on cancer would rise to $2 billion from $1.98billion; research on heart disease would grow to $772 millionfrom $729 million. AIDS research would grow 4%, to $1.24billion from $1.19 billion.   In addition, Mr. Bush is calling for spending cuts inprograms for immigrants, heating and fuel assistance, andphysical education.   The administration is again proposing to reduce thefederal subsidy -- and raise the premiums -- for wealthyMedicare beneficiaries. Couples with annual incomes of morethan $125,000, and individuals with annual incomes of morethan $100,000, would get only 25% of premiums subsidized,instead of 75%. As a result, they would pay $60 more a month.(A similar proposal last year died in Congress.)   Net outlays for Medicare would grow by $10.7 billion to$129.3 billion. The administration would extract $1.5 billionin savings through proposals that affect payments to labs,anesthesiologists, hospitals and home medical equipmentsuppliers.   -- Hilary Stout                                                                                                                             Law Enforcement                                                                                                          Spending on federal law enforcement would rise 9.5% to$15.4 billion. The major beneficiaries would be the federalprison system, prosecutors' offices and federal judicialoperations.   Federal prisons, which have been expanding rapidly tohandle the larger number of drug criminals receivingmandatory minimum sentences, would receive $2.2 billion, a16% increase. Spending for prosecutors and judges would risea combined 12% to $5.6 billion. That total encompasses civilas well as criminal litigation.   The Justice Department, which oversees spending of most ofthe federal law enforcement budget, would itself receive$10.4 billion, an 11% increase. Attorney General William Barrrecently vowed to devote more federal agents to investigatingviolent street crime, traditionally a state and localconcern.   The administration, however, has proposed to spendslightly less for criminal investigations conducted by theFederal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug EnforcementAdministration and a variety of task forces focusing onorganized crime and money-laundering. The combined fiscal1993 request for these criminal investigative activities is$2.93 billion, down from $2.95 billion in fiscal 1992.   Firearm investigations conducted by the TreasuryDepartment would enjoy a modest increase in funding, as wouldimmigration enforcement programs supervised by both theTreasury and Justice departments.   -- Paul M. Barrett                                                                                                                           Poverty and Housing                                                                                                          The administration is offering several modest proposalsaimed at low-income people. To combat welfare dependency,states could allow families receiving Aid to Families WithDependent Children to keep as much as $10,000 in assets, upfrom $1,000, without forfeiting welfare benefits. The budgetalso proposes expediting procedures allowing states toconduct other experiments in welfare reform.   The Department of Housing and Urban Development is slatedto receive $28.1 billion, an increase of $4 billion. When thecost of maintaining current programs is taken into account,however, the new figure represents an increase of less than1%.   Most significant among new HUD proposals is an initiativeto allow residents in developments owned by public housingauthorities that are designated by HUD as &quot;troubled&quot; to voteto transfer the ownership of the development to a state,city, or nonprofit entity. Termed &quot;perestroika for publichousing,&quot; the program also would allow HUD to transfer vacantpublic housing to nonprofit organizations or the tenantsthemselves. In addition, tenants who receive housingassistance in the form of vouchers would be eligible for thefirst time to apply the funds toward a home purchase.   The budget halves current funding levels for the HOMEprogram, which provides public housing assistance to statesand local governments. But Alfred Delli Bove, deputy housingsecretary, said HUD would increase its request to $950million from $700 million if Congress required state andlocal governments to supplement federal spending for theprogram.   The administration also is reviving last year's failedattempt to consolidate several grant programs into a singlegrant with no strings attached to be awarded to states.Housing programs included in last year's list have beendropped this year at the suggestion of state officials. Thenew list, which represents $14.7 billion in spending,includes money currently earmarked for education for homelessyouth, maternal and child health, drug control, and statewelfare administration.   -- Timothy Noah                                                                                                                            Science and Space                                                                                                          Outlays on overall research and development would grow 5%to $72.9 billion, while spending for defense research wouldrise 4% to $38.8 billion.   In civilian research, the administration proposed newinitiatives in biotechnology, where budget authority wouldincrease 7% to $4.03 billion; and materials processing, whichwould increase 10% to $1.8 billion. The administration alsoproposed a 23% increase for a supercomputer network to $803million-considerably higher than expected.   The administration continues to push a number ofbig-science projects, including the superconductingsupercollider, which would get a 34% increase in authorizedspending to $650 million, and the orbital space station wouldreceive an 11% boost to $2.25 billion.   But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,which has long been a favorite of the Bush administration,would receive only a 2% increase in outlays to $14.1 billion.Spending by the National Science Foundation would increase17% to $2.7 billion.   The administration plans to cancel a $2 billion project tobuild new rocket boosters for the space shuttle and an $800million project to launch a robotic spacecraft to tail acomet.   In defense research, the administration plans cuts innuclear weapons research, development and testing. ThePentagon's budget authority for basic research would increase3% to $1.2 billion, but budget authority for the military'sapplied research and development wouldn't keep up withinflation.   -- Bob Davis                                                                                                                             Transportation                                                                                                          The Transportation Department would increase spending onaviation and highway programs, while reducing aid for masstransit and rail systems. Overall, department outlays wouldedge up to $34.5 billion from $33.4 billion this year.   Expenditures by the Federal Aviation Administration wouldincrease to $8.6 billion from the current $7.94 billion,reflecting higher funding for the FAA's massive effort tooverhaul the air traffic-control system. The administrationalso seeks stepped-up research spending on security, safetyand communications technology.   An additional 150 air traffic controllers and 25 securitystaffers would be hired.   Federal Highway Administration outlays would rise to$17.34 billion from $16.15 billion this year, while spendingfor mass transit would decline to $3.4 billion from $3.75billion. The administration wants to eliminate operatingsubsidies to transit systems in cities with more than 500,000people. The budget proposes higher spending on highways andlower spending on transit than the authorized levels in the1991 transportation bill. Rail funding also would decline,reflecting reduced assistance to Amtrak.   Congress often has blocked administration efforts to curbrail and transit funding. In addition, because of the newflexibility provided in the transportation bill, the transitbudget may be supplemented by as much as $10 billion ofhighway funds, depending on state and local decisions.   The White House abandoned an earlier proposal to transferthe Ready Reserve Force from the Maritime Administration tothe Defense Department.   -- Laurie McGinley   ---          How the Competing Tax Proposals Compare                                                                                                        President Bush                                                                                                          Middle-Class Tax Cut: Increase personal exemption by $500per child   Investment Incentive: 15% first year write-off onequipment purchased this year   Capital Gains: 15.4% rate on assets held for three years   Real Estate: Allows passive loss deduction for thosematerially participating in real estate   Retirement Accounts: $2,500 a year, nondeductible, inIRAs; tax-free earnings   Cost Offsets: Cut government benefit programs                                                                                                        Representative Rostenkowski                                                                                                          Middle-Class Tax Cut: Tax credit of up to $400 for workersfor two years   Investment Incentive: Favors some temporary investmentincentive*   Capital Gains: None   Real Estate: None   Retirement Accounts: None   Cost Offsets: New 35% top rate; 10% surtax on millionaires                                                                                                        Senator Bentsen                                                                                                          Middle-Class Tax Cut: $300 tax credit per child   Investment Incentive: Favors some temporary investmentincentive*   Capital Gains: None   Real Estate: Might support a limited restoration ofpassive loss deduction*   Retirement Accounts: Restore deductible IRAs to upperincome taxpayers; new accounts with tax-free earnings   Cost Offsets: Cut defense spending                                                                                                        Liberal Democrats (Gore-Downey)                                                                                                          Middle-Class Tax Cut: $800 tax credit per child   Investment Incentive: None   Capital Gains: None   Real Estate: None   Retirement Accounts: None   Cost Offsets: New 36% top rate; 15% surtax on highestincomes                                                                                                        Conservative Republicans (House GOP)                                                                                                          Middle-Class Tax Cut: None   Investment Incentive: Increase expense limit for smallcompanies to $18,200 from $10,000   Capital Gains: 15% rate; index gains for inflation   Real Estate: Might support a limited restoration ofpassive loss deduction*   Retirement Accounts: $2,000 a year, nondeductible, inIRAs; tax-free earnings.
