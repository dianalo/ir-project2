On September 12, 1988, the International Trade Commission(``ITC'') found that there is a reasonable indication that imports of steelwheels from Brazil are materially injuring, or threatening material injuryto, a U.S. industry (USUTC Pub. No. 2124, September 1988).On September 6, 1988, we presented questionnaires to Borlem S.A. EmpreendimentosIndustriais (``Borlem S.A.'') and Rockwell-Fumagalli (``Fumagalli''), manufacturersof steel wheels from Brazil. On September 23, 27, October 24, November1, 10, and December 1, 6, 1988, we received replies to the questionnaires.On November 18, 1988, we presented a questionnaire to Borlem do NordesteS.A. Empreendimentos Industriais (``BNE''), a subsidiary of Borlem S.A.We received replies to the questionnaire on December 1 and 28, 1988.On December 12, 1988, the petitioner, Kelsey-Hayes Company, requested thatthe Department extend the period for the preliminary determination untilnot later than 210 days after receipt of the petition in accordance withsection 733(c)(1)(A) of the Act. Verification of the responses was conducted from January 16 through February3, 1989 and on February 8, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(HTS), as provided for in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Trade andCompetitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption on or after that date is now classified solelyaccording to the appropriate HTS item number(s).The products covered by this investigation are steel wheels, assembledor unassembled, consisting of a disc and a rim, designed to be mountedwith both tube type or tubeless pneumatic tires, in wheel diameter sizesranging from 13.0 inches to 16.5 inches, inclusive, and generally for useon passenger automobiles, light trucks, and other vehicles. During theperiod of investigation, such merchandise was classifiable under item under692.3230 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated. This merchandiseis currently classifiable under HTS item number 8708.70.80. The HTS numberis provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written descriptionremains dispositive.In a submission dated September 28, 1988, Borlem S.A., a respondent company,argued that rims imported separately are not within the scope of the investigation.In submissions dated October 7, 1988 and October 12, 1988, the petitionerargued that rims imported separately and sold as ``distinct articles ofcommerce'' are not within the scope of the investigation, but that rimsimported separately as a means of circumvention are within the scope ofthe investigation. In a submission dated October 21, 1988, the petitioner,as well as NI Industries, a domestic interested party, argued that rimsimported separately are within the scope of the investigation.For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have treated rims ordiscs, whether imported separately or together, as included in the scopeof this investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation</ITAG>Sales of steel wheels to original equipment manufacturers (``OEMs'') accountfor more than 60 percent of imports of the subject merchandise into theUnited States from Brazil. Steel wheels are normally sold to OEMs in theUnited States on the basis of long-term requirements contracts. We foundthat shipments to the United States by Fumagalli during the February 1-July31, 1988 investigation period were pursuant to agreements executed in November1986. Therefore, under andSection; 353.38(a) of our regulations, we extendedthe period of investigation for Fumagalli to seven months by includingNovember 1986 as well. See <T3>Certain Forged Steel Crankshafts from Japan,</T3> 52 FR 17999 (1987)and <T3>Certain Granite Products from Italy,</T3> 53 FR 27187 (1988). The periodof investigation for Borlem S.A. and BNE is February 1, 1988 through July31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales of the subject merchandise in the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States pricefor sales of wheels to OEMs with foreign market value for sales of wheelsto OEMs in Brazil. Since there were no viable rim sales in the home marketor third countries, we compared the United States price for rim sales toBNE's sole U.S. rim customer, an unrelated wheel customizer, with a foreignmarket value based on constructed value.Although not expressly required by the Act, the Departmet has a long-standingpractice of calculating a separate dumping margin for each manufactureror exporter investigated. We have concluded, however, that, for purposesof this investigation, Borlem S.A. and BNE are not separate, and that itis appropriate to calculate a single, weighted-average margin for BorlemS.A. and BNE.The administrative record establishes that Borlem S.A. holds over 95 percentof the voting capital and over 73 percent of the total capital of BNE.Since the vice president of Borlem S.A. is the president of BNE and thefinancial director of Borlem S.A. is financial director of BNE, there iscommon access to pertinent sales and manufacturing information. Even thougheach company maintains separate manufacturing facilities and sales operations,the production facilities at both companies consist of similar types ofequipment. Therefore, it would not be necessary to retool extensively eitherplant's facilities before implementing a decision to restructure eithercompany's manufacturing priorities. Given these facts, it would be incorrectto conclude that these entities constitute two separate manufacturers orexporters under the dumping law. See <T3>Certain Granite Products from Spain,</T3> 53 FR 24337 (1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>As provided in section 772(b) of the Act, we used purchase price to representthe United States price for sales of steel wheels made by Borlem S.A. toan unrelated purchaser prior to importation of the merchandise into theUnited States.The Department also determined that purchase price and not exporter's salesprice was the most appropriate indicator of United States price for Fumagallibased on the following elements:1. The merchandise was purchased or agreed to be purchased prior to thedate of importation from the manufacturer or producer of the merchandisefor exportation to the United States.2. The selling agent located in the United States acted only as a processorof sales-related documentation and as a communication link with the unrelatedU.S. buyers.3. The wheels sold to OEMs were made-to-order and not sold through inventory.Although a party related to the seller took title to the wheels and heldthem in its warehouse after the sale was made, this was only to accommodatethe ``just-in-time'' delivery terms stipulated in the requirements contractnegotiated between the Brazilian producer and the U.S. OEM purchaser. Allterms of the sale were settled in this contract and were not changed bythe related party when it released the wheels to the U.S. OEM purchaser.4. Warehousing for ``just-in-time'' delivery was the customary channelof trade for wheels sold by Fumagalli to the U.S. OEM purchaser.We calculated purchase price based on the packed ex-factory prices to unrelatedpurchasers in the United States. Where appropriate, we made deductionsfor brokerage and handling, foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marineinsurance, U.S. duty, and U.S. inland freight. In accordance with section772(d)(1)(C) of the Act, we made additions for indirect taxes not collectedby reason of the exportation of the merchandise.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>We calculated foreign market value for wheel sales by Fumagalli and BorlemS.A. based on home market packed prices to unrelated purchasers in accordancewith section 773(a) of the Act.When basing foreign market value on home market prices, we made deductions,where appropriate, for inland freight, and inland insurance. We deductedthe home market packing cost and added U.S. packing costs. We made circumstanceof sale adjustments for differences in credit, post-sale warehousing expenses,and indirect taxes between the two markets.In accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act, we made adjustmentsto similar merchandise to account for differences in the physical characteristicsof the merchandise where there were no identical products in the home marketwith which to compare products sold in the United States. These adjustmentswere based on differences in the costs of materials, direct labor and factoryoverhead.In accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Act, we used the constructedvalue of the exported merchandise to determine foreign market value forBNE, since no viable home market or third country rim sales were foundduring the period of investigation. The constructed value was based uponthe most recent information submitted by BNE and included adjustments forcalculation errors noted by the company prior to the verification.Section 773(e)(1)(A) of the Act directs that foreign market value shallbe constructed as of the date of exportation. At the same time, however,andSection;353.56(a)(1) of our regulations requires that currency conversionsfor ``purchase price'' transactions be made using the exchange rate ineffect on the date of the U.S. sale.<ITAG tagnum="54">Previous investigations have shown that in hyperinflationary economies,when the date of sale occurs in a month preceding the date of shipment,application of the earlier date of sale exchange rate may result in distortions.Nominal increases in cost between the date of sale and the date of shipmentare accounted for by using monthly replacement costs to construct foreignmarket value; however, the decreased value of the currency, in which thosecosts are expressed, remains unadjusted. </ITAG>In consideration of the above, we calculated foreign market value for BNEusing the exchange rate in effect on the date of sale as prescribed inour regulations. In addition, a circumstance of sale adjustment was madeprior to currency conversion, eliminating the artificial distortion ofvalue caused by the rapid devaluation of Brazil's currency. See <T3>Tubeless Steel Disc Wheels from Brazil, </T3>53 FR 34566 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion </ITAG>When calculating foreign market value, we normally make currency conversionsin accordance with andSection;353.56 of our regulations, using the certifiedexchange rates furnished by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Sincethe Federal Reserve Bank of New York stopped providing exchange rate informationfor Brazil prior to the period of this investigation, we used the monthlyexchange rates provided by the International Monetary Fund. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>The verification was conducted from January 16 through February 3, 1989and on February 8, 1989, using standard verification procedures, includingexamination of relevant accounting records and original source documentsprovided by the respondents. With the exception of BNE, the informationused in reaching the preliminary determination in this investigation wasbased upon data reviewed during our verification. Our verification of BNE's submitted constructed value data was also conductedduring the above stated period. Pending further review of this complexconstructed value data, we have based BNE's preliminary determination uponthe company's submitted constructed value data. The continuing review ofthe verification results and constructed value data may lead to decisionswhich produce results differing from these preliminary results. Our verification reports will be available to all parties for comment shortlyafter publication of this preliminary notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results </ITAG>We preliminarily determine that steel wheels from Brazil are neither being,nor are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair valueas provided in section 733 of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification </ITAG>In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we will notify the ITC ofour determination. In addition, we are making available to the ITC allnonprivileged and nonproprietary information relating to this investigation.We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and proprietary informationin our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not disclose suchinformation, either publicly or under administrative protective order,without the consent of the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.If our final determination is affirmative, then the ITC will determineno later than 120 days after the date of this preliminary determinationor 45 days after the final determination, whichever is later, whether theseimports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a UnitedStates industry. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment </ITAG>In accordance with andSection;353.47 of the Department's regulations, ifrequested within ten days of publication of this notice, we will hold apublic hearing to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment onthis preliminary determination at 1:00 p.m., on April 10, 1989, at theU.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution AvenueNW., Washington, DC 20230.
