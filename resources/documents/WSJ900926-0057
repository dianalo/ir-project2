In fact, they weregetting downright hostile.   Here they stood, wilting in the 100-degree Florida heat ona day dripping with importance for MCA Inc. The company'stouted, $650 million Universal Studios Florida in Orlando washaving its opening, and several major rides didn't even work.The earth wasn't quaking, King Kong wasn't bellowing, and theshark from &quot;Jaws&quot; wasn't snapping at pontoon boats, at leastnot on cue.</LP><TEXT>   One band of sweaty malcontents, having paid full-price $29admission, charged up to the assembled TV cameras, thrustdown their thumbs, and shouted, &quot;We're going to DisneyWorld]&quot;   This was not a high-water mark for public relations, andMCA's chairman, Lew Wasserman, and its president, Sidney J.Sheinberg, weren't pleased. But they had pushed too hard,opening the park in June before it really was ready.   After years of indecision about creating the theme park,and after a decade of missed opportunities, MCA had becomeobsessed with proving itself capable of competing throughoutthe world with Walt Disney Co., Time Warner Inc., Sony Corp.,and News Corp.'s Fox. Yet it may have clung so long to itstraditional Hollywood ways that the only means of achievingthis goal was to be merged or acquired.   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. fills the bill: itsfamiliar brands are marketed world-wide and includePanasonic, Quasar, Technics and National. Reacting to areport in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, MCA announced thatit is talking with a major international company about abuy-out.   People knowledgeable about the talks say the takeoverprice could range from $80 to $90 a share, or about $7.4billion to $8.3 billion. In New York Stock Exchange compositetrading yesterday MCA shares soared $19.50, to close at $54.   People close to the situation say that MCA was in mergerdiscussions with Paramount Communications Inc. several weeksago, but that talks broke off because executives of the twocompanies couldn't come to terms on sharing control.Paramount declines comment but is said to be worried aboutits existing joint ventures with MCA, notably the USA cablenetwork and the international film distributor U.I.P.   It is far from certain that a Matsushita acquisition ofMCA will ever take place. But MCA appears to be &quot;in play,&quot;and other bidding scenarios are possible. One of Matsushita'sappeals for MCA is that it's among the few companies sowealthy it wouldn't have to spin off assets to support theacquisition.   The only required sale would be theU.S.-government-mandated divestiture of MCA's New York-areaTV station WWOR, which Disney and many others would love toget their hands on. The merged company also could spin offthe TV station to MCA shareholders. However the Matsushitatalks turn out, a hostile takeover of MCA isn't likelybecause Mr. Wasserman controls much of the company.   An acquisition by Matsushita might leave MCA's managementintact. That was an issue -- and a stumbling block -- inother talks over the years. A merger would give MCA newinternational heft and more financial resources.   But would MCA stay MCA, with all its current corporatequirks? The botched opening and continued operationalproblems at Universal Studios Florida raise questions aboutwhether a merged MCA would continue to pay for the misstepsof the past. And they lead observers to wonder whether thecorporate culture that served the company well in its earlyyears -- tough, arrogant, inflexible, and, above all,conservative -- is right for the '90s.   &quot;Life is filled with missed opportunities,&quot; aphilosophical Mr. Sheinberg said Monday. &quot;I prefer to lookforward. There's a lot ahead of us that looks optimistic, andI'm generally pessimistic about most things.&quot; He wouldn'tcomment about merger plans.   Even before there was word of the Matsushita talks, changewas afoot in the Black Tower, MCA's cold, black glass worldheadquarters in Universal City, just over a hill from LosAngeles. It was exemplified by Mr. Sheinberg's recentacquisition of Geffen Records for 12.5% of MCA's stock, worthabout $540 million. The deal, which takes effect at year-end,demonstrated that the 77-year-old Mr. Wasserman finally hadpassed leadership of MCA to Mr. Sheinberg, who is likely tostay on should Matsushita actually acquire MCA.   &quot;The Geffen deal was Sid's decision,&quot; says investmentmanager Mario Gabelli, who controls 4% of MCA's stock. &quot;Youdon't make a decision about 10 million shares unless you'rerunning the company.&quot;   The changes at MCA aren't entirely self-generated. Thecompany needed a nudge, and it came last year in the form ofthe multibillion-dollar merger of Time Inc. and WarnerCommunications Inc. &quot;We're a 200-pound gorilla in a game with1,000-pound gorillas,&quot; Mr. Wasserman told one MCAshareholder. &quot;We've got to become a 1,000-pound gorilla, orget out of the game.&quot;   MCA has been at the game a long time. In Hollywood, wheremarquees are continually changing, Mr. Wasserman and Mr.Sheinberg, who is 55, have been the longest-running show intown. Mr. Wasserman, who with the late Jules Stein built MCAfrom a tiny band-booking agency that had its beginnings inthe Chicago of the 1920s, is still treated like a Romansenator at industry functions. Mr. Sheinberg has been Mr.Wasserman's head of operations since 1973. The two still makethe nostalgic trip to Chicago every year for the company'sannual meeting.   Every day Mr. Wasserman and Mr. Sheinberg put on theirdark suits and ties and drive to their grim Black Tower. Abust of Mr. Stein, who died in 1980, stands guard over theelevator bank. He amassed warehouses of English antiques overthe years, and the building still groans with the collection.Even the hippest, high-tech movie executives must toil amidthe hulking sideboards and horse-and-hound prints, whichsuffice as office furnishings while others in Hollywood areforever redecorating.   MCA itself had become a bit musty and creaky. In achanging world, MCA suddenly found itself no longer amarket-leading behemoth but a relatively small player. AndMr. Wasserman, many observers felt, had become rather toopreoccupied with holding onto what he had built. He avoidsthe press and declined to be interviewed for this story. Butthe beauty of the Matsushita deal, individuals close to thesituation say, is that MCA can expand internationally withoutneeding equity partners, and shareholders can be rewardedwithout breaking up the company or sending its managementpacking.   From its Prohibition-era start, MCA grew into a majortalent agency. It represented actor Ronald Reagan, amongothers, in the '50s. Late in the decade it expanded intomovie and television production by buying Universal Studios,which at the time was best known for &quot;B&quot; movies and horrorfilms. Universal eventually became a major supplier ofnetwork TV shows, which generated cash to compensate for thebumpy fortunes of the movie division. They have indeed beenbumpy. On the one hand, Mr. Sheinberg took on an unknowndirector named Steven Spielberg, who went on to produce forUniversal the highest-grossing film of all time, &quot;E.T. TheExtra-Terrestrial,&quot; released in 1982. But the studio alsopassed up the opportunity to produce the 1981 movie &quot;Raidersof the Lost Ark.&quot; It put out the disastrous &quot;Howard theDuck.&quot;   MCA, meanwhile, proved itself resistant to change. Itbitterly fought Sony Corp.'s introduction of the Betamax homevideo recorder. A venture to market a competing videodisksystem that could play back but not record failed toelectrify consumers. And Mr. Sheinberg rancorously opposedthe growing power of pay-cable TV services such as Home BoxOffice, now a Time Warner operation.   At least twice in the past decade, MCA came close tomerging with other entertainment companies, once with thethen-independent RCA Corp., and later with Walt Disney Co.shortly before the current management team took over atDisney in 1984. Both times, questions arose about who wouldcontrol the merged entity -- questions that turned out to beinsurmountable, executives say.   MCA seems to be trying to make up for lost time. In thepast year or so, it has divested itself of its troubled LJNtoy unit; it has taken charge of its ailing 49%-ownedCineplex Odeon theater chain; and it has opened one, at leasttemporarily troubled, theme park. (It is planning to buildtwo more parks, near Paris or London and in Japan.) MCA brokewith tradition to handsomely reward (with millions of dollarsin stock options) Thomas P. Pollock, the architect of itsmovie division's newfound success, and it is finally about tostart developing a long neglected asset, 200 acres ofUniversal City real estate at the junction of two Los Angelesfreeways.   Yet Mr. Wasserman only reluctantly assented to Mr.Sheinberg's strongly argued desire to buy WWOR-TV for $387million. The station, based in Secaucus, N.J., serves the NewYork market. He put a stop to plans to buy a big stake inHasbro Inc., the now struggling toy-industry giant. MCAexecutives stood idly by watching Fox Inc. start a TVnetwork, something MCA might have attempted but didn't.   MCA itself is primarily responsible for current problemswith its Florida studio tour, a vaster version of thecompany's successful California attraction. Theme park chiefJay Stein (no relation to Jules) recommended as early as 1969that a Florida park be built, and MCA acquired land inCentral Florida with that in mind. But Mr. Wasserman, evergloomy about looming recessions and reluctant to take ondebt, insisted on more research and a partner with whom toshare the risk. Meanwhile, Disney opened Walt Disney World in1971, EPCOT Center in 1982 and, finally, Disney-MGM Studioslast year. Little wonder that every time Mr. Stein isinterviewed, his vitriol about Disney bubbles up. A samplecomment re: Walt Disney World -- &quot;Ask the kids. It's arip-off]&quot;   Although Mr. Stein's candor can seem refreshing comparedto Disney's happy-faced facade, some MCA executives contendprivately that his combativeness hurts MCA. Others say it wasarrogance that led the company to open in Orlando before thepark was ready -- and then to charge visitors full price.Executives in Orlando apparently kept assuring the BlackTower in L.A. that attractions would be operational&quot;tomorrow.&quot; Mr. Stein says he was misled by the rides'designers. &quot;We bought a lemon.&quot;   Despite the negative publicity, analysts believe the parkwill be profitable in the long run for MCA and the Britishpartner it ultimately found, Rank Organisation PLC.   MCA's style clearly flows from Mr. Sheinberg. A lankyTexas attorney, he has a hot temper and a legendaryproclivity to sue people. &quot;At MCA, litigation is a profitcenter,&quot; he once boasted. In an industry in which moguls canbe at one another's throats in court then dine together asold friends, Mr. Sheinberg takes things personally. Heresigned from the board of the American Film Institute whenit accepted a contribution from Sony during MCA's bitterbattle seeking to block home video technology as a copyrightviolation.   While Disney executives carefully avoid knocking MCA inpublic, Mr. Sheinberg growled once that Disney was a&quot;ravenous rat&quot; and accused his competitor of stealing MCA'stheme-park ideas. Disney responds subtly. In worshipfulissues of Variety and the Hollywood Reporter honoringUniversal's 50th Anniversary this year, every major studiobut one bought ads.   Mr. Sheinberg's frequent outbursts may also may havecontributed to Universal's failure to license its 1989 slateof films to pay-cable networks, which are a vital source ofrevenue for major studios.   &quot;I'm sick and tired of the process of trying to licensethese films to pay cable,&quot; Mr. Sheinberg groused duringnegotiations earlier this year, calling HBO and Viacom Inc.'sShowtime &quot;a monopoly.&quot; He threatened to take the filmsdirectly to the commercial networks, and, in April, he didsign a precedent-setting deal with CBS Inc. It was a creativesolution, but MCA undoubtedly left millions of dollars on thetable.   Mr. Sheinberg also has conceded that he is attracted toexecutives who can be as ornery as he is. That trait has leddirectly to multimillion-dollar losses from MCA's investmentin Cineplex Odeon, the Toronto company that operates thelargest theater chain in North America.   Mr. Sheinberg looks visibly pained when the subject isbroached. He was drawn to Cineplex's brash young founderGarth Drabinsky, and saw him not just as a protege but almostas a son. Yet Mr. Drabinsky hatched a plot to take overCineplex. It failed, and he was ousted last December, leavingbehind about $600 million in debt. MCA is still picking upthe pieces.   &quot;We found ourselves in a nightmare,&quot; says Mr. Sheinberg,who at the last minute canceled an MCA table at a charityfundraiser for Mr. Drabinsky last year, even though he wasco-chairman of the event. &quot;I'm a victim of Garth Drabinsky'scharms. I'm a big boy, and I have nobody to blame butmyself.&quot; Mr. Drabinsky declines to comment.   TV production, where MCA had been king, has fallen frompast heights. When the bottom dropped out of the TVsyndication market for hourlong dramas several years ago, MCAfell hardest. How could a company create a hot culturalphenomenon like &quot;Miami Vice&quot; -- and wind up losing money whenit went to sell the show to local stations for reruns? Mr.Sheinberg blamed the networks for not paying their share ofproduction costs.   Some in the syndication business were glad to see ithappen. At the annual National Association of TelevisionProgramming Executives convention, for example, MCA had foryears refused to set up shop on the exhibition floor.Instead, station managers would be summoned to a hotel suitefor an audience with MCA program sales people. Now humbled,MCA is down on the floor. Never known for its sense of humor,the TV division is still trying to become a presence in themore lucrative business of producing half-hour comedy shows.   Change still comes slowly to MCA. When Mr. Pollock joinedas president of the motion picture group in 1987, he couldn'tunderstand why Universal, alone among studios, insisted on&quot;firm terms&quot; when it rented films to theaters, refusing toadjust the percentage of ticket sales it keeps according tohow much business the film does.   &quot;Lew made it clear: How else do you know where you stand?&quot;says a now-converted Mr. Pollock. But the practice works wellonly when films are in demand. During this past crowdedsummer, Universal's &quot;The Jetsons&quot; didn't appear in somecities at all because the studio's terms were too tough.   Mr. Wasserman has also been obstinate about compensation.While Disney and Warner executives were making millions onstock options and incentive profit-sharing, MCA executivesmade relatively little.   Former records chief Irving Azoff left for an affiliationwith Warner because MCA wouldn't offer him a piece of theaction even though he had taken the division from a loss of$8 million to operating profits of $60 million in five years.Mr. Azoff was also frustrated because MCA wouldn't let himbuy Motown Records for $61 million (it's worth much more now)or a significant stake in Polygram Records at a bargainprice. &quot;I was a little too entrepreneurial for them,&quot; saysMr. Azoff, &quot;and they were a little too conservative for me.&quot;   The lesson of Mr. Azoff's departure had some effect. MCAsoon broke precedent by offering Mr. Pollock stock optionsvalued at about $7.8 million as a reward for turning the filmdivision around. And the huge Geffen deal was done in lessthan a week.   Such happenings give longtime observers confidence thatMCA is on the move again. And the backing of Matsushita, withannual sales of $44 billion in fiscal 1990, would give MCAtremendous financial clout. &quot;The company seems to beenergized, and it's becoming more opportunistic,&quot; says NewYork investment banker Roy Furman. &quot;They're not as deliberateas they once were.&quot;   MCA is even slowly changing its button-down style. Overthe hill from the Tower, in a funky office on the SunsetStrip, five long-hairs in motorcycle jackets float throughthe waiting room. Upstairs, a slender man in a T-shirt, jeansand sneakers talks on the telephone as papers lie at hisfeet. There is no desk. &quot;Yes, Michael, I love you, too,&quot; hesays soothingly and hangs up.   Who was that? &quot;Michael Jackson,&quot; casually answers DavidGeffen, 47, now MCA's largest stockholder. With his vastnetwork of contacts, Mr. Geffen is already undermining theimperious, steely image of the company.   Mr. Jackson himself is rumored to be thinking of takinghis recording career to MCA/Geffen. Similar rumors aboundabout Bruce Springsteen.   If Mr. Geffen knows everyone in the music business, hisHollywood equal may be Mr. Pollock, 47, a onetimeentertainment industry lawyer who has pushed throughinnovative deals MCA once would have resisted. Strong onrelationships but cost-conscious to a fault, he has indulgedthe desire of box-office draw Arnold Schwarzenegger to dolight comedy roles that cost less to produce than actionfilms do. The successful Schwarzenegger film &quot;Twins&quot; will befollowed by &quot;Kindergarten Cop.&quot; Controversial filmmaker SpikeLee has also found a home at MCA.   Messrs. Geffen and Pollock are joined on an operationallevel by less-visible Charles &quot;Skip&quot; Paul, 41, a former AtariInc. executive who, as president of MCA Enterprises, has beenthe troubleshooter on Cineplex Odeon, the toy companydivestiture and international theme park plans.   Even without a Matsushita takeover, there are some wildcards in MCA's future. While the company itself hasn't beencharged with any wrongdoing, both its record and its homevideo division have been entangled in business deals withreputed mobsters in recent years. The longtime president ofits Home Entertainment Group was dismissed last year afteraccusations were made, based on FBI wiretap affidavits, thathe associated with organized crime figures.   &quot;I hope my grandchildren don't come home from kindergartenand say someone said the mob has infiltrated MCA,&quot; respondsMr. Sheinberg. &quot;Does anybody really think that?&quot;   Mr. Sheinberg has long been coy about impending alliancesor mergers. After reporters rushed to a Los Angeles hotelcatering to Japanese businessmen last year on reports thatSony was in discussions to buy MCA, an amused Mr. Sheinbergshowed up at an industry banquet sporting a Sony button andtold the audience that if coming Universal films weren't bighits, &quot;expect to see me selling closed-out Walkmans on somestreet corner next year.&quot;   Before the news of the Matsushita talks, he said MCA islike an eligible young woman whom lots of people want todate. &quot;We're going to go to some dances,&quot; Mr. Sheinbergadded. &quot;We may even get married.&quot;   ---         MCA's Biggest Business: Universal Movies                                                                                                                     Most of its Hits Are Oldies                                                                                                          Universal's top movies ranked by box office gross inmillions of dollars                                                                                                        TITLE                          GROSS           RELEASE                                                                                                        E.T.                         $367.66             1982 Jaws                          245.00             1975 Back to the Future            208.33             1985 The Sting                     156.00             1973 Smokey and the Bandit         126.73             1977 On Golden Pond                118.71             1981 Back to the Future 2          116.23             1989 American Graffiti             115.00             1973 Twins                         107.37             1988 Animal House                  105.00             1978</TEXT></DOC>
