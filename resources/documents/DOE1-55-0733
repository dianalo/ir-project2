Marginal amounts of crude are produced. Natural gas resourceshave been exploited both on- and offshore, though production amountsto little more than 1 billion cubic meters per year. Domestic hydrocarbonproduction is forecast to decline. Taiwan possesses an estimated 5300mW of exploitable hydropower capacity, of which 2564 mW had been installedby 1986. Taiwan has undertaken a massive program of nuclear power constructionin response to the rapid rise in oil prices during the 1970s. Energydemand has risen an average of 9.0 percent per year since 1954, whilereal GNP has grown 8.6 percent per year. Since 1980, oil has provideda lower share of total energy demand. Oil demand for transport has continuedto grow rapidly. Declining production of domestic natural gas has ledTaiwan to initiate LNG imports from Indonesia beginning in 1990. Coalhas regained some of its earlier importance in Taiwan's energy structure.With declining domestic production, imports now provide nearly 90 percentof total coal demand. Taiwan is basically self-sufficient in refiningcapacity. Energy demand is expected to grow 5.4 percent per year throughthe year 2000. With declining output of domestic resources, energy dependencyon imports will rise from its current 90 percent level. Government policyrecognizes this external dependency and has directed its efforts at diversificationof suppliers. 18 refs., 11 figs., 40 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
