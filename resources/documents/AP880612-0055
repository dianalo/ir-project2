Dukakis, in a speech to the U.S. Conference of Mayors in SaltLake City, lashed out at the Reagan administration's anti-drugprograms, criticizing the president's cuts in the Coast Guardbudget and federal aid to state and local police in light of histough rhetoric on the issue.   ``What we have today is chaos,'' Dukakis said. ``We've got toback up what we say with what we do.''   The Massachusetts governor also met with Democratic mayors andheld a private session with a smaller group of black mayors.   The likely Democratic nominee called for tougher drug laws andstringent sentencing guidelines, but he stopped short of urgingcapital punishment for drug dealers. Bush has criticized Dukakisfor failing to endorse the death penalty for major drug traffickers.   The vice president, meanwhile, delivered the commencementaddress at a predominantly black college in Wilberforce, Ohio,where he told the 275 graduates of Central State University thatthe nation needs a ``positive civil rights agenda.''   Bush added that the policy must go beyond that to ``knock downthe walls of indifference and other barriers that result ineconomic exclusion.''   The certain GOP nominee, responding to reporters' questions,said he would work ``to broaden the base of our party, talk on theissues that I think transcend black, white, American issues thatare out there and are going to appeal.''   Bush, who celebrated his 64th birthday, received an honoraryDoctor of Laws degree from the college. The award was announcedlast year, but Bush was unable to receive it until Sunday, said EdChamness, a spokesman for the university.   In his speech, Bush told the graduates they made it thoughcollege despite ``poverty, broken homes, inadequate schools and thesocial challenges or threat of drugs and violence.''   Dukakis, focusing on the drug issue in his speech to thenation's mayors, said that the war on drugs can be won, ``but wehave to recognize that it is a war, a war of wills, a war ofvalues, a war of confidence and courage and strength.''   Dukakis promised that if elected he would increase federal lawenforcement staffs and federal aid to state and local police. Hedid not provide specifics.   He also said he would issue an executive order prohibiting thepayment of CIA or other government funds to suspected drug dealers,a reference to alleged payments to Panamanian ruler Manuel AntonioNoriega.   ``Never again, never again are you going to bankroll a drugpeddler who is poisoning our society and killing our children,''Dukakis said.   Jesse Jackson, runner-up to Dukakis in the presidentialnomination sweepstakes, appeared to back down from claims that theDemocrats should offer him the vice presidency based on hissecond-place showing.   Asked if in his recent comments he was saying he should beoffered the nomination and then would decide whether to accept it,Jackson said, ``No, I'm not saying that because I do not want topush Mike Dukakis to that point. It's not necessary.''   Jackson, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' said he hasnot made a decision on whether he would accept the vice presidency,but added, ``I believe I've earned serious consideration.''   Jackson backed efforts by his supporters, meeting in Michiganwith other Democrats on the party platform, to include a call forraising taxes on the rich in the proposed plank.   ``We ought to be candid with the American people,'' Jacksonsaid. ``There's no miraculous way of getting out of this budgetdeficit. ... We certainly cannot come out just by collecting theuncollected taxes of Reaganomics. We must collect some exemptedtaxes of Reaganomics.''   Jackson said that President Reagan has given the Republicans ``aparty, now they must pay for the party.''   The Democrats, winding up their weekend meeting, sidestepped thequestion of the federal deficit and whether to call for highertaxes on the rich.   The party regulars did agree to brand South Africa a terroriststate, called for the appointment of a federal drug czar, adoptionof the Equal Rights Amendment, an end to homelessness, expansion ofAIDS research and providing advance notice of plant closings.   ``I found more areas of agreement than disagreement,'' said Rep.William Gray III of Pennsylvania, the drafting panels' chair,following the three-day meeting on Mackinac Island.</TEXT></DOC>
