By a vote of 86-14, the Senate approved an amendment thateffectively kills a provision that would have withheld $300 millionto close the bases until an audit found that the savings fromshutting down the installations would exceed the cost.   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that further cutsin the defense budget by the Democratic-controlled Congress mayforce him to close more bases.   The audit would have been conducted by the General AccountingOffice, the investigative arm of Congress.   ``We're just asking that the comptroller general analyze.Otherwise these bases have no appeal,'' Sen. Daniel Inouye,D-Hawaii, said on the Senate floor in support of the amendment.``There is no Supreme Court. This is the Supreme Court.''   But Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on theSenate Armed Services Committee, argued against undermining thecommission's recommendations, which were approved by formerSecretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci and upheld in the House.   ``If we set a precedent now that you can re-open the package,I'm fearful future commissions won't be as effective,'' Warner said.   The commission, in issuing its recommendation last year,estimated savings of $5.6 billion over 20 years.   Since the commission's announcement last December, lawmakerswhose home-state bases would be affected complained that the panelbased its selection on inaccurate or incomplete data.   Prior to the Senate action, Cheney met on Capitol Hill withlawmakers from Illinois who made a last-ditch appeal to saveChanute Air Force Base near Rantoul, Ill. The session did notchange plans to close Chanute, 120 miles south of Chicago.   ``Given all the demands to redirect dollars from the defensebudget to other areas, I've got no choice but to find ways to closeadditional bases,'' Cheney told reporters the day after SenateDemocrats and the administration reached a tentative agreement toboost President Bush's anti-drug effort by $900 million.   The drug plan requires a cut of about $1.3 billion in thePentagon budget.   On the Senate floor, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., criticized therecommendations made last year by the ``faceless, nameless membersof the commission.''   ``They cooked the books,'' Dixon said, waving a copy of aGeneral Accounting Office report that had found problems in thecommission's report. The GAO is an investigative agency of Congress.   Residents and businesses in several Illinois counties and citiesnear Chanute pooled their money to hire an influential lobbyingfirm to argue for Inouye's measure. The cost for hiring Patton,Boggs and Blow is estimated at about $30,000.   The Senate also was weighing legislation that cuts PresidentBush's request for Star Wars and the Trident 2 missile, but leavesother strategic programs relatively intact.   Among the major provisions of the spending bill are:   _A cut of about $800 million from Bush's $4.9 billion proposalfor the Strategic Defense Initiative in the fiscal year beginningOct. 1. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and fellowRepublican Sen. Pete Wilson of California plan to introduce anamendment to raise the spending level for Star Wars.   _Elimination of all $1.8 billion for procurement of the Trident2 missile and an increase of $70 million to Bush's request of $216million for research and development of the submarine-launchedweapons. The Trident 2 missile suffered two successive failures inundersea test firings one month before the committee action.   _A requirement that $820 million of the $3.7 billion for StarWars be used for research on lasers and particle beams. Sen.Bennett Johnston, D-La., sponsor of the amendment, expressedconcerns that the administration will sacrifice long-term researchon directed energy weapons in favor of a quick deployment along thelines of the ``Brilliant Pebbles'' scheme favored by many in theadministration.   _Provisions similar to those in an earlier authorization bill,with most of Bush's strategic programs left intact, including theMX and Midgetman nuclear missiles and the B-2 stealth bomber. Thespending plan also accepts the president's decision to cancel theNavy's F-14D jet fighter.   _Earmarking $255 million for the Marine Corps to test the V-22Osprey, a vertical-takeoff plane the administration sought tocancel.</TEXT></DOC>
