Northand John M. Poindexter and two businessmen pleaded innocentThursday to charges they ran the Iran-Contra affair as a vastcriminal conspiracy and defrauded the government of $17 million.   One by one, the defendants were called before U.S. DistrictJudge Gerhard Gesell at their arraignment, and asked by courtroomclerk Barbara Montgomery, ``How do you wish to plead?''   ``Not guilty,'' replied Poindexter, President Reagan's formernational security adviser; and North, a top assistant to Poindexter.   ``Not guilty, your honor,'' responded retired Air Force Maj.Gen. Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim, who controlled the moneyand procured the arms for the once-secret Iran-Contra operation.   All four defendants were released on their personal recognizanceand told to report weekly by telephone to a pre-trial agency.Although criminal defendants are often asked to surrender theirpassports, Gesell said he would not impose that condition.   Dressed in conservative business suits, the four men made theirfirst appearance in court since a federal grand jury, convened byIndependent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh 14 months ago, handed down a23-count indictment March 16.   North, retiring as a Marine lieutenant colonel May 1, andPoindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral, embraced before the judgeentered the crowded courtroom.   The defendants are charged with conspiring to defraud the UnitedStates ``by deceitfully ... organizing, directing and concealing''a program of support for the Nicaraguan Contras rebels at a timesuch assistance was banned.   The indictment also said the defendants ``knowingly didembezzle, steal and convert to their own use'' part of the proceedsgenerated by the sale of weapons to Iran.   Although no exact figure was specified in the theft count, itwas reported elsewhere in the indictment that the arms salesgenerated proceeds of some $30 million while the government waspaid only $12.2 million for the weapons.   Gesell set no trial date but said he would hold an early hearingto determine whether evidence gathered by Walsh is free of taintand therefore admissible.   All the defendants except Secord testified before Congress undera grant of immunity from prosecution, preventing Walsh from usingany of that testimony.   Walsh has said FBI agents assigned to his staff made sure thathe wasn't exposed to any new stories involving the hearings orlater developments. As he obtained his independent evidence, hefiled it under seal with the court. Walsh has the burden of provingthat his evidence was not tainted.   ``The court has an independent obligation to determine ...whether the prosecution up to this stage is or is not tainted ...''Gesell said. ``This ought to get resolved and get resolvedquickly.''   Gesell ordered written motions on the taint question to be filedby April 7, and set a preliminary proceeding for April 12. A fullhearing would likely be held later in April, he said.   Walsh pointed out he has hired retired federal judge HerbertStern to argue such motions, and said he was ready to move ahead.   Gesell told the lawyers he would not allow a civil suit arisingfrom the Iran-Contra affair, in which Secord and Hakim aredefendants, to interfere with the criminal case. The civil trialhad been set to begin June 27.   ``It will not go forward,'' Gesell said. ``A criminal case takesprecedence. This case has got to take priority.''   Outside the courtroom, a crowd of demonstrators gathered to showsupport for the defendants. Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, called onPresident Reagan to issue ``an immediate pardon'' of North andPoindexter.   The defendants were met by a mob scene of reporters andsupporters as they left the courthouse.   As Poindexter stood by silently, attorney Richard Beckler said,``We are going to vigorously contest this case with all ourstrength and might.''   North left through a separate door and did not get close toreporters. However, television cameramen and still photographersmobbed his gray limousine as it drove by the building. North wavedand smiled from the car.   Before the arraignments, some 30 supporters of the defendantschanted as Poindexter, the last of the four to enter the building,walked through the front door.   ``God bless you, sir. God bless John Poindexter,'' shouted onedemonstrator.   The group chanted, ``Fund the Contras, not the lawyers'' andwaved signs reading ``Investigate Communists in Congress'' and``$10 Million Witch Hunt.''   ``We're here to support Ollie North. I think he's a man ofaction and a true American citizen,'' said Katie Collins ofArcadia, Calif.   Peter Flaherty, chairman of Citizens for Reagan, said thedemonstrators represented several organizations, including YoungAmericans for Freedom, the National Defense Council and theCoalition for America. He said they wanted to ``show friendship andsupport for Ollie and solidarity with him.''</TEXT></DOC>
