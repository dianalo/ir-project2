Monday, many Federal pilots are angry about the way the merger is being handled.    The conflict is over Federal's plan to integrate Tiger's pilots into Federal's all-important pilot-seniority list, instead of adding the new aviators to the bottom of the roster. The issue has so infuriated some Federal pilots that at least one lawsuit has been filed, and many Federal pilots are talking about unionizing -- a move Federal's chairman, Frederick H. Smith, fiercely opposes.    The stakes of the pilot-management dispute are high. The seniority list determines pilots' work schedules, the type of airplanes they can fly, their pay and even their career options. The pilots, of course, help determine the success or failure of Federal Express.    &quot;It's basically grow-up time for people at Federal Express who've long called Fred Smith 'father,'&quot; says Michael Cosner, a DC-10 captain who has been with Federal for 16 years. &quot;We're not talking about the old Federal Express. This is the new Federal Express.&quot;    A spokesman for Federal Express declined to comment on the dispute. In March, however, Mr. Smith made clear that he doesn't welcome unions at Federal Express. Asked about the fact that Tiger's pilots are members of the Air Line Pilots Association, Mr. Smith said: &quot;I don't intend to recognize any unions at Federal Express.&quot;    The pilots may make that difficult. After the merger, Tiger's unions are expected to be decertified because Federal's 50,000 nonunion workers far outnumber Tiger's 6,500 employees. But each company has roughly the same number of pilots -- Tiger has 1,000 aviators, Federal 1,100 -- so a unionization vote by pilots only could be close. And now, an increasing number of Federal Express pilots say they are receptive to the idea of a union.    &quot;If a union vote were held tomorrow,&quot; said Richard Sowers, a Federal pilot with five year's seniority, &quot;85% to 90% of the pilots would vote union.&quot;    Last month, Mr. Sowers filed suit against Federal Express in federal district court in Reno, Nev., claiming the company's promise to integrate Tiger's pilots in Federal Express's seniority list violates his employment contract. According to the suit, provisions of the contract, embodied in a document called the Flight Crewmembers' Handbook, expressly guarantee that any pilots acquired in a merger will be added to the bottom of Federal Express's seniority list.    Just days after Mr. Sowers filed that suit, according to other Federal Express pilots and a second suit filed by Mr. Sowers, the company revised the Flight Crewmembers' Handbook to allow it to integrate the new Tiger pilots into the Federal list. The second suit charges that Federal made those revisions improperly because the pilots refused to participate in formulating the changes in a manner set out in the pilots' handbook. Federal Express declined to comment on the charges.    The Federal Express spokesman also wouldn't say whether the company views the Flight Crewmembers' Handbook as part of pilots' employment contracts.    Several Federal Express pilots said they expect the company -- stung by the internal criticism and skittish about driving pilots to unionize -- will maintain two separate seniority lists for a while. Eventually, Tiger pilots can insist on arbitration if they're unsatisfied with a company-drawn list.    In any case, several Federal pilots said the issue may have already badly eroded the loyalty of Federal's pilot force. The non-unionized crews have been widely credited with helping make the overnight carrier a success by flying through hoops to deliver the goods on time.    The conflict also has the potential of creating dangerous tension among colleagues. On a recent stop in Sacramento, Calif., Mr. Cosner, the DC-10 captain, chatted with a Tiger crew on the tarmac, but no one dared broach the seniority issue, he said.    &quot;I may be flying with those guys some day,&quot; he said. &quot;That's the last thing you want is animosity in the cockpit.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
