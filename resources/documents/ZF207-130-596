Thesolution: interactive graphics.andP;  At Edwards, flight-test data isevaluated with emphasis on: seeing and interacting with graphicson a screen; printing from a screen to printers or plotters; useof graphics and alphanumerics on the same terminal; microcomputeraffordability; and accessibility of terminals for all flight-teststaff.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     United States.
