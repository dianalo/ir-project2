This also lowers the detection limit ofthe dosimetry system. We have developed an image analyzer program thatcan more efficiently determine the track density and track-size distribution,as well as read the laser-cut identification numbers on each foil. Thisnew image analyzer makes the routine application of track-size distributionson CR-39 foils feasible. 2 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
