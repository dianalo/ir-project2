Rostenkowski and subcommittee Chairman Sam Gibbons (D., Fla.) offered substitute legislation that was significantly softened to meet objections by the Reagan administration. The new version would give the president more discretion in resolving trade disputes than the measure introduced earlier this year.    Among amendments approved yesterday was one requiring the president to give preference to tariffs over quotas if he decides to retaliate against other countries for unfair trade practices.    Some Democrats who want the legislation to take a &quot;get-tough&quot; posture plan to offer amendments today. </TEXT></DOC>
