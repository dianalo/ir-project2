One was the widow of an Austrian soldier who fell fighting for the German army at Stalingrad in World War II. The other's husband died fighting in the Austrian resistance against the Nazis.    &quot;It was a classic clash of two worlds. Both ladies insisted their husbands were the true heroes and had done their duty,&quot; says Mrs. Huemer, a psychologist and organizer of a vigil last June outside Vienna's cathedral to honor the Austrian resistance. &quot;It's amazing how much pent-up emotion there is.&quot;    Fifty years to the week after the Anschluss, the 1938 Nazi takeover of Austria, Austrians are immersed in a memorial-year flood of books, plays, films, exhibits and a television series confronting them with their long-suppressed wartime past.    The controversy surrounding Kurt Waldheim has deepened and complicated the nation's soul-searching. Last month, a commission concluded that Mr. Waldheim, elected president in 1986, had been far closer to Nazi atrocities than he has acknowledged. Demands that he resign, coupled with denunciations of Austria, polarized the nation.    While nearly 50% of Austrians surveyed say the memorial year further divides the nation, young people flock to lectures and demand Holocaust studies, synagogues are being renovated and vigils held, and newspapers run sections on the Anschluss. Austria was both &quot;victim and perpetrator of Nazism,&quot; says historian Erika Weinzierl.    When 250,000 Viennese greeted Austrian-born Adolf Hitler a few days after German troops marched unopposed into Austria in March 1938, pictures of the event flashed around the world. But untold thousands remained home in fear and despair. If a planned plebiscite on Austria's independence had taken place, many historians believe Hitler would have gotten only 30% of the vote. Nor were all who cheered Hitler Nazis; many simply longed for union with stronger Germany.    After a rigged referendum that gave Hitler 99.7% of the vote, Austria was integrated into Germany. Austrians took part in the Holocaust, denouncing Jews, confiscating their property and sending them and others to concentration camps.    Austria lost 35,000 people in the resistance, 200,000 in combat and 65,000 murdered Jews. After the war, a coalition of the two main parties and a partnership of business and industry helped to create a stable democracy. Overt Nazi organizations were forbidden, 500,000 former Nazis were disfranchised until 1949 and of 60,000 Nazis investigated, 34 were executed.    But critics say real de-Nazification never took place. &quot;Playing the role of the victim, Austria blamed Germany for Nazism. It never had a deep feeling of shame,&quot; says political scientist John Bunzl. Indeed, in 1949 the parties vied for the votes of the half-million former Nazis by bowing to anti-Semitic, German-nationalist tendencies.    Many students learned history as if the Austrian role in World War II never existed. A 1983 study of high-school pupils found that 18% blamed the Jews for the Holocaust.    Even so, many Austrians today seem eager for enlightenment. A highly praised TV series on Austrian history regularly draws as many as two million viewers. &quot;It's not a question of collective guilt but of . . . Austria freeing itself of the historical burden by standing up and admitting it was all wrong,&quot; says Paul Grosz, head of Vienna's Jewish community.    The process is painful and risks renewed outbursts of anti-Semitism. Just a few days ago, vandals smeared a Vienna statue to Nazi victims with a swastika. Doron Rabinovic, a spokesman for Jewish students, says many Jews who &quot;were under the illusion that Austria was somehow different from before&quot; are now thinking of leaving. Vienna's pre-war community of 200,000 Jews numbers 6,000 today.    In many ways, Kurt Waldheim has come to embody Austria's conflicts over its past. The furor over whether he should resign forced him to cancel plans to speak at the Anschluss events, underlining deep divisions between his conservative backers and the Socialists.    Mr. Waldheim refuses to step down, citing his responsibility as an elected representative. Yesterday, he apologized for &quot;the Nazi crimes committed by the Austrians&quot; and pledged to work for improved public morality. But recent polls indicate he no longer commands an electoral majority. &quot;Austrians are not jingoists at any price,&quot; says Christian Haerpfer, head of the Vienna-based Institute of Conflict Research. &quot;They see he's bad for the country, a kind of political AIDS.&quot;    Western leaders have kept clear of Austria since he was elected, just as Austria is seeking to cement ties to the West. Exporters talk of a &quot;Waldheim discount&quot; necessary to sell their products.    &quot;Earlier we were associated with the 'Sound of Music,'&quot; says Anton Pelinka, a political scientist at the University of Innsbruck. &quot;Now we're a Naziland. . . . Both stereotypes are ridiculous.&quot;    Clearly many Austrians would prefer Mr. Waldheim to take the initiative. If he goes, says one politician, &quot;there will be a big sigh of relief.&quot;    Not everyone agrees. Some fear his departure would bury but not resolve bigger problems. Says Mrs. Huemer, the psychologist: &quot;People will not change just because Waldheim resigns. What we need is an ongoing discussion about the past.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
