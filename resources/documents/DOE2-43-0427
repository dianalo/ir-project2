According tocurrent methodologies prescribed for design basis accidents (DBAs),adose is calculated which in reality is based on societal effects ratherthan on the effects on a selected individual. Variation of the releasepattern may therefore result in a lower calculated dose for DBAs, whereasthe risk for a selected individual (e.g. the probability of dying asa consequence of the event) increases. Probabilistic risk assessmentsdetermine either the frequency of severe plant conditions (e.g. coremelts) or directly the societal effects (number of early and late deaths).For a given release the resulting dose to a selected individual willdepend on the weather conditions, including the wind direction at thetime of the release. Above the linear range of low doses, the probabilityof dying as a consequence of dose is S-shaped. Only if doses always remainwithin the linear range can the summation for various weather conditionswith respect to a selected individual be simplified. If it is furtherassumed that the individual is at one fixed location, long term atmosphericdispersion coefficients may be used to calculate the long term averagedose, which is then proportional to risk. If doses in the non-linearrange cannot be excluded, the consequence with regard to a selected individualhas to be calculated for each weather condition and each event and hasto be multiplied by its probability of occurrence. Finally, this canbe summed up in order to obtain the risk. For persons living in the mostunfavourable sector (main wind direction) the results of the calculationspresented include beyond design accidents as analysed in Phase A of theGerman Risk Study.
