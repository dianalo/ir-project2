(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Steeves, Gary V.; Gibson, Douglas J.; Shoreman, Robert.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>LETTERSandM;QUESTIONING HP'S NUMBERSandM;I really think someone should get the facts straight, especially when anarticle is designed for front-page exposure.andP;  According to a page 1 articlein the Jan. 15 issue, &quot;HP Launches RISC System Onslaught,&quot; the HP 870S/200will have the capacity to support 256 users and will be 27 percent lessexpensive and more than twice as powerful as the uniprocessor VAX 9000 Model210.andP;  Based on the stated price in your article of $689,000, the cost peruser is $2,692.andM;Our debt collection application, which uses multiple RMS index files andDEC's FMS (Forms Management System) and which is highly CPU and I/Ointensive, easily supports 70 users on a MicroVAX 3900.andP;  We at GWA fullyexpect that this system will support the 100-plus user range comfortable.andO;This is at the 3900's 3.8 VAX units of processing (VUPs).andP;  If we extrapolateout to the 30-VUP range, and with the faster bus speed of the VAX 9000 Model210, we should reach capacity as we approach 800 users.andP;  Let's say my numbersare off the mark by 20 percent.andP;  If we are just talking about the CPU itselfat a cost 27 percent higher than what was stated in the article, with 640users the cost per user is about $1,368.andP;  The same similarities can be formedusing the other processors mentioned in the article.andM;As we all should know, comparing MIPS and VUPs is like comparing apples andoranges and, in actuality, for 27 percent more in price, the VAX will providenearly three times the performance.andP;  I will stick with the VUP!andM;Gary V. Steeves President GWA Information Systems Inc. Waltham, Mass.andM;DR asked Hewlett-Packard officials if they would like to comment on Steves'letter.andP;  The company's response follows.andM;The number of users published for the HP 9000 Model 870S/200, and the othersystems introduced on Jan. 10, was the &quot;typical&quot; number of users.andP;  Themaximum number of users that the Model 870S/200 supports is 800.andP;  Thus, thesystem will be capable of supporting the 640 users Stevens mentions, and theactual cost per user is $1,076--or $292 (27 percent)--per user less than thisextrapolated calculation.andM;HP agrees that a MIPS or VUP performance comparison is not ideal.andP;  MIPS andVUPs, primarily measure processor power, not necessarily the throughput thata user will see.andP;  Because cross-vendor comparisons are often difficult, HP isfully supportive of a common standard in industry benchmarks such as TPC-A(Transaction Processing Council-Benchmark A).andM;In fact, we were the first company to publish TPC-A benchmarks on our new HP3000 multiuser computers.andP;  We will be publishing TPC-A benchmarks for the HP9000 family this spring.andP;  DEC, IBM and others also serve on this benchmarkscommittee.andP;  We encourage these vendors to begin using the TPC-A benchmarks,so customers will be able to make a more accurate systems comparison.andM;Douglas J. Gibson Product Line Manager Hewlett-Packard Co. Cupertino, Calif.andM;MAFIA METHODS DENOUNCEDandM;I was appalled to read an article, &quot;Best-Kept Secret of My Success: MafiaMethods,&quot; on page 3 in the Jan. 15 issue.andP;  You are supposed to be--Ithought--a responsible voice for our industry, using the power of the pressto freely express those thoughts and ideas that reflect the manycontroversial issues that come before us.andM;Let's get serious, guys! Quoting Hector DeVilla's spokeswoman, the articleclearly denounces &quot;wise guy&quot; tactics, but then goes on seemingly to advocateundercutting rivals in pricing to eliminate competition, fixing prices andcreating webs of indebtedness.andP;  These actions, while not underworld acts ofviolence, may very well be in violation of either criminal or civil U.S.andO;antitrust laws.andM;Further, it seems to me that McDonald's, perhaps the most successfulfranchise corporation in the free world, might take umbrage at being comparedto elements of organized crime, as it is one section in DeVilla's report.andP;  Asfor the section that advises on not being overly dependent on one productline, I think many would agree that this a prodent business posture for anycompany and is not unique to the activities of organized crime.andM;I acknowledged DR's right to express in print anything you wish, and you evenmay have thought that this article was cute.andP;  I would characterize it asfoolhardy.andM;Robert Shoreman President Digital Dealers Association Chelsea, Mich.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
