There were no obvious signs of the activism that marked lastspring's pro-democracy movement in which thousdands of studentsboycotted classes and put up posters to press demands for reform.   Instead, students on the campuses of Qinghua University and theChina People's University appeared to be occupied by by renewing oldfriendships and rushing to classes.   In April and May students demanded the ruling Communist Partyimplement reforms, including press freedom. But in June authoritiesresponded with a military crackdown in which at least 200 people,and perhaps several thousand, were killed. A wave of nationwidearrests followed.   Since then, officials have taken measures to gain control overthe unruly student population.   At Beijing University first-year students will be required toundergo a year of military training and ``cultural studies'' beforebeginning academic work, officials announced. Previously studentshad to take only two weeks of military training.   And universities throughout China have reinstated politicaleducation, which had been largely ignored in recent years.   Most students went home for summer vacation in June, butgraduating seniors were required to sit through several weeks ofpolitical education and write essays of ``self-criticism'' beforereceiving their diplomas.   On the campuses, which in the spring were rife with politicalbroadcasts and discussions, pro-democracy posters plastered ondormitories have been scraped off. Bulletin boards now carry a fewadvertisements and class announcements.   On Monday, the few students who lingered outside their dorms weresubdued and cautious. ``Everything's just fine here,'' said oneyoung woman. ``No problems.''   Upperclassmen at most universities in Beijing will return tocampus by early September. First-year students will begin theirstudies about a month later.   Beijing universities that led the student movement have had theirfreshman enrollments cut by half or more. Nationwide, the number offirst-year students has been cut by 30,000 to 610,000.   Officials have arrested at least seven of 21 Beijing Universitystudents sought for involvement in the spring protests. At least twohave fled the country.</TEXT></DOC>
