From now on, the glass, fiber optics and lab servicescompany will add its name to pots, pans and dishes sold underthe brand names Pyrex, Revere, Visions, Corelle andCorningware.</LP><TEXT>   The company says a recent study shows that most peopledon't know Corning makes those brands-not even Corningware.&quot;Sad but true,&quot; says Charles Piefer, general manager ofconsumer products for the U.S. About half those surveyed saidthey would feel better about those products if the Corningname were attached. The flip side: about half don't care.   But the Corning name may not be enough, since today'shomemakers don't consider Corning fashionable or exciting. Tofix that, Corning is launching a $10 million television andprint advertising campaign to promote itself as something foreveryone, including &quot;finicky aunts,&quot; &quot;cynical daughters&quot; and&quot;radical nephews.&quot; The account will be handled by D'ArcyMasius Benton andamp; Bowles Inc. of New York. Previously, theconsumer products account was shared by DMBandamp;B and GreyAdvertising Inc. Grey still does some internationaladvertising for Corning.</TEXT></DOC>
