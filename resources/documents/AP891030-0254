But memories linger...   Sound like the plot for a TV movie?   It's actually the plot for television itself, advertising and TVexecutives say, as shows like ``The Golden Girls'' draw bigaudiences and stars like Bob Newhart, Andy Griffith, AngelaLansbury and Carroll O'Connor shine.   ``The audience is getting older,'' said David Poltrack, CBSsenior vice president for planning and research. ``The majorpopulation shift is the aging of the baby boomers. When they wereyoung television was very youth-oriented.   ``Gradually, the television networks are recognizing that theadvantage is to go with this aging baby boomer generation.''   Johnny Carson, at 64, is still the most popular talk show host.And when CBS' ``Lonesome Dove'' bowled over the competition lastspring with aging Texas plainsmen Robert Duvall and Tommy LeeJones, ``Perry Mason'' took the case and saved NBC from disaster.The Raymond Burr role appeals mainly to older viewers.   While the population is aging and older people have moredisposable income, advertisers are slow to recognize the changes.   ``We don't go as far as CBS would like us to go,'' said BetsyFrank, a vice president of Saatchi andamp; Saatchi, the world's largestad agency. ``CBS has always been more successful when it programsfor a more mature audience. Even ABC is making some concessionstoward older audiences. Its `ABC Mystery Movie' has older stars andshould do well with older viewers on Saturday night. But FoxBroadcasting has succeeded by targeting a very young audience.''   Nonetheless, Frank sees a shift to buying demographics of age25-54.   Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, agrees theaudience is aging and has more money, ``but you also have to lookat consumer habits.   ``Is the person who is 61 years old who's bought Maxwell HouseCoffee for 40 years really a good target for your new Vienna Roast?I recognize that they have more income but I would be careful abouttheir buying habits.   ``Our standard approach is to come up with a good show that hasas widespread an appeal as possible. `Golden Girls' is a show thatrecognizes the graying of America but it's universal in its appeal.It attracts teen-agers and young people as well. It defiesadvertisers who thought it would be a show that would appeal toonly people over 50.''   Tartikoff believes older viewers will be more of a factor in the1990s.   ``The phenomenon of shows about older people is quite new totelevision,'' said Michael Dann, a consultant who formerly headedprogramming at CBS and NBC. ``We always had older people in familyshows, but the shows were always about kids and their problems.What you have now are shows built around the problems that olderpeople face. The remarkable thing about `The Golden Girls' is thatits audience cuts through all age groups. One show is a hit, two isa trend. You clearly have that taking place today.''   The problems older characters face aren't geriatric. They're theusual mix of romance, sex, appearance, divorce, and the conflictsof human nature.   Although favorable demographics is still the preferred method ofadvertiser selection, audience size is important and becoming moreso, Dann said. ``Years ago I personally canceled Jackie Gleasonwith a 37 share and Red Skelton with a 36 share. You won't find atelevision executive doing that today.   ``Things are so competitive today with new delivery systems anda fourth network that it's difficult to get a large rating for anew show. I don't know of anybody today who would cancel a showwith a 30 share.''   Poltrack said Fred Silverman has become adept at producing hitshows that appeal to older viewers. ``In the Heat of the Night,''``Matlock,'' ``Jake and the Fatman,'' and the ``Perry Mason''movies all have older stars. ``The Father Dowling Mysteries'' wasdropped by NBC but has been picked up by ABC.   In the new season, CBS' ``Island Son,'' ``Snoops,'' ``Wolf,''``Major Dad'' and ``Peaceable Kingdom'' are aimed at older viewers.So are ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' and NBC's ``The Nutt House,''``Hardball'' and ``Mancuso FBI.''   Movies and miniseries also lean heavily toward the olderaudience.   ``The networks are sticking with stars and shows that haveworked in the past,'' said Frank. ``It's not that we're seeing thegraying of television. What we're seeing is each networkconcentrate more on the things they do best. Because older viewersdo watch more television, you may be seeing more older stars thatappeal to that audience.''   Poltrack contends that the network trend toward more news andreality shows is based on more than just the fact that such showsare less expensive.   ``When people pass 40 they become more interested in news andinformation-based shows. The networks are losing audience tocompetitors but the news and information shows are stable. You'llsee more of these shows in the 1990s.''   A dissenter is Paul Schulman, media buyer for 14 big companiesrepresenting $175 million in network ads. ``I think `The GoldenGirls' was a phenomenon in itself and all the imitations will bitethe dust quickly. When you buy time on shows that appeal to olderpeople you pay for an enormous waste of circulation. ``Young peopleare still the key to high prices on a network. The most expensiveshow on TV today is `Cheers' because of its enormous appeal to the18-49 audience. `The Cosby Show' has a higher rating, but itattracts a large number of kids. The aim of every networkprogrammer is to get another `Cheers' or `Roseanne.' At CBS,`Wiseguy' doesn't get a big rating but that's the show all theadvertisers ask for because of its young demographics.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Nov. 2</NOTE></DOC>
