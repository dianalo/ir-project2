 The Chinton's innovation is the unit's scanning head located ina 'pod' suspended about nine inches above the centre of its A4-sized scanningarea -- giving the scanner the look of a trendy photographic enlarger.andP;  Fromthis vantage point, a hinged mirror inside the suspended pod is progressivelyangled to sweep an image of the scan area across the scan head.andP;  Theseparation of scan head and scan, bed lets the Chinon scan under ambientillumination -- avoiding the conventional practice of illuminating thesubject with red light, which can produce difficulties when scanning colouredmaterial.andM;Another bonus is that the Chinon automatically senses the level of ambientillumination and adjusts exposures accordingly.andP;  This makes it good atscanning 3D objects, because they compensate for reflections which otherwisewould 'white-out' the scanned image.andM;Setting up the DS-3000 and its software was not a difficult process.andP;  Thegood documentation describes how to set the easily accessible externaldip-switches for serial or parallel operation and how to install and set upthe scanning software.andP;  Two scanner control programs are supplied: the firstfor use with ATs and 386s and the second more suited for use with slower8088/6-based PCs.andM;Both control programs have identical user interfaces, allowing the user toselect scan resolutions from 75-300 dpi: the .PCX, TIFF, compressed TIFF, or.IMG graphicl file formats; the area to be scanned; text or graphic (greyscale) scanning and whether the image is to be reversed contrast.andP;  Once theparameters are set, hitting Return starts the entire process -- the onlyadjustment you have to worry about is the rotary contrast control.andM;Used in serial mode, information is sent to the PC at rates up to 19,200 baud-- at this rate it takes over three minutes to scan an A4 page at 300dpi.andO;Using the optional parallel card (pound sterling 199), scanning the sameimage takes about 30 seconds -- almost seven times as fast.andM;The Chinon scan control program doesn't offer any paint or imagemanipulations facilities.andP;  It does allow you to select an area smaller thanA4 for scanning, and also to preview an image as it is being scanned.andP;  Myinitial tests were of scans of A4 pages containing line drawings and textsaved in PCX format.andP;  Here it was later possible to obtain good andacceptable quality printed output via Ventura v1.1.andM;My second tests were of the Chinon's capability to scan photographs using itsgraphics mode.andP;  The test photographs were fine when scanned in the Clinton'sgraphics mode -- but it proved to be impossible to eliminate chequer boardinterference patterns from the background when printed via Ventura v1.1.andM;Similar problems -- though less severe -- occurred when the graphic fileswere printed out using PC Paintbrush.andP;  Despite considerable effort trying tojuggle printout sizes, I was never able to obtain satisfactory qualityprinted reproduction of my test photographs.andM;MitsubishiandM;SP-MH216AFandM;The Mitsubishi SP-MH216AF scanner is a neat bit of design and engineeringwork.andP;  The scan unit has a scan width of eight and a half inches, can eitherbe used by hand or with the optional motorized paper feeder.andP;  The paperfeeder and scanner slot together to give a unit requiring little desk space.andM;Connection to the host PC is by a full-length parallel card and the system isdriven by a control program.andP;  This allows you to select between text/line artor halftone resolution scanning; between black or white or reserved scanpolarity and between 3, 5, 7 or 8.5-inch scan widths with 5, 8.5,11 or14-inch scan lengths.andM;When used as a hand scanner, you select the scanning parameters and then tryto move the scanner as steadily as possible over the target document whiledepressing the conveniently placed scan button on the scan unit.andP;  Scanningstops when you have moved the unit the selected scan length.andM;Used in this way, the SP-MH216AF has a very positive feel and isdirectionally stable, although you may have to repeat about 20 per cent ofscans because of discontinuities in the scanned image.andM;As might be expected, the motorized drive unit makes the scanning processvery simple indeed.andP;  Once the scan parameters have been set, a button pushstarts the drive which glides the document under the scanning head.andM;The scanner's control program gives the choice of saving a scan in .PCX, TIFFand .ATX formats.andP;  Although the program does not have any paint capability,it has some very useful image editing/manipulating features.andP;  You can rotatea page right or left 90 degrees; flip an image around a vertical orhorizontal axis; define an area to save or delete, or delete outside; invertan image and also rotate the page angle in case you have scanned an image onthe skew.andM;Scanned outputs is at a resolution of 200dpi (1,780 dots horizontally), andlong scans can require a lot of memory for processing.andP;  Here, theMitsubishi's control program automatically uses any available expanded memoryand and also the hard disk as a buffer if it runs out of expanded memory.andM;While scanning my text and line-art documents, the only difficultyencountered was in scanning figures containing fine vertical lines; theMitsubishi's 200dpi resolution did not perform as well as the 300dpi ChinonDS-3000.andP;  To optimize scans of figures containing fine vertical lines, theMitsubishi's contrast contol had to be adjusted carefully to give maximumcontrast without including any spurious spotting on clear areas of thefigure.andP;  Once optimal scanning contrast had been determined there were noproblems in storing the images in .PCX format and then using Ventura v1.1 tosize the images and print them out.andM;I had severe problems using the Mitsubishi to scan my test photographs.andP;  Forits halftone scans, the control program processes the scanned image bymanipulating successive 4 column by 4 row blocks of dots and adjust therelative density of black and white dots to give an appropriate grey scale.andO;Here, I never achieved a scanned image that was worth trying to print.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
