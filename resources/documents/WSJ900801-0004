Rejuvenation &quot;isn't amatter of selling a single product.&quot;   Shortcomings with the initial version of dBASE IV,introduced nearly two years ago, forced Ashton-Tate topromise delivery of a revamped version. But the revisionsproved so difficult to make that last year the companystopped predicting when it would finish the job. Even now thecompany will only say the product has been &quot;thoroughlytested.&quot; Users who have tested it say it is reliable.   &quot;Unlike {the first} dBASE IV, this one is going to work asadvertised,&quot; said Michael Masterson, president of the SiliconValley dBASE Users Group. The program is a programmableapplication that stores and retrieves data according to theuser's requirements.   Ashton-Tate plans to give a free copy of the new versionto every registered owner of dBASE IV, which lists for $795.The company yesterday also released a version of dBASE to runon minicomputers made by Digital Equipment Corp., which plansto offer the product with its machines.</TEXT></DOC>
