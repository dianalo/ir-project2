The legislation, part of the EC's Social Charter, coverscross-border subcontracting, in which workers are hired ortransferred between EC nations. The proposal is aimed atworkers and companies in the EC but also affects employeesbrought in from outside the community.   Subcontracting is most common in the services sector,especially the construction industry. The commission expectsthe practice to grow with the elimination of trade barriersafter 1992, as companies forge EC-wide links and the servicessector opens to greater competition.   Without EC legislation, companies could use subcontractingto undercut wage levels and conditions set by law orcollective bargaining agreements in EC nations. Suchso-called social dumping could give companies an unfairadvantage against rivals and undermine the EC's aim ofcreating a single market that benefits workers as well asindustry.                                                                                                          ENTREPRENEURS BENEFIT CAMBODIA                                                                                                          Cambodia's revenue from 10 factories has increased tenfoldsince they were leased to entrepreneurs in 1989, indicatingfree-market reforms begun by the Communist leaders havebenefited one of the world's poorest nations. The governmentthis year got $1.7 million from leasing the factories thatproduce milk, liquor, batteries, soft drinks, cigarettes,flour, plywood and other goods. The state recently leased twotextile mills in Phnom Penh, bringing to 12 the number ofprivately run factories in the capital.                                                                                                          ITALIAN REAL ESTATE VALUES                                                                                                          In a bid to plug a big hole in this year's tax revenue,Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti said revaluation ofcorporate real estate assets would be made mandatory. Romehad budgeted to receive 12 trillion lire ($8.99 billion) froma voluntary revaluation by corporations of their fixedassets. So far, the government has got only about 2 trillionlire, as few companies have chosen to use tax advantagesattached to the revaluation. The government's shortfall isundermining its longer-term economic objectives.                                                                                                          AUSTRALIAN MINING BAN BACKED                                                                                                          Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke won overwhelmingsupport from Labor Party members of parliament for hiscabinet's decision to ban mining at Coronation Hill, anaboriginal sacred site. The lawmakers endorsed Mr. Hawke'sstand, defusing speculation the lawmakers' caucus wouldtrigger another challenge to his leadership. The miningindustry contends the ban jeopardizes future resources-sectorinvestment.                                                                                                          EC INSURANCE ACCOUNTING RULES                                                                                                          European Community ministers approved legislation for oneset of accounting standards for insurance companies acrossthe EC, effective in 1995 if member states put it into law.Insurers will value assets at current, rather thanhistorical, value. Disclosure standards will be established.Shareholders and policyholders will be able to compareinsurers' financial positions, now impossible as assets arevalued under varying criteria.

Mr. Abe, who was a top contender to succeed Prime MinisterToshiki Kaifu when his two-year term as LDP president expiresin October, died May 15. A tug of war ensued over thefaction's leadership because of its potentially big influencein the LDP presidential election. With its majority in thepowerful House of Representatives, the LDP president isassured of becoming prime minister.   Mr. Mitsuzuka, 63 years old, was first elected to theHouse in 1972. In 1985, he was named transport minister. Healso served as foreign minister.
