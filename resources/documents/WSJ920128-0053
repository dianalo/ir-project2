Saul RealEstate Investment Trust.   Under the terms of the order, the younger Saul will pay$38,438 in civil penalties under the Insider TradingSanctions Act.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, the agency settled its case against Mr.Saul's former roommate, Peter Garvy, who will pay $93,877 inalleged profits, penalties and interest. They both settledwithout admitting or denying wrongdoing.   The SEC sued Mr. Saul III and Mr. Garvy with insidertrading in connection with B.F. Saul Real Estate InvestmentTrust's 1988 acquisition by Westminster Investment Corp. TheSEC alleged that Mr. Saul obtained inside information aboutthe pending deal from his father, B. Francis Saul II, andpassed it on to Mr. Garvy, who then bought the stock andearned a profit of about $38,438.   The SEC enforcement effort ironically was triggered by acomplaint from the senior Mr. Saul, who complained to theagency that the stock price had run up just before the dealwas announced. When the SEC traced back the source of thetrades, they uncovered Mr. Garvy's account, in turn leadingthem back to the alleged tip from the younger Mr. Saul.   A lawyer for Mr. Saul III, B. Scott Custer Jr., said hisclient &quot;felt it was better to get this behind him.&quot; He addedthat the younger Mr. Saul has gone to work with his family inits real estate and savings-and-loan business.</TEXT></DOC>
