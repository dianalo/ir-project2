It was novel. It played to the fringe. The Chilies became a cultattraction, a cool step up for disaffected slam dancers.;   But the followinggrew, and now the Chili Peppers sound is everywhere: in the music of LivingColour, Urban Dance Squad, Primus, Scatterbrain, 24-7 Spyz, Hard Corps, evenMTV jingles.;   In their view, the Red Hot Chili Peppers arrived years ago,and over countless tours, an EP and four albums (including 1989's &quot;Mother'sMilk,&quot; with their hit &quot;Higher Ground&quot; by Stevie Wonder) have merely honedtheir work until they have become irresistible even to Big Chill yuppies insuits. Nonetheless, with so many reverent knockoffs, and a memorable cameo onthe Andre Agassi commercial for Nike (&quot;You wanna play rock 'n' roll tennis?&quot;),1991 has been a breakthrough year.;   &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik,&quot; the album theChilies made to distance themselves from their imitators, sold more than500,000 copies in its first five weeks. And despite the soft economy, theband's tour has sold out at every stop.;   Naturally, as newly crownedpatriarchs of funk-fusion, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are psyched. But they'realso a little concerned. &quot;Some of those bands are making the mistake ofconnecting with the sound instead of the spirit,&quot; says lead singer AnthonyKiedis, 29. &quot;They're being way too literal. You can hear the calculation inwhat they do.&quot;;   He and the other Chilies prefer the approach taken by thegrungy hard-core trio Nirvana. &quot;We all really like their new album,'Nevermind,' &quot; says Kiedis. The trio will join the Chilies at their Cow Palaceshow.;   &quot;We called them up while they were on the road to see if they coulddo some dates with us on the West Coast. They were burnt and wanted to get offthe road, but they were into it, because they said they've been listening tothe Chili Peppers for years and years. That's cool. We might have influencedthem, but they don't sound anything like us.&quot;;   Similarly, Kiedis creditsParliament-Funkadelic as the foundation for the Chilies' sound. But, he says,he and his band mates added &quot;the true flavor and spirit of punk rock.&quot; Whathappens when Kiedis, bassist Flea, guitarist John Frusciante and drummer ChadSmith play is more than just loud music -- it's a challenging, physicallymoving, whole-body experience Kiedis dryly describes as &quot;borderlinemaniacal.&quot;;   The band, known for its blunt sexuality and jagged, insolentattitude, doesn't necessarily intend to incite riots or send fans into orbit,he explains. They just want to capture, and build on, the energy of theirfans.;   &quot;The more unrestrained energy, the better shows we have. When weplayed in Pittsburgh (in November) . . . the crowd was into letting loose, andthat had a profound impact on us. Flea annihilated his bass into splinters.The kids were just in a frenzy. It feels great to stir up that kind ofintensity.&quot;;   But if the Chilies' only contribution were raw energy, theywouldn't have lasted this long. &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik,&quot; produced by legendaryrap impresario Rick Rubin and recorded in an allegedly haunted Hollywoodmansion, argues that it's possible to think and dance at the same time. Atopgo-go, hip-hop and sludgy, industrial-strength funk beats are songs aboutracism, about the social taboos surrounding sex, about sexuality, about theneed for companionship in an alienated age. The lyrics, while occasionallysophomoric and overly hormonal, are never didactic, and usually contain a hintof self-aware humor.;   In fact, the messages on the new album are somethingof a rock breakthrough: While most bands obsess over the verse-chorusstructures their forefathers handed down, the Chilies are forging a morestreetwise, urgent mode of communication. It's &quot;explicit&quot; in both language andapproach -- and Kiedis means that as a positive.;   &quot;It means we're beingprecise rather than nebulous. But it's not part of some plot or attack on theworld. We spend so little time analyzing what we're saying. I think we'reconnecting on a subconscious rather than conscious level, and we'd just rathernot delete the certain less palatable aspects.&quot;;   &quot;Blood Sugar&quot; is the firstChili Peppers album to be recorded primarily live, without the metronomicclick track that provides the backbone for so much of pop. That meant greaterfreedom to execute subtle tempo changes and switchback turnarounds.;   Whileit was recording, the band deliberately avoided journalists, who, Kiedis says,have treated the band unfairly. Following two charges of sexual battery (oneagainst Kiedis in Virginia, the other against Flea during an MTV Spring Breakevent in Daytona Beach, Fla.) that were settled out of court, the Chilies wereportrayed as sex-obsessed.;   &quot;Instead of getting the musical and spiritualpicture, the media makes it look like this band is just about sex and franticenergy. Everybody had the same angle: Four superfreaks from Hollywood.Everybody called us sexist even when we were singing about the wonders of sexand the female form. I guess that's easier to deal with than music thatadheres to no boundaries.&quot;;   Red Hot Chili Peppers; With Nirvana and PearlJam; When: 8:30 p.m. Dec. 31; Where: Cow Palace, Geneva Avenue at SantosStreet, Daly City; Tickets: $27.50; Call: BASS (408) 998-2277; (510) 762-2277  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TOM MOON, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911220  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  17  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  976  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, December 20, 199100355004,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
