Journal on naming Lauro Cavazos as educationsecretary:   Democrats got to have their cake and bash it too last week asPresident Reagan nominated Lauro F. Cavazos, the 61-year-oldpresident of Texas Tech University and Health Science Center inLubbock, to replace Secretary of Education William Bennett.   Democrats got a nominee they can be happy with, but they alsogot a selection they can bash as a cynical attempt to improveGeorge Bush's election hopes by naming a Hispanic to a cabinetlevel position for the first time.   Of course, there's no advantage to a cynical move exposed assuch. That allows people across the political spectrum who arevitally concerned with education to focus on Cavazos, not thecircumstances surrounding his nomination.   There are many who could run the Department of Education ascompetently, but perhaps none so suited to tackle a criticaldilemma of the U.S. system, its failure to engage, hold and upliftthe educational norm of minorities.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 15   Albany (Ore.) Democrat-Herald on child care:   As he often does on tax matters, Sen. Bob Packwood makes a lotof good sense with his proposal for improved tax credits for childcare.   Packwood introduced his bill ... asking for a reasoned,practical, free-enterprise way in which the federal tax law canmake life a little easier for American families with small childrenwho need day care while the parents work. ...   If a child-care bill has to be enacted, it should be one modeledon Packwood's.   It is based on the sound principle of providing actual helpwithout a lot of fuss and government rules.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 14   Uniontown (Pa.) Herald-Standard on lead in drinking water:   The Environmental Protection Agency ... proposed rules governingthe amount of lead in drinking water for Americans.   Costs to consumers could run extremely high. Those getting waterfrom smaller systems could see water bill increases of $367 peryear.   EPA's action helps many to avoid the health hazards associatedwith lead in their water. Most families will be pleased by this.   But ... for many families, especially those on lower or fixedincomes, we must ask how these families are to pay water billshundreds of dollars more each year when many can't afford toproperly feed their young.   Environmentalists are right in seeking lead reduction in waterat the tap, but to force families to replace plumbing systems wouldbe a tremendous burden to many.   EPA took some good first steps. Evaluating them within areasonable time will help determine if additional lead restrictionsare needed.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 12   Daily News, Los Angeles, on the U.S.-Contra policy:   The Senate's Democrats have just managed to wriggle out of avote on military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, thereby sparingthemselves the unpleasantness of having to take a clear andmeaningful stand.   The Senate narrowly decided Wednesday (Aug. 10) to continue U.S.policy of sending near-worthless care packages _ food, medicine andthe like _ to those foes of the Sandinista government.   While the Contras technically get another crack at militarysupplies next month, there is scant hope that Congress will approveContra arms funding during the remaining five months of the Reaganpresidency.   Thus, the civil war between the Contras and the MarxistSandinistas may indeed be over, depending on who wins thepresidential election. But even under a presumably pro-Contra Bushadministration, it might already be too late.</TEXT><TEXT>   Aug. 11   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on the Iran-Iraq cease-fire:   The Iran-Iraq cease-fire, to begin on Aug. 20, is the essentialfirst step down what can be expected to be a difficult road topeace in the Persian Gulf.   It also comes as additional, and welcome, evidence that theUnited Nations can play an effective peacemaking role in the world.   The United Nations could do little to forge solutions toregional conflicts when it was paralyzed by constant disputesbetween the United States and the Soviet Union.   But where there has been mutual superpower willingness tosupport U.N. efforts, the organization has proved its value.   Even as the U.N. enlarges its peacemaking role, however, itfaces crippling fiscal constraints.   They are caused primarily by the refusal of the United States topay its dues and its share of the cost of U.N. peacekeepingoperations. ...   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., who sponsored legislationwitholding full payment of U.N. dues, believes the time has nowcome for the United States ``to shoulder our responsibility'' forU.N. funding.   We fully agree.</TEXT></DOC>
