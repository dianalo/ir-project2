Mr. Seidman will appear before the House Budget Committeetoday with new estimates for losses to the bank insurancefund. Though the FDIC now expects fewer banks to fail, itwill forecast that some larger-than-average size banks willbecome insolvent, he said.</LP><TEXT>   While the losses to the fund won't be up substantially, hesaid, they will be severe enough to drive the fund into thered this year, rather than next, as the FDIC recentlyprojected.   &quot;It's not catastrophic, but it's worse, rather thanbetter,&quot; Mr. Seidman said. He declined to give the actuallosses or the size of the banks. &quot;They aren't necessarilyhuge banks, but some are bigger than most we've seen.&quot;   Earlier this year, regulators seized Bank of New England,a $22 billion-asset bank based in Boston. It was thethird-largest bank failure.   Recently, the FDIC said its most pessimistic projectionassumed that roughly 440 banks would fail through 1992. Underthat assumption, the fund would have been roughly $200million in the black through 1991 and would post a $4.6billion deficit at the end of 1992.   Mr. Seidman already has requested that the bank insurancefund be recapitalized by the fall, and the House BankingCommittee is considering two bills to address the fund. Onewould simply recapitalize the fund. The other, currentlyunder consideration, is the broader bill backed by the Bushadministration that would allow banks into insurance andsecurities businesses.   More bad news about the bank insurance fund could increasethe likelihood that the narrower recapitalization bill wouldquickly be passed. But that would remove the urgency from theBush banking bill, possibly diminishing its chances ofpassage.   Also yesterday, the Bush administration said it wants toextend the life of Resolution Trust Corp., the controversialsavings-and-loan cleanup agency, and requested an additional$80 billion for the Sandamp;L cleanup.   Treasury Secretary Nicolas Brady, who appeared before theSenate Banking Committee along with Federal Reserve ChairmanAlan Greenspan and Housing and Urban Development SecretaryJack Kemp, said that depressed real estate values have raisedthe costs for the Sandamp;L cleanup. The administration already hasspent $80 billion on the cleanup, not including temporaryborrowing and interest costs.   The credit crunch, which has hurt the ability of manypeople to buy real estate, continues to be a particularworry, said Mr. Brady. He, along with Messrs. Greenspan andKemp, comprise an oversight board for the Sandamp;L cleanup.   As recently as last week, Mr. Brady said, administrationofficials met with banking and thrift regulators to assessways to pressure banks to be less stingy with loans. &quot;It'sshown very little in the way of improvement,&quot; Mr. Greenspansaid. &quot;We spend an inordinate amount of time,&quot; on the issue.   While Mr. Kemp ardently called for changes in tax laws,Mr. Greenspan said he doesn't favor &quot;revisiting&quot; the tax lawsof 1986, which revoked tax incentives for owning commercialreal estate.   But he said that there might be narrow &quot;rifleshot&quot; ways toraise depressed commercial real estate values. Mr. Greenspandidn't elaborate on what those actions might be. Commercialreal estate values &quot;will self-correct,&quot; he predicted. &quot;Theissue is a question of time and whether it's appropriate toengage in efforts to accelerate the process.&quot;   Mr. Brady also proposed creating a chief executive postfor RTC, the Sandamp;L cleanup agency. That person would have theauthority to cut through the agency's multilayeredbureaucracy.   It seems likely that the new post will be created, but itwasn't clear how. In testimony before the same committee lastweek, Mr. Seidman, who also is chairman of the RTC, said thatMr. Brady and the other Sandamp;L oversight officials would selectthe new chief executive.   Mr. Brady contends that the decision is Mr. Seidman's,unless new legislation gives Mr. Brady the authority tocreate and fill the position.   &quot;This gets to the matter of the problem,&quot; said Sen. DonaldReigle, (D., Mich.), chairman of the committee. &quot;That is, whois in charge? It's not clear who does what.&quot;   Committee and administration members mentioned GeraldGreenwald, a former Chrysler Corp. executive who is now aninvestment banker at Dillon, Read andamp; Co., and David Maxwell,former chairman of the Federal National Mortgage Association,as potential candidates for the post, in which they seek ahigh-profile executive with a proven track record in realestate and complex transactions.   &quot;Any volunteers?&quot; asked Mr. Kemp. &quot;What you are asking foris a permanent, designated scapegoat.&quot;   Some committee members, including two Republicans, saidthat they would fight Mr. Brady's proposal to extend theperiod during which the agency may seize insolvent Sandamp;Ls toSeptember 1993 from August 1992.   &quot;I am going to fight any effort to extend the RTC,&quot; saidSen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas), who favors the fastest possiblesale of the Sandamp;L assets and thrift seizures. &quot;We ought to sellthis off, take our losses, swallow hard and pay the billcollector.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
