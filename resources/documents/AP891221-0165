OAS Chairman Angus Albert Khan of Trinidad and Tobago said hehad been approached by several delegations asking for more timebefore beginning debate on a resolution submitted Wednesday byNicaragua. He did not say when the session would resume.   Nicaragua's leftist government on Wednesday introduced aresolution calling on the members to condemn the use of force anddemand the immediate withdrawal of American troops. As written, themeasure could be interpreted to include the more than 10,000 U.S.soldiers permanently based in Panama.   The members held firm to OAS procedures Wednesday and put offdebate on that resolution for 24 hours. They also used establishedprocedures to rebuff a request by the U.S.-recognized government ofGuillermo Endara in Panama to accept a new representative.   Instead, Panama is representated by Jose Maria Cabrera, whodecried ``the brutal and criminal aggression'' against his homelandand de facto ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Traditional U.S. allies, in speech after speech Wednesday, spokeout against the use of force in the region. But the agreementstopped there.   OAS sources, speaking Thursday on the condition of anonymity,said at least two other resolutions were being prepared by theLatin countries. The sources said the new drafts would include acondemnation of Noriega, who is wanted in the United States on drugtrafficking charges but eluded capture when troops stormed intoPanama City.   The Caribbean members said they did not have enough time toconsult their governments on an appropriate response.   ``It's even more fragmented that that,'' U.S. ambassador LuigiEinaudi said after the session. He declined to comment further,saying only that the United States ``obviously won't acceptcondemnation.''   The OAS has not been asked to decide which government itrecognizes in Panama. The United States announced Wednesday thatEndara was sworn into office hours after the first troops arrived.He was elected in May in balloting later nullified by Noriega.   During the Wednesday evening session, member nations longconsidered U.S. allies read statements condemning the assault onPanama. The criticism came from Chile, Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala,Haiti and Costa Rica.   ``We see abusive practices have not been forgotten and we do notaccept it. We protest it,'' said Peruvian ambassador Edmundo Hayade la Torre. ``This does not mean we support General Manuel AntonioNoriega.''   Defense for the U.S. assault came from El Salvador, which saidthe U.S. action supported the freely elected government. Backingalso came from Canada, which holds observer status until it becomesa member next year.   Canadian representative Richard Gorham said his government``regretted the use of force'' but added: ``We must nonethelessagain highlight the extraordinary circumstances which have causedthe United States to act as it has, and to support its objective ofrestoring constitutional, democratic government to the republic ofPanama.''   Cabrera accused the United States of ``slaughtering defenselesscivilians'' and said Panamanians would not back Endara.   ``He will stay thanks to the bayonets, the gunships and thetanks of the U.S. Army,'' he said. ``No worthy Panamanian, noPanamanian who is aware of his homeland can accept Guillermo Endaraas president.''</TEXT></DOC>
