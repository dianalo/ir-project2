But important jobsdata first face a different enemy: downward revisions.   The National Association of Purchasing Management's indexis expected to hover around 47.4%, the same level as in July,according to MMS International Inc., a unit of McGraw-HillInc., New York. But the reading remains well below 50%,indicating a sliding economy. A reading above 50% indicatesan expanding economy. In June, the index stood at 51.1%.August's unemployment rate, due out Friday, is also expectedto be flat following the previous month's deepening to 5.5%.Furthermore, benchmark revisions are expected to slicefurther into the softening payroll head count. The week'sonly other major indicator is construction spending, also dueout today and also likely to remain soft.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The numbers are going to be weak,&quot; said Donald H.Straszheim, Merrill Lynch's chief economist, who thinks thepurchasers' index may slip a bit further. &quot;All this invasiondoes is create uncertainty and that causes a lot ofbusinessmen to freeze in their tracks.&quot;   Ironically, the jump in oil prices may be a partlypositive influence on the August index by pushing up theprice component. And, the inventory segment may be plumped bybuyers trying to hedge against rising costs for fuel andpetrochemical-based supplies.   Some mixed signals came Friday from two smaller, regionalpruchasing managers' indexes: Detroit and Chicago. The AugustChicago index rose nearly one percentage point to 49.2%. Butthe Detroit index fell sharply to 44.1% from 52.8% in July --the largest one-month drop since November 1987, right afterthe October stock-market plummet. Economists said thediversified Chicago economy probably helped the Windy Cityindex hold up better than the auto-dependent Detroit area.The Detroit purchasers cited the Mideast conflict as a sourceof pessimism but noted that weakness in the auto industry wasa key factor.   &quot;The purchasers' index tells the continuing story of theend of the auto `miniboom,'&quot; said Gary Ciminero, chiefeconomist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, Providence, R.I.He and others believe that rising oil prices only add to themounting economic reasons why consumers aren't likely to rushout to buy new cars, regardless of any incentives. He expectsauto makers to cut September and October production levelsbecause of the oil crisis.   But Mr. Ciminero believes that the government's benchmarkrevisions to important past employment data are potentiallyfar more negative than whatever the national purchasers'index discloses. &quot;We can throw out all these jigs and jags inmonthly employment numbers. They were far weaker than wethought,&quot; he says.   Downward adjustments in hourly wages may be particularlysignificant, said Mr. Ciminero. Lower wage levels might easeconcerns over wage-push inflation and explain &quot;why consumersare so strapped.&quot;   David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI/McGraw Hill,agrees that the jobs report will be negative. &quot;We're lookingfor a weak August following a massive drop in July,&quot; he said.The consensus calls for an increase of only 75,000 non-farmjobs in August -- excluding layoffs of temporary censusworkers. Including the layoffs, nonfarm payrolls in Augustfell by 33,000 jobs, according to the consensus view.   Rising oil prices, coupled with the downturn inconstruction, prompted economists at Morgan Guaranty TrustCo. to predict an imminent recession. Morgan said in astatement Friday that the U.S. economy appears likely to moveinto recession over the next few months.   ---                     Closely Watched Reports                                                                                                             Statistics Released in the Week Ended Aug. 31                                                                                                                                                       CHANGE                                           (from prior                               TOTAL       period)                                                                                                        Money supply                                                                                                          M1 -- Week ended   Aug. 20 (in billions)        $817.6           +$2.7                                                                                                          M2 -- Week ended   Aug. 20 (in billions)      $3,306.4           +$6.5                                                                                                          M3 -- Week ended   Aug. 20 (in billions)      $4,091.0           +$5.1                                                                                                        Manufacturers' orders July, (in billions)           $240.35           +1.6%                                                                                                        New jobless claims week ended Aug. 18            382,000           +4.4%                                                                                                        July, change in percentage points                4.9%          unchg.
