Garden of Eatin' in Los Angeles now bringsus Yankee Doodles, chips made from -- are you ready for this? -- red, whiteand blue corn.;    Despite the shameless marketing approach, the chips arequite good. They're light, fresh-tasting and easy on salt and fat. Each colorof chip has a subtle difference in taste and texture, too. A six-ounce bagcosts about $1.99. Look for Yankee Doodles in health and natural-foods stores.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Food  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SNACK MAKER WAVES FLAG  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Tasting Notes  </MEMO><TEXT>  (hbox);    Two weeks ago, I received three bags of Keebler's new Pizzeriaspizza chips in what had to be the most environmentally incorrect package I'veseen in a while. In addition, the ingredient list had enough verbiage to filla day's worth of the Congressional Quarterly.;    And the taste? Not bad,actually, and mildly habit-forming if you must know, though all three versionshad a slight chalky aftertaste. The zesty pepperoni isn't especially zesty butit does taste tomatoey and crispy. It's sort of like a thin-crusted pizza leftin the oven too long -- probably how they got the idea. The cheese versiontastes a little more like a pizza. And the supreme, the everything-on-itvariety, tastes mostly of bell pepper. A seven-ounce bag costs about $1.69.;(hbox);    The great Alpine Lace cheese mystery has been solved. For those whomissed the first episode, on Feb. 20 I went gaga over Alpine Lace's Lean N'Free fat-free cheese. Unfortunately, I found that what I tasted was notfat-free cheese but low-fat Monterey jack. The difference is that low-fatcheese has five grams of fat per ounce instead of a 1/2 gram and 80 caloriesinstead of 35. Wouldn't you know it?;    To complicate matters, readers had ahard time finding Alpine Lace Lean N' Free. On top of that, Alpine Lacechanged the name of its fat-free cheese from Lean N' Free to Free N' Lean.;   So, here's the real skinny on Alpine Lace low-fat and fat-free cheeses. Thelow-fat cheeses come in many flavors though I've tasted only the Monterey jackand Swiss. I recommend the Monterey jack. The fat-free cheeses come inmozzarella and cheddar styles. I tried both and wasn't wild about either. Butsince mozzarella is a bland cheese used mainly for melting, you don't losemuch when you use the fat-free version. (The company suggests melting bothfat-free cheeses in the microwave at 75 percent power for 30 seconds.);   Thanks to detective work from Sue Norris of Bread of Life in Campbell (whichdoesn't carry them), I found that both fat-free cheeses are available at NobHill stores and selected Fry's and Lucky stores. They cost about $2 for asix-ounce package. Alpine Lace will soon market a fat-free American cheese,but company officials couldn't tell me exactly when it would be available.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Sam Gugino column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910410  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  499  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 10, 199100101128,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
