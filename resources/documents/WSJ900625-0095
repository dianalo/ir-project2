In this case, researchers at Nippon Telegraph andamp; TelephoneCorp. here have made big strides in the new field, whichinvolves building machines that can understand and react tohuman speech. Already, the NTT system can recognize 32 words.   Eight thousands miles away, though, at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., U.S. researchersare way ahead. Their computer has mastered more than 400words.   But in one of those twists that have become common inU.S.-Japan technology races, the Japanese may laugh last. Forwhile the U.S. has a better machine in the laboratory, NTThopes to begin actually selling a voice-recognition system assoon as next year. The MIT scientists, on the other hand,don't have any immediate plans to take their inventioncommercial.   Technology is the future. It drives economic growth anddetermines the course of living standards. The U.S., whichhas great institutions like MIT and dominance in much basicresearch, might think it is entering that future withpromise. Yet while Japanese scientists may win fewer NobelPrizes, time and again they do a better job of turningresearch into products. &quot;We value creativity andinnovativeness, and we don't value production,&quot; says MichaelDertouzos, director of the MIT computer-science laboratory.&quot;But the money is not in invention, it's in production.&quot;   This difference between the U.S. and Japan is clearlyevident to Japanese business people. &quot;When I first visitedthe U.S. in 1953 and 1954, Americans were producing very goodgoods,&quot; says Yotaro Iida, the blunt-talking chairman ofMitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. &quot;But recently, America hasstopped making things. And as America stops making things,Japan steps in.&quot;   Peter Likins, the president of Lehigh University, blamesfederal government science policy, which, he says, tends topromote basic research, defense and medical science at theexpense of everything else. &quot;The culture of the university,shaped by government decisions, directed a whole generationof engineers away from commercial work,&quot; Mr. Likins argues.   Michael Porter, a Harvard Business School professor, putsthe problem in broader sweep. Nations, he theorizes, movethrough three stages: First, they are driven by the naturaladvantages of their people, geography and resources; second,as they advance, they become driven by innovation, pushingthe frontiers of technology; finally, they are driven bywealth, which creates &quot;a backward-looking, rearguard actionto protect what they've got.&quot; Mr. Porter worries that theU.S. may be in that third, look-over-the-shoulder stage.   Now, major U.S. institutions like MIT find themselves insomething of an identity crisis. Throughout most of itspostwar history, this university saw itself in global terms:Its purpose was to spread technological progress throughoutthe world. Its doors were open to all, its research availableto all. If this meant providing technology to foreigncompetitors of American companies, then so be it. Ifcountries that took advantage of MIT's research did most oftheir own work in private companies, where it was unavailableto Americans, then that was all right, too.   Today, that attitude is changing, as the school wrestleswith its responsibility to help keep the U.S. competitive.One sign: a new book, co-authored by Mr. Dertouzos, called&quot;Made in America.&quot; Economic nationalism is on the rise.   &quot;Does the university have a national mission?&quot; asksKenneth Smith, vice president for research. People on campus&quot;never even asked that question before.&quot; It was simply takenfor granted that the school's interests were consistent withthe national interest. &quot;But now, it's not that apparent.&quot; Asa result, he says, the university has begun rethinking itsrole.   Leading MIT professors fret openly that Japanese companiesappear far more interested in the university's research thanAmerican companies do. Two decades ago, Harry Smith, anelectrical engineering professor, and his colleague DavidSpears did pathbreaking work in the development of X-raylithography, a technology for printing tiny and complexcircuits on semiconductors. Today in Japan, Mr. Smith says,there are 10 major programs for the development of X-raylithography; in the U.S., there are two.   &quot;It should bother everybody,&quot; he says. &quot;All the (U.S.)semiconductor industry except IBM has a very short-termview.&quot;   Ronald Latanision shares that frustration. Mr. Latanisionis director of MIT's Materials Processing Center, which isworking on materials such as high-strength ceramics andcomposite metals that may someday replace steel and plastic.The center's research is open to any company willing to pay a$10,000 fee. Between 50% and 60% of the companies involvedare American; about half the rest are Japanese. But Mr.Latanision says the Japanese participate with an enthusiasmthat outstrips that of Americans.   The Japanese are doing their most advanced research underthe auspices of private companies. Sure, American companiesare denied access to that research, says Mr. Latanision, butthe real problem is much broader than that: American firms&quot;aren't even taking advantage of what they can do here.&quot;   Moreover, people in Japan's giant corporate research labsare encouraged to care as much about the practicalapplications of technology as about pure research. Joyce andNathanael Fortune have seen this fundamental difference fromthe inside of Japanese industry.   The couple, both 28 years old, are among the first of anew wave of American scientists to migrate to Japan for anextended stay. Mr. Fortune, who has a doctorate in physics,is doing work at an electronics lab operated by Japan'sMinistry of International Trade and Industry. Ms. Fortune,who has a Ph.D. in engineering, is the lone foreigner in a300-person lab operated by NTT.   &quot;In graduate school in the United States, everybody wantsto be in basic research,&quot; not commercial research, Ms.Fortune says. &quot;It's more aesthetically pleasing.&quot; Graduatestudents, she says, believe that &quot;if you join a company, yourwork may not be published and you won't advance as ascientist.&quot;   In Japan, the incentives are reversed. Universities arepoorly funded, and much of the most important work occurswithin companies. Scientists and engineers who join thosecompanies aren't expected to pursue their own scientificcuriosity, but rather to work toward breakthroughs that willhelp the company. Japanese scientists who come up withinnovations to this end &quot;can write their own ticket&quot; at mostcompanies, Ms. Fortune says.   Back at NTT in Yokosuka, the potential gain from that sortof thinking is clear. Yoshitake Suzuki, a researcher, isdemonstrating the company's fledgling voice-recognitioncomputer system. His program is designed to take areservation for an imaginary drivers' training class.&quot;Drivers' Training School Reservation System,&quot; the computerannounces. &quot;Please enter your identification number.&quot;   Mr. Suzuki responds slowly through a microphone. &quot;One.Two. Three. Four.&quot; The computer confirms the number and,after several more seconds of carefully contrived&quot;conversation,&quot; books Mr. Suzuki a lesson at noon on the25th. Mr. Suzuki then lets his visitor book a reservation,proving that the computer can also understand voices it hasnever heard. &quot;You could use a system like this for making adoctor's appointment or ordering merchandise,&quot; Mr. Suzukisays.   John Stern, the American Electronics Association's vicepresident for Asian operations in Tokyo, sees this fervidpursuit of technology as an outgrowth of the culture atJapanese corporations. They don't exist just for theenrichment of their stockholders, he contends, but also pay agreat deal of attention to the needs of their employees, whoexpect to work for them their entire lives.   &quot;Is there anybody in an American company who says, `My jobis to see that this company is still in business 10 yearsfrom now?'&quot; Mr. Stern asks. &quot;In Japan, people have to worryabout continuing to provide employment.&quot;   To power the research and development to produce thosejobs, one also, of course, needs deep pockets. And that'sanother reason the Japanese have an edge in commercializingtechnology -- they have lots of money to invest. Takebiotechnology. Increasingly, U.S. biotech startups, hungryfor financing, are getting acquired by the Japanese, or findthemselves going hat in hand to Japan in pursuit of capital.   On a beat-up side street in Cambridge, Mass., a U.S.company called Matritech Inc., founded in 1987, is working onnew products to help detect diseases such as cancer. ButMatritech, which wants to stay independent, needs money totake some of those projects the next step. So Stephen Chubb,its president, packed a bag and headed to Japan. &quot;We aretalking to U.S. and European companies too,&quot; he says, &quot;butthere's a disproportionate interest on the part of theJapanese.&quot; Eventually, several Japanese companies profferedfinancing.   During his visit, Mr. Chubb also saw firsthand how Japantends to make longterm commitments. While at a culturalcenter, he learned of a time capsule the Japanese have sealed-- and don't plan to open for another 5,000 years. &quot;How longwould someone put a time capsule in the ground in thiscountry?&quot; he asks. &quot;That indicated to me a difference inthinking.&quot;   When Japanese and American values come together in thesame enterprise, there are many differences in thinking. Orso discovered the people at Shin Caterpillar MitsubishiLtd.'s facility near Kobe.   SCM, jointly owned by Caterpillar Inc. and MitsubishiHeavy Industries Ltd. and founded in 1963, is one of theoldest U.S.-Japan joint ventures. Today it functions as theworld-wide design center for all of Caterpillar's hydraulicexcavators.   Some 30 American engineers from Peoria, Ill., moved toNishi Akashi to work side-by-side with Mitsubishi engineers.The philosophical differences were apparent immediately. TheJapanese engineers couldn't understand why their Americancounterparts wanted to knock off and go home each evening fordinner with their families; the Americans couldn't understandwhy the Japanese didn't want to. The top American engineerhad a private office back in the U.S. In Japan, he ended upin an open room with seven other managers, his own deskabutting that of a Japanese colleague.   But the difference that mattered most was how the twogroups viewed their role, claims Noriyuki Itakura, who camefrom Mitsubishi. &quot;The Japanese engineer tends to consider theimpact of his design on cost or manufacturability,&quot; Mr.Itakura says. The Americans, he contends, simply &quot;want toknow whether it can be done from an engineering point ofview.&quot;   This inclination to take in the bigger picture seems toexplain much of the Japanese success in technologicalindustries. But there are other critical traits as well: OnceJapan decides it wants to be strong in an industry, ittypically pursues its goal with determination and a view tothe longterm. Japan's approach to aerospace may be theultimate example.   America's lead in aerospace is one of its most importantcompetitive advantages. The industry generates high-wage jobsand lucrative exports for the U.S. It also creates demand forother, related high-tech industries such as opto-electronicsand propulsion.   Japan has struggled for 30 years to build an aerospaceindustry, undaunted by its own failures and by thesuperiority of overseas rivals. In the 1960s Mitsubishi Heavyand other Japanese aircraft makers did build a 60-seatcommercial plane from scratch -- the YS11 -- but they wereable to sell only 160 of them.   In the U.S., where there isn't much patience when it comesto losses, that might have been the end of the aerospaceeffort. Japan simply regrouped. Representatives of industryand the government, which had agreed on the initialindustrial policy of developing a purely Japanese airplane,decided that Japan would instead follow a course of&quot;international collaboration&quot; as a subcontractor of parts andsystems and as a licensee of foreign technology.   Today Mitsubishi Heavy and other Japanese companiesproduce military planes under American licenses, make majorcomponents of Boeing Co. jetliners and are eager tocollaborate with other foreign manufacturers. MitsubishiHeavy, for example, is widely expected to announce in thenext year or two that it will begin joint development of a75-seat airliner with a European company.   Meanwhile, Japanese companies are winning contracts toprovide some of the highly advanced materials that will gointo foreign and domestic planes of the future. Thegovernment is coordinating research on a new kind of enginethat could propel a supersonic plane from New York to Tokyoin less than half the 14 hours the flight currently takes.And, using technology that was created in the U.S. butlargely left unexploited, the Japanese are positioningthemselves to become the major launchers of commercial spacesatellites by the end of this decade.   &quot;Because they're investing in technology, they're going tobecome an increasingly important player,&quot; says LawrenceClarkson, a senior vice president of Boeing's commercialairplane group. &quot;Today they're looked at by the world assubcontractors. Fifteen years from now they'll be majorplayers however you define it.&quot; Mr. Clarkson says Boeing ispreparing for that day by investing in research anddevelopment and by protecting its most sensitive technologyfrom competitors. If the industry fails to maintain its edge,the consequences for the U.S. could be serious.   In fact, Mr. Iida, the Mitsubishi chairman, is inclined toissue a chilling warning to his American competitors. Sittingin his conference room high above Tokyo's financial district,he says: &quot;If you get out of the business of making airliners,if you let what happened to you in other industries happen inaircraft, your economy will really go downhill.&quot;   ---                   Different Perceptions                                                                                                          Which nation do you believe is stronger in science andtechnology right now, the U.S. or Japan?
