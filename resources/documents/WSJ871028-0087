SchlesingerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GMEARNINGS (ERN)AUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Motors Corp. reported sharply higher third-quarter net income through liberalizing its accounting of equipment depreciation and other items.    Without the changes, however, the No. 1 auto maker's sales slump would have produced a wider operating loss than the one reported for the year-earlier period.    Meanwhile, the auto maker's chief labor negotiator refuted analysts' predictions that GM's new contract with the United Auto Workers will inhibit cost-cutting. He said the pact would enhance GM's competitive position, mainly through closer labor-management cooperation.    GM reported net for the quarter more than doubled to $812 million, or $2.28 a share, from $345 million, or 80 cents a share, in the year-ago period.    The increase had more to do with bookkeeping than car making. The most recent earnings were bolstered by GM's decision to lengthen the estimated lives of its plants, equipment and special tools, thus slowing its depreciation and amortization charges. GM said its new practices are more in line with those at other auto makers.    Earnings also were helped by higher profit at GM's three non-consolidated subsidiaries, which reported results earlier this week.    Without the accounting changes, net for the quarter would have dropped 43%, to 46 cents a share. Furthermore, GM's operating loss would have widened to $536.9 million from $251.5 million a year ago.    The accounting change was widely expected, and GM's underlying performance was actually better than some analysts had predicted. Partly as a result of that, GM jumped $3.875, to $59.375 a share, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    &quot;I firmly believe I'm seeing some progress,&quot; said Charles Brady, analyst with Oppenheimer andamp; Co. But he added, &quot;I'm not going to be foolish enough to think that within the next quarter or so it's going to be shining brightly through. In 1988, we're going to start seeing the improvements, and in terms of a real increase in the bottom line, it's still a 1989 story.&quot;    The main reason for GM's soft performance was the sales slump. Third-quarter revenue of $22.61 billion was about even with that of the year-ago quarter. But sales of vehicles world-wide dropped about 10%. Lower volume and a less-favorable mix of products sold took $1.79 a share out of earnings.    Chrysler Corp. yesterday reported third-quarter net grew 7.7%. Ford Motor Co. earlier this week said net rose 1.4%; the No. 2 maker is on track to pass GM in profit for the second year in a row.    Ford enjoyed the best relative performance of the Big Three. Its net totaled 4.6% of its revenue for the quarter, while Chrysler's was 4.1% and GM's was 3.6%. GM's position was helped because it didn't pay any taxes during the quarter -- largely because of unused investment tax credits -- while the other auto makers did.    One reason for GM's recent trouble has been its relatively high cost structure. Earlier this year, the auto maker outlined a plan to pare annual costs $10 billion by the end of 1990. Yesterday, the auto maker said it still hoped to meet that goal: It projects reducing costs this year by $3 billion and $4 billion more next year.    And despite the weak earnings performance, executives issued upbeat statements about GM's future. &quot;We fully expect to improve our market share and competitive position in North America as more of our 1988 models enter the marketplace,&quot; Chairman Roger B. Smith said.    Wall Street in general has been concerned about GM in recent weeks because of its new labor contract. The three-year pact includes a job-security program that prevents layoffs except during a sales drop, prevents plant closings and slows attrition. Many analysts predict the provisions will hamper GM's efforts to restructure operations and shed uncompetitive plants, particularly in parts operations.    But &quot;everyone has missed the spirit of the agreement -- analysts aren't willing to put a value on that,&quot; Alfred S. Warren, GM's main negotiator, argued yesterday in the company's first public discussion of the pact since it was ratified.    &quot;I feel a willingness in the UAW to sit down and talk as never before about our problems,&quot; he added. &quot;Nobody understands how profitable we can become if every man and woman (in the company) is looking to help increase quality.&quot;    Specifically, Mr. Warren said he was optimistic about the outcome of committees that will be set up in every plant and that in six months will have to report ways to improve productivity and quality. To ensure that the groups work, GM will educate all plant managers from around the country on what to do with the contract.    Mr. Warren added that the contract preserved GM's operating flexibility. Despite the plant-closing moratorium, he said the company felt it still could cease operations at a non-competitive facility so long as it guaranteed the wages and benefits of the affected workers. The contract even may result in pay cuts at non-competitive plants, although &quot;we don't anticipate that,&quot; he said.    Mr. Warren declined to discuss the cost of the contract, but some GM officials are telling analysts and other companies that they expect the pact to increase labor costs a maximum of 7% a year. Although it agreed to a contract largely similar to one Ford had agreed to earlier, GM expects to get more savings than Ford -- roughly 20 cents more per worker hour through tougher health-care and absenteeism policies. At Sept. 30, GM's hourly labor cost was $26.18 per worker.    For the first nine months, GM's net increased 6% to $2.72 billion, or $7.70 a share, from $2.56 billion, or $7.24 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue eased 2% to $75.4 billion from $77.29 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
