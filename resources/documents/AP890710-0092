He didn't quite make it, but he made a good try.   At the beginning of his speech to parliament, Bush paid greetingsto Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, Sejm speaker MikolajKozakiewicz, Senate speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski and Prime MinisterMieczyslaw F. Rakowski.   He did a passable job on Jaruzelski and Kozakiewicz, but theothers were a muddle.   What should have been pronounced Stel-ma-HOV-ski came out``Stal-ma-CHOW-ski'' and Ra-KOFF-ski came out ``Ra-KOW-ski.''   If he felt self-conscious about the task, Bush could take comfortfrom the fact that Poles have trouble saying his name, too.   It usually comes out ``Boosh.''   Jaruzelski, by the way, is pronounced Yah-ruh-ZEL-ski, andKozakiewicz is Ko-za-KIEH-vich.</TEXT></DOC>
