(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An ex-convict suspected in theslayings of four gay men in two states preyed on pen pals he madewhile in prison, police said.   Keith Eugene Goodman, 30, was arrested with two companionsSunday while visiting another of Goodman's pen pals, Peter G.Jones, a Carnegie-Mellon University professor on sabbatical inLaguna Beach, Police Chief Albert C. Ehlow said Tuesday.   ``If we had not arrested Goodman, I do believe the man Joneswould have been the next victim,'' said Sgt. Richard E. Downing.   Goodman, Jon Christopher Mead, 22, and Tracy Holland, 21, all ofAnderson, Ind., were arrested Sunday for investigation of thekillings of a New York man and three Mississippi men, Ehlow said.   ``The victims all were gay. The suspects allegedly wouldbefriend the victims before they were murdered and robbed,'' thepolice chief said.   Jones was among an estimated 20 to 25 pen pals Goodman had whileserving time in an Indiana prison for burglary and sexual assaulton an 80-year-old woman, authorities said.   ``It's very frightening,'' Jones said in an interview. ``I seemyself as very lucky because the police told me I was the nextvictim.''   The New York victim and one Mississippi victim were pen pals,Ehlow said.   ``It's a con's con game,'' Ehlow said. ``They write to people totell them how bad off they are, asking for money to help themthrough, get a better defense lawyer, that sort of thing. Andpeople send them money and befriend them.''   Authorities say Goodman and Mead left for New York on Dec. 16 tomeet Harold D. Williams of Windsor, N.Y., one of Goodman's penpals. Williams, 60, was found shot to death Dec. 21 in an upstairsbedroom of his house.   ``They probably intended to hit him up for money and rob him.They ended up killing him,'' said Ehlow.
