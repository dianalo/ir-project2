Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BNK ECO EMI </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thrift-industry capital increased in August for the second time in more than a year, but only because of spending by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.    The board reported that regulatory capital in thrifts it insures &quot;rose sharply,&quot; by $5.8 billion in August. But James Barth, the board's chief economist, noted that this was a result of Bank Board assistance to merge 43 insolvent thrifts during August.    In fact, it appeared thrift capital would have declined in August, perhaps sharply, if the Bank Board's mergers hadn't bolstered it.    Mr. Barth said more than $6 billion of reported thrift capital stemmed from the Bank Board's assistance to just three large August mergers involving 10 insolvent thrifts. Other mergers Aug. 31 that combined 14 Oklahoma thrifts into six regional institutions appear to have boosted their capital by more than $2 billion. Bank Board officials said they didn't know whether that was counted in the August reports.    The Bank Board reported that withdrawals exceeded new deposits during August by $3.3 billion, about equal to June's net deposit outflow but much more than outflows of $106 million in July and $541 million in August 1987.    For retail deposits of less than $100,000, withdrawals exceeded new deposits by $4.5 billion, compared with outflows of $531 million in July and $738 million in August 1987. Net jumbo deposits -- those exceeding $100,000 -- increased by $1.2 billion, following a $425 million jump in July and a $197 million increase the previous August.    Thrifts closed $24.6 billion in mortgages in August, up 13% from July and 20% above August 1987. Thrifts issued $24 billion in new mortgage commitments in August, up 16% from July and 23% from the previous August. </TEXT></DOC>
