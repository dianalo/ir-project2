The company had increased earnings in its oil and gas andnatural gas transmission divisions, offset by a $96 milliondrop in earnings from chemical operations.   Profit from oil and gas operations rose to $100 million inthe quarter from $35 million a year earlier. That increasereflected higher world-wide prices for crude oil and higherdomestic prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids, andthe resumption of production from the North Sea Claymore andScalpa fields after the explosion of the nearby Piper Alphaoil platform in 1988. These gains were partially offset byreduced domestic crude oil and natural gas volumes.   The latest first-quarter results included a $36 millionpretax gain from the settlement of a claim against Venezuelafor the 1975 nationalization of Occidental's commercialblock, a reduction in costs due to the restructuring lastyear of domestic oil and gas operations, a $13 million pretaxwrite-off of certain receivables, and a $16 million benefitfrom the reversal of certain income-tax reserves. Occidentalsaid the reversal of the tax reserves resulted from anInternal Revenue Service audit of the company and certainsubsidiaries back to 1985 that determined the reserves are nolonger necessary.   Earnings from chemical operations fell to $186 millionfrom $282 million in the year-earlier quarter, reflectinglower profit margins in petrochemicals and polymers andplastics. Earnings in the latest quarter included a $14million reversal of income tax reserves.   Natural gas transmission earnings rose to $94 million from$61 million a year earlier, reflecting lower operating costs,a rate refund and a $12 million tax benefit in the latestperiod. Earnings from agribusiness operations, conducted byOccidental's 51%-owned IBP Inc. subsidiary, rose to $14million in the latest first quarter from $13 million the yearbefore. Earnings from coal operations rose to $4 million from$3 million.   Among the unallocated corporate items in the year-earlierfirst quarter was a $36 million pretax charge for acharitable contribution to the Armand Hammer Museum of Artand Cultural Center. The $95 million project has sparkedshareholder litigation, and the Delaware Chancery Court isconsidering whether the outlay is appropriate.</TEXT></DOC>
