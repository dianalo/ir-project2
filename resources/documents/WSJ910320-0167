The People With AIDS Health Group, which filed the lawsuitalong with two AZT users, contends that Burroughs Wellcomedidn't invent the drug. The complaint, filed in federaldistrict court here, asserts that government scientists atthe National Institutes of Health conceived of the use of thecompound for treating the AIDS virus and performed necessaryexperiments to develop it. The compound was discovered by aMichigan scientist in 1964. Burroughs Wellcome received itspatent in early 1988.</LP><TEXT>   In a statement, Burroughs Wellcome President Philip Tracysaid, &quot;The idea that our company would engage in illegalactivities to obtain patent rights is both offensive andwrong. We fully expect to prevail in the lawsuit.&quot; Thecompany is a subsidiary of Wellcome PLC of Britain.   The plaintiffs have been urging the U.S. government tojoin them in bringing suit against the company. Yesterday,the acting director of the NIH, William Raub, said thegovernment &quot;is not a party&quot; to the suit.   But the government is clearly interested in laying claimto the development of the drug. Dr. Raub said that forseveral months NIH officials and Burroughs Wellcome have beendiscussing who invented AZT. &quot;We believe that National CancerInstitute researchers should have been named as co-inventorson these patents,&quot; he said.   The ultimate aim of the plaintiffs is to lower the priceof AZT by allowing other companies to enter the market. AnNIH official said government officials also are concernedabout the price of AZT.</TEXT></DOC>
