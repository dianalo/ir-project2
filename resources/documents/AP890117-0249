Willy De Clercq, who recently finished four years as a keyofficial of the European Economic Community, also raised thepossibility that the latest trade dispute _ sparked by a Europeanban on hormone-treated U.S. meat _ might be resolved shortly throughnegotiations.   ``I think there is a way to get out of it,'' he said in a recentinterview.   De Clercq said he considered conflicts and divergent interests tobe normal between the United States and the 12-nation Common Markettrading bloc.   ``What I have always deplored is the frequency which...increasedso visibly and intensively during the 1985 to 1989 period and theway the American administration was behaving,'' he said.   De Clercq complained that U.S. officials reacted to conflictswith the Common Market by ``putting deadlines (and) threatening withmeasures _ the famous Rambo-style diplomacy which we do not likevery much here in Brussels.''   Even so, he said, ``the atmosphere has always been good'' betweenthe giant trading partners.   ``Although there have been many, many problems, we have hadalmost no real shooting war,'' De Clercq said.   De Clercq for four years was the top trade and foreign affairsofficial of the European Commission, the Common Market's executivebody. He now is a candidate of a conservative Belgian politicalparty for the European Parliament, the trading group's legislativebody.   The latest trans-Atlantic trade spat was touched off by the EEC'sJan. 1 prohibition on imports of American meat from cattle treatedwith growth hormones. The United States retaliated by imposing, alsoon Jan. 1, higher tariffs on a variety of European products.   Common Market officials tentatively have agreed oncounter-measures that would slap stiff duties on American imports ofdried fruit and walnuts. Foreign ministers of the member nations areto meet next Monday to consider formally backing those measures.   De Clercq said the community and the United States agreed toallow sanctioned products to enter their borders through the end ofJanuary. This would apply to goods in transit before Jan. 1.   He noted the delay probably will allow the EEC to start a newdialogue on the issue with the incoming Bush administration.   ``There has to be another round of negotiations,'' he said.   But De Clercq said it was ``impossible'' for the Common Market tolift the ban on hormone-treated meat, as demanded by U.S. officials.   European officials cited health concerns in imposing the meatban, which originally was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988. Thetrading bloc agreed to a one-year delay but refused further U.S.appeals for a postponement.   ``If you say it is to protect our population, then you have tomaintain it if it is so,'' he said. ``Expecting the (community) tosay now that it is going to allow the production or entry of meatwith hormones...is an illusion.''   The prohibition is expected to halt the importation of about $100million worth of beef and beef byproducts from the United States,some of which are used in pates and sausages. Meat used to make petfood is exempted.   American officials contend the use of certain hormones to fattencattle, a common practice among U.S. farmers, does not pose a healthrisk.   The meat imports represent a tiny fraction of the estimated $166billion in trade last year between the United States and the CommonMarket.   De Clercq also said relations between the Common Market and Japanhad grown in recent years. He said European exports to Japan likelysoared by 20 percent to 25 percent last year from $15.4 billion in1987.   ``We have pushed the Japanese government...into opening themarkets more (and) integrating Japan more into the international andeconomic circuit, behaving in other words like a great economic andtrading power should,'' he said.   Common Market members are France, West Germany, Italy,Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland,Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.</TEXT></DOC>
