KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate early Saturday gave final approvalto a three-year authorization bill calling for up to $938 millionin U.S. aid to Poland and Hungary.   Actual aid to Poland and Hungary still faces hurdles, however.   An appropriations measure providing $533 million in hard cashfor the two East European nations this year is awaiting action onthe Senate floor.   But the bill faces a veto threat from President Bush because ofunrelated provisions dealing with abortion.   The authorization bill, which sets spending ceilings and policyguidelines for the aid program, hit a snag Thursday night whenRepublican senators complained that Democratic staff members hadremoved provisions intended to provide safeguards that the aidprogram not benefit communist causes and client states.   On Friday, a formal conference of House and Senate members dealtwith the problem, dropping some proposals and accepting ormodifying others. The House approved the revised version Fridaynight.   The Senate approved the legislation by voice vote early Saturdaymorning.   Quick action on the aid authorization to help Poland deal withits serious economic problems was urgently requested Wednesday bySolidarity union leader Lech Walesa as he addressed a joint meetingof Congress.   The assistance includes programs for Poland with a value of$846.5 million. Hungary would receive benefits with a total valueof $91.5 million.   During the conference, negotiators refused to accept anamendment offered by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., extending theefective life of 12 unrelated domestic tax credits, including thelow-income housing tax credit.   The conference also softened the impact of amendments offered byGOP senators, some of which sought the outright termination of theaid program if funds were diverted.   It accepted language stating that the program could be ended ifthe country involved was found to be engaged in internationalactivities ``directly and fundamentally contrary to U.S. nationalsecurity interests.''   But it rejected an attempt to cut off aid if Poland or Hungarywere found to be providing weapons or military training or othermilitary aid to Cuba or Nicaragua. Instead, it required the Bushadministration to report in six months on the extent, if any, ofsuch activities.   House Democrats contended that the provision was too extreme,and subject to exploitation by enemies of reform.   They said it would require ending all U.S. aid if Cuba receivedjust one rifle or if just one Nicaraguan policeman were trained.   The conference dropped entirely an unrelated amendment by Sen.Jesse Helms, R-N.C., dealing with the potential sale of Chinesemissiles to Middle Eastern nations.   In its current form, the bill includes a $200 million standbytrade credit insurance program for Poland added earlier by theHouse.   The centerpiece of the bill is the authorization of a $240million Free Enterprise Fund to bolster free-market reform inPoland and a $200 million fund to help Poland stabilize itsinflation-battered economy.</TEXT></DOC>
