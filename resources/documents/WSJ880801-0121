Inc.'s Chapter 11 filing under the federal Bankruptcy Code dramatizes how once meek bondholders are becoming far more militant, and are viewing themselves not so much as owners of debt, but of equity.    Indeed, Boake A. Sells, Revco's chairman and chief executive officer, characterizes his company's bankruptcy filing &quot;as a fight over who owns Revco.&quot;    In the past, holders of bonds such as pension and mutual funds and other institutions, rarely complained even after a company plunged into bankruptcy proceedings. These days, however, battle lines are being drawn early on, usually when the company says it wants to recapitalize. That is typically a signal that bonds will be significantly devalued or that debt will be swapped for common stock.    The Twinsburg, Ohio-based operator of 2,000 drug stores was forced to file for protection from creditors last Thursday after talks on a &quot;standstill agreement&quot; involving interest payments broke down between a group of bondholders and Revco's investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    Drexel was hoping to rescue Revco, which went private in a $1.25 billion leveraged buy-out in late 1986, by exchanging $703 million of Revco junk bonds for equity. However, discussions with bondholders never reached a formal proposal.    Instead, talks got snagged on the standstill agreement, in which Drexel wanted bondholders to pledge they wouldn't press for already-missed interest payments until Jan. 15. Attaining the agreement was critical, because Revco wanted to quell concerns of nervous trade creditors.    Interviews with key players in the talks suggest that Revco may have underestimated its bondholders' clout. Nathan V. Meyohas, chairman and chief executive of Transcontinental Services Group N.V., which controls 60% of Revco's common shares, says the discussions evolved into &quot;a game of chicken.&quot;    The stakes became painfully clear to Revco less than two weeks ago, when Tally Embry, managing director of Magten Asset Management Corp., said he wasn't about to consent to a standstill agreement on interest payments on about $100 million of Revco 13 1/8% junk bonds.    Mr. Embry says he told Drexel, &quot;If you put $5,000 down on a mortgage on a house and you can't pay the interest, they come and take the house. . .If Revco can't pay the interest on these bonds, I'm coming to take the house. I own the business.&quot;    On July 22, Mr. Embry told Revco he was setting in motion paperwork that would accelerate payments on the interest as well as the face amount of the bonds, an amount totaling about $108 million.    The move stunned Revco's Mr. Sells, who didn't count on a trip to bankruptcy court. &quot;I was in this office until 10:30 that Friday night and spent the whole weekend making phone calls trying to save the company from Chapter 11.&quot;    Mr. Sells called Mr. Embry, asking him to reconsider. &quot;I asked him for a shot (at preventing the bankruptcy filing). He didn't tell me forget it, and he didn't tell me he couldn't wait (for the money.&quot;)    On July 24, Mr. Embry was called again, but this time by Mr. Meyohas of Transcontinental, who says, &quot;I called him to suggest a meeting, and he replied that he thought a meeting would be useless.&quot;    Mr. Meyohas, who says he never tried to speak with any bondholders previously, indicated the call took less than three minutes. The game of chicken was over.    &quot;When Mr. Meyohas called me I told him I'm just a lender,&quot; says Mr. Embry. &quot;I told him, 'Just pay me the money. I haven't been paid for four months. Don't come to me after four months and tell me you want me to stand still.' I told him it was too late.&quot; Last Monday, the day after the call to Mr. Embry, Transcontinental wrote off its entire $9.6 million investment in Revco common stock.    For Magten, the battle continues. The firm acquired the bonds, which have been trading in the 50 cents on the dollar range, about the time Revco failed to make a $46 million semiannual interest payment on the junk bonds last June. Mr. Embry, whose firm deals in distressed securities, says he intends to hang onto the Revco bonds in hopes of recovering 80 cents on the dollar within two years. </TEXT></DOC>
