Hehad a transurethral prostatic resection, the same kind of operationperformed during his second presidential term in 1986.   _1979: He complained of pain in the right thumb, which wasdetermined to be osteoarthritic.   _March 30, 1981: A bullet fired at Reagan in an attempt on hislife hit him in the upper chest below the left arm, traveleddownward and was deflected into the left lung, coming to rest aninch from his heart. He was rushed to George Washington UniversityHospital, complaining of soreness in the rib cage. He collapsed inthe hospital corridor. The bullet was removed during three hours ofsurgery and Reagan returned to the White House after 12 days in thehospital.   _April 1, 1982: Reagan underwent a routine urological examinationat Bethesda Naval Hospital after complaining of discomfort. Doctorsfound no evidence of malignancy.   _Sept. 7, 1983: Reagan, having grown noticeably hard of hearing,was seen wearing a small hearing aid in his right ear when heappeared before a group of business and education leaders. He hasattributed his hearing loss to the firing of a handgun too near hisear on a movie set many years ago. Reagan later began wearing ahearing aid in the left ear as well.   _May 18, 1984: A small polyp was discovered in the president'scolon, but an examination showed the polyp was non-cancerous and itwas not removed.   _March 11, 1985: The White House disclosed that doctors examiningReagan earlier that month found evidence of blood in his stool and agrowth in his lower intestine. A statement said tests of occult, orhidden, blood in the feces were positive but that ``physiciansbelieve this may be from the polyp or from diet and will bemonitored.''   _March 29, 1985: Reagan suffered a burst blood vessel in his lefteye, causing it to fill partially with blood and appear red. WhiteHouse spokesman Larry Speakes said no treatment was needed.   _July 12, 1985: Doctors removed a small, benign polyp fromReagan's colon and found another, larger one that was removed thefollowing day along with 2 feet of the president's intestinal tract.The larger, 2-inch, polyp was found to be cancerous, but doctorssaid the cancer had not spread beyond the tissues that were removed.   _Aug. 1, 1985: The White House, responding to questions, said anirritated patch of skin had been removed from Reagan's nose two daysearlier. A statement said the tissue ``was submitted for routinestudies for infection, and it was determined no further treatment isnecessary.'' Four days later, he told a news conference that the``pimple'' had been skin cancer.   _Jan. 17, 1986: Reagan had three small polyps removed from hisintestine during a six-hour visit to Bethesda in his first majorpost- cancer colonoscopy checkup. They were described as ``verysmall,'' measuring 1 millimeter to 2 millimeters in size.   A shaving of facial tissue from a growth on the right side ofReagan's face was also taken. Lab tests showed that the three polypsand facial tissue were benign.   _June 21, 1986: In a five-hour visit to Bethesda, Reagan had twosmall polyps removed from his colon. The growths, ranging in sizefrom 1 millimeter to 1.5 millimeters, were benign.

John Hutton, said tests ``show no evidence of a recurrence ofthe cancer found in July 1985.''   _Jan. 5, 1987: Reagan underwent successful prostate surgery. Thesurgery, which removed nearly an ounce of tissue, was to relievewhat a spokesman called ``mild, recurring discomfort'' apparentlydue to an enlarged prostate, a gland surrounding the urethra at thebase of the bladder.   _June 26, 1987: Reagan had two small polyps removed from hiscolon during an examination in the physician's office in the WhiteHouse. They were found to be benign. Dr. Hutton, said a routineprostate exam was also performed as a follow-up to the president'sJanuary surgery, and it ``was found to be entirely normal.''   _Jan. 7, 1989: Reagan underwent surgery on his left ring fingerto correct a curvature known as Dupuytren's Contracture, a commonbut deforming condition that caused his finger to fold inward.   _July 4, 1989, Reagan, an accomplished rider, was thrown from ahorse while visiting a Mexican ranch near Cananea, about 30 milessouth of the Arizona border. He was flown by Army helicpter to aU.S. military hospital in Arizona and kept about four hours,declining a doctor's suggestion that he remain overnight forobservation.</TEXT></DOC>
