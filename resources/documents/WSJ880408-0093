Rusher may be in his last year as publisher of National Review, but he is not retiring from the political wars. His latest book, &quot;The Coming Battle for the Media: Curbing the Power of the Media Elite&quot; (Morrow, 228 pages, $18.95), speaks for those on the right who believe the time is at hand to put legal clout behind their longstanding criticism of liberal bias in American journalism.    Mr. Rusher maintains that the weighty print and broadcast organs have evolved beyond what the framers had in mind when they explicitly protected press freedom in the First Amendment. He argues Big Media now resembles a fourth branch of government (or is allied with a leftish Congress) and ought to be subject to checks as are the other branches.    A lawyer himself, Mr. Rusher offers a sophisticated treatment of media prejudices. Yet too much of this volume is a cut-and-paste job culled from other critiques. Too much use is made of press-bashing cliches such as Janet Cooke's composite &quot;Jimmy,&quot; and too much of the book is set in periods past (Joe McCarthy, Goldwater) when the author was a bigger fish in a smaller conservative pond.    But Mr. Rusher effectively attacks the abuse of unnamed sources by the Washington press corps with an apropos Iran-Contra example of a William Casey memo on a White House meeting on back-channel contacts, arms and hostages. It was portrayed as a blueprint for deceiving the American public by a front-page New York Times story that relied on a filter, &quot;a highranking government official who has seen the document.&quot; Surfacing later in the Tower Report, the actual document proved more ambiguous.    As a response to such distortions, Mr. Rusher argues that reporters and their unidentified sources shouldn't necessarily be protected from official inquiries. But he isn't through there. After sketching a realistic scenario of a prolonged U.S. invasion of Nicaragua, in which hostile media coverage begins to wither initial public support, Mr. Rusher asks whether controls -- even prior restraint -- can't legitimately be invoked by the commander-in-chief in order to maintain &quot;morale&quot; at home.    Although he writes that his &quot;reflections&quot; aren't meant to be a platform for action, it is to administrative law and ultimately the courts that &quot;The Coming Battle for the Media&quot; is leading us.    One would think that the Supreme Court's &quot;Pentagon papers&quot; decision wouldn't leave much room for such solutions, but Mr. Rusher has a longer view, stressing that the judiciary (properly manned, one gathers) can outlast the journalists.    The author also is sympathetic to measures that would force newspapers to allocate &quot;equal time&quot; to aggrieved parties. (These also have run afoul of the courts.) To Mr. Rusher's disapproval, the broadcast equivalent of this counterweight, the Fairness Doctrine, is falling into disuse, although congressional forces (mostly liberals -- Mr. Rusher fails to note the irony) are trying to revive it.    This book is another helpful piece of evidence in separating conservatives such as Mr. Rusher from libertarians when it comes to using government power to achieve common ends. No serious, disinterested observer ought to dispute that most in the media today hold political views best characterized as reformist-liberal. Libertarians suffer from this bias as much as anyone, but they do not answer with briefs for state remedies.    Rather, they tend to point to the power of ideas and ever-growing criticism to challenge the reigning Zeitgeist. (To his credit, Mr. Rusher cites these possibilities as well, but implies they're insufficient for the &quot;battle&quot; at hand.) Here, the outlook isn't entirely bleak. Although this book barely notices, the right's dominance of policy analysis in recent years shows itself on many of the nation's op-ed pages.    Progress in getting individualist thinkers hired in news journalism has been slower. Greatly to blame is their lack of technical competence (the book cites this, as well as some efforts to remedy it). But the answer lies at the top as well as the bottom. If more publishers were averse to statism, the press would have a different look. Indeed, if only current publishers would insist on a greater role in the staffing of their papers -- the journalism reviews be damned -- we'd see a more lively mix, such as some other countries enjoy.    In this country, the most outrageous cases of one-sided news judgment and arrogance occur in broadcasting, especially at the Big Three networks. Reinforced by soulless corporate advertisers, they are going to take an earthquake to shake. But no equal-time or restraining law is going to put a straighter &quot;spin&quot; on the basic product. Variety through technology may help.    In the meantime, books such as Mr. Rusher's help keep the problem in focus. Future works would benefit from taking note of the media world outside of New York and Washington, and from avoiding the several errors in names, titles and affiliations that give this one a flavor of carelessness that detracts from its partly worthwhile message.    ---   Mr. Ferguson is the Journal's editorial features editor. </TEXT></DOC>
