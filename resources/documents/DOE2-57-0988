<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-57-0988 </DOCNO><TEXT>Thallium-201 is generally used for intravenous myocardial scintiscanning.In the 42 patients investigated during the study, the sensitivity ofthis method in the diagnosis of reduced myocardial perfusion was judgedto be superior to that of exercise electrocardiography. The most reliableconclusions could, however, be drawn from the combined results of boththese non-invasive techniques. Coronary angiography was carried out forreasons of comparison and proved that the method under investigation,even though showing an extremely high sensitivity, was less satisfactoryas regards specifity. Myocardial scintiscanning using thallium-201 constitutesthe only non-invasive technique suitable for the evaluation of cardialmicrocirculation. It must therefore be regarded as an ideal diagnostictool to be used in combination with coronary angiography which, in turn,provides evidence of macroscopic changes. Moreover, myocardial scintiscanningusing thallium-201 still remains the only procedure permitting acutemyocardial infarction to be detected within the first few hours followingthe incident.
