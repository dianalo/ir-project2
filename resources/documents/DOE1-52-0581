This so-called Environmental Profile Analysis is a testsystem for the screening of chemicals for their environmental behavior.The test system consists of the following five tests: (1) bio-accumulationin algae; (2) bio-accumulation in fish; (3) retention, dispersion, andexcretion in rats (warm-blooded animals); (4) degradation, transformationand accumulation in activated sludge (microbial process); (5) photomineralization(abiotic process). The test system involves the use of radio-labeledtest materials. This allows the use of scintillation counting as theuniversal analytical method and avoids the significant analytical limitationsother methods are faced with. Also, the very sensitive method of scintillationcounting allows the detection of traces of test materials and/or transformationproducts. Difficulties and risks of the use of radioactive materialscan be eliminated by following strictly the procedures of the guidelines.A series of more than one hundred compounds belonging to widely differentclasses of compounds and displaying widely different application patternsand physicochemical properties has been tested so far. The test datafor all the parameters of the five tests can be graphically presentedcreating a profile of parameters. The profile of the unknown materialsis compared with the profile of compounds which are known to impose aburden on the environment. Potentially hazardous material is identifiedby similarities of the profiles and additional investigation should beperformed. Through this comparison of profiles, the ecotoxicologicalprofile analysis allows a quick recognition of potentially hazardouschemicals.</TEXT></DOC>
