Many of the women, blacks and whites, sat on the street andchanted freedom songs before police led or carried them into vans.   In Pretoria, eight blacks and two whites were arrested for tryingto desegregate the capital's whites-only buses, another phase of thedefiance campaign. The two whites were women who bought bus ticketsfor blacks.   Twice this week, shots have been fired into the homes oforganizers of the Pretoria campaign.   Police stopped the throng of placard-carrying women in Cape Townafter they emerged from a church hall to begin a march to theBritish Embassy. They intended to ask Britain to protest the SouthAfrican government's handling of student unrest in the Cape Townarea and to intercede on behalf of three black activists facingexecution for a 1986 killing.   In addition to Leah Tutu, those arrested included Mary Burton, awhite who heads the Black Sash civil rights group, and DorothyBoesak, wife of the Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent mixed-raceactivist who is president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.   Many of the marchers sat in a street adjoining a small plazauntil they were led into police vans and driven away. Scores ofonlookers cheered them.   Police said the women would be charged with participating in anillegal gathering.   A white activist involved in the defiance campaign, WillieHofmeyer, was admitted to a Cape Town hospital Wednesday withsuspected internal bleeding, his father said. Hofmeyer has been on ahunger strike since he was detained by police last week during aprotest at a branch of First National Bank, sponsor of an ongoingtour by an international rugby team which activists say violates thesports boycott of South Africa.   The South African Council of Churches, which supports thedefiance campaign, announced plans for an outdoor rally Saturday inSoweto, the vast black township outside Johannesburg. The churchcouncil's general secretary, the Rev. Frank Chikane, said the rallywas intended as a forum for blacks to express their opposition tothe white-controlled government in a peaceful manner.   Outdoor rallies are illegal unless authorized by the government,and Chikane said he hoped Saturday's event would be approved. Tutuand Boesak are among the scheduled speakers.   Before dawn Wednesday, a bomb exploded at the home of a member ofthe Indian chamber of Parliament, causing damage but no injuries.Police said the explosion wrecked a door and several windows at thehome of Ahomed Lambat in Alberton, southeast of Johannesburg. Therewas no claim of responsibility.
