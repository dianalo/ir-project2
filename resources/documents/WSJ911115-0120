As a result, the House will have to try again next week topass legislation to replenish the bank deposit insurance fundand tighten bank regulation. House Speaker Thomas Foley (D.,Wash.) said the new bill will be a narrower plan stripped ofcontroversial provisions that have led the House to rejecttwo banking bills in two weeks. The new measure, like thedefeated bills, will contain a $70 billion line of credit forthe bank deposit insurance fund, which is nearly insolvent.</LP><TEXT>   However, the Senate continued work last night on a billfilled with compromises that have resolved many of thecontentious issues, including branching, that have draggeddown the House bill. The possibility that the Senate will beable to pass a broader bill than the House keeps alive theprospects for some bank-law modernization this year.   The House bill that failed last night on a 227-191 votecontained a provision, strongly supported by the Treasury andthe insurance industry, that would have allowed banks tobranch nationwide but barred them from selling insurancenationwide. For this reason, the American Bankers Associationand the Independent Bankers Association, among others,lobbied hard against the bill. That pressure, along with manylawmakers' reluctance to vote for legislation that they fearcould create for banks a repeat of the savings-and-loancrisis, killed the bill.   The administration has threatened to veto any banking billthat doesn't contain a branching provision. The Treasuryclaims that giving BankAmerica Corp., NCNB Corp. and otherlarge banking organizations the right to consolidate theiroperations into nationwide branch networks is a major steptoward a more modern, efficient banking system. Oneconsultant has estimated that branching could save thebanking industry $10 billion annually.   But in an effort to win passage of interstate branching,the House leadership cut deals with the insurance and realtyinterests, two powerful lobbies, to protect them againstcompetition from banks. These measures turned most of thebanking industry against the bill.   Both Republicans and Democrats privately criticized theBush administration for failing to lobby effectively forelements of the broad banking reform plan it presented inFebruary. Important initiatives -- a bid to allow commercialfirms to own banks, expanded securities and insurance powersfor banks, and nationwide branching -- have been amputatedfrom the bill by a House that seems afraid of granting banksnew powers during the worst banking crisis since theDepression.   Yesterday, the Senate eliminated as too controversial aprovision that would allow banks to expand into thesecurities business. It adopted a plan to allow banks to setup nationwide branching networks within three years, withbanks allowed to enter new states primarily by acquiringexisting banks. The Senate also adopted an importantcompromise on insurance that gives national banks expandedauthority to sell insurance in many states but bars the saleof insurance nationwide. Like the House bill, the Senatemeasure includes new money for the bank insurance fund and anumber of regulations designed to reduce the threat of bankfailure and slow the drain on the bank deposit insurancefund.   Other common provisions in a narrow House bill and theSenate bill would bar the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.from reimbursing uninsured accounts -- those above $100,000and foreign deposits -- after 1994. It also would restrictthe Federal Reserve Board's ability to keep sick banks alivewith long-term loans.   But the Bush administration has opposed a narrow Housebill that doesn't give banks powers to expand theiroperations and earn higher profits.   The House amendment containing the branching and insuranceprovisions actually passed on a 210-208 vote. But when theamendment was combined into a package that many lawmakerssaid didn't go far enough to reform the banking system, thebill failed.   One problem is that the Treasury, in its eagerness to winnationwide branching, agreed to support a package that mostof the banking industry opposed, thus abandoning itsstrongest allies when it needed them most.</TEXT></DOC>
