The proposal, he said, ``can totally sabotage the agreement.''   He said Algeria, Nigeria and Libya also opposed changing the $18benchmark. Barkeshli said he met for two hours Sunday with OPECPresident Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, but said afterward: ``I am verypessimistic.''   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said the proposed $15benchmark was intended to prevent further price erosion.   ``What we wanted is even to eliminate a reference to the $18,just in case under the best of circumstances ... the price mighteven go beyond $18,'' he told reporters late Sunday.   Nazer insisted he would not back down from his stand.   Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, announced in Tehranearlier Sunday that he would accept the deal to cut the cartel'soutput and drive up prices.   But Barkeshli said Aghazadeh agreed to a preliminary draft thatwould retain OPEC's $18 benchmark.   The announcement last week that the ministers tentatively reacheda new output pact sent prices higher. Brent North Sea crude rose$1.65 a barrel to close Friday at $14.42.   Prices have been running $4 or more below the $18 target due to aworld oil glut.   Each $1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means anincrease of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, althoughoil companies do not always pass along the full increase.   The agreement, which would set member quotas, would cut OPECproduction from the current estimated 22.5 million barrels a day to18.5 million barrels a day in the first half of next year.   Barkeshli told reporters that Saudi Arabia made two proposalsSunday morning.   The Iranian delegate said one would set a target price at $15 abarrel and the other would set a price band ranging from $15 to $18.This, he said, ``is a major divergence from OPEC resolutions sofar.''   ``We're not going to concede to any new elements whatsoever,'' hesaid.   Barkeshli said the plan worked out with Aghazadeh ``did not haveanything like $15'' and that the Iranian Cabinet approved theoriginal draft with the $18 reference price.   Aghazadeh left Vienna Friday to try to sell the package to hisgovernment. Barkeshli said Aghazadeh will not return to Vienna.   The OPEC ministers had been scheduled to resume formaldiscussions Sunday, but they were postponed until Monday.   The price issue in the accord, which would replace one arrangedin 1986, is critical. Many OPEC countries need as much money aspossible from their oil sales.   Iran and Iraq want additional revenues to rebuild theireconomies, which were badly damaged in their 8-year-old war. Theyagreed to an August cease-fire.   Under the new agreement, Iran and Iraq would each get the samequota of 2.64 million barrels a day.   The issue of parity had been a sticking point in discussions ofthe cartel's winter meeting, which began Nov. 21. Iraq has beendemanding an equal production ceiling with Iran. Aghazadeh hadrepeatedly said no.   Saudi Arabia maintains the largest share at about a quarter ofthe cartel's total output.   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
