In the first type of analysis ANOVA wasused to examine the mean Thematic Mapper band one count by ecophysicalstrata. The primary difference in the two ecophysical strata is the soiltype and depth over the underlying bedrock. Examination of the Augustto May difference values for TM band one produced similar results. GroupA and B strata were the same as above. The third type of analysis examinedthe relationship between values of the August to May difference frompolygons which have similar ecophysical properties with the exceptionof sulfate deposition. For this case lakes were selected from units withsandy soils over granitic rock types and the sulfate deposition was 1.5or 2.5 g/sq m/yr.</TEXT></DOC>
