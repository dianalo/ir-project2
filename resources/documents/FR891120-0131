Amendment 2 establishes a regulatory amendment procedurefor the future implementation of specified types of gear and harvest restrictionsapplicable to the fishery in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and makesother minor changes to the FMP. The intended effects of the procedure areto provide a more flexible and timely system implementing rules governingthe conduct of the spiny lobster fishery, enhance cooperative Florida (State)/Federalmanagement, reduce Federal management costs, improve the effectivenessof necessary rules, and presumably increase productivity from the resource.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>Amendment 2 was approved on October 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Michael E. Justen, 813-893-3722.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The spiny lobster fishery is managedunder the FMP, prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic FisheryManagement Councils (Councils), and its implementing regulations at 50CFR part 640, under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservationand Management Act (Magnuson Act). Amendment 2 to the FMP was submittedby the Councils on July 19, 1989. A notice of availability of the amendmentand request for comments was published on July 26, 1989 (54 FR 31063).A proposed rule to implement Amendment 2 was published on August 24, 1989(54 FR 35212).The FMP manages the spiny lobster fishery throughout the EEZ off the coastalstates from the Virginia/North Carolina border south and through the Gulfof Mexico. The preamble to the proposed rule contained information on thefishery, discussed the proposed regulatory changes, and analyzed the benefitsof the proposed changes. That information is not repeated here.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Responses</ITAG>Four written responses were received commenting on the proposed rule andamendment. Two Federal agencies, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Departmentof Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, recommended approval of Amendment2. The Organized Fishermen of Florida (OFF), an organization that representscommercial fishermen, recommended that changes to the commercial gear andharvest restrictions be made by amendment of the FMP rather than by regulatoryamendment initiated by the Florida Marine Fisheries Commission (FMFC).OFF does not believe that the FMFC has the capability to evaluate potentialeconomic and social impacts of the critical measures in the detail requiredto meet the Federal requirements and does not allow ample and fair opportunityfor public input into the State rulemaking process. A local chamber ofcommerce expressed concerns about the potential for adverse impacts resultingfrom future changes to the gear and harvest restrictions. NOAA disagreeswith both concerns. Submission of proposed regulations addressing gearand harvest restrictions under the regulatory amendment process does notconstitute automatic approval and implementation of such regulations inthe EEZ. Supporting analyses prepared by the FMFC must meet the requirementsof the Magnuson Act and other applicable Federal law before the proposedregulations can become effective in the EEZ. The public will have the sameopportunity to comment on proposed gear and harvest restrictions, and tohave those comments considered in NOAA's decision as to whether and inwhat form any proposed restrictions should be issued, as it does underall other proceedings carried out under the rulemaking provisions of theAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. Furthermore, the proceduresestablished by Amendment 2 require that the FMFC also inform the Councilsof each recommended rule and supporting analysis. If either Council determinesthat a rule is not consistent with the Magnuson Act or the FMP, and soinforms the Regional Director, NOAA cannot proceed with rulemaking underAmendment 2 until the Council withdraws its objection.Concomitant with the proposed regulatory amendment procedure for changingcertain gear and harvest limitations, Amendment 2 also (1) amends and addsto the issues of the ``Problems and Issues in the Fishery'' identifiedin the FMP; (2) adds to the FMP a ``Management Objective'' to provide fora more flexible management system that minimizes regulatory delay, thusassuring more effective, cooperative State and Federal management of thefishery; (3) modifies the statement of optimum yield to remove numericallyspecified minimum legal carapace and tail lengths, thus permitting modificationof those lengths by the regulatory amendment process contained in Amendment2; (4) adds a ``Vessel Safety'' section; and (5) updates the ``Habitatof the Stocks'' section. No comments were received on these changes andadditions.Based on the comments received, NOAA finds no basis for disapproval ofthe amendment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Changes From the Proposed Rule</ITAG>The proposed rule would have codified the procedure for the future implementationof specified types of gear and harvest restrictions applicable to the spinylobster fishery in the EEZ. That procedure would apply only to the FloridaMarine Fisheries Commission, the Councils, and NMFS but is not regulatoryin nature because it does not control the behavior of fishermen. Accordingly,NOAA has concluded that regulatory language is not necessary to implementthe procedure. NOAA chose to publish the procedure as a proposed rule asthe most effective means of notifying persons who would be affected andobtaining public comments. Accordingly, while Amendment 2 has been approved,the proposed rule has been withdrawn, by a notice appearing elsewhere inthis issue, in view of NOAA's conclusion that regulatory language is unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Secretary of Commerce determined that Amendment 2 is necessary forthe conservation and management of the spiny lobster fishery and that itis consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law.The Councils prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for Amendment 2and, based on the EA, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA,concluded that there will be no significant adverse impact on the humanenvironment as a result of Amendment 2.Since Amendment 2 has no implementing regulations, preparation of and conclusionsbased on a regulatory impact review (RIR)/regulatory flexibility analysis(RFA), normally required by E.O. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act,are not required. It should be noted, however, that each future actioninitiated under the procedure established in Amendment 2 will be accompaniedby an RIR and, if it will have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities, an RFA will be prepared.The Councils determined that Amendment 2 is consistent to the maximum extentpracticable with the approved coastal zone management programs of Alabama,Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Georgiaand Texas do not have approved coastal zone management programs. This determinationwas submitted for review by the responsible state agencies under section307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act. Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina,Mississippi, and South Carolina agreed with the Councils' determination.Alabama did not comment within the statutory time period, and, therefore,consistency is automatically implied.Amendment 2 does not contain a collection-of-information requirement forpurposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act.The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Intergovernmental Affairsdetermined that Amendment 2 and the proposed rule had sufficient federalismimplications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment (FA). TheFA concluded that Amendment 2 is consistent with the principles, criteria,and requirements of E.O. 12612 and will reduce the governmental costs ofmanaging the spiny lobster fishery in Florida's waters and the EEZ withoutincreasing costs to the industry or consumers.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 640</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et</T3> <T3>seq</T3>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
