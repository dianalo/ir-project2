L. 99-339,June 19, 1986) provides for the safety of drinking water supplies throughoutthe United States, and its territories, by requiring establishment andenforcement of national primary drinking water regulations under the PublicWater System Supervision (PWSS) Program. The Act provides EPA with theauthority to provide financial assistance to States to support their drinkingwater programs through Federal grants awarded annually out of appropriatedfunds for each fiscal year.The dollar amount of Federal grant assistance for which each State hasbeen eligible has been determined by applying a grant formula, consistingof a number of weighted factors, to the amount of grant dollars appropriatedfor the specific fiscal year. Since fiscal year 1980, the factors comprisingthe grant formula are population (weight factor 30%), land area (weightfactor 10%), the number of community water systems (weight factor 48%),and the number of non-community water systems (weight factor 12%) (44 FR7143, February 6, 1979). The SDWA directs that no State or Territory allotment,except Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands, shall be less than1% of the total annual grant appropriation unless EPA reduces such percentageby regulation, which it has not done until today's rulemaking. For example,if the total appropriation for a fiscal year was $33,450,000 (as is thecase for FY 1989), then no State or Territory allotment, except for Guam,American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands, could be less than $334,500, regardlessof what amount was computed by the weighted factors. Although no minimumwas established by Congress for Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands,EPA previously has determined that these territories' allotments shallbe not less than \1/3\%. Additionally, EPA previously has determined thatthe allotment for the Northern Mariana Islands also shall be not less than\1/3\%.By this rule EPA is no longer guaranteeing States a 1% minimum share ofthe amount that fiscal year appropriations for the PWSS program exceedthe fiscal year 1989 appropriation. Instead, States will receive an allotmentof 1% of an amount equivalent to the FY 1989 appropriation plus, if thereis an excess, a proportionate share of the excess based upon the grantformula in effect for fiscal years after fiscal year 1989.By this rule EPA also is adding the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands(Republic of Palau), which is included in the term ``State'' under section1401(13) of the SDWA, to those States which may be allotted less than 1%of the total annual appropriation for fiscal years after fiscal year 1989.For PWSS grants the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands has consistedof Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau; its minimum annual allotmenthas been 1%. The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands now only consistsof the Republic of Palau as the other two have entered into a relationshipof Free Association with the United States. EPA, pursuant to section 104(c)of the Compact of Free Association, Approval (Pub. L. 99-658), has phasedout funding for the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islandsfor FY 1989. EPA has determined as a matter of policy that the Republicof Palau's allotment shall be a minimum of \1/3\% of the FY 1989 appropriationplus, if there is an excess, a proportionate share of the excess basedupon the grant formula in effect for fiscal years after fiscal year 1989.If Palau adopts the Compact, its grant funding will be phased out in amanner similar to that used for the Federated States of Micronesia andthe Marshall Islands.I. Rationale for ChangeEPA is initiating this rule change to achieve a more equitable distributionof grant resources to the States because there is a great disparity offunding caused by the 1% minimum requirement. Although every State mustshoulder increased workload to meet new Federal drinking water mandates,the ``minimum'' States in FY 1989 are receiving an average of nearly threetimes as many grant dollars per public water system as do the non-minimumStates. EPA believes that 1% of the FY 1989 appropriation is a reasonableallotment to operate effective State drinking water programs. If futurefiscal year appropriations increase after fiscal year 1989, EPA will providethat every State share any increase proportionately based upon the grantformula in effect in such fiscal years.In FY 1988, EPA's Inspector General's (IG) Office conducted an audit forcertain program areas within the Office of Drinking Water (Report of Audit-Elhw7-03-0171-81928_Non-CommunityWater System Program). One of its concerns centered upon the PWSS grantallocation formula and, specifically, the required 1% minimum allotmentof appropriated funds per State. Its audit concluded that the 1% minimumexceeded an acceptable base level, considering the limited amount of Federalfunds. The IG recommendation was that EPA should issue regulations, asallowed by the SDWA, reducing the 1% minimum funding for all States, inorder to direct more of the available funds to the States with the greatestneed.The Assistant Administrator for Water advised the IG that other alternativesto the 1% minimum funding for States would be considered, along with thepossibility of revising the factor weights. The preamble and the regulationpromulgated today reflect the Agency's decision concerning these matters.II. Changes in Formula40 CFR 35.115(e), Public Water System Supervision Allotment (Safe DrinkingWater Act, section 1443(a)), currently provides that a State's allotmentis to be based upon the State's population, geographic area, numbers ofcommunity and non-community water systems, and other relevant factors.However, no State except American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands,or the Virgin Islands may be allotted less than 1% of the total.The PWSS grant formula for FY 1990 and beyond reflects several changesfrom the fiscal year 1989 formula. The first modification requires changingthe regulatory provision cited above dealing with the minimum allotmentavailable to States. In previous years the minimum was 1% of the annualPWSS appropriation. After careful consideration of many State and EPA viewpointsexpressed on this subject, EPA has determined that a more equitable allotmentof resources would be to guarantee States an allotment of 1% of the FY1989 appropriation, except for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern MarianaIslands, the Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islandswhich shall each receive a minimum of \1/3\% of the FY 1989 appropriationplus, if there is an excess, a proportionate share of the excess basedupon the grant formula in effect for fiscal years after fiscal year 1989.If the appropriations increase above the FY 1989 level ($33,450,000), thenany increase would be allotted to the States and insular areas by grantformula in effect for fiscal years after fiscal year 1989. States wouldnot be guaranteed a 1% minimum of the entire annual appropriation. Insularareas would not be guaranteed a \1/3\% minimum of the entire annual appropriation.All State and insular area allotments would increase if an increase inthe PWSS grant appropriation for FY 1990 occurs. Should there be a decreasein the annual appropriation below the FY 1989 level, the 1% minimum wouldremain in effect. In such event, States would receive a minimum allotmentof 1% of the annual appropriation except for American Samoa, Guam, theNorthern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory ofthe Pacific Islands which would each receive a minimum of \1/3\%.The second modification to the grant formula, which does not require arevision to 40 CFR subpart A, concerns the factor weights. The currentPWSS grant formula consists of four weighted factors:(1) Number of Community Water Systems (48%)(2) Number of Non-Community Water Systems (12%)(3) Population (30%)(4) Land Area (10%)EPA has concluded that for fiscal years beginning after FY 1989 it is appropriateto revise the grant formula to reflect the following weights and factors:(1) Number of Community Water Systems (56%)(2) Number of Non-Community Water Systems (14%)(3) Population (20%)(4) Land Area (10%)A study conducted for the Office of Drinking Water in 1988 was designedto determine whether the current grant formula adequately reflected theexisting State workloads. The study concluded that where States had equivalentpopulation totals, those with more public water systems had the greaterworkload. The study also concluded that the ratio of State resources requiredfor a community water system (CWS) versus a non-community water system(NCWS) should remain at 4 to 1. The study recommended that more emphasisbe placed upon the number of public water systems within the State, andless emphasis on the population totals within the State. EPA has decidedto adopt those recommendations. As a result, the weighting factor for populationis being reduced from 30% to 20%. The weighting factor for a CWS is beingincreased from 48% to 56% and the weighting factor for a NCWS is beingincreased from 12% to 14%. The weighting factor for land area remains unchangedat 10%.The final modification concerns the treatment of non-transient, non-communityWater Systems (NTNCWS). A NTNCWS is a public water system that is not aCWS and regularly serves at least 25 of the same persons over six monthsper year. These systems used to be classed simply as NCWSs and were subjectto very few regulatory requirements. As EPA promulgates new and revisedNational Primary Drinking Water Regulations over the next few years, theNTNCWSs will be subject to many more requirements than will other NCWSs.State oversight efforts will necessarily shift as the NTNCWSs become subjectto more of the drinking water regulations over the coming years. EPA believesthat the grant allotment formula should reflect this shift in oversightand should change the grant weighting of the NTNCWSs from the current NCWSto that of a CWS. EPA plans to phase in this weighting shift over the nextthree years. For each State in FY 1990, one-third of its NTNCWSs will beweighted as a CWS, and two-thirds will be weighted as a NCWS. In FY 1991,two-thirds of the NTNCWSs will be weighted as a CWS, and one-third as aNCWS. By FY 1992, all NTNCWSs will be weighted as a CWS.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Effective Date</ITAG>This regulation is effective September 29, 1989. The sole purpose of thisrule is to codify policies and procedures for financial assistance awardedby EPA under the SDWA. Accordingly, this is a grants-related rule and theAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(a), does not require that itbe published, in proposed form, prior to promulgation.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a new regulation is``major'' and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis. These amendments do not satisfy any of the criteria the ExecutiveOrder specifies for major rulemaking. Therefore, this is not subject toa Regulatory Impact Analysis.This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any comments from OMBand EPA response to those comments are available for public inspectionat the EPA Public Information Reference Unit, Room 2904, U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
