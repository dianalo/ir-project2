(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Whether they greet it with enthusiasm or alarm, most high-end color shops arethinking desktop.andM;By Steve HannafordandM;&quot;All our clients -- design shops and agencies -- are starting to producepages on the desktop, and they are pushing us into desktop-based color,&quot; saidChuck Weger, technical director for The Lanman Companies of Washington, D.C.,andO;one of the largest color pre-press companies in the United States.andP;  Lanman'shigh-end Hell and Scitex pre-press systems aren't threatened today, Wegermaintains, &quot;but we know that desktop color production will be a significantfactor in our business two or three years down the line.&quot;andM;With varying degrees of skepticism or enthusiasm, the great majority ofhigh-end color-trade shops are gearing up to generate professional-qualitycolor from Mac-produced files.andP;  And while the timetable varies, trade-shopmanagers have little doubt that some form of PostScript imagesetting is intheir future, if it hasn't already arrived.andM;PostScript postponed.andP;  Experts generally agreed that several obstacles haveto be overcome before pure PostScript output becomes a major part of thecolor-trade business.andP;  For example, trapping (the proper adjustment ofadjoining colors) is a serious weakness in the current systems, professionalssaid.andM;Other complaints deal with familiar desktop color woes: the difficulty ofdealing with large files, the problem of moires caused by PostScript halftonegeneration and the limited color range of desktop scanners.andP;  In addition,although color-correction and retouching programs such as Adobe Photoshop andLetraset's ColorStudio are very good first efforts, they still aren'tsufficient for the task of serious color production work, according to manyprofessionals.andM;An even more immediate problem may be the unpredictability of PostScript withfiles that simply won't print for no easily discernible reason.andM;Even a strong desktop proponent, Sam Bianco, system manager at Tukaiz LithoInc. of Franklin Park, Ill., admitted that his staff &quot;can spend more timeunraveling screwed-up files than it took the client to create in the firstplace.&quot; With problem files limiting productivity, many managers saidPostScript is just not ready for the serious throughput they need.andM;Forging forward.andP;  Yet despite these criticisms, the universal opinion voicedby trade-shop managers was that the snags will be fixed within a few yearsand that a significant portion of the business, even from their mostdemanding customers, will be moving to PostScript.andP;  While none of themanagers said they believed that PostScript systems would replace high-endpre-press stations (see box, this page, for Mac links to high-end pre-press),they all said that PostScript would operate in parallel with their currentoperations, just as camera separations and dot etching continue to coexistwith the electronic systems.andM;Many shops already have made the move to PostScript.andP;  &quot;We are being driveninto PostScript because our clients want it,&quot; said Chris Jackson, technologyvice president for Harper House, a Dallas-based separation shop.andP;  The companyhas added Macs and an Agfa 9800 imagesetter to its Hell scanners and colorequipment.andP;  &quot;We see it as an opportunity to expand our business to newmarkets.&quot;andM;Tukaiz Litho offers a wide variety of routes for high-quality page assembly:high-end separation and page assembly on a Crosfield Studio System; outputfrom Crosfield Lightspeed System, a Mac-based page-layout program thatoutputs to the high-end pre-press system; Crosfield Lightspeed's Studio Link,which rasterizes any PostScript graphics or text, from Adobe Illustrator orAldus PageMaker, for example, and links it to the Crosfield system; and scansfrom the company's Optronics ColorGetter as well as direct PostScript outputto its Optronics ColorSetter.andP;  &quot;Which approach our customers use all dependson the nature of the job, the budget, the schedule and the requirements ofthe customer,&quot; Bianco said.andM;While more and more trade shops are offering full PostScript output as anoption, other companies remain skeptical about the quality or, more often,the productivity of current PostScript systems and still do virtually alltheir production on high-end page-assembly systems.andP;  But during the pastyear, a growing segment of these companies' business has been channeledthrough PostScript RIPs (raster image processors) that take desktop files andrender them into a format that can be used on the high-end systems.andP;  Theseinclude Scitex America Corp.'s VIP, Crosfield's Studio Link, Hell GraphicSystems Inc.'s ScriptMaster, Screaming Color Inc.'s RIPLink and AtexPublishing Systems' new ColorPort, as well as some proprietary, home-grownPostScript translators.andP;  Page layouts, type and line art from clients arethen combined with the corrected and finished color images on the high-endpre-press workstation.andM;For some companies, the rasterizing of PostScript files has become a minorindustry in itself.andM;Techtron Imaging Network, based in Chicago, is the largest graphics companyin the nation.andP;  Among the company's many divisions, encompassing some 70 U.S.andO;sites, several of its major-city studios are dedicated to rasterizing digitalfiles submitted by clients for later processing on high-end systems.andO;Techtron uses its satellite-based network to dispatch these rasterized filesaround the country.andM;A matter of time.andP;  All the trade shops we surveyed, even those not producingPostScript output now, were preparing for the day when they will.andP;  Someinsist that their customers aren't quite ready for the risks that 100 percentPostScript color involves.andM;&quot;We are committed to working with our client base,&quot; said Alan Darling,general manager of Quad Text, a division of Quad Graphics based in Peewaukee,Wis.andP;  &quot;When they are ready to go into full-scale PostScript, we will beready, too.&quot; Meanwhile, the company &quot;strongly encourages&quot; the use of the Macfor preparing files and generating comps, then linking the results to Scitexsystems for page assembly.andP;  Quad also has an Optronics ColorSetter in-house,which it uses primarily to prepare type for stripping into pages.andM;Lanman, which has sites from Washington to Tampa, Fla., also has been usingits imagesetting equipment and PostScript know-how for limited purposes sofar.andP;  The company outputs type and color-tint work on its L-300 but is notyet ready to make full use of its imagesetter for continuous-tone artwork,Weger said.andM;Across the country, these companies are hiring PostScript experts tocomplement their professional color staffs.andP;  Harper House &quot;hired on aMac/PostScript person in production a year ago and recently hired a salesconsultant with a solid Macintosh background,&quot; Harper's Jackson said.andM;Lanman has been involved with PostScript since its beginnings, Weger said,and it recently acquired a whole PostScript service-bureau operation at itsWashington location.andP;  And Techtron last year brought in Hawkey andAssociates, a Chicago consulting and training group, to set up and supportdesktop links for all its branches.andM;So whether they are enthusiastic like Bianco (&quot;We get comparable quality onour Optronics imagesetter to our high-end output&quot;), hopeful like consultantGary Hawkey (&quot;The current PostScript machines are on the cusp of beingviable&quot;) or wary like Darling (&quot;We are keeping our head below the trenchesuntil the worst is over&quot;), the high-end color trade seems convinced thatexpertise in PostScript and the Macintosh will be critical in the comingyears.andM;PostScript-to-high-end links allow virtually any PostScript file to be&quot;RIPped&quot; (raster image processed) and output with high-end scans.andP;  Systemsinclude:andM;VIPandM;Scitex America Corp.andM;8 Oak Park DriveandM;Bedford, Mass.andP;  01730andM;Phone (617) 275-5150andM;Fax (617) 275-3430andM;Studio LinkandM;Crosfield LightspeedandM;47 Farnsworth St.andM;Boston, Mass.andP;
