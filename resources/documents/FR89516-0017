Prior to the enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of1987, subsection (h) of section 119 provided:<ITAG tagnum="21">(h) No assistance may be provided under this section for projectsintended to facilitate the relocation of industrial or commercial plantsor facilities from one area to another, unless the Secretary finds thatthe relocation does not significantly and adversely affect the unemploymentor economic base of the area from which the industrial or commercial plantor facility is to be relocated.</ITAG>The foregoing prohibition is reflected in the UDAG program regulation at24 CFR 570.456(c), which provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Except as specified herein, no assistance will be provided forprojects intended to facilitate the relocation of industrial or commercialplants or facilities from one area to another, unless the Secretary findsthat such relocation does not significantly and adversely affect the levelof unemployment or the economic base of the area from which such industrialor commercial plant or facility is to be relocated. However, moves withina metropolitan area shall not be subject to this provision.</ITAG>The amended section 119(h) at section 516 of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1987 (Pub.

The restrictions established inparagraph (2) shall not apply if the Secretary determines that the relocationor expansion does not significantly and adversely affect the employmentor economic base of the city, county, or community from which the relocationor expansion occurs.</ITAG>When the Department learned that some speculative space projects (projectsin which the occupants of all or some of the space are not identified inthe application for the UDAG) involved marketing of speculative space topotential relocatees of nearby areas, HUD issued a Statement of Policyconcerning applications for projects containing speculative space. 50 FR1505 (January 11, 1985). The Statement of Policy was designed to be usedby UDAG applicants as a guide and advisory interpretation of section 119(h)as it applies to applications for development of speculative space. Theeffect of the 1987 statutory amendment generally is to retain the applicabilityof the previously existing provisions of section 119(h) to speculativespace projects.On May 18, 1988, the Department published proposed rules setting out HUDpolicy on applications for development of speculative space and implementingsection 516 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 as itpertains to applications for development of projects with identified intendedoccupants. Interested parties were given until June 17, 1988 to commenton the proposed rules. Seven responses were received. All the commentshave been reviewed and their disposition is discussed below.Section 570.456(c)(1) Applications for Projects With Speculative SpaceSection 570.456(c)(1) concerns application of the business relocation prohibitionto proposed projects with speculative space. It was modified by section516 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 but the statutorymodification incorporates the essential elements of the 1985 Statementof Policy. An objection was made to the metropolitan area exclusion inparagraph (c)(1) for application of the prohibition against use of UDAGfunds for speculative projects intended to facilitate a relocation, onthe grounds that the metropolitan area exclusion is unwarranted by statutoryconstruction and is inconsistent with the legislative history. The metropolitanarea exclusion, which is derived from the original legislative historyfor 1977, has been in the UDAG regulations since initially promulgated.If Congress chose to restrict or further limit the exclusion it could havedone so in section 516 of the Housing and Community Development Act of1987 when other changes were made in the prohibition against UDAG fundingof business relocations, and the Department believes the thrust of therecent Congressional action and the legislative history (House Committeeon Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, H.R. 95-236) supports retentionof the longstanding exclusion. To limit the exclusion to transfers withinan applicant's jurisdiction ignores the legislative history, which recognizedthat private investment in one jurisdiction in a metropolitan area mayresult in loss of commercial or employment activity in another.Several respondents expressed concern that the paragraph (c)(1)(i) presumptionthat a proposed speculative project is intended to facilitate a relocationmay be employed as the exclusive means of applying the prohibition againstUDAG funding for speculative space projects. However, no detailed alternativetests were recommended. The practice of the Department in determining whetherthe presumption is present (as announced in the 1985 Statement of Policy)has been to review all facts and materials submitted by applicants andparties claiming that the prohibition must be applied.Concern was also expressed that the Department would limit its review ofa pattern of job movement to the jobs of only one employer in paragraph(c)(1)(i)(A). HUD does not limit the review of patterns of job movementto the same employer. Rather, the Department considers jobs of the sameclass or category in determining whether a pattern is present, and HUDrecognizes that a variety of fact patterns can lead to a presumption thatthere is an intention to facilitate a relocation. Other economic factorswould be considered.One respondent submitted that the area from which a pattern of job movementmay be found to occur should not be limited to 50 miles but should be thetrade area of the business to be located in the proposed speculative spaceproject. The Department continues to believe that 50 miles contains anarea adequate to fairly and reasonably measure any pattern of job movement.The respondent also argued that under paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) the time periodfor measuring the pattern should be extended to include the time periodafter the project is completed, since the negative effect resulting injob movement may only occur after the project is completed. The regulationis, however, intended to permit review of existing patterns which are likelyto continue in order to find a presumption in regard to speculative spaceprojects. Possible new future patterns of movement are simply too uncertainto be measured in regard to establishing the presumption of a prohibitedrelocation. Another concern about the ``pattern of job movement'' measure was that``similar relevant factors'' in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) are too narrow.The regulation requires review of ``measurable comparisons'' in consideringwhether the presumption applies, and the Department believes that the presentlanguage permits review of all data germane to the issue of whether a patternof job movement will likely continue. Several respondents expressed concern about the proper placement of theburden of proof in finding the presumption of intention to relocate, andabout the applicant's right to rebut such a presumption. The argument ismade that if there is a<T3> prima facie</T3> showing of intention to relocate the burden mustshift to the applicant to prove that there will not be a relocation. However,it must be recognized that the UDAG statute is designed to assist distressedcities and that the prohibition of funding projects intended to facilitatea relocation is an exception to the larger purpose of the Act. The experienceof the Department has demonstrated that parties opposing a project arequite capable of providing voluminous materials assembled to show suchan intention. Where any questions concerning a possible relocation in violationof 119(h) are raised in the application or in the review of the applicationby the Department, all relevant data will be weighed in making any determinationas to the presence of the presumption or, if present, the rebuttal of itby the applicant. The Department believes that the moving party (i.e.,either the proponent or opponent, depending on who is required to submitthe evidence) has the burden of proof. As recommended by one of the respondents, the Department is modifying andSection;570.458(c)(14)(iv) to require that the applicant (as well as the projectdeveloper) must certify that to the best of its knowledge the requestedUDAG funds will not facilitate a prohibited business relocation. This changewill assist the city in focusing on the relocation funding prohibition.Where appropriate, the applicant may be required to offer evidence in supportof its certification. The certification requirement will not be furtherexpanded in the rule to require every identified intended occupant to certifyalso that its portion of the project does not facilitate a prohibited businessrelocation, because this suggested additional requirement would be burdensomein this complex area of statutory interpretation. The applicant and projectdeveloper certifications should be sufficient since they constitute theprincipal participating parties in the proposed project. During the applicationreview, additional data, including certifications, may be required as thecircumstances warrant. Paragraph (c)(1)(ii) provides that the restriction against UDAG funds shallnot apply if the Secretary determines that the proposed relocation doesnot significantly and adversely affect the employment or economic baseof the area from which the facility is to be relocated and that the Secretaryis not required to make such a determination. Some respondents would preferto have the Secretary required to make the determination where a prohibitedrelocation is found to exist in either speculative space projects or projectswith identified intended occupants. The Department believes that Congressdid not intend to require the Secretary to make such a determination. Clearly,with reference to projects containing speculative space, the original provisionwas not amended and a similar provision (without a requirement for a determinationof no significant or adverse effect) was added in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)to apply the exception to the prohibition on funding a relocation of projectswith identified intended occupants. The Department has seen no evidencethat persuades it that Congress intended to change the practice of theSecretary not to make determinations that a relocation ``does not significantlyand adversely affect'' the area from which the relocation occurs. Thispractice has resulted in the broadest possible application of the prohibitionagainst funding business relocations from one area to another or from UDAGeligible jurisdictions in regard to proposed projects with identified intendedoccupants. One respondent identified an inequity in regard to the thresholds for applicationof the prohibition against funding UDAG projects containing speculativespace. An incongruity arises where the proposed facilities are sized justover the initial thresholds. The low cap caused small buildings with hugeamounts of speculative space to be favored over large buildings. The initialthresholds in paragraph (c)(1)(B)(iv) have been modified to correct theinequity.Section 570.456(c)(2) Applications for Projects With Identified IntendedOccupants Section 570.456(c)(2) concerns application of the business relocation prohibitionto projects with identified intended occupants. It implements section 516of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. It prohibits theUDAG funding of projects with identified intended occupants which are ``likelyto facilitate'' business relocations. Projects with speculative space which are ``intended to facilitate'' therelocation of a facility are not to be funded by UDAG, and under the 1987Act projects with identified intended occupants which are ``likely to facilitate''the relocation of any operation of a facility are not to be funded by UDAG.Under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of the regulation the term ``likely'' has beendefined to mean ``probably or reasonably to be expected as determined byfirm evidence * * *.'' The speculative space part of the rule does notcontain a definition of ``intended to facilitate''. Several commentersargued that the new provision in the 1987 Act which applies to projectswith identified intended occupants was adopted by Congress as a resultof a controversial project which, after the award and funding of most ofthe UDAG, presented a serious question of compliance with the statute.The new standard, commenters asserted, was intended to place a heavierburden on the applicant and the project developer to demonstrate that therewould not be a prohibited relocation. And, the argument continues, theproposed rule's definition of ``likely'' requires ``smoking gun'' evidence.The commenters read the definition to mean ``absolute proof'' that a relocationis actually happening. The Department believes that it would err in requiring anything less thanfirm evidence, since rumors of closings or reductions often abound whenno closing is planned, and even newspaper reports of proposed closingsmay be inaccurate. Firm evidence is not necessarily limited to informationfrom the project developer who must certify in the application for fundsthat the UDAG funds will not facilitate any business relocation or explainfully where UDAG funds will facilitate a business relocation. Nor doesthe definition require that a relocation is actually happening for theUDAG funding to be prohibited; such an interpretation is inconsistent with``probably or likely to be expected.'' Parties challenging the eligibilityof a proposed project certainly may rely on consultant studies, but itwould be impossible for the Department to consider such studies, by themselves,as ``firm evidence'' when both proponents and opponents have submittedsimilar studies drawing opposite conclusions. The Department intends toconsider all relevant evidence in determining whether a prohibited relocationis likely to be facilitated, but does not believe a change in the rule'sdefinition of ``likely'' is appropriate. An objection was made to the limitation that the prohibition applies onlyto moves from ``any UDAG eligible jurisdiction'' in paragraph (c)(2)(A),rather than from ``any area'' as in paragraph (c)(1) applications for speculativespace projects. It is argued that non-distressed cities can be adverselyaffected by businesses moving from their jurisdictions. Another respondentwould like to have this prohibition apply to moves from ``recent UDAG projects.''The choice of the locus is in the 1987 legislation, and the Departmentis bound by it. Paragraph (c)(2) also excludes relocations within a metropolitan area fromoperation of the prohibition against UDAG funding. This exclusion is consistentwith the practice of the Department over the entire history of the UDAGprogram and it has been applied to both proposed projects with identifiedintended occupants and speculative space projects as stated in paragraph570.456(c), from its inception. As noted in our discussion of speculativespace projects, there is no indication that Congress intended last yearto alter a ten year-old statutory policy.Commenters argued that using ``substantial'' in paragraph (c)(2)(B) tomodify ``reduction of any such operation'' and in paragraph (c)(5)(i) tomodify ``number of positions'' and ``employment opportunities'' in therule's definition of operation violated the intent of Congress in prohibitingUDAG funding of business relocations. This modifier, the commenters claimed,in effect places the ``no significant and adverse effect'' determinationsby the Secretary into the threshold issue of whether a prohibited relocationis present. The Department's purpose in adding ``substantial'' where indicatedabove is to avoid absurd results in applying the rule. If a project developeremploys 300 people and will move to a distressed city, causing its operationin the distressed city from which it is moving to be reduced by 10 people,the Department believes that Congress did not intend to prohibit use ofUDAG funds to assist in the relocation. The numbers posited in the exampleare more than<T3> de minimis</T3> but less than substantial under the circumstances.A substantiality test simply permits some weighing of the size of the reductionof the operation and the number of jobs lost and employment opportunitieslost against the jobs lost and relevant employment data in the affectedUDAG-eligible jurisdiction. Certainly in proposed projects where job lossor loss of employment is insubstantial, a distressed city should not bebarred from receiving UDAG funds, and the issue of weighing is appropriatelya threshold question. What constitutes substantial or insubstantial mustbe considered on an<T3> ad hoc</T3>, application-by-application basis. Congress has not, andthe Department, based on its experience in this complex area, should notset rigid, fixed standards or numbers in the intricate process of reviewingbusiness relocations and making threshold determinations. Use of the word``substantial'' is relevant in threshold determinations of whether a prohibitedrelocation would likely be facilitated, whereas the relevant measure forsubsequent findings is whether the relocation significantly and adverselyaffects the jurisdiction from which the operation or business is moving,which latter finding the Secretary is permitted to make as discussed inrelation to the similar provision in paragraph (c)(1)(ii). Where the 1987Act requires it, the Department has established in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) non-exclusive criteria to be used in making ``significant andadverse'' determinations. Another comment stated that the new provision giving assistance for individualsadversely affected by prohibited relocations, as set forth in paragraph(c)(4), requires that UDAG grants be conditioned on ``each identified occupantnot thereafter causing any relocation.'' Based on its experience, the Departmentprefers not to rely on covenants as a means of permitting a funding wherea prohibited relocation might occur; rather the goal is not to fund a prohibitedrelocation in the first instance by careful and complete analysis of theapplication and of the submissions of third parties. The same commenter suggested that a project developer name and keep currentits list of identified intended occupants up to the deadline for submittingfirm financing commitments. We believe that the certification requiredof the project developer in andSection; 570.458(c)(14)(iv) is continuingand where any business relocation is involved a detailed explanation wouldinclude identification of intended occupants_and more. Finally, the responses have indicated some confusion concerning whetherparagraph (c)(1) (projects with speculative space) or paragraph (c)(2)(projects with identified intended occupants) would be applied if an applicationcontains both categories and the speculative space thresholds are met.The typical regional shopping center with identified major department storesis an example of such a project. The Department would apply paragraph (c)(2)as to the identified occupant element and, because it would be necessaryto establish a presumption where the occupants are unknown, the Departmentalso would apply paragraph (c)(1) as to the speculative space portion ofthe proposed project.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Matters </ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Findingof No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7 a.m.and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of Rules Docket Clerk at the aboveaddress. This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 issued by the President February17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates that it does not (1) have an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) cause a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, Stateor local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) have a significantadverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or the ability of the United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601), the Undersigned certifiesthat this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities because the number of affected small entitieswould not be substantial. The funding for the UDAG program has been reducedin recent years and the changes will have no effect on the competitiveposition of small entities. <T3>Executive Order 12612, Federalism.</T3> The General Counsel, as theDesignated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,<T3> Federalism</T3>, has determined that the policies in this rule willnot have significant federalism implications when implemented and, thus,are not subject to review under the Order. The subject matter of the ruleis limited to matters of program administration associated with federalgrants, and has no preemptive effect on state law, nor does it restrainor interfere in any manner with state or local law or policy. <T3>Executive Order 12606, </T3><T3>the Family.</T3> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official underExecutive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this rule does nothave potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance, andgeneral well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order.The collection of information requirements contained in this rule havebeen submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980. Sections 570.456(c)(3) and 570.458(c)(14)(xviii)of this rule have been determined by the Department to contain collectionof information requirements.

(ii)(A) Any amount made available under this paragraph shall be used bythe grantee to assist individuals who were employed by the operation involvedbefore the relocation or reduction and whose employment or terms of employmentwere adversely affected by the relocation or reduction. The assistanceshall include job training, job retraining, and job placement. (B) If any amount made available to a grantee under this paragraph (c)(4)is more than is required to provide the assistance described in paragraph(c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section, the grantee shall use the excess amountto carry out community development activities eligible under section 105(a)of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.
