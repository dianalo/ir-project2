Background</ITAG><T3>FAC 84-53, Item III.</T3> This final rule provides simplified contractformats for use in acquisitions of supplies or services proposed to beacquired under firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic adjustmentcontracts. In conjunction with the simplified contract format, a new contractform, Standard Form 1447, Solicitation/Contract, is being issued.The rule also provides for the use of annual representations and certifications.<T3>FAC 84-53, Item V.</T3> This final rule is issued to make revisionsto the FAR procedures governing the use of individual sureties in supportof a bonding requirement. Among other things, the revisions would:1. Require individual sureties to pledge specific assets to support a bond.2. Identify and limit the types of assets which are acceptable for pledgebased upon a standard of identifiable value and ready marketability.3. Require objective evidence of asset ownership and unencumbered value.4. Require a Government security interest in the pledged assets by meansof a lien or real property or the establishment of an escrow account foracceptable personal property.5. Provide for the Governmentwide suspension or debarment of sureties whocommit serious improprieties.<T3>FAC 84-53, Item X.</T3> The clarification has been made to eliminatethe appearance that suspension of all progress payments is required evenif only a portion of an accounting system is deficient. The revision toFAR 32.503-6(b) states explicitly that the suspension of progress paymentsfor accounting deficiencies should be applied only to the portion of paymentsassociated with the deficiency.<T3>FAC 84-53, Item XI.</T3> FAR 36.602-3(c) required that discussionsbe held with at least three of the most highly qualified firms regardingconcepts and the relative utility of alternative methods of furnishingthe required services, when the prospective architect-engineer fees shallnot be considered in these discussions. This statement is not consistentwith Pub. L. 92-582, and therefore the FAR is revised to clarify this inconsistency.Federal agencies have expressed a need for increasing the short selectionprocess dollar threshold from the present $10,000 to $25,000. When thepresent threshold of $10,000 was established, the small purchase thresholdwas also $10,000. An increase in the short selection process dollar thresholdto $25,000 would facilitate an early award of A-E contracts that are withinthe small purchase limitation.FAR 52.236-20, Special Requirements, has been required for all cost-reimbursementconstruction contracts. The provisions of the clause were either unnecessary,or were duplicative of the provisions of the clause at 52.236-7, Permitsand Responsibilities, and the clause at 52.236-5, Material and Workmanship.Therefore, 52.236-20 is removed, and the applications of 52.236-7 and 52.236-5are expanded to permit their use for cost-reimbursement contracts.FAR 36.201(a) is revised to eliminate unnecessary requirements to evaluatecontractor performance and to prepare performance reports using the StandardForm 1420, Performance Evaluation (Construction Contracts).<T3>FAC 84-53, Item XVI.</T3> On June 5, 1985, the Defense AcquisitionRegulatory Council granted the Department of the Army authority to deviatefrom the provisions of FAR 47.305-16(b) and the clause at 52.247-60 tothe extent necessary to request additional information regarding shippingcharacteristics from offerors and to provide that offers submitted withoutshipping characteristics would be evaluated on the basis of the shippingcharacteristics submitted with any offer that produces the highest transportationcosts. The Army deviation has ensured that the contract administrationoffice receives the information in the contract necessary to establishthe liability of the successful offeror for any increased transportationcosts incurred by the Government as a result of misinformation furnishedby the offeror. This final rule extends the advantages of the Army deviationto all Government agencies and departments, and revises existing coverageto reflect the Government's intent that contract price reduction be onthe basis of actual costs incurred, not costs computed when the offer wasevaluated.<T3>FAC 84-53, Item XVII.</T3> This case was established as a result ofdifficulties experienced by DoD field activities which have automated systemsthat intermingle the full text clauses and provisions with those incorporatedby reference when generating solicitations and contracts. The FAR, as revisedin FAC 84-37, currently provides for the grouping of clauses and provisionsincorporated by reference.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG><T3>FAC 84-53, Items I, IV, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XV, XVI, andXVII.</T3> The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) does not applyto these final rules because each revision is not a significant revisionas defined in FAR 1.501-1; i.e., it does not alter the substantive meaningof any coverage in the FAR having a significant cost or administrativeimpact on contractors or offerors, or a significant effect beyond the internaloperating procedures of the issuing agencies.<T3>FAC 84-53, Items II, XIII, and XVIII.</T3> DoD, GSA, and NASA certifythat these final rules in FAC 84-53 will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) because_<T3>Item II.</T3> The extension of time for retention of records only appliesto a limited number of contractors, of which an even smaller number aresmall entities, which fail to meet the 90-day requirement for indirectcost rate submissions. The retention requirement being imposed for computerdata only affects those contractors who already maintain this type of datain their normal course of business. The burden of storing this additionaldata along with records already required to be obtained is minimal.<T3>Item XIII.</T3> This final rule does not affect the competitive postureof, or preference for small businesses, solicitation or small purchaseprocedures, impose nonreimbursed administrative costs, or required professionalskill requirements or business systems beyond those normally availablein-house to small businesses.<T3>Item XVIII.</T3> The revisions merely illustrate the nature of recordsGovernment personnel have access to and do not change existing requirements.Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply.<T3>FAC 84-53, Items III, V, and XIV.</T3> A Final Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis pertaining to the following items has been prepared for each itemin accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354)and each is on file in the FAR Secretariat and will be submitted to theChief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration_<ITAG tagnum="15">Item III_Contract Simplification Program </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Item V_Individual Sureties </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Item XIV_Special Tooling </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG><T3>FAC 84-53, Items I, III, IV, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XV,XVI, and XVII.</T3> The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) does notapply because these final rules do not impose any reporting or recordkeepingrequirements or collection of information from offerors, contractors, ormembers of the public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C.3501, et seq. <T3>FAC 84-53, Item II.</T3> This final rule will not impose any recordkeepingor information collection requirements from offerors, contractors, or membersof the public which require approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.The coverage has been revised to clarify that (1) computer data need notbe retained in its original form, provided the integrity of source datais maintained and an audit trail is established by the contractor; and(ii) only computer data that meets the definition of records as definedunder paragraph (a) of section 4.703(b)(3) and (d) need to be retained.OMB Control Number 9000-0034 has been approved under 44 U.S.C. 3501, etseq. <T3>FAC 84-53, Item V.</T3> Public comments concerning the informationcollection requirements under OMB Control Numbers 9000-0001 and 9000-0045and pertaining to the proposed rule were previously invited in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 29, 1988 (53 FR 48035). The PaperworkReduction Act (Public Law 96-511) applies because the final rule containsan information collection requirement. Accordingly, the information collectionrequirements are being submitted to OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. foran expedited review by OMB within 20 days of receipt. Public comments concerningthe revised information collection requirements should be submitted toOMB, Ms. Eyvette Flynn, FAR Desk Officer, Room 3235, NEOB, Washington,DC 20503. <T3>FAC 84-53, Item XIV.</T3> Public comments concerning the informationcollection requirements under OMB Control Number 9000-0075 and pertainingto the proposed rule were invited in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 27, 1988 (53 FR 37629) and the informationcollection requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) as required by 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. However, those estimates underestimatedthe usage requirement of DoD concerning special tooling. In addition, thisfinal rule consolidates the initial and updated listing requirements. Therefore,a revised Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis depicting a more realistic estimateof burden impact has been submitted to OMB for review. This identificationand use information is used by the contractor in performing its contractand then it is used by the Government buying offices and logistics officesto determine whether any of the special tooling can be used by the Governmentor contractors subsequent to its use during production by the acquiringcontractor. In addition, the information enables the Government to directretention or disposition of the special tooling following its use in majorsystems, components, and parts. The <T3>annual reporting burden</T3> for OMB Control Number 9000-0075 is estimatedas follows: Number of respondents, 10,000; responses per respondent, 2;annual responses, 20,000; preparation hours per response, 1; annual responseburden hours, 20,000. The <T3>annual recordkeeping burden</T3> is estimated as follows: Recordkeepers,10,000; annual hours per recordkeeper, 40; and total recordkeeping burdenhours, 400,000. Public comments concerning this request should be submittedto OMB, Ms. Eyvette Flynn, FAR Desk Officer, Room 3235, NEOB, Washington,DC 20503 by December 18, 1989. <T3>FAC 84-53, Item XVIII.</T3> This final rule does not change any recordkeepingor information collection requirements on offerors, contractors, or membersof the public which require approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.<ITAG tagnum="84">D.

As a result, the final rule makes the following changesfrom the coverage proposed: 1. The requirement in the proposed rule with respect to Miller Act bondsthat 100 percent of the individual surety's assets will be maintained forthe duration of the expected obligation of the surety has been modifiedto permit the contracting officer to release a portion of the individualsurety's assets based upon substantial performance of the obligations underthe contract. 2.
