Henri Namphy.   Some see an opening for democratic reforms under Haiti's newleader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who announced on nationwidetelevision Sunday that he was assuming the presidency ``to save thecountry from anarchy and chaos.''   But a Haitian government official said privately that Avril maybe thwarted by the military high command, which the official said``is not favorable to an opening toward the civilian sector andwants to maintain its privileges.''   Before the coup, Avril was the army's adjutant general.   Soldiers of the elite, 1,000-man Presidential Guard oustedNamphy and sent him to neighboring Dominican Republic early Sundayafter several hours of sporadic gunfire that apparently caused nocasualties. At least six people were reported killed, however, inwhat were described as reprisals against alleged Tonton Moucoutesthugs blamed for recent atrocities.   In justifying the coup, Sgt. Joseph Heubreux said thenoncommissioned officers who led it wanted to restore honor to thearmy and ``raise the prestige of the Haitian people degraded by somany acts which have revolted the conscience of the Haitian peopleand the world.''   It was Heubreux who appeared on television here to introduceAvril as the new president of this impoverished Caribbean islandnation.   Under Namphy, Haiti experienced increased random killings andintimidation of groups advocating democratic reform.   In the worst recent outrage, about 20 hoodlums brandishingmachetes, handguns and steel pikes burst into a Roman Catholicchurch during Mass on Sept. 11 and slaughtered 13 people.Seventy-seven others were wounded.   The toughs were identified as City Hall workers, and Namphy andPort-au-Prince Mayor Franck Romain were widely blamed for theattack.   Romain is thought to be a leader of a Macoutes faction. Hereportedly was arrested at the presidential palace shortly beforethe coup, then taken to the Dominican Embassy. He remained thereMonday, seeking political asylum and awaiting an exit visa.   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thechurch massacre was the apparent trigger for dissidentnoncomissioned officers who felt they were not getting proper payand recognition.   Avril had helped Namphy overthrow the 4-month-old civiliangovernment of President Leslie Manigat in a bloodless coup on June19.   The diplomat said of the dissident sergeants: ``Under Manigatthey felt slighted and snubbed. Under Namphy, they did not receivethe material signs of recognition they expected. And on top ofthat, the atrocity ... (Sept. 11) must have affected them asmen-of-the-people.''   Among 19 demands the Presidential Guard presented to themilitary high command on Sunday was a call for democracy, with freeelections.   It was uncertain whether the high command would agree to anydemocratic reforms.   Avril's pledge to take part in a dialogue with oppositionparties was generally welcomed, but popular politician SylvioClaude, the Christian Democratic Party leader, remained skeptical.   According to Claude, Avril ``is known as a Duvalierist, and allDuvalierists are criminals.''   Avril has been closely identified with the Duvalier regimessince the early 1960s, when he took part in the struggle againstanti-Duvalierist guerrillas. Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalierdestroyed the political power of the army in the 1960s with hisprivate militia of thugs, popularly known as Tonton Macoutes. Uponhis death his son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, succeeded himin 1971.   After the fall of Jean-Claude Duvalier in February 1986, Avrilwas briefly an adviser to the junta headed by Namphy. Avril wasdismissed in March 1986 after popular protest demonstrationsagainst him.   Larry Birns, director of the Washington-based Council ofHemispheric Affairs, said the key to the future course of Haitianpolitics lies with Col. Jean-Claude Paul, commander of the feared700-man Dessalines Barracks.   The military high command was said to be resisting efforts bythe Presidential Guard to elevate Paul to armed forces commander inchief.   Paul has been indicated on drug trafficking charges by a federalcourt in Florida. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said inWashington on Monday that making Paul army commander ``wouldcertainly give us an indication of the difficulties we will havewith this government if he is appointed.''   Birns said, ``Although skeptical that democracy is near inHaiti, I think it (the coup) is a hopeful sign. Namphy's rule haddegenerated into a highly eccentric and dangerous mode andsomething had to be done to get rid of him.''   ``Curiously enough, in recent weeks, Jean-Claude Paul ... hasestablished close working relations with some democratic figures inHaiti'' and soldiers from the Dessalines Barracks had been sent toguard Catholic churches recently.   ``Of course, all these people (jockeying for authoritarianpower) are thugs,'' Birns said. ``It's a question of relativity.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Michael Norton is based in Port-au-Prince ascorrespondent for The Associated Press and has lived in Haiti forthe past two years.</TEXT></DOC>
