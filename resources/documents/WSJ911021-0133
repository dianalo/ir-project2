Games available for personal computers &quot;tend to be verydeep, very realistic, with more adult-oriented themes,&quot; saysKelly Flock, director of development for Lucasfilm Games, aSan Rafael, Calif., unit of LucasArts Entertainment Co.Lucasfilm Games develops entertainment software for theeight-bit Nintendo Entertainment System, as well as forpersonal computers compatible with those made byInternational Business Machines Corp. Mr. Flock says gamesfor home video-game console systems, such as those made byNintendo Ltd., Sega Enterprises Ltd. and NEC Corp., have beenfundamentally different from those written for personalcomputers, mainly because of varying hardware capabilities.</LP><TEXT>   Personal computers have long offered the 16-bit computingpower now being incorporated into home video games. PCs alsohave large memory capacity, and their disk drives not onlyload information but save it as well -- a capability notavailable for most video games. This allows a player to stopa game, shut off the machine, and return later, picking upwhere the game left off.   But most personal computers also lack some of thespecialized features of videogame consoles, such as joystickcontrols and special sound-generating equipment. Thosefeatures are available for personal computers, but they canbe costly.   With the proper hardware in place, a personal computer canoffer access to a galaxy of high-tech entertainment programs.Consider, for example, Microsoft Corp.'s enduring favorite&quot;Flight Simulator&quot; program, available for both Apple ComputerInc.'s Macintosh and IBM PC-compatible computers. The premiseof Flight Simulator is essentially the same as for the 16-bitSuper Nintendo &quot;Pilotwings&quot; game. Players in both games flyand land an airplane. But Pilotwings allows a player to varyonly the direction and speed of the aircraft; FlightSimulator offers a control panel that emulates an aircraftcockpit. The couch-potato pilot can adjust flaps and checkcompass headings while cruising over a simulation of anactual city. (In a trip over the San Francisco Bay area, theGolden Gate Bridge is clearly visible.) Flight Simulator alsolets you pilot anything from a small propeller to a jumbojet. New airplane and scenery choices can be added bypurchasing an additional disk. That ability to update a gameis impossible to match on cartridge-based home videogameconsole systems.   Other computer games place you on the painless end of thescapel in simulated surgery (&quot;Life andamp; Death&quot; by SoftwareToolworks Inc., Novato, Calif.) or at the drawing board foran entire planet (&quot;SimEarth&quot; by Maxis of Orinda, Calif.). Thelatter is a global version of &quot;SimCity,&quot; which has beenavailable for computers and is being introduced for homevideo games on Nintendo's 16-bit machine. SimCity can also befound in compact-disk format.   For now, personal computers have an edge insophistication, but Lucasfilm Games' Mr. Flock sees thatcomputer-video game gap narrowing. &quot;We think they're growingtogether, and we think the video-game consoles are growingup,&quot; he says. At the same time, though, prices are alsoconverging. &quot;PC prices have dropped,&quot; Mr. Flock says, while&quot;the high-end video games have gone up.&quot;   One video guru, however, sees entertainment systems andpersonal computers filling very different niches. NolanBushnell, inventor of &quot;Pong&quot; and now a general manager in theinteractive consumer-products division of CommodoreInternational Ltd., says the uses for the machines remaindissimilar even as the machines themselves become more alike.   `One is designed to be watched from eight feet away, theother from 18 inches,&quot; Mr. Bushnell says. &quot;To do desk work,you really need a desk. To do entertainment, you really needto sit on a couch.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
