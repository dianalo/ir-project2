Trypsin treatment induced contraction and rounding of spreadcells. The results suggest that: (1) trypsin-induced cell contractionaffects the ability of cells to repair radiation damage, (2) spread cellsare better able to repair potential lethal damage (PLD) than roundedcells, (3) immediate plating survival of cells in high-density culturesmay not represent their intrinsic radiosensitivity and (4) cell-to-cellcontact is not necessary for log phase cells to repair PLD.</TEXT></DOC>
