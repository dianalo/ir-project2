It lent credence to earlier predictions by guerrilla leaders andforeign observers that an assault might occur in mid-May, followingthe spring thaw and the end last weekend of Ramadan, the Moslemholy month.   ``About 30,000 (guerrilla) forces will launch a common attack onKabul city very soon,'' the insurgents' Afghan News Agency quoted aguerrilla commander, Mohammad Nasir, as saying.   Neither the agency nor other guerrilla sources would specify thedate of the assault.   President Najib has insisted that his forces are strong enoughto withstand a guerrilla onslaught.   Kabul, a city of about 2 million inhabitants 110 miles west ofthe Pakistan border, is protected by at least three security ringsbuilt by Soviet forces, who for nine years intervened on thegovernment side.   Moscow continues to arm the Kabul government although the lastRed Army soldiers withdrew from Afghanistan on Feb. 15.   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized powerin a 1978 military coup, sparking the Moslem insurgency whose aimis to establish an Islamic republic.   The guerrillas, backed mainly by Pakistan and the United States,have tried since March to take the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabadwithout success.</TEXT></DOC>
