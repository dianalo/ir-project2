(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sponsors of a calendar that featuredphotos of young, single Dakotas farmers squandered profits onparties rather than keeping a promise to funnel money tofinancially strapped farmers, the state attorney general saidFriday.   A lawsuit filed in state district court accused the sponsors ofthe ``Dakota Men'' calendar of fraud. It seeks to stop sales of thecalendar's 1989 edition, freeze the assets of the sponsors'corporation and stop the corporation from claiming non-profitstatus, said Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth.   He said an audit of the sponsors organization turned up ``somevery questionable transactions.''   ``It is clear that a lot of this money went for elaborateparties, (at) which Dakota Men were present, (and) a lot of foodand liquor,'' Spaeth said at a news conference.   ``It is clear that, at best, this organization and itsprincipals never made any serious effort to fulfill any charitablepurposes,'' Spaeth said.   One of the defendants, Roger Jaeger, denied wrongdoing in atelephone interview Friday from the group's office in Fargo. Jaegeris former head of the sponsors' non-profit corporation, FOOD Inc.,or Farmers of Ongoing Determination.   ``We have been operating a good business,'' Jaeger said.   FOOD was started in 1986 to solicit charitable contributions toraise money to retrain displaced farmers, help them deal with thestress of tough times and make grants for such things as food andclothing, Spaeth said.   A letter printed on the cover of the 1989 calendar, which sellsfor $8.95, claims the corporation has ``returned money to farmrelief organizations helping farmers cope with the stress of theirbusiness and providing scholarships, job retraining, and immediatefood, clothing and shelter.''   But evidence indicates the calendar's sponsors personallyprofited by the sales, Spaeth said. He also alleged the sponsorsused a California company to skim off some of the profits.   The lawsuit seeks restitution for all ``misappropriated money,''which Spaeth said could total as much as $40,000.   Defendants in the lawsuit include FOOD and Lawrence Jaeger,Roger Jaeger, Perry Miller, Ruth Elbert and Karen Tyndall.   The Jaegers and Elbert are siblings, said Spaeth, who called thedefendants a ``very, very tight-knit group of people.''   For the year ending in April, FOOD earned $175,508 in totalrevenues, but no money was contributed to charity, Spaeth said.Since April, FOOD has given $2,000 to the North Dakota MentalHealth Association, Spaeth said.   Roger Jaeger said Friday his organization had made no othercontributions. ``That is getting at questions I can't answer atthis time. There is a reason.''   The calendars feature a farmer, from North or South Dakota eachmonth. Jaeger is ``Mr. February'' on the 1988 calendar. Theaccompanying copy beneath his photo says in part: ``Look deep intohis eyes, and you see a man who appreciates women, honesty,dependability and a good reputation.''   Evidence indicates that Tyndall set up her own company inCalifornia, KMGL, and arranged for FOOD to buy the Dakota Mencalendars from it, Spaeth said.   ``In reality, KMGL did nothing other than subcontract the workout to a California printing company,'' Spaeth said.   Tyndall billed FOOD for $60,226, while work done by the printingcompany cost $52,306, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
