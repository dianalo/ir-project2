Valeri Voskoboinikov, vice chairman of the Soviet Transport,Communication and Information Commission, and commission memberVladimir Yerohin were part of a delegation representingAviakompania Sverkhdalnikh Avialiniy, or ASDA.   The new company was formed last summer to explore creation of anew, long-range Soviet airline to be run independent of thegovernment and compete with government-owned Aeroflot.   The delegation has been gathering information about possibleacquisitions of Boeing jetliners.   The idea for ASDA, said Voskoboinikov, came from Aeroflot pilotsand aircraft engineers tired of the carrier's bureaucracy.   ``In this situation, Aeroflot is the only airline in the SovietUnion,'' he said. ``It cannot provide good service for the Sovietcitizens and cannot provide satisfactory management.''   This year alone there were 20 million potential passengers whocouldn't be served by Aeroflot, Yerohin said, noting that was theofficial figure and ``the real number is probably higher.''   In addition to being the non-communist world's largest maker ofjetliners, Boeing in the past 40 years has produced some of thiscountry's deadliest weapons for use against the Soviets, includingthe B-52 bomber and Minuteman and air-launched cruise missiles.   Boeing already sells jets to China, Poland and other communistnations.   Aeroflot, the world's largest airline, already has orderedAirbus Industrie A-310 jets and has talked with Boeing andMcDonnell Douglas Corp. about possible commercial jet purchases.   Voskoboinikov, 34, from Northwest Siberia, is a helicopter pilotand aeronautical engineer. Yerohin, also 34 and an aircraftengineer, is from Gorky. Neither is a member of the Communist Party.   Neither they nor Boeing would say much about their talks,including how many planes ASDA might want or what type. Nor wouldthey say much about the airline's financial arrangements.   Much of that hasn't been decided, Voskoboinikov said, includingwhether the new carrier might have some Western investment or be ajoint venture with a foreign airline. The goal is to have anairline ``totally independent financially'' of the Sovietgovernment.   He and Yerohin stressed the delegation came to the United Statesonly to gather information to study later. They said it was invitedby Boeing and did not plan to visit McDonnell Douglas on this trip.   ASDA officials previously have said they were interested in 25Boeing 747-400s, but neither of the two Soviet deputies would sayhow many of those long-range jumbo jets or other planes ASDA mightwant to buy or lease.   A 747-400 costs $125 million or more and Boeing is booked solidwith orders through the mid-1990s. ASDA hopes to start up by late1991.   ``Right now, negotiations are in process and we cannot reallytell you what the plans and operations are,'' he said. ``But I cantell you the atmosphere of the negotiations is good.''   The Soviet aerospace industry produces a wide variety ofpassenger and cargo jets and both Voskoboinikov and Yerohin saidthey are about the same as Boeing planes in reliability. But theycan't match the levels of comfort in Western aircraft, and Boeingplanes are far more economical to run, Vokoboinikov said.   He also says Soviet planebuilders won't like the competition.   ``They will not be happy about it. But at the same time, theywill realize they should improve their service,'' Vokoboinikovsaid. ``Ultimately, the usage of new foreign airplanes will causeimprovement of the domestic industry, which will be good for it.''   Routes and destinations haven't been decided, but Voskobionikovsaid they want to fly ``to practically all parts of the world''with both passenger and cargo service.   Aeroflot flies an estimated 8,100 aircraft to more than 3,700destinations. ASDA won't be able to replace that, Voskobionikovsaid, but there is a market.   ``There probably will be clientele for both airlines. ... Andour passengers are not used to good service, like they are here,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
