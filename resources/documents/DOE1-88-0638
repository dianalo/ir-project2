These theories are then tested to see how accuratethey are in explaining arms transfers. The method used for this testingis to create analytic measures for each theory and then to compare actualdata on arms transfers with the assumptions and predictions of each theory.Results of this study indicate that none of the economic or politicaltheories on American arms transfers provide a sufficient explanationfor the developments in arms transfers since World War II. To explainarms transfers in the face of the failure of commonly accepted theories,an alternative view is suggested. This alternative theory argues thatarms transfers must be viewed in the light of a broad understanding ofthe evolution of American foreign policy and political ideology sinceWorld War II. In support of this theory the history of the arms tradeand the relationship between the arms trade and American foreign policyare examined.</TEXT></DOC>
