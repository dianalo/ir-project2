Justice must decide whether to sign up forchange now or wait until the Supreme Court makes good on itswarning that absent reform, the Justices might completelyrepeal this statute.   For the sixth time in as many years, there is a proposalin Congress to end the most absurd RICO cases. Along withcouples suing each other as racketeers in divorces, among the1,000 or so cases filed in the past year are companies suingeach other as racketeers for claims they made in pet-foodadvertisements and a California lawyer who sued the city ofHuntington Beach as a criminal enterprise for giving himthree speeding tickets. Scores of such cases are lured by thepromise of triple damages and the opportunity to slander theother side with &quot;racketeer.&quot;   The good news is that the RICO reform bill cleared a HouseJudiciary subcommittee earlier this month on a bipartisanvoice vote. The main lobbying group against reform isCongress Watch, one of the satellites in Ralph Nader'spro-litigation galaxy.   The bill is limited to restricting civil RICO cases fordamages -- which account for more than 90% of RICO cases, notthe remaining small share of criminal cases where prosecutorsbring racketeering charges. Still, the idea is to set up ajudicial-gatekeeper system so that only real criminalactivity could lead to RICO lawsuits for damages.   A federal judge trying such a case would be required todismiss the lawsuit unless the defendant had already beenconvicted of a racketeering offense in a criminal trial orthe judge could determine that RICO was justified because itwas clear there were &quot;egregious&quot; crimes. Plaintiffs could nolonger RICO defendants into protracted discovery proceedingsunless the judge agreed. The burden of proof that theplaintiff would have to meet would be raised to thequasi-criminal test of &quot;clear and convincing evidence.&quot; Thebill would also completely exempt the exercise of free speechfrom these suits, which would have protected the RICO-edanti-abortion demonstrators.   These amendments are hardly perfect, but they areprogress. Nonetheless, an official from the criminal divisionof Justice told Congress that while the department could&quot;generally&quot; and &quot;at least in principle&quot; agree to limits onRICO suits between private parties, it absolutely opposed anylimits on any cases Justice itself might want to bring. Thedepartment even wants to be able to bring RICO cases fordamages that come under the free-speech exception.   The most brazen part of the testimony was the claim thatJustice already behaves because it is bound by its guidelineson when federal prosecutors can bring RICO cases. This is alaugh, insofar as Justice has routinely violated itsguidelines. Former prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani got Justice'spermission to RICO Marc Rich and Princeton/Newport for whatwere essentially tax cases, and he threatened to RICO DrexelBurnham Lambert into bankruptcy before trial. Publicity aboutthese abuses led to amendments of the guidelines, but there'sno guarantee that prosecutors will comply with the amendmentsif a target is politically vulnerable.   The guidelines themselves implicitly admit that RICO is arubber hose, which the Justice Department has to take painsto avoid abusing. &quot;The department's judicious and restraineduse of the RICO,&quot; the guidelines say, &quot;has been a significantfactor in fending off attacks by groups who might like to seethe statute's provisions sharply diluted.&quot;   A chief sponsor of the bill, Democratic Rep. WilliamHughes, recalls that he recently ran into Chief JusticeWilliam Rehnquist, who said he was delighted that Congresswas finally serious about reforming the law. This might alsobe a hint of what might happen if reform fails yet again.   As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the last time the SupremeCourt heard a RICO case, it's unlikely the statute couldsurvive a broad constitutional challenge because its vaguelanguage is as comprehensible as saying, &quot;Life is afountain.&quot; Unless Congress and the Justice Department canreform RICO, the Justices should repeal it.</TEXT></DOC>
