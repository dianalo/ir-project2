DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials of the Bush and Carteradministration say the furor over last weekend's elections inPanama may bode well for prospects that Nicaragua's Sandinistagovernment will conduct fair balloting next year.   ``I am prepared to accept the Nicaraguan government's intentiontoday to carry out an honestly counted election,'' Francis MacNeil,who was President Carter's ambassador to Costa Rica, told theCommission on Free and Fair Elections in Nicaragua.   ``Certainly they have before them the example of Gen. Noriega,who has demonstrated how not to steal elections,'' MacNeil saidThursday in the final round of three days of hearings by theprivately financed, conservative-backed bipartisan commission.   His testimony came as President Bush urged allied nations tojoin in condemning Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's militaryleader, for election fraud in Sunday's balloting, in which Noriegahas claimed victory.   On Wednesday, Peter Rodman, special assistant to the presidentfor national security affairs, told the commission, ``I think theSandinistas may well have been watching what happened in Panama.''He added, ``the Sandinistas are smarter than Noriega.''   But Keith E. Schuette, president of the National RepublicanInstitute for International Affairs, said his group found``disturbing parallels, too frequent to be considered accidental,''in the election laws, government organization and opposition inNicaragua and Panama.   ``Sufficient freedom of organization, expression and activitydoes not currently exist to ensure a free and fair election'' inNicaragua, Schuette said Thursday.   Luigi Einaudi, director of policy planning for the StateDepartment's Bureau of Inter-American affairs andambassador-designate to the Organization of American States, agreedthe nature of the Nicaraguan government ``raises major questionsabout the ability to in fact carry out a free and impartialelection.''   However, Einaudi said, ``These need not be insurmountableobstacles.'' He expressed ``cautious optimism that the game is notautomatically over and that it may in fact be possible to move thepolitical conflict in Nicaragua to the political ground and awayfrom the military.''   The Nicaraguan elections are to be held in February 1990 underan agreement Managua made with the governments of Costa Rica, ElSalvador, Guatemala and Honduras.</TEXT></DOC>
