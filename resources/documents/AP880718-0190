The servicemen were among a group of nine off-duty soldiers whowere attacked early Sunday as they left a discotheque in San PedroSula, about 125 miles northwest of the capital of Tegucigalpa, aHonduran police report said.   Three gunmen hurled a grenade and fired M-16 rifles on the groupfrom a car, the report said.   No one claimed responsibility for the attack.   In Washington, the Pentagon identified five of the wounded as:Elbert Whitehead, an Army specialist from Enfield, N.C.; JamesJones, Army specialist, of Ebensburg, Pa.; Air Force Staff Sgt.Shawn Cunningham, of Cheshire, Conn.; and Air Force Sgt. MichaelShea of Gardena, Calif. and Army specialist John Monroe of SpringLake, Mo.   Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood said the name of the sixthperson injured was not released pending notification of family.   Earlier reports said four men were wounded, but doctors atPalmerola said another man was hit by shapnnel and a sixth injuredan ankle.   A U.S. military spokesman in Honduras, Air Force Capt. PatEnglehart, said the five servicemen were hospitalized and were``doing very well'' late Monday. She said a sixth needed nohospital treatment. She did not elaborate.   The injured men were among 150 servicemen on a one-dayrecreation leave from Palmerola Air Force Base. Following theincident, all were recalled to the air base as a precaution, Woodsaid.   The soldiers, on leave from Palmerola, 41 miles northeast ofTegucigalpa, wore civilian clothes and carried no weapons whenattacked, according to U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles Barclay.   ``Palmerola is not in a state of alert. Only its securitymeasures have been increased in the past 30 hours,'' Barclay said.   Embassy officials would not elaborate on what steps had beentaken at the Palmerola, which is the headquarters for U.S. militaryoperations in Honduras.   After the attack, the servicemen fled in a rented van, withthree of the van's wheels damaged by bullets, according to thepolice report.   ``They went toward the northern part of the city but had to parkat a milk products factory because the driver was hurt,'' it said.The assailants pursued them and remained at the factory about fiveminutes, then fled, according to the report.   A night watchman, identified as Jose Maria Perez, hid theservicemen in the guardhouse at the entrance to the plant,according to newspaper accounts. He then called police and the RedCross.   Embassy spokeswoman Anne Sigmund would not confirm the detailsof the police report. She and Barclay said only that an explosivedevice and small weapons were used in the attack.   The Pentagon said there were 10 or 12 attackers.   The attack was one of the most serious since tension beganbuilding this year over the U.S. military presence in the CentralAmerican country, which is also has been used as a base byU.S.-supported rebels fighting the government of Nicaragua.   The United States has maintained troops in Honduras since theleftist Sandinistas seized power in neighboring Nicaragua in 1979.   About 1,100 U.S. troops are stationed at Palmerola and othersvisit for training exercises, military construction work and otherprojects.   At least 30 American soldiers in Honduras have been killed orwounded in accidents or incidents of violence since the UnitedStates began joint military maneuvers with the Honduran military in1982.   Anti-American protests broke out in April following thedeportation to the United States of Juan Ramon Matta, who waswanted in the United States on drug trafficking charges and forquestioning in the 1986 slaying in Mexico of U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration agent Enrique Camarena.   The Honduran Constitution forbids the deportation of Hondurannationals.   Demonstrators burned the U.S. Consulate and U.S. InformationService office in the capital to protest Matta's deportation andthe U.S. military presence in Honduras. The violence prompted thegovernment to temporarily impose a state of emergency restrictingcivil liberties.</TEXT></DOC>
