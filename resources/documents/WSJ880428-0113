A sluggish mortgage market has many lenders marketing speedy approval. These instruments &quot;are really on the rise,&quot; says Richard Plume of Bayporte Financial andamp; Investments Inc., a Foster City, Calif., originator and repackager of loans. &quot;At least 50% to 80% of the lenders we do business with have them in some form.&quot;    With a 25% down payment, for example, First Wachovia Corp., Winston-Salem, N.C., reduces the documentation needed to verify employment and credit history. That can cut the loan-approval process to as little as four days from more than a month. In California, Glendale Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association promises an unconditional answer in five days and funding in 20 days. Others &quot;prequalify&quot; customers, helping them figure out how big a loan they can handle. BayBanks Mortgage Corp., Boston, says its six-month-old program is prompted by a &quot;very, very competitive&quot; lending environment.    But one Atlanta banker says all mortgages are quick these days since &quot;lenders aren't bogged down with loans.&quot;    THE POWER SHOWER reigns for socially conscious parents-to-be.    The old-fashioned baby shower takes on new glitz, with more affairs both coed and catered. &quot;This is the age of entertaining,&quot; explains Marcy Blum, a New York party planner. At Catering by Joyce, Miami, a baby shower costs as much as $10,000 and features a 60-pound watermelon carved into a baby carriage, holding a baby made of apples, oranges, cantaloupe and honeydew. Ben Giovanni Bolla, a Beverly Hills caterer, organized one shower where guests were picked up by limousine and waiters wore Louis XIV garb.    Baby registries, taking after bridal registries, also are booming. At the Wicker Garden, New York, guests spend an average of &quot;easily $100&quot; for gifts such as custom-designed lamps and rocking geese. La Canastilla Cubana, a Hialeah, Fla., store that caters to Cuban-Americans, says its baby registry is so popular that &quot;even Americans are coming in to register now.&quot; Some 400 expectant moms are currently registered.    SALES TACTICS take on a new look as corporations rethink strategy.    With the cost of a sales call now as high as $2,000 and rising 15% a year, companies are revamping sales operations to boost productivity. A sales person no longer can pitch just a product but &quot;must understand the profit economics of the buyer,&quot; says William O'Connell of Personnel Corp. of America, Norwalk, Conn. Many adopt a multi-tiered approach, tightening relations with major accounts but using cheaper methods such as direct mail for lesser prospects.    One steel company has a metallurgist on the shop floor of a Detroit auto maker to help develop the best steel for its stamping process, says Stephen Doyle, a Great Neck, N.Y., consultant. Citing a &quot;dramatic shift in the way things are sold,&quot; Bahlsen Inc., a Raleigh, N.C., baked-goods maker, adopts an &quot;eclectic&quot; approach to replace its old two-method system -- brokers and direct sales. Next, says Mr. Doyle, sales forces will begin acting as consultants, helping to mesh their products with clients' goals.    Recognizing the change, Hewlett-Packard Co. markets computer systems to help manage the complex data of the new sales environment.    OVERBOOKED SOCIALITES now can check the dates of coming galas through the Moet Social Chronicle, a telephone service that provides a master social calendar for New York City. The idea: to prevent scheduling conflicts.    YELLOW-PAGE LISTINGS, an indicator of business start-ups and failures, show that the number of tanning salons zoomed in 1987, with listings up 55.3% to 17,405, says Yellow Page Research Group. Solar-energy equipment wholesalers had the greatest decline in listings, down 47.9% to 2,808.    MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS are the &quot;hot&quot; area of investment banking, say 29% of senior corporate finance professionals surveyed by Albert Frank-Guenther Law Inc., a New York public-relations firm. But stock issues and initial public offerings are ho-hum; only 4% call them &quot;hot.&quot;    MORE BUSINESS CLUBS see humanism as the bottom line.    A small network of alternative business clubs that focus on values and fulfillment is growing. Renaissance Business Associates, a five-year-old organization based in Loveland, Colo., now boasts 23 groups in the U.S. &quot;This is the most we've ever had, and it is steadily growing,&quot; says Elaine Gagne, executive director. In the Boston area, James Ritscher, founder of Organization Transformation Network, considers going national. &quot;People are looking for something,&quot; he says. &quot;These groups fulfill that need.&quot;    Typically, the groups discuss how to bring personal and humanistic values into business. Often they are loose groupings that lack a hierarchy and reshape according to the needs of their members. &quot;If you are looking for a high-spirited replacement for the Rotary Club, I don't think it has come into existence,&quot; says Harrison Owen, a Potomac, Md., consultant.    Betsy Combier of the Business Initiative, New York, says growth is limited by the busy schedules of its members.    BRIEFS: The auction house Sotheby's Holdings Inc. says it will be listed on the American Stock Exchange with the symbol BID. . . . In Chicago, Columbia College conducts a forum on the future of live audiences dubbed &quot;The Couch Potato Challenge.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
