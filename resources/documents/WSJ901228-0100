Butthe assumption would be wrong.   As big old banks wring their hands and slash dividends,scores of small new banks are opening their doors. Withcredit tightening, these institutions and other small banksare attracting family-owned businesses hungry for cash andpersonal service.</LP><TEXT>   In Pennsylvania, 28 banks have opened since 1987, comparedwith just six banks in the prior 20 years, state bankingregulators say. Bank formations also have been increasing inFlorida, Georgia, Texas, California and New Jersey.Nationally, new bank charters have ranged between 200 and 300a year for the last six years.   &quot;Mergers of small banks into large banks tend to lead toan increase in the number of small-bank charters,&quot; saysfinancial analyst Ken E. Walsh of the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. Some managers deposed in the mergers, headds, are eager to start their own banks in their familiar,local market.   Nascent banks have some obvious advantages. They aren'tstrapped by unwise loans made in real estate, Third Worlddebt or leveraged buy-outs, as many big banks are.   Still, small banks face their own obstacles, ranging fromstate lending ceilings to the inconvenience of singlelocations. But Don J. Kauth, a bank analyst with First AlbanyCorp. in Albany, N.Y., says the industry shakeout favorscommunity-oriented banks along with the efficient giants.   Alan Armstrong, owner of Tiffany Dining Palace andamp; Gazebo inCentre City, Pa., has discovered the pluses and minuses ofdealing with a smaller bank, Madison Bank of Blue Bell, whichhas $28 million in assets.   For Mr. Armstrong, Pennsylvania's lending limit of 15% ofa bank's capital for any one customer is a drawback indealing with a small bank. It means a second bank mustparticipate in larger loans, requiring twice the paper workand personnel. &quot;It's more complex, like having two bosses,&quot;he says.   Yet, in a tight credit market, it helped that the localbanker knew his 20-year business history, he adds. &quot;I couldget loans at Madison when I couldn't get loans at otherplaces,&quot; he says.   Another entrepreneur, Pat T. Deon Sr., just moved somecompany accounts to Madison Bank from First PennsylvaniaBank, which had $5.2 billion in assets before being acquiredrecently by CoreStates Bank NA.   &quot;Every time you do business with {Madison}, you don't haveto go through the torture test,&quot; says Mr. Deon, whose familyruns a commercial-development company in Fairless Hills, Pa.He says he not only gets next-day notice on loan approvals,but also runs ideas by Madison's president, Vito DeLisi, whoknows the local market and is easy to &quot;get on the phone.&quot;Such access is hard to come by in the big banks.   Jim Hoffman, 61 years old, is a refugee from just such abank. When he left his post as senior vice president ofMeridian Bank, which has $10.1 billion in assets, Mr. Hoffmanwas tired of the &quot;bureaucracy of corporate giants.&quot; Whensmall-business owners in his community of Media, Pa.,approached him about starting a local bank, Mr. Hoffman choseto return to his &quot;roots in country banking.&quot;   With a group of seven co-founders, Mr. Hoffman raised $4million in six months in 1988. Security First Bank, now twoyears old, has assets of about $37.1 million and has beenprofitable in the past four quarters. It offers loans assmall as $1,000, a sum that doesn't excite most big banks.   At big banks, &quot;the lines are longer and there is nofamiliar face to take care of Henry or Sarah,&quot; Mr. Hoffmansays. &quot;There are those who love the bank machines, and thosewho prefer personal service.&quot;   Anna and Carl Galantino are just the types Mr. Hoffman hasin mind. The Galantinos have run a building-supply companyfor 50 years, doing business for most of that time withMellon Bank, which has $29.4 billion in assets. But theyrecently moved their company's accounts to nearby SecurityFirst. &quot;We got fed up with Mellon,&quot; says Mrs. Galantino. &quot;Itgot too big to pay any attention to us. We decided to takeour business someplace else. And to this day, not a soul fromMellon has asked why.&quot;   A Mellon spokeswoman responds: &quot;We're always unhappy tolose a customer. It tells us we have to keep trying harder.&quot;   Several of the new start-ups have targeted business peopleand other borrowers in ethnic communities. In Philadelphia'sChinatown, First Commercial Bank of Philadelphia recentlyheld its first anniversary gala. Teller windows became amakeshift bar, and the cocktail chatter was mostly inCantonese, Mandarin or Vietnamese. First Commercial targetsAsian customers, as well as food purveyors at nearby streetkiosks and farmers' markets.   &quot;We have an advantage over competitors in that we speakthe language of our customers,&quot; says Chairwoman Julie Wong,whose bilingual agents translate documents for clients.   First Commercial's customized service approach also hasdrawn interest outside the Asian-American community. RaymondWyszynski, president of Wyszynski Provision, meat packers,appreciates the caliber of loan officers at First Commercial,where he is negotiating a loan.   His company has several accounts at CoreStates FinancialCorp., which has $23.3 billion in assets, but Mr. Wyszynskisays: &quot;Our contact only has a limited amount of authority.I've seen an influx of younger kids being groomed for higherpositions. I'm irritated by personal things -- a young loanofficer who probably can't manage his personal savings havinga say in my business.&quot;   Spokesmen for Mellon and CoreStates say they welcomecompetition, and argue they aren't losing many customers toniche banks, especially when it comes to lending. Largebanks, they say, offer more services, locations andtechnological support.   Smaller banks do face obstacles. They tend to confinelending to one geographic area and are vulnerable to swingsin the local economy. Community banks should be especiallycareful to diversify by borrower, industry and type of loan,says First Albany's Mr. Kauth.   The personal touch can inspire faith even in investors,which is especially important because of the unorthodoxmethods some bank entrepreneurs use to get started. EffieHolloman, a retiree who lives on $12,000 a year, recentlysigned on as an investor in United Bank of Philadelphia witha check for $1,000. She was just one investor tapped byUnited Bank Chairwoman Emma Chappell at a gathering at thePrayer Chapel God in Christ in northwest Philadelphia.   If United Bank, which has acquired about $3.5 million incapital, can raise $1.5 million more, it will get a fullcharter from the state and become the first black-controlledbank here since 1956, designed to &quot;empower&quot; minoritybusinesses as well as wean clients away from check-cashingagencies, says Mrs. Chappell.   Mrs. Holloman thinks that's a worthy cause. &quot;I think weneed an Afro-American bank in this city, and I haveconfidence in God that it will survive.&quot;   ---                    New Bank Charters                                                                                                                 The nine states with the most activity*                                                                                                          Florida                             107   Georgia                              78   Texas                                45   California                           44   New Jersey                           32   Colorado                             29   Pennsylvania                         28   Illinois                             25   Connecticut                          24                                                                                                          *Since Jan. 1, 1987   Source: Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
