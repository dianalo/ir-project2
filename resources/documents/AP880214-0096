The Market Center, a 150-acre complex of wholesale showroomscontained in eight buildings, typically draws 500,000 buyers ayear. The center handles about $6.5 billion worth of wholesaleorders annually.   Last year, the number of buyers was down, but the number ofstores represented was up.   ``We look at two things when we're talking about the number ofbuyers: quality and quantity,'' said Michael Parks, president ofthe center's Hardgoods Division, which includes furniture, floorcovering, lighting, jewelry and bath-bed-linen industries.   ``In 1987, we had the healthiest year we've had in four years(in the Hardgoods Division). We held our own in the Southwest. Ourgrowth came out of the other regions of the country. We have done alot of marketing to those other regions.''   Buyer attendance dropped 9.1 percent last year in the Softgoodsdivision, which includes men's, women's and children's apparel andrelated merchandise. However, the number of stores represented, acrucial denominator, increased 11 percent, said division presidentDonna Knox.   ``Fortunately, a number of years ago, we redefined our strategyon attracting retailers to Dallas,'' said Lucy Crow Billingsley,chief executive officer of the Dallas Market Center.   ``Not only do we want to be what we've always been _ the bestspecialty store market in the country _ but we also want to expandgeographically and reach much further than the 10-state area nextto us. And we've done that.''   Independent chains and small, home-owned retailers have been thetraditional base of the Dallas Market Center's buyers. Byimplementing a new retail buyer development program, complete withtravel incentives, retailers outside the Southwest and largedepartment-store chains have become more aware of the Dallas MarketCenter.   In the soft goods area, center workers compiled a list ofretailers that do more than $1 million in annual sales but don'tcome to Dallas to buy. That list had more than 12,000 stores.</TEXT></DOC>
