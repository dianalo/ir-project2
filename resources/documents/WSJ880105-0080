Kinnicutt (WSJ Special) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> TNM PUB </IN><DATELINE> MILAN, Italy  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Arnoldo Mondadori was only 18 years old when he began printing a socialist weekly 80 years ago. Today, the company that bears his name, Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A., is one of Italy's largest publishing houses, printing everything from literary classics to comics.    Mondadori's two dozen magazines include the flagship Panorama, Italy's biggest newsweekly. Half the newspaper La Repubblica, Italy's largest daily, is owned by Mondadori. The company claims 24% of Italy's market for non-children's books, more than double its closest rival.    Mr. Mandadori died in 1971. But while the company remains in the hands of his heirs, a battle for control may be brewing after the sudden death in March of Mondadori's president. Italy's leading financier, Carlo De Benedetti, has built up a 20.9% direct holding --the largest single stake --in Mondadori, and increased his stake in the Mondadori family holding company, spurring speculation that he will add the publishing company to his empire. Complicating the plot is media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, another Mondadori shareholder.    Moreover, a surge in newspaper and magazine sales in Italy --accompanied by hefty advertising revenues --makes purveyors of the printed word increasingly attractive acquisition targets. And Mondadori, with market capitalization of about one trillion lire ($864 million), may be undervalued, analysts say, making it ripe for a raid. Mondadori shares have traded recently at about 17,850 lire ($15.43).    In 1986, Mondadori's group net income tripled to 75.2 billion lire ($65 million) from 1985, while sales rose 9%, to 1.125 trillion lire. The company projects further gains for 1987. Its prosperity marks a turnaround, following a costly foray into television in the early 1980s.    But Mondadori has been shaken by the death last spring of Mario Formenton, husband of Arnoldo Mondadori's daughter Cristina and a powerful president. He concentrated the 50.3% of Mondadori shares held by Arnoldo's descendants in a holding company, Ame Finanziaria S.p.A., or Amef. Under a pact that expires in 1990, the Formenton family and its backers, mainly Mr. De Benedetti, control around 44% of Amef.    In a move by Mr. De Benedetti to bolster his interest in the publishing house, a holding company he controls raised its stake in Amef last month to 25% from 18.9%. Mr. De Benedetti has denied any takeover designs. But he reportedly has sided with Mrs. Formenton in an apparent feud with her nephew Leonardo --the founder's grandson and company vice president. Leonardo Mondadori and his allies, notably Mr. Berlusconi, control roughly 36% of Amef stock, and Mr. Berlusconi has said he would contest any De Benedetti bid for control. The remaining 20% of Amef began trading on the Milan Stock Exchange in September.    Mr. Mondadori, 41 years old, plays down the power struggle, describing the corporate mood as &quot;tranquil.&quot; Mr. De Benedetti &quot;will use a hammer only if some other shareholder becomes too important,&quot; Mr. Mondadori predicts.    Instead, he prefers to focus on Mondadori's plans for growth. Mondadori is seeking a partner &quot;in English-or Spanish-speaking countries,&quot; he says, as well as eyeing Italy's many small, specialized publishing houses.    He is determined to boost profits in the book division he has headed since 1985. Despite a degree in philosophy and his scholarly mien, he has shifted Mondadori's somewhat musty image toward the mass market by recruiting authors, launching big promotions and opening U.S.-style bookmarts.    He also helped bring to Italy the Canadian-owned Harlequin series of romance novels, which have sold 900 million copies here since 1981. Last summer, Mondadori created a minor publishing sensation with &quot;Libidine,&quot; the world's first inflatable book, featuring a female torso with an air-valve navel on the cover and sex jokes inside. &quot;The idea was to catch the attention of young readers and bring them into bookstores,&quot; says Mr. Mondadori. </TEXT></DOC>
