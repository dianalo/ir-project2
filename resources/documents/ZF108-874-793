 Here are our findings.andM;The first obvious improvement is in the installation routine.andP;  With earlierversions, it was necessary to run batch (CMD) files from the installed OS/2to get Communications Manager and the two components of Database Manager onto your hard disk.andM;Now, there's a single routine which gives you the choice of either installingor removing the three components of Database Manager, Communications Managerand the LAN Requester -- all from one menu.andM;You either come to this menu automatically at the end of the installation ofthe base operating system, or you can get to it at any time by typing acommand at the main OS/2 prompt.andP;  The menu also offers you an alternativeoption whereby you can complete the routine by means of a custom installdisk.andP;  This would be used in a department if an administrator wished to setup a common configuration for several PCs.andP;  If you select this option, allyou're asked for is the workstation name, and the rest of the choices aretaken care of by the custom disk.andM;IBM has also been listening to users.andP;  You're now given a choice of whichdrive you want to install any component on.andP;  That was possible in earlierversions and you could, for example, move Database Manager from drive C to D,but you needed to change a few lines in a couple of batch files and inCONFIG,SYS.andP;  All this is now done for you.andM;Perhaps the most important improvement in the overall installation comes withCommunications Manager.andP;  As I've argued before, good communications ought tobe transparent and once you've gone through the configuration routine, youshould be able to forget about them.andM;In Communications Manager itself, the main configuration options provide youwith just about every parameter you might need to change for a particularcommunications system.andP;  Those screens can be pretty daunting unless youreally know what you're doing.andP;  (My eyes glazed over a couple of years ago,when I was just trying to set up a modem to link in with a bulletin board.)andM;A new configuration system is now included called Basic ConfigurationServices (BCS) -- this can also be accessed either during the installation orat any time through one command.andM;It asks you if you want to change or create a configuration file for eitheryour own workstation, or another.andP;  It then takes you on to the service forwhich you want to configure, giving a choice of five: 3270 and ASCII terminalemulations, the new 5250 and Remote Data Services, and the LAN.andM;You then get a simple screen of choices for the parameters of the serviceconcerned.andP;  For example, to set up my modem now, there are just five fieldsthat I have to get right (port number, baud rate and so on) before I get achoice of eight supported modems.andP;  And that's it.andM;Some of the other services require a bit more information than that, but theemphasis in BCS is on simplicity.andP;  One of five configuration options is forRemote Data Services (RDS).andP;  This is the facility that allows the DatabaseManager on one PC to access databases stored under its control on another.andM;In previous releases of Extended Edition, you could store the data files of adatabase on a network server from Extended Edition running on a workstation,but only by using the normal file share network facilities.andM;This would cause an excessive amount of traffic to travel down the wires andreduce performance.andP;  With RDS, only the SQL requests are sent to the serverand only the requested data is sent back.andM;This setup is referred to as the client-server model, because the clientworkstation makes requests to the server, which then does all the work,saving your local PC resources and reducing traffic.andP;  For communicationbetween the two PCs, the RDS uses the APPC (Advanced Program-to-ProgramCommunications) service of Communications Manager.andM;The RDS configuration simply asks you what kind of network adaptor you'reusing and which relevant network addresses to use.andP;  The LAN Requestorconfiguration is equally brief.andM;Once you've completed all the stages in your configuration, the setup isverified and then saved to disk--just as with the main 'advancedconfiguration in Communications Manager, which naturally adds facilities forconfiguring new services such as 5250 emulation.andM;One or two points are worth mentioning here.andP;  There's much better support fornetwork adaptors than in the past -- five IBM Token-Ring and the PC Networkadaptors are listed, plus six Ethernet devices, from 3Com, Western Digitaland Ungermann-Bass.andM;This shows a much more open approach by IBM, but it still doesn't really gofar enough.andP;  For true flexibility, IBM should ensure that users are able toinstall any suitable network adaptor -- provided, of course, that thenecessary device drivers are supplied by its manufacturer.andM;I've been told by the designers of Extended Edition that this is definitely agoal, but as one convinced that open systems are good for the whole industry,I wish it would come sooner rather than later.andM;Incidentally, this feature will probably have to be included when ExtendedEdition is unbundled for sale on non-IBM PCs, and I believe that will be withv2.0.andP;  (Details on v2.0 are sketchy at the moment, but we know that it willsupport multiple virtual DOS machines, and parts of it will support the full386 instruction set.)andM;The choice of adaptor is a good example of how the help system in ExtendedEdition is constantly being improved.andP;  When selecting from the adaptor list,pressing F1 brings up a small window with a description of the high-lightedadaptor.andP;  It hardly seems necessary to go to those lengths, but it'srepresentative of most of the system, and it's much more friendly than wadingthrough thick manuals.andM;Before moving on from the configuration aspects.andP;  I'll first briefly mentiontwo more important new features.andM;5250 emulation is for terminal emulation connected to an AS/400 or System/36.andO;It allows up to four host sessions and connection via Coax, SDLC or across anetwork.andM;The other main new feature is X.25.andP;  This isn't included within BCS sinceX.25 isn't a high-level service--rather it's a low-level programminginterface, which is at the same level as the 802.2 and NETBIOS data linkcontrols.andP;  X.25 is most likely to be used for connecting 3270 or 5250emulation sessions to a host machine.andM;Communications Manager itself hasn't changed from the previous versions,except for the addition of extra menus to handle the new services.andP;  It'sstill a text-mode program and doesn't run under Presentation Manager.andM;The only components that have been changed are the screens for 3270 andasynchronous communications which are now windowable (they run in a PMwindow).andP;  You would expect that the 5250 emulation would also work in thisway, but it's, at present, just a text-screen.andM;One final point about Communications Manager.andP;  One of the configurationoption is the 'SNA feature', and this has an important new addition -- agateway facility.andM;This lets you connect a network of PCs to a System/370, via a singleconnection from one PC acting as the gateway.andP;  The connection between thegateway PC and the host can be via SDLC, Token-Ring or X.25, and theworkstations are connected on any of the three supported networks or directlyvia X.25 or SDLC.andM;The workstation PCs can be running either DOS or OS/2 and can use either APPCapplications or 3270 emulation sessions.andP;  You can have up to 256 workstationson the network and a maximum of 64 host sessions can be active at any onetime -- these are allocated from the gateway's session 'pool' of 254 (apuzzling number!).andM;The gateway facility is intended to simplify connecting PC's up to a 370(without the use of a dedicated comms controller) and to allow the PC's to beused for general network purposes.andP;  No doubt the gateway will be enhanced inthe future to allow an extension of Remote Data Services to gain access fromDOS and OS/2 worksations to host databases under DB2 or SQL/DS.andM;The Database Manager has a considerable number of enhancements, the mostimportant being RDS.andP;  This can be set up in two ways, with connection betweenPC's going across a network using LAN Server, or using direct connection ofSDLC or X.25.andP;  Also, suitably written programs running on a DOS workstationare able to access remote data.andM;Your own workstation can access databases on one or more other machinesacting as servers, or it can be used itself as a server, allowing other usersaccess to your local data.andP;  Only the simple case of access to one machine canbe set up using BCS -- otherwise you need to use the advanced configurationin Communications Manager to set up the correct APPC profiles.andM;Information on these is kept in your local Database Manager directories.andO;These hold the routing information to the databases you've catalogued(registered access to).andM;In earlier versions, it worked like this.andP;  Let's say you had Database Manageron drive C, and then you copied another database over from another machine onto another drive on your PC, or maybe on a drive visible to you across thenetwork.andP;  To access it, using Query Manager, you had to give the drive andname of the database.andP;  It was then catalogued and the routing informationstored in your local directories.andM;When you used the system later, the database appeared in the list of thoseyou could open.andM;With RDS this is extended to include the optional first step of cataloguing aremote workstation and then cataloguing databases held on the other machine.andM;From then on, access to the remote database is transparent.andP;  Choose one fromyour list of catalogued databases and the system will check the extendedrouting information, determining if RDS needs to be used.andM;To backtrack a little, the first difference users will notice when using thenew Query Manager is the security system.andP;  As databases are covered by this,you have first to log on to the system.andM;If you don't do this using the log on procedure in User Profile Management,the same log on dialogue box will pop-up when you start Query Manager,requesting your user Id and password (the password is optional -- you don'tneed to have one).andM;UPM lets you manage users by assigning passwords and classifying them asnormal users or administrators.andP;  It also lets you associate them in groups,the permission for which will automatically be assigned to their members --if you don't have a privilege in your own right, you can get it by belongingto a group that has it.andM;The Database Manager security system picks up these same user IDs and letsyou assign specific permissions for them (it works similarly for the LAN).andO;It also lets you nominate groups as having access, and give them the same setof permissions.andP;  These are for opening a database, creating tables and plans,and as a Database Administrator.andM;A Database Administrator can assign permissions for other users, but it can'tcreate or erase databases.andP;  That privilege is reserved for a SystemAdministrator -- someone given authority over the general User ProfileManagement.andM;So, the general security system takes precedence over the database one forthe most important activities, but it doesn't interfere with the basicauthorizations concerned with database access.andP;  The general system is alsothe only way in which passwords can be changed, since the same passworrds areused throughout the system.andM;Further privileges can be controlled using two new SQL statements, GRANT andREVOKE.andP;  They can not only be used for determining users' access to database(the same controls as given earlier), but also to tables, programs andindices.andM;This can only be done by a Database Administrator who'd enter SQL code tochange privileges and be able to check existing ones by looking in to thesystem tables where they're stored.andM;The controllable privileges for tables are the most extensive, and they'relargely self explanatory: ALL, CONTROL, ALTER, DELETE, INDEX, INSERT,REFERENCES, SELECT and UPDATE CONTROL involves also being able to grant andrevoke privileges for other users, and ALL entails all the others in thelist, except CONTROL.andM;REVOKE is used to remove privileges and is used with a similar cyntax toGRANT.andP;  For example, to give user FRED the ability to SELECT data from tableLIST, and insert rows in to it, you would issue the simple statement:andM;GRANT INSERT, SELECT ON TABLE LIST TO FREDandM;The main visible difference with Query Manager is that it's now aPresentation Manager program.andP;  When I first heard this I thought it was a badidea, and said so.andP;  I was wrong.andP;  Because it adheres more to the CUAspecifications, Query Manager is now much easier to use.andP;  It's also muchfaster.andM;Another major new feature is the ability to preserve referential integrity.andO;Here's an example of what that means.andP;  A company might have a table ofemployees and another of the departments in which they work.andP;  The departmentwould be identified in each table by identification numbers, as would all theemployees.andM;The tables can be said to have referential integrity if conditions such asthe following are met: no department or employee lacks an ID, no two IDs areidentical , and no employee exists who doesn't have a valid department ID.andO;That last condition implies a relationship between the two tables, and topreserve referential integrity, actions such as deleting a department recordwhen employees are still assigned to it, should be prevented.andM;Such rules can be built into the database, using either SQL directly, or aprompted interface in Query Manager.andP;  In constructing these relationships,one table is considered to be the parent and one or more others (includingpossibly the parent) are considered dependent tables.andM;In the primary table there must be a column (or group of columns) of uniquevalues called the primary key.andP;  In our example this would be the departmentID in the department table.andP;  In the dependent tables there must be a column(or group) of values called a foreign key which match up with the primary keyin the parent.andP;  This would be the department IDs in the employee table.andM;This type of relationship is very easy to define.andP;  You first identify yourprimary key in the parent table, and then go to another table and choose theforeign key.andP;  As you do this, you nominate which table is to be the parent,and the primary key within it.andP;  You also choose one rule to be applied, outof the following: Restrict Deletes, Cascade Deletes and Set to Null.andM;These are applied if a row is deleted in the parent (delete a department).andO;Either the deletion is prevented if any rows in the dependent table match up(if an employee is assigned to the department), all dependent rows in othertables are also deleted (rather like sacking all the employees of thedepartment), or the matching columns in the dependent tables are set to NULL(rather like flagging all the displaced employees to be reassigned to newdepartments).andM;Other rules that are automatically enforced once dependencies have beenassigned are: values in the primary key can't be changed (that would breakthe relationship); a foreign key can only be changed if it'll still match aprimary row (employee changes department); and a row can only be insertedinto a dependent table if it'll match up with one in the primary (a newemployee can only be taken on if assigned to a department).andM;Many people expected IBM to incorporate referential integrity in a similarway to that used by Sybase's SQL Server.andP;  This uses devices called triggerswhich cause a stored procedure to be executed whenever certain conditionsarise.andP;  The procedure is written in SQL and stored in a table associated withthe database.andM;On first inspection, the SQL Server method is much richer in function thanExtended Edition, but IBM's method is much easier to use and maintain for thepurposes of straightforward referential integrity.andM;If you want the extra function, it's also available, but in a less directmanner.andP;  Extended Edition 1.2 includes stored procedures, although they'renot SQL statements.andM;Instead, they are separate programs that have to be written in a lower levellanguage such as C, and are stored as OS/2 Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).andO;They can contain SQL statements to be executed, and as they're written in amain programming language, they can also do anything else you might wish.andM;But they can't be accessed (triggered) from an SQL statement in your mainprogram, they have to be called like any function in a DLL by a standardprogram function call -- the program itself has to be written to cope withthem.andM;This makes them less easy to develop -- and I'd still like to see stored SQLprocedures in Extended Edition -- but there's no doubt that the methods usedfor maintaining referential integrity are excellent.andM;There are several other enhancements to Database Manager, but lack of spacemeans that I can only touch on a few of them briefly.andM;As it's now a true multi-user system, there are techniques incorporated toensure that multiple users see the latest versions of a record, and don'tinterfere with each other when updating those records.andP;  This is taken care ofby a set of isolation levels that are defined at an application level -- whenthe application is bound to the database.andM;A couple of extra application programming interfaces (APIs) have beenprovided.andP;  First, the API for the database engine itself is now published,which opens the way for program development tools to be produced by thirdparties.andM;At a higher level, there are also APIs for applications to access certainfunctions (menus, reports and so on) within Query Manager and for output ofdata to a third party graphical application.andP;  All of these are intended tomake it easier for developers to create applications integrated into thebasic system.andM;Going back to the broad design goals I outlined earlier (see box, DesignGoals) it's clear that OS/2 v1.2 goes a long way towards satisfying them andhas finally become a proper multi-user system, incorporating advancedtechniques, high performance and ease of use.andP;  There's still a long way to gobefore the homogeneous system planned by IBM is realized, but this presentrelease, due in a few weeks time, makes an excellent basis for a LAN, andsimplifies host connectivity in many areas.andM;Design goalsandM;To understand Extended Edition OS/2 properly, you need to know IBM's generalstrategy for PCs and the system software that runs on them.andP;  Whilestand-alone systems will still play an importan role, the view taken by IBMis that vast numbers will be connected to other machines -- not just locallynetworked, but also linked to minis, mainframes and even wide area networks.andM;They'll also run more than the usual stand-alone applications -- Lotus 1-2-3,word processors and the like.andP;  IBM calls these 'personal productivityapplications' and often defines the new use of PCs as 'line-of-business': inother words, integrating PCs in to the applications which are run on largesystems and hold the main information resources of a company.andM;This data should be accessible through the PC, and should be linked to thepersonal applications where relevant.andP;  With such integration, it's importantthat there should be consistency in the methods of use across all thesystems, and in the forms of communication, programming and so on.andP;  Whetheryou're working on a stand-alone machine, or are accessing data on a mainframewhile linked to a credit bureau ad collating information in a localspreadsheet, you ought to perceive the same type of computing world, and findeach system equally easy to operate.andM;This isn't simple or quick to achieve which is why IBM seems unperturbed bythe fact that OS/2 is perceived by some as 'taking off slowly' -- it couldn'tbe any other way.andM;If personal systems are going to get involved in the running of entirebusiness operations, reliability and error recovery have to be close toinfallible, security must be tight, the system software must be able to growwith advancing technology and the system must be centrally maintainable.andP;  Bythat I mean something like a new version of a program becomes available, andyou don't have to go around shoving floppy disks in to hundreds of PCs.andM;Another important point is that systems cost money, so more function needs tobe available from each PC and training and other human costs must fall.andO;After all, with hardware prices dropping and PCs increasing in number, thehuman cost is ever increasing in relation to the hardware.andM;There's, without doubt, a demand for PCs to work in this manner and thequestion that needs attention is: Does IBM's answer to this need, ExtendedEdition OS/2, fit the bill?andM;Things won't be clear for some time, but the forthcoming v1.2 containsseveral enhancements that fill important gaps.andP;  Most of these are to do withease of use (see Cover Story, issue 117) and connectivity.andP;  But there arealso improvements to Communications Manager; the database system now worksacross a network in the client-server model and security has been improveddramatically.andM;Performance testsandM;To test the performance of the database engine behind Query Manager, I wrotefour C programs using random data to create ASCII delimited files that couldbe read in to Query Manager.andP;  These were then exported in IBM's own format(IXF file) for interchange between different versions of Extended Edition.andM;I'll call these files A to D.andP;  They all contained 50,000 rows of data, exceptB which had 100,000.andP;  They contained ASCII and numeric data and wereapproximately 5Mb, 10Mb, 4Mb and 7Mb in size.andM;I set up the tests on a separate machine from my normal PS/2 Model 70-an ALR486 with plenty of disk space.andP;  I stored the IXF files on drive E, and usedan empty drive D to hold Database Manager and the databases.andP;  The tests wererun using Extended Edition versions 1.1 and 1.2, and then using 1.2 with thenew High Performance File System (HPFS).andM;Each time, I cleared drive D, set up Database Manager and then copied theimport files into its root, erasing them when imported and then running thetests in prcisely the same order.andM;The first timed test was an import of IXF file A.andP;  All the remaining testsused SQL statements.andP;  The first was a SELECT from the table, but using an'ORDER BY' command to ensure the database engine had to work through thewhole table before returning to Query Manager.andP;  The next test involvedupdating values in the table, depending on a combination of values held incertain columns.andP;  These two tests were then repeated on the larger file B.andO;Finally, the two files C and D were imported, and an UPDATE performed ontable C, depending on conditions in the indexed table D (see SQL statementsand Results boxes).andM;The more important performance improvement in v1.2 over 1.1 is the differencein times for the 5Mb and 10Mb databases.andP;  V1.2 is significantly better athandling the large table than is 1.1.andP;  Where the performance of v1.1 degradedwith increased database size, v1.2 doesn't.andM;When I reviewed Standard Edition v1.2, I tried to see if I could detect anyperformanc improvement due to the HPFS.andP;  The tests involved loading largefiles in to something like Excell, and I measured no speed advantage.andP;  Iexpected to see such an advantage only in disk intensive situations and thisbeen borne out with the Extended Edition tests.andP;  Overall, using the HPFS addsan extra 20 per cent to the performance gain.andM;Comparing the figures for v1.2, shows that the performance gain improves withthe quantity of data.andP;  Adveraging the two figures for files A and B, the HPFSgives 14 per cent better performance with the 5Mb file than the normal FATsystem, but 23 per cent improvement with the 10Mb file.andP;  If that continueswith even larger amounts of data, then the HPFS will rapidly earn its keepand become invaluable on fileservers holding large databases.andM;The who's who of OS/2andM;OS/2 v1.0 Standard Edition (240 pounds) - the earliest, test-mode onlyversion.andP;  In the race to be first, a number of software companies producedprograms for 1.0, but it's completely superseded now by later PresentationManager-based versions.andP;  No longer available.andM;OS/2 v1.0 Extended Edition (573 pounds) - text-based again but with theDatabase and Communications Manager extensions.andP;  No longer available.andM;OS/2 v1.1 Standard Edition (240 pounds) - The Windows-like PresentationManager replaced the text mode program selecto.andM;OS/2 v1.1 Extended Edition (573 pounds) - As above, but CommunicationsManager and Database Manager remained as text-only applications.andM;OS/2 v1.2 Standard Edition (256 pounds) - enhanced version featuring adifferent windowing structure for system control, greater use of icons andimproved overall performance.andM;OS/2 v1.2 Extended Edition (611 pounds) - as above with Communications andDatabase Manager properly integrated in to the Presentation Managerenvironment.andM;* Note that an appropriately configured machine for OS/2 is assumed to have aminimum of a 40Mb hard disk, between 4Mb and 6Mb RAM and colour VGA.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
