The state of knowledge on the health effectexerts a dominant influence on this evaluation, which focuses on averagingprocedures, the resolution in space and time, and error propagation.Uncertainties in the cause-effect relationship are the final contributionsto the error of the result. Intermediate calculations should neitherincrease this error unduly nor be carried out with an accuracy significantlybetter than that which can be achieved in estimating the health effects.In this context, a methodology for performing credible calculations withan effort commensurate with the state of knowledge is discussed. 21 references,1 figures, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
