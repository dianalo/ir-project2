LeeStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> UKBUYBACKS, REDEMPTIONS, SWAP OFFERS (BBK)EARNINGS (ERN)CHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM) </IN><TEXT>   Union Carbide Corp. said third-quarter net income fell 74% to $74 million, or 57 cents a share, from $290 million, or $2.94 a share, a year earlier, when results reflected a one-time gain of $252 million.    Profit from continuing operations, however, jumped 76% to $74 million, or 57 cents a share, from $42 million, or 43 cents a share. Carbide said results reflected strong performances by its chemical and plastics businesses. The Danbury, Conn., company also said the per-share figures reflect a 33% increase, to 131.6 million, in the number of shares outstanding this year.    Sales for the third period rose 11% to $1.73 billion from $1.55 billion.    Separately, the company said it would buy back 10 million shares of common on the open market, &quot;depending on developments in the stock market and other factors.&quot;    Carbide shares closed yesterday at $22, down $1.75, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    &quot;The fundamentals of our major businesses are good,&quot; said Carbide Chairman Robert D. Kennedy. &quot;We think the chemical industry is in a strong position after restructuring and we believe there is momentum left in the chemical upturn.&quot;    William R. Young, managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said earnings were &quot;a little better than the expected 50 cents a share, give or take two or three cents.&quot; He added that the results show that Carbide's &quot;earnings momentum for future periods continues to accelerate.&quot;    Carbide said profit for the nine months jumped 80% to $209 million, or $1.60 a share, compared with profit from continuing operations of $116 million, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier. In the year-earlier period, profit from discontinued operations of $17 million, together with a $588 million gain on discontinued operations and a $270 million accounting adjustment made net income $991 million, or $9.56 a share. Sales rose 7% to $5.11 billion from $4.75 billion.    The company said third-quarter results benefited from a $43 million, or 31%, drop in interest costs because of lower debt levels and interest rates. Last month, the company concluded a public offering of asset-backed preferred stock of a finance subsidiary and applied the net proceeds of $245 million to the reduction of long-term debt. The company said interest expense in future periods will be reduced as a result of the transaction.    The year-ago third-quarter results reflected Carbide's sale of its home and automotive products businesses. </TEXT></DOC>
