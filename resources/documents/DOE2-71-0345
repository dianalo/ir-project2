Work in applied physical chemistryincluded investigations into the processes that control the release andtransport of fission products under accident-like conditions, the thermophysicalproperties of metal fuel and blanket materials of the Integral Fast Reactor,and the properties of selected materials in environments simulating thoseof fusion energy systems. In the area of separation science and technology,the bulk of the effort is concerned with developing and implementingprocesses for the removal and concentration of actinides from waste streamscontaminated by transuranic elements. Another effort is concerned withexamining the feasibility of substituting low-energy for high-enricheduranium in the production of fission product {sup 99}Mo. In the areaof waste management, investigations are underway on the performance ofmaterials in projected nuclear repository conditions to provide inputto the licensing of the nation's high-level waste repositories.</TEXT></DOC>
