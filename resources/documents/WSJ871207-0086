Since February 1985, when it hit a low of $281 an ounce, the metal has surged by 73%, perhaps reinforcing its image as the best insurance against dollar weakness and international financial upheaval. However, investors would have fared even better by switching from dollars into other major currencies at that time instead of into gold.    From that month in 1985 -- which also was about the time the dollar reached its peak -- until Friday, the price of gold actually tumbled by 20% when expressed in Swiss francs. It also dropped 18% in West German marks, 14% in Japanese yen and 2% in British pounds. Counting interest earnings foregone on currency investments and any storage costs for holding gold, the gap in favor of the currencies is still wider.    &quot;Measured in hard foreign cash, gold has done badly,&quot; a London gold bullion dealer says. But Canadian, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Far Eastern investors &quot;profited by buying bullion,&quot; he says, as their currencies have depreciated with the dollar.    Even though gold has risen strongly since the Oct. 19 stock market crash, it still paid to hold appreciating currencies in that period. And this year, even some normally downtrodden base metals have outshone gold. Priced in dollars, gold has risen 22% this year; copper, meanwhile, has soared 92%.    The major reason gold is falling short of expectations, analysts say, is that the gold market is being flooded by surging production from around the world.    Western production will rise to an estimated 49.8 million ounces in 1990 from 41.2 million ounces last year, according to Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a U.K. mining house that analyzes precious metals markets. In addition to higher Western production, an increasing amount of gold is being refined from scrap and recycled, and imports of gold from the Soviet Union and China could rise.    &quot;I can't be a super bull on gold, even though it has a chance of rising further,&quot; Ted Arnold, a London-based metals analyst for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith Inc., a unit of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., says.    By the early 1990s, investors and the jewelry industry may have to buy an additional 20 million ounces of gold a year to offset the surplus supply, Mr. Arnold says. This is an amount almost equivalent to South Africa's entire annual production.    Moreover, if a recession takes hold in the major industrial countries, that could depress jewelry purchases, Brian Nathan, mananging director of Ayrton Metals Ltd., a London platinum merchant, says.    While gold is around its 1987 highs, platinum prices have tumbled to around $500 an ounce from a peak of $680 in the autumn of 1986. Silver, another precious metal, jumped to nearly $10 an ounce in March from $5.50 at the beginning of the year but currently is languishing at about $6.80 an ounce.    But although many analysts say the investment demand for coins and bars isn't strong enough to offset the rise in gold supplies, a few remain unperturbed.    Gold prices are remaining firm mainly because the total quantity of the metal available from mines and producers in Communist and non-Communist nations and from scrap fell sharply from last year's record levels, according to Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors, a consulting group. He also says more investors will buy gold in the months ahead because central banks are pumping liquidity into the financial system and cutting interest rates.    Japanese investors, for example, stepped up their purchases of gold in the past few weeks &quot;because they are worried about the dollar and financial markets,&quot; Stephen Tacheuchi, nonferrous metals manager at Sumitomo Corp. (U.K.) Ltd. in London, says.    Japanese imports of gold, some dealers say, could be more than three million ounces in the current quarter, compared with a total of six million ounces in the first nine months of this year.    And if the dollar weakens further, gold is likely to rise past $500 an ounce and attract more investors, Tom Butler, precious metals analyst at Samuel Montagu andamp; Co., a London bullion dealer, says.    Some dealers contend that gold didn't appreciate as much as the European and Japanese currencies did in recent weeks because major central banks were selling gold. But their suspicions haven't been confirmed and in fact have met with widespread skepticism among experienced bullion managers.    Robert Guy, a director of N.M. Rothschild andamp; Sons and chairman of the London gold market, says he would be &quot;very surprised&quot; if major central banks sold gold after the stock market crash.    &quot;The conspiracy theory concerning major central banks isn't well founded and is primarily an excuse for gold bulls who were wrong about the price,&quot; he says.    Mr. Nichols of Precious Metals Advisors, however, estimates that the central banks of Lebanon and of Bolivia and some other South American nations have sold about two million ounces this year. In 1986, according to Consolidated Gold Fields, central banks bought a total of 5.8 million ounces of gold. </TEXT></DOC>
