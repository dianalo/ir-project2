The rating concern also affirmed its ratings on other Tenneco debt. As of Sept. 30, the company had about $6.3 billion of long-term debt outstanding. Sandamp;P cited Tenneco's recently completed sale of its insurance businesses for $1.3 billion, in which proceeds were used to reduce debt. It said that only a modest additional debt reduction appears possible because of Tenneco's comparatively high dividend rate of 76 cents a share and the weak energy market. But Sandamp;P said Tenneco gains important credit support from the diversity of its businesses.    ---   U.S. BANCORP -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed this Portland, Ore.-based bank holding company's debt ratings under review for possible downgrade. Moody's cited the possible negative effect on U.S. Bancorp's funding structure and financial flexibility if the company goes forward with its proposed $174 million acquisition of Old National Bancorp., Spokane, Wash. Moody's said the review covers about $550 million of securities, including U.S. Bancorp's single-A-1 senior debt, its Prime-1 commercial paper, and the long-term deposit obligations, currently rated double-A-2, of the holding company's U.S. National Bank unit. A spokesman said Moody's review &quot;was expected,&quot; in light of the company's acquisition plans. He added that &quot;we have every intention of going forward with the Old National acquisition,&quot; and said the company will make a formal presentation to Moody's analysts when financing plans have been formalized. </TEXT></DOC>
