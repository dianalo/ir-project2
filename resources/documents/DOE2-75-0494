The subjects of the 38 paperscovered theoretical, experimental, and numerical fields in macro- andmicro-mechanics associated with high velocity deformation and fracturein solids, covering metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites. Emphasiswas laid on the fields as: brittleness, ductility, elasto-visco-plastic-stresswaves, adiabatic shear band, crack initation and propagation and dynamicstress concentration.</TEXT></DOC>
