Roedel, president and chief executive officer, said.    The specialty steelmaker's new wage plan breaks with the steel industry pattern by shifting hourly workers to a profit-sharing form of compensation from an output-incentive system. Under the incentive system, workers earned extra pay for producing more goods.    If profits remain flat, the new pay system will cut Carpenter's labor costs an estimated 10% to 12%, beginning in the fourth year, Mr. Roedel said in an interview. If profits increase, workers will receive additional &quot;profit&quot; pay that could bring their total wages and benefits up to the average hourly rate of about $23.50 they receive now.    The new plan takes effect in stages, beginning July 1. Employees will receive as pay 10% of Carpenter's first $40 million of annual pre-tax earnings and 20% of all pre-tax profits in excess of $40 million.    Mr. Roedel didn't make an earnings forecast for fiscal 1987 or 1988, but he indicated that the company anticipates sluggish market conditions and little near-term opportunity for sales growth.    Carpenter plans to reduce its 2,200-member hourly work force starting with an early retirement program now being offered to 350 employees. </TEXT></DOC>
