The yearlong survey, which projects annual housing demand at 1.9 million units through 1990, is the first to dispute widespread projections that housing needs would average about 1.6 million units to 1.7 million units a year through the decade's end. Housing demand, at Salomon's projected levels, would have repercussions far beyond home building. The industry and its support businesses, such as roofers, lumber concerns and cement producers, could as a result of the increased demand contribute to gross national product far more than their current annual average contribution of 4 1/2% to 5%, some economists assert.    Dwight M. Jaffee, a Princeton University economics professor who is one of the study's two authors, said the results are based largely on U.S. census data that include family formations and population statistics as well as changes in bank and thrift regulations; those changed regulations, Mr. Jaffee said, have made it easier to obtain mortgage financing.    However, the study, which is based in large part on U.S. census data, doesn't dispute projections for the industry's future beyond 1990. Like numerous other projections, the New York-based securities firm's report asserts that demand for housing will drop to 1.6 million units through 1995 and decline by 100,000 more units through 2000.    Housing experts generally asserted that the Salomon study, which takes into account demand for single-family, multifamily and mobile home units, is optimistic. &quot;I might be a little more pessimistic . . . but (the study's results) are plausible,&quot; said Allen Sinai, economist with New York investment banker Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Mr. Sinai projects demand for the same four-year period at 1.75 million units to 1.8 million units a year. Michael Carliner, a vice president for economics and housing policy at the National Association of Home Builders, an industry group, pronounced the Salomon projection &quot;as a little high, but not unreasonable.&quot;    The Salomon projection, also prepared by Kenneth T. Rosen, a vice president for real estate, indicates that 300,000 units will be needed each year to replace old houses and that increases in the number of heads of households may produce demand for 300,000 units to 600,000 units a year. The projection of demand for homes at the annual rate of 1.9 million units compares with an average demand of 2.1 million units in the 1970s and and an average demand of 1.7 million units during the first half of this decade. The Salomon study didn't provide a year-by-year projection through 1990, and it wasn't immediately clear whether the projection of 1.9 million units annually disguises a soft 12-month period.    The projections nonetheless are likely to heighten optimism in an industry in the midst of a restructuring. Because of a tapering-off of first-time home buyers, increasing numbers of builders are pursuing second-time, usually more affluent, buyers.    But because builders for silk-stocking consumers aren't typically volume producers, that pursuit of second-time buyers has resulted in a decline in the past two to three years in housing starts and demand. The contraction in demand for first homes, meanwhile, has resulted in a continuing shakeout of several thousand builders. </TEXT></DOC>
