The company said about 400 workers walked out and about 100 have returned to work. The production and maintenance workers at the plant voted in January to be represented by the United Steelworkers and have been negotiating a labor agreement since March.    Trinity, which makes and fabricates metal products, said the union hasn't told it why the workers are on strike. </TEXT></DOC>
