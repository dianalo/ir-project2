S. market for information systems appears to be taking a back seat toother world regions, judging from research data.andP;  But chief informationofficers at U.S.andP;  corporations tell a different story.andM;Although sluggish U.S.andP;  demand for information technology catches much of theblame for the computer industry's current woes, there is in fact an enormousneed for certain types of IT that's largely going unmet.andP;  Standards-basedcomputers, networks and software that would enable users to distributeprocessing across their enterprises are in short supply.andP;  The reason suchdemand isn't being met is immaturity.andP;  Suppliers and users of It just haven'tgrown up enough to fully cooperate on developing products and services thatwill achieve enterprisewide objectives.andM;The need-identified by DATAMATION in scores of interviews with top isexecutives in the United States-suggests a far different demand picture forIT than the one painted in economic forecasts or even in our own quantitativeresearch findings.andP;  In this year's DATAMATION 100 analysis, for example, U.S.andO;users come across as far less voracious in their appetite for technology thando their counterparts in Western Europe and the Far East.andM;These numbers and those churned out by economists, although useful in manyother respects, belie the need expressed by users for distributed-computingcomponents, such as networked workstations, that can be adapted easily totheir businesses.andP;  &quot;Everything is changing.andP;  And we need technology thatreflects that fact,&quot; says Fran Dramis, chief information officer and amanaging director at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York City.andP;  The financialservices firm is investing huge sums in computers that can be plugged in andpulled out at will as the firm's business changes.andP;  Much of Salomon's ITinvestment is going toward machines built with reduced instruction setcomputing  (RISC) architectures and the UNIX operating system.andM;Worse yet, economic and research data-if used or interpreted improperly--canalter the behavior of U.S.andP;  users in a way that will come back to haunt themas they struggle to compete  in global markets.andP;  Such data can turn usersaway from making the IT investments needed to drive revenues and productivityupward.andM;Here, then, is a view of IT demand as it really exists in the United Statestoday.andP;  It's one that does not discard quantitative analysis' but ratherseeks to represent it in the proper context.andP;  It's also one that examines newways of measuring returns on IT investments-gauges that, if embraced by U.S.andO;users, may drive revenues of DATAMATION 100 companies to new heights.andM;Economists agree that the U.S.andP;  economy this year will flirt with, but notenter, a recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth inthe overall economy): They expect the country's gross national product (GNP)to grow at around  2% in 1990, down from 2.9% in 1989.andP;  Given this slowergrowth, and after factoring in interest rates,  patterns in businessequipment purchases and government spending, the U.S.andP;  Department of Commercepredicts that hardware shipments by U.S.andP;  suppliers will increase by only 4%this year tb $73 billion.andP;  A separate agency study estimates that the U.S.andO;market for software will grow around 18% to $27 billion in 1990.andM;Where the U.S.andP;  Economy is HeadedandM;There's also consensus that GNP growth will expand to 3% in 1991, wheninterest rates are expected to have eased a point or so to the 9% range.andO;Such favorable economic factors, coupled with the beginning of a new productcycle for large-scale systems for IBM and its competitors, will drive ITdemand by U.S.andP;  users back up, Commerce Department officials and othersbelieve.andP;  Cahners Economics forecasts a 16% jump in U.S.andP;  computer and officeequipment purchases next year, coming off a mild increase (6%) this year.andM;But do these economic indicators really show what is happening to IT? Onlypartly, in the eyes of many top information system (IS executives.andP;  &quot;They arewhat you might call trailing edge  indicators,&quot; says Robert J. Olsen,director of strategic information systems at the University of Texas' MDAnderson Cancer Center in Houston.andP;  &quot;They don't measure the leading edge, thethings we are getting into or trying to get into, such as network computing.andO;&quot; The popular single-digit indicators of IT growth are only a reflection, inDramis' words, &quot;of the hardware past the industry is dragging along, not thefuture it's popular single-digit indicators of IT growth are only areflection, in Dramis' words, &quot;of the hardware past the industry  is draggingalong, not the future it's trying to build.&quot;andM;Client/Server Systems SoarandM;Other observers insist that looking at IT demand as a whole is misleading.andO;&quot;You must always ask: &quot;Which IT industry are we talking about?' &quot; says MarkD. Stahlman, a securities analyst at Alex.andP;  Brown andamp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore.andO;&quot;There are many, just as there are many types of IT budgets.andP;  &quot;andM;The economists are right in saying that mainframes, minicomputers andstand-alone PCs are mature, Stahlman believes-that is, exhibit single-digitgrowth.andP;  &quot;But networked workstations, client/ server configurations andsoftware are booming,&quot; Stahlman says.andP;  &quot;They are the new world of demand thatis emerging-&quot;andM;&quot;Clients&quot; are any intelligent desktop systems capable of running a robustapplication in concert with a server, whether it be a dedicated print- orfile-server or a minicomputer or mainframe acting in such a capacity.andM;Workstation shipments by U.S.andP;  manufacturers should increase 40t, in 1990'to$9 billion and nearly quadruple in value to $24 billion during the next fiveyears, according to the  Department of Commerce.andP;  Masking this explosivegrowth, of course, is the stodgy overall average for :he industry.andM;For, while the overall economic indicators suggest a maturing industry andover capacity, Stahlman and others are convinced that the major problem withthe IT industry is actually undersupply.andP;  &quot;Users have spent roughly $100billion to $150 billion worldwide on PCs in retraining professional workersto perform tasks previously carried out by clerk-typists,&quot; Stahlman pointsout.andP;  &quot;But that's not the type of productivity they are after.&quot; Whatcorporate IT buyers in the United States want to do is leverage theproductivity of some 40 million professional workers (including managers,sales and technical personnel).andP;  But the nature of the work they do, heexplains, is an open-ended network of tasks and relationships that calls formuch more sophisticated network-based technologies than are currentlyavailable in the commercial arena.andM;Such technologies have already surfaced in embryonic form in the technicaland manufacturing arenas, where they are employed in the group orientedprocesses of product design and the integration of design with manufacturingand distribution.andM;Competition Drives IT investmentsandM;Such group-oriented &quot;social computing&quot;-so named because it is applied to abroad matrix of information-based social interactions-will become a majorfeature of the office landscape from 1993 onwards, in Stahlman's estimation,anchoring explosive growth in the IT industry.andP;  He expects annual sales ofsocial-computing components to reach $50 billion by the end of the decade,building up to an installed base of systems worth $200 billion.andM;Right now, U.S.andP;  users like American Express Co. and Salomon Brothers are atthe leading (and, perhaps, bleeding) edge in pursuing their social-computingsystems strategies.andP;  These often risky investments re being made at a time ofslow growth in the economy and don't reflect the notion  currently  gainingpopularity with economists that the economy and IT spending move in step, or&quot;As with the economy so with IT.&quot; But, then, CIOs don't buy this notion,anyway.andM;&quot;If there is a parallel in any year between what the economy is doing andwhat the IT business is doing, it's probably coincidental,&quot;  Phil Jordan, cioand vice president of finance at Muzak L.P.andP;  in Seattle, the folks whosetunes are heard in elevators, dentists' offices and elsewhere.andP;  &quot;Companieswill invest in the face of a recession or to catch up with the co pet ordistance themselves from the competition.andP;  Every company has its own dynamicsand its own special reasons for buying IT.&quot;andM;There are exceptions, of course-users whose IT investments definitely are afunction of economic variables.andP;  The health care industry is one.andP;  &quot;Hospitalsoften have to be reimbursed by the state for their services.andP;  And if thestate is in an economic mess, they don't get reimbursed,&quot; says the Universityof Texas' Olsen.andM;Where competitive strategies do drive IT investments-the rule, in mostcases-the risk for riding on the edge of technology doesn't just fall on theshoulders of is executives.andP;  Sharing the burden--and, of course, the creditif IT investments pay off--are an increasing number of other individuals inthe business units who also specify and buy IT products.andM;Respondents on this year's DATAMATION budget survey guessed that an averageof almost 34% of their IT purchases in 1989 ha  d been made outside the isorganization, 42.5% in the public sector.andP;  Diane L. Lockwood, an associateprofessor of MIS at Seattle University refers to such spending as &quot;offline&quot;and says it usually appears under decentralized departmental budgets and sois difficult to keep track of and often does not get included in estimates ofIT spending.andM;&quot;End-user  spending  has  been  growing ...andP;  [probably] at the 15 or 20%growth level, but it's difficult to know for sure,&quot; says Raymond Wiltshire,vice president of computer-aided productivity at Martin Marietta Corp. inBethesda, Md.andP;  The only thing we know for sure is that business units arealways spending more on IT than we think they are.andP;  &quot;andM;The result? Few user organizations in the United States have any idea whatthey are really spending on IT.andP;  Most are in the dark as to how theseexpenditures relate to their overall productive capacity or the economy as awhole.andP;  They  just don't know whether technology is helping to write a betterinsurance policy, produce a more accurate debit/ credit statement, bring atoy to market quickly or create a car worth driving.andM;Why ignorance isn't BlissandM;This ignorance is a result of what one top European consultant calls afragmentary view of iT, which is most pervasive in the United States.andP;  PaulReynolds has worked with U.S.andP;  companies, but mostly provides advice onproblem solving and decision making to the boards of such top Europeanestablishments as British Petroleum, Daimler-Benz and Royal Dutch Shell.andP;  He,and the company he heads, Wentworth Management Consultants Ltd. in London,also counsels governments.andP;  His European clients have taken the trouble tofind out how IT relates to and could improve all of their economic activity,not just portions of it.andP;  &quot; Shell, for example, now knows that 6.3% of allits economic activity is IT-related,&quot; Reynolds says.andP;  &quot;Many Americancompanies would be hard pressed to come up with such a measure.andP;  &quot;andM;U.S.andP;  users have been content to measure IT's contribution to corporateperformance in other ways.andP;  For example, IT spending is often expressed as apercentage of total sales: 2 to 5% of total sales is normal, depending onindustry.andP;  Expressed as a percentage of total general expenses, IT accountsfor some 4 to I 0%, again depending on the industry.andP;  Then there's IT as apercentage of discretionary capital expenditures: here anything from 30 to40% is today the norm.andM;&quot;How much of this is really useful?&quot; wonders Reynolds.andP;  &quot;Isn't it better tohave a measure of IT that relates to all spending and all a company'seconomic activity? ...andP;  Surely, until we do this, we don't know what demandfor IT really is.andP;  We don't know what we're talking about.&quot;andM;If U.S.andP;  companies do develop new, more embracing measures for IT, Reynoldspredicts that industry growth will surge.andP;  &quot;The IT budgets of these companieswill climb as they become more aware of what their true needs are,&quot; he says.andO;Some of his clients, he claims, have been increasing their budgets by as muchas 35%.andP;  Much of this investment has gone toward the creation of an opensystems technology infrastructure, which can adapt quickly to changing worldconditions.andM;Aside from ignorance, Reynolds believes,  the biggest drag on IT spending maybe the is bud et itself, because funds within it are still viewed by manychief executives as overhead.andP;  &quot;When Shell's Belgium subsidiary decided toget rid of all its internal IT resources, its budget was growing at around15% a year.andP;  Since farming everything out, IT-related expenditures haveincreased 75%,&quot; he reveals.andM;Where Open Systems Suppliers ExcelandM;A study of his European clients has also brought to light another interestingfact, says Reynolds.andP;  Only 15% of their total hardware/software budget fornew applications is being spent on products and services offered by theworld's top 20 suppliers.andP;  The rest is being spent on goods sold by an arrayof small, unsophisticated but very innovative companies.andM;Reynolds' message is also being echoed by a small, but  growing  number ofU.S.andP;  users-notably in manufacturing and in the brokerage and accountingsectors of the financial services industry.andP;  These users are investing newnetworked-computing infrastructures-technology conduits that move criticaldata to all relevant decision makers at high speed and disseminate changesthroughout the firm.andP;  The infrastructure includes everything from theworkstation on a professional's desk to the network facilities and thecollection of servers, hosts and da resources.andM;&quot;Our infrastructure is like a puzzle to be put together as we conduct ourbusiness, and [it is] rearranged each day,&quot; says Salomon's Dramis.andP;  &quot;Only theopen systems vendors and the young, innovative companies seem to understandthis.&quot;andM;Dramis and the others have discovered that what they are really demanding istechnology that is &quot;everywhere and nowhere,&quot; in the words of best-sellingauthor Tom Peters, addressing executives at a recent forum of CIOs gatheredtogether by the accounting firm Coopers andamp; Lybrand.andP;  The industry is tooimmature yet to deliver it, and nobody, least of all the economists and ITbudget makers, has yet found a way to measure it.andM;One shouldn't blame the economists.andP;  They agree with Reynolds that theirassumptions are based on incomplete data, but they say the onus is on thecorporations to express demand in new and more comprehensive ways.andM;&quot;Only consumers tell the story of what IT demand truly is,&quot; says MadelineFranchi, a senior economist at Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass.andP;  &quot;If theyexpress as overhead, or as a percentage of costs or capital, then that's allwe have to go on.andM;Franchi and Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist at the Lexington,Mass.-based macroeconomics research house Data Resources Inc., say they areboth comfortable talking about the economy as a whole, but not its impact onIT or vice-versa.andP;  &quot;I simply don't know,&quot; says Latta, candidly.andP;  &quot;It's easyto see why.&quot;andM;The companies that lost moneyandM;1989                       1989 EARNINGSandM;RANK       COMPANY            LOSS ($ MIL.)andM;1    35      CDC                     (680.4)andM;2     5      Unisys                   639.0)andM;3    21      Wang                    (511.0)andM;4    39      Prime                   (276.8)andM;5    43      Data General            (120.7)andM;6    99      Norsk Data               (60.4)andM;7    28      Memorex                  (54.2)andM;8       8    Groupe Bull              (41.8)andM;9    90      MAI Basic Four           (40.0)andM;10    78      Wyse                     (21.2)andM;The companies with the highest returns on salesandM;1989                   1989 % RETURN 1988 % RETURNandM;RANK COMPANY                ON SALES          ON SALESandM;1   50     Microsoft              22.1%            21.1%andM;2   57     Oracle                 12.7%            18.5%andM;3   84     Novell                 12.2%            11.3%andM;4   70     Lotus                  12.2%            12.6%andM;5   36     ADP                    11.6%            11.0%andM;6   1 6    Compaq                 11.6%            12.4%andM;7   56     Cray                   11.3%            20.7%andM;8   85     Mentor                 10.7%            11.1%andM;9   91     Quantum                10.51/,           1.4)%andM;1 0    44     Computer Associates    10.3%            15.4%andM;Why IT Is a Factor of ProductionandM;Matching the demand of goods and services with the supply of them has becomeinformation technology's role in the 1990s, as global competition places apremium on efficiency.andM;In the good old days-when money was cheap, labor plentiful and marketsundisturbed  by foreign rivals--producers could get away with managing andcoordinating the flow of their goods throughout the Western economy usingonly people and paper.andP;  Moreover, their customers  were content to wait weeksfor new orders to be filled--relying on massive inventories of productsalready shipped  to them.andP;  But population growth is slowing, the number  ofskilled workers is  diminishing and the cost of money is rising.andP;  Competitorsare everywhere.andP;  And customers are impatient-they want everything yesterday.andM;&quot;If you can't get cheap labor or cheap money, what's left?&quot; asks EverettEhrlich, vice president of finance and economic planning at Unisys Corp. inBlue Bell, Pa.andM;What's left, of course, is information technology as Japanese corporationshave so ably demonstrated.andP;  In the 1960s, when with labor shortages andrising wages, Japan's leading manufacturers invested heavily in if, and inthe process achieved wide gains in productivity.andM;What the japanese and others have learned, says Ehrlich, is how to makeinformation (and, by association, IT) a vital factor of production.andP;  &quot;IT hasbecome stibstitutable for labor and capital, or alternatively allows laborand capital to be more productive,&quot; the Unisys executive says.andM;Faced with overseas competition, high interest rates and a tight labormarket, U.S.andP;  manufacturers have had to learn the same lesson.andP;  Since thecurrent U.S.andP;  economic expansion began in late 1982, design andmanufacturing, processes integrated through IT have become the order of theday.andP;  The economy is beginning to reflect this shift.andP;  &quot;The ratio ofinventory to sales has gone down continually since 1982,&quot; says Cynthia Latta,senior financial economist at Data Resources Inc.andM;Inventory behavior is now completely different in the U.S.andP;  [than it used tobe],&quot; says Raymond Wiltshire, chief information officer and vice president ofcomputer-aided productivity at aerospace manufacturer Martin Marietta Corp.andO;&quot;There are no longer the inventory overhangs that are emblematic of the endof the business cycle.andP;
