Terms weren't disclosed.    Royal Trustco said Focobank, which has 60 employees and three branch outlets in Vienna, will be renamed Royal Trust Bank (Austria). The bank's current management will stay in place. Royal Trustco said the purchase is part of its plan to expand its international banking operations. It didn't previously hold any Austrian interests.    Royal Trustco is Canada's second-largest trust concern, which is similar to a U.S. thrift.
