Last month, MCI admitted violating the state's ethics codefor lobbyists, and paid a $10,000 civil penalty and filedamended lobbying reports under a settlement with the StateEthics Commission. The case stemmed from two golftournaments, one in 1988 and the other in 1989, at a clubnear Hartford. Several Connecticut lawmakers attended.</LP><TEXT>   The ethics code bars companies and lobbyists from spendingmore than $50 a year on entertainment and gifts for stateofficials. Typically, companies submit lobbying formsindicating gifts and entertainment are within the limit; thecompanies collect the difference between the $50 and theactual costs from the state officials who attend the specialcorporate events.   On forms submitted to the Ethics Commission, MCI, whichhad hired a Hartford lobbying firm for advice, said it spent$49.99 for each state official both years. In the settlement,it acknowledged that costs, including greens fees, golfcarts, prizes, food and beverages and even portions of thesalaries of MCI employees, totaled $507.78 per person in 1988and $661.46 per person last year.   Robert Jackson, director of external affairs at MCI'sNortheast division, said that the state had not insisted onthat type of costing in the past. Nonetheless, he said, MCIhad made enough unintentional mistakes that it decided to&quot;settle the case, pay a negotiated fine and get this thingbehind us.&quot; He blamed part of the problem onmiscommunications with the hired lobbying firm over whetherto include such expenses as greens fees and golf-cart rentalsin the lobbying reports, and much of the problem on a shiftin procedures and attitudes at the ethics commission.   Mr. Jackson said he &quot;doubted seriously that there is anymerit&quot; to the state investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
