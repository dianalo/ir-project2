Minor clashes erupted in sixcities, and five students were reported injured.   The government enforced strict security measures to blockpreparations for a march to the border Monday by students planningtalks with communist North Korean student delegates. About 30,000riot police were deployed nationwide.   About 400 students armed with firebombs and rocks clashed withriot police in the southern port city of Pusan as they were blockedfrom marching, authorities said. Five students were injured, theysaid.   ``Advance national unification through student talks!'' studentschanted.   Scattered clashes were also reported in the southwestern city ofKwangju, where riot police fired tear gas to break up a march byabout 300 students. Twenty students were arrested after minorstreet protests in Masan in the south.   Bands of students hurled firebombs at a police station in theeastern city of Wonju and at an office of the government party inTaegu in the south, police said. No injuries were reported.   On Wednesday, radical students attacked 12 police stations andgovernment party offices nationwide, according to police reports.   Students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police after a rallyat Donggok University in Seoul when they were blocked frommarching. Police drove the students back into the campus with teargas.   Peaceful rallies to support the reunification talks were held atseveral other Seoul colleges. Riot police stood guard outside, butstudents did not march out and there were no confrontations.   The government has banned the march and reunification talks ongrounds that it alone has the authority to conduct talks withcommunist North Korea. A similar march June 10 for reunificationtalks was blocked by riot police.   Turnout for rallies and marches to Seoul to join the main marchhas been low, with no more than a few hundred studentsparticipating in most cities.   A summer heat wave, summer vacation and strong public oppositionappear to have reduced support for the radicals. North Korea hassaid it will send student delegates to the talks site, but they areseen as being under government control.   Opposition lawmaker Rep. Park Kwang-yong said radical studentswere ready to delay talks with North Korean delegates if they areallowed to stage a march across the nation.   Government officials said there was no change in their positionand no talks would be allowed. The government has offered toarrange meetings with North Korea students under its auspices.   Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to tryto mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign. Thestudents, a small, but powerful minority on college campuses, havefailed to gain support because of their violent tactics and openadvances to the North.   The students say they are not communists, but insist that thepeninsula must be reunited immediately with political differencesbeing worked out later. Most South Koreans fear the totalitariannorth is determined to conquer the south.   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of WorldWar II. North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to start the KoreanWar, which ended three years later with an armistice but nopolitical settlement.</TEXT></DOC>
