Some said traders were anticipating new moves by oil producingcountries to trim their excessive output, bringing world supply anddemand closer into balance. Others, noting that continuousprofit-taking had dampened the rally Friday, suggested that itlacked strong conviction.   Contracts for April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark U.S. crude, closed 29 cents higher at $16.29 per42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, adding toThursday's strong 51-cent gain.   Refined products also built on Thursday's robust advance.Wholesale heating oil settled at 44.69 cents a gallon, up 0.76 centafter Thursday's 0.90 cent gain. Wholesale unleaded gasoline closedat 45.59 cents a gallon, up 0.45 cent after leaping 1.14 centsThursday.   ``There's a growing confidence that, by whatever means it mighttake, our oil-exporting friends will contain the discounting andget prices moving up,'' said Bob Baker, an analyst forPrudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Since late last year, sluggish demand and growing surpluses haveput downward pressure on oil prices. That weakness was aggravatedby discounting on the part of members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries.   Analysts said the 13-nation cartel has been sticking to itsaggregate quota of 17.5 million barrels a day, but that the totalgoal, set in December, was simply too high for the world's needs.   As a result, by early this week prices had eroded to levelsbetween $13 and $14 per barrel in the Persian Gulf _ far short ofOPEC's $18 target _ and to $15.37 per barrel on the New York Merc,$2 to $3 cheaper than January levels.   Indications that worried OPEC and non-member countries wereattempting to find ways to boost those prices sent the marketstrongly higher Thursday _ although crude had picked up 12 cents inlight trading on Tuesday and Wednesday.   While crude continued to gain ground in Friday's session,however, product prices did not ``put in all that good a showing,''said Jayne Ball, an analyst at the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.securities firm.   ``At this point, it's unclear whether this is just a technicalcorrection ... or whether it's a serious recovery,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
