Theannual production of brown coal is 300 Mt. Brown coal is used to generateheat and power in thermal power stations (55%), in briquetting plants(35%) and in coking plants. Bucket wheel and bucket chain excavatorsare used to mine brown coal deposits. Main characteristics of brown coaldeposits and of major surface brown coal mines that exploit thick browncoal seams (Nochten, Berzdorf and Welzow) are described. Aspects of coalquality, coal conversion (gasification, liquefaction and briquetting),coal transport and coal handling (stacking and blending) are discussed.5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
