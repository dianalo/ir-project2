StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN CANDA FRESTMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   Last week's gusher in oil prices spilled into the foreign exchange market, creating opportunities that currency traders are trying to capitalize on.    The big winners so far have been the currencies of net oil exporters: the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the Norwegian krone. Meanwhile, the currencies of net oil importers -- such as the Japanese yen and West German mark -- have been hurt.    The main exception to this pattern has been the U.S. dollar, which climbed late last week despite the U.S.'s status as a net oil importer. Traders said its rise was partly a reaction to the currency being oversold Wednesday, when it plunged on news that the U.S. trade deficit widened in May.    But higher oil prices also are viewed as increasing the world's demand for dollars, as transactions in the crude oil market generally are conducted in the U.S. currency.    The oil rally was touched off by mounting tensions in the Persian Gulf and fears that the Iran-Iraq war will spread and block the flow of oil from the region. That concern is likely to increase this week as the U.S. begins offering Navy protection to Kuwaiti oil tankers, which have been frequent targets of Iranian air attacks.    Because of Britain's position as the only major oil exporter among countries with widely traded currencies, the pound was the biggest beneficiary of the problems in the Middle East. Anthony J. Murphy, senior dealer and sterling trader at Royal Bank of Canada's New York branch, said last week that speculators were &quot;looking at the Middle East, contemplating a conflict&quot; and buying the pound aggressively.    North Sea oil production represents 6% of Britain's gross national product. This year, it will contribute #6.7 billion ($10.74 billion) to the nation's export revenue, or 8.5% of its total export revenue, according to David Morrison, vice president and chief international economist at Goldman Sachs International Corp., London.    But economists and traders say Britain's role as an oil exporter is only half the story behind sterling's strength. The other half is that certain other major economies, notably those of Japan and West Germany, are almost totally dependent on imported oil.    &quot;It's not just that Britain wins (from higher oil prices); the others lose,&quot; Mr. Morrison said. &quot;There's a double whammy.&quot;    Because Japan is viewed as the biggest loser from high oil prices among major industrialized nations, the most popular foreign-exchange &quot;petroleum play&quot; is in the sterling-yen cross rate, traders said. Against the Japanese currency, sterling rose 0.8% last week to 245.18 yen.    &quot;The status of sterling as a petrocurrency has been reaffirmed,&quot; Marc M. Goloven, vice president and economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said.    The Canadian dollar is another beneficiary of rising oil prices. Oil normally represents around 5% of Canada's exports, although the proportion fell to 3.1% last year because of the decline in prices, Trevor W. Woodland, vice president, foreign exchange, at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank in Chicago, said. Canada also benefits as a major producer of natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power and other commodities with prices that follow petroleum's, Mr. Woodland, a Canadian dollar specialist, said.    Norway, Britain's partner in North Sea oil production, also can count on currency strength from buoyant oil prices. But professionals are wary about speculating in the Norwegian krone because of the shallow market for the currency and the government's policy of keeping a close watch over its exchange rate. The Norwegian central bank recently intervened in the foreign exchange market to counter the krone's rise.    Last week, the Norwegian krone climbed 1.1% to 22.63 yen. The mark stood Friday at 3.6488 Norwegian kroner, off slightly from 3.6496 a week earlier.    Despite &quot;arguments on both sides,&quot; the dollar tends to rise with oil prices, Mr. Goloven of Manufacturers Hanover said. The primary negative effects of more expensive oil for the U.S. are inflation and a higher import bill, which worsens the trade deficit. However, &quot;you can't overlook the (positive) effect&quot; on oil-producing areas within the U.S., Mr. Goloven said.    Perhaps more significantly, as world oil prices rise, so does demand for the dollars in which most oil exporters want to be paid. Moreover, the oil exporters' increased income should ultimately add to investment flows to the U.S., further supporting the dollar, several economists said.    Friday Currency Activity   The dollar continued to show strong gains and moved into a higher trading range.    In late New York trading, the currency stood at 152.95 Japanese yen, up 1.5% from 150.70 Thursday. It also climbed 1.3% to 1.8625 West German marks from 1.8390. The pound fell 1.6% against the U.S. currency to $1.6030 from $1.6296.    Many traders said the rise was essentially technical, correcting what is now seen as the dollar's excessive drop on Wednesday's news of a widened U.S. trade deficit.    &quot;You have a market that grossly oversold following the trade figures and has now been scrambling to right itself,&quot; Robert Hatcher, vice president, foreign exchange, at Barclay's Bank PLC in New York, said.    Other traders said the rise reflected concern about a possible sharpening of the Persian Gulf conflict.    &quot;Most of (the rise) is a reaction to possible crises in the Mideast,&quot; James M. Pugh, vice president, corporate foreign exchange, at Manufacturers Hanover, said. The dollar's rally represents a &quot;flight to security,&quot; he said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $6.10 an ounce to $448.10 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was four million ounces.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Friday, July 17, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
