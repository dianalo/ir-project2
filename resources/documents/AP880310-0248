Bushsaid whatever happened, his campaign would ``go about our business,do our job.''   Bush, meanwhile, declared himself ``personally disturbed at thebreaches of ethics'' he'd seen in government, and said Thursday hewould set up a White House ethics panel if elected president.   Dole pulled television commercials off the air in Illinois andlaid off more than half his staff Thursday. And a source said hiscampaign advisers discussed whether Dole should suspend campaigningbefore the Illinis primary on Tuesday.   An ABC News-Washington Post poll, published in Friday's editionsof the Post, indicated Dole trailed Bush in Illinois, 58 percent to31 percent.   However, national campaign spokeswoman Dale Tate said Doleintended to remain a candidate. ``We're not pulling the plug on thecampaign,'' she said.   Later, Dole aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thepossibility of dropping out was discussed, but the Kansas senatorwould keep campaigning at least through Tuesday's Illinois contest.   Dole issued a statment Thursday night denying he would withdraw.``Bob Dole is no dropout,'' he said. ``I'm in this one to win.''   The Dole developments came the same day that Bush's SuperTuesday victories claimed another Republican _ Jack Kemp. AndDemocrat Gary Hart was preparing to quit the Democratic race.   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, told reporters travelingwith the vice president that on hearing reports about Dole, Bush'sreaction was: ``We'll go about our business, do our job.''   Democrat Richard Gephardt, who ran a poor fourth among Democratson Tuesday, said Michigan could decide his fate.   Republican Pat Robertson, who finished a distant third to Bushand Sen. Bob Dole in the Super Tuesday contests, said, ``Strangethings happen in politics, so I have no reason to get out.''However, Robertson, campaigning in Chicago, said he planned to buyno television ads in Illinois, which has its primary next Tuesday.   He said he expected to pick up a bit of support fromconservatives who had backed Kemp.   Bush flew to Illinois to press his campaign for the 82 GOPdelegates at stake in the state's primary. And he quickly took up anew issue, saying he was ``tired of being embarrassed'' by scandalssurrounding public officials, though he named no names.   Democrats Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson and Albert Gore Jr.also campaigned in Illinois for a share of the 173 delegates atstake in their party's primary there.   Rep. Gephardt, D-Mo., who is focusing on Michigan, was joiningthe other hopefuls in Chicago for a dinner and town meetingThursday night.   Bush, speaking about what he would do if elected president,promised to create the ethics panel and also to set up a deficitsummit with congressional leaders on ``day one'' of hisadministration.   ``When a congressman goes bad or someone in the executive branchviolates the public trust, it hurts,'' Bush told a Governor's Clubluncheon at the Chicago Hilton. ``I'm tired of being embarrassed.I'm tired of seeing our children seeing things that shouldembarrass us all. People at all levels of government should come toserve, not to profit.''   ``Clearly, I have big plans,'' he told the audience ofRepublican boosters, who sat silently throughout the speech.   Kemp withdrew from the GOP field after a string of third- andfourth-place finishes in the early primaries and caucuses. But theNew York congressman hinted that he would be interested in the No.2 spot on the ticket.   ``Obviously you don't make plans to run for vice president,''Kemp said at a Capitol Hill news conference. But he called the idea``a very flattering and awesome thought. ... Would I think aboutit? The answer to that is yes.''   Kemp refused to endorse any of the remaining Republicancontenders. ``They're all Reagan conservatives,'' he said.   The embattled Hart, who polled no more than 5 percent of thevote in any of the Super Tuesday primaries and won no conventiondelegates, planned to announce his withdrawal from the campaign ata news conference on Friday in Denver, said sources who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   The departure would mark the second time the one-time Democraticfront-runner had quit the 1988 race. Hart withdrew last May afterquestions were raised about his relationship with model Donna Rice.   Gephardt, who also faired poorly on Super Tuesday, issued anultimatum to his own campaign: Michigan or bust.   ``If we don't do well here obviously we aren't going to be ableto continue in this race,'' the Missouri congressman said before arally in Lansing. ``Our real thrust, our real force is going to bein Michigan,'' which has its caucus on March 26.   The Gephardt campaign plans to shore up its forces in Michiganwith as many as 70 paid staffers, who are scheduled to arrive bynext week. In comparison, the campaign has about 20 paid staffersin Illinois.   Gephardt bristled at suggestions that his candidacy would sufferthe same fate as Kemp's.   ``Unlike Jack Kemp, I have been in the middle of this race fromthe beginning,'' he said. ``I have a delegate count that is withinstriking distance of being back in the leadership.''   Dole, who failed to capture any Super Tuesday states from Bush,focused on the vice president's chances of winning in Novemberagainst any of the Democratic candidates.   ``My view is it's going to be a very tough, tough race forGeorge Bush,'' Dole said in Chicago. ``He does not attractDemocrats or independents.''   ``I would be a much stronger candidate. That's the message we'regoing to try to make in the next couple of days,'' he said.   Gore also questioned whether his party's front-runner,Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis, could defeat the Republican nominee inNovember.   ``The people want a president who understands it's necessary tofight for working men and women, not a technocratic manager,'' Goresaid as he greeted commuters at a downtown Chicago mass transitstop. ``For those who want another election blowout and see theDemocratic party losing 49 of 50 states, vote for Mike Dukakis.''   Jackson, who is expected to do well in Illinois, challengedvoters in Wheaton to continue his Super Tuesday success.   ``A generation must dare to hope,'' Jackson told students atWheaton College. ``Super Tuesday has come and gone. We were No. 1or No. 2 in 17 states. Lots of gold and silver medals. ... Thepeople responded.''   Jackson and Dukakis were favored to pick up some of the 12delegates at stake in Alaska, which held caucuses Thursday night.</TEXT></DOC>
