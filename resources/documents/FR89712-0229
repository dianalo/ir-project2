Richeson, SeniorStaff Veterinarian, Import-Export Products Staff, Veterinary Services,APHIS, USDA, Room 759, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,MD 20782, (301) 436-8144.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The regulations in 9 CFR Part 92 set forth, among other things, the conditionsunder which animal semen from countries affected with rinderpest or foot-and-mouthdisease (FMD) may be imported into the United States. These requirementsare contained in andSection; 92.4(d). Generally, these requirements includeimportation under a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) permit;inspection of the donor animals by a USDA veterinarian; determination bya USDA veterinarian that the donor animals have not been exposed to orvaccinated against rinderpest or FMD; isolation of the donor animals ata USDA-approved facility beginning prior to semen collection and continuinguntil blood tests have been completed with negative results; and supervisionby a USDA veterinarian of semen collection, preparation for shipment, andshipment.On March 28, 1989, we published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 12639-12642, Docket Number 89-021) a proposalto add to Part 92 certain requirements specifically designed for importationof porcine semen from China.Our proposal invited the submission of written comments, which were requiredto be postmarked or received on or before April 12, 1989. We subsequentlyreopened and extended that comment period to consider comments receivedby May 1, 1989, in another document published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 14, 1989 (54 FR 14968, Docket Number89-058j). In response to requests for a public hearing on the proposedrule, we published another document in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 19, 1989 (54 FR 21626-21627, Docket Number89-090), that announced a public hearing in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on June6, 1989, and extended the comment period until June 20, 1989.Twenty-one persons spoke at the public hearing, and ninteen of these personsalso submitted written comments by mail. We received a total of 95 writtencomments, of which 6 were solely requests for a public hearing or an extensionof the comment period.Of the 91 commenters with substantive comments, 52 supported the proposedrule and 39 either opposed the rule or requested that changes be made beforepublication of a final rule.Those commenters supporting the proposed rule generally stated their beliefthat the requirements in the rule would be effective in preventing theintroduction of disease associated with swine semen. Many commenters alsostated that the importation of Chinese swine semen would provide benefitsin the form of research opportunities and possibilities for improving domesticbreeds of swine.Those commenters opposed to the rule as proposed frequently addressed fourissues: The risk of disease spread associated with imported semen; theadequacy of quarantine, testing, and other procedures contained in theproposed rule; the reliability of certifications by the official veterinaryorganization (OVO) of the People's Republic of China (PRC); and the relationshipof Chinese swine semen import requirements to live Chinese swine importrequirements.Comments opposing the proposed rule and comments requesting change to theproposed rule are summarized and italicized below, followed by our responseto each. No changes were made to the proposed rule in response to the comments.<T3>The tests specified in the proposed rule may not be adequate to detectdiseases in semen, particularly low-level infections. The full range ofdisease transmission possible through semen is unknown.</T3>The final rule states that aliquots of each ejaculate of semen collectedshall be submitted to the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory(FADDL) for pathogen isolation tests for FMD, brucellosis, swine vesiculardisease (SVD), hog cholera, Japanese encephalitis B, and pseudorabies.The test procedures in use at FADDL are recognized by the internationalscientific community, and extensive assessment of their use at FADDL hasfound them to be accurate. Some specific shortcomings of <T3>in vitro </T3>semen tests, and the procedures in place to compensate,are discussed below. It should be noted that the final rule contains requirementsin addition to testing of the semen itself, i.e., premises and isolationfacility requirements and serologic testing of the donor boars for diseases.Because of the possibility that unknown methods of disease transmissionmay exist, through semen or other means, APHIS import requirements employa variety of diagnostic tools (clinical examination, serologic tests, inoculationand observation of sentinel animals) that reveal disease transmission ifit occurs, even if the precise means of transmission is not understood.<T3>Comment: Physical characteristics of swine semen do not permit in vitrosemen testing procedures comparable to live animal quarantines.</T3>In addition to testing the semen collected, the donor boars are also subjectedto the same serologic tests required for imported live Chinese swine. Thesemen tests are not primarily <T3>in vitro; </T3>instead, they are based on the inoculation of pigs susceptibleto the diseases of concern with raw semen from the donor boars, and observationand testing of the test pigs for signs of disease. The semen tests alonedo not replace the quarantine required for live animals; instead, the testsare used in conjunction with quarantine and observation of the donor boarsin China, serologic tests, and other requirements to reduce the overallrisk of disease transmission through semen to a level comparable to orless than the risk associated with importation of live animals.<T3>Comment: In vitro testing of semen aliquots provided to FADDL wouldnot necessarily detect diseases, due to the cytotoxicity of semen to cellmonolayers, the indeterminate number of blind passages necessary to detectpathogens, the reduction of sensitivity of in vitro tests caused by semenpooling, and the presence of natural antiviral activity in some boars'semen. A requirement for in vivo tests should be added, consisting of breedingfemale swine with the imported semen, quarantining them until they havefarrowed normal litters, and subjecting the sows and their litters to physical,serologic, microbiologic, and pathologic evaluations throughout the quarantine.</T3>We agree that swine semen is cytotoxic for cell culture and that the otherproblems described make the reliability of <T3>in vitro </T3>testing of swine semen questionable. That is why thesemen tests conducted at FADDL rely on the more sensitive procedure ofinoculating susceptible pigs with raw semen from donor boars, followedby observation of the test animals for clinical signs of disease and serologic,microbiologic, and pathologic evaluations of the test animals. Numerousstudies have shown that host animals can become infected and show signsof diseases when infected by an inoculum that was negative by cell culturestandards (Blackwell and Hyde, 1976; Blackwell, 1978; Hyde et al. 1975;McKercher et al. 1987; Mebus, unpublished). We believe that this <T3>in vivo </T3>semen test procedure is effective, and that there is noneed for <T3>in vivo </T3>tests of impregnated sows and their litters. <T3>Comment: The rule should require serologic testing of donor boars inChina for African swine fever (ASF) and Japanese B encephalitis, and serumshould be provided to FADDL for confirmatory tests for all tests performedin China.</T3>The final rule does require hemagglutination inhibition tests for JapaneseB encephalities to be performed in China, in accordance with andSection;92.4(d)(7)(iii)(E). Testing for ASF is not required because the PRC hascertified China to be free of ASF and there are no reports from any sourceof ASF occurring in China. We believe that if ASF occurred in China, itsexistence would quickly become obvious, in view of the nature and virulenceof the disease. The rule requires two rounds of serological testing in China, during and21 days after the end of semen collection. These tests are performed atlaboratories designated by the OVO of the PRC, and use materials providedby FADDL for the FMD types C and Asia tests and the brucellosis and tuberculosistests. The SVD tests are conducted at FADDL. In views of this testing regimeand the other safeguards contained in the rule, we do not believe thata third round of confirmatory testing at FADDL is necessary. <T3>Comment: </T3><T3>APHIS cannot effectively monitor quarantine, testing, and certificationrequirements for the swine in China.</T3>Under the final rule, the isolation and semen collection facility operatesunder the joint supervision of APHIS and PRC veterinarians, who ensurethat the facility is operated in accordance with all requirements of therule. APHIS and PRC veterinarians also supervise collection of the serumsamples used for serologic tests in China and at FADDL, and APHIS veterinariansare responsible for the raw semen aliquots sent to FADDL for tests. Thelaboratories performing the tests in China were designated by the officialveterinary organization of the PRC, the organization responsible for awide variety of certification and enforcement activities related to exportof animals and animal products from China. APHIS monitors foreign governments'veterinary programs in terms of their effectiveness in meeting our importrequirements, and at this time we have no reason to doubt the effectivenessof such programs in the PRC. <T3>Comment: The methods for certifying the PRC free of certain diseases(ASF, rinderpest, Teschen's) are not clear.</T3>One of the requirements of the final rule is that the OVO of the PRC, theorganization responsible for animal disease surveillance and reportingin China, must certify that the PRC is free of ASF, rinderpest, and Teschen'sdisease prior to any importation of Chinese swine semen. The OVO of thePRC has made this certification, based on the records they maintain onthe status of animal diseases in China. It is APHIS policy to rely on thecertifications of official veterinary organizations of foreign countriesregarding the presence of diseases in those countries unless we have evidenceor reports to the contrary, or unless the organization has a history ofmaking certifications which are later proven invalid. Nations have a vital economic interest in ensuring that the certificationsprovided by their OVOs are valid, because the trust placed in these certificationsdirectly affects the extent to which a nation's animals and animal productswill be allowed import into other countries. Based on experience with previouscertifications provided by the OVO of the PRC, we believe that the certificationregarding ASF, rinderpest, and Teschen's disease is reliable. In addition,outbreaks of these diseases are a subject of keen international interestdue to the serious nature of the diseases, and are usually reported extensivelyin government and industry publications. There have been no recent reportsof outbreaks of these diseases in China. <T3>Comment: The proposed requirement that the donor board originate frompremises free from FMD, SVD and hog cholera for 3 years, seems to relyonly on epidemiologic data provided by China and may not reliably ensuredisease freedom of the premises. Without an active disease surveillancemodel and serologic confirmation of signs of disease, these time and distancecriteria are meaningless.</T3> The premises of the donor boars have been certified by the OVO of the PRCto meet the requirements of the final rule. Donor boars were selected bya selection team composed of industry officials. Chinese and USDA officials.evaluated herd records and records of the OVO of the PRC, and physicallyexamined the animals on the premises. The same procedures were used toselect animals for the recent live Chinese swine importation. These officialsfound no evidence of infection on the premises within the time limits ofthe rule, and found no other evidence to contradict the certification ofthe PRC that the premises met the requirements of the rule. <T3>Comment: If semen imported from China did cause an exotic disease outbreak,the costs would be very high, and therefore the risks of importing semenare not justified. </T3>APHIS recognizes that any importation of swine, swine products, and relatedarticles presents some risk of introducing exotic diseases, and also recognizesthat the cost of eradicating outbreaks of certain diseases could be veryhigh. To attempt to eliminate all risks, we would have to ban all importsof swine, swine products, and related articles, and even then some riskwould exist due to smuggling and accidents. APHIS policy is to allow importswhen the risks associated with the imports are reduced to insignificantlevels. We believe the final rule reduces the risks associated with importationof Chinese swine semen to an insignificant level, comparable to the risksassociated with a variety of other imports, including live swine from China,allowed under APHIS regulations. <T3>Comment: The project to import live Chinese swine through HSTAIC issafer and will better meet research needs for Chinese swine genetics. </T3>APHIS is authorized to permit or deny importation requests based on assessmentof the animal disease risk associated with the importations, not basedon assessments of the comparative research values of different importations.We have determined that the importation of swine semen from China wouldnot present a significant risk of introducing disease. <T3>Comment: The proposal should be considered a major rule because ofthe potential costs of a disease outbreak resulting from infected semen.</T3>A rule is considered a ``major rule'' in accordance with Executive Order12291 if the rule is likely to result in an annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, orgeographic regions, or significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. APHIS does not agree that adoption of the proposed rule is likelyto result in any of these effects. These effects could only occur if therequirements of the rule failed to prevent the introduction of a seriousexotic animal disease, and if that disease became established and spreadin the United States. APHIS has carefully designed the requirements ofthe rule to prevent such an occurrence. <T3>Comment: The rule would benefit only a few commercial interests andwould be against the interests of the larger pork production industry.</T3>The rule will allow any importer interested in importing Chinese swinesemen to do so if the importation complies with the requirements of Part92. It is unlikely that there will be many such importations in the nearfuture, due to the difficulty and complexity of making the necessary arrangementsin China to comply with the requirements of Part 92. We believe that theavailability of Chinese swine germplasm for breeding research, and thepossible eventual availability of improved breeds incorporating traitsfrom Chinese swine, are in the interests of the larger pork productionindustry. <T3>Comment: If the semen is used to impregnate sows in the U.S., the sowsand their litters should be subject to quarantine safeguards.</T3>APHIS believes that imported Chinese swine semen that has satisfied allthe requirements of Part 92 doesn't present a significant risk of speadinganimal disease, and therefore we have no grounds for imposing further restrictionson sows impregnated with the semen or their litters. <T3>Comment: Unlike the live swine imported from China, there is no 120-dayU.S. quarantine for Chinese swine semen donors or recipients. If 60 daysquarantine in China is sufficient for swine semen donors, why quarantinelive swine for 60 days in China then 120 days in the U.S.?</T3>Live swine require a longer quarantine period because live swine presentmore possibilities for becoming infected and spreading disease than semendoes. Once semen is collected, there is almost no possibility that it willbecome infected; if it is infected, there is almost no possibility thatit will spread the disease unless it is used for artificial insemination.It is possible that live swine could show no symptoms, but be infectedand capable of spreading diseases. We also note that extreme caution was exercised in setting requirementsfor the first importation of live Chinese swine, due to the novelty ofthe project and the disease risks associated with it. It is possible thatthe total quarantine time required for future importations of live Chineseswine, if any, may be reduced based on evaluation of the experience gainedthrough the first importation project. <T3>Comment: It is premature to import China semen before the potentialbenefits and costs of Chinese genetics have been evaluated, e.g., by resultsfrom research on imported live Chinese swine.</T3>APHIS is authorized to permit or deny importation of animals and animalproducts based on risk of spreading animal diseases, not based on the potentialbenefits of cross-breeding projects using imported animals or semen. Researchresults and the marketplace will ultimately determine the uses to whichimported Chinese swine and swine semen will be applied. <T3>Comment: The rule should require inclusion of an antibacterial agentin the semen extender, and lavaging of the prepuce of each donor boar witha broad spectrum antibacterial preparation prior to semen collection.</T3>This comment seems to address prevention of bacterial contamination ofthe collected semen. We agree that this is a valid concern, and the tworecommendations made represent two of the many approaches commonly usedby industry during semen collection to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination.We did not address this issue in the proposed rule because many effectiveprocedures exist to prevent bacterial contamination, and the use of oneor several of them is normal practice during semen collection. The collectionprocedure for the first semen shipment scheduled for import under thisrule, for example, utilizes an antibacterial agent in the semen extenderand filtration of the semen during collection to exclude particles to whichbacterial colonies may adhere. We do not believe it is necessary to specify particular procedures to avoidbacterial contamination of collected semen, in view of normal industrypractices to prevent such contamination, and in view of the fact that thesemen test requirements would reveal such contamination if it occurs. <T3>Comment: Semen collection should not be allowed until 14 days afterthe second dihydrostreptomycin injection to prevent the possible transmissionof bacterial diseases, especially Leptospirosis. </T3>If any donor boars are infected with bacterial diseases transmissible throughsemen, such as Leptospirosis, the <T3>in vivo </T3>semen tests performed at FADDL should reveal the infection.We do not wish to postpone semen collection until after the second dihydrostreptomycininjection because of the possibility that the antibiotics could reducethe level of bacteria in semen to a level that, while still theoreticallycapable of infecting inseminated animals, might escape detection throughthe tests at FADDL. <T3>Comment: Prior to implementing the final rule, APHIS should arrangea meeting of animal health experts to form a consensus on the technicalrequirements necessary to safely import swine semen from China. </T3>USDA animal health experts designed the technical requirements containedin the final rule, which was published for comment. The public hearingalso provided a forum for comments on the technical requirements. The viewsof interested parties, including many technically qualified commentersfrom outside USDA, have been taken into account in developing this finalrule. We do not believe there are significant technical issues that havenot been raised during this process, and see no need for a special meetingof animal health experts. <T3>Comment: This rule sets a precedent for importing semen from countrieswith devastating diseases. What is USDA's objective?</T3>One of the basic legislative mandates of APHIS is to regulate the importationof animals and animal products to prevent the introduction or disseminationof contagious, infectious, or communicable disease of animals into theUnited States. The objective of APHIS is to prohibit importations thatcould result in such introduction or dissemination of disease, and to allowimportations, in accordance with specified procedures and safeguards, thatdo not pose a significant risk of introducing animal disease. This is thesame basic policy that guides all APHIS activities in the area of animaland animal products importation. When APHIS receives a request to importan animal product from a country, such as swine semen from China, we determinewhether and under what conditions the requested importation can be allowed,based on our legislative mandate and assessment of the risks involved.This is the same process that has been followed in the past to allow thesafe importation, under appropriate restrictions, of animals and animalproducts from a number of countries where serious animal diseases occur,e.g., FMD and rinderpest. This rule does not set a precedent for allowinga higher level of risk in importations than was previously accepted.This rule does mark the first time swine semen has been imported from acountry where FMD or rinderpest may occur. However, the basic regulationsallowing such importations to occur have existed in 9 CFR Part 92 since1966. The objective of APHIS now is the same as it was when those regulationswere enacted; to allow such importations to proceed if they can be accomplishedwithout significant risk of disease introduction or dissemination.<T3>Comment: APHIS should have informed the Agricultural Research Service(ARS), Iowa State University, and the University of Illinois about theproposed importation of semen earlier, so they could consider whether tocommit money and resources to the importation of live swine. Participantsin the live swine importation were under the impression that the live swinewould be the only source of Chinese swine germplasm for research in theU.S. for at least several years.</T3>In September, 1988, APHIS was first informed by PRC officials that thePRC would cooperate in developing and implementing procedures for the safeimportation into the United States of Chinese swine semen. By this date,the major arrangements, protocols, and funding agreements for the importationof live Chinese swine had already been completed. APHIS informed ARS ofthe possibility of swine semen importation soon after the PRC indicatedtheir willingness to cooperate on such projects. In December, 1988, a companyfiled with APHIS an application to import Chinese swine semen. On March28, 1989, after determining that safe importation of Chinese swine semenseemed possible, we published a proposed rule on the subject in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 12639-12642, Docket No. 89-021). Thisrule provided public notice of our proposed requirements for importationof Chinese swine semen.Our regulations are established pursuant to animal quarantine and relatedlaws which generally provide authority to take action to prevent the introductionof certain animal diseases. These statutory provisions do not provide authorityfor establishing prohibitions in order to establish or guarantee accessto imported animals or animal products for one group and not another. Theposition of APHIS has always been that importation of swine or swine productsfrom China could be allowed whenever the importer and the exporting countryarranged to meet regulatory requirements to ensure that the importationwas safe.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date</ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, we find good cause for makingthis rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Arrangements for the quarantine of Chinese swineand semen collection have already been completed by the importer, USDA,and the People's Republic of China. Any further delay would be unnecessaryand would disrupt research schedules and unnecessarily increase the costfor importers. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this final rule should be effectiveupon signature.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the the economy of less than $100 million; will not causea major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographic regions; andwill not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.International trade in porcine semen is a very small business. During recentyears, porcine semen imported into the United States has consisted of theejaculates of no more than two dozen swine a year. Porcine semen importedfrom China in accordance with this rule will amount to a considerable percentageof the porcine semen imported in 1989, since the one company currentlyengaged in importations of this type plans to import ejaculates of approximately16 Chinese boars. It is anticipated that very few additional Chinese porcinesemen importation requests will occur in the near future. The ratio ofChinese swine semen imported to total swine semen imported will vary dependingon the number and types of requests received for permits to import swinesemen in future years.The semen imported in accordance with this rule will be used in breedingresearch projects and will have no effects on the U.S. swine industry inthe near future.Importation of Chinese porcine semen may eventually help to improve UnitedStates breeds of swine, by its role in developing breeds with increasedlitter size and other desirable attributes known to be present in Chineseswine breeds.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The regulations in this rule contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq</T3>.).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.

Any otherswine at the isolation facility, such as teaser animals, must also meetthe requirements of this paragraph. No animals may be added to the groupafter the start of the 60-day isolation/collection period. The Departmentwill permit collection of semen to be initiated at the beginning of theisolation/collection period. The facility shall be cleaned and disinfectedwith a 4 percent sodium carbonate solution used in accordance with applicablelabel instructions in the presence of OVO quarantine personnel prior tothe start of the isolation. During the isolation/collection period, personnelhandling the animals shall not have contact with other domestic farm livestock(this term does not include pets such as dogs and cats). Raw animal foodwastes (garbage) shall not be fed to the donor boars while in isolation.At the start of the isolation/collection period, and again after 14 daysof isolation, all animals offered for collection of semen must be givenan intramuscular injection of dihydrostreptomycin at a rate of 25 mg/kgdosage as a precautionary treatment for leptospirosis. Feed and beddingused during the isolation/collection period shall not originate from areasinfected with epizootic diseases and must meet veterinary hygienic requirementsestablished by the OVO of the PRC concerning freedom of the feed and beddingfrom contamination that could transmit diseases. During the isolation/collectionperiod the swine at the collection center shall not have direct contactwith, or exposure to, any other animals not included in the group at theisolation facility. Exposure consists of contact with yards, pens, or otherfacilities or vehicles that have been in contact with animals and havenot been cleaned and disinfected.
