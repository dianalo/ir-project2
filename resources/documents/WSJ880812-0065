Chairman Roger Smith that Hughes Aircraft Corp. wouldn't appeal the awarding of a $3.6 billion contract to International Business Machines Corp.    But three or four days later, Mr. Burnley said, &quot;the protest came in&quot; from Hughes, a GM unit, which had lost out to IBM in bidding for the contract to provide air-traffic control equipment to the Federal Aviation Administration.    Mr. Burnley told reporters that he got a phone call from Mr. Smith shortly after the contract was awarded two weeks ago. The GM chairman told Mr. Burnley that Hughes wouldn't protest the decision, and that it planned to turn over its research and development data to IBM because it was in the national interest, according to the secretary.    &quot;I congratulated him on his citizenship,&quot; Mr. Burnley recalled. He said he was subsequently &quot;disappointed but not surprised&quot; when Hughes filed a protest with the General Services Administration's Board of Contract Appeals.    GM spokesman said yesterday Mr. Smith was on vacation and couldn't be reached to comment on Mr. Burnley's remarks. A spokesman for Hughes referred questions to GM headquarters in Detroit.    The appeals board on Wednesday suspended the contract while it considers the merits of Hughes's case. A hearing on the merits is scheduled for Sept. 9. </TEXT></DOC>
