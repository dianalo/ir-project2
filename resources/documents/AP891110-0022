Foley about plansfor a 33 percent congressional pay hike and his response reflectsthe barrage of semantics that is a key part of many lawmakers'strategy.   ``Are you talking about the ethics package?'' he says.   And the initial 7.7 percent raise members would receive on Jan.1 is a ``cost-of-living adjustment, not a pay raise,'' he says.``If you are talking about a pay adjustment, no one is proposing todo that in this Congress.''   Ten months after public uproar drove lawmakers to kill aproposed 51 percent salary increase for Congress, the judiciary andtop executive branch jobs, House leaders are charging ahead with anew mix of semantics and timing, public policy and financialself-interest.   House members would within 14 months see their salaries risefrom $89,500 to more than $120,000. The initial pay boost is billedas a cost-of-living adjustment to make up for two years ofinflation without an increase.   The bulk of the raise, a 25 percent boost, would be delayeduntil Jan. 1, 1991, after the next Congress is elected. At thattime, lawmakers would be banned from keeping money from speechesbefore interest groups.   It was James Madison who suggested that the Constitution barlawmakers from approving pay increases to take effect in the sameCongress.   ``This is not the same old saw,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.,who along with Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., led a bipartisan panelthat fashioned the plan.   Other ethics reforms would include requiring members to disclosemore about their personal finances and new restrictions on thegifts they could receive. Final details of the package were beingnegotiated this week between Republicans and Democrats in the Houseand Senate, and with the White House.   The new proposal also would be handled in a more straightforwardway than earlier this year, when former House Speaker Jim Wrighttried to force the 51 percent pay hike into effect without a vote.On this one, members will be forced to record their views.   ``Clearly the package that's before us now is substantiallybetter,'' said Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa, a leader of the effort todefeat the earlier proposal.   Tauke said he would not actively oppose the new plan, but hewouldn't vote for it. Among his reasons is the inclusion of the payincrease starting in January.   ``It is very difficult, I think, to explain to people back homethat a cost of living adjustment is not a pay raise,'' said Tauke,who is running for the Senate.   Tauke and others said it was bad timing for Congress to considera pay raise before it has taken steps to correct massive budgetaryproblems.   The failure to enact a deficit-reduction bill this year hasrequired the Bush administration, under the Gramm-Rudman law, toorder across-the-board spending cuts. The Pentagon said this weekit could be forced to reduce U.S. troop strength by tens ofthousands.   Foley on Thursday said he was willing to put forward thepay-and-ethics plan before a fiscal settlement, but others saidthat would be a mistake.   ``There is no question in my mind (that) if we cannot eliminatethe across-the-board cuts, there is no chance members are going tovote for a pay raise,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman LeonPanetta, D-Calif., who is working to complete the deficit bill.   Rep. Jim Chapman, D-Texas, said many members, including himself,would be very cautious about voting for a pay raise. ``I don'tthink there's anything about this thing that's popular,'' he said.   President Bush has indicated a willingness to accept a raise,since he badly wants to increase salaries for federal judges andhis top political appointees in the administration.   Senators, however, have little desire to risk anything for a payboost. They generally have more personal wealth than their Housecolleagues and their rules let them keep honoraria equal to 40percent of their salaries, compared to 30 percent in the House _and senators have a much easier time lining up speeches.   ``There's not a lot of support in the Senate for a pay raise,''Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Thursday.   House and Senate leaders have discussed the possibility that theSenate might accept the initial 7.7 percent raise but, for its ownmembers, eschew the later installment.   On board or not, members are getting the message.   ``It's an ethics package. It's not a pay raise,'' quipped Rep.Jack Buechner, R-Mo., when he was asked for a stance. ``If youcan't get the jargon down...''</TEXT></DOC>
