Before you say &quot;Thank you very much but I already knew that,&quot; look at what's playing on Broadway: novels by Mark Twain, Victor Hugo and Choderlos de Laclos. And look at off-Broadway: the American Theater Exchange's four-play sampler of regional theater includes two novel-adaptations.    The first, recently concluded at Theatre 890, was the Berkeley Repertory Theatre's production of Stephen Jeffreys's adaptation of Charles Dickens's &quot;Hard Times.&quot; The second, running through this week at the Joyce, is the Wilma Theater's production of Pavel Kohout's adaptation of George Orwell's &quot;1984.&quot; Novel-staging seems an increasingly popular way for theaters to get around what Hollywood likes to call the &quot;product shortage.&quot;    As it happens, these productions of &quot;Hard Times&quot; and &quot;1984&quot; represent dramatically opposed ways of approaching the job. The Dickens work is an intentionally modest chamber work for five actors, several musical instruments (played by one of the actors when he's not in character), and little else. There were a few small props and a bit of scenery scattered around the makeshift playing space, but there might as well not have been.    &quot;1984,&quot; by contrast, is a technological extravaganza: Films and slides are projected at the drop of a hat; eerie recorded sound effects and frequent lighting shifts punctuate the action regularly; and an assortment of beds, desks, chairs and other contraptions moves on and off the scene frequently.    It might, at first glance, seem obvious that the works themselves dictate such dissimilar approaches. But in fact, Richard E.T. White, the director of the Dickens, would have been perfectly justified in attempting complex feats with stage machinery, since the novel details the brutalizing effects of industrialization on the landscape and the soul. And Jiri Zizka, the director of the Orwell, might well have chosen to evoke the deadening grip of tyranny with great emptiness instead of with great clutter. There was nothing preordained about the decision to use minimal means with &quot;Hard Times&quot; and maximal with &quot;1984.&quot;    That neither production succeeds as theater has less to do with the specifics of the stagings than with the complete failure to understand why and how a novel can make the transition into the theater. The first question that needs to be asked -- and in both of these cases, it seems not to have been -- is: Why bother? What can the stage supply that is missing from the original work? In the case of &quot;Big River&quot; and &quot;Les Miserables,&quot; the answer, clearly, is music; and whatever your assessment of the results, neither of these productions can be experienced as novels on the stage -- they exist independent of the books, as theater.    Since turning &quot;Hard Times&quot; or &quot;1984&quot; into a musical would be silly -- though who's to say it won't be attempted one of these days? -- we must ask not only what these novels stand to gain by moving from page to stage, but also what theater stands to gain. When the Royal Shakespeare Company adapted another Dickens novel, &quot;Nicholas Nickleby,&quot; it became the occasion for a celebration of theater's narrative power. The show's vastness, its intricate plot, its dozens of characters and myriad stage effects gave the company an opportunity to pull out all the theatrical stops, and, in the end, &quot;Nickleby&quot; succeeded not as another version of Dickens, which after all, the world does not need, but as a theatrical tour de force. The theatrical reasoning behind &quot;Hard Times&quot; seems almost perverse: Let's see how little we can do, short of reading the book aloud.    It isn't that this staged &quot;Hard Times&quot; was so terrible. For the most part, the actors carried off their multiple roles; the story took shape; our sympathies were engaged. Yet nothing particularly stage-worthy seemed to be happening. The play just plodded along, laying out Dickens's cautionary tale of how utilitarian philosophy -- whether applied to child-rearing, business, or romance -- leads its practitioners astray. Utilitarianism, 19th-century shorthand for &quot;the end justifies the means,&quot; is still alive and well, Dickens's critique notwithstanding. So the lessons of &quot;Hard Times&quot; are not inappropriate in these days of insider-trading scandals, arms-sales scandals, name-your-own-favorite scandals. And this production still failed to justify itself. All through its three-plus hours, I kept wondering why, why, why should I be in the theater watching it when I could have been at home reading it? The answer never came.    Nor did it come at &quot;1984.&quot; Here, there are problems quite separate from that basic question. The acting in this production seems uniformly off-key. Speeches that should ring with pain or passion are oddly flat. Conversations between two characters appear to be taking place on different planets. It's possible that this is a deliberate attempt to convey the effect of Newspeak on the emotional content of speech -- an utterly self-defeating tactic in a theater. It may also be that Mr. Zizka, for whom English is a second language, has little ear for spoken English. Whatever the explanation, the peculiar line-readings doom this production from the start.    Moreover, all the electronic gimcrackery looks chintzy. The pervasiveness of Big Brother is conveyed by flashing his image over and over again on the same screens. The tortures of Room 101 are administered while the protagonist Winston is strapped to a rolling lounge chair with a snap-up footrest that kept refusing to snap up the night I saw the play. Despite the multimedia trappings, this &quot;1984&quot; remains too hopelessly literal to be scary -- the nightmarish future is reduced to clunky contraptions and flashing lights.    But even if the acting were first-rate and the special effects dazzling, we would still wonder why anyone felt the need to put this work on stage. Like &quot;Hard Times,&quot; &quot;1984&quot; is a cautionary tale, the cautions of which are still very apt. But what does the theater do for them? There's a good argument to be made that putting a face on Big Brother -- any face -- diminishes him. In the book, the revulsion we feel is Winston Smith's revulsion. On the stage, Winston cowers in one corner while Big Brother's face glowers from another -- we have no reason to share Winston's hatred, and we have none of our own. Orwell's powerful fable fizzles.    The Wilma, based in Philadelphia, prides itself on presenting an adaptation of a novel at least once a year. Perhaps a famous novel confers instant legitimacy on the season's other offerings; perhaps it sells lots of subscriptions; perhaps it's just easier to commission an adaptation than a new work. Whatever the case, one fact remains: A novel is not a play. Anyone who disagrees will have a very, very hard time proving it on the stage. </TEXT></DOC>
