Gottschalk Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FIN SCR </IN><TEXT>   Seventy years old and confined to a wheelchair, Gus Hoehn should have been retired by now.    But the Pasadena, Calif., dermatologist has to keep working part-time because he didn't take the proper precautions when he put his trust in an investment adviser.    The adviser, Steven H. Henry, is currently serving a 10-year-sentence in state prison after pleading no contest to charges he stole $4.5 million from Dr. Hoehn and other clients between May 1982 and July 1986. Instead of investing the money for his clients, the Los Angeles district attorney says, Mr. Henry frittered it away on a &quot;Rolls-Royce&quot; life style that included four homes, a 33-foot yacht and shopping trips to Europe.    Says Dr. Hoehn: &quot;He not only stole from me, he stole from my heirs.&quot;    Money-management scams are proliferating. &quot;The financial marketplace has become so complicated that it's hard to make decisions, and people turn over {the responsibility} to someone else,&quot; says William McDonald, chief of enforcement for the California Department of Corporations. Too often, it's the wrong &quot;someone else.&quot;    It doesn't have to be that way, however. Investors can minimize the danger of being ripped off by financial planners, investment advisers and money managers if they take the right steps.    The simplest advice, of course, is just to never give a financial adviser authority to invest money without your approval of each transaction. &quot;Con men work very hard to get discretionary power over an investor's funds,&quot; says Barbara Roper, financial planning specialist at the Consumer Federation of America. &quot;They usually draw up a plan with reasonable advice, and then suggest that the individual doesn't want the hassle of handling this himself.&quot;    That's how 50 Florida doctors allegedly lost $25 million to financial planner Henry Gherman. Mr. Gherman fled the country last summer, leaving each of the doctors with only a handwritten note: &quot;Dear Client,&quot; it began. &quot;By the time you have received this I will be gone. I have run away.&quot;    But while never allowing an adviser to buy and sell without specific permission can protect investors from con artists, it will also shut investors off from legitimate money managers. For those who do want to use a money manager, state securities regulators and attorneys who specialize in fraud cases make the following suggestions:   ESTABLISH SEPARATE CUSTODY: Investors don't need to give money managers total control of their funds to allow them to make investment decisions. Instead, a bank can hold the investments in a custodial account in the client's name. That way, a money manager can buy and sell without having to seek specific approval of each transaction, but the manager can't appropriate the funds for his or her own use.    LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTS: Several recent swindles could have been prevented if investors had only asked to see source documents for the investments their money managers claimed to be making -- things like certificates of deposit, stock and bond certificates and mutual-fund confirmation statements.    Dr. Hoehn, the Pasadena dermatologist, says jailed investment adviser Steven Henry claimed he was taking out a special high-interest $2 million CD, of which Dr. Hoehn would be part-owner. But Dr. Hoehn never saw the original CD -- only monthly letters from Mr. Henry purporting to show the CD number, the amount, the date due and Dr. Hoehn's share. In reality, there was no jumbo CD; and Dr. Hoehn says he had a loss of $500,000.    Mr. McDonald suggests that investors demand that their advisers send them original documents; at the least, there should be periodic meetings with the advisers at which they see the original documents. Investors should also spot-check banks and financial-services firms to see that money managers have actually bought the CDs, money-market funds and mutual funds they claim to have purchased and that they are in the investor's name.    SPREAD IT AROUND: The Miami victims of Mr. Gherman had their personal investments, corporate investments, life insurance, stock brokerage investments, pension investments and money market funds with him. As a result, many have been wiped out. If they had spread their investments around among several managers and advisers, they would have had something left.    WATCH FOR THE COMMERCIAL: Attend free seminars for education only, and be wary of free follow-up meetings with financial planners: They are often sales sessions for specific products.    Robert Kowtowsky, a retired Barrington, Ill., plant manager, rues the day that he and his wife attended free financial planning seminars held by Financial Concepts Inc. of Barrington. After meeting later with financial planners, the Kowtowskys bought $180,000 of real estate partnerships.    The partnerships have since gotten into trouble, Mr. Kowtowsky says, and he and his wife are faced with losses of as much as two-thirds of their money. &quot;You don't get anything for free in the investment world,&quot; Mr. Kowtowksy says. Financial Concepts has been shut down by the state, says Richard Schultz, senior enforcement attorney for the Illinois Securities Department.    DO A BACKGROUND CHECK: If Mr. Kowtowsky had contacted the Illinois Securities Department, Mr. Schultz says he would have discovered that the founders of Financial Concepts didn't have licenses to sell securities in Illinois. He also would have found that the department had actions against them in 1982 and 1983 for violating state securities laws.    Similarly, Richard L. Allen, a Miami attorney representing victims of the Gherman swindle, says a phone call would have disclosed that Mr. Gherman wasn't registered with the Florida Department of Securities.    The Securities and Exchange Commission is another source of information. While there are 200,000 people in the U.S. who say they are financial planners, there are only 13,000 investment advisory firms registered with the SEC to sell securities.    Finally, checking an adviser's track record can do more than give you an idea whether the person is a good investment manager. &quot;Most con artists move around a lot,&quot; says Ms. Roper of the Consumer Federation. &quot;They have a limited amount of time to pull off their swindle. There's a point at which their scheme falls apart.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
