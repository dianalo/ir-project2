But experts remain puzzled by the actual workings of sucha weapon, which would be five times larger than any known gunin the arsenal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization orthe Warsaw Pact. Iraqi officials insist that thecontroversial piping is intended for a petrochemical project,and Sheffield Forgemasters, the British manufacturer of thetubes, said it wasn't aware of the material's allegedmilitary use when it took the order.</LP><TEXT>   In the first high-level acknowledgment of the pipes'military potential, Trade and Industry Secretary NicholasRidley told the House of Commons that the eight steel tubeswere &quot;consistent&quot; with designs by murdered international armsdealer and weapons designer Gerald Bull. Because of that, thetrade secretary added, he was now &quot;entirely satisfied&quot; thatthe pipes were part of a gun.   Mr. Bull, a Canadian-born American regarded by armsexperts as a ballistics genius, was shot to death outside hisBrussels apartment March 22, apparently in a professionalhit. Sheffield Forgemasters said Mr. Bull's Brussels-basedcompany, Space Research Corp., had acted for the IraqiMinistry of Trade in arranging the contract for the pipes andprovided technical drawings for the production of the parts.   &quot;If it wasn't for the involvement of Gerald Bull, onewould have dismissed out of hand the possibility that thesetubes could be gun parts,&quot; said Michael Dewar, deputydirector of the International Institute for Strategic Studiesin London.   Experts believe that the 132-feet-long pipes, which have abore of almost 40 inches, could be pieced together to formthe barrel of a gun capable of lobbing chemical or nuclearshells several hundred miles. There has even been speculationthat the powerful weapon could boost satellites into earthorbit.   Though huge guns were developed by the British and Germansin World War II, they proved inaccurate and unwieldy. Expertssay Mr. Bull's research on shells that shed part of theirbulk and weight after firing and his work on in-flightboosters might have made such a weapon feasible. &quot;But we hereat the institute don't know how such a weapon would work, andI don't think anyone else does either,&quot; said Mr. Dewar. Otherstrategic and armament experts in the United Kingdom agreed.   The steel tubes, seized last Thursday at a port innortheastern England, were the last of a 52-pipe order; theother 44 were shipped to Iraq's Ministry of Industry andMinerals. But British trade secretary Ridley said Iraq can'tcomplete the weapon without the seized pipes. &quot;Let me make itabsolutely clear that the gun itself cannot be in operationswithout all its parts,&quot; he told the Commons, &quot;and it is agreat success on the behalf of this country to have been ableto prevent that happening.&quot;   Mr. Ridley said his department had received a request in1988 from Forgemasters asking if permits were needed toexport tubes to Iraq for use in the petrochemical industry. ABirmingham company, Walter Somers Ltd., also queried thegovernment about an Iraqi order for specialized pipelineequipment.   &quot;Until a few days ago, my department had no knowledge thatthe goods were designed to form part of a gun,&quot; Mr. Ridleysaid. &quot;If my department had known that purpose, they would,of course, have advised that licenses were necessary, andthey would not have been granted.&quot;   Walter Somers, a subsidiary of Eagle Trust PLC, said itmay have been duped by the Iraqis into producing gun parts.The hydraulic equipment was shipped to Iraq in October andcould have been part of a giant shock absorber, or recoilmechanism, for a weapon.   The company also received an urgent order earlier thismonth to make a &quot;positioning or aiming&quot; mechanism that&quot;allows for a very substantial pipe-like device to be swungthrough a 60-degree angle,&quot; according to Eagle Trust ChairmanDavid James. He added that &quot;none of us have ever heard of anoil pipe which requires a lateral movement of 60 degrees.&quot;The company told the Iraqis it didn't have the capacity tobuild the device and shared its suspicions with the BritishDepartment of Trade and Industry.   There have also been reports that Iraq contacted a Belgiandefense company, PRB, to help produce a shell for the allegedgun. PRB is owned by British munitions company Astra HoldingsPLC.   The gun controversy has worsened the already-strainedrelations between Britain and Iraq. Last month, the Iraqishanged a London-based journalist whom they accused of spying.In March, British customs seized parts for nuclear-bombtriggers, bound for Iraq, and arrested five people. One wasdeported, one released, and three await trial.   Asked about the latest allegations on Wednesday, Iraq'sdeputy foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoon, pointed out in atelephone interview from Baghdad that his country already haslong-range missiles and a powerful air force and has recentlylaunched a space rocket. &quot;What's the need for that gun?&quot; heasked.   He also termed &quot;ridiculous&quot; the speculation of armsexperts that such a gun could launch satellites.</TEXT></DOC>
