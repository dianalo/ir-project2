STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   West German computer hackers havestolen data that provides access to key military and researchcomputers in the West and passed that information to the Soviets,officials and news reports said.   A West German television network on Thursday said passwords,codes and other information came from computers in the UnitedStates, Western Europe and Japan. West Germany prosecutors saidthree people were arrested, and a TV network said at least 10computer hackers were involved in the spy ring.   The Norddeutsche Rundfunk broadcasting network said among thecomputers was the U.S. Defense Department's general databank, knownas Optimus; a NASA and a ``Star Wars'' research computer; andcomputers tied to nuclear weapons and energy research at the LosAlamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Fermi NationalAccelerator Laboratory in Illinois.   The network said attempts were made to gain access to theLawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California, whichit called a key link in efforts to break into other U.S. computers.   Clifford Stoll, an astrophysicist who did research at thelaboratory, said up to 50 military computers were broken intothrough an astronomy computer, but that the hacker did not havepasswords for classified information.   ``We were amazed! Here's some guy breaking into an astronomycomputer in Berkeley, reaching out into military computers trying tosearch for information about SDI (the Strategic Defense Initiative,known as ``Star Wars''), about nuclear warheads,'' Stoll said in atelephone interview Thursday from his home in Cambridge, Mass.   Stoll, who works at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory atHarvard University, said he and other researchers helped break thespy ring by providing false information. He said someone linked toEast bloc groups wrote the laboratory asking for relatedinformation, leading authorities to crack the ring. He did notelaborate.   Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's Officein Karlsruhe, said police in Hanover arrested two computer hackerson ``suspicion of espionage activities for an eastern Europeanintelligence agency.'' Another suspect was arrested in West Berlin,he said.   ``They are suspected of breaking into foreign computer systems''and selling information to communist agents, Prechtel said.   He said investigators are trying to assess how much damage wascaused to Western security interests.   Roland Bachmeier, spokesman for the federal Interior Ministry,said information was provided to Soviet intelligence agents.   The officials declined to elaborate.   In Hamburg today, West Germany's best-known club for computerhackers said that in autumn 1987, it warned federal officials aboutthe vulnerability of international computer systems. However, ChaosComputer Club president Wau Holland said federal officials ``did nottake the opportunity for a talk.''   Norddeutsche Rundfunk said that at the bidding of Soviet agents,the computer hackers gained access to a U.S. Defense Departmentcomputer and important research and business computers elsewhere.   The hackers obtained sensitive information that would allow theSoviets themselves to gain access to the computers and developtechnology based on the information, the network said.   The information would also give the Kremlin access to U.S.military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging toseveral European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospaceresearch, the network said.   ``Thousands of computer codes, passwords and programs weredelivered to the Soviets,'' the network said. ``They opened the doorfor the KGB to gain access to some of the most important computercenters of the Western world.''   William Bardeen, head of the theory group at Fermilab in Batavia,said Soviets participate in research there. ``So there are Sovietscientists living at Fermilab and using the computers. There isn'tanything confidential or strategic in the computers.''   Jeff Schwartz, spokesman for Los Alamos National Laboratory, saidhe knew of no evidence that a foreign intelligence agency had gainedaccess to its classified computer system.   Norddeutsche Runkfunk said the three suspects were detainedfollowing searches of at least six apartments in West Berlin andHanover.   ZDF television said the three suspects ``belonged to a hardcoreof 10 hackers.''   According to Norddeutsche Rundfunk, authorities believe the threeWest German hackers were recruited by the KGB, the Sovietintelligence agency, in 1985 and ``were paid with cash and drugs ...and were later forced to provide the codes and passwords to theSoviets.''   The network said the trio handed over information from the UnitedStates, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland and West Germanyat a 1985 meeting with two KGB agents in East Berlin.   In Tokyo, a laboratory official said today that unknown WestGerman hackers broke into a computer system in a Japanese governmentresearch laboratory in 1985.   The National Laboratory For High Energy Physics discovered that aresearch project was penetrated in mid-1985, laboratory spokesmanShinichi Watanabe said. He said no sensitive information was stolen,and the laboratory has since heightened security by changingpasswords and other measures.   He said it was not known if the intruders were part of thealleged spy ring in West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
