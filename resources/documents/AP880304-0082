Sri Lankan military officials said four Tamil rebels were killedThursday in a shootout with Indian troops in a village near thenorthern town of Jaffna.   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,said the rebels were killed after they attacked an Indian patrol.They said one Indian soldier was badly wounded.   India has about 45,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka to enforce anIndian-sponsored peace accord signed last July to end the Tamilrebels' four-year separatist insurrection.   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest of the rebelgroups, has rejected the accord. The Tigers have been the focus ofIndian search operations in and around Batticaloa, a town 140 milesnortheast of Colombo.   Protest marches were called for in Batticaloa by the EelamRevolutionary Organization of Students, which has endorsed thepeace accord but alleges Sri Lankan soldiers are violating itthrough shootings and arrests. Under the accord, the Sri Lankanarmy is to be confined to barracks.   In telephone interviews, Batticaloa residents said that Indiantroops drove through the town warning civilians they would be shotif they violated orders prohibiting public gatherings.   The residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said noincidents were reported.   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's16 million population. They claim they are discriminated against bythe island's majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control thegovernment and military.   The peace accord signed July 29 calls on the Tamils to lay downtheir arms in exchange for more political autonomy in the northernand eastern regions where they live.   India has become involved because it has about 60 million ethnicTamils in its southern states who are sympathetic to their SriLankan brethern.</TEXT></DOC>
