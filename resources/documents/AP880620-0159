Total disappearance of tobacco in 1987-88 probably will be upabout 3 percent from last season, the department's EconomicResearch Service said in its new outlook analysis.   As a result, stockpiles of unmanufactured tobacco leaf may bedown 13 percent from last year's 3.33 billion pounds. The newmarketing year for flue-cured begins July 1, while the year forburley and other kinds will start Oct. 1.   ``Domestic leaf disappearance is increasing largely because U.S.cigarette production is rising,'' the report said. ``Thisproduction increase is the result of big gains in cigaretteexports; domestic cigarette consumption is declining.''</TEXT></DOC>
