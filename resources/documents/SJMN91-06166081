Her time was spent fillingvolumes of notebooks and learning to play guitar.;    In 1989, she released&quot;Old Wives' Tales,&quot; a melancholy collection of acoustic country folk, cocktailjazz and spoken-word pieces. Last year, she released &quot;Running Sacred,&quot; analbum of sophisticated, politically charged folk-rock that picked upthematically where X left off. This year, she spent five weeks touring withformer Dream Syndicate member Steve Wynn.;    In a brief phone conversationthis week, Cervenka, 35, talked about her return to Los Angeles and therebirth of X. Saturday at 8 p.m., she'll be in San Francisco at the Noe ValleyMinistry, 1021 Sanchez St., for her first Bay Area poetry reading in sixyears.;    Cervenka seems rankled by the intense interest in the re-formationof X, a band she had previously characterized as having run its creativecourse. &quot;There never was a break-up. Never a consensus one way or another. Wedid the solo projects, but we're together now. And we're about to sign with aPolygram subsidiary and make a record soon,&quot; Cervenka said.;    &quot;Every timesomeone asks what's going on with X, I give a different answer. We could belike the Dead and perform for 25 years or we could never play together again.There never was any big plan and we never made a big production over goingseparate ways.&quot;;    After the release of the last X album, &quot;Live at theWhiskey a Go-Go,&quot; in '88, Cervenka's ex-husband and co-songwriter, John Doe,released a solo album, &quot;Meet John Doe,&quot; and was cast in the Jerry Lee Lewisfilm biography &quot;Great Balls of Fire.&quot; Doe and Cervenka, who remained on goodworking terms after their marital split, are writing together for the firsttime since '87. X guitarist Tony Gilkyson produced both of Cervenka's albums.Gilkyson and drummer D.J. Bonebrake worked in Cervenka's touring band.;   L.A. woman;    Cervenka's love/hate relationship with Los Angeles began in '76when she was an unemployed 20-year-old from Tallahassee, Fla., searching for abetter life in the big city. Cervenka often has used the city and its seamierdenizens as metaphors in her work. Her return to Los Angeles (with herhusband, actor/poet Viggo Mortenson, and their 3-year-old son, Henry) is bothtemporary and pragmatic.;    &quot;Now, I like it when I'm here because I know Idon't have to stay,&quot; Cervenka said. &quot;My friends all live here. I don't reallyhave a lot of friends in Idaho. When I have to work, it's in L.A.&quot; You have tomake a living. I think if I didn't have to do all these things, I'd spend allmy time working on my songs and taking care of my son.&quot;;    Cervenka said shedidn't miss the stimulation of the urban experience during the long wintermonths in Sand Point, a tiny community in the Idaho panhandle.;    &quot;There's anincredible freedom of thought that comes from not being besieged withdistractions. When the phone rings there, it's someone you want to talk to,you know?&quot;;    Although Cervenka's solo works are heavily influenced by theold-line folk themes and styles she and Doe tentatively explored with X, shesaid there is no folk tradition as such in her background. &quot;My parents wereintelligent people but there was no music, no books, no nothing. I was a big Candamp; W fan as a kid -- Johnny Cash, Ray Price, people like that. But I neverheard folk music till I met John.&quot;;    The write stuff; When asked about herearly literary influences, she said sarcastically: &quot;I'm not one of thosepeople who read William Burroughs and decided suddenly I wanted to be awriter. I did read Flannery O'Connor when I was young -- but really I thinkyou're more influenced by people you know than things that you read. (WhatI've read) doesn't have anything to do with why I write the way I write.&quot;;   Even though Cervenka has sprinkled the imagery and icons of the Catholicchurch through her work, she doesn't consider herself a particularly religiousperson -- &quot;and I'm certainly not Catholic. I'm not into any patriarchalreligion except as a metaphor -- the same way I write about drinking.&quot;;   Over the course of seven albums, X tempered the raw, blunt fury of the punkmovement into an eloquent, forceful voice for social justice -- a bandconsidered by many to be the best to come out of Los Angeles since the Doors.As she and the group prepare to take X back on the road (including a July 7date at Shoreline Amphitheater as part of the huge Gathering of the Tribesshow), Cervenka professed little concern over how their loyal audience willreact to the new, mature X.;    &quot;There are a lot of young people 17, 18, 19,who are probably going to be there who couldn't possibly have seen us beforeand are expecting this . . . legend. Still, I think they'd be disappointed ifwe turned out to be just a revival act. That sort of thing can't matter to usas artists. We can't let those expectations get in the way of what we want tosay.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID PLOTNIKOFF, Mercury News Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910614  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  17  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,007  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 14, 199100166081,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
