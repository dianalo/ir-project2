Terms weren't disclosed. The licensing agreement coversproduction of genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccineworld-wide, except in Japan, Biogen said.</LP><TEXT>   The new licensing agreement eliminates the possibility ofa legal battle over rights to the vaccine technology betweenSmithKline and Merck, the two main sellers of geneticallyengineered vaccines for hepatitis B. The agreement also willgive Biogen a significant additional source of revenue fromits hepatitis B technology at a time when concern is growingabout the liver disease. Biogen said it expects to receiverevenue of more than $20 million in 1990 from its hepatitis Btechnology.   In 1987, Biogen, a biotechnology concern, won a broad U.S.patent on genetically engineered hepatitis B products. In1988, Biogen licensed SmithKline to make and sell hepatitis Bvaccine products in the U.S. and other countries, except inJapan. The licensing had set up the possibility of a legalshowdown between SmithKline and Merck, whose vaccine mighthave infringed Biogen's patent.   A SmithKline spokesman confirmed the agreement. A Merckspokesman also confirmed the pact, adding that it's part of abroader cross-licensing of hepatitis patent rights betweenMerck and SmithKline. Merck negotiated the licensingagreement, he said, &quot;because we didn't see any business sensein dragging out&quot; a dispute over patent rights to the vaccine.   Hepatitis B is a virally caused liver disease that killsan estimated 4,000 to 6,000 Americans annually. About twomillion people in the U.S. are chronically infected with thehepatitis B virus, which is responsible for an estimated $600million to $700 million annually in health-care costs.   The disease, a major cause of liver cancer, is spread bysexual contact or by exposure to blood of infected persons.High-risk groups include homosexual men, drug users who shareneedles and sexually active heterosexuals. Some 30% ofpatients with acute hepatitis B have no known risk factors,however, according to a recent study.   U.S. efforts to reduce incidence of hepatitis B haveproven ineffective, and recently some doctors have called forwider vaccination to prevent the disease. &quot;Controllinghepatitis B will require a change of strategy, away fromtargeting those at high risk and toward universal hepatitis Bvaccination,&quot; Jay H. Hoofnagle, a doctor at the NationalInstitutes of Health, recently concluded in an editorial inthe New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Hoofnagle added,however, that the cost of the vaccine -- about $120 toimmunize an adult -- may impede efforts to instituteuniversal vaccination.</TEXT></DOC>
