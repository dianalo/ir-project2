This program has been an outgrowth of the PresidentialEnergy Security Study of March 1987 and the National Coal Council's studyon the competitiveness of coal completed in late summer 1987. Coal offerssignificant opportunity for energy security, improved balance of trade,and reduced consumption of imported oil. A key element of this programis leveraging coal exports with technology -- a concept new to the U.S.government and industry. The evolution of this program grew from historicaldevelopments in international coal markets. Energy demand forecasts predictsignificant growth in world coal consumption and for steam coal in particular.The Energy Information Administration recently projected that the saleof coal on the international market would expand from nearly 370 milliontons in 1986 to more than 500 million tons by 2000. DOE believes thatthe U.S. can be a serious competitor in world coal markets, and we aresupporting a change in America's coal expert policy. U.S. coal expertpolicy is evolving from a passive, somewhat &quot;hands off&quot; approach forthe government to one that is more aggressive, more action oriented.</TEXT></DOC>
