A Mozambican National Resistance statement said almost 600 Cubansoldiers have arrived in Maputo in the past week and warned thepresence complicates ongoing peace talks.   There was no immediate comment on the claims from PresidentJoaquim Chissano's Marxist government.   Peace talks between the guerrilla organization and Mozambicanchurch leaders representing the government resumed this week inNairobi, Kenya. No details of the negotiations have been released byeither side or Kenyan mediators.   During talks last month, the two sides said they exchanged peaceplans.   The rebel statement, released in Lisbon and signed by the rebel'sresident delegate Manuel Frank, said the Cubans are members ofmotorized infantry units. It said they arrived between Aug. 25 andMonday in the Mozambican capital and more are slated to arrive nextweek.   According to Frank, government officials claim the Cubans areMozambicans returning from training in East Germany.   The rebel claims come as Cuba is involved in a phased withdrawalof about 50,000 troops in another southern African country, Angola,under an agreement in exchange for South Africa pulling out itstroops from Angola and granting Namibia independence.   Mozambique receives military aid from the Soviet Union and itsallies and has accepted several hundred Soviet, Cuban and EastGerman advisers.   But the only foreign troops known to be fighting the rebelsalongside Mozambican government forces at present are 12,000Zimbabwean soldiers protecting an oil pipeline and road and raillinks from Mozambique's Indian Ocean ports to their landlockednation.   Saturday's guerrilla statement said the government has yet toanswer the rebels' call for direct talks.   South Africa used to back Mozambique's guerrillas, but says itended its support in 1984 when it signed a mutual non-aggressionpact with Mozambique.   No government now openly supports the rebels, who are accused ofwidespread atrocities against civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
