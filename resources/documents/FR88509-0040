The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Transportation Systems is interestedin receiving comments on the practicability of designing, building anddelivering vehicles that can operate on an alternative fuel in a highlyefficient and effective manner. The DOE will not be procuring vehicles for the Federal government, butserves as technical and general advisors to the General Services Administrationin their function as the purchaser and other agencies as users of vehicles.The DOE is particularly interested in the following subjects or issuesas the basis for evaluation of approach(es) in light of constraints reflectedin criteria given below: (1) The range of minimum quantity necessary for the respondent to buildat essentially a production price. (a) Note if there is any special effect for a quantity of 5,000 vehiclestotal. (b) Note if there is any special effect for a quantity of 5,000 per yearfor four years. (2) The lead time required to provide the above quantity. (3) The fuel(s) on which the vehicle would operate. (a) Identify whether these would be mono- or dual-fuel on-board storage/use.(4) The type(s) of vehicle that could be provided, and the number of differenttypes that could be accommodated in the above situations. Include a specificnote as to ability to provide compact or mid-size sedans. (5) Any significant differences in operation (e.g., cold start, power output,acceleration, refueling time, and range) that would be encountered in useof the alternative fuel. (6) Emissions and/or energy economy benefits that would be provided. (7) Benefits that would accrue to the vehicle manufacturer; to the industry.(8) Factors that would deter manufacturer interest (e.g. absence of CAFEcredits and alternative emissions standards). Criteria that are presently envisioned are as follows: (a) The maximum cost of vehicles must comply with statuatory price limitations(Pub. L. 99-591 Section 601) plus added systems and equipment allowances(Pub. L. 91-423). (b) Life cycle costs, including trade-in value of vehicles after threeyears and approximately 40,000 miles, must be reasonably competitive withthose for conventional gasoline-fueled vehicles. (c) Standard warranty arrangements (Federal Standard 122AB Automobiles,Section 3.5 Warranty) would apply. (d) Maintenance and parts must be available from local dealers skilledin repairs of conventional vehicles plus any special features resultingfrom alternative fuel capability. (e) Vehicles must reet all applicable Federal and state regulations suchas EPA emissions requirements, DOT Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)and safety standards, and California emissions standards (if pertinent),or receive waivers to them. (f) Performance, reliability, utilization and durability must be generallycomparable to that of gasoline vehicles of the same type and class. Thevehicles will typically be used for general transportation and by a varietyof drivers. Ease of operation and refueling should be comparable to vehiclesused in a public, daily rental operation. (g) A sizeable portion of vehicles purchased will be used, at least initially,in areas where the alternative fuel is not widely or regularly available,so the vehicles must be capable of being operated on gasoline too, anditems (e) and (f) must be met under these conditions. Supply of vehiclesmay be divided between those dedicated to the alternative fuel and thoseoperable on the alternative fuel or gasoline or any blend. However, thequantity split would be dependent on selection of dedicated vehicles bythe using agency following contractual committments.(h) Operational convenience, including that of refueling, and cost of alternativefuel vehicles need to be relatively close to that of present vehicles ofcomparable size and utility in order that agencies can be encouraged tochoose them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Ten (10) copies of any response to this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice must be received by the Department byJune 23, 1988.
