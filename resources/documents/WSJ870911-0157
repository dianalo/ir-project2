The East German Communist Party chief, who returns home today, appealed for full diplomatic recognition but was rebuffed. The playing of East Germany's national anthem and the flying of its flag were as far as the West Germans would go. The West Germans pressed Mr. Honecker to lift his infamous schiessbefehl, the order to shoot East Germans trying to escape across the border, but the East German made only lukewarm promises.    And even tedious issues went unresolved. The two countries still don't agree on whether their border falls in the middle of the Elbe river or on its eastern bank.    Still, the substance of what took place made it a significant week. &quot;We can't get rid of a divided Germany and Berlin with just one trip,&quot; says Wolfgang Schaeuble, the head of the chancellor's office. &quot;But, measured against reality, we reached the upper limits of our expectations with this visit.&quot; To wit:    --While the two German states didn't establish formal diplomatic ties, they made great strides toward normalizing relations. German-German summits will likely become regular events. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had 12 hours of talks with Mr. Honecker, has already accepted an invitation to visit East Germany next year, though the meeting probably will be in Dresden, not East Berlin.    --The East Germans gained de facto access to Eureka, the pan-European research program. As part of a scientific-cooperation accord signed during the summit, West and East German researchers will work together on 27 projects ranging from physics and production technology to research in acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Many of the West German researchers are involved in Eureka.    In addition, East German researchers and technicians will have improved access to West German universities. Besides the scientific accord, agreements to exchange information on nuclear-reactor safety and protection of the environment along the East-West German border were signed.    --Trade links between the two nations will almost certainly be extended. Mr. Honecker brought with him two dozen East German business leaders, an unprecedented assemblage whose members held numerous meetings with prominent West German bankers and industrialists. While it is too early to predict if the contacts will lead to greater inter-German trade, Mr. Honecker, for one, is confident.    &quot;I believe this visit will go a long way in furthering trade relations between our two countries,&quot; the East German told a television interviewer Wednesday, following a reception for him at the Villa Huegel in Essen, once home of Germany's most famous capitalist family, the Krupps. &quot;Our trade relations have been good for some time but I believe they will be much better in the future.&quot;    Trade between the two Germanys totaled 15 billion marks ($8.3 billion) last year, or, put in perspective, less than West Germany's trade with Denmark. But negotiations are already under way for the delivery to West Germany of 2.4 billion marks of machinery and other heavy goods from East Germany, according to Honecker deputy Guenther Mittag.    Moreover, the two governments apparently made progress toward establishing a joint commission to facilitate economic exchanges. West German construction companies will build a luxury hotel in East Berlin. And the two sides are near agreement on connecting a power grid that would allow East Germany to purchase electricity from West German and other European suppliers.    This potential burst in East-West economic ties comes at a time when the U.S. is trying to crack down on the export of sensitive Western technology to the East bloc. One U.S. State Department official sees potential problems stemming from the Honecker visit.    &quot;I think it's a pretty safe bet that, in the likely normalization of relations resulting from Honecker's visit, German-German trade will increase,&quot; the official says. &quot;And whenever you increase East-West trade, you increase troubles in the Cocom context,&quot; he adds, referring to the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, which tries to restrict the sale of technology to Communist countries.    On the positive side, East Germans were treated to some Soviet-style glasnost, or openness, during Mr. Honecker's trip. East Germany is one of the most repressive members of the Soviet bloc and normally censors news to filter out Western political opinions. But for this occasion East German television covered most events live.    And East Germany's party newspaper, Neues Deutschland, carried the full text of several of Chancellor Kohl's speeches, which called for an end to the shooting at the borders and greater human rights in East Germany and affirmed West Germany's commitment to reunification. </TEXT></DOC>
