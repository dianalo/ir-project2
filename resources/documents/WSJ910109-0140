Zwick, the chairman and chiefexecutive of Southeast Banking Corp., is a man who resistschange.   He lives well below his means in the same modest home,facing a golf course in Coral Gables, that he and his wifebought years ago. He drove a 1972 Mercedes for 11 years,until some gaskets gave out and he swapped it for anotherMercedes.</LP><TEXT>   And he has done his best to preserve the status quo atSoutheast. Long the region's nonpareil financial institutionand one of only two Miami banks to survive the Depression,Southeast served most of the city's blue-chip companies. In astate not noted for history or tradition, 88-year-oldSoutheast stood out for having both.   But now, the gaskets are leaking at Southeast, too. It hashad four straight quarters of big losses. Troubled loans haveballooned. By almost every economic measure, it ranks nearthe bottom of the nation's largest 50 banks. Its ratio ofmarket capitalization to assets, a measure of its value asperceived by investors, puts it 47 out of 50, according toMontgomery Securities. Federal regulators pressured Southeastto shore up its capital ratios by the end of 1990, a demandthat Mr. Zwick says it has met.   In Miami, where the company's 55-story gray-granite andglass building dominates the skyline, &quot;people don't say`Hello' anymore -- they say, `Do you think Southeast willmake it?'&quot; says Leonard Abess Jr., the president of CityNational Bank, a small Miami-based institution.   It certainly will make it, says Mr. Zwick, who has a planfor restoring Southeast's health. Most Wall Street analystsagree it would take a protracted recession in Florida to turnSoutheast into another Bank of New England, the institutionseized by federal regulators last weekend. Still, these sameanalysts are nearly unanimous in recommending the sale ofSoutheast Banking's stock.   In some ways, Southeast's problems resemble those at manyU.S. banks. In the past decade, it binged on real-estateloans and now is suffering from indigestion as Floridaproperty values slide. And like other banks, Southeast blamespart of its trouble on zealous regulators who forced bigwritedowns.   But Southeast also illustrates something more surprising:A basically stodgy institution can get into just as muchtrouble as a highflying one. And trying to do business asusual can be almost as risky as jumping on the latestindustry bandwagon.   Mr. Zwick shied away from the merger mania that hit theSoutheastern banking community in the mid-1980s. Insistingthat Southeast remain independent, he spurned a series ofmerger overtures while his competitors grew bigger andstronger.   He refused, too, to join in the consumer-banking boom thatdrew competitors to Florida; instead, he stuck with thehigher-profit corporate business that had always been thebank's franchise. That strategy, however, eventually forcedSoutheast to become less and less conservative and moreadventuresome in its lending. In fact, it pitted thestrait-laced Southeast directly against the gold-chain Sandamp;Lspeculators swarming into Florida's commercial-real-estatemarket. By doggedly pursuing corporate business despite theobvious problems in that market, Southeast gradually becameswamped with bad loans.   Not that Mr. Zwick is anything like David L. Paul, theflamboyant former chairman of Miami's failed CenTrust SavingsBank. He is just the opposite. While Mr. Paul lived lavishly,outfitting his office with gold-inlay ceilings, Mr. Zwick isa parsimonious Yankee. His office desk is blond wood, hisbriefcase an old cloth satchel. He spends much of his timewith Miami's bluebloods; many are on his board.   And he is an egghead. A Harvard Ph.D. in economics, he isa member of the Conference Board, a business researchorganization, and Rand Corp., a think tank. He served asLyndon Johnson's budget director from early 1968 until early1969, when he was handpicked as Southeast's president andchief operating officer by Harry Hood Bassett, then the chiefexecutive. Mr. Bassett admired his visionary thinking, hisability to see the big picture.   As an executive who tries to build consensus among hismanagers and then takes a hands-off approach, Mr. Zwick says,&quot;I think I might be 10 years ahead of my time.&quot; But even someadmirers wonder whether he isn't too ivory tower. &quot;He hasn'tdeveloped the strength he should have in hands-on banking,&quot;says Nicholas DeB. Katzenbach, Johnson-era cohort andSoutheast director.   In the 1980s, Florida, with a net influx of 800 people aday, was posting bigger percentage gains in population thanany other large state. That growth made &quot;retail&quot; banking theheart, soul and profit center of banking in Florida. Everybanker knew it, it seemed, except Mr. Zwick. Barnett BanksInc., Sun Banks Inc. and others bought smaller banks inFlorida and began building ties with retail customers,catering to cash-rich retirees and tapping the smallbusinesses that are crucial to the state's economy.   Southeast did move briefly in that direction in the late1970s but then quickly pulled back. Mr. Zwick scoffed atcompetitors for spending so heavily on branches, keepingoperations decentralized and fussing over small customers.Southeast, he says, is like Lord andamp; Taylor, while archrivalBarnett, headed by Charles Rice, is more like a discountretailer.   &quot;Charlie's view, what I sometimes kid him about, is a Kmart sort of approach -- a high-volume, low-margin, high-costoperation,&quot; says Mr. Zwick. &quot;Our strategy is just theopposite. We have been very specialized.&quot;   But Barnett, which slowly laid a vast network of branchesacross Florida, has been far more successful. In the 1980s,it more than doubled its market share by emphasizing service.By 1983, it overtook Southeast in deposits, and since thenits assets have grown to $31 billion, compared withSoutheast's $14.62 billion. Despite Barnett's own problemswith commercial real estate, it remains strong andprofitable.   When Mr. Zwick, in the late 1980s, finally did begintrying to catch up in retail banking, he did it in a wayalmost suggesting that he didn't want to sully his hands.Instead of pursuing that business one customer at a time, hebought into it, acquiring thrifts and small banks at highpremiums and packages of auto loans originated by cardealerships.   Although Southeast got big chunks of the consumer marketovernight, it also got a bagful of credit problems. Byacquiring First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association ofJacksonville, for example, Southeast got 17% ofJacksonville's deposit base in 1988and so many ailing loansthat even now they account for 10% of Southeast's problemloans. The auto loans began souring in 1989, spawning morethan $40 million in losses.   Mr. Zwick concedes that &quot;we'd be better off today&quot; ifSoutheast had been more &quot;disciplined&quot; in its retailexpansion.   Instead, he was trying, by continuing to emphasizecorporate loans, to make Southeast into something of amoney-center bank, a vision that seemed to flow from hishigh-mindedness and his past as a Washington bureaucrat. Heopened a London office in the early 1970s. Reflecting hisview of Southeast as a grand institution, he assembled amultimillion-dollar art collection for it. And, under histutelage, Southeast became the biggest lender to LatinAmerica among its regional peers.   But corporate lending was becoming increasingly difficult.Margins were shrinking as big companies developed more creditsources, such as commercial paper. Many of Florida's bigcompanies -- never very numerous -- were taken over. Foreignbanks entered the competition. Southeast's own foreign foraywas no picnic, either; in 1987, the bank took a $95.5 millionloan-loss provision on Latin American loans.   As these problems mounted, Southeast reacted by becomingever more aggressive in commercial real-estate lending. &quot;Wewere the Manny Hanny, the Citibank, the Chemical forFlorida,&quot; recalls Jess S. Lawhorn, who runs its problem-assetdivision. &quot;We probably took larger loans than we possiblyshould have.&quot;   As that business, too, became more competitive, Southeastgot drawn into still more dubious ventures. It and Citicorpbankrolled the Courthouse Center tower in downtown Miami witha $36.5 million loan even though the building was started ayear after the Museum Tower, a competing project nearby thatalso was financed by Southeast. Eventually, Southeast boughtthe Courthouse project at a foreclosure auction for $32million.   Southeast also lent millions to Bertram Trojan Inc. inMiami, in a leveraged buy-out that has soured. With a slew ofbad real-estate loans, many for shopping centers and officebuildings, the bank's troubled loans climbed 78% to $613million in the year ended Sept. 30.   Mr. Zwick blames the loan problems on John E. Porta, aformer Continental Illinois executive hired in 1984. So didSoutheast's board, which has doggedly supported Mr. Zwick andforced out Mr. Porta as president and chief operating officerlast March. Mr. Porta calls blaming him for Southeast's loanproblems &quot;convenient&quot; and says that its troubles &quot;are a lotmore fundamental and deeply seated and a lot morelongstanding&quot; than bad loans. He points to the bank's postureof &quot;independence at any cost.&quot;   And, in fact, the bank's loan problems might not be sothreatening if it had found a merger partner. In the pastfive years, mergers among major Southeastern U.S. bankscreated &quot;super-regional&quot; institutions that spread out theirlending bets and made them less vulnerable to swings in anyone area. And through size alone, they got more clout in thefinancial markets.   They require, however, a delicate blending of predecessorbanks' cultures and a balancing of their executives'authority. Mr. Zwick wanted none of that. &quot;A lace factory anda coal mine don't go together very well,&quot; he says. &quot;You'regoing to end up with some dirty linen.&quot;   He turned down a golden opportunity to expand into Georgiawhen he gave First Atlanta Corp. the cold shoulder in 1984.Wachovia Corp. got it instead, and the combined FirstWachovia Corp. is now one of the healthiest banks around. Heturned down forays into the Carolinas, when he gavemuch-healthier NCNB Corp. the stiffarm several times over thepast eight years. And he repeatedly rebuffed his mostpersistent suitor, Barnett's Mr. Rice. Even as recently aslast spring, as Southeast's problems were worsening, Mr.Zwick turned Barnett away.   Mr. Zwick says keeping Southeast an independent bank ishis proudest achievement. He considers bank mergers a fad. Acombination, he adds, would have diluted Southeast's biggeststrength, the fact that it is one of only two Florida-basedstatewide banking operations (Barnett is the other).   Now the offers are drying up. Mr. Rice doesn't rule outsomeday making another overture, but because of the weakmarket for banks' stocks and the worries about their capital,&quot;I see no way for most institutions to have meaningfuldiscussions,&quot; he says.   That's fine by Mr. Zwick. He views the problems atSoutheast as temporary. It survived a worse real-estate slumpin the 1970s and &quot;snapped back quickly,&quot; he notes. He hopesto solve its problems through, among other things, assetsales, a tighter focus on profitable lines like privatebanking, and an economic turnaround in Florida. &quot;This is avery valuable franchise, and we're going to keep on buildingit,&quot; he says.   But some options are no longer available. Raising capitalin the equity markets, for instance, is doubtful now thatSoutheast's stock is so low. The stock has plummeted from $28a share in October 1989 to $4.125 a share, far below itsSept. 30 book value of $18.17 a share. Under regulatorypressure, Southeast omitted its dividend in September andagain last month.   And asset sales are going slowly. In September, Southeastdid sell its residential-mortgage-servicing portfolio to aunit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., but it is having troubleunloading its credit-card portfolio, a centerpiece of itsbailout strategy. Because a lot of banks are trying to sellsimilar businesses, premiums have declined rapidly.Real-estate sales are slow, too.   A gallows humor pervades Southeast. For a recent managers'meeting, Mr. Zwick had a transparency made up that read, &quot;Thefloggings will continue until morale improves.&quot; And itdoesn't help that some buzzards have chosen Southeast'sheadquarters as a gathering place. They spend the day soaringon the building's updrafts, prompting jokes from visitors.   Bank officials call the ugly birds a sign of winter,nothing more. Mr. Zwick insists they don't bother him. &quot;Yousee them,&quot; he says, gazing out his conference-room window. &quot;Idon't see them.&quot;   ---                  Market Value Is Low...
