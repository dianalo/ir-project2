A device resembling a bomb was found in thegunman's pocket.   The device, discovered after the gunman's body was taken to themedical examiner's office, prompted the evacuation of the officefor about an hour while a bomb squad removed it.   ``They found what appears to be a homemade bomb,'' said homicideLt. Joseph W. Witte. ``It's a tube of smokeless powder with somesort of detonator.''   Police had not determined whether the device could haveexploded, he said.   Daniel Wright, 37, apparently broke into the house shortlybefore 6 a.m., shot the woman and two children, set the fire andcommitted suicide, Witte said.   Firefighters found the house filled with tear gas when theyarrived, according to the lieutenant. They found a tear-gascanister in a second-floor hallway, near the rear bedroom where thebodies of Wright, Daniel Rivera, 7, and Maurice Rivera, 4, werefound, Witte said.   The boys' mother, 29-year-old Agnes Rivera, was found on thefirst floor in a small bathroom at the bottom of a stairway, Wittesaid.   ``Our theory is that she was shot at the top of the steps andfell into the bathroom,'' Witte said.   Authorities believe Wright set off the tear-gas canister, Wittesaid.   Three adults and a child who also occupied the house escapedwithout injury, Witte said. The child and two adults went out thefront door, and the third adult was rescued from the roof.   Wright apparently set the blaze in the second-floor bedroom,Witte said. The house sustained mostly smoke and water damage onthe second floor.   Police found a .30-30-caliber rifle in the bedroom. Policeestimated it had been fired five or six times.   Wright and Ms. Rivera's common-law marriage ended about a monthago, Witte said. Ms. Rivera threw him out of the house.   Neighbors and relatives said there had been tension betweenWright and Ms. Rivera for some time.   ``He was always threatening her,'' said Ms. Rivera's uncle,Hector Rivera. ``He said if they would ever break up, he would killher.''</TEXT></DOC>
