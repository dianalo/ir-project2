Jonathan Kandell, 43, who was fired as assistant foreign editorof the Journal on May 2, filed the lawsuit Tuesday.   The Journal accused Kandell of lifting uncredited material fromanother writer's book for a page 1 article about threeentrepreneurs in Eastern Europe.   Roger May, a spokesman for Journal owner Dow Jones andamp; Co., said,``Dow Jones believes the suit is utterly without merit and thecompany intends to defend itself vigorously.''   Kandell's article on March 30 profiled a Soviet machine toolmaker, a Czechoslovak inventor and a Hungarian banker asindividuals succeeding in the private sector.   Kandell said he based the story on interviews with the three intheir countries after hearing them speak at a November meeting inNew York sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations.   He said that at the same meeting he learned of the book``Communist Entrepreneurs'' and met its author, John W. Kiser III.He said he later ``read the book once and put it aside.''   Kandell's suit said he told his editors that he hadn't creditedKiser's book in his article because he had ``done all his ownlegwork and the book was not where he had first learned of thesubject.''   On May 1, Kandell said, the editors told him they had decided heshould have mentioned Kiser's book in the article, ``but emphasizedthat it was a judgment call.''   Later that same day, Kandell said, he learned he was to befired. He quoted Paul Steiger, a deputy managing editor, as sayinghe had a gut feeling that Kandell had not been truthful and that hehad shown a ``lack of candor.''   Kandell said he was dismissed the next day after consulting withhis lawyer and refusing to sign a letter of resignation that hesaid would have kept him on the Journal's payroll through June 30.   In his lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,Kandell contends he was libeled and his professional reputationdestroyed by the Journal. He demanded $10 million in punitivedamages and $2.64 million in compensation for ``willful, wanton andreckless disregard of the truth'' and ``actual malice'' on thepaper's part.   He said the libel was contained in a letter of apology that thenewspaper sent to the author of a book dealing with the samesubject and in a subsequent article in the weekly newspaper TheVillage Voice about Kandell's case. The Village Voice was not namedas a defendant in the suit.   Kandell's suit also demanded the return of original notes andother documents that he contended the paper's editors had kept,knowing they would support his position.</TEXT></DOC>
