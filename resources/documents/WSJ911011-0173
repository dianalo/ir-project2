The grim report, quoted in the official China Daily, addsto foreign environmental specialists' descriptions of China'sindustrial areas, some shrouded year round in thick yellowsmog, as among the most polluted areas on Earth.   Air pollution in China worsened steadily in 1990, becausefactories, fueled mainly by coal, continued spewing wastegases, sulfur dioxide and industrial dust, the report said.China is the world's fourth-largest producer of so-calledgreenhouse gases, carbon-based emissions believed to causeglobal warming. Its coal has a high sulfur content, a majoringredient in acid rain.   Waste gas emissions rose 2.8% from 1989, the report said.Sulfur dioxide and dust emissions remained high. Northerncities, where people wear face masks to protect againstairborne dirt, are more seriously affected than those in thesouth.   Pollution is poisoning the nation's water supply, thereport said. China poured 35.4 billion tons of waste-waterinto the sea and rivers in 1990. Of the 94 rivers that flowthrough major Chinese cities, 65 were polluted, the reportsaid.                                                                                                          MINICAR SALES FALL IN JAPAN                                                                                                          Sales of minivehicles in Japan in May slipped 11% to145,614 units from a year earlier, the first such declinesince March 1990, a trade group said, but termed this only apause in an upward trend. Minivehicle sales grew quicklyfollowing a March 1990 increase in the standard engine size,and rose to a record 1.9 million units in the year endedMarch 31, up 18% from fiscal 1990. Last month, sales ofminicars fell 7.7% to 68,238 units, and minitrucks were off14% at 77,376.                                                                                                          CONSTITUTION FOR BURKINA FASO                                                                                                          Voters in Burkina Faso, formerly Upper Volta, approved adraft constitution, the military-led government said. Itprovides for executive, legislative and judicial bodies thatwill make the West African nation's president less powerful,and for presidential elections every seven years. Thegovernment, after four coups and numerous coup attempts in 10years, has promised a multiparty democracy.                                                                                                          HONG KONG BILL OF RIGHTS                                                                                                          Hong Kong's legislature passed a bill of rights in a bidto protect residents after the British colony reverts toChinese rule in 1997. But the measure won't have legalprecedence over the constitution under which China willgovern the territory. Beijing has pledged to safeguard humanrights and retain Hong Kong's legal and capitalistic systemsfor 50 years after the transfer. The rights bill was aresponse to concern that China, having suppressed its ownpro-democracy movement, could renege on its promises.                                                                                                          BRITAIN'S `DEVIL DOGS'                                                                                                          BILL Britain proposed legislation to require neuteringdangerous dogs, but it dropped plans to destroy about 10,000pit bull terriers. That breed, which the media dubbed &quot;DevilDogs&quot; after attacks on children, could be owned only underrestrictive conditions designed to phase out the breed inBritain. Import bans would apply to several breeds of&quot;fighting dogs.&quot; Offenders could be fined $8,500 or jailedfor six months.                                                                                                          SEOUL-MOSCOW TECHNOLOGY SWAP                                                                                                          South Korea and the Soviet Union agreed to the transfer ofhigh technologies, exchanges of scientists and jointresearch, Seoul said. They hope to combine Soviet technologywith South Korean production and marketing skills for mutualgains. The accord calls for Moscow to transfer 48technologies for commercialization, selected earlier throughworking-level contacts, over five years.                                                                                                          ILLITERACY IN VIETNAM                                                                                                          GROWS A decade after Hanoi said it had wiped outilliteracy, more than two million of Vietnam's 66 millionpeople can't read or write, the official newspaper SaigonGiai Phong, or Liberated Saigon, said.   But a recent report in an unofficial newspaper in Ho ChiMinh City put the number at nine million. Illiteracy andschool delinquency are growing at alarming rates, LiberatedSaigon said. About three million children don't attend schoolor have received only some education, which the paper called&quot;very worrying for the entire nation,&quot; a society that hastraditionally valued education.   The illiteracy growth has been fueled by Vietnam'seconomic problems and by the communist government's grantingnew freedom for individuals to make money as they like in amarket economy, according to television, radio and newspaperreports.   The monthly magazine For the Children said more and morechildren wre leaving elementary school early to follow theirparents into the rice fields, to pan for gold in mountainstreams or work as porters carrying goods to and from China.
