The journalist said he was the only Western reporter whowitnessed the demonstration and that police stopped him from talkingwith students and shoved him into a police van.   The official Xinhua News Agency said in a report late Sunday thatmore than 70 Tibetan students had been persuaded not to stage thedemonstration at Tiananmen Square, the political center of Beijing.   It said the students, from the Central Institute forNationalities, had not applied for permission to stage ademonstration and were taken back to the institute by bus.   Seth Faison, of the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong, saidfive Chinese police officers pulled him away from the protesters,picked him up and pushed him into the police vehicle.   Faison, 29, of Brooklyn, N.Y., said he was questioned for twohours and released.   He was told he violated three city regulations: trespassing on apublic lawn, disturbing the flow of traffic and failing to followpolice instructions. Police told him he would not be charged withthe violations, Faison said.   Faison said he saw about 60 people marching in western Beijingshortly before noon. The marchers told him they were Tibetanstudents.   ``They are killing our people, they are killing our people,''Faison quoted the marchers as saying.   Pro-independence activists clashed with Chinese security forcesin Tibet's capital, Lhasa, on Dec. 10. Official Chinese reports saidone monk was killed and 13 people were injured when security forcesshot at the activists.   Western witnesses said they saw two bodies, including a smallchild, and that Tibetans told them seven people were killed.   Faison said the marchers told him they had walked downChanganjie, Beijing's main street, past Tiananmen Square andZhongnanhai, a walled compound housing offices and homes of some ofthe country's highest-ranking leaders.   Faison said he did not know whether any were arrested because hewas removed from the scene quickly. The Xinhua report did notmention arrests.   Tibetan activists seeking an end to 38 years of Chinese Communistrule in Tibet and the return of the Dalai Lama have demonstratedrepeatedly over the past 14 months in Lhasa. A small group ofTibetans also marched in Beijing late last fall.   At least 38 people were killed in violent clashes with police onOct. 1, 1987 and in March in Lhasa, Western travelers said.   The Dalai Lama, whom Tibetan Buddhists believe is thereincarnation of Tibet's protector god, led Tibet's civiladministration before Communist Chinese troops entered in 1950.
