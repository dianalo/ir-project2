(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Large-scale image systems; USAA case studyandM;Historically the mobile American military officer had difficulty obtainingquality insurance.andP;  USAA (United Services Automobile Association) was formedas a member-owned organization to provide insurance and financial services tomilitary officers, former officers, and their families.andP;  Serving the twomillion members and associate members has made USAA one of the largestinsurers in the United States, the largest mail order company in America, anda diverse financial association with over $16 billion in owned or managedassets.andM;USAA members (customers) deal directly with the association, primarily at itshome office--there are no agents in local communities.andP;  As a result, USAA hasa huge quantity of mail and telephone calls.andP;  To support this workload, themanagement of USAA has an explicit and continuing policy to be a user ofleading-edge technology.andP;  This includes the use of optical disk-based imagesystems to maintain customer files.andM;Currently USAA receives 80 000 to 125 000 letters each day.andP;  Over half arepayments; others are directed to the different services, which include abank, investment companies, claims, staff, and so forth; and over 10 000 aday are for the Property and Casualty Policy Service and Underwritingfunctions.andP;  The last is the are selected for the first image project.andP;  Eachof the letters directed to this function may contain a variety of differenttypes of information.andP;  It may consist of several pages of plain text, forms,appraisals, applications, and even the envelope that records the postmarkdate.andP;  The letter, considered a &quot;document,&quot; ranges from one page to hundredsof pages, with an average size of 2.45 pages.andM;In 1982 a project was begun to study the image concepts and develop therequirements and plans for a large-scale document image system.andP;  Severaloffers to build a custom system were considered and rejected.andP;  A standardproduct was required for maintainability, reconfigurability, andexpandability.andM;Concepts were tested and requirements were identified from a percentage ofactual customer mail during 1984 to 1987, using a prototype 3M system and aFileNet[TM] system.andP;  In 1987 IBM was selected to implement the MVS/ESA[TM]ImagePlus[TM] system to fulfill these requirements.andM;The image systemandM;Background.andP;  In the late 1960s, USAA recognized that it had a severe paperproblem.andP;  The association was drowning in a sea of paper that was interferingwith service to its members.andP;  In January 1969, the chief executive officer atUSAA challenged the association to become paperless.andP;  Paper-handlingprocedures improved so dramatically during the 1970s that two attempts toconvert the primary files to microfilm were unsuccessful; the savings did notjustify the inconvenience of film.andM;By the early 1980s, image technology was starting to emerge.andP;  It wasconsidered by USAA for the property and casualty insurance areas--such asautomobile and homeowner insurance--which had the largest files, both inclaims and in underwriting.andP;  The property and casualty underwriting files,serving sales, service, accounting, underwriting, and production, wereselected as the flagship application for analysis and implementation.andM;When the research project began in 1982, 196 people were dedicated todelivering the mail and maintaining the 1.3 million files.andP;  By 1987, asfull-scale implementation took place, paper-handling procedures had improvedto the extent that only 161 people were required to sort and deliver the mailand maintain 1.7 million files.andP;  Today the image system supports about 2million files, with a staff of roughly 40 users and technicians to operateand maintains the image system.andM;In the original system, active documents were stored in a paper folder, onefor each member-customer.andP;  These files took 37 000 to 39 000 square feet(3500 square meters) of prime office space, an area larger than a footballfield.andP;  A crew of clerks continuously reviewed the files, looking at thecontents of each file every year or two, to remove the older documents.andP;  Theinactive documents filled 80 000 boxes in a warehouse-like records center,where they are stored for the remainder of their seven-year life.andM;The paper files were both labor- and space-intensive.andP;  The goals of the imagesystem, therefore, were toandM;* Provide compact storage for the files.andP;  If all the files were placed onoptical disks, and the disks were put on shelves, the shelves would take lessthan 100 square feet (10 square meters) of floor space.andM;* Identify and index each document on the mainframes, so it can be accessedexactly like any other corporate data, and can be used with $Iexistingbusiness applications.andP;  (USAA could not rewrite all its programssimultaneously to use the new form of customer file.)andM;* Deliver the documents electronically.andP;  Immediate access through terminalslocated anywhere in the country improves service and productivity.andP;  Theelectronic movement insures correct delivery and reduces the chance for loss,as well as saving clerical staff.andM;Benefits of implementation.andP;  Image systems provide extraordinary advantagesto users with large document filing problems.andP;  The first application at USAAsupports 2000 professionals accessing 2 million files that will eventuallyencompass almost 2 billion pages.andP;  The scope and cost of such a system isvery large, but the benefits are similarly great and fall into several majorcategories, as described in the following paragraphs.andM;Reduced support costs.andP;  Support costs are reduced by the savings in clericalstaff, office (file) space, warehouse space, equipment, and supplies.andP;  Thesedirect savings can be estimated with reasonable confidence prior toimplementation of the project.andM;The direct savings were calculated to be $5 million per yer for the firstsystem at USAA.andP;  The cost of operating the image system over the first fiveyears, including equipment, staff, and supplies, averaged $5 million per yearat USAA.andP;  These direct savings were projected to pay for the system, but didnot in themselves provide a sufficient return on investment to justify thesystem.andM;Improved productivity.andP;  The productivity of the professionals using thesystem is improved through immediate access to the files necessary to serve acustomer, as well as better management and control of the work in process.andO;Paper-intensive shops often claim 30 percent or more productivityimprovement.andP;  These benefits are very large and important to thejustification of the system, but cannot be projected accurately prior to theinstallation of the system.andM;At USAA, 85 percent of the work is received by telephone rather than by mail,and sophisticated online systems provide information to handle most callswithout access to the files.andP;  Improving access to the files through an imagesystem has a much smaller advantage at USAA than at many sites.andP;  USAAmanagers estimated that savings among the 2000 professionals who initiallyused the system would be 2 to perrcent.andP;  Since this is a large group ofprofessional users, the savings at USAA total about $1 million per year foreach percent of productivity improvement, and will probably amount to anadditional $2 to 10 million per year.andM;Improved service.andP;  Customer service is improved by the immediate,simultaneous access to files from anywhere in the association.andP;  All theinformation needed to serve the customer at once is always there.andP;  Thesesavings are intangible but important.andM;Improved security.andP;  Document and file security is improved since papers arenot removed; there are no missing files or misfiled documents.andP;  An on-lineaudit trail records the processing of a document, the modifications, and whohandled it.andP;  Documents that are accidentally or maliciously deleted can berecovered.andP;  Off-site back-up copies of the records are practical.andP;  Secure andencrypted data channels can be used, if desired, providing even more privacythan is possible in moving paper.andP;  These benefits are also intangible, butare valuable even though it is difficult to assign a cash value to each one.andM;System architecture.andP;  Images of documents require very large amounts of datacompared to conventional data processing records.andP;  Each page of abusiness-size document starts as a 500 000-byte record (about 4 millionbits).andP;  After compression, each page averages 50 000 bytes and might range insize (depending on the amount of detail on the page) from 10 000 to 200 000bytes or more.andP;  The several pages of a document (such as a two-page form orletter, and an envelope with postmark) are stored together as a single&quot;object&quot; that requires tens of thousands of bytes.andP;  For lage documents,millions of bytes are required.andM;Not only is each image object large, but in a typical operational imagesystem there are very large numbers of these records, so that the totalamount of data to be stored is extremely large.andP;  The large-scale ImagePlusarchitecture allows this information to be stored and managed, if desired, ona separate computer system that can be configured and tuned to the differenttype of data.andM;In addition to the very large image objects, there must be an indexdescribing each document.andP;  There will be tens or hundreds of millions ofdocuments in an operational image system; the index database will have acomparable number of records.andP;  Despite its large overall size, this index isa conventional database in record size, performance, recoverability, andother requirements, and so is run on the regular mainframe computer.andM;The user interface to access image files needs to be integrated with theexisting data processing systems, so users do not have to interrupt theirwork and move to a different system to retrieve data (as with most paper andmicrofilm systems).andP;  This interface can be through consecutive InformationManagement System (IMS) or Customer Information Control System (CICS)transactions, or through integration within the business application.andP;  Ineither case, the index database needs to be close to the businessapplications (on the same machine), rather than on a separate image computersystem.andM;Figure 1 shoes the general layout of the MVS/ESA ImagePlus architecture.andP;  Thefollowing numbered paragraphs are associated with the numbers in Figure 1.andM;1.andP;  The data system pictured in the center is the existing on-line dataprocessing system, running CICS or IMs for other business applications.andP;  Theimage system is driven by the new &quot;folder&quot; or &quot;case&quot; transactions, or bycalls from the application programs, that run on this system.andP;  If there areseveral processors, such as in regional computer centers, the image can berun from all of the processors--generally from whatever CPU runs the businesstransactions for that customerandM;2.andP;  The image index on the data system includes business information aboutall of the documents in the system, such as data received, line of business,customer number, form number of the document, description, and the internalcodes (names) necessary to find the document.andP;  This is a very large logicaldatabase, and may be split into smaller physical databases by imageapplication or customer.andM;3.andP;  There are several smaller databases on the same system, with informationon the work waiting to be processed, work waiting to be scanned, thequalifications of employees, supervisor assignments, and so forth.andM;4.andP;  Communications to the data terminals can be through existing data linesto existing terminals, or new terminals and communications approaches can beused.andP;  The image system will operate with any IBM 3270-type data terminalconnection compatible with other on-line software.andM;5.andP;  The image computer system is shown in Figure 1 as a separate centralprocessor.andP;  In a pilot or small operation, this can reside on the same systemas other business applications, such as the data system (Figure 1, 1).andP;  In alarge-scale production operation, images are sufficiently different that itmay be more efficient to use one or several separate computer systemscustomized to image system requirements.andM;6.andP;  The distribution manager is a CICS application that receives requestsfrom one or several folder applications on the data system (Figure 1, 1),finds the object on the specified storage manager (onthe same or othermachines), and sends that image to the workstation.andM;7.andP;  The storage manager is part of Multiple Virtual Storage/Data FacilityProduct (MVS/DFP[TM]), providing operating system level management of andaccess to the optical storage system.andP;  It uses DATABASE 2[TM] (DB2[TM]) tomanage its index and other storage.andM;8.andP;  A separate index of each document is required on the image systemprocessor, containing storage information such as the location of each copyof the image.andM;9.andP;  Objects (images) are temporarily stored on magnetic disk when they firstenter the system, and sometimes during the life of the document whenexceptional performance is required.andP;  They are generally on magnetic diskwhile they are queued in the routing system for processing.andM;10.andP;  The optical storage is connected to the image system.andP;  It consists ofdisks that are readily accessible in the library (juke box), as well as thedisks that have become inactive and have been moved to a shelf for manualmounting.andM;11.andP;  Communications from the image system to the image workstations consistof several local and/or remote Token-Ring Networks.andP;  This provides therequired high-capacity connections while using standard components.andP;  Thereare no peer-to-peer communications on a particular ring, so there are noconstraints on the network configuration.andP;  There is no capacity limitation ifa particular ring becomes full; it can simply be split into multiple rings.andM;12.andP;  Indexing (for mixed type documents) is performed from paper rather thanafter an image is scanned, so is done on a standard data terminal, as shownon the left in Figure 1.andM;13.andP;  Images are scanned or printed at any workstation that is configured withthe necessary scanner or printer.andP;  The request to print and the indexinginformation for the scanned document come from any data terminal, so thescanner/printer workstation does not have to have a dedicated data terminalor data connection.andM;14.andP;  The image workstation can be viewe logically as two separate terminals,sometimes (but not always) implemented as separate devices.andP;  The dataterminal is a standard IBM 3270-type device, either real or emulated.andP;  Theimage terminal receives several documents, each consisting of several pages.andO;It is responsible for displaying them in the best way possible, whether in aPresentation Manager[TM] window or (preferably) as a full-size full-pageimage.andP;  The image terminal is also responsible for page turn, zoom, displayof multiple pages (if desired), and any other manipulation of the severalpages in use.andP;  It can be configured with a custom keypad, as shown, providingspecific image functions.andM;USage.andP;  Three aspects of hands-on experience are discussed, the entry ofdocuments into the system, the initial processing, and the means used forfile references.andM;Document entry.andP;  Entering the document into the system proved to be mucheasier than expected.andP;  Existing procedures are followed as far as possible,such as opening the mail, extracting and arranging the contents, andidentifying the customer.andP;  The actual indexing is done wherever the mail isfirst read to determine the routing, whether in the mail room or in the userarea.andM;To perform the indexing, the customer is identified through a standard dataterminal on the data system.andP;  Then an &quot;Index&quot; transaction is executed tocollect data about the document.andP;  If a form number or code for the type ofdocument can be entered, the indexing screen can be largely prefilled tosimplify entry, review, and editing.andP;  When the indexing information iscomplete, it is saved in a temporary database, and the assigned key iswritten on the document.andM;After the document is indexed, it is moved to the scanner, which is aseparate workstation connected to the image system.andP;  The temporary ID writtenon the document is entered, which sumultaneously turns on the scanner andbegins the verification of the number entered.andM;Operating the scanner is similar to making an office copy.andP;  Each page isentered, and the quality of each image is checked as it is scanned.andP;  Thescanner is adjusted and the pages rescanned as required to provide a goodimage.andM;Whan all the pages are entered, checked, and in order, the document isregistered.andP;  Registration: first, moves the image from the scannerworkstation (Figure 1, 13) to the image host (Figure 1, 5); second, causesthe image to be stored by the storage manager (Figure 1, 7); third, advisesthe data system (Figure 1, 1) that the document has been registred; which,fourth, updates the index (Figure 1, 2) to show the document is in the systemand available.andP;  If the document requires processing,  the routing databases(Figure 1, 3) are simultaneously updated.andP;  The temporary ID and databaseentries are then deleted from the system.andP;  Within seconds of completion ofthe scanning, the document is available to any authorized user anywhere onthe system across the country.andM;Initial processing.andP;  In a very small office, work is typically delivered to asingle person who then allocates and distributes the work to the rest of thestaff.andP;  All work is assigned to someone, but if that person falls behind (oris absent), the work is easily reassigned.andP;  With everyone working together,equitable distribution of the work is not much of a problem, and highpriority and difficult work is rarely lost.andM;The problem is different in certain larger offices.andP;  Work is typically keptin a central pool and allocated in smaller batches, so that equitabledisribution can be measured and so that high priority and difficult work canbe tracked.andP;  This image system works on the latter basis, i.e., work isnormally stored in unique departmental queues for each type of work.andP;  Asupervisor can manually assign work to a specic person's queue, and work thathas been started by a user and suspended remains in the user's personal queueto be completed.andM;A priority for each document is computed bt the system, based on the type ofwork and age.andP;  A two-dimensional table provides the needed flexibility andsimplicity.andP;  The typical entries are line of business (automobile, homeowner,boat insurance) and type of transaction (quote, new policy, change,complaint, estate, etc.).andP;  The values in the table include the initialpriority, amount the priority will increase each day, and the queue in whichthe work should be placed for management.andM;When a system user is ready to begin work, a command is issued, in the formof a transaction on the data terminal, to &quot;Send Work.&quot;andP;  The system selectsthe highest priority active task in the personal work queue or, if none,selects the highest priority work among the several queues that thesupervisor has assigned.andM;Once the one &quot;best&quot; document is selected by the system, the user receives apicture of the document to be processed on the image display.andP;  The first pagewill be visible, with the other pages available by pressing the &quot;Next Page&quot;key.andP;  The data screen shows the processing history--an electronic &quot;back slip&quot;with notes equivalent to &quot;The letter arrived yesterday afternoon,&quot; or&quot;Finished the auto insurance request, but need help with the boat insurancerequest.&quot;andP;  The date, time, and employee identification are also recorded eachtime the document is handled, together with any notes that the employee mayadd (such as why the work was not completed).andM;The existing data processing application programs were designed to processthe information on the document (i.e., letter or form) efficiently.andP;  Nothinghas changed but the medium.andP;  The document is now presented, just as before,but on a display rather than a piece of paper.andP;  With the instructions anddocument at hand, processing can take place using the existing applicationsprograms.andP;  The existing programs need not be changed in any way, althoughthey can be modified, if desired, to interface directly to the image system.andM;When the user is finished working on the document, another command is issuedto &quot;Wind Up&quot; processing.andP;  Three choices are available: First, if all stepshave been completed, the document can be filed (if actually has been &quot;in thefile&quot; available to all users since it was scanned, but there is no morerouting).andP;  Second, it can be routed elsewhere for further processing.andP;  Third,work can be suspended until a later date and time (for example, if thecustomer needs to be called).andM;File reference (archive processing).andP;  While handling current mail ottelephone calls, it is sometimes necessary to view a document from the files.andO;Entering the command &quot;File&quot; will show the index of documents in any file, forthe current customer (or other customer, if specified), for the most recent18 months (or any specified year), including all types of documents (or justthe specified file &quot;tab&quot;--line of business).andP;  This is based on the indexdatabase(Figure 1, 2).andM;While looking at the index on the data display, the user may select one orseveral documents to be viewed, printed, or routed for processing.andP;  Thefolder application program on the data system (Figure 1, 1) sends therequired commands to the image computer system (Figure 1, 5).andP;  The storagemanager (Figure 1,7) finds the image for the distribution manager (Figure 1,6), which sends it over the token ring (Figure 1, 11) to the imageworkstation (Figure 1, 14).andM;Computer output.andP;  A normal customer file is not limited to only the receiveddocumets, but also includes replies and copies of documents sent to thecustomer, exactly as sent.andP;  This permanent record might also includedocuments received electronically, such as credit reports and motor vehiclereports.andM;One method to store the documents that were in the computer system would beto print them and scan them.andP;  Not only would this consume much paper andlabor, but there is a more efficient way to store the image.andM;The information can be formatted, as if it were to be printed, and thencaptured.andP;  By doing so, a typical page takes a few hundred or thousand bytes,rather than the 50 000 bytes required for a typical image.andP;  The original dataprocessing programs are no longer required, so the documents will be usable&quot;forever.&quot;andP;  However, it is not practical to revise or process theinformation, just to read it on a display or print it on paper.andM;Forms on which the presentation text would have been printed can be stored ina separate library, so the image of the form does not have to be storedhundreds or thousands of times per day.andP;  Each page of the presentation textcan point to the form on which it will be displayed.andP;  These forms include:andM;* Letterheads with just a logo and return address, on which a large amount ofvariable information is printed.andM;* Traditional forms with many &quot;boxes&quot; for data, on which a modest amountinformation is printedandM;* Contract pages (the &quot;fine print&quot;), where the variable information mightinclude only a page number and/or customer numberandM;Supervisor functions.andP;  In a paper environment, the backlog of work can becounted periodically, and the productivity of an employee can be estimated byhow often the in-box must be refilled.andP;  Between formal counts, supervisorscan estimate the progress of their workers by looking at the stacks of paperwaiting to be processed.andP;  With an image system, all the visual clues used byexperienced supervisors are gone.andP;  The stacks of paper must be replaced bycomparable information provided by the image system.andM;A holdover display provides a summary of the work waiting for each departmentor other work group.andP;  A queue display lists the characteristics of eachdocument waiting to be processed for any customer, user, work group, or typeof work.andP;  From the queue display, supervisors can examine the document (Whatdid the letter say?) or the processing history (Why isn't it processed yet?),andO;without leaving the desk.andM;Supervisors also use the system to assign work to their employees.andP;  They canassign all the different types of work for which the employee is qualified,or limit the employee to specific types.andP;  To assist another department, anemployee can even be assigned certain work normally handled by thatdepartment.andM;Performance.andP;  The users required that the basic operations take about thesame amount of time as they would on paper.andP;  A &quot;page turn&quot; to the next,previous, first, last, or a specific page in the current document or set ofdocuments occurs in about one second.andP;  Page turns of even a few secondsinterfere with productivity when a large set of documents is being reviewed.andM;Active documents, i.e., those that would be in the &quot;in basket&quot; forprocessing, are displayed in less than five seconds.andP;  This requires that theybe on magnetic storage, including a prefetch if they have been migrated tooptical disk.andM;Random retrievals of documents in the file may be a little slower.andP;  Mostretrievals occur in the first year, while the paper would be kept in theoffice area or while the optical disks are in the robotic library or jukebox.andP;  The users agreed to a goal of 15 to 20 seconds, which is fast enough toserve customers while they are still on the phone.andM;Requests for older documents are rare enough that storage space is moreimportant than speed.andP;  Users were willing to keep older optical disks on ashelf rather than in a juke box, and wait minutes for retrieval (even thoughit will mean calling the customer back) while an operator manually mounts thedisk.andP;  When the optical disk is mounted, the requested document is moved tomagnetic storage for a few days so that the disk does not need to remainmounted, yet the document will be available quickly during the call-back.andO;Users recall that retrieval of older paper or microfilm documents took manyhours, or even days.andM;Discoveries and lessons learnedandM;Use of a separate machine.andP;  At USAA, the images require several terabytes(million megabytes) for just the first image application, which is morestorage than all of the other data processing systems combined.andP;  Themanagement of this temendous amount of information will present someinteresting challenges.andM;The ImagePlus architecture allows use of a separate computer to store andmanage the images, or allows storage on the primary data processing computersystem.andP;  If a low-volume pilot system is being built, or if the primarymachine supports a widely varying workload, that existing computer system canalso support image.andP;  In a large installation, where the primary computersystem is finely tuned to a particular on-line workload, it may be moreeffective to use a separate image machine that can be configurated and tunedto this very unusual workload.andP;  USAA chose to keep the images on a separatesystem.andM;Need to index before scanning.andP;  One of the key discoveries in the severalyears of image research at USAA concerned the sequence of indexing andscanning for mixed types of documents.andP;  Like most beginners, USAA intuitivelyconcluded that the documents should be scanned before indexing.andP;  This wouldminimize paper handling and allow a visual quality check as the image wasused to index the document.andM;As the procedures were developed, there were many cases where the paper wasrequired after identifying the document and the customer.andP;  (When scanning isdone first, the purpuse is to handle the paper quickly without pausing toidentify what it is.)andP;  Representative cases include the following:andM;* Business decision required before acceptance of the document.andP;  For example,when an account is in arrears, partial payment may not be acceptable.andP;  When acheck arrives with a letter, it is separated and deposited with the thousandsof other checks received that day.andP;  Hours later, when the customer isidentified and the document is indexed, the warning not to accept the checkis finally noted, but it is too late.andM;* Need to return document.andP;  The original document, such as appraisals andcertificates, may need to be returned to the sender.andP;  The document is notexamined during scanning; by the time the image is indexed, the originalpaper document is buried among thousands of other documents and is difficultto recover.andP;  Furthermore, it is not apparent from the image whether a copy ofa certificate was submitted (which does not need to be returned) or theoriginal.andM;* Use of turn-around form.andP;  Some blank forms or return envelopes arereceived.andP;  If not examined first, they might be scanned into the system anddestroyed.andP;  The appropriate action may be to process the document first, thenenter the completed form into the system, then return it as originallyrequested.andP;  The solution to all these and many similar problems was to indexthe document before scanning.andP;  Although counter-intuitive, the paper onlytraveled slightly farther in the process.andP;  By doing the indexing from paper,the analysis of the document and identification of the customer is completedwhile the paper is still available for any special handling.andM;Standardizing index descriptions.andP;  It was feared that it would be burdensometo capture a description of each document.andP;  Mail room personnel found thatthey reused a few descriptions frequently, so standard descriptions wereentered in tables.andP;  (Thirty-five descriptions covered 90 percent of thecases; 50 descriptions covered 95 percent.)andP;  System tables now allow hundredsof standard descriptions for practically all forms.andM;Key to the success seems to be the abstract description of a document withoutany business judgment.andP;  For example, a good description might be&quot;Correspondence from the insured about auto insurance,&quot; not &quot;Request toincrease collision coverage on '87 Oldsmobile to...&quot;.andM;Separating indexing and scanning operations.andP;  The indexing and scanningoperations were separated, since different skills are required.andP;  indexing isperformed by a person highly trained in office skills; scanning is largely amechanical process performed by a clerical employee.andP;  Because there are manymore indexing clerks than scanner operators, separating the functions alsogreatly reduces the investment in scanning equipment.andM;When the indexing and scanning operations are separated, there must be someway of linking the image with the descriptive and routing information.andP;  Asthe document is indexed, the system generates and returns the key (temporaryID) to the database that temporarily holds the indexing and routinginformation.andP;  That key is written on the document and is entered when thedocument is scanned.andP;  By using the customer number, normally found on thedocuments, as prt of the temporary ID, the writing is reduced and errorrecovery simplified.andM;Adjustment of scanner speed.andP;  Scanning is similar to using an office copier,a comparison that provided many helpful ideas during the requirements study.andO;Correspondence and other office documents received by mail come in largequantities with mixed sizes, weights, and folds.andP;  No one would consider usinga high-speed stack-fed copier to reproduce such a volume of mail, yet thescanner vendors felt that would be appropriate.andP;  Likewise, copiers thatrequire each page to be aligned under a lid for a 10-second or longer scanwould not be practical for 25 000 pages per day.andM;After experimenting with various copiers, the scanner requirements were setat 1 to 3 seconds per page, with an automatic feed, and the original returnednear the input station to allow rescanning (or reverse side scanning) ifrequired.andP;  An occasional document, such as an express mail envelope, needs aflat-bed scanner.andM;Ability to view a list rather than a folder.andP;  Some image systems move theentire contents of a folder to the user, simulating the delivery of a paperfolder, so that the file can be brosed.andP;  This approach requires that a filebe kept on a contiguous area of the optical disk to make retrieval timetolerable.andP;  As new documents are added, the optical disks have to bereorganized to consolidate documents within a file and make space foradditional documents.andP;  With the relatively slow performance of write-onceoptical storage, this is expensive.andM;The USAA analysis showed that normally only a few documents actually have tobe viewed.andP;  With a good list of what is the file, it is very rare that theentire file has to be read.andP;  This makes it practical to store the documentsin the sequence received, optimizing use of the optical disks.andM;In 24 percent of the cases in the first application at USAA, the userssatisfied their inquiry without reference to any documents.andP;  Simply knowingwhether a document was (or was not) in the file, based on the index, wassufficient.andM;Routing single items.andP;  Use of image systems provides an opportunity to managethe work more closely.andP;  Rather than distributing a package of work (such as25 documents) to a user, most work is kept in a common queue.andP;  There is lesschance that ahigh priority piece of work will be buried behind other work insomeone's work packet.andP;  As described above, when a user requests a piece ofmail via the &quot;Send Work&quot; command, the system examines the employeequalifications, the supervisor assignmnts, and the priorities of all thewaiting work, and selects the one best document for this user to process atthis instant.andP;  That one item, with both the image and the processing history,is sent to the user to be processed.andM;Integration within application programs.andP;  Image systems can be an integralpart of a business application.andP;  For example, when renewing the record of aninsurance policy, the insurance processing programs could use a function keyto automatically display the image of the original application for thatinsurance policy.andP;  In the extreme case, users have even asked that therelevant postmark be displayed when inputting the effective date of a policy.andM;Although the integration is certainly possible, this ties the implementationof a new technology to the redesign of existing computer systems.andP;  Thealternative is to deliver a document for use with existing computer systems.andO;The document appears vertically on a display screen, rather than lyinghorizontally as a piece of paper on the desk, but the same programs work aswell (or as poorly) as they ever did.andM;The decision for the first system at USAA was to use the existing applicationprograms because they had recently been rewritten at a cost of over $100million over a five-year period.andP;  At the same time, the image utility feelsintegrated to the user, since the same data terminal is used, and commoninformation, such as the customer number, is automatically picked up by theimage system.andM;Storage of computer-generated data.andP;  The image system was justified by tehhigh cost and slow processing of paper mail.andP;  Once the system was available,there was a desire to include the outgoing correspondence with the rst of thefile, and perhaps the insurance policies and other documents.andP;  It was a greatsurprise to find how much computer-generated data were produced &quot;to befiled.&quot;andP;  The initial system supported about 10 000 letters received each day.andO;The computer output, however, included about 140 000 documents.andM;Since computer-generated data can be stored very efficiently in the imagesystem as presentation text, a new opportunity emerged.andP;  For example, onlythe declaration pge of a policy, summarizing the insurance coverages, wasstored on microfilm.andP;  The extra cost of storing the additional standardcontract pages on the image system was extremely small, since each pageconsisted primarily of a pointer to that page in the form library.andP;  Thebusiness benefits of being able to refer to exactly the same document as thecustomer is substantial.andP;  Therefore, in addition to a large number ofdocuments, there is also a larger number of pages.andM;Solving display resolution requirements.andP;  The amount of information in apicture is very large.andP;  Information is required for the placement of each inkdot for character representation, including the specific style and position.andO;This occurs because the image system must represent the original documentexactly as it appeared, rather than optimizing the character style for theimage system hardware.andM;Practically all business documents can be read if a minimum of 100 pixels aredisplayed for each inch of the original document.andP;  If the pixel is less thanthe ideal square that just touches its neighbor, the 100 pixels per inch (4pixels per millimeter) is not adequate.andP;  Likewise, anything less than 100pixels per inch proved inadequate.andM;Since reading &quot;practically any&quot; document isn't good enough, the decision wasmade to scan and store at 200 pixels per inch of the original document (8pixels per millimeter).andP;  This insured the capture of the information in thesmallest print ordinarily used in business.andP;  These conclusions are confirmedby the international facsimile standards for business documents at 98 or 196pixels per inch vertically by 203 pixels per inch horizontally (7.7 by 8pixels per millimeter).[1,2]andM;The economics of displays led to the selection of image displays that couldsupport 100 pixels per inch of the original document.andP;  At this level, atleast 1150 lines are required on the screen to display a full 8 1/2- by11-inch (or A-4 size) page with titles and status lines as usual.andP;  This istwo to four times as much detail as on normal displays, and 10 percent morethan most &quot;high resolution&quot; displays.andP;  Therefore either special displays arerequired, or only a partial page can be displayed.andM;It is occasionally necessary to print a page (at a higher resolution) or&quot;zoom in&quot; to display a larger image.andP;  With the 200 pixels per inch available,the zoom shows more detail and not just a larger version of the same image.andM;Simplifying system functions.andP;  When interviewed, or when seeing technologydemonstrations, users were initially anxious to have many image-handlingfeatures.andP;  To our surprise, after they trid the features, the users did notlike the windows, mice, or other &quot;high tech&quot; functions.andP;  For example, afterworking with a mouse long enough to become proficient, they asked that it beremoved.andP;  There was a strong preference for a simple keypad with dedicatedkeys for page turn, zoom, rearranging pages, and other simple functions.andM;Need for full-page display.andP;  In most paper factories much of the processingconsists of entering information from the paper (letter or application) intothe computer system, or comparing that information with data previouslyentered.andP;  In order to use existing programs to process the data, a fullscreen of data and a standard keyboard must be available while simultaneouslyviewing the image.andP;  To minimize the &quot;paper handling&quot; effort, users asked fora full page of paer to be visible at once.andP;  They did not want to take time tomove around a page of a letter looking for data needed for each field.andM;Two test systems were installed: one with a separate display for image, thesize of a sheet of paper, located adjacent to a conventional data terminal,and the other with a single large display showing data on one side and imageon the other.andP;  Management and analysts vigorously preferred the singledisplay.andP;  It seemed more logical.andP;  The users did not care whether they had asingle large display or specialized but separate image and data displays.andO;They were far more concerned with simplicity, speed, and ease of use.andM;Timely access to filed documents.andP;  Access to a paper file typically took longenough that, if file information were necessary during a phone call, userspreferred to call the customer back.andP;  A significant productivity gain couldbe achieved if the customer could be served during the initial phone call.andO;Recognizing that immediate access was not practical, users asked for10-second access, and agreed to tolerate up to 15 or 20 seconds.andP;  They areconcerned about &quot;what to talk about&quot; while waiting for the document.andM;More study may show that this requirement can be somewhat relaxed.andP;  In theoccasional periods of poor performance as the system was being developed,users almost never recorded problems until response time exceeded 30 to 45seconds, indicating, perhaps, a viable service level.andM;Need for service to remote users.andP;  USAA operates a very centralized dataprocessing operation.andP;  About two-thirds of the employees are located in thehome office, and all data processing is provided from the centralizedlocation.andP;  The field offices are responsible for terminal installation anduse, but do not provide a 24-hour computer operation.andM;USAA wants to maintain a similar operation for imae.andP;  It would be very costlyto build and operate a high-security computer room in each field office.andP;  Toprovide remote service comparable to the home office, very high-speedcommunication lines can be used.andP;  A 256 Kbps data channel adds only a secondor two to the access time for the first page of a document.andP;  Since the firstpage is displayed as soon as it arrives; that time is the relevantconsideration; the other pages need to arrive only after the first page hasbeen read.andM;In the type of use of USAA (light use throughout the day with most mailprocessing concentrated in a few hours while the volume of phone calls islow), a single 256 Kbps data channel supports almost 200 image terminals.andP;  Ata member office, the same communications speed is required to maintainresponse time, even though the utilization of the lines may be low.andM;In addition to large offices, the image system must support the &quot;one-personoffice,&quot; such as a remote claims staff or &quot;walk-in&quot; service area.andP;  Whenimages are needed, they will be requested through the existing data teminal(which might be a laptop computer with a cellular phone).andP;  The image would bedelivered through a facsimile machine.andP;  The same facsimile would also be usedto enter images.andP;  The image technology in ImagePlus is virtually identical tothe facsimile technology.andM;The midsize office (such as an insurance agency or claims operation) is oneof the remaining challenges.andP;  The offices are too small to justify high-speedcommunications lines to support immediate access from central storage.andP;  Thereare too many users in the office for individual facsimile machines and phonelines.andP;  Distributed image storage is less secure than a regular computerfacility unless special precautions are taken.andM;Several solutions are being explored to provide temporary image storagelocally with primary storage on the host, including networks of personalcomputers with shared communications, a new configuration of AS/400 system,placing a special &quot;object distribution manager&quot; on a smaller remote machine,and even networks of the RISK System/6000[TM] machines.andP;  The question is onlywihch of these several possible approaches, or others, will be supported.andM;Ability to decentralize image storage.andP;  At some time USAA may want todecentralize its computer operations.andP;  A requirement for the ImagePlus systemwas that the image storage could be decentralized, which has been tested.andM;Images can be stored in the cities where the document is most likely to beused (each field office), or in the same cities where the data are stored,whether centrally or distributed.andP;  The plan is that old images will normallystay where they are initially stored, even if the rest of the data for thecustomer (and any new images) move to a different system.andP;  The system recordswhere the documents are stored and retrieves them from that original locationif they are later needed.andM;Conversion of existing files.andP;  It was assumed that the existing filesdocuments would have to be converted.andP;  How else would the benefits ofimmediate access accrue?andP;  However, two factors argue against conversion:andM;1.andP;  In most applications, documents undergo the highest activity at thebeginning of their life; converting old documents has less benefit thanmaking the new documents available on the system.andM;2.andP;  The cost of conversion is very high, primarily since each document mustbe read and handled again.andP;  This is not a major cost for new documents beingentered into the image syste, since the indexing can be done during theregular processing of the documents.andM;At USAA the requirement for a wholesale conversion was dropped when it wasrecognized that the conversion would take over 10 years, longer than theseven-year life of the documents.andP;  In practice, archived paper documentsbeing retrieved for the field offices are being entered in the sytem asrequested (called &quot;on-demand conversion&quot;), rather than being copied andmailed.andP;  There will probably be other applications in the future whereconversion is requiredandM;Concluding remarksandM;Getting started.andP;  The temptation is always to start small and simply: find agroup of five people with a filing problem and install the new technologywith minimal risk.andP;  The difficulty with this approach is that such a smallsystem may not be cost effective compared to the use of microfilm or paper.andO;For example, it may be cheaper to expand the file capacity for that testgroup by installing additional file cabinets near all the users.andP;  When theimage system is not cost effective (compared to a few file cabinets),companies have wrongly stopped considering image systems.andM;In contrast to the small systems, there are unique problems in maintaining alarge set of files.andP;  Two thousand USAA users cannot all &quot;sit next to&quot; twomillion customer files.andP;  If a separate professional staff is required tomaintain the files, the problem is probably at a level that image may be easyto justify.andP;  A large-scale image system can solve file access problems thatare unique to such a large-scale operation, and can be extraordinary costefective.andP;  Furthermore, a large installation can have sufficient benefits tocover the overhead of introducing a new technology.andM;The decision to start with a large application does not require a suddeninstallation.andP;  Image systems can be implemented for a small group, andprocedures can be tested and users trained before proceeding.andP;  The key isthat no one should expect to see major benefits with just a few users, beforethe installation is complete.andM;Outlook for image systems.andP;  Small image systems have been available &quot;off theshelf&quot; for years, but are difficult to justify based on cost, compared topaper or microfilm.andM;Large custom systems have been available for years.andP;  There are legitimateconcerns about flexiblity, maintainability, and expandability, but theydemonstrate that there are no hidden technical limitations to preventbuilding a large system.andM;With the USAA prototype of the IBM MVS/ESA ImagePlus system, large-scale &quot;offthe shelf&quot; image systems are generally available.andM;The next step USAA.andP;  At USAA today over 1400 image terminals are in daily usefor over 2000 users in the Property and Casualty Policy Service andUnderwriting area.andP;  All of the incoming mail (an average of over 10 000letters or 25 000 pages per day) has been stored in the system for about ayear.andP;  Most of the outgoing mail is or will soon be stored, which is anadditional 140 000 documents totaling nearly a million pages per day.andO;Correspondence and policies are presently stored on the system.andM;The second project is well under way.andP;  It will include an additional 3000 to4500 terminals on the enterprise image system to support claims processing.andO;In addition to office documents, it will include facilities to storeapproximately one million color photos per year and recordings of ahalf-million telephone conversations.andM;Work has begun on a third project to store applications and correspondencefor our bank credit card center.andP;  An estimated 120 image terminals will berequired.andM;Countless other application areas are waiting to be provided with imageservices, such as life and health insurance, real estate investments,transfer agency, tax records, personnel records, accounts payable, and eventhe general office files.andM;Image systems have been in operation at USAA for several years.andP;  Even thoughthe technology will continue to advance rapidly, we believe that the time tomove to image systems is now!andP;  The operators like using the system more thanworking with paper.andP;  Always having the needed documents when a customer callswill improve customer service.andP;  The systems are cost justified.andP;  Therefore,the outlook is great--great for the users of the system, great for thecustomers, and great for the &quot;bottom line&quot; of the business.andM;AcknowledgmentsandM;The authors wish to acknowledge several people whose support made this imageproject a resounding success.andP;
