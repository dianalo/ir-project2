SIMPSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Vatican and the Soviet Union establisheddiplomatic ties Thursday for the first time since the founding ofthe communist state 74 years ago.   The Vatican and Moscow said the two sides have agreed toexchange representatives with the rank of apostolic nuncio, orpapal envoy, and extraordinary ambassador.   The ties fall short of full diplomatic relations. Vaticanspokesman Joaquin Navarro described them as ``pre-diplomaticrelations'' and said there was ``room for further development.'' Hegave no indication when ties might be upgraded.   There are a number of problems to be resolved, including thestatus of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. It was suppressed underSoviet dictator Josef Stalin and incorporated into the RussianOrthodox Church.   Still, the move was an extraordinary advance in relationsbetween the center of the Roman Catholic Church and a state thatdeclared war against religion after the Bolshevik revolution of1917.   It also reflects the vastly improved climate in relationsbetween the church and Soviet bloc countries since the collapse ofhard-line Communist leaderships.   Relations have steadily improved under Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev. The decision to establish ties came during his talkswith the pope at the Vatican on Dec. 1. It was the first meetingbetween a Roman pontiff and a supreme Soviet leader.   Initially, the two representatives will not have permanentresidences.   But Navarro said the papal nuncio could decide to keep anassistant in Moscow if he thought it was needed.   The Vatican will be represented by Archbishop FrancescoColasuonno, an Italian prelate who has been a roving Vatican envoyto Eastern Europe.   The name of the Soviet ambassador was not immediately announced.   The Vatican and Moscow had diplomatic relations under theRussian czars, but those ties were broken when the Communists cameto power.   One of the main points of friction between Moscow and Rome hasbeen the Ukrainian church.   It would regain legal status under a proposed freedom ofreligion law promised by Gorbachev when he met with the pope. Butas yet the measure has not been adopted.   Gorbachev also invited the pope to the Soviet Union, but theVatican gave no indication when John Paul would accept theinvitation.   The pope had previously been barred from visiting his flock inLithuania. The situation could be further complicated by therepublic's recent declaration of independence from the Soviet Union.   Over the past few months, in a further sign of the improvedVatican-Soviet relations, John Paul has received a number of Sovietvisitors. A Soviet journalist for the first time traveled on thepope's plane on an African pilgrimage in January.   In the past year, full relations were reestablished with Poland,the pope's homeland, and Hungary. John Paul visits Czechoslovakianext month.   On Wednesday, the Vatican restored the leadership of thelong-persecuted Roman Catholic Church in Romania and revived theEastern rite branch that was suppressed there in 1948. Itssituation was similar to that of the Ukrainian Catholic church.</TEXT></DOC>
