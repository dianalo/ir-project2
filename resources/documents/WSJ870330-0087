Ms. Gallagher, like an estimated 1.9 million other people, works out of her home; she arranges stints to perform as a clown at functions in the Washington, D.C., area. But there isn't much to smile about on this recent day. Julie has scattered her mother's work paraphernalia all over the basement: A rubber chicken lies sprawled amid a pile of snaps, buttons and other clothing accessories.    Although a growing number of families are looking to home-based work to meet child-care needs, many are finding that jobs and child-rearing don't mix.    In a survey by a City University of New York professor of environmental psychology, Kathleen Christensen, half of the mothers of pre-school children who did paid professional or clerical work at home were forced to turn to somebody else to watch the kids. And research funded by the Russell Sage Foundation found last year that a majority of home-based clerical workers at a Wisconsin insurance firm couldn't juggle the job and kids. Many quit the company within two years.    &quot;The great myth is that someone can sit there with a keyboard in one hand and the baby in the other,&quot; says Gil Gordon, a Monmouth Junction, N.J., consultant on &quot;telecommuting&quot; -- working at home by computer. &quot;It just doesn't work out.&quot;    For the parents who stick with home-based work, the consequences can be daunting. Children can foul up the work, messing up papers or worse. Many parents suffer exhaustion as they try to shoehorn job duties into early-morning or late-night hours to avoid the noisy distractions of an active child. Others feel guilty about diverting their attention from child to work. Sometimes, both the kids and the work suffer from a lack of attention.    The problems, however, haven't derailed a growing trend toward working at home. In California, which is considering introducing a home-based work program for some state employees, over half of those interested say they hope it will give them more time with their families.    Many companies appeal to that desire in their drive to cut labor costs by farming out work to part-timers and holding down fringe benefits. When employees at a North Carolina insurance company demanded an in-house day-care program, the company responded by offering them a chance to work at home, according to a North Carolina State University study.    The same study found that corporate managers in general tend to think working at home is an effective substitute for professional day care. That premise helps underpin a current movement in Congress toward lifting 44-year-old federal curbs on industrial work performed at home; proposed legislation would permit makers of women's apparel, gloves and other clothing to employ workers in their homes.    Day-care expenses &quot;put a hole in your pocketbook,&quot; says Jean Suber-Smith, a manager of home-based workers at Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Carolina. &quot;It's a definite benefit to work at home.&quot;    Still, many parents who try juggling child-rearing and jobs find it too much to handle. Some are forced to turn to professional day care or babysitters -- the very thing they wanted to avoid.    Janet Nelson, who makes clothes at her Itasca, Ill., home, found it impossible to sew during the day as she had hoped, because of her two active children. For one thing, her infant son was colicky, rarely sleeping more than two hours at a time.    Last spring, her weight dropped from overwork as she labored round the clock to finish five bridesmaid dresses while managing her household. Finally, she sent the kids to day care for half of every day -- at $130 a week. &quot;That's a big chunk of our income,&quot; she says. &quot;I needed the space.&quot;    Managing toddlers is tough even with two working parents present. Larry Mortimer and his wife started a planning and architectural business out of their Oakland, Calif., home. But the arrival of a baby boy scotched their plans. &quot;Being able to set the child down just to play -- that just didn't happen,&quot; Mr. Mortimer says. &quot;He was constantly bringing things over, or he would want to be held.&quot; The problem contributed to the couple's decision to move their business out of the home and hire a babysitter.    Other parents are forced to drop their jobs. About a year ago, Pam Starobin's four-month-old son, Isaac, started crying as she tried to sell software over the phone to the owner of a Philadelphia restaurant. As Ms. Starobin asked the potential client to wait while she tended to Isaac, the harried restaurateur hung up.    &quot;I couldn't do two things at once -- it was just too stressful,&quot; says Ms. Starobin, who left the software business. &quot;It was an agonizing decision to think that I couldn't do it all. But when I stopped, I realized how much nicer life was.&quot;    Others return to the office. About a year ago, Brenda Schuldt quit her job at a Styrofoam factory and started a children's clothing business out of her home, so that she could be with her newborn son and young daughter. But squeezing in work wasn't easy. She would get up at 5 a.m. to take care of bookkeeping duties, then would dress and feed the kids when they awoke a few hours later. She was unable to get back to her job until the afternoon, when her children took a three-hour nap. Amid all her parenting responsibilities, she couldn't fit in 40 hours of work a week.    &quot;I couldn't draw a definite line -- I'd drop everything for my children,&quot; recalls Mrs. Schuldt, who has returned to work at the factory, part-time.    Meanwhile, some parents have decided to adapt -- no matter how difficult. Gail Jeffreys, who does layouts for books and magazines at her home in a Chicago suburb, works as late as 2 a.m. while her children are asleep. But she grapples constantly with fatigue, and her husband complains they don't spend enough time together.    Mrs. Jeffreys says she keeps crayons and paper in one of her desk drawers for the kids. And, she admits, &quot;the TV's a babysitter for my son while I'm working.&quot; But night is still the best time to work, particularly since she must keep track of each hour she works for her clients. &quot;Every time I get up I need to jot down when I leave and when I come back, and that gets to be a hassle,&quot; she says.    Others simply try to drown out the unrelenting demands of their children. One woman interviewed for the City University of New York study wears earmuffs. Another turns up the volume on the radio.    Some family specialists fear parents will lose self-esteem when they realize they can't handle both the job and the child. One accountant says she felt guilty whenever the phone rang; often her son would be crying, needing his diaper changed.    Many women who combine jobs and child-rearing at home &quot;feel like failures -- they blame themselves and feel that it is something they are doing wrong,&quot; says Prof. Christensen of City University.    Despite such problems, some parents manage to make the two roles mix. That's often easiest, they say, when the work is part-time and the children have grown beyond the early toddler stage.    Debi Kvalheim, for instance, runs a 20-hour-a-week mail-order business out of her Wrightwood, Calif., house while raising two pre-schoolers. The children sometimes help out. When packaging orders, the two children will pull the needed items off the shelves. &quot;The older they get, the easier it gets,&quot; Ms. Kvalheim says. Her four-year-old daughter even answers the phone.    &quot;If it got to the point where I had to send them to day care so I could work at home,&quot; Ms. Kvalheim says, &quot;I would be defeating the whole purpose.&quot;    ---   Home or Office?    If given a choice between working at the office or at home by &quot;telecommuting,&quot; surveyed employees said they would:    Continue to go to the office every day 56%     Split their time between home and office        36%   Work at home 7%    Source: Honeywell Information Systems Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
