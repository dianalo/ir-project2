Thirty-one of 52 people aboard were killed in the disaster earlyMonday, which occurred when the Boeing 707 swept in low from thesea, struck two houses and trees and smashed into a field a fewhundred yards from a runway which lacked sophisticated landingguidance equipment.   Investigation of the crash revolved around a number of questionsraised by airport officials and pilots:   _Did the pilot miscalculate the altitude or angle of descent?   _Did the altimeter, the instrument that measures altitude, fail?   _Did the pilot misunderstand instructions from air trafficcontrollers or receive bad advice?   _Did a bank of fog suddenly roll across the runway, robbing thepilot's vision?   Uganda's transport minister arrived in Rome Tuesday to join aninvestigation led by the Italian Transport Ministry. A separateinvestigation will be conducted by Italian magistrates.   Crucial to the probe will be tapes of cockpit-towerconversations and an examination of the ``black box'' instrumentrecordings found by rescuers.   Stefano Rusconi, who directs the technical division of theItalian pilots' union, said on state television that other airlineshad decided to divert flights late Sunday night from the fog-boundLeonardo da Vinci airport.   He also noted that the runway the Ugandan pilot was aiming foris one of two runways at the airport without the Instrument LandingSystem, which gives pilots information about their altitude. Fourof the main runways are equipped with the system.   Three Communist Party parliamentary deputies appealed to thetransport and interior ministries for ``immediate administrativemeasures'' to ensure that all runways in Italy have the landingguidance euipment.   Rusconi said Italian pilots have complained frequently aboutItalian airports that don't have the most up-to-date devices.   Hospitals treating survivors reported that at least two of the21 injured victims were in serious condition. One was identified asVictoria Komukyeya, described as a Ugandan princess from Toro, aformer kingdom in western Uganda.   Among those reported in good condition was 8-month-old RichardGait and his parents, Geoffrey and Ruth, of Bath, England, whoescaped from the burning plane with minor injuries.   The British Embassy in Rome identified two Britons among thedead as Manjeet Dhillon, who also held Nigerian citizenship, andKara Ibrahim Noor Mohamed, a native of Bolton, England. Their ageswere not available.   Among the dead were six Ugandan members of the flight crew,including the pilot and co-pilot.   By late Tuesday, neither the airline nor Ugandan governmentofficials in Rome had released a list of the dead.</TEXT></DOC>
