Finley Kumble, which at one time had 700 lawyers, collapsed several weeks ago heavily in debt. The suit seeks $15 million in compensatory damages. Each of the plaintiffs also seeks $20 million in punitive damages from each of the six Finley Kumble principals named in the suit.    A man answering the telephone in the office of Harvey Myerson, former managing partner of Finley Kumble's home office in New York and one of those named in the suit, said Mr. Myerson wasn't aware of the suit. The man declined to identify himself.    The others named in the suit couldn't be reached. They are: Marshall Manley, Steven J. Kumble, Robert B. Washington, Robert H. London and Alan U. Schwartz.    The four real-estate attorneys bringing the suit, David G. Ellsworth, Richard F. Davis, Michael P. Simondi and Douglas A. Dodds, joined Finley Kumble after their firm, Memel, Jacobs andamp; Ellsworth, collapsed early last year.    In their suit, they claim they were told Finley Kumble had only $9 million of debt and didn't borrow to meet partner distributions. The attorneys claim they found out after joining the firm that it had borrowed $27 million against its receivables to pay its partners.    The suit also names Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., one of the firm's creditors. As previously reported, last week, Richard G. Osborn, a former litigation partner in Finley Kumble's Beverly Hills, Calif., office, sued Manufacturers Hanover and three other banks and all of his former partners in the firm, in a suit that seeks to have a receiver appointed to liquidate the firm.    Manufacturers Hanover, a unit of New York-based Manufacturers Hanover Corp., couldn't be reached. </TEXT></DOC>
