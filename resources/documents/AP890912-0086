(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With Jim Bakker's fraud trial resemblingan episode of ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,'' the TVevangelist's decorator today took jurors on a video tour of Jim andTammy's glitzy VIP hotel suite.   Using a screen set up in front of the jury box, James Taggartdescribed the gold-plated bathroom fixtures, antique beds andmirrored walls of the Heritage Grand Hotel's fourth-floorpresidential suite, where the Bakkers stayed at times.   ``Who requested you to do the work?'' prosecutor Jerry Millerasked.   ``Mr. Bakker,'' Taggart responded.   Under cross-examination, Taggart testified that other celebritiesstayed in the 4,000-square-foot suite, but they had to be clearedthrough Bakker's office.   On Monday, Taggart, using a wooden pointer and enlargedphotographs of Bakker's homes, described other decorating work hedid for the evangelist.   Taggart's testimony came three days after he was sentenced tomore than 17 years in prison and fined $500,000. Taggart and hisbrother David were convicted of evading $525,000 in taxes on moneyfrom PTL.   James Taggart said Bakker ordered him to give his Highland Beach,Fla., condominium ``a very glamorous look.'' PTL bought andrenovated the condo in 1982 for $500,000.   Taggart said he sought to give the oceanfront unit the``theatrical presence'' Bakker liked: plenty of mirrors, andmotorized drapes with invisible seams. He said he decorated thecondo for Christmas 1982 with a tree that cost $5,000 and featuredhand-blown glass ornaments.   Don Hardister, the Bakkers' former bodyguard, testified on Mondaythat the couple's son, Jamie, had a two-story tree house at Tega Caythat at one time was air conditioned.   The prosecutor asked what happened to the air conditioner.   ``I took it out and put it in the doghouse,'' Hardister said.   Bakker is on trial in federal court on 24 counts of fraud andconspiracy and could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and finedmore than $5 million. Prosecutors say he used nearly $4 million inministry funds to live in high style.   ``The Bakkers had a tendency to grow very bored with what theyhad,'' Taggart testified about Bakker and his wife, who is notcharged. ``It was not unusual to see something completely replacedmore than once.''   The Bakkers' five-level Tega Cay, S.C., parsonage underwentextensive redecorating, Taggart said. The master bedroom was changedcompletely at least twice and the living room three times, he said.   PTL ``partners'' _ big money contributors who were promised threenights' lodging a year for life in the evangelical empire's hotels,also took the stand today, including a woman with 13 children and 21grandchildren.   Sarah Combs of Spanishburg, W.Va., said she and her husband, adisabled coal miner, were living on $400 a month but donated $1,000of a $19,000 black-lung compensation fund for a partnership in theHeritage Grand Hotel.   But she said, ``Every time I called, I would talk to someone elseand they would give me a different reason why there wasn't anyroom.''   In all, 23 witnesses testified Monday, most describing theBakkers' lifestyle, including:   _ A $570 shower curtain for daughter Tammy Sue's bathroom and$439 worth for throw pillows for her bedroom.   _ An insurance policy that covered more than $158,000 worth offurs and jewelry. PTL paid the premium, which totaled about $2,500in 1985.   _ $83,000 in security equipment at the Bakkers' Gatlinburg,Tenn., home.   _ A $10,910 Rolex watch Mrs. Bakker purchased.   At least once, Taggart said, Bakker joked about his expensivetrips. During a trip to Palm Springs, Calif., Taggart said, Bakkertold those present to ``thank the PTL partners.''</TEXT></DOC>
