After approving stiff penalties -- ranging from loss of federal benefits to execution -- for drug-related crimes, lawmakers voted to narrow the longstanding constitutional principle that excludes from use at trial any evidence that has been gained illegally.    &quot;Anything that's harsh and is aimed at drug abusers is going to pass,&quot; lamented Rep. Charles Rangel (D., N.Y.), who was on the losing side on each major vote yesterday as the lawmakers continued their consideration of the bill. The House is expected to pass the wide-ranging measure next week.    In a departure from Supreme Court decisions dating back to 1914, lawmakers voted 259-134 to allow prosecutors to introduce evidence in trials that was obtained without a search warrant as long as police believed they were complying with the Fourth Amendment's protection against illegal search and seizure. The provision, sponsored by Rep. Daniel Lungren (R., Calif.), isn't limited to drug-related cases.    The Reagan adminstration has long sought this change in the legal principle, known as the exclusionary rule. The administration argues that the rule hampers police who, while not following the letter of the law, act in good faith.    The House included a similar provision in its version of the 1986 drug bill, the last major anti-drug legislation enacted, but it was later dropped. The provision will likely face opposition in the Senate and scrutiny by the courts. Senators are working on an omnibus drug bill of their own.    Earlier, lawmakers voted 299-111 to permit the execution of those convicted in federal courts of drug-related killings. The amendment, offered by Rep. George Gekas (R., Pa.), also would allow courts to impose prison terms of at least 20 years on those convicted of a drug-related killing.    The House included a similar death-penalty provision in its version of the 1986 drug bill, but the Senate blocked it. The provision could face similar problems this year.    Opponents of capital punishment argued that it would be self-defeating because many drug-smuggling operations are based in countries that won't extradite criminals who could face the death penalty. But Mr. Gekas countered, &quot;The war on drugs cannot be won, cannot be fully fought without the ultimate weapon.&quot;    The House also voted 335-67 to deny a broad range of federal benefits, including student loans, public housing and veterans' benefits, to repeat drug-law offenders. Only retirement, welfare, health and disability benefits would be exempt.    &quot;Nobody believes the taxpayers should subsidize those who break the drug laws of this country,&quot; said Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.), the amendment's sponsor.    Under the provision, benefits would be cut off for five years for anyone convicted of two or more drug offenses in a 10-year period, and for 10 years for convicted drug dealers. Benefits could be restored sooner to those who complete a rehabilitation program.    The 375-page House bill, the consolidation of the work of nine committees, seeks to attack illicit drugs in the U.S. on many fronts, boosting efforts to block their entrance into the country, to educate young people to their dangers and to treat those who have become addicted to them.    The legislation would require chemical makers and distributors to keep records and file periodic reports about sales and shipments of chemicals that could be used to make illicit drugs. The measure would also strengthen record keeping requirements for large cash transactions at banks and savings and loan institutions to combat money laundering by drug dealers.    Unresolved is how Congress would pay for the $2.1 billion in additional federal spending for the year beginning Oct. 1 that the Congressional Budget Office estimates would result from the bill.    In a letter to congressional leaders yesterday, White House budget chief James Miller warned Congress that it must find savings someplace to offset the cost of the drug bill if it is to avoid triggering across-the-board budget cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. </TEXT></DOC>
