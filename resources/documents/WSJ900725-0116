Suchinvestment is good for the U.S. economy. It is not a Japaneseinvasion nor this country's defeat by the Japanese.   And there are many Americans who benefit, especially thosewho sold properties to Japanese investors. And there is thisto remember: Real-estate properties cannot be physicallymoved; they are not something the Japanese investors canbring home. You should not worry about the nationality ofyour landlord because it does not affect the nature of theproperty.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. real-estate properties are attractive to Japaneseinvestors because they give a higher return and more valuethan those in Japan. Also, it is logical and desirable forthe U.S. to encourage foreign direct investment, which bringsa fair amount of foreign money into the U.S.   Considering the fact that the U.S. real-estate market isslow, I believe it is good for the U.S. economy to encouragethe Japanese to invest in the U.S. and let Japanese moneycompensate for this slow-market situation.   Hiroshi Asada   Westport, Conn.   ---   Your June 19 installment stated that &quot;Fujitsu has noAmericans in top management.&quot; I and my colleagues weregreatly amused to learn that we were not members of seniormanagement. As a Fujitsu America board member, chairman ofFujitsu America's North American data-storage researchsubsidiary, Intellistor, and president of Fujitsu's largestproducts group, Norman Petersen, for example, is certainly amember of senior management even by the narrowest ofstandards. I, myself, am a senior vice president of FujitsuAmerica, have run two Fujitsu subsidiary companies and am aboard member of Fujitsu America subsidiary companies.   At Fujitsu America, 49 members of our top-management team-- vice-president level and above -- are American. This is aparticular point of pride for Fujitsu.   While some foreign-owned companies may be struggling toAmericanize their U.S. operations, we at Fujitsu America takegreat pride in our continuing progress.   Arthur J. Gemmell   Senior Vice President   Fujitsu America   San Jose, Calif.   ---   In the June 15 segment, you mentioned the almost&quot;adversarial&quot; attitude of the younger generation of Japanesetoward the U.S. This is a dangerous attitude that must becorrected soon if we are to avoid future conflict. Much ofthe blame should be placed on the shoulders of Japaneseeducators, who for many years now have tried to distort andcover up the causes and hard facts of World War II. Ineffect, they are lying to the younger generations. Now, manyof these people who will one day take over the reins ofgovernment know only about the atomic bombing of their citiesby the U.S., but do not know much about their own aggressionand their brutal suppression of the hapless civilians theimperial army conquered 50 years ago.   The younger generation sees Japan only as the &quot;victim&quot; inthe war, and subconsciously may want to get even.   Jacinto Chua   Verona, N.J.   ---   How would the Japanese have treated America if they hadstruck first with atomic weapons, devastated our towns andindustries, won the war and occupied our country? Would theyhave saved and honored our chief of state, restored ourinstitutions, rebuilt our economy and subsidized andprotected us? Not likely. That may be one good reason for ourdistrust of the Japanese.   As to their economic success, why should we begrudge themthat? We set them up and got them going. Now, their mainoffense is that they have found out what our consumers wantand are filling our needs expertly. If they can do that theyshould make money and we should learn some lessons from them.We need tough competition to make us improve our own game.   Warren Coloney   Bethesda, Md.   ---   The June 13 sidebar implied, as many have recently, thatthe U.S. savings rate is substantially below that of Japan's(5.4% to 16.8%). If you increase U.S. savings by addingSocial Security contributions, the savings rates are muchcloser (15% to 16.8%). An additional adjustment could be madefor residential-property enhancements, which Americans thinkof as savings but national income accounting reports as grossprivate investment. In addition, putting a dollar figure onthe unaccounted-for time and money Americans invest in theirhomes would also increase the U.S. savings rate.   A second common misrepresentation concerns Japan's grossprivate domestic investment as a percentage of gross nationalproduct being higher than that of the U.S. (25.7% to 14.8%).The U.S. invests 6% of GNP in defense, compared with 1% forJapan, so the adjusted figures are 26.7% and 20.8%. Thesefigures were about equal until 1984, when Japan suddenlyincreased its investment rate.   The problem is not the amount of saving and investment buttheir applications. The U.S. is wealthy and can afford tomake large investments in defense and residentialconstruction. In addition, the U.S. made the politicaldecision to raise the standard of living of its elderly andalmost tripled Social Security taxes during the past decade.While important, these expenditures do not increase ournation's productive capabilities. Until recently, Japan hasnot been wealthy enough to defend itself, and being land-poorits citizens do not put comparable time and money intoresidential construction. As a result, Japan's investmentshave been directed toward areas that do increase futureproductive capabilities. The two nations must understand thecauses for their different economic-growth rates. Decisionsmust be made over the next decade to ensure that these growthrates eventually converge. Competitive cooperation and notadversarial animosity must rule.
