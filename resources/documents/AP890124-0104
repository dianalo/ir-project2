(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An evangelist whom Jessica Hahn said sheturned to for solace following her sexual encounter with ousted PTLleader Jim Bakker pleaded guilty today to two of 18 counts againsthim.   The guilty pleas by Long Island minister Eugene Profeta came ashis trial on state tax evasion, perjury and witness tamperingcharges was about to start in state Supreme Court.   Profeta pleaded guilty to offering a false instrument for filing,his 1986 tax return, and to tampering with a witness, Hahn. Underthe plea-bargain agreement, he will be sentenced to six months injail and five years probation. He'll also be fined $5,000 andordered to pay $13,000 in state taxes.   As part of the deal, Profeta also was ordered not to have anycontact with Hahn, his former church secretary.   The surprise pleas ended a suppression hearing being held todetermine if transcripts of taped telephone conversations betweenProfeta and Hahn, made with her consent, could be used at the trial.   Revelations about Hahn's 1980 sexual encounter with Bakker led tohis ouster by the religious group.   On Monday, a New York state investigator testified that Hahn toldhim she had a cocaine habit and had received $12,000 in ``hushmoney'' from the PTL ministry in what ``sounded like extortion.''   Hahn said she used $7,000 to buy cocaine sometime after gettingtwo payments from the PTL ministry, said Richard Friedman, aninvestigator for the state attorney general's office.   Friedman testified in a suppression hearing on evidence forProfeta's trial.   Friedman testified that Hahn told him that one of her closefriends wrote a letter to the PTL ministry asking for $100,000 notto talk about an alleged rape by Bakker.   Hahn told him that she had a cocaine habit in 1984 and 1985 andalso had a dependence on the drug Fiorinal, Friedman testified.</TEXT></DOC>
