This announcementis the complete solicitation document and no other document for this workis available. The objective of this program is the execution of one ormore cooperative agreements to conduct research and development of thistechnology leading to improvements in industrial drying efficiencies. Upto three-fourths of the energy used for drying may be saved by recoveringthe latent heat of vaporization. This technology permits that recoveryto be made by compressing the exhaust steam from the dryer to a higherpressure with a mechanically driven compressor. The compressor producesa temperature increase along with the pressure increase. Recovery of thelatent heat of vaporization is enhanced by excluding as much air as possiblefrom the dryer, significantly improving the heat transfer coefficient ofthe condensing steam. The use of either a reheat boiler or a desuperheaterin a proposed concept is acceptable if appropriate for the particular typeof application, and if such use has potential for significant nationwideutilization. The applicant should describe the proposed concept thoroughlyin the application. The description should present convincing argumentsas to the technical feasibility and utility of the concept, and shouldexplain the beneficial and advantageous aspects that will enhance the potentialfor widespread implementation of the concept. Proposals should focus ona specific product or products, and development should include both overallsystem concepts and design of individual components. An explanation isrequired of how this concept is applicable to other processes and products.Product heat sensitivity in a steam atmosphere is perceived as being differentfrom that in air, and may have a significant effect on actual energy savings.Energy savings may be achieved either by using the compressed exhaust steamto partially power the drying process or by showing where in the overallprocess of producing the product the energy may be used. A wide varietyof dryer types and dried products are considered candidates for this technology.The allowable research and development activities may be nominally dividedinto three phases: <T3>Phase I_Feasibility Investigation</T3>-applied research to evaluateindustrial applicability, explore system configurations, design systemelements, and conduct appropriate laboratory testing to provide technicaland economic feasibility confirmation and an updated energy savings estimate.<T3>Phase II_Engineering Development</T3>_additional laboratory testing,system design, construction, and pilot scale testing/evaluation to documenttechnical performance and predict the energy and economic performance ofa full-scale system.<T3>Phase III_Proof-of-Principle-Testing</T3>_full or major-scale systemtesting and evaluation to confirm in-service performance and operabilityand to finalize energy, economic, and environmental analyses. The proposermay initiate activities in any of the above phases provided that completionof any previous phase(s) can be demonstrated.Funding of subsequent phases will depend on the results of the initialwork, the availability of funding, the DOE program requirements, and theability to reach a mutual agreement on scope and cost-sharing. All projectswill be cost-shared by DOE and the Participant, with the Participant'scost-share increasing as the project proceeds through the various phases.No fee or profit will be paid to the Participant.DOE anticipates that approximately $500,000 will be available for supportof initial phase activities, and that this solicitation will result inone or more cooperative agreements. Negotiation, award, and administrationwill be in accordance with DOE Financial Assistance Regulations (10 CFRPart 600). The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for this programis 81.078.Profit making entities, individuals, educational institutions, nonprofitinstitutions and other entities are eligible to submit applications inresponse to this solicitation. Federal agencies and/or laboratories owned,operated, or under the cognizance of the Federal Government are not eligiblefor award and should not submit applications. Applications which anticipateparticipation of such a laboratory by subcontract, use agreement, or otherarrangement must include satisfactory evidence of specific authorizationfrom the cognizant Federal agency.All proposals received within 10 CFR 600.13 Application Deadlines willbe evaluated and point-scored in accordance with the following four evaluationcriteria:<T3>Criterion 1 </T3>is the technical viability and applicability of theconcept. This criterion is divided into two parts and must include a detaileddescription of the concept showing innovative aspects, development status,how it will be adopted in industry and the energy savings. The energy valueof industrial drying in the U.S. has been estimated to be approximately1.5 x 10\15\ Btu/year, or about 5.5 percent of U.S. industrial energy consumption.The proposed concept should be shown to have at least a nominal net energysavings potential on a national basis of 10\12\ Btu/year, together withattractive economic and environmental features. In this context, net energysavings is defined as energy conserved relative to present drying practicesby utilizing superheated steam drying, less any energy expense associatedwith process modification, expressed in Btu per product unit. The nationalnet energy savings is estimated by multiplying the unit energy savingsby the total number of units estimated to be produced annually in the U.S.and by the estimated percent market share where the process innovationmay be implemented. (All assumptions should be stated and discussed.)<T3>Criterion 1a </T3>is technical viability of the proposed technology(s).Factors considered favorable are high feasibility of the technology(s);low development cost and time needed to proceed to a commerical products(s);and high advancement of the technology relative to other systems commerciallyavailable or currently under development in terms of the potential forachieving energy savings, product cost reductions, and quality improvements.<T3>Criterion 1b </T3>is the applicability of the concept. Factors to beconsidered favorable are the identity of products and specific industrialapplications where a high potential for use exists within industry; theestimated number of applications projected; and the market share and associatedenergy savings based on the proposers projections for implementation ona national basis.<T3>Criterion 2 </T3>is the Statement of Work; it shall be evaluated relativeto clarity, completeness, responsiveness, and adequacy to accomplish theproject objectives. A description shall be provided for the complete project(all phases). A statement of objectives (what is to be accomplished) anda detailed Statement of Work (specific tasks and subtasks to accomplishthe objectives) are required for the proposed initial phase. For subsequentphases, the objectives shall be stated and the work outlined to indicatehow the objectives will be accomplished. The work effort may be startedin any of the three phases.Conclusive evidence should be presented showing the conduct and conclusionsof the previous phase(s) of work.<T3>Criterion 3</T3> is the ability of the proposer to successfully completeall phases of the project. Factors to be considered are the proposer'sgeneral knowledge of industrial drying technologies plus specific knowledgeof the proposed technology for industrial drying; the proposed industrialapplication; market factors affecting acceptance by industry of an industrialdryer using superheated steam with exhaust recompression; the facilitiesavailable for building and testing the proposed concept; qualificationsof the key individuals and the percentage of their time devoted to theproject; background on the proposer's marketing channels for related lines;and facilities and personnel for production and commercialization.Annual financial statements (balance sheet and income and expense statements)for the past three years shall be attached for the applicant, subcontractors,consulting firms, and other principals composing the project team. Whereavailable, financial statements prepared by certified public accountantsshould be submitted. If plant owners, or subcontractors, or consultantsare not involved in the initial phase, they must submit their annual FinancialStatements prior to involvement in later phases.<T3>Criterion 4 </T3>is the project managaement plan. A project managementplan is required that shows how the proposed work is to be managed.The plan shall be evaluated relative to the completeness and adequacy ofthe work breakdown structure, the schedule (sequence of project tasks),individual responsibilities and task assignments of each project participant,estimates of personnel effort for each of the tasks, resource and manpoweravailability to satisfy task requirements, project management methods tocomplete the project in a timely manner and control over budget, schedule,and product quality shall be described. A more general schedule for futurephases is also required.Applications shall be responsive to all the above criteria. The criteriaare listed in descending order of importance. Criterion 1 is approximatelyfour-tenths the total evaluation criteria value. Criterion 1a is abouttwice the value of Criterion 1b. Criterion 2 is about three-tenths thetotal value, and Criterion 3 and 4 are of equal value and together areapproximately three-tenths the total value.Cost considerations will not be point-scored or adjectively rated. Theproposed cost is a function of the management approach, the technical approach,the manpower, the facilities, the organization, the uncertainties of thework, the proposer's competitive strategy, and the economy. The cost considerationwill not be an addition to the cumulative score of ratings resulting fromthe evaluation. Applicants are advised, however, that notwithstanding thelower relative importance of the cost considerations, the evaluated costmay be the basis for selection.The initial phase is not expected to exceed 12 months; all applicants arerequired to submit an annual budget provided in detailed breakdown, aspart of the applicant's cost proposal. In making the selection decision,the apparent advantages of individual technical and business applicationswill be weighed against the evaluated probable cost to determine whetherbetter applications, excluding cost considerations are worth the evaluatedprobable cost differences. When applications are very closely ranked andthe Source Selection Official determines that the superiority in the technicaland business aspects of the higher related application(s) is not meaningfulwhen viewed in relationship to lower rated applications, evaluated probablecosts to the Government may form the basis for selection.In conducting the evaluation of applications, the Government may utilizeassistance and advice from non-Government personnel. Applicants that donot consent to the use of non-Government personnel in evaluating theirproposal(s) are required to make that statement on the cover of their application(s).Applicants are further advised that DOE may be unable to give full considerationto an applicant submitted without such consent. Information contained inthe applications shall be treated in accordance with the policies and proceduresset forth in 10 CFR 600.18.DOE reserves the right to reject any and all applications received in responseto this solicitation or to select any application as a basis for negotiation.DOE may require applications to be clarified or supplemented either throughadditional written submissions or oral presentations; however, the awardmay be made solely on the information contained in the proposal. The Governmentis not liable for any costs incurred in the preparation of an application.Further, costs incurred prior to the signing of a cooperative agreementare not reimbursable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Program Policy and Preference Factors</ITAG>The Source Selection official may make selections for negotiations andsubsequent awards in a manner that will further the objectives of DOE,considering the following policy factors:(1) The degree of innovation represented by the concept for utilizationof Superheated Steam Drying with Exhaust Recompression. It is desirableto develop either new or creative technologies or to develop unique applicationsof existing technology in this area. Proposals will not be selected foraward which are duplicative of research and development already accomplishedor underway in private industry.(2) The priority of the potential energy savings. Recovery and conversionfor material or fuel substitution is of highest priority if the energysavings are from displacement of petroleum; the next highest if from displacementof natural gas; and lowest for displacement of coal or renewable materialsby a particular proposal.(3) Total funds available considering the funds required by a particularproposal; and(4) The desirability of selecting, for award or support, a group of projectswhich represents a diversity of methods, approaches, applications, or kindsof work.(5) The desirability to support development of concepts when the potentialbenefits are high with relatively little Government expenditure.Stevens Amendment to the DOD Appropriations Act:<ITAG tagnum="21">When issuing statements, press releases, requests for proposals, bidsolicitations, and other documents describing projects or programs fundedin whole or in part with Federal money, all grantees receiving Federalfunds including but not limited to State and local Governments shall clearlystate: (1) The percentage of the total cost of the program or project,which will be financed with Federal money, and (2) the dollar amount ofFederal funds for the project or program.</ITAG>Instructions for Certification1.
