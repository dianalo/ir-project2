Kraig Kendall, president of Kandamp;T Homes, Inc., told aninvestigative panel of the Senate Select Committee on Indian affairsthat the government's policy of requiring companies to have 51percent Indian ownership to win Indian-related contracts was ``aninvitation for fraud and fronts.''   He also said his practice of giving gifts ranging from dinnerhams to expensive sports cars to Indian officials was standardprocedure among those seeking construction contracts on lands of theAbsentee Shawnee and Chickasaw tribes.   Kendall, who pleaded guilty in 1985 to charges related to bribinga Chickasaw governor, said contracting now ``is in a shambles.''   ``Developers are all going to say we would prefer to go in andbid on a competitive basis. I tried to do that.'' Kendall said.   But he said he was unable to get contracts that way and soonresorted to gifts and gratuities.   ``In some cases some serious bribes,'' he said.   ``Initially, I wined and dined them and gave them small presentslike turkeys and hams,'' Kendall said of his experience withofficials of the Absentee Shawnee housing authority.   He said he offered the chairman of the authority _ and later thechairman of the tribe _ tickets to University of Oklahoma footballgames.   After sending the two men to the Orange Bowl with about $500 incash and paid hotel reservations, Kendall said he received acontract for a 50-unit housing project on Absentee Shawnee lands.   Eventually, Kendall said he made a deal to kick back $500 onevery housing unit he built and gave a recreational van and aPorsche as a means of continuing his contracting.   Kendall described similar dealings with housing and tribalofficials of the Chickasaw nation, saying he paid $94,000 on phonyinvoices from the tribal governor's construction supplymanufacturing company in order to get $14 million in contracts.   The tribal governor, Overton James, pleaded guilty in Oklahomaearlier this month to accepting kickbacks and has been sentenced toprison.   Kendall also said that in order to participate in bidding for thecontracts he made an employee's wife who had an Indian relative inher ancestry a 51 percent owner of his company.   ``She was a housewife,'' he said. He said she never participatedin company business except to sign papers.   The committee began its hearings into corruption in Indianaffairs Monday and has been concentrating on the ``front''operations.   Donald Asbra, chief of the contracting division of the Bureau ofIndian Affairs, testified that the agency accepts the contractors'word that they are majority Indian-owned and does not investigate.   He said it is up to the Indians to police themselves and thatthey can complain to the BIA if they believe business that issupposed to go to native Americans is going to non-Indians.   ``We don't have the capacity to inspect fronts,'' said Asbra.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who chairs the investigativepanel, asked if cases involving suspected fronts could be stopped byBIA officials at the local level. Asbra said that was possible.   The committee will be gathering information for several weeks onalleged corruption in many facets of Indian affairs, includinggaming, law enforcement, education and possible sex abuse ofchildren.   At one point, the committee went into private session to heartestimony from Richard Ramirez, who, as former head of a Navyprogram for small and disadvantaged business utilization, said hehad counseled participants in a minority set-aside programestablished by the Small Business Administration.   Among those he counseled was Kinross Manufacturing Co.   According to a statement released by the committee staff, Ramireztold the panel that Kinross, a Michigan firm that manufacturesmunitions, was an Indian front company controlled by wealthybusinessmen, including some with connections to Wedtech, ascandal-plagued Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor.   Ramirez has pleaded guilty to accepting a bribe in connectionwith the Wedtech affair and is cooperating with the federalgovernment in cases related to SBA contractors.   He said Kinross used one man as the applicant for admittance tothe minority program, though until 1982 the man was not enrolled inany Indian tribe.   Kinross applied for, and received minority certification and thenwon multi-million dollar government contracts.   Ramirez said he had never seen a start-up company supported by somany government loans.</TEXT></DOC>
