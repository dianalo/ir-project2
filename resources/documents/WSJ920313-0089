A spokesman for Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C., groupof investors including former U.S. defense secretary FrankCarlucci, said yesterday that it and the French electronicsconcern Thomson S.A. are &quot;considering whether we should makea bid&quot; with the U.S. bankruptcy court that is managing LTV'saffairs.</LP><TEXT>   In Bethesda, Md., a Martin Marietta spokesman said it andLockheed plan to ask the bankruptcy court in New York todayfor $5 million plus $7 million in expenses if their purchaseagreement is rejected. &quot;We're simply seeking some protectionfor ourselves and Lockheed,&quot; the spokesman said.   Lockheed, based in Calabasas, Calif., and Martin Mariettasigned a definitive agreement with LTV late last month to buyits missile and aircraft units for $319 million in cash and$36 million in preferred stock.   Dallas-based LTV, which has been operating under Chapter11 bankruptcy-court protection against creditors since 1986,has been selling assets to raise cash for such purposes assettling its steel unit's $3.1 billion pension liabilities.   But although the agreement has been signed, the sale toLockheed and Martin Marietta is far from wrapped up, and someindustry observers expect a Thomson-Carlyle bid. One personfamiliar with the situation said the competing bid beingconsidered is about $400 million, and that theThomson-Carlyle interests probably would split up theaircraft and missile operations of what is now LTV.   Among the businesses are subcontract work for NorthropCorp.'s B-2 Stealth bomber and McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s C17military transport, a variety of commercial aircraft, and theArmy's Multiple Launch Rocket System and Advanced TacticalMissile System, along with some classified technologies.   The possibility of acquisitions involving LTV's &quot;black&quot;classified technologies by Thomson, a Frenchgovernment-subsidized concern, has raised concern on CapitolHill. Late last month, Rep. Martin Frost, a Texas Democrat,sent a letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney expressingconcern over a competing LTV bid by a foreign-owned company.Democratic Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas is circulating aletter to President Bush that asks for presidential review ofany Thomson-Carlyle purchase due to concerns over U.S.economic security and sensitive technology transfer, aspokeswoman for the senator said.   Martin Marietta said its own lobbying isn't to fanprotectionist sentiment in Washington, although the companyspokesman acknowledged it has &quot;relied on some politicalconsultants&quot; to respond to questions about the implicationsof a ThomsonCarlyle bid. &quot;We've taken our cue from thosekinds of queries. We have made materials available to otherswho haven't necessarily asked us,&quot; he said.   Under the Lockheed-Martin Marietta arrangement with LTV,which must receive bankruptcy court approval, the twoaerospace concerns would operate the missiles and aircraftbusinesses of LTV as a new company named Vought Corp., afterthe founder of that aircraft business.   Filings with the bankruptcy court must be made by March25, with a final hearing scheduled on April 1 on the proposedsale to Lockheed and Martin Marietta.   Separately, in Dallas, LTV said its missile divisionreceived a $42.7 million contract to produce the U.S. Army'smultiple launch rocket system.   LTV added that the contract is the final incremental awardfor the fourth year of a five-year, $1.2 billion contract, tobe completed by January 1994.</TEXT></DOC>
