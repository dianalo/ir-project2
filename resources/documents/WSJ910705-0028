Some analysts think that, barring an unforeseen weather oreconomic disaster, cotton's glory days are over for thisyear. &quot;The kind of historical event that we've had since lastyear, that kind of huge move is certainly over,&quot; said ErnestSimon, cotton specialist at Prudential Securities. &quot;We're notgoing to see that again in this season.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The lone bull market among commodities in recent months,cotton prices ran up this spring to their highest level in 11years as traders and cotton users grew increasingly concernedabout dwindling supplies. But in the past six weeks, cottonprices have plummeted: Cotton for July delivery fell to aslow as 69.1 cents a pound on Monday, 27% off itslife-of-contract high of 94.45 cents, set on May 21.   On Wednesday, July cotton finished at 71.18 cents a pound,up 0.05 cent. December cotton rose 0.44 cent to 71.08 cents.   Partly behind the recent decline was the appearance of alarge amount of cotton for delivery against the Julycontract. But the more serious blow was struck by anAgriculture Department report last week that showed morecotton acreage planted this spring than expected.   Sharon Johnson, cotton specialist at Cargill InvestorServices, declines to call the bull market dead, saying it&quot;has been wounded, but not mortally wounded.&quot; Ending stocksnext year will still be uncomfortably low, she said, whichwill support prices. But cotton prices aren't likely toapproach their highs again this year, she agreed.   O.A. Cleveland, an economist with Mississippi StateUniversity and a cotton consultant, still sees life in thebull market. The new crop is &quot;poised for significantproblems&quot; arising from the planting delays this spring in theMississippi Delta region, he explained.   Because about half the crop was planted as much as threeweeks late, there are concerns that the cotton won't haveenough time to mature before cool, wet weather hits inSeptember and October, he said.   Moreover, Mr. Cleveland believes the AgricultureDepartment's estimate of planted acres is too high. At thetime the government conducted its survey in early June, manyof the delta farmers still hadn't completed their planting,so they estimated their final acreage, Mr. Cleveland said.About 300,000 to 400,000 acres that farmers had intended forcotton weren't planted because of bad weather, he said.   Mr. Cleveland predicts October cotton will rise to thehigh 70s and possibly above 80 cents. He foresees Decembercotton returning to the mid-70s.   In other commodity markets on Wednesday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork-belly futures prices declinedfor the third consecutive day, still pressured by agovernment report that showed unexpectedly high production ofpork. Because of the U.S. Agriculture Department's hogs andpigs report, released last Friday, pork-belly futures openeddown the daily limit of two cents and then stopped trading onboth Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday the contract traded allday, but its price declined on general bearish sentiment andselling ahead of the July 4 holiday. The price of thepork-belly contract for August delivery fell 0.62 cents apound to settle at 43.02 cents a pound. Cattle futures pricesalso fell, mostly on disappointment about cattle sales inTexas and continuing weakness in the price of beef. TheAugust cattle contract settled down 0.65 cents at 72.42 centsa pound.                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude and product futures prices settled lower inlargely featureless, pre-holiday trading on the New YorkMercantile Exchange. Traders said the session was one ofprofit-taking as a means of squaring positions before theIndependence Day holiday. The exchange was closed yesterdayfor the holiday and many participants are taking today off tomake a long weekend. Gasoline was weakened Wednesday bybearish inventory figures released late Tuesday. The AmericanPetroleum Industry figures showed gasoline stocks rising1,188,000 barrels to 219,167,000 barrels in the week endedlast Friday. Crude stocks were shown falling 4,861,000barrels to 349,128,000 barrels.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices fell. Copper for September deliveryended 1.9 cents a pound lower at $1.0155. One of the smallerunions at Codelco's Chuquicamata mine in Chile postponed itsstrike, which some traders read as a sign of things to come,said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst at PaineWebber.William O'Neill, futures strategist at Merrill Lynch, addedthat contributing to the decline were reports late Wednesdaythat Codelco had much less copper scheduled for shipment thanexpected. It appears Codelco had anticipated the strike andkept commitments for July at a low level to avoid supplydisruptions, he said. The copper market will continue to bevolatile as long as the strike continues, he said. Investorsshouldn't lose sight of the fact that demand for copper stillisn't buoyant, Mr. O'Neill said, and prices could fall afterthe strike is settled.</TEXT></DOC>
