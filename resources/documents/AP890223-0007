The finding may also lead to the first definitive test fordiagnosing Alzheimer's in a living patient, said study co-authorBarbara Talamo.   Alzheimer experts agreed that studying the nerve tissue mayreveal secrets about the brain disease, for which no cause or cureis known. But they were skeptical that the tissue, which can beremoved under local anesthetic, would be useful for a diagnostictest.   Talamo is director of the neurosciences program at Tufts MedicalSchool, and associate professor of neurology and physiology at theschool and the New England Medical Center, both in Boston.   She describes the new research in today's issue of the Britishjournal Nature with colleagues there and scientists from HarvardMedical School and the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative illness thatimpairs memory, thinking and behavior. It afflicts an estimated 2.5million Americans.   The new study focused on nerves found at the top of the nosewithin the inner lining, where they are responsible for detectingodors. The nerves extend threadlike projections into a portion ofthe brain that is affected by Alzheimer's disease, Talamo said.   Researchers took nerve tissue samples from autopsies of nineAlzheimer's patients. For comparison purposes, they also samplednasal tissue from autopsies of nine people of about the same agesbut without similar disease, and five people who had other braindiseases.   Eight of the nine Alzheimer samples showed marked production ofnerve fibers called neurites that contained abnormal proteins. Theproteins were excessively modified by a chemical process calledphosphorylation.   The proteins resembled those found in the brains of Alzheimer'spatients, in tangled structures within brain cells that are ahallmark of the disease, Talamo said.   In contrast, samples from only two of the 14 comparison patientsshowed significant amounts of the abnormal fibers, and a thirdshowed a small amount.   Those three people were among seven non-Alzheimer subjects olderthan 65, noted David Drachman of the University of Massachusetts.   Since the fibers appeared in three of the seven, they may bepresent in many people older than 65 who do not have Alzheimer's, hesaid. That raises questions about the fibers' usefulness indiagnosing the disease, he said.   Peter Davies of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx,N.Y., also said it is not known whether samples from living patientswould be useful for diagnosis. Talamo said researchers plan to beginstudies in living people.   Drachman and Davies did say that laboratory studies of nasalnerve tissue from Alzheimer patients may help in learning about thedisease. But Drachman said it depends on whether the tissue willshow more convincing evidence that it reflects the Alzheimer'sdisease process.</TEXT></DOC>
