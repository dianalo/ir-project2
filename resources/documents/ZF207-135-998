(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Lisa SpiegelmanandM;and Laura BrennanandM;PC manufacturers readying computers compatible with IBM's Micro Channelarchitecture (MCA) will likely find it tough to sell their machines ascompetition within their ranks and a lack of interest among buyers detractsfrom potential sales, according to corporate users.andM;GRiD Systems Corp., of Irvine, Calif., recently became the latest firm toannounce an MCA machine.andP;  GRiD's new 20MHz, 80386 MCA compatible, based onthe MCA clone that Tandy Corp. introduced last year.andM;At Comdex/Spring next month, Olivetti USA is expected to announce itsMCA-compatible PC, while other firms such as Advanced Logic Research Inc. andAmerican Mitac Corp., will soon begin shipping their MCA machines, accordingto officials at those companies.andP;  Apricot Computers plc., a British firm, hasbeen selling its Qi Series of MCA compatibles in the United States sinceJanuary.andM;Paradox of InterestandM;Despite their efforts, MCA-compatibles makers may find themselves in aparadoxical situation as they attempt to sell their wares.andP;  Corporate buyerswho have invested in the Micro Channel tend to be loyal IBM customers withlittle interest in clones, while buyers without a bias toward IBM have shownlittle interest in MCA.andM;General Accident Insurance Co., for instance, is unlikely to be lured by MCAcompatibles from any vendor, even though the firm has standardized on MCAcomputers, said Michael Corey, team leader for data communications at thePhiladelphia firm.andM;''We like IBM's one-stop shop for hardware and software,'' he said.andP;  ''Thatway, when we have a support question, there's no pointing fingers and havinga vendor walk away from problems.''andM;Greg Barbu, information-center analyst at Rubbermaid Inc. of Wooster, Ohio,also plans to stick with IBM.andP;  ''We don't buy clones because the othervendors can't offer the service and support like IBM.andP;  It's not just thehardware.''andM;On the other hand, compatibles manufacturers must convince users that haven'tstandardized on MCA that the architecture is worth buying in the first place.andM;''We're still looking for an advantage to the Micro Channel,'' said DonSmith, a partner and national coordinator of microcomputing consulting forthe Chicago Big 8 accounting firm Price Waterhouse.andP;  ''We've bought some MCAmachines, but only because we liked the performance of the Model 50s.andP;  We'donly look at MCA compatibles insofar as they're PCs with '286 or '386processors and have enough memory to run our applications.''andM;In addition to selling MCA's technical merits, makers of MCA compatibles arecompeting against the current industry standard architecture and willeventually market their machines against the Extended Industry StandardArchitecture (EISA).andM;Despite these potential drawbacks, MCA clone manufacturers can find hope infigures from StoreBoard Inc. that show Micro Channel machines slowly gainingground in corporate America.andP;  At the end of 1988, more than a half-millionMCA-based PS/2s from IBM had been installed, according to the Dallasmarket-research firm.andP;  IBM claims to have shipped twice as many MCA machinesto dealers by year's end.andM;MCA clone vendors say they are confident of weakening IBM's foothold withbetter pricing and performance.andM;''The market for MCA computers consists of corporate customers that havestandardized on MCA and that have realized they will run the risk of beingcontrolled by IBM,'' said Keddy Chen, marketing manager for American Mitac,in San Jose, Calif.andP;  ''It happened this way in the AT market, and it canhappen again.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
