(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Emhart Corp.'s board of directors rejectedan investment group's unsolicited $2.4 billion takeover offerThursday and the company said it had received rival buyout bids fromother parties.   Peter L. Scott, Emhart's chairman and chief executive officer,recommended shareholders not tender any of their stock to TopperAcquisition Corp. and raised questions about unusual movements inEmhart's stock price before the group's bid.   ``This trading raises disquieting questions as to whether thegovernment's actions aimed at curbing insider trading on non-publicinformation have been effective,'' Scott said in a letter toshareholders.   Topper, whose investors include oil heir Gordon P. Getty and NewYork developers Lawrence and Zachary Fisher, offered $35 a share forEmhart on Feb. 24.   A spokesman for Topper, who asked that his name not be used, saidthe investment group would have no immediate comment on Emhart'saction or the allegations of insider trading.   Emhart stock rose 37{ cents to $42.37{ a share Thursday in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading.   The shares traded at $32.75 a share when Topper tendered itsoffer. The stock had risen almost $10 a share in the month prior tothe offer amid takeover rumors.   It was not known whether the federal government was looking intothe movement in Emhart's shares. Chiles Larson, a Securities andExchange Commission spokesman, said it was the agency's policy notto comment on possible investigations.   Meanwhile, Emhart, a Farmington-based manufacturer of a varietyof consumer and industrial products, said it had discussed with ``alimited number of third parties'' a possible buyout of the firm. Thecompany did not identify the other parties.   Spokesman Michael Claes said the board gave preliminaryconsideration to the offers at meetings on Feb. 28 and Wednesday.   Emhart said it was also exploring other alternatives to theTopper bid, including a financial restructuring or recapitalization.   In his letter to shareholders, Scott said Emhart's financialadvisers, Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co. and Shearson Lehman HuttonInc., advised the company's board the Topper bid was ``inadequatefrom a financial point of view.''   Scott said the board also took into consideration the company'srestructuring effort, which began in 1986, and four recentacquisitions.   ``The board believes that the full benefits of the company'sstrategies have yet to be realized and that Emhart is in a positionto continue to build on the favorable results achieved over the pasttwo years,'' Scott said.   ``Accordingly, the board does not believe that now is anopportune time to sell the company,'' he said.   Emhart's products include lawn and garden equipment, hardware andmaterials used to make footwear.   Topper has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Richmond,Va., to block the use of Emhart's ``poison pill'' anti-takeoverdefense. Emhart has countersued and Scott said the company wouldamend the plan to eliminate a provision challenged by Topper.</TEXT></DOC>
