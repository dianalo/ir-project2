But the United States must do more, including increasing itsspending for anti-poaching measures in Africa, according to Bohlenand other conservationists testifying before the House Subcommitteeon Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation.   ``It has been bitterly disappointing to me to see how littlemoney Congress has appropriated to the African ElephantConservation Fund: a paltry $350,000 for this fiscal year,'' Bohlensaid.   ``That amount will not save many elephants,'' he added.   Witnesses said worldwide recognition of the plight of theAfrican elephant has begun to have an impact on poaching, which hasbeen decimating the population for years. Agreements by the UnitedStates and Japan to ban ivory imports and anti-poaching actions inAfrica have been crucial to the effort.   Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., who chairs the subcommittee, saidmerely declaring the elephant an endangered species is not enough.   ``Our goal is not simply to save a few elephants here and therefor zoos and parks,'' Studds said. ``Our objective must be torestore elephant populations; to work with the internationalcommunity and with the nations of Africa to bring those populationsback up to sustainable levels; to provide a source of income forcountries in desperate need of revenue.''   Witnesses said that the banning of ivory trade has in someinstances already had an impact on poaching by reducing the marketfor ivory.   ``The absence of market demand and stepped-up enforcementefforts have combined to greatly reduce the toll on elephants,''Bohlen said. ``Ivory presently has no value in Tanzania where 1,840poachers and traders have been arrested. Incredibly, tusks havebeen found washing down the Ruaha River, dumped by culprits who nolonger can sell them.''   Susan Lieberman of the Humane Society of the United States saiddisagreements among African countries _ some of which do notconsider their elephant populations endangered _ must be settledbefore more progress can be made.   She also said steps must be taken to curb recreational huntingdespite arguments that costly hunting licenses provide revenue toprotect elephant herds.   Nevertheless, Lieberman said the international agreements onbanning trade and helping to fight poaching mark significantprogress in the past year.   ``The African Elephant has been granted a cease-fire,''Lieberman said.</TEXT></DOC>
