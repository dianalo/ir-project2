The influences of stress and sputter damage havepreviously been investigated for H{sub 2}S adsorption on iron, and thispaper reports the extension of the work to H{sub 2}O on iron. Auger electronspectroscopy (AES) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) examinationof water adsorption on polycrystalline and (110) iron show that the saturationcoverage of oxygen is not altered by ion beam damage, but that the adsorptionrate can be increased by more than a factor of ten. These results aresimilar to those found for H{sub 2}S and have been interpreted in termsof a precursor adsorption model. 2 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
