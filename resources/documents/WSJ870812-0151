Thus, when Katsumi Sezaki, Japan's consul general in Pretoria, found out not long ago that Japan had pulled into a virtual tie with the U.S. for that distinction, he knew he had to take a stand. Either the Nippon Club to which he belonged would strike from its charter a clause advocating closer trade ties between the two countries, or he would resign from the business group and its monthly golf outings.    He resigned. &quot;I needed to send a message to the Japanese businessmen here,&quot; says Mr. Sezaki, whose government is trying to enforce sanctions on the white-ruled nation. &quot;We don't promote trade with South Africa.&quot;    The showdown at the Nippon Club reflects Japan's precarious relationship with South Africa, which has become all the more delicate with the wave of international sanctions and American corporate disinvestments. On the one hand, Japan actively courts a high profile in South Africa: Toyota, Mazda and Nissan cars crowd the streets; Japanese-brand computers and office machines are commonplace; Nikon cameras, Sony televisions and Seiko watches are symbols of affluence. Japanese buyers are well known to coal, platinum and gold producers.    But on the other hand, Japan is trying to hide. It is clearly embarrassed over the prospect of supplanting the U.S. as South Africa's top trading partner. &quot;Nobody notices when you're No. 2 or 3,&quot; says a Japanese diplomat. &quot;But No. 1 -- no, we can't have that.&quot;    And Japanese corporate executives, though they like the extra business they're getting, don't want to be seen as capitalizing on America's and Europe's pullback from South Africa. &quot;Almost all of the Japanese companies doing business here have important relations with the United States,&quot; says a second Japanese diplomat. &quot;They don't want to harm them by undermining anything the U.S. is doing here.&quot;    Adds Keisuke Sogo, the deputy general manager of the Johannesburg unit of C. Itoh andamp; Co., the Japanese trading concern: &quot;We already have enough problems with America because of the trade imbalance between Japan and the U.S.&quot;    Mr. Sogo, who is also the organizer of the Nippon Club golf outings, ponders this thought and says maybe the club should drop its &quot;promotion of trade&quot; clause. &quot;We are very nervous,&quot; he says.    Since World War II, Japan's relations with South Africa have posed a dilemma. Politically, government relations have been kept to a consul-general, rather than ambassadorial, level. Socially, the Japanese claim apartheid's color and privilege scheme places them in limbo, somewhere between white and black. (A Japanese diplomat says that for purposes of apartheid's bookkeeping, Japanese have been accorded &quot;honorary white&quot; status and are allowed to live in white housing areas. A South African government spokesman, however, says there has never been a special classification for the Japanese.)    But economically, South Africa offers an inviting market. The whites' high standard of living is ideal for the range of Japanese consumer items. And the black population provides a huge potential market.    &quot;We see the market currently depending on the white population, but we hope in the future it will spread to the non-whites,&quot; says Hideki Kato, a Nissan Motor Co. representative in South Africa. &quot;A total population of over 30 million is a big potential.&quot;    But what is potential to Japanese business is plague to the Japanese government. &quot;The over-presence of Japanese products is a worry to the government,&quot; Mr. Kato says. &quot;We cannot be happy without thinking about politics.&quot;    Over the years, Tokyo has tried to keep a lid on trade with South Africa. Direct investment by Japanese firms has been prohibited for two decades. More recently, the government has imposed sanctions against the importation of iron and steel. It has banned the sale of computers to the government and the police. And it has cut all cultural and tourism ties; not even South African golfer Gary Player, who is beloved in Japan, is allowed to visit.    Yet trade is booming. Tokyo is reluctant to cut off imports of coal and other raw materials, though it has told companies to look for alternative supplies. And as the South African economy creeps out of a recession, demand for Japanese consumer products is growing.    In 1986, Japan's trade with South Africa declined in yen terms, but soared in U.S. dollar terms. According to Japanese government figures, exports to South Africa amounted to $1.36 billion and imports to $2.23 billion, for a total trade of $3.59 billion, up from $2.86 billion in 1985.    By comparison, U.S. trade with South Africa last year totaled $3.64 billion, up from $3.38 billion, according to U.S. Commerce Department figures. American exports amounted to $1.16 billion and imports to $2.48 billion.    For this year, both the U.S. and Japan are predicting slight declines in trade volume with South Africa, as is the South African Foreign Trade Organization. But in the battle to avoid being No. 1, it's a matter of whose trade falls more.    The Japanese government has told businessmen it would like to see South African trade scaled back to 1985 levels. But that's easier said than done, because many Japanese products are firmly entrenched in the South African market.    In this sense, the &quot;no direct investment&quot; policy has backfired. Instead of making their own products here, as many American and European companies do, Japanese companies have franchised the production to South African owners. For instance, while Toyota Motor Corp. doesn't build its own cars in South Africa, it sells parts to the local franchise, which, in turn, builds and sells Toyota vehicles. In this manner, Japanese auto makers have captured 60% of the South African car and truck market; Toyota is the individual leader with about 28%.    Thus, Japanese companies have been spared the disinvestment pressure experienced by their American and European counterparts. &quot;The Japanese have gotten the market without having the risk of direct investment, like the Americans and Europeans,&quot; says a Johannesburg auto industry analyst.    But, say Japanese businessmen, doing business this way -- by proxy, rather than in person -- isn't as much fun. Kuniyasu Kobayashi, the director of the Japanese Export Trade Organization in South Africa, feels like a fish out of water. In all the other countries where it operates, the government agency is active in promoting trade; in South Africa, Mr. Kobayashi is basically a filing clerk, compiling and relaying statistics and information to Tokyo. He hasn't been to a trade fair during his three years in Johannesburg.    &quot;Some people think my job is just to collect information, send it to Japan and then think about playing golf,&quot; he says. About the golf: It's rarely with the Nippon Club, he says. </TEXT></DOC>
