The notice further provided that any requestfor a hearing on this question should be accompanied by a statement summarizingthe reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing,identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizingthe evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how theparty commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.The National Armored Car Association (``Protestant''), Seattle, Washington,has submitted written comments in opposition to approval of the application.Protestant contends that the proposed armored car activities are not closelyrelated to banking, and challenges whether banks or bank holding companiesgenerally engage in armored car services. Protestant further contends thatservices provided by armored car companies are not functionally similarto those offered by banks. Protestant also argues that the proposed activitywould not be a proper incident to banking, it would not result in any significantpublic benefits, and would result in undue concentration of resources,decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound bankingpractices. Finally, Protestant argues that the proposal violates statebranch banking laws and raises the issue of whether Metrocorp's bank subsidiarywould violate the restrictions on payment of interest on demand depositsset forth in the Board's Regulation Q. Protestant has requested a hearingto establish a more complete record on which to base a determination concerningthe issues raised.In view of the issues raised by the application, the Board has concludedthat a hearing would be appropriate in this case. Accordingly, <T3>it is hereby ordered </T3>That a formal and public administrative hearingbe held with respect to the application by Metrocorp to engage in armoredcar activities. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with SubpartA of the Board's Rules of Practice for Hearings (12 CFR Part 263) and willcommence before a hearing officer at the offices of the Board, Washington,DC, or such other place as the hearing officer shall deem appropriate.The Board believes it appropriate that the hearing be concluded as expeditiouslyas possible and, accordingly, orders that the hearing shall be held nolater than 45 days from the date of this Order, at a date set by the hearingofficer, and that the recommended decision be filed with the Board within60 days of the conclusion of the hearing, in accordance with the Board'sRules of Practice for Hearings. <T3>It is further ordered </T3>That the issues to be considered at thishearing are whether the proposed armored car services are so closely relatedto banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incidentthereto, and whether the proposal can reasonably be expected to producebenefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competitionor gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects such asundue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflictsof interests, or unsound banking practices. Further, the Board requestsevidence on the risks of conducting the activity, including the availabilityof adequate insurance against risk of loss.
