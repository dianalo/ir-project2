(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four top Atlantic City officials are among11 people under indictment in a broad corruption probe in thegambling resort, but the grand jury was silent on the mayor, whohad been arrested in the case.   ``It's an active, ongoing investigation,'' the state attorneygeneral's spokesman, Christopher Florentz, said Tuesday. ``It doesnot conclude with today's indictments. The charges at this timehave not been dropped.''   Atlantic City Mayor James Usry had no comment, said RosalindNorrell-Nance, an aide.   ``City government can continue to march,'' said businessadministrator Carl Briscoe, who runs the resort's everyday affairs.   Among those indicted Tuesday were City Council President WalterCollette, Councilman Gene Dorn and Zoning Board Chairman KaleemShabazz, who are all accused of accepting bribes to use theirpositions to obtain zoning breaks and other benefits for privatebusinesses.   Another councilman, Arnold Orsatti Jr., was charged withparticipating in the conspiracy.   A state police sting hit the top echelon of Atlantic City'sgovernment with arrests and corruption charges on July 27. Besidesthe 11 indicted, Usry and two others were arrested in the sweepthat culminated an eight-month investigation.   Usry, 67, was led away from his home by police in a roundup ofsuspects. Authorities said $6,000 in cash was found in his home,but the mayor's attorney said the money was a contribution from abusinessman that Usry was to relay to a children's charity.   The arrest was an embarrassment to state Republicans, includingGov. Thomas H. Kean, who had helped put Usry in office and make himone of the most prominent black Republican officials in the nation.   Including Usry _ who was elected as a reformer _ four ofAtlantic City's last seven mayors have been arrested.   The indictment also named W. Oscar Harris, former director ofthe city's housing authority; Robert McCurdy, a former jockey andpartner in a liquor store; Harold Mosee, an aide to Collette and aformer councilman; and Jack Wolf, a consultant for Pan Am WorldServices.   State Police Superintendent Col. Clinton Pagano said Collette ischarged with accepting a $1,000 bribe in May by Albert Black, whowas cooperating as an undercover agent for the state police.   Authorities said the investigation began when Black approachedthem with reports that Harris had solicited a bribe from him.   Black became a key source for investigators, but his account ofthe complex of alleged bribes and influence was questioned by onesuspect Tuesday.   ``Al Black has altered the facts and corrupted the truth beyondrecognition,'' Wolf said. ``The Salem witch hunts prove that in theend, truth will win out.''   Authorities suspect Collette accepted the bribe in exchange forinfluencing a zoning variance that would enable Black to operate acar wash.   Dorn was accused in the indictment of taking a $7,500 cash bribefrom Black to obtain a zoning variance for a gas station.   Dorn and Wolf were also charged with soliciting and accepting$3,500 in bribes from Black for influencing Pam Am to give Black agift shop concession at Atlantic City International Airport.   All 11 defendants will be arraigned in January in Superior Courtin Trenton.</TEXT></DOC>
