If such legislation becomes law, it would eliminate theonly significant form of private deposit insurance remainingin the country. Nine companies provide deposit insurance forstate-chartered credit unions in 21 states. They insure atotal of around $20 billion in deposits at about 1,400 creditunions.</LP><TEXT>   Many state legislatures moved to eliminate privateinsurance for savings banks in 1985 after several insurersfailed, forcing scores of Maryland and Ohio savings banks tobe shuttered. Now, worried about the possibility of a crisissimilar to Rhode Island developing in their own states,politicians want to eliminate sole dependence on privateinsurance. But the efforts could face opposition from theprivate insurers.   On the federal level, Rep. Henry Gonzalez, chairman of theHouse Banking Committee, wrote a letter to congressionalcolleagues Monday saying he had instructed his staff to drawup legislation that would require all state-charteredinstitutions that collect deposits to be federally insured,and asked for support for the bill.   State legislators are considering similar efforts. &quot;We'llsee a flurry of bills in the states that will put thesethings out of business,&quot; according to Bert Ely, a bankingconsultant based in Arlington, Va.   Indeed, the issue may come up soon in the MassachusettsLegislature, according to a staff member of the jointcommittee on banking. &quot;Given what's happened in Rhode Islandand the fact that the financial services industry is shaky,there will be a move here toward requiring federal insurancefor credit unions,&quot; the staff member said.   The failure in Rhode Island has been blamed in part on laxsupervision of insurers and credit unions by state regulatoryagencies. State-chartered credit unions that are privatelyinsured are exempt from any federal regulation.   &quot;The absence of scrutiny creates an incentive for peopleto make mistakes,&quot; according to consultant Dan Brumbaugh, whosays private insurers have been allowed to operate withoutattention until a crisis erupts. Mr. Brumbaugh recentlycoauthored a study for the House subcommittee on financialinstitutions on deposit insurance.   In the overwhelming majority of states that allow privateinsurance, these companies are regulated by the same stateagency that oversees credit unions, often the state bankingregulators.   Representatives of the insurers argue that insurers areadequately supervised through yearly examinations. &quot;The RhodeIsland situation was an aberration,&quot; according to ChipFilson, president of the National Association of ShareInsurers, the trade association for private insurancecompanies.   Officials found, however, that the Rhode Island Share andDeposit Indemnity Corp. had not been examined for three yearswhen it failed.   The problem, according to some who have looked at the ideaof private insurance, is that the private funds are too smallto absorb problems that develop among the institutions theyinsure. Indeed, the Rhode Island insurer was well-capitalizedcompared with many of its peers. &quot;You have one big hit andthese things can be wiped out,&quot; according to Paula Gold,former Massachusetts secretary for consumer affairs andbusiness regulation who was involved in the elimination ofprivate insurance for savings banks in the state in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
