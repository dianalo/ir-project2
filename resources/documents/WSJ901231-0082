They predict that while the Persian Gulf crisis willcontinue to provide limited support for the dollar in theearly months of 1991, there is still a high risk that theU.S. currency will fall back to its 1990 lows before themiddle of the year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;In the first quarter, the dollar will remain vulnerableto {further} U.S. economic decline and further Fed easing,&quot;predicted David Morrison, chief international economist atGoldman Sachs International in London.   Indeed, on Friday the dollar dropped in very light tradingin reaction to further indications the U.S. economy isweakening rapidly. In late New York trading, the greenbackwas quoted at 1.4936 marks and 134.85 yen, down from 1.5255marks and 136.40 yen late Thursday in New York.   In early Monday trading in Tokyo, the dollar was at 134.32yen, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 136.05 yen. Meanwhile,the dollar was trading at 1.4925 marks, down from 1.5210marks Friday.   Michel Girardin, head of foreign exchange research atUnion Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, warned that a conflictin the Middle East will trigger a short-term dollar rally.But he said this &quot;support will soon disappear as the marketstarts to concentrate again on U.S. economic fundamentals.&quot;   Economists also see little chance that the Group of Sevenleading industrialized countries will run to the dollar'said, because member nations seem to be at odds on the issue.   How long and how strongly the Gulf crisis will work in thedollar's favor remains to be seen. Most economists thinkuncertainty about the chances for an armed conflict is themain factor preventing the U.S. currency from falling at themoment. They suggest that this could make the currencyvulnerable to a downturn if a war starts and sentimentswiftly refocuses on the U.S. economic slowdown and thepossibility of further reductions in U.S. interest rates.   Nigel Rendell, international economist at James Capel andamp;Co., says he expects the U.S. federal funds rate to declineone-half of a percentage point to about 6 1/2% in the firstquarter of 1991. About the same time, Germany will probablyraise interest rates another notch and further underminesupport for the dollar, he predicted. The federal funds rateis the interest rate banks charge each other for overnightloans.   Mr. Rendell predicted the dollar could drop to 1.45 marksin the second quarter. UBS's Mr. Girardin thinks it couldeven fall below 1.40 marks. The dollar's all-time low was1.4625 marks, set Dec. 10.   &quot;I would be surprised to see any rebound in the dollaruntil there are signs of the {U.S.} recession passing,&quot; Mr.Girardin said. Most economists don't expect any such signs ofrecovery to appear until midyear. By then, they also expectsigns of a slowdown in Japan and Germany.   How far the dollar recovers will depend largely on howquickly U.S. authorities increase interest rates. Someeconomists suggest that the need to attract funds for theTreasury's massive refunding programs will create pressure tonudge rates higher as soon as possible.   But Robert Thomas, senior international economist atMidland Montagu andamp; Co. in London, said officials will have toshow caution because the economic recovery is likely to begradual and the fragile state of the U.S. financial systemwill argue against any abrupt credit-tightening.   By contrast, German rates are widely expected to riseanother half to full percentage point in the first half of1991 as the Bundesbank attempts to curb inflationaryexpectations kindled by last October's reunification of Eastand West Germany.   German inflation is likely to have peaked by the middle of1991, though, and with the mark's strength depressing exportvolumes and economic growth starting to slow, authoritiesshould be more receptive to lower interest rates and a weakermark, economists say.   Japanese interest rates are also expected to rise early in1991 because the Bank of Japan remains concerned about highwage demands and persistently high money-supply growth.   However, economists doubt that Japan will tighten policysignificantly, given signs that growth could slow sharplynext year. At the same time, Mr. Girardin of UBS added, theyen isn't likely to benefit much from higher rates, whichwould merely increase fears of a possible collapse in landprices that would prompt another shakeout in Japan's stockmarket.   Such concerns, says Mr. Thomas of Midland, could force adecline in Japanese rates well before German rates head downin 1991. And, after falling as low as 120 yen in the firsthalf of 1991, the dollar could recover to its current levelof around 135 yen by the end of 1991, he predicted.   This year, the dollar fell to a low of about 123.50 yen inmid-October before rebounding as high as 137.05 yen near theend of the year.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold forcurrent delivery settled at $394 an ounce, up $8.60.Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.   In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at$391 an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
