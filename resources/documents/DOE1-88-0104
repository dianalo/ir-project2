<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-88-0104 </DOCNO><TEXT>This is a report in the framework of the research project 'AppropriateEnergy Use' on the sun's radiation energy and on the meteorological conditionsgiven in Kaernten. Objects of the report are the solar constant, globalradiation including direct and diffuse radiation, the daily and annualcurve of solar radiation, radiation received by inclined surfaces (diagram),and the total figures for the global radiation received (maps). A furthersubject is the earth's energy balance. Explanations provided in thisconnection relate to the global radiation energy, energy conversion,further energy sources of the earth, and radiation energy as a preconditionfor life and raw materials (biological cycle, graph). The third partof the report is concerned with the possibilities existing in theoryfor converting solar energy into useful energy (the vision behind thisbeing hydrogen generation through solar-cell 'plantations' in the Saharaby electrolysis and transportation of hydrogen via pipelines to Europe).(HWJ)</TEXT></DOC>
