 In a number of countries,ISDN is still a technology-led development.andP;  As yet, however, there isn't auniversal demand for ISDN services.andP;  Therefore, the pressure to implementISDN often comes from network operators, not users.andM;The way ISDN is being implemented in various parts of the world differs,invariably reflecting the regulatory environment of each country.andP;  Basically,there are three different approaches to the implementation of ISDN,categorized by developments in North America, Europe and Japan.andM;ISDN in North AmericaandM;Unlike that in Europe, the telecommunications environment in North America ishighly deregulated.andP;  There are many network operators, specialized carriers,long-distance carriers and value-added network operators from whom the usercan choose telecommunications services.andP;  In such a situation, the developmentof a common standard network such as ISDN is bound to be more complex than ina state-controlled post, telegraph and telecommunications (PTT) monopoly.andM;Each of the major carriers and network operators (Bell Operating Companies)has announced plans to introduce ISDN-compatible networks in various stagesand at different times.andP;  Unfortunately, there is no universal consistency inthe level and types of services they will offer during any transitionalstage.andP;  This is certain to lead to complications, especially in the area ofinterworking between various different networks.andP;  This aspect may beadditionally complicated by the fact that ISDN interworking is one of themajor areas still under study by the CCITT.andM;In general, most early U.S.andP;  ISDN services, as in Europe, will be geared tomedium-sized to large corporate users.andP;  In many cases, this will involve theprovision of ISDN Centrex services through a limited set of standardinterfaces.andP;  In addition, private branch exchange (PBX) manufacturers aredeveloping ISDN-compatible systems that can provide integrated voice and datainterfaces in line with the ISDN 2B+D Basic Rate Access.andP;  The PBX would thenprovide the Primary Rate 23B+D interface to the network operator's localdigital exchange.andM;Before the whole network has been upgraded to ISDN, it will be necessary fornetwork operators to offer interim ISDN access arrangements, including thedevelopment of ISDN ''islands'' and the installation of an ISDN overlaynetwork.andP;  In an island strategy, certain key network centers (normallycorresponding to high-traffic urban areas) are converted to ISDN byinstalling ISDN-compatible switching, signalling and transmission equipmentcovering a specific geographic area.andP;  This allows the operator to offerlimited ISDN facilities during the early stages of development, expandingthese services as more islands are installed and ISDN interworking betweenislands is established.andM;The overlay approach, on the other hand, involves setting up an entirelyseparate ISDN network in addition to existing facilities and overlaying itonto the existing network.andP;  One of the advantages of an overlay network isthat it can be installed fairly quickly and can be extended to cover a largegeographical area.andM;ISDN in EuropeandM;In Europe, each of the various PTTs is implementing its own plans for ISDN.andO;With the exception of the United Kingdom, all the PTTs in Europe are more orless government-controlled and do not have to compete in the provision oftelecommunications services.andM;Throughout Europe, PTTs and network operators are undertaking major networkexpansion programs converting existing analog switching and transmissionequipment to digital.andP;  All major European countries are installing ISDNeither as pilot or commercial network services.andP;  The European Community isactively involved in promoting ISDN (and telecommunications services ingeneral) in each of the member countries.andP;  This is being done primarilythrough the creation of a single Europe-wide market for telecommunicationsequipment and an action program for the installation of ISDN.andM;The aim of creating a single European market for telecommunications equipmentis to establish a common set of equipment standards, thus allowing devicesmanufactured in one European country to be connected to a network in another.andO;The aim of this program is not to create new standards but to harmonize theimplementation of existing ones.andM;The most advanced ISDN broadband network of its kind in Europe has beendeveloped by the West German Bundespost (a PTT).andP;  The Bundespost isdeveloping ISDN services for both existing and future broadband networks.andO;Since the mid-1980s, the Bundespost has been operating a pilot, 140M-bpsfiber-optic-based broadband network.andP;  This network provides a number ofbusiness and domestic services such as CATV distribution.andP;  A full, commercialISDN that covers all the main business and population centers is not expectedto be in operation until the early 1990s.andM;In Japan, ISDN is evolving quite differently.andP;  Although competition isgradually being introduced into the provision of both domestic andinternational telecommunications services, the Japanese approach to ISDN ispart of a wide, government-sponsored national technology project.andP;  Thisproject is called the Information Network System (INS), and it encompasses awide range of technologies and applications -- from fiber optics to video andfifth-generation computers.andM;Among current ISDN plans and implementations, Japan's INS project is one ofthe most ambitious and far-reaching.andP;  The fundamental difference between INSand other ISDNs lies not in the technology but in the nature of the projectitself.andP;  INS forms a major part of a government-sponsored initiative to takeJapan into the ''Information Age'' as quickly and as coherently as possible.andM;Also included in the INS project are the current research activities onfifth-generation computer systems.andP;  When completed, these activities willprovide a number of additional computing features within INS.andM;INS and StandardsandM;The basic channel structure of INS, unlike that of the CCITT, was made up ofone 64K-bps channel, one 16K-bps channel for voice or data and one 8K-bpssignalling channel (64+16+8).andM;As INS becomes more generally available, this non-ISDN-standard channelstructure is being replaced with the conventional 64+64+16 CCITT channelstructure.andP;  In addition, INS integrates optical-fiber-based broadbandcommunications into the network for a variety of video applications.andM;During the early 1990s, ISDN services will be available in one form oranother in every major city and business center in the United States.andO;Although most U.S.andP;  ISDN trials began somewhat later than those in Europe,all of the major Bell Operating Companies are actively involved inimplementing ISDN services.andM;How ISDN develops in the United States will depend to a large extent onmarket demand.andP;  In a country that has a monopoly-controlledtelecommunications network, new facilities such as ISDN tend to be led fromthe supply side.andP;  In a competitive network environment, the introduction ofnew facilities is much more demand-led.andM;Next week, in the final article of this series, we'll look at the informationand entertainment services that will be supplied by ISDN for the home.andM;----------The James Martin Productivity Series, an information service updatedquarterly, is available through High Productivity Software Inc., ofMarblehead, Mass.andP;
