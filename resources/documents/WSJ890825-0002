ATandamp;T also said Capital Cities/ABC Inc. agreed to buy a total of nine transponders on the two new satellites, which will be launched in 1993 and 1994. ATandamp;T said television networks normally lease transponder space for transmission. An ABC spokesman wouldn't disclose the value of the contract or say why ABC chose to buy, rather than lease.    All three companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and in composite trading yesterday ATandamp;T common closed at $40.125, up $1.50, on volume of 2.7 million shares; GE closed at $58.125, up $1.125, as 1.9 million shares changed hands and Capital Cities stock closed at $507.50, up $4, on volume of 43,800 shares.    Unlike existing satellites, ATandamp;T said each of the two Telstar 4 satellites will have transponders operating at C-band and Ku-band radio frequencies. Customers will be able to transmit in one frequency and receive in another. That ability is particularly useful for television networks.    The new satellites also will increase ATandamp;T's ability to get into the market for business transmission. Businesses are increasingly putting together satellite networks to send data on Ku-band, which, because of its higher frequency, allows the use of small, inexpensive earth stations.    ATandamp;T said each satellite will have 24 C-band transponders and 20 Ku-band transponders. The satellites also will be able to vary power on the transponders, giving them the ability to provide services that haven't been successful in the past, such as direct broadcast television. Besides competition from cable television, direct broadcast television hasn't sold because existing satellites aren't powerful enough to be paired with cheap earth stations. The telephone giant said it eventually will build a third satellite in the Telstar 4 series. Each satellite will be designed to last 12 years. ATandamp;T hasn't yet selected a launch vehicle. </TEXT></DOC>
