In another part of town, the Zulu parade lined up _ blacks inblack face and grass skirts in an age-old spoof of the city'spretentious social circles.   Eleven parades were scheduled in the New Orleans area, and up to1.8 million people were expected for the celebration of excess thatends Carnival's month of balls and two weeks of parades before thestart of Lent.   At dawn, most of the activity was along St. Charles Avenue, themain parade route, where early risers staked out their positions andset up tents, makeshift bars and barbecue grills for a day-longfrolic.   ``You have to get here early to get a curbside spot. Last year Ididn't get here until 6 and I was five rows back,'' said Ross Allen,whose place had been staked out at midnight.   The festivities have been marred by the slaying of a touristknown as ``Mr. Mardi Gras'' to his friends.   Mardi Gras ends midnight, when Ash Wednesday ushers in six weeksof Lenten repentance to this predominantly Roman Catholic city.   ``Last year we had about a million people on the streets duringthe day,'' said Ray Holman, chief of police field operations.   ``I think that if the weather doesn't get totally unbearablewe'll get at least that number again, maybe more.''   He said crowds were bigger than usual despite wet, cold weatherduring the popular weekend Endymion and Bacchus parades. Badweather, however, canceled Fat Tuesday parades in the little Acadiancommunities of Grand Marais and Loreauville.   The National Weather Service forecast a 50 percent chance of rainor drizzle, with highs in the upper 40s but winds near 15 mph makingit feel as if it were near 30.   For Stacy Winck, 19, of New Orleans, ear muffs and a down parkadid little to fend off the wind that made temperatures in the 30sfeel much colder.   ``We're acting like idiots,'' she said. ``But it's all in thefun.''   That kind of weather can be good for business, bartenders said.   ``People want to come in out of the cold,'' said Bill Hadley,manager of Lulu White's Mahogany Hall bar.   But Ivan Cook of Phoenix said only a downpour could keep himunder a roof on Mardi Gras.   ``When you're out on the street you don't feel it,'' said Cook,who was among the thousands of tourists jamming the city.   Hotels decked in the carnival colors of purple, green and goldwere nearly at capacity.   There were two parades Monday, and a Mississippi riverfrontshopping development held its third annual ``Lundi Gras''celebration with bands, fireworks, a riverboat parade and theceremonial arrival by boat of a man dressed as Rex, King of Carnival.   The identity of the real Rex _ a different member of New Orleanssociety each year _ is kept secret until the final hours before herides in the biggest parade of the season and meets the mayor for achampagne toast before downtown crowds.   This year the honor went to Beauregard Bassich, 62, executivedirector of City Park.   The slaying occurred early Monday.   Randy Michael Robichaux, 37, of Baton Rouge, was fatally shotafter turning out his pockets to show a holdup man he didn't haveany money, a companion told police. No arrests have been made.   Authorities said Robichaux was an employee at Louisiana StateUniversity who came to New Orleans to see Sunday night's Bacchusparade.   ``As far as I'm concerned, he was LSU's Mr. Mardi Gras. I justtold someone the other day purple, green and yellow run through hisblood,'' said Renee J. Nesbitt, director of residential housing atLSU, where Robichaux supervised four dormitories.   She said he had designed the floats for the campus Krewe of theTiger carnival parade for seven years, and rode in the group'seighth annual parade Thursday.   The slaying was not the only problems connected with Carnival.   Two float riders were injured when they were hit by objectsthrown at them, police spokeswoman Yvonne Bechet said. Both werereleased after treatment at New Orleans hospitals.   A man was injured when he fell about 12 feet from a float.</TEXT></DOC>
