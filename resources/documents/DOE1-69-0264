<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-0264 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have investigated the structure and composition of La{sub 2}CuO{sub4} (both pure and Sr-doped) and Nd(Ba{sub 2{minus}x} using powder neutrondiffraction. In La{sub 2{minus}x}Sr{sub x}CuO{sub 4}, T{sub c} reachesits maximum at x {equals} 0.15, after which vacancies are introducedin the 2D planes and superconductivity is destroyed. Superconductivityin La{sub 2}CuO{sub 4} is not bulk. No evidence for nonstoichiometryin this material can be observed. In the Nd(Ba{sub 2{minus}x}Nd{sub x})Cu{sub3}O{sub 7} system, T{sub c} is a complex function of oxygen orderingand electronic effects. 16 refs., 12 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
