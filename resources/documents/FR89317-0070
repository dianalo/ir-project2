The petitioner requested inaccordance with andSection; 353.53a(a) of the Commerce Regulations that weconduct an administrative review. We published a notice of initiation ofthe antidumping duty administrative review on March 2, 1988 (53 FR 6681).The Department has now conducted that administrative review in accordancewith section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(``HTS''), as provided for in section 1201 <T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s).Imports covered by this review are shipments of brass sheet and strip.During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under item612.3900 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated. This merchandiseis currently classifiable under HTS items 7409.21.00 and 7409.29.00. TheHTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. Thewritten description remains dispositive.The review covers one manufacturer/exporter, Poongsan Metal Corporation,of brass sheet and strip from the Republic of Korea and the period August22, 1986 through December 31, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>In calculating United States price the Department used purchase price asdefined in section 772 of the Tariff Act. Purchase price was based on thepacked, f.o.b., c. and f., or c.i.f. price to unrelated purchasers in theUnited States, as appropriate. We made adjustments, where applicable, forU.S. and foreign brokerage, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. and foreigninland freight, processing fees, harbor fees, warehousing fees, and dutydrawback. We disallowed a claimed adjustment for document handling chargespaid to United States banks and postage expenses paid to Korean banks asdirect expenses. However, we included these expenses in the calculationfor credit. No other adjustments were claimed or allowed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>In calculating foreign market value the Department used home market pricesas defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act since sufficient quantitiesof such or similar merchandise were sold at or above the cost of productionto provide a basis for comparison. The petitioners alleged sales belowcost in the home market during the period. Our cost analysis covered onlyalloy 70/30 because there were no other alloys sold in the home marketduring the period that were contemperaneous with the sales to the UnitedStates. Based on our analysis, we found all sales of alloy 70/30 to beat or above cost. We did not use the price to the related purchaser in the home market becauseour comparison of the related and the unrelated sales of alloy 70/30 withidentical product codes, sold in the same month, showed that a vast majorityof the related sales received a more favorable price. As a result, homemarket price was based on the packed ex-factory or f.o.b. warehouse priceto unrelated purchasers. We made adjustments, where appropriate, for inlandfreight and differences in packing, warranty, credit expenses, and physicalcharacteristics of the merchandise. We disallowed a claimed adjustmentfor advertising expenses because the advertising was not directed to thecustomer's customer, and did not promote any particular brass. Such generalizedinstitutional advertising is an indirect rather than a direct selling expense.We did not adjust home market price for the document handling charges paidto a related party because there are indirect selling expenses. No otheradjustments were claimed or allowed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of the Review </ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminary determine that a margin of 25.58percent exists for Poongsan Metal Corporation for the period August 22,1986 through December 31, 1987.
