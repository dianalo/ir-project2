Introduction. </ITAG>Whether to grant or deny an employer's petition to import a nonimmigrantalien to the United States for the purpose of temporary employment is solelythe decision of the Attorney General and his designee, the Commissionerof the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The Immigration andNationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101<T3> et seq.</T3>), as amended by the Immigration Reform and Control Actof 1986 (IRCA), Pub. L. 99-603, 100 Stat. 3359, provides that the AttorneyGeneral may not approve such a petition from an employer for employmentof nonimmigrant alien workers (H-2A visaholders or workers) for temporaryor seasonal services or labor in agriculture unless the petitioner hasapplied to the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) for a labor certificationshowing that: (1) There are not sufficient U.S. workers who are able, willing,and qualified and who will be available at the time and place needed toperform the labor or services involved in the petition; and (2) the employmentof the alien in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wagesand working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed.The amendments to the INA made by IRCA codified DOL's role in the temporaryalien agricultural labor certification process. Prior to June 1, 1987,many of DOL's responsibilities specified in IRCA were carried out underthe requirement in the INA at 8 U.S.C. 1184(c) that the Attorney Generalconsult with appropriate agencies of the Government concerning the importationof nonimmigrant workers, and under INS regulations governing the relianceplaced by INS on the advice of DOL relative to U.S. worker availabilityand adverse effect. See 8 CFR 214.2(h)(3)(i) (1986); 20 CFR Part 655, SubpartC (1986). The H-2A-related amendments to the INA made by IRCA apply to petitionsand applications filed under INA sections 214(c) and 216 on or after theeffective date of June 1, 1987. IRCA section 301(d), 8 U.S.C. 1186 note;see U.S.C. 1184(c) and 1186. Section 301(e) of IRCA requires that ``[n]otwithstandingany other provision of law, final regulations to implement * * * [sections101(a)(15)(ii)(a) and 216 of the Immigration and Nationality Act] shallfirst be issued, on an interim or other basis, not later than the effectivedate.'' 8 U.S.C. 1186 note. On May 5, 1987, DOL published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 16770) a proposed rule to implement DOL'sresponsibilities under the H-2A temporary alien agricultural labor certificationprogram, as set out at sections 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a), 214(c), and 216 ofthe INA, as amended by IRCA. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(ii)(a), 1184(c), and1186). Under that program, job opportunities are certified for H-2A workersto perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal naturein the United States. Written comments on the proposed rule were invitedthrough May 19, 1987. On June 1, 1987, DOL published an interim final rule in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>effective on that date. 52 FR 20496. The rulemakingdocument discussed many of the comments received in response to the proposedrule, changing some language not relevant to this document. The commentperiod also was reopened through July 31, 1987. The amendments in DOL'sJune 1, 1987, interm final rule contained changes to the labor certificationprocess as mandated by IRCA and revised procedures as deemed necessaryby DOL to carry out its statutory responsibilities. In December 1987, theUnited States of Appeals for the DC Circuit remanded the interim finalrule to DOL for a further explanation of the June 1, 1987, methodology.In April 1988, an explanation of the June 1, 1987, rule was submitted tothe U.S. District Court. That court recently rules that the new explanationwas unaccepted because it was based, in part, on information not in therule-making record on June 1. While the DOL disagrees with the ruling andcontinues to litigate that issue, DOL herein proposes to adopt the samemethodology adopted on June 1, 1987, but utilizing an expanded rulemakingrecord. This procedure was suggested by the court and agreed to by theplaintiffs at the September 28, 1988, oral argument. Comments on the interimfinal rule and the proposed rule continue to be considered. Based on thosecomments, as well as on comments submitted in response to this rulemaking,a final rule will be promulgated at a later date after consideration ofall comments. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. The June 1, 1987, Methodology</ITAG>IRCA is expected to expand significantly the lawful importation program.DOL, therefore, decided to establish H-24 program adverse effect wage rates(AEWRs) not merely for the 14 ``traditional user States'', but insteadto set them for every State (except Alaska). In order to ensure that thewages of similarly employed U.S. workers are not adversely affected, DOLcontinued in the June 1, 1987, interim final H-2A regulation its past policyand practice of requiring covered agricultural employers to offer and paytheir U.S. and H-2A workers no less than the applicable AEWR, as determinedby the Director, U.S. Employment Service (USES). Further, the interim finalH-2A regulations, as had the H-2A regulations, provided that employersapplying for temporary alien agricultural labor certifications must agreeto comply with all employment-related laws. If the employment is coveredby a wage standard applicable under any federal or State minimum wage law,the employer must comply with that law. See <T3>e.g.,</T3> 29 U.S.C. 206(a); and 20 CFR 653.501(d)(4) and (e)(1) (1986).If the prevailing wage for the occupation in the labor market of intendedemployment is higher, the employer must offer and pay that wage. Thus,a worker in employment under the H-2A program must be paid at the highestof the applicable wage rates, whether that highest rate is the AEWR, theprevailing wage, or the federal or State statutory minimum wage. See <T3>Limoneira Co. </T3>v. <T3>Wirtz, </T3>327 F.2d 499 (9th Cir. 1964), <T3>aff'g, </T3>225 F.Supp. 961 (S.D. Cal. 1963); see also <T3>Elton Orchards, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Brennan, </T3>508 F.2d 1154, 1156 (1st Cir. 1974); and <T3>Flecha </T3>v. <T3>Quiros, </T3>567 F.2d 1154, 1156 (1st Cir. 1977). These decisions acknowledgeDOL's discretion in the area of AEWRs and form a basis for construing DOL'sH-2A regulations. Although continuing its basic past policy of requiring the payment of theAEWR, prevailing wage, or statutory minimum wage, whichever is highest,DOL, in the June 1, 1987, interim final rule, revised the procedures forcalculating and establishing AEWRs for H-2A work. DOL changed the methodof calculating AEWRS, by basing AEWRs on the level of actual average hourlyagricultural wages for each State, as surveyed by the U.S. Department ofAgriculture (USDA). This new methodology sets AEWRs in each year for theH-2A program at a level equal to the previous year's annual regional averagehourly wage rates for field and livestock workers (combined), as computedby USDA quarterly wage surveys. (This is the same data series by whichAEWRs under the previous H-2 agricultural worker program were indexed.USDA publishes the data for the 48 contiguous States and Hawaii by nineteenagricultural regions, which consist of one or more States.) The new methodology ties AEWRs directly to the average wage, as opposedto the old methodology which resulted in AEWRs substantially higher thanagricultural earnings in many States, and lower for some States. The newmethodology is based directly on a current average agricultural wage thatis not apparently depressed by the presence of foreign workers, ratherthan being based on a 1950 agricultural wage that had been adjusted upwardby various methods over the years, as discussed below in Section IV.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. AFL-CIO v. Brock</ITAG>Upon publication of the interim final rule, the AFL-CIO sued DOL to, amongother things, invalidate the interim final 20 CFR 655.107(a), which establishedthe methodology for computing AEWRs.On December 22, 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia Circuit reversed a lower court decision that had invalidatedthe interim final 20 CFR 655.107(a). <T3>American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations</T3>v. <T3>Brock, </T3>835 F.2d 912 (DC Cir. 1987), <T3>rev'g, </T3>668 F. Supp. 31 (D.D.C. 1987). Also vacated was that portionof the lower court decision that stayed the implementation of the June1, 1987, interim final AEWR methodology in 20 CFR 655.107(a). 835 F.2dat 913 n. 2. However, the DC Circuit held that the interim final rule didnot contain information sufficient for the court to ``discern the reasonablenessof the action without further explanation'' and remanded the matter ``tothe Department for a more adequate explanation of its actions * * *'' 835F.2d at 913 n. 2, 919, and 920. The DC Circuit, therefore, remanded therulemaking for DOL to provide a more reasoned explanation for why it chosein the June 1, 1987, methodology to discontinue what it viewed as the priorpractice of providing for an enhancement to correct for the past employmentof legal and undocumented aliens. Upon remand, the District Court orderedthe ``reasoned explanation'' to be issued on or before April 30, 1988,unless otherwise ordered. <T3>AFL-CIO </T3>v. <T3>Brock, </T3>Civil Action No. 87-1683 (Order, D.D.C. March 25, 1988).DOL submitted the expanded explanation to the District Court in April 1988.DOL engaged in an extensive analysis of the opinion, a review of the pre-and post-June 1, 1987, rulemaking record and other data, and consultationswith other affected agencies of the Federal Government. As a result ofthose consultations, and on the basis of its own analysis, DOL herein proposesto adopt prospectively the AEWR methodolgy set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Historical Protections Against Adverse Effect on Wages</ITAG>A. History of AEWRs<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background</ITAG>In order to adequately assess the court's concern that the June 1, 1987,AEWR methodology represents a substantial departure from past practice,it is necessary to review DOL's longstanding practice in setting AEWRs.From the beginning of the Federal Government's involvement in the lawfulimportation of foreign agricultural workers, dating at least as far backas 1942, the Government has sought to protect similarly employed U.S. workersfrom the adverse effect such employment would have on their wages. At first,these programs were established under both international agreements andfederal statutes, and more recently by federal statutes alone.For a number of decades, DOL has computed and published AEWRs for the temporaryemployment of nonimmigrant alien workers for agricultural employment undervarious admission programs. <T3>See </T3>H.N. DELLON, ``Foreign Agricultural Workers and the Preventionof Adverse Effect'', 17 <T3>Labor Law Journal </T3>739 (1966). Mr. Dellon's article notes that,as far back as 1953, employers seeking to import foreign nationals to workin various crop activities (in that case, under the Bracero Program) wererequired to pay not less than a wage established by DOL. Eventually, AEWRsbegan to be set periodically on a Statewide basis. See <T3>Dona Ana County Farm andamp; Livestock Bureau, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Goldberg, </T3>200 F. Supp. 210 (D.D.C. 1961).As time passed, establishment of AEWRs became more formalized, and AEWRswere computed and set for the H-2 agricultural worker program as well,after public notice and comment. See, <T3>e.g., </T3>29 FR 19101, 19102 (December 30, 1964); 32 FR 4569, 4571(March 28, 1967); and 35 FR 12394, 12395 (August 4, 1970).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. World War II Programs</ITAG>The 1942 Agreement With Mexico Respecting the Temporary Migration of MexicanWorkers, stemming from the wartime shortage of domestic farm labor, facilitatedthe importation of Mexican workers in the beginnings of the ``Bracero program''.56 Stat. 1759, EAS 278 (July 23 and August 4, 1942). The 1942 Agreementrequired that the Mexican workers be paid the same wage rates as thosepaid to U.S. farmworkers, but in no event could hourly rate workers bepaid less than $.30 per hour. See Wayne D. Rasmussen, <T3>A History of the Emergency Farm Labor Supply Program, 1943-47, </T3>U.S.Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Agricultural Economics, MonographNo. 13 (September 1951) (Rasmussen) at 203. The $.30 per hour wage wasequivalent to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) minimum wagethen applicable to nonagricultural employment. In 1943, the $.30 per hourminimum in the 1942 Agreement was extended to piece-rate workers. 57 Stat.1152, EAS 351 (April 26, 1943). In 1946, the wage was raised to $.37 perhour or $33.60 per week (the latter for bi-weekly-paid workers). See Rasmussenat 211.Congress specifically authorized the Bracero program, and programs to importfarmworkers from other Western Hemisphere areas, by statute by enactingPub. L. 45 in 1943. Act of April 29, 1943, c. 82, 57 Stat. 70. Pub. L.45 and the agreements with the foreign governments provided the basic structurefor the operation of the Mexican and other foreign farm labor programsthrough 1947.Other international agreements, although less formal, were entered intowith the Bahamas, Barbados, Jamaica, Canada, and Newfoundland (then separatefrom Canada):(a) By a March 16, 1943, agreement establishing the Bahamian program, workerswere guaranteed the higher of the local prevailing wage or $.30 per hour(equivalent to the FLSA minimum wage). See Rasmussen at 225. This was raisedto $15.00 weekly or $30.00 bi-weekly in 1946. See Rasmussen at 240.(b) By an April 2, 1943, agreement establishing the Jamaican program, workerswere guaranteed the higher of the local prevailing wage of $.30 per hour(equivalent to the FLSA minimum wage). See Rasmussen at 250-51. This wasraised to $15.00 weekly or $30.00 bi-weekly in 1946. See Rasmussen at 253.(c) By a May 24, 1944, agreement establishing the Barbadian program, workerswere guaranteed the higher of the local prevailing wage or $.30 per hour(equivalent to the FLSA minimum wage). See Rasmussen at 273-274. This wasraised to $15.00 weekly or $30.00 bi-weekly in 1946. See Rasmussen at 275.(d) Thirteen cents and $.15 per barrel minimum piece rates were set forCanadian farmworkers in the Maine potato harvest. Rasmussen at 276.(e) By a March 23, and 24, 1944, agreement establishing the Newfoundlandprogram, dairy workers were guaranteed the higher of the local prevailingwage or $65.00 per month. See Rasmussen at 282.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Post-war Program</ITAG>The World War II programs ended at the close of 1947. However, temporaryforeign agricultural workers continued to enter the United States, particularlyfrom Mexico, pursuant to section 3 of the Immigration Act of 1917, andpost-war extensions and revisions of the 1942 international agreement.61 Stat. 3738, TIAS 1710 (March 25 and April 2, 1947); 62 Stat. 3887, TIAS1968 (February 21, 1948); and 2 U.S.T. 1048, TIAS 2260 (August 1, 1949).The agreement was information extended in 1950. The work contract underthe post-1947 agreements differed in the area of wages, however. Therewas no guaranteed hourly wage (in 1945 this was $.37 per hour) and no guaranteedminimum piece-rate earnings.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Bracero Program</ITAG>Concern was raised, however, that importation of these workers had causedwages in their areas of employment to lag. President's Commission on MigratoryLabor, <T3>Migratory Labor in American Agriculture</T3> (1951) at 58-59. Afternegotiations with Mexico, a new agreement was negotiated, authorized byPub. L. 78, c. 223, 65 Stat. 119 (July 12, 1951), 7 U.S.C. 1461-1468 (1951)(now deleted). Mexican workers could not be admitted unless the Secretaryof Labor determined, among other things, that ``the employment of the workerswill not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of domesticagricultural workers similarly employed. * * * * '' A new internationalagreement was signed, effective August 11, 1951. Migrant Labor Agreementof 1951, 2 U.S.T. 1940, TIAS 2331, 162 UNTS 103 (August 11, 1951). Workerswere to be paid the prevailing wage rates. As amended and updated in the1950's and early 1960's, the 1951 statute and international agreement authorizedthe Bracero program in that period.The 1961 extension of the 1951 agreement added the requirement that thewages stated in the contract shall be no less than an adverse effect wagerate determined by the Secretary of Labor. 10 U.S.T. 1630, TIAS 4815; 12U.S.T. 3130, TIAS 4913. In 1962, these ranged from $.60 per hour in Arkansasto $1.00 per hour in 17 other States. The ceiling was set to correspond(rounded to the nearest $.05) to the USDA`s national survey of averageagricultural earnings, which was found to be $.99 in 1961. By comparison,the FLSA minimum (not yet extended to agriculture) was $1.15 per hour.States with average earnings above the national average were held to the$1.00 rate; and one State at the national average was rounded down to $.95.In six other States with average earnings below the national average, theAEWR was set generally by taking the State average hourly farm wage rate,as reported in the 1959 Census of Agriculture and adjusting it to 1961in accordance with the trend in farm wage rates for that State as measuredby USDA's series of average hourly farm wage rates with the obtained figuresrounded down to the next $.05. These AEWRs applied only to the Braceroprogram. The 1962 AEWRs for 24 Bracero-user States continued to be usedin 1963 and in 1964, the final year of the Bracero program. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. H-2 Program</ITAG>In 1952, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.1101 <T3>et seq., </T3>which, as amended and updated, controls the importationof other foreign agricultural workers (and, since 1962, Mexican workersas well). This was known as the H-2 program (now replaced under IRCA bythe H-2A Program). The use of legally admitted non-Mexican workers was,until the late 1970's, mainly in Atlantic seaboard States (with the exceptionof sheepherders in the western States). Only prevailing wages were required to be offered under the H-2 programuntil 1963. In that year, near the close of the Bracero program, the H-2program established a series of AEWRs for 11 East Coast H-2 user States.A maximum AEWR ($1.00 per hour) was retained, but the bases for the rateswere derived from the 1959 Census of Agriculture average hourly earningsfor each State adjusted by the 1959-61 trend in wages as determined byUSDA. The 1963 AEWRs continued to be used in 1964.A new formula was applied to set AEWRs for 28 States using foreign agriculturalworkers in 1965. See 20 CFR 602.10 (1965), 29 FR 19101 (December 30, 1964).The formula used the 1950 Census of Agricultural average hourly farm wage(AHFW) rate for each State, adjusted by the 1950-63 trend in gross averagehourly earnings of production workers in manufacturing or the 1950 Censusof Agriculture national AHFW rate similarly adjusted, whichever was higher,rounded down to the nearest $.05. A minimum AEWR of $1.15 per hour anda maximum of $1.40 per hour was applied. The AEWR was set above the computedlevel in five New England States (all except Connecticut), to $1.25 forMaine and to $1.30 for the other four States. The maximum caused AEWRsin five States (California, Kansas, Minnesota, South Dakota, and Utah)to be lowered below the computed level, to $1.40.In 1967, AEWRs were increased by $.20 per hour, based on 1963-66 changesin the USDA survey of farm wages and other factors.Beginning in 1968, these AEWRs were computed by adjusting the previousyear's Statewide AEWR by the same percentage as the percentage change inthe Statewide annual average wage rates for field and livestock workers,as surveyed by the USDA, and were set through rulemaking amending the H-2agricultural worker regulations. See 41 FR 25018 (June 22, 1976); and 43FR 10306, 10310 (March 10, 1978); see also 20 CFR 602.10b(a)(1) (1977).The regulations for the H-2 agricultural worker program were consolidatedand substantially revised in 1978, after an extended comment period andsix public hearings (May and June 1977). 20 CFR Part 655, Subpart C, 43FR 10306 (March 10, 1978). As part of that rulemaking, DOL's methodologyfor computing AEWRs, as well as alternative methodologies for computingAEWRs, were discussed and considered. 43 FR at 10310-10311. The methodologywas set out in the regulations for the H-2 agricultural worker program.20 CFR 655. 207, 43 FR at 10317.DOL continued to study the AEWR after the 1977-78 rulemaking. An AdvanceNotice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in 1979, and six additionalpublic hearings were held. 44 FR 59890 (October 16, 1979). Various alternativemethodologies were presented for public comment; the public responded tothe alternatives and additional methodologies were suggested as part ofthe rulemaking record. A proposed rule (with a four-month comment period)was published in 1980, and a final rule was published in 1981. 46 FR 4568(January 16, 1981); 45 FR 29854 (May 6, 1980); and 45 FR 15914 (March 11,1980). The final rule would have established a single, nationwide, AEWRat the level of the previous year's national annual average hourly wagefor piece-rate-paid hired agricultural workers, as computed by USDA surveys.However, as part of a general review of agency regulations, and to considerfully the impact of the new methodology, it was withdrawn prior to itseffective date. 46 FR 32437 (June 23, 1981); and 46 FR 19119 (March 27,1981).In 1981, USDA substantially reduced its number of surveys and ceased compilingannual average field and livestock worker wage rates, as well as the surveydata which would have been used in the rule withdrawn in 1981. Variousinterim methodologies were utilized until USDA reestablished its surveysand DOL reestablished the 1968-1981 methodology. The interim methodologiesdid not change the basic way in which AEWRs were computed, by adjustingthe previous year's rate by the annual change in farm worker wages as reflectedin a wage survey. These were accompanied by further rulemaking, and opportunityfor and consideration of public comments. See, <T3>e.g., </T3> 51 FR 20516, (June 5, 1986), 51 FR 15915  (April 29, 1986);51 FR 12872  (April 16, 1986); 50 FR 47636  (November 19, 1985); 49 FR31784 (August 8, 1984); 49 FR 30208  (July 27, 1984); 48 FR 40168  (September2, 1983); 48 FR 33684  (July 22, 1983); 48 FR 232  (January 4, 1983); 47FR 52198  (November 19, 1982); and 47 FR 37980  (August 27, 1982). <ITAG tagnum="81"> B. </ITAG><T3>Summary</T3>This review of the history of the setting of AEWRs over the past 40 yearsleads to two conclusions; first, that the old methodology was <T3>not</T3> designed to enhance Statewide average hourly earnings fromthe USDA survey; and, second, that the fact that the AEWR averaged 20%above the average hourly earnings from the USDA survey in the fourteen``traditional user States'' is an unintended result of the applicationof the various methodologies used in the 1960's to create the AEWR base;it cannot in any way be viewed as a measurement of the quantum of adverseeffect.In all its long history of dealing with AEWRs, DOL has employed a numberof methodologies for setting AEWRs during the different periods of time.None of these methodologies ever has purported to add an enhancement tothe USDA rates. To the contrary, DOL's efforts to set Statewide AEWRs havealways been in response to instances where it was thought that wage depressionexisted in specific crops or activities. (DOL consistently has set StatewideAEWRs. Because of the absence of data from which to measure wage depressionat the local level and becasue of the vast number of different crops, activitiesand areas in which such local AEWRs would have to be set, it was and isadministratively infeasible to set AEWRs for specific crops or activities.)The fact that the pre-June 1, 1987, AEWRs were higher than the USDA averagein most (but not all) States is the <T3>result </T3>of other methodologies that were distinctly different fromthat of adding an explicit enhancement to a Statewide USDA earnings rate.These previous methodologies included setting AEWRs at or <T3>below</T3> the USDA average (early 1960's); assuming that agriculturalwage rates should have increased by the same percentage as manufacturingwage rates (1965); setting an absolute floor and an absolute ceiling aswell, both regardless of the comparison with manufacturing wages (1965);and assuming that the rates in all States should have increased by thesame <T3>absolute</T3> amount (20 cents) as the increase in the national USDArate (1967). These different methodologies do not appear to have measuredwage depression accurately. For example, in 1965, DOL used increase inmanufacturing wages as a proxy for increases in agricultural wages, whichwere believed to be depressed. The application of this methodology ledto AEWRs which were higher than Statewide agricultural earnings in someStates and lower in others. In order to address these erratic results,DOL imposed a minimum and maximum AEWR.If it had been DOL policy to enhance the USDA Statwide or regional rates,some degree of uniformity or consistency of relationship between the oldAEWRs and the USDA rates, or at least some recognizable pattern relatingto estimated presence of illegal aliens, should have been apparent. However,such was clearly not the case. In fact, under the older methodology therewould have been four States (Delaware, Oregon and Washington) in 1987 withAEWRs <T3>below</T3> the applicable USDA average wage rates. These include atleast three States with known heavy concentrations of illegals_Washington,Oregon and Florida. This fact very clearly contradicts any assumption thatDOL has had a longstanding policy of enhancing USDA average wage rates.At the other extreme, there would have been six States with AEWRs 70 percentor more above the USDA rate. None of these States_Nevada, Alabama, Utah,Minnesota, Mississippi, and South Carolina_is noted for high concentrationsof illegal aliens.Moreover, none of the DOL methodologies ever attempted to measure, withany degree of accuracy, the actual amount by which prevailing wages hadbeen depressed (<T3>i.e.</T3>, adversely affected) by the employment of alien workers.They were simply rough efforts to compensate for what DOL believed waswage depression or stagnation caused by the importation of large numbersor workers under the Bracero program. Thus, the historical fact that theapplication of the various methodologies resulted in AEWRs which, in mostcases, were higher than average agricultural wages is merely fortuitous.It does not reflect any determination that these enhancements themselveswere the correct measure of the compensation necessary to eliminate thepast adverse effects caused by the Bracero workers.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Explanation for Retaining the Methodology in the Interim FinalRule</ITAG>Following the DC Circuit's decision in <T3>American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations</T3>v. <T3>Brock, </T3>DOL has extensively reexamined the issues involved in establishingAEWRs for the H-2A program. As explained in the preamble to the June 1,1987, interim final rule, application of the previous methodology (appliedin only 14 States) to a nationwide (49 State) H-2A program would produceinexplicable and unjustifiable results. 52 FR 20404. As a result of theanomalies created by broad application of the old AEWR methodology, DOLdetermined that a new methodology for setting AEWRS is needed, one thatis capable of rational application across the country. DOL promulgatedthe June 1, 1987, methodology, believing that it satisfied this requirement.DOL has chosen to use the USDA survey of farm and livestock workers becauseit presents the best available data on hourly wages in the agriculturalsector. The USDA conducts a scientific quarterly survey of the wages offarm and livstock workers. The survey includes small farms not coveredin other surveys. The scope and frequency of the survey means that allcrops and activities now covered by the H-2A program will be included inthe survey data and that peak work periods also will be covered.Because DOL anticipates that enforcement of IRCA will give rise to a significantexpansion of the H-2A program to new States, crops and activities, DOLhas decided to set AEWRs for all States, except Alaska, for which USDAdata are unavailble. The promulgation of nationwide AEWRs will give newentrants to the H-2A program the opportunity to know in advance the wagesthey will be required to offer if they choose to apply for H-2A workersand will avoid the delays, uncertainties and litigation that have occurredin the past when new States were sought to be added to the H-2A program.In light of the DC Circuit's decision in <T3>American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizaitons</T3>v. <T3>Brock, </T3>DOL has reviewed its past practices in setting AEWRs, asdescribed in Section IV above, and has reviewed the available literatureon the effects of legal and illegal immigration to determine whether, and<T3>to what extent</T3>, wage depression caused by lawful and illegal alienworkers exists in the agricultural labor market. Included in this reviewwere several studies published quite recently. For the reasons outlinedbelow, this analysis has reconfirmed DOL's belief that the June 1, 1987,methodology is valid and appropriate for ensuring that the importationof H-2A workers will not adversely affect the wages of similarly employeddomestic workers.A. Recent Studies Suggest that the Extent of Past Adverse Effect, If Any,From the Employment of Illegal Aliens, Has Been Small and Confined to LocalLabor Markets and Not Reflected to Any Significant Degree in the USDA DataSeries From Which the AEWR Is DerivedWhile DOL has believed that there is a tendency for illegal alien workersto adversely affect wage rates, it cannot disregard recent studies andanalyses which conclude that such effect probably has been minor and localized.Many of these studies were conducted during the past few years, duringthe time IRCA was being debated, prior to enactment, and also since enactment.They have been conducted by some of the most prestigious research and evaluationorganizations, applying the most rigorous state-of-the-art methodologicalstandards. They include studies and analyses performed by the Council ofEconomic Advisers, the General Accounting Office, the National Commissionfor Employment Policy, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the UrbanInstitute, and other prominent individual researchers.The 1986 <T3>Economic Report of the President, </T3>prepared by the Council of EconomicAdvisors, summarizes an extensive review of recent research and economicthinking on wage and employment effects of immigration. The Council's conclusionas to wage effect is mixed:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Some </T3>studies of the effects of immigration on wage levels haverevealed evidence of adverse wage effects. For example, one study concludedthat real wages were 8 to 10 percent lower on average <T3>in cities near the Mexican border. </T3>Several studies found a reductionin the wages of unskilled workers <T3>in areas with high concentrations </T3>of unskilled immigrant workers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Other studies, </T3>however, have shown that greater concentrationsof aliens in labor markets are associated with <T3>higher earnings </T3>of native-born workers. Increased wages have beenfound both for broad groups of workers and also for native-born minoritygroups with whom immigrants might compete directly for jobs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Emphasis added; </ITAG><T3>Id. </T3>at 223)The General Accounting Office (GAO), responding to a Congressional request,surveyed the existing literature on the effects of illegal aliens on thewages and working conditions of legal workers. <T3>(Illegal Aliens: Influence of Illegal Workers on Wages and WorkingConditions of Legal Workers </T3>(GAO/PEMD-88-13BR) (March 1988)). Initially,230 studies were reviewed; these were pared down to 26 which met GAO'sstandards for relevance and analytical rigor. With respect to the question,``Do illegal alien workers depress wages and worsen working conditionsfor native and legal workers?'', GAO came to the following qualified anduncertain conclusion: <ITAG tagnum="21">With regard to the first question, our answer is a qualified ``yes.''Our major finding, based primarily on results from nine case studies, isthat illegal aliens do, <T3>in some cases, </T3>exert downward pressure on wages and working conditionswithin low-wage, low-skilled jobs <T3>in certain labor markets. </T3>The four case studies that supportedthis finding examined illegal alien workers in competition for the samejobs with legal or native workers. Competing native or legal <T3>agricultural workers, </T3>food processing workers, and janitors <T3>in specific labor markets </T3>suffered depressed wages or worsenedworking conditions as employers in these sectors began to hire a higherpercentage of illegal workers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In three <T3>other sectors and labor markets, </T3>the effects of illegal workerson legal or native workers' wages and working conditions overall <T3>could not be determined. </T3>The five case studies on these sectorsor markets provided evidence that the increased supply of workers for <T3>some </T3>job categories, in <T3>some </T3>business and industry sectors such as the garment industry,depressed wages for some native or legal workers but, at the same time,by stimulating business, also expanded employment opportunities and wagesfor <T3>other </T3>legal and native workers in complementary, usually skilledoccupations. None of these studies, however, permitted an assessment ofnet effects. This suggests that the effects of illegal workers on the wagesand working conditions of native or legal workers are not <T3>automatically </T3>in the direction of depressing those conditions,and that those effects depend on a number of factors, of which the illegalstatus of the workers is one.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Emphasis added, except </ITAG><T3>``automatically,'' </T3>which is in original; <T3>Id. </T3>at 1-2)It should be noted that the only wage depression shown in agriculturalemployment cited in the GAO report appeared in two limited, localized,studies of San Diego County, California, pole tomatoes and Ventura County,California, citrus. GAO itself noted that these studies were probably atypical.<ITAG tagnum="21">The case studies also may poorly represent workplaces that employinternational migrants. For example, most of the studies that found wagedepression overall were on unionized settings. Substantial evidence indicatesthat unionization tends to lead to higher wages. In these cases, a partof the effect that illegal aliens may have had on wages was to counteractthe effect that the unions had had on wages.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(</ITAG><T3>Id. </T3>at 64 n 1.)Thus, the wage-depressing effects noted in the studies may have had asmuch to do with anti-union activities as any other motive and might haveoccurred even if the non-union workers been legal workers.Further, GAO pointed out that other economic forces also may come intoplay in determining whether the removal of illegal workers will necessarilyraise wages:<ITAG tagnum="21">[O]ne cannot assume that the absence of illegal aliens would, in allcases, cause an increase in wages and job opportunties for native workers.In some cases, the higher wages necessary to bring workers into a givenlabor market would possibly raise the employer's costs to a level thatprevents the employer from competing effectively with foreign producers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(</ITAG><T3>Id. </T3>at 64)It also must be noted that DOL submitted critical comments on the draftGAO Report. <T3>Id. </T3>at 57-62. These comments were directed at the adequacy ofthe GAO analysis with respect to adverse impacts of employing illegal workersin specific occupations and activities in local labor markets. These commentsdid not take issue with the GAO finding that the effects of employing illegalworkers are difficult to detect at levels of analysis beyond specific activitiesin local labor markets.The National Commission for Employment Policy also reviewed the availableliterature in 1986 and came to a similar qualified conclusion (<T3>Illegal Immigrants and Refugees_Their Economic Adaptation and Impacton Local U.S. Labor Markets: A Review of the Literature </T3>(October 1986)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The evidence regarding the labor market impact of undocumented entrantsis <T3>mixed and somewhat inconclusive. </T3>Undocumented workers do displacesome native-born U.S. workers and do lower wages and working conditionsin <T3>some </T3>occupations and <T3>geographical areas. </T3>The opportunities for U.S. workers sometimesare reduced where undocumented workers dominate segments of the labor market.On the other hand, undocumented workers in some instances create and perpetuatejobs for themselves as well as for some U.S. workers. Furthermore, theyhelp to preserve some U.S. firms that, without such a supply of foreignlabor, might move their operations overseas. <T3>The evidence is not conclusive regarding the overall or aggregate effectson the labor market. </T3>Rather the evidence suggests that the labor marketeffects of undocumented workers may best be viewed as <T3>a series of local and regional effects which vary widely.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Emphasis added; </ITAG><T3>Id. </T3>at vii)The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has just completed a two-yearresearch project on the inter-nationalization of the U.S. labor market,including the impact of immigration on wages and employment.

Employmentand wages of less educated black and white natives have not worsened noticeablyin cities in which immigrant shares of the population rose in the 1970's,while on the positive side, there is some evidence that less skilled nativeshave moved out of low-wage service and manufacturing industries and thatthese industries have grown more rapidly or declined more slowly in citieswith more immigrants (Altonji and Card). The broad implication is that<T3>immigrants have been absorbed into the American labor market with littleadverse impact on natives.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Emphasis added; </ITAG><T3>Id. </T3>at 7)An Urban Institute study of the impact of the large population of Mexicansimmigrating, both legally and illegally, into Southern California foundthe following with respect to effect on wages (<T3>The Fourth Wave: California's Newest Immigrants </T3>(1985)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The presence of Mexicans and, in all likelihood, of other immigrantgroups, reduced the average wages in manufacturing and <T3>some </T3>services, both in Los Angeles and elsewhere in California.This reduction in average wages primarily reflects the increasing shareof Hispanics in the work force, since wages for this group are lower thanfor non-Hispanics in similar occupations. We also conclude that the presenceof immgrants has <T3>somewhat depressed the wages of non-hispanics </T3>working as laborers,but the impact on the <T3>wages paid to non-Hispanics </T3>in semi-skilled occupations <T3>appears to be negligible. </T3>The principal reasons why immgrantsreceived lower wages are that they are less likely to be unionized andthey have less experience and education than other workers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Emphasis added; </ITAG><T3>Id. </T3>at 123)Specifically with respect to agriculture, Dr. Phillip L. Martin, Professorof Agricultural Economics, University of California at Davis, in a studyconducted for DOL, raises serious doubts as to whether illegal aliens haveadversely affected agricultural wage rates (<T3>IRCA and the U.S. Farm Labor Market </T3>(February 1988)):<ITAG tagnum="21">If illegal alien workers are replaced by U.S. citizens, legal immigrants,and legal non-immigrants, there will be <T3>offsetting effects on farm wages. </T3>Generally, the illegal aliensand the legal non-immigrants are ``solo men'' (in the U.S. without families);such workers <T3>tend to earn more per hour at pervailing piece rates than more diverseU.S. workers. </T3>Some illegal aliens are ``isolated and powerless;''to the extent that such illegal aliens are replaced by other workers, thereshould be upward pressure on farm wages.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Emphasis added; </ITAG><T3>Id. </T3>at 1)Dr. Martin states in the same report, ``<T3>The evidence of these possible wage-depressing effects of illegalsis sparse. </T3>[Emphasis added.]'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 8. As indicated above, one of the main reasons for Dr.Martin's doubt about adverse effect is the fact that aliens often havehigher productivity than U.S. workers, so that when paid by the piece theiraverage hourly earnings exceed those of U.S. workers, thus possibly evenraising the average wage rate. As he states, ``Illegal alien farmworkerstend to be young men; such solo men tend to be the most productive farmworkersin the sense that <T3>they have higher-than-average hourly earnings at prevailing piece rates.</T3>[Emphasis added.]'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 14.Even if there may have been adverse effects on agricultural wages fromthe employment of illegal aliens, they apparently have been so concentratedin specific crops, activities, and areas that such effects do not appearto be reflected to any significant degree in the USDA data series, whichincludes all agricultural activities, usually in multi-State regions. Dr.Martin states as his first major conclusion in his 1988 study cited above:<ITAG tagnum="21">The removal of illegal alien workers should raise farm wages. However,illegal alien workers ar not uniformly distributed throughout agriculture;instead, they are concentrated in particular tasks, commodities, areas,and on certain farms. Thus the <T3>wage increases traceable to the removal of illegal alien workers maynot be apparent in regularly-published wage data </T3>such as <T3>Farm Labor.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Emphasis added; </ITAG><T3>Id. </T3>at 1)Clearly, if the removal of illegal aliens may not signficantly affect theUSDA wage data, their presence also may not affect this series to any significantextent. (Note: The USDA periodical <T3>Farm Labor </T3>is the publication containing the USDA data serieson which AEWRs are based.)This view is strongly supported by the 1988 GAO report cited above:<ITAG tagnum="21">Our experience in the prior synthesis on illegal workers (GAO/PEMD-86-9BR)suggested the general lesson that <T3>wage depresssion is harder and harder to detect at levels of analysisbeyond or above a highly localized and occupation-specific labor market.</T3>For example, we found evidence of displacement of legal citrus pickersby illegal ones in Ventura County, California, but those effects probablywould not be evident in data on agricultural workers in central Californiagenerally and even less so at higher levels of aggregation such as unskilledworkers in the state. Thus, case studies that concentrate on specific industriesor sectors in labor markets in specific communities may be better ableto detect wage depression than aggregate data.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[Emphasis added; <T3>Id. </T3>at 10.] </ITAG>Evidence suggesting that the USDA eage rates have not been affected significantlyby the presumably lower wages paid to illegals is provided by State averagewage data from that USDA data series itself. An examination of averageagricultural earnings in the six States most likely to have the highestconcentrations of undocumented workers, as measured by the highest concentrationof seasonal crop workers, and as shown in the USDA data published in <T3>Farm Labor, </T3>does not reveal a consistent pattern of depressionin the USDA earnings data over time. Over the 1974-87 period (the longestperiod with consistent USDA survey data), average agricultural earningsin North Carolina, Oregon. Texas and Washington increased by more thanthe national average. Only Califronia and Florida had increases that werebelow the national average. However, the absolute level of wage rates inboth California and Florida is well above the national average. B. The AEWR Methodology in the Interim Final Rule Is Justified By the AvailableEvidence From DOL's review of the available information on the agricultural labormarket, DOL views the data and literature as inconclusive on the issueof adverse effect or wage depression from the presence of illegal alienworkers on the USDA data series. This inconclusiveness is due, in part,to statistical difficulties in measuring wage depression, but also reflectsthe fact that data on illegal workers are nearly impossible to obtain forpurposes of measuring any possible wage depression caused by such workers.DOL is aware of no study that has quantified or measured any wage depressionat any aggregate level such as the State or the region. To the extent thatthere is some anecdotal evidence of wage depression from these sources,the evidence also suggests that the adverse effects are highly localizedand concentrated in specific areas and crop activities. The evidence furthersuggests that because of the nature of the illegal alien workforce, andbecause of the concentration of that workforce in particular localitiesand crops, such adverse effects as may exist are not reflected, to anysubstantial extent, if at all, in USDA average wage data. Thus, DOL concludes that setting the AEWR at the level of average agriculturalwages, as determined by the USDA survey, is the correct approach. To theextent that wage depression does exist on a concentrated local basis, theaverage agricultural wage does not appear to be significantly affectedby this wage depression. Further, none of the studies reviewed by DOL herequantified or measured any wage depression that might exist in the USDAdata series. This series is, therefore, the appropriate source of ratesto use to set the AEWR. Based on all of the information available, thereis no justification for adding any enhancement to the USDA average agriculturalwage. Such an explicit enhancement could only be justified if alien agriculturalemployment has depressed average agricultural earnings, and if the extentof the depression can be measured at the aggregate level. Even though the evidence is not conclusive on the existence of past adverseeffect, DOL still believes that its statutory responsibility to U.S. workerswill be discharged best by the adoption of an AEWR set at the USDA averageagricultural wage in order to protect against the possibility that theanticipated expansion of the H-2A program will itself create wage depressionor stagnation. As pointed out in the preamble to the June 1, 1987, interim final rule,the old methodology had resulted in anomalies among the State rates whichcould not be explained in any rational manner relating to presence of illegalaliens and past adverse effect. See 52 FR at 20504. In light of: (1) Therecent studies cited earlier which indicate that it is highly questionableas to whether and how much adverse effect has occurred from the use ofillegal aliens; (2) the likelihood that any adverse effect which mighthave occured may not be reflected in the USDA data series; and (3) theapparent anomalies in that old AEWR methodoogy, it is clear that addingto that USDA average any enhancement factor comparable to that resultingfrom the old methodology_such as the observed 20 percent average in the14 States for which old AEWRs were published_would be inappropriate. Evenif one were to assume (despite the absence of evidence) that there hasbeen some adverse effect on the USDA rates in States with larger concentrationsof illegal aliens, applying an enhancement factor across-the-board to allStates clearly would be inequitable and inappropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Other Considerations in Developing an AEWR Methodology</ITAG>DOL must assume that IRCA will achieve its stated purpose of removing illegalaliens from the labor force. See 8 U.S.C. 1324a. (One might note that AEWRs,if set too high, might be a disincentive to the use of H-2A and U.S. workers,and could undermine efforts to eradicate the employment of illegal aliens.)Agricultural employers who have employed illegal alien workers in the pastthen must fill their labor needs with U.S. workers (including special agriculturalworkers authorized under IRCA) or with H-2A workers. All of these willbe covered by various wage and working condition protections, and the totalnumber may well fall short of the pre-IRCA agricultural labor force. Thesechanged conditions could tend to create upward pressures on agriculturalwage rates.Within this context, the AEWR requirement in the H-2A program could contributeto upward wage pressures. Non-H-2A employers will be forced to competefor workers with H-2A employers at the wage rates required in the H-2Aprogram. Using the USDA average as the AEWR will probably have some ``ratcheting''effect on wages, as the previous year's <T3>average </T3>becomes the current year's <T3>minimum. </T3>This will be particularly true if the number of coveredworkers (H-2A workers and their U.S. co-workers) at the wage rates requiredin the H-2A program expands significantly. As a result, requiring an enhancementto the USDA average rate as the AEWR could increase labor costs of employersof H-2A workers and weaken their ability to compete with foreign imports.Lower domestic production could reduce the demand for labor, adverselyaffecting both wages and job opportunities for U.S. workers whom IRCA wasdesigned to protect.These effects would also be inconsistent with the purpose of the laborcertification process, as recognized by the courts, that the temporaryforeign worker regulations are ``to promote a manageable scheme * * * thatis fair to both sides.'' <T3>Flecha </T3>v. <T3>Quiros, </T3>567 F. 2d 1154, 1156 (1st Cir. 1977). As part of the laborcertification process, the setting of AEWRs must balance the needs andinterests of U.S. workers and U.S. employers. See <T3>Flecha </T3>v. <T3>Quiros, </T3>567 F. 2d at 1155-1156; <T3>Rogers </T3>v. <T3>Larsen, </T3>563 F. 2d 617, 626 (3rd Cir. 1977); and <T3>Elton Orchards, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Brennan, </T3>508 F. 2d 493 (1st Cir. 1974). The IRCA amendments to the INA do not change the role and effect of thestatutory policy to protect the wages of similarly employed U.S. agriculturalworkers from the adverse effect which may result from the employment ofalien workers. Under the H-2A program, as under the H-2 program beforeit,<ITAG tagnum="20">[t]he common purposes [of the program] * * * are to assure [employers]an adequate labor force on the one hand and to protect the jobs of citizenson the other. Any statutory scheme with these two purposes must inevitablystrike a balance between the two goals. Clearly, citizen-workers wouldbest be protected and assured high wages if no aliens were allowed to enter.Conversely, elimination of all restrictions upon entry would most effectivelyprovide employers with an ample labor force.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Rogers </T3>v. <T3>Larsen, </T3>563 F. 2d 617, 626 (3d Cir. 1977); <T3>Flecha </T3>v. <T3>Quiros, </T3>567 F. 2d at 1154.

DOL believes that the June1, 1987, methodology is the appropriate method by which to set AEWRs inlight of its obligations to balance the needs of U.S. workers and U.S.employers and in light of its great discretion to develop any reasonableformula to set AEWRs.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Conclusion</ITAG>The AEWR is the minimum wage rate that agricultural employers seeking nonimmigrantalien workers must offer to and pay their U.S. and alien workers, if prevailingwages and any federal or State minimum wage rates are below the AEWR. TheAEWR is a wage floor, and the existence of an AEWR does not prevent theworker from seeking a higher wage or the employer from paying a higherwage.The purpose of an AEWR, as described by the U.S. Court of Appeals for theFifth Circuit, is ``to neutralize an `adverse effect' resultant from theinflux of temporary foreign workers.'' It is a ``method of avoiding wagedeflation.'' <T3>Williams </T3>v. <T3>Usery, </T3>531 F.2d 305, 306 (5th Cir. 1976), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>429 U.S. 1000; see <T3>Florida Sugar Cane League, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Usery, </T3>531 F.2d 299 (5th Cir. 1976); see also <T3>Production Farm Management </T3>v. <T3>Brock, </T3>767 F.2d 1368 (9th Cir. 1985); <T3>Limoneira Co. </T3>v. <T3>Wirtz, </T3>225 F.

Supp. 210 (D.D.C. 1961); and 20 CFR 655.0) (1986).The AEWR thus ensures that the wages of similarly employed U.S. workerswill not be adversely affected by the lawful importation of temporary,nonimmigrant alien workers. For the reasons outlined above, DOL believesthat the June 1, 1987, methodology satisfies DOL's duties under IRCA toensure that the importation of H-2A workers does not adversely affect thewages of similarly employed domestic workers.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Request for Comments</ITAG>DOL requests comments on the proposed rule. Specifically, any additionalstudies or evidence as to known and measured wage depression reflectedin the USDA data series caused by the presence in the agricultural workforce of illegal aliens will be very helpful to enable DOL to further examinethe conclusions drawn from the materials reviewed. While most of the studiescited in this document are publicly available, the study by Dr. Martinis not available generally. DOL has supplied copies of the Martin studyto the parties in the <T3>AFL-CIO</T3> v. <T3>Brock</T3> litigation and will supply, upon request, copies to anyother interested person. Copies may be obtained by writing to or callingthe contact person listed at the beginning of this document.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact</ITAG>This document affects only those employers using nonimmigrant aliens workers(H-2A visaholders) in temporary agricultural jobs in the United States.It does not have the financial or other impact to make it a major ruleand, therefore, the preparation of a regulatory impact analysis is notnecessary. See Executive Order No. 12291, 3 CFR 1981 Comp., p. 127, 5 U.S.C.601 note.The Department of Labor has notified the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, SmallBusiness Administration, and made the certification pursuant to the RegulatoryFlexibility Act at 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that this proposed rule does not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This document contains no paperwork requirements which mandate clearanceunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This program is listed in the <T3>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</T3> as Number 17.202, ``Certificationof Foreign Workers for Agricultural and Logging Employment.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 655</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agriculture, Aliens, Employment,Forest and forest products, Guam, Labor, Migrant labor, Wages.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule</ITAG>Accordingly, Part 655 of Chapter V of Title 20, Code of Federal Regulations,is proposed to be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 655_LABOR CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR THE TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENTOF ALIENS IN THE UNITED STATES</ITAG>1.
