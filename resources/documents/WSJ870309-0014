The dollar rose against most other major currencies Friday, aided by U.S. emloyment statistics that were slightly better than expected. Nonetheless, the currency continued to trade within a narrow range.    As for sterling, some traders believe that the British currency is close to topping out for the near term following last week's rally. But many say that relatively high British interest rates and continued stability in the value of other major currencies against one another will keep attention on the pound.    &quot;We're still going to see some demand for sterling. That's been the big game lately,&quot; says J. Steven Stekly, a Bank of Boston trader.    In late New York trading Friday, the pound stood at $1.5853, up from $1.5838 the day before and 2.4% above its level of a week earlier. Sterling's gains against its European counterparts were even sharper. Against the West German currency, for instance, the pound climbed 0.7% Friday, to 2.9254 marks from 2.9047 Thursday. On the week, the pound gained 3.5% against the mark.    The pound is being aided by British interest rates, which are higher than those in other major countries; expectations that a British tax cut will be proposed next week; and what is perceived to be increased stability for the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.    In the dollar's case, meanwhile, concern that central banks might intervene in support of the currency has discouraged aggressive selling despite bearish U.S. economic indicators in recent weeks. One exception to the bearish statistics was Friday's employment report for February, which showed the U.S. jobless rate unchanged at 6.7% and a robust increase of 337,000 in nonfarm payroll employment.    The intervention expectations stem from an accord aimed at stabilizing exchange rates announced Feb. 22 by the six biggest industrial nations. Finance ministers from the countries -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada -- were meeting in Paris.    &quot;By no means are we out of the range that we've been in in the past two weeks&quot; for the dollar, says Joseph F. Teel, a trader at Fidelity Bank, Philadelphia.    The dollar climbed to 1.8453 marks Friday from 1.8340 Thursday, and to 153.70 Japanese yen from 153.33.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery fell $1 an ounce, to $406.20, in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $407.90 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                         CURRENCY RATES                            New York   Home Mkt.
