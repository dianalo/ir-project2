On a voice vote, the House passed a measure directing theFederal Aviation Administration to step up its research on aircraftsafety, including fire prevention and the problems faced by agingplanes.   The bill requires the FAA to increase its research on post-crashfire prevention, and directs the agency to consider writing a rulethat would require airlines to make aircraft fuel tanks that areless prone to fire.   The structural soundness of aging aircraft would be anothercategory of required research. The provision was inspired by theApril 28 accident in which the roof of an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737peeled off in flight, sweeping a flight attendant to her death andinjuring 61 of 94 people on board before the plane landed safely.   The bill would also require added research on the role humanperformance plays in aircraft safety. Among the items the FAA wouldhave to examine would be the standards the agency uses to determinehow many air traffic controllers it believes are needed.   Overall, the bill directs the FAA to reserve 15 percent of itsresearch budget, or about $21 million, for long-term research. TheSenate passed the measure on Thursday.   On a 355-1 vote, the House approved legislation aimed at helpingprivate satellite launchers, who have been battered ever since theChallenger space shuttle disaster of January 1986.   The bill requires commercial launchers of satellites to obtaininsurance to cover potential losses by private companies andindividuals up to $500 million. The government's liability would belimited to $1.5 billion beyond the insured level.   Launchers would also have to obtain up to $100 million ininsurance to cover possible damage to government property.   To help U.S. companies that had agreements with NASA to launchsatellites when the Challenger explosion occurred, the measurewould exempt those firms from having to obtain insurance againstdamage to federal property.   The sole vote against the measure was cast by Rep. HenryGonzalez, D-Texas, who said he was uncomfortable with what he saidwould amount to government subsidies to private companies in thebill.   In August 1986, Reagan ordered NASA to halt launches ofcommercial and foreign satellites. At that time, 44 companies hadagreements with NASA to launch satellites on the shuttle, and halfof them had space vehicles already under construction.   The measure also bars the government from pre-empting privatelaunches, as it did after the Challenger catastrophe, except forcases of ``imperative national need.'' The bill would prevent theimposition of extra federal charges on companies if their launch ispre-empted by the government. It would also require NASA to reportto Congress within a week on the reasons for the pre-emption andproviding a new launch schedule.   The legislation passed the Senate on a voice vote on Oct. 14.   On a 353-0 tally, the House also approved a measure ordering theWhite House to draft a five-year plan for federal research onsuperconductivity.   Recent years have seen a dramatic growth in federal and privateefforts in the field, with scientists beginning to producematerials allowing the transmission of electricity at levels ofefficiency that are now unattainable. Such advances couldrevolutionize energy storage, electronics, transportation and otherindustries.   Critics, however, have said the government's work has beenunfocused. The bill would give the White House nine months to writeits research plan.   The Senate passed the bill Oct. 5.</TEXT></DOC>
