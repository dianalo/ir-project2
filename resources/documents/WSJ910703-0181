After more than three years of fairly steady growth,assets started to decline, as yields fell to the lowest pointin more than five years and investors looked for betterreturns elsewhere.</LP><TEXT>   Only the so-called government money funds, which investexclusively in Treasury and government-agency securities,grew in the second quarter. Assets of those funds increasedabout 6% during the three months, to nearly $75 billion,according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.   Assets of other taxable money funds, meanwhile, declinedabout 4%, to $374.7 billion on June 25, the Holliston, Mass.,newsletter says.   The outlook isn't much better in the current quarter.While a number of portfolio managers think short-terminterest rates are at or near bottom, they don't expect asharp upturn any time soon.   Money funds &quot;are only a conduit,&quot; says Joseph DiMartino,president of Dreyfus Corp. and manager of its WorldwideDollar money fund. &quot;We can only {pass along} what we get.&quot;   To attract money-fund investors with somewhat higheryields, several mutual fund groups are considering new kindsof funds that won't meet the Securities and ExchangeCommission's definition of a money fund because of thequality or maturity of their investments.   &quot;The question for managers is what are we going to do tokeep our shareholders from heading for the door becauseyields are so low,&quot; says Edward Wiese, portfolio manager ofT. Rowe Price Associates' Prime Reserve Fund.   Indeed, investors have been pouring money into short-termand intermediateterm bond funds, which offer a percentagepoint or two more in yield at only a modest increase in risk.The Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group,reported last week that investors added $5 billion to allbond funds in May alone.   The average seven-day compound yield on taxable moneyfunds open to individual investors was 5.57% for the quarter,according to estimates by IBC/Donoghue's. That's down almosta percentage point from the first quarter -- and just barelymore than investors can get on passbook savings accounts.(Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.)   Risk-conscious investors who opt for the added safety ofgovernment-only money funds currently don't have to give upmuch yield for the extra margin of protection. At 5.53% lastweek, the average seven-day compound yield on government-onlyfunds is only a fraction of a percentage point lower than theaverage yield on other taxable funds open to individuals. Sixgovernment-only funds were yielding more than 6% last week,and three of the top-10 performers for the quarter weregovernment funds, according to IBC/Donoghue's.   What's more, funds that invest exclusively in Treasurybills generally are exempt from state and local taxation,thereby boosting their effective yield. &quot;Sometimes the safestfunds are also the highest yielding,&quot; says William E.Donoghue, publisher of Money Fund Report.   Safety continues to be an issue for money-fund investors,still spooked by commercial paper defaults in 1989 and 1990that forced sponsors or investment advisers to bail out adozen funds. On June 1 of this year new SEC regulations tookeffect, limiting money funds' investments in all buttop-rated securities to 5% of their portfolios.   Most funds had already moved to comply with the newregulations, which had been discussed for more than a year.Indeed, by the end of June, only 21 of 394 funds open toindividuals were holding any &quot;second-tier&quot; paper, and onlyone had more than 5%. (The regulations permit funds to holdsecurities purchased before June 1 until maturity.) Themanager of that fund, Pacifica Money Market Fund, has saidthat the fund will be holding only top-rated securities bythe end of August.   The effect of the new regulations is to reduce yields,although not much, fund managers say. In the past, R. Meederandamp; Associates' Flex-fund, for instance, typically had about aquarter to a third of its assets in second-tier securities,says Jay Mueller, portfolio manager. With second-tier papercurrently yielding less than a fifth of a percentage pointmore than first-tier, he says the net effect on the fund'syield is probably about five-hundredths of a percentagepoint.   The average seven-day compound yield of funds holdingsecond-tier paper was about a tenth of a percentage pointhigher last week than the average for all taxable funds.   Fund managers say the new regulations will toughencompetition, by smoothing out the differences among funds'investments. &quot;The only way {left} to compete on net yield isthrough cost,&quot; says Neal Litvack, a marketing vice presidentfor Fidelity Investments. &quot;You can pick up 40 or 50 basispoints {hundredths of a percentage point} by choosing a lowcost fund.&quot;   The average money fund charges investors 0.64% of assetsfor management fees and expenses, according to Donoghue's.   Still, fund managers predict that few funds will boostyields by absorbing fees and expenses for long periods. &quot;It'svery expensive,&quot; says Mr. DiMartino of Dreyfus, whoseWorldwide Dollar fund started phasing in fees and expensesmore than two years after it was introduced.   Mr. Litvack of Fidelity predicts that other funds willexperiment with the Spartan funds' strategy of charging forthings like check-writing. Flex-fund's Mr. Mueller says fundswill opt to try to cut costs for things like transfer-agentfees.   Waivers of a portion of fees and expenses are likely tocontinue, however. All 10 of the top performers for thequarter waived at least part of their fees.   Every half a percentage point means more when short-terminterest rates, and money-fund yields, are low. &quot;Everyone'ssquirming for the last little tick right now,&quot; says Mr.Mueller. &quot;If short rates go back up to 9% or 10%, no one willnotice.&quot;   ---               Monitoring Money-Market Funds                                                                                                          A look at consumer-oriented money funds and some of theirholdings in the second quarter.
