On the New York Stock Exchange, the New York StockExchange Composite Index rose 3.49, or 1.82%, and the DowJones Industrial Average jumped 42.57, or 1.53%.   Robert O'Toole, head of OTC institutional sales at LehmanBrothers, said the recent cuts in interest rates continue tospur buying in the over-the-counter market. Investors &quot;haveput (the war) on the back burner; interest rates are thekey,&quot; he said.   Many investors are moving money into stocks as the lowerrates reduce returns from investments such as money marketaccounts, Mr. O'Toole said.   &quot;There is so much strength in the market you have tobelieve that (the recent advance) is not a rally within abear market; it's the start of a new bull market,&quot; said JamesTarantino, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht andamp; Quist in SanFrancisco.   He characterized trading yesterday as a &quot;buying panic.It's just incredible; there is a lot of money out there.&quot;   Among big gainers were Microsoft, which added 4 1/2 to a52-week high of 105 3/4, and Sun Microsystems, which rose 13/8 to 31. Goldman Sachs analysts made positive commentsabout both companies.   But traders said a correction is inevitable and added thatsome investors have begun to take their profits.   Lehman Brothers' Mr. O'Toole said that while he doesn'texpect any market pullback to be deep, he expects some easingin the market by week's end. &quot;I think it would be healthy ifwe had a correction. You can't keep going straight up or youend up coming straight down,&quot; he said.   Alfred E. Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G.Edwards andamp; Sons, said OTC shares have risen too far, too fast.He recommends some investors take profits in the stocks thathave posted the biggest gains -- such as the technology- andhealthcare-related issues.   A.G. Edwards' Mr. Goldman said a market correction &quot;willcome in where it is least likely to happen, and any placeexcept where the majority is thinking&quot; it will.   While Mr. Goldman says &quot;there is no way to call the top&quot;of the rally in the OTC market, he sees the advancecontinuing among Big Board issues until the Dow JonesIndustrial Average reaches the area of its all-time high justunder 3000.   Mr. Goldman said the &quot;risk-to-reward ratio&quot; for investingin OTC stocks short term has turned negative, meaning thereis more risk in investing in shares at their current levelsthan there are potential benefits from such investments.   MIPS Computer added 1 1/8 to 14 1/4. After the marketclosed Tuesday, MIPS reported a fourth-quarter loss of twocents a share against year-ago net of 12 cents.
