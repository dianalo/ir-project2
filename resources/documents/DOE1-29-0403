Studies have shown that the passageof free gas into the combined solid state is possible in the permafrostregions of the northern and eastern USSR, in the upper part of the sedimentarysection, where formation-temperatures are low. It has been pointed outthat the zone of hydrate-formation (ZHF), that is, the upper part ofthe sedimentary section in which the formation and accumulation of gas-hydratestakes place, is approximately coextensive with the permafrost region,or an area of about 6.5 x 10{sup 6} km{sup 2}. This paper evaluates hydraterelated prospects of this wide area, and for the first time an attemptis made at an approximate qualitative and quantitative estimate of theprospects for gas in the ZHF in the USSR. It has demonstrated that itspotential gas-bearing area, both as a whole, and also on the basis oflocal sites, may prove of definite interest in increasing the reservesof natural gas in the country, from depths of not more than 1000-1500m. 5 references.</TEXT></DOC>
