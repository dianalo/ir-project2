The extentto which these changes are important in the expression of radiation damageand its repair remains unclear. We have quantitated changes in the parenchymallevels of collagen types I, III, and IV in the lungs of LAF1 mice atintervals to 1 year, following doses of 0-14 Gy, 300 kV X rays, or 0-18Gy in the presence of the radioprotective compound, WR-2721. The methodof quantitation, which involves video image analysis of fluorescent antibodystained, cryostat tissue sections, provides both quantitative and morphologicalinformation for the three collagen isotypes. Type I collagen peaked intissue content at 15 and 30 weeks postirradiation (p.i.), with transientreturn to control values 20-25 weeks p.i. Type III collagen peaked at15 and 25 weeks p.i. and declined in tissue content at 20 and 30 weeks.Type IV peaked 15-20 weeks following irradiation, returned to controllevels at 25 weeks, and reached a plateau above control values after30 weeks. Fluctuations in collagen levels in the parenchyma were dosedependent but were not simultaneous, indicating a radiation responsecharacterized by alpha-chain-specific regulation of collagen biosynthesisand breakdown. In general, WR-2721, which enhanced postirradiation survival(DMF, 1.3), reduced the magnitude and altered the timing of collagenfluctuations; again, the effects were type specific. The results clearlydemonstrate that the postirradiation response of the connective tissueis dose dependent, is specific to each macromolecule, and involves bothdeposition and removal of extracellular matrix. These processes are independentlyinfluenced by the presence during irradiation of WR-2721.</TEXT></DOC>
