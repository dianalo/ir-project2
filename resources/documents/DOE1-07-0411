Analysis of such a system must demonstratea clear advantage in order to justify the additional complexity, usuallygreater capital cost and, in some cases organisational and marketingdifficulties in handling the energy products. The approach of the thermodynamicanalysis involves the separation of losses into those of which furtheruse may be made (exergy) and those which are not recoverable. Irreversibilitythrough large temperature differences is noted as one cause of loss intraditional plant which dual systems can minimise. Examples of applicationsare given from compound plant gas and steam turbine cycles; combinedheat and power steam plant; Rankine bottoming cycles and compound cyclesfor diesel engines; and the engine-driven heat pump.</TEXT></DOC>
