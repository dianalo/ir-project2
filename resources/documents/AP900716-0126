Note contents.</NOTE><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A young man accused of killing and dismembering a15-year-old runaway said he didn't realize the implications of whathe'd done until he showed a friend a gruesome souvenir, a newspaperreported.   The souvenir was the severed and skinned head of Stephanie Dubay.   ``I went to the freezer and got it. It was still warm,'' JaimeRodriguez Jr. told The Detroit News in a telephone interview fromthe suburban Macomb County Jail.   The female friend took the head to police headquarters in Warren.   ``When I finally realized what I had done was when she left withthe head,'' he told the newspaper.   Rodriguez, 21, was being held without bond on charges offirst-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder andmutilation of a human body in Wednesday's slaying.   His A 15-year-old cousin, Augustine Pena, was arraigned as anadult Monday in 37th District Court on one count each offirst-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and mutilation ofa human body.   Dubay, 15, of Clinton Township, was reported missing June 26.She had briefly shared a Warren home with Rodriguez, the cousin andthe cousin's mother after running away from home.   Rodriguez told The News that he has been involved in satanismfor about six years. But he said Dubay was slain on a whim, not aspart of any ritual, the newspaper reported Sunday.   ``Me and my cousin were sitting at the table Wednesdaymorning,'' Rodriguez said, according to the newspaper. ``He said,`Let's kill Steph.' I said, `You serious?' He said, `Yeah.'''   Rodriguez said he and his cousin went to the basement and placednewspapers on the floor ``in case there was a mess.'' He said hiscousin went upstairs, woke Dubay and brought her to the basement,where he held her by the neck while the cousin stabbed her, thenewspaper reported.   Rodriguez said neither he nor his cousin verbally suggested thedismemberment.   ``We just read each other's minds and went for it,'' Rodriguezsaid.   Dubay was decapitated, her head skinned and placed in thefreezer. The index finger was severed from her right hand, whichalso had been removed.   ``I wanted a finger for a charm, to wear around my neck. It hassomething to do with my beliefs, but not really. ... It's somethingelse, really, that I don't want to talk about.''   But Rodriguez spoke in general terms about his involvement withsatanism: ``I guess I needed a new god. God gave up on me, so Igave up on Him and went out and found a new god, one that wouldlove me.''   Records show that on Aug. 30, 1987, Rodriguez's mother fatallyshot herself at their Saginaw home.   Conviction on both the murder and conspiracy charges ispunishable by life in prison; mutilation carries up to 10 years'imprisonment. Rodriguez said he expected to spend the rest of hislife in prison, but he expressed no remorse over the slaying.   ``I've come close to this feeling,'' he told The News. ``It'snot a feeling of pity or remorse or anything like that. It's notlike I'm feeling bad inside for it. I'm not happy for it.''</TEXT></DOC>
