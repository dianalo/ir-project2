Newspapers called on Nicaraguans to maintain a combat alert incase U.S. troops invaded from Honduras, where 3,200 American troopsbegan arriving Thursday.   The Foreign Ministry blamed the United States for a Honduranattack on Sandinista army targets and formally protested toWashington. The raid came less than two hours after the firstAmerican troops landed in Honduras.   Contra leaders said cease-fire talks scheduled Monday with thegovernment were off unless the Sandinistas left Honduras.Nicaraguan radio reported that anti-aircraft batteries fired on twounidentified aircraft spotted flying in from Honduras on Thursdaynight.   Barricada, the official newspaper of the ruling SandinistaNational Liberation Front, said neighborhood defense committeesheld meetings and renewed arms instruction.   ``The order of the day: Intensify combats,'' read a headline inBarricada. Newspapers also reported that young Nicaraguan men werevolunteering for military service.   Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of the Nicaraguan ForeignMinistry, told ``CBS This Morning:'' ``The Hondurans attacked,bombed our position yesterday. This is one step that could lead toanother. Those (American) troops are not there on a sightseeingmission.   ``If we don't defend the Central American peace plan, ifHonduras does not shut down the Contra operations and the UnitedStates does not end its military involvement, one step could leadto another,'' he said in an interview from Managua.   President Daniel Ortega said Thursday his army was ready to``combat and liquidate'' U.S. troops if America engaged theSandinista forces. But the United States has said American troopswon't go near the area of hostilities, along theHonduran-Nicaraguan border.   Sandinista officers said two bombs fell in Nicaragua and a thirdlanded across the narrow Coco River in Honduran territory onThursday afternoon. Reporters taken to the area by a Sandinistaofficial saw at least five bombs fall, but it was impossible to saywhich side of the border they landed on.   A Reagan administration source in Washington said the Honduranair force had carried out the attack.   In Tegucigalpa, a Honduran armed forces spokesman said rocketswere fired at Sandinista forces in Honduran territory, not inNicaragua.   The journalists dived for cover as the jets roared in and thebombs struck as close as 70 yards away.   The raid occurred one day after Honduras and the United Statesaccused Nicaraguan troops of crossing into Honduras in pursuit ofContra rebels.   Bendana and Defense Ministry officials have denied theallegation, and Ortega has neither denied nor admitted it.   The U.S. soldiers were deployed in what the United States calleda ``measured response'' to the alleged Nicaraguan incursion.   Ortega said Sandinista troops would not withdraw fromNicaragua's border and were maintaining an offensive begun March 8,in which an estimated 2,000 Contras had been pushed out ofNicaraguan territory.   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said Ortega sent a diplomaticnote to Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``formally andenergetically protesting'' the Thursday attack.   The note assails what it calls the raid's ``terroristcharacter,'' saying the raid ``put in danger the lives of numerousjournalists, including North American citizens.''   Later, state-run Voice of Nicaragua radio reported that at leasttwo unidentified aircraft flying in from Honduras were spotted overthe Pacific coast port of Corinto, about 71 miles northwest ofManagua, at 7:05 p.m.   It said anti-aircraft batteries opened fire on the planes.   In Miami on Thursday, a Contra leader says truce talks scheduledto begin on Monday are off unless Sandinista troops withdraw fromHonduras.   ``If this situation does not take a radical turn, we will notattend,'' said Aristides Sanchez, a member of the five-memberdirectorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrellaorganization.</TEXT></DOC>
