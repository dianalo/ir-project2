(Respondent) of 128 West Pine Street,Ponchatoula, Louisiana 70454, proposing to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificateof Registration AA7218488 and deny any pending applications for its renewal.The statutory predicate for the Order to Show Cause was Respondent's convictionon January 28, 1987, in the United States District Court for the EasternDistrict of Louisiana of distribution of hydromorphone (Dilaudid), in violationof 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1). By letter dated July 16, 1987, Respondent's counsel requested a hearingon the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause. The matter was placedon the docket of Administrative Law Judge Francis L. Young and the hearingwas held in New Orleans, Louisiana on November 17, 1987. On March 25, 1988, the Administrative Law Judge issued his opinion andrecommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision.No exceptions were filed and on May 20, 1988, the Administrative Law Judgetransmitted the record in this proceeding to the Administrator. The Administratorhas considered this record in its entirety and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67,hereby issues his final order in this matter, based upon findings of factand conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. The Administrative Law Judge found that several individuals were obtainingprescriptions for Dilaudid from Respondent for no legitimate medical purpose.Between 1979 and 1982, one individual obtained ``hundreds and hundreds''of prescriptions for 20 dosage units of 4 mg. Dilaudid from Respondentin exchange for either sexual favors or money. This individual often paidRespondent $450.00 for a prescription of Dilaudid. Additionally, in orprior to 1985, another individual exchanged sexual favors or money withRespondent for prescriptions of Dilaudid. On several occasions, this individualwent to see Respondent with her husband and they each paid $400.00 fora prescription for 20 Dilaudid 4 mg. tablets. None of the prescriptionswere issued for a legitimate medical purpose. Further, the Administrative Law Judge found that in or about 1984 or 1985,a commercial fisherman employed by Respondent received prescriptions forDilaudid from Respondent in lieu of salary for services rendered, not forany legitimate medical purpose. The Administrative Law Judge also found that an individual had purchasedover a hundred prescriptions for Dilaudid from Respondent as of September1985. Initially, the individual paid Respondent $350.00 for a prescriptionof 20 dilaudid 4 mg. tablets. Respondent subsequently increased the priceto $400.00 when the street value of Dilaudid went up. This individual metRespondent at his office or on the Interstate 55 service road. During oneof their meetings on the service road, Respondent showed the individuala handgun and told him if he ever told anyone about their arrangement thathe would have him shot. The individual began to cooperate with the Louisiana Department of PublicSafety in the Fall 1985. While working with the state police, he purchasedprescriptions for Dilaudid and V-Cillin from from Respondent on October15, 1985, November 14, 1985, and December 5, 1985. None of the prescriptionshad been written for a legitimate medical purpose. As a result, Respondentwas indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern Districtof Louisiana and charged with three counts of illegal distribution of Dilaudidin violation of 21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1). On January 28, 1987, Respondent entereda plea of <T3>nolo contendere. </T3>He was sentenced to three years imprisonment,execution of which ws suspended, was placed on active probation for threeyears and fined $150.00. Additionally, as a special condition of probation,Respondent was ordered by the Court not to issue prescriptions for ScheduleII narcotic drugs in the course of his dental practice. On December 5, 1987, a committee of the Louisiana State Board of dentistryheld an administrative hearing. The committee found that Respondent engagedin conduct giving cause for the suspension, revocation, or restrictingof his dental license. In a Proposed Final Decision, the committee recommendedthat Respondent's license to practice dentistry should be suspended fora period of two years and his dental license should be permanently restrictedto prohibit him from engaging in the administration, dispensation or prescriptionof any narcotic drug. Additionally, it proposed that after the expirationof his two year suspension, Respondent should be put on a ten year probationaryperiod. The committee also proposed that a fine of $3000.00 be imposedand that Respondent reimburse the Board $8,550.99 for expenses incurredby the proceedings. The Administrative Law Judge concluded that there is a lawful basis forrevocation of Respondent's DEA registration and recommended that Respondent'sDEA registration be revoked. The Administrator adopts the recommended ruling,findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision of the AdministrativeLaw Judge in their entirety. Respondent has been convicted of felony offensesrelating to controlled substances. There is, therefore, a lawful or statutorybasis for the revocation of his DEA registration and for the denial ofhis application for renewal thereof. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(2). In light of allof the facts and circumstances in this case, the Administrator concludesthat the registration must be revoked and his pending application denied.Accordingly, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration,pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration AA7218488,previously issued to Melvin Darryl Allen, D.D.S., be, and it hereby is,revoked.
