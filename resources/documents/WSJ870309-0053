You are told that much of U.S. industry is performing sluggishly because Americans don't want to work anymore or have forgotten how; that foreign rivals are competing unfairly through government machinations, ridiculously low wages or both; that the U.S. just hasn't surmounted the legacy of an overvalued dollar.    But all this emphasis on what is going wrong in the U.S. and in its relations with trading partners -- especially Japan, with its mercantilist drive to export -- tends to obscure a world-wide problem: Many major industries, all around the globe, are burdened with far too much capacity.    &quot;Overcapacity is a world-wide problem, and it's getting worse,&quot; says Lester Thurow, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;We're still investing as if the world economy were growing at 4% a year instead of the actual rate of about 2%.&quot;    While a lot of automated capacity has been added, effective demand has been sluggish. Knocking many buyers out of the market have been the debt burdens in Latin America, the political and economic slide of much of Africa, and the torpor of most Communist economies.    Even then, the forces of supply and demand should, theoretically, produce prices that clear the markets. But they seem not to be doing so, or are working only slowly and painfully, partly because of protectionism, government subsidies and other forms of political interference with the process of economic adjustment. In many industries, moreover, declining prices have rendered some high-cost facilities uneconomic.    Not everyone is rattled by the overcapacity, however. Marvin Runyon, a former Ford executive who runs Nissan's plant in Smyrna, Tenn., says: &quot;You read that we're putting too much capacity in place, but that's the way it has to be in a competitive industry. I say hooray for the American consumer, because somebody is going to have to do things better than somebody else. The consumer will benefit.&quot;    Whether good or bad, overcapacity is obvious in many industries. Among them:    Autos. Roger Vincent, an expert at Bankers Trust Co., estimates that world automotive demand stands in the &quot;low 30 millions&quot; of vehicles annually, while capacity &quot;is in the low to mid-40s.&quot; By 1990, capacity should rise to the mid-40s, he says, and demand won't grow very much. Thus, world overcapacity could expand to about 15 million units from about 10 million currently, he believes.    Steel. Estimates vary, but most economists calculate the annual global overcapacity at 75 million to 200 million metric tons -- compared with total capacity of 570 million tons in non-Communist countries and 455 million tons in industrialized nations. John Jacobson, an economist at Chase Econometrics, figures that only if the entire U.S. steel industry shut down would demand equal supply in the non-Communist world.    Computers. Although no figures on the industry's capacity use are published, most computer makers are clearly being plagued with overcapacity. The problem is reflected in declining orders and intense competition.    Semiconductors. In the U.S. and Japan, which together account for 87% of global chip making, the equipment-use rate -- the best measure of overcapacity -- skidded from nearly 100% in 1984 to about 60% in 1985. However, Dataquest Inc., a market-research firm, says it is now back up to roughly 70% and rising.    Heavy Equipment. Makers of farm and construction equipment are buried in overcapacity, but, surprisingly, some countries, especially South Korea, are nonetheless believed to be planning more plants.    Textiles. In the textile industry, cheap-labor foreign competition is causing the howls. Overcapacity lingers on as more and more mills are built in less developed nations, with more and more mills in the U.S. thus turned into surplus capacity.    However, some once-glutted industries have got supply and demand back into balance. For example, much of the chemical and plastics group has cut capacity and expanded sales, and the glut of a few years ago has been largely cured.    Looking at many troubled industries, Joseph L. Bower, a Harvard Business School professor, attributes much of the excess capacity to &quot;country after country building world-scale facilities.&quot; Newly industrializing countries have ample reason for fostering development, of course. They want to create industrial jobs at a time of rapidly expanding populations, of an influx into the cities and of rising educational levels, which create labor forces sufficiently skilled for factory work. The weakness in many commodity markets also encourages the idea that any hope for economic growth lies in industry.    Industrialization has been rapid, Mr. Bower adds, &quot;because technology and capital are now highly mobile -- it's staggering how fast they can move around the world nowadays.&quot; No longer, he says, is the game played by &quot;just four or five good players.&quot; He urges that American companies &quot;understand that we've moved from Ivy League football to the Big Ten.&quot;    Many economists trace the overcapacity back to the booming early 1970s, when many manufacturers saw tremendous growth in demand ahead and expanded accordingly. Other analysts go back much further. Jay W. Forrester, also of MIT, traces the problem -- which he thinks will get worse -- largely to &quot;the big buildup of capacity during and after World War II.&quot; He recalls that &quot;the idea took hold that more capital plant was invariably desirable,&quot; and building it was facilitated by &quot;the enormous forced savings that had accumulated during the war years.&quot;    Also greasing the path to industrial overcapacity are plentiful supplies and low prices of many raw materials -- an incentive for marginal manufacturers to keep producing and for newcomers to enter the game. The gluts affect a wide range of commodities. For example, producers of nickel and molybdenum, both used in producing steel, are operating at roughly 70% to 75% of capacity world-wide, estimates Robin Adams, the president of Resource Strategies Inc., a consulting firm in Exton, Pa. The copper industry is operating at a little over 80% of capacity, he adds.    The stage for the commodity gluts was set in the inflationary 1970s, when price shocks stimulated investment in production capacity in many commodities. But in many cases, demand hasn't grown to meet the increased production.    Moreover, many debt-laden countries increased the output of commodities to avoid spending precious foreign exchange on imports. Others invested in commodity-producing capacity to generate export cash regardless of price. Many countries &quot;only had one option, and that was to produce more. So we didn't follow the normal corrective path,&quot; says Donald Ratajczak, the head forecaster at Georgia State University. Copper, for example, has responded slowly to reduced demand.    Oil is abundant, too. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing less than 15.8 million barrels of oil a day, compared with capacity of nearly 30 million. However, the surplus is mainly in crude oil -- both in the ground, in production capacity, and above it, in inventories. In petroleum refining, much of the overcapacity has been trimmed back. U.S. refineries are operating at about 80% of capacity, a relatively high level, and as gasoline demand rises, processing facilities may be approaching their effective limits.    But the oil-service sector remains awash in red ink. After the collapse in petroleum prices last year, oil companies slashed exploration and production spending by 40% to 50%. This year, spending remains depressed. Thus, only 25% of the U.S. drilling-rig fleet is active, and manufacturers of oil-field equipment have several times the capacity currently needed.    Here is a detailed look at the overcapacity problems in major industries.    Autos   Automotive experts agree that the industry suffers from vast overcapacity world-wide and that Japan, like North America and Europe, will soon be hit as it builds more U.S. plants. But they disagree about the extent of the overcapacity; some measure cars, for example, and others measure all vehicles.    Ford, which gauges capacity quite differently from Bankers Trust, estimates 1985 world-wide overcapacity at 3.8 million cars and trucks, and it believes that by 1990, world-wide excess capacity will rise to six million units, 5.7 million of which will be aimed at North America.    The principal force behind the projected increase is the expansion of Japanese auto manufacturing. The Japanese, having pushed aggressively into the U.S. auto market, are reacting to the voluntary export restraints and the threat of more American protectionism. &quot;The building of Japanese plants in the U.S. wasn't motivated by economics,&quot; Bankers Trust's Mr. Vincent says. &quot;It was motivated by concern over future protectionism.&quot;    As a result, the auto glut bedeviling the U.S. industry is being worsened. Starting in 1989, Daihatsu Motor will be producing cars in Canada, thus becoming the last of Japan's nine auto makers to put an assembly plant in North America.    Meanwhile, other players keep getting into the game. In the wake of the success of South Korea's Hyundai Excel, Kia Motors of Korea is planning to export cars and vans world-wide by the end of this decade. Yugoslavia is exporting its Yugos to the U.S., and Malaysia plans to send its Proton Sagas here next year. Thailand and Taiwan also are trying to export.    &quot;Newly industrialized countries all want auto companies so they can have steel industries and reasons to build roads and purchase technology from the outside world,&quot; says Susan Jacobs, the manager of automotive research at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.    However, she also attributes the excess capacity to sluggish world-wide demand. In addition, she says, new plants were built to make the small cars that became popular during the energy crisis of the 1970s and to enter new market niches, such as that for light trucks.    Japan hasn't had more automobile start-up companies than Europe or the U.S., Mr. Vincent says. &quot;It's just that they all managed to survive&quot; -- with government help. Other nations have done much the same, however. The U.S. government saved Chrysler. And Donald Petersen, Ford's chairman, notes the heavy French subsidies for Renault and American Motors and says he expects the two French producers, Renault and Peugeot, to survive &quot;as long as there is a France.&quot;    Japan and South Korea also have stimulated their auto industries by closing their home markets to outsiders and encouraging exports. Moreover, the Japanese also have helped South Korea develop its auto industry. Mr. Vincent believes that the Japanese are saying, &quot;It's inevitable, and why not be part of it?&quot;    Mr. Vincent notes that in the past, American auto companies, looking forward to the next auto-buying boom, often created excess capacity. If the market grew, &quot;you are bailed out by higher demand; otherwise, you get stuck with overcapacity -- which is what has happened to some companies,&quot; he says.    But the patterns have shifted. Ford reacted to flatter demand by changing its philosophy -- keeping capacity tight, forgoing some sales but betting that lower capacity would cut costs and keep it profitable when demand fell. But until recently, General Motors kept more capacity running than its sales warranted. Now, however, GM also is closing more plants.    James P. Womack, the research director of the international motor-vehicle program at MIT, believes that apparent world overcapacity might not be as large as it seems because &quot;some plants are dedicated {to a certain type of vehicle} and can't be switched from product to product.&quot; While the Japanese have built flexible plants that can make more than one vehicle, he says, &quot;the North American philosophy has been not to complicate matters by mixing products&quot; -- a policy that aggravates the overcapacity.    Steel   The global glut of steel reflects poor investment decisions in the 1970s, dwindling use of steel in industrialized economies, burgeoning production in industrializing countries, and high financial and political barriers to closing mills.    Anticipating shortages, steelmakers in Europe and Japan greatly expanded capacity in the 1970s, and U.S. producers modernized existing mills. Not only did scarcity never come, but consumption fell sharply in industrialized countries. Between 1970 and 1980, according to the World Bank and International Iron and Steel Institute, capacity in industrialized nations climbed 14% to 485 million metric tons, while consumption dropped 8% to 334 million metric tons.    Yet despite mounting evidence of a &quot;phony boom,&quot; steel executives &quot;just wouldn't give up the illusion that the market was headed up,&quot; says Hans Mueller, a steel-industry consultant.    Plunging consumption in industrialized nations, which is expected to continue into the 1990s, reflects the maturation of their economies. Construction of railroads and highways has largely been completed. And in other big steel markets -- autos and containers, for example -- alternative materials are increasingly supplanting steel. Donald F. Barnett, a World Bank consultant, calculates that had U.S. steel usage since 1960 matched the growth in gross national product, steel consumption in 1985 would have been some 70% higher.    Faced with excess capacity, European and Japanese steelmakers, in particular, have turned to export markets. But there they are increasingly finding limits. U.S. producers have won import curbs, and less developed countries, though consuming more and more steel, are producing much of it themselves.    Some, moreover, are becoming major exporters, penetrating traditional European and Japanese export markets. In 1976, Brazil, for instance, produced 7.3 million metric tons of steel products and exported a mere 264,000 tons. Today, it is the world's fifth-largest non-Communist steelmaker, and it exported 40% of the 17.3 million tons it produced in 1985.    Rapid growth in steelmaking capacity may have as much to do with nationalism and industrial prestige as economic growth. Today, Zimbabwe and Qatar have steel industries. &quot;Every industrializing country wants an airline and a steel mill,&quot; Chase's Mr. Jacobson says. &quot;It's something that planning ministers push for.&quot;    Capacity has fallen modestly among industrialized nations since 1980, and the reductions are continuing. In the U.S., steelmaking capacity (including recently announced cutbacks) is being slashed to 111.9 million short tons from its 1977 peak of 160 million tons. Even with the cutbacks that have been carried out, the U.S. industry is operating at only 55% of capacity, Georgia State's Mr. Ratajczak estimates.    In Japan, all five major steelmakers are cutting production capacity, although only one, Nippon Steel, has specified its plan in terms of crude steel-production capacity; it is cutting back to 24 million metric tons annually from 34 million tons.    Louis L. Schorsch, a consultant at McKinsey andamp; Co., expects future mill closings to be much more difficult. In the U.S., many steelmakers, saddled with huge unfunded pension liabilities, are reluctant to shut even unprofitable plants because they can't absorb the cost of paying off workers and other expenses. Chase Econometrics estimates the total cost of closing a mill at $75,000 per employee. &quot;Given an average of 4,000 employees per plant,&quot; Mr. Jacobson says, &quot;we estimate that a typical integrated-plant closure today would cost over $300 million.&quot;    Mr. Barnett adds: &quot;So far, steelmakers have closed mostly old plants that hadn't been in operation anyway. Now, they've got to get rid of relatively modern capacity that can still make a satisfactory product. The hard part is just beginning.&quot;    Computers   Seduced by huge sales gains during the 1983-84 boom, computer companies expanded rapidly. Most &quot;invested in growth rates that aren't materializing,&quot; says Ulric Weil, a Washington-based securities analyst. &quot;Demand just didn't develop.&quot; According to Commerce Department figures, factory orders for the office-equipment and computer industry plunged 15% in the twoyear period ended in 1986.    A good barometer is International Business Machines, which accounts for 40% of the world's computer sales. Last year, IBM's revenue rose only 2% to $51.25 billion, and profit slumped. This isn't the type of growth IBM anticipated. In the past five years, IBM spent more than $20 billion on plant and equipment, says Steven Milunovich, a First Boston analyst.    IBM responded to last year's disappointments by consolidating operations at several U.S. locations &quot;to bring capacity in line with current and projected needs,&quot; IBM Chairman John Akers said in the company's 1986 annual report.    Nevertheless, many computer makers expanded in the fight for sales. &quot;People who participated in niches in the past want to expand and provide complete systems for their customers,&quot; says David Penning, the director of manufacturing-automation service at Dataquest. For instance, he adds, some personal-computer companies now make work stations, while some computer makers best known for mainframes make personal computers.    Technological advances have aggravated the overcapacity. With more power being stored on silicon chips, computer companies can make smaller, more powerful machines. &quot;Any given square footage of plant can produce a lot more stuff in terms of horsepower,&quot; Mr. Weil says. The minicomputer market is being squeezed from two sides: on the lower end, by more powerful personal computers, and on the upper end, by lower prices on computers with the power once associated with mainframes.    The emergence of manufacturers in the Far East, especially those in Japan and South Korea, has compounded the overcapacity problem for U.S. computer makers. Last year, the U.S. computer and parts trade deficit with Far Eastern countries soared 77% to $5.3 billion, according to the Commerce Department. Japan's exports to the U.S., ranging from parts to portable personal computers to supercomputers, surged 43% to $4.75 billion last year.    Moreover, countries that had primarily produced peripherals are exporting full machines now, says Tim Miles, a program manager in the department's Office of Computers. &quot;The South Koreans began penetrating the U.S. market in terminals and other areas,&quot; Mr. Miles says. &quot;Now, they're producing complete PC systems.&quot;    Not all computer makers have been suffering, however. Some companies, such as Tandy Corp., which makes personal computers, and Digital Equipment Corp., a minicomputer maker, have grown rapidly, primarily because of revamped product lines. Moreover, the pressure on the industry would be reduced by any pickup in sales. Already, there are signs of rebounding volume in personal computers.    Semiconductors   The glut in the semiconductor industry eased last year, as orders picked up from a disastrous 1985, but most chip makers remain deeply troubled. The roots of the problems are twofold: Huge miscalculations of future demand and Japanese producers' targeting practices, under which they ignored market conditions while aggressively pursuing market share.    The introduction of the personal computer early this decade spawned a sudden surge in demand for chips. Global chip consumption jumped from about $15 billion in 1982 to $29 billion in 1984. Thus, chip makers rushed to add capacity to meet growing, apparently insatiable demand. Japanese chip makers' capital spending rose a total of 116% in 1983 and 1984, while U.S. chip-company spending doubled in 1984. World-wide capacity to produce chips increased about one-third in 1984 alone.    Then, when falling personal-computer sales sent global chip demand plummeting about 14%, to $25 billion, in 1985, chip companies started losing big money. Dataquest says the chip industries in Japan and the U.S. each lost about $1 billion last year.    Moreover, Japanese producers exacerbated the industry's overcapacity problems by continuing to add production and slash prices on certain products right through the slump. Taking advantage of their lower-cost capital, patient stockholders and government research assistance, the Japanese drove U.S. producers out of some major commodity markets by drastically underselling them.    Indeed, the U.S. government found that Japanese companies &quot;dumped&quot; certain chips in the U.S. and other markets, and the U.S. may soon penalize them if they don't raise their prices. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, trying to save a semiconductor trade pact signed last summer, has told Japanese chip makers to cut production 10%.    Heavy Equipment   Plunging demand has blighted the farm-equipment industry with huge world-wide overcapacity. The glut has persisted despite sharp cutbacks in the number of factories producing tractors, combines and other agricultural equipment.    Sales have consistently trailed even the most pessimistic forecasts. In retrospect, that isn't surprising. The world is awash in food. A few years ago, fears of shortages, embargoes and price gouging led many food-importing countries, such as Japan, to give agriculture a high priority. Many nations imported new agricultural technology that now has borne fruit.    The global surplus of food and feed grains is expected to surge to a 13-week supply this year; an eight-week supply would be ample. The U.S. has more than a one-year supply of wheat, enough for both exports and domestic consumption.    With farmers in dire financial trouble, the business of supplying them with new equipment is as dead as last year's cornfield. World-wide tractor output fell to 120,000 units last year from 230,000 in 1979. For larger equipment, the declines have been even sharper. Manufacturers produced 20,000 over-100-horsepower tractors last year, down from 80,000 in 1979.    &quot;The downturn has been so dramatic that no one has done anything but cut back,&quot; says John Ruth, Massey-Ferguson's president. He says he doesn't know of any additions to industry capacity anywhere in the past five years. Because of high costs, some U.S. facilities were among the first to close, with part of their production moving to existing foreign plants.    Mr. Ruth sees further cutbacks in capacity needed for anyone to make a profit. But for now, companies are playing an industrywide game of chicken. No one wants to get out of the business so that rivals can make money again.    In construction equipment, too, demand is down, but, surprisingly, capacity is still rising.    In the late 1970s, construction-equipment sales surged, and plants were operating at close to capacity even though Japan was working hard to build a construction-equipment industry. But from 1980 to 1983, demand plunged 70%, beaten down by reduced demand for coal as well as a decline in world-wide construction activity. Construction was hurt in part by declining oil profits and international-debt problems.    Now, demand has recovered a bit, but the industry is still running only at about 60% of capacity. Nevertheless, some countries are planning to expand even more. Industry analysts expect South Korea soon to begin an assault on the market. &quot;Korea is a big emerging threat,&quot; says Frank Manfredi, the publisher of Machinery Outlook, an industry newsletter. &quot;Everyone is expecting them to come into the market like gangbusters.&quot; Other countries that have added capacity in construction equipment are China and Italy.    &quot;It's ironic that even though sales have been lousy, there's more capacity in the industry than there was five years ago,&quot; says Mitchell Quainn, a securities analyst at Wertheim Shroder andamp; Co. &quot;It's almost as if every country wants to have its own bulldozer manufacturer.&quot;    Textiles   Seeking crucial foreign exchange and jobs for surging populations, many developing nations are producing textiles and apparel at rates far above domestic demand. Building a textile industry &quot;is the first thing that a developing nation does&quot; as it moves toward industrialization, says Ron Levine, a Commerce Department official. He notes the abundance of raw materials and such countries' cheap labor.    Cheap labor is at the heart of the overcapacity problem cited by the U.S. industry. For six years, foreign producers have flooded the American market with goods, principally apparel fabrics and finished garments, and forced the domestic industry to shrink dramatically to survive.    Arriving in the U.S. last year were some 12.7 billion square yards of imports, 17% more than in 1985 and more than double the 1980 level. &quot;Imports have achieved a successively increasing share of the {U.S.} market,&quot; says Donald R. Hughes, the chief financial officer at Burlington Industries, the nation's largest publicly held textile concern. In six years, imports have taken 55% of the total market, up from about 25% in 1980, he says.    &quot;Historically, the level of increase in {U.S.} demand has been about 1% annually. Yet imports have been growing at a rate of 15%,&quot; he adds.    Domestic textile leaders blame the Reagan administration's trade policies for the surge in imports. And the drop in the dollar hasn't slowed the imports because most of them come from Asian nations with currencies pegged to the dollar.    The glut of imports has forced the domestic industry to reassess its basic structure and make sweeping changes. Domestic companies have closed dozens of plants -- at a cost of about 700,000 jobs -- and installed high-tech equipment designed to make mills more efficient and versatile. They also are emphasizing marketing and customer services, and some analysts see domestic retailers and garment makers gradually shifting back to buying from U.S. sources because of improved quality and quicker deliveries.    Chemicals   Chemical companies have scrapped scores of plants in recent years, spurring a long-awaited growth in plant-capacity use. Last year, chemical-plant use rates rose to an estimated 80.5% from 66% five years ago, according to the Chemical Manufacturers Association. The trade group expects plant use to reach 82.3% this year, Myron Foveaux, a spokesman, says.    The wave of plant closures reflects retrenchment from the industry's building boom in the mid-1970s. The recessions of the early 1980s convinced many chemical producers that the industry was awash in capacity, says Sano Shimoda, an analyst at Anantha Raman andamp; Co., of Parsippany, N.J. Total U.S. chemical-plant capacity fell 3% between 1984 and 1986, he estimates.    The retrenchments were especially successful in plastics. During the 1960s and 1970s, plastics appeared to be one of the most promising growth industries. Plastics were replacing glass, paper, metals and other materials in applications ranging from plumbing to auto parts. Chemical manufacturers, oil and gas producers, and tire makers built plastics plants. Few old facilities were shut down.    Demand did grow, but not as fast as forecast. By 1980, there was overcapacity for many plastics, and prices plunged. Some companies pulled out of the business, and most others halted plant construction. In both Europe and North America, some old plants were closed. Gradually, the cutbacks and rising consumption brought supply and demand for some common resins in better balance.    Polyvinyl chloride illustrates the trend. U.S. capacity more than doubled between 1965 and 1974, dipped briefly during the 1973-75 recession and then doubled again. By the end of 1983, U.S. capacity was about 8.5 billion pounds a year, up from two billion in 1965. But although PVC has grown rapidly in pipe, siding and other construction applications, no major plant has been built since 1983, and U.S. PVC plants are running at close to 90% of capacity. In Europe, there still is some overcapacity, but some plant closings are planned. Worldwide capacity is likely to be tight for five years or so, according to Richard Roman, the manager of marketing research for the Geon Vinyl division of B.F. Goodrich.    Among the large-volume resins, polystyrene, used for many inexpensive molded products, now is in the tightest supply. Dow Chemical, a major producer, is running its polystyrene plants at about 94% of capacity, &quot;right at the ragged edge of what we can do,&quot; a spokesman says.    In contrast, the fertilizer industry, suffering along with the farmers, is still in trouble. Between 1984 and 1986, capacity reductions reached 7%, but plant-use rates are still only 74%, Mr. Shimoda says.    By spurring demand for chemicals, lower oil prices have helped U.S. chemical producers increase plant use, Mr. Foveaux says. Cheaper oil, along with chemical producers' sweeping cutbacks in personnel and productivity gains stemming from development of improved chemical catalysts, has enabled the companies to reduce plant break-even points to 70% from 75% five years ago, Mr. Foveaux says. &quot;It's still not ringing bells, but, as a whole, the industry is much better off,&quot; he adds.    Although some small specialty chemical plants are likely to be built soon, both Messrs. Foveaux and Shimoda expect U.S. basic-chemical production to shrink further. &quot;Profitability is improving, but people are still very hesitant to build,&quot; Mr. Shimoda says.    The Outlook   In view of the problems, what is the outlook for American companies struggling in industries with global overcapacity?    Noting that &quot;manufacturers have sharply reduced operating costs and restructured their industries,&quot; Alan Greenspan, a New York consultant, says, &quot;We still have problems because the real cost of capital is too high. That slows the replacement of obsolete capacity.&quot; He adds:    &quot;Funds are diverted away from research, away from long-term projects. The emphasis is on high-tech investments that pay off fast -- and become obsolete quickly. There's no incentive for the sort of investments that would bring back the Rust Belt. Economic policy really does matter.&quot;    Saying that &quot;a variety of industries still have huge readjustment problems . . . associated with the excess capacity,&quot; Karl Brunner of the University of Rochester adds:    &quot;If we want to be competitive in the world, we have to stand back and let the adjustments take place. We can't protect these industries from change, any more than we protected the Pony Express riders of a century ago. We have to improve our use of resources and our productivity.    &quot;Sure, it would help if we could distribute more products overseas to people who need them. But we aren't going to solve the U.S. auto industry's problems by selling more cars to Africa in the next decade. We have to begin with adjustments here at home. We have to mitigate the hardships for the people caught in these adjustments, but we can't let that stand in the way of the adjustments being made.&quot;    ---                      Japanese Auto Makers   A comprehensive listing of Japanese companies that buildcars in North America or are planning production:    Company                     Year: Total Capacity    Honda of American    Marysville, Ohio            1986: 220,000    Nissan Motor Mfg.
