Jesse Jackson plans to be the host of aweekly, one-hour television program scheduled to begin next fallthat will give a platform to ``those whose voices have been lockedout.''   Plans for the syndicated program, ``Voices of America with JesseJackson,'' were announced Thursday at a news conference by Jacksonand Dick Robertson, president of Warner Bros. TelevisionDistribution, which will market the show.   Jackson said his goal on the show will be to ``create access,precipitate ideas and be fair.''   ``It's not so much the national conclusions that we seek as weseek the national debate, to open up the great and critical issuesof our day,'' said the civil rights leader and former presidentialcandidate.   Jackson said he wanted to break the narrowness of currenttelevision in which ``fewer and fewer people talk about more andmore and often know less and less.''   He suggested that along with powerful political voices fromabroad, he also would offer access to such people as striking coalminers, or to family farmers and the rural bankers who mustforeclose on them, or teachers who face a coming generation ofcrack-addicted children.   Neither a format nor a home base for the program has been workedout, nor has Warner begun lining up stations, said Robertson.   Van Gordon Sauter, former president of CBS News, and QuincyJones, the musician and recording executive, will be executiveproducers of the program.   Sauter said it is likely that the show will combine elements ofthe talk, magazine and interview formats.   ``I think given the uniqueness of the talent (Jackson), thebreadth of his curiosities, of his knowledge of people and hiscontacts, it is not a broadcast that is going to easily fit intowhat are the normal categories,'' said Sauter.   Jackson declined to disclose what he would earn from the show.``We're into private enterprise now, you know. We'll let you knowat the appropriate time,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
