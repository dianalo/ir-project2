Mr. White said he believes a tentative contract with Ford Canada can be reached before the union's strike deadline at 10 a.m. EDT tomorrow.    Donald McKenzie, Ford Canada's chief negotiator, said after presenting the offer that some local and noneconomic issues remain unresolved. But he said the company believes its initial offer &quot;should be the basis for a settlement&quot; with the union, which represents 13,000 workers at the unit of Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford Motor Co. Mr. McKenzie declined to provide details of the offer.    Mr. White said the offer appeared to be &quot;a carbon copy&quot; of the pattern-setting agreement reached earlier this month between the union and Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian unit.    As previously reported, the Chrysler pact includes a pension plan to be renegotiated in six years that provides cost-of-living adjustments for future retirees, the union's main demand. The Chrysler contract also contains annual increases on current pensions ranging from an average of 4.5% to 9%, and annual wage increases of 3%, 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively in each year of the accord.    The union said it scheduled membership meetings this weekend in which Ford Canada workers could vote on a new pact if one is reached by then.    Despite the optimism of Mr. McKenzie and Mr. White, both said some local and noneconomic issues remain to be settled before the deadline, which Mr. White said he wouldn't extend. He said a proposal to reduce the number of job classifications was among those the union found unacceptable.    Mr. White said the union also is opposed to a company proposal made yesterday to form a labor-management committee that would examine &quot;work groups and a whole range&quot; of other local issues. Mr. White said the proposal would &quot;play one plant against the other.&quot;    Mr. White said he also planned to press for a &quot;satisfactory explanation&quot; of the possible impact in Canada of the job security pact reached between Ford and U.S. workers. &quot;If we don't get it, there won't be a settlement,&quot; he said. Some United Auto Workers union officials have said the U.S. pact could make Ford jobs in Canada less secure.    As previously reported, Ford's tentative U.S. pact would require the company to pay U.S. workers who lose their jobs when work is shifted to non-UAW plants, including those represented by the Canadian union. Mr. White said he is concerned about the view held by some U.S. union officials that the U.S. pact would induce Ford to sacrifice Canadian jobs first in an industry downturn.    The Canadian union is mainly worried about the proposed U.S. pact's possible effect on jobs at Ford Canada's Oakville, Ontario, car assembly plant. Ford Canada has previously hinted that the plant, one of two in North America that makes Tempo and Topaz compact cars, could face job losses if sales decline.    Once Ford Canada's workers accept a new pact, the union will turn its attention to General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit, where it will try to win similar terms. The union's previous contracts with both companies expired Sept. 14. </TEXT></DOC>
