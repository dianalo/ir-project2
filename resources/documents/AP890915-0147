(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The crew of space shuttle Atlantisconcluded a two-day countdown rehearsal Friday and traveled toWashington for a meeting with Vice President Dan Quayle.   The practice session, intended to mimic the 24 hours leading toan actual launch, went smoothly despite two computer glitches thatdelayed the end of the countdown, NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said.   Soon after wrapping up the rehearsal, the five astronauts boardedtheir T-38 jets for a flight to Washington. White House officialssaid Quayle planned to meet commander Don Williams and his crewmatesSaturday at breakfast. Williams comes from Quayle's home state ofIndiana.   ``Mr. Quayle expressed a desire to say hello to the crew sometimebefore we fly,'' Williams told reporters Thursday. ``I invited himto be a launch guest, but we'll be pretty busy and won't be able tovisit with him on launch morning.''   The rehearsal ended at 11:10 a.m. EDT, about 10 minutes laterthan planned, because launch crews needed extra time to investigatetwo problems in computers monitoring the shuttle's systems.   The astronauts and their support crews carried the dressrehearsal to its finish, even though stormy weather near the KennedySpace Center would have prevented an actual liftoff.   Atlantis' liftoff is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 12. TheNational Aeronautics and Space Administration will not set a firmdate until a two-day flight readiness review is completed Oct. 3.   The astronauts were aboard Atlantis for the final two hours ofthe countdown during the dry run. In addition to Williams, the crewmembers are pilot Mike McCully and mission specialists Ellen Baker,Franklin Chang Diaz and Shannon Lucid.   During the first day of the five-day flight, the astronauts areto dispatch the nuclear-powered Galileo spacecraft on the start of asix-year voyage to explore Jupiter and its moons.   Anti-nuclear activists have said they will try to block thelaunch, either by court action or by trespassing at the launch site,because the probe is powered by two generators fueled byplutonium-238. They are afraid an accident during launch wouldsprinkle hazardous radioactive fallout on communities surroundingthe Kennedy Space Center.   Similar nuclear generators have provided electrical power on 22previous U.S. space flights, including the six manned Apollo moonmissions and the Voyager 2 probe, which recently sent back picturesof the planet Neptune.   The five astronauts on the mission say they are confident thenuclear generators are safe.</TEXT></DOC>
