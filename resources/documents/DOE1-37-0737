<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-37-0737 </DOCNO><TEXT>Experiments on the transferability of fracture mechanics data to thickwalled tubes have been performed with the materials X10NiCrAlTi 32 20(Alloy 800 H) and NiCr 22 Co 12 Mo (Inconel 617). The fatigue crack growthis well described by the linear elastic concept up to the highest testingtemperatures (900degC). For the description of the creep crack propagationin tubes the parameter 'energy rate integral' seems to be suitable.</TEXT></DOC>
