A state superior court in Sacramento declared the state's controversial unitary tax unconstitutional as applied to foreign-based multinational corporations. The decision by Judge George Paras came in the case of Barclays Bank International, challenging the law that bases a company's state tax assessment on its world-wide revenue, rather than the portion of its business conducted in California.    In an interview, Judge Paras, who retired after the decision last week, explained that &quot;the prime thrust of the decision was that it (the tax) violates the foreign commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.&quot; He said that clause grants to Congress the power to regulate commerce with other nations, and the California unitary tax is inconsistent with that provision.    &quot;We're delighted,&quot; said Joanne Garvey, the San Francisco attorney who represented Barclays in the case. She said Barclays has 220 subsidiaries, only three of which do business in California. The British-based company said in its suit that for 1977 it was assessed more than $250,000 beyond what it felt was fair.    The State Franchise Tax Board will appeal the decision, said Robert Milam, the state deputy attorney general who argued the case for California.    The decision is set to take effect July 17, but neither party believes the controversy is over.    &quot;The State Franchise Tax Board will take it all the way and so will our client,&quot; Ms. Garvey said. &quot;It's quite possible that this will end up in the U.S. Supreme Court,&quot; she added, because of the case's precedent-setting value.    Huge sums may be involved. Silicon Valley companies irked by Japanese competition in the computer industry have argued for years that the loss of unitary taxing could cost the state $250 million a year -- an amount Ms. Garvey said is &quot;grossly exaggerated.&quot;    Mr. Milam said he was familiar with the $250 million estimate, but said he was uncertain of the real amount at stake.    Barclays, one of Britain's largest banks, brought the suit against the Franchise Tax Board in 1984, challenging its assessments under the unitary system that began in 1969. Barclays stands to retain or recoup $19 million if it ultimately prevails, according to David Elvidge, head of Barclay's central taxation department in London. He said the figure includes taxes it has paid and will seek returned and taxes that are owed but unpaid. </TEXT></DOC>
