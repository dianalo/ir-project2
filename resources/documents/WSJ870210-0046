It became the fifth large Canadian concern in the past year to announce plans to sell holdings in South Africa, where racial policies have prompted many companies to shed interests there.    Falconbridge, a big nickel and copper producer, said it received $65 million for its interest in Western Platinum, a producer of platinum, gold, and base metals that is 51%-owned by Britain's Lonrho PLC. A further $10 million is due Oct. 1, for a total sale price of $75 million. The buyer wasn't identified.    William James, Falconbridge's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said proceeds will be used to reduce long-term debt or increase the company's cash surplus. Falconbridge had long-term debt of about $1.2 billion (Canadian) and cash on hand of $300 million (Canadian) prior to the transaction, he said.    Western Platinum is the fifth company in which Falconbridge has sold its interest since the beginning of 1986, raising total proceeds of about $324 million (Canadian). Much of it has been used to reduce debt acquired when Falconbridge bought Kidd Creek Mines Ltd. last year for $615 million (Canadian).    Mr. James announced plans to sell Falconbridge's stake in Western Platinum last August. Though Mr. James said the decision was taken, in part, because of the political climate in South Africa, he emphasized that the primary reason for the sale was to improve its financial condition.    Church-related groups have long pressed Canadian companies to sell their South African interests because of that country's racial policies. </TEXT></DOC>
