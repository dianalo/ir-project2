But AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini toppled a king, stunned a superpower and shookthe world with his message of Moslem piety and might.   Tehran radio reported early Sunday that Khomeini died in ahospital in the Iranian capital, 12 days after undergoing surgeryfor intenstinal bleeding. He was 86.   Through years of war and internal turmoil, the Iranian leader'smagnetism held his country's Islamic revolution together.   As the absolute ``guide'' of Iran's 10-year-old revolutionarygovernment, he condoned the seizure of 52 U.S. Embassy hostages inTehran, waged war on Iraq and blessed the executions of tens ofthousands of Iranians _ dissidents and sinners, prostitutes, drugdealers and users, adulterers and other violators of the Islamiccode.   ``God preserve Khomeini until the return of the 12th imam,''pleaded a banner in Tehran, referring to the promised messiah ofIran's Shiite Moslem religion, of whom Khomeini was held to berepresentative on Earth.   Khomeini's enemies predicted the Islamic revolutionarygovernment would die with him.   ``The regime's existing contradictions will lose their sole axisof unity .. and be raised to the explosive level,'' said oneanti-Khomeini group.   Khomeini and his followers labored to make Iran's unique brandof religious rule permanent.   ``We may have different viewpoints, but we must all keeptogether,'' Khomeini told the Iranian Cabinet in October 1985.   But in March 1989, Khomeini dumped the man chosen by the83-member Assembly of Experts as his successor in 1985, AyatollahHussein-Ali Montazeri, leaving the field open to rival candidatesor a collective leadership.   As the exiled voice of opposition to Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi,Khomeini spurred Iranians into months of street protests andstrikes that in February 1979 finally ended 2,500 years of monarchy.   In power, Khomeini looked beyond Iran's borders, full of zeal toconvert other lands to his brand of religious fundamentalism andmobilize Islam into a powerful world force.   ``We should ... awaken the people of the world if we want toexport the revolution,'' he declared in a speech in October 1981.   He was an unlikely leader, often ailing, quiet-spoken, appearinginfrequently in public. After a heart attack in February 1980, hemoved into a house in the northern Tehran suburb of Jamaran wheregroups of admirers often sat in a courtyard while he waved at themsilently from a balcony.   Last month, he underwent surgery for bleeding in his digestivetract. After the operation doctors pronounced him in good shape forhis age.   Until the end of the Iran-Iraq war, Khomeini spoke frequently onthe radio. After that his statements were read for him, often byhis politically ambitious son Ahmad.   He spoke of the need for unity and for becoming more Islamic,appealing to a deep chord among the Iranian masses. The Khomeiniface _ white beard, dark eyes glaring out from beneath bushy browsand black turban _ glowered from posters, billboards and bannersacross Iran.   The ascetic ayatollah extolled self-denial and the simple valuesof traditional Islamic life. He inveighed against theWesternization and corruption of the Pahlavi years and demandedthat women return to the old, head-to-foot chador veil.   He railed against the ``world-devouring'' governments _ theUnited States and Soviet Union _ that sought influence over Iran.   The ayatollah ``is of the opinion that Islam is a religionembracing all aspects of human life,'' an official Iranianbiography said of him.   The drive to create a purely Islamic state fired the imaginationof fundamentalists throughout the Moslem world, especially amongShiites, often an impoverished minority in Moslem nations.   This worried Iran's Arab neighbors, many ruled byWestern-aligned monarchs or radical secular autocrats and dominatedby the less stern Sunni Moslem sect.   Fear of ``Khomeinist'' efforts at subversion was one reasonIraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in September 1980.   The outside world knew little of Khomeini until the uprisingagainst the shah in 1978. But for Iranians he had been a symbol ofthe anti-Pahlavi movement for decades.   According to his brother, he was born Sept. 23, 1902, in thevillage of Khomein, 140 miles southwest of Tehran. He was the sonof the local religious leader, Ayatollah Sayed Mustafa Musavi.   The official biography says his mother was the daughter ofanother ayatollah, the highest Shiite Moslem religious title,meaning ``verses of Allah.''   His father was killed at age 42 by ``some wicked men,'' thebiography says, and from the age of 5 months, Khomeini was rearedby his mother and aunt.   He received a traditional Moslem seminary education, entirelyrestricted to Islamic studies, and in the late 1920s began teachingin Qom, center of Shiite teaching in Iran, attracting attention forhis independent views.   According to his brother, at the age of 27, Khomeini marriedKhadijeh, the 16-year-old daughter of a clergyman, and had two sonsand three daughters.   He reportedly took the name Khomeini, from his home village,after his brother, also an ayatollah, was arrested for politcalactivities in 1930.   During the 1930s, Khomeini spoke out against the efforts of themonarch Reza Shah, father of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to reduce therole of the clergy in everyday Iranian life. In 1941, he publishedan essay denouncing the monarch's modernizing policies and foreign_ at that time British _ domination of Iran.   Later that year, the World War II Allies occupied Iran andforced Reza Shah to abdicate in favor of his 21-year-old son.   Although Khomeini regarded the son with the same distrust as thefather, the anti-communist Khomeini distanced himself from theleftist-nationalist movement of Mohammad Mossadeq, which brieflyousted the young shah from power in 1953.   By 1963, however, when Pahlavi initiated a series ofWesternizing measures, Khomeini had become the most powerful voicein opposition.   ``The shah is selling Iran to foreigners. Islam is in peril,''he claimed in a sermon in Qom that led to rioting in whichhundreds, perhaps thousands, of people were killed by governmentforces.   The outspoken ayatollah was arrested shortly after the riotingand, according to his supporters, imprisoned in a sweltering cellwhere he developed breathing problems. In November 1964, he wassent into exile, first to Turkey, then to Iraq, where he settled inthe Shiite shrine city of Najaf.   In exile, the brooding clergyman kept his links with followersin Iran.   ``Our one and only remedy is to bring down those corrupt andcorrupting systems of government,'' he wrote.   Iran, meanwhile, was being transformed by a flood of oildollars. The urban population swelled, universities expanded, moreWestern ways were introduced. Corruption spread within the Iranianelite. Dissent was harshly suppressed.   By 1978, anti-monarchist sentiment was rising quickly,especially among lower-class city dwellers, frozen out of Iran'snew wealth, and unemployed young graduates, overeducated for jobsthat did not exist.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
