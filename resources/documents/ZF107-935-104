Box 7900, MountainView, CA 94039-7900; (415) 961-4400.andM;Nobody likes to fill out forms.andP;  But forms are a way of life in governmentand business alike.andP;  The three forms-management programs reviewed here canmake our forms-cluttered lives easier.andP;  They serve as a bridge to bring thepaper world into sync with the electronic one.andP;  By using a computer to fillout forms, you harness the power of simple calculations; mathematicalformulas; and, in some cases, databases to access names and addresses.andP;  Thismakes filling out forms easier and reduces the margin for error.andP;  Formspackages may be the best way for the traditional paper-based office to makethat sometimes scary leap into using computers.andM;Two of the three programs have been upgraded to new versions: Claris'SmartForm is now in version 1.1 and Abode's TrueForm is in version 2.0.andP;  Athird program, Fast Forms, was acquired by Power Up! from its Canadiandeveloper, Shana, in 1989.andM;Design Your OwnandM;There programs take two approaches to design -- scanning the original paperform or creating one from scratch.andP;  Scanning forms is faster but oftensuffers from poor screen quality.andP;  Creating forms from scratch gives you morecontrol over the final look of the form.andP;  SmartForm and Fast Forms havedesign environments (Claris' is called SmartForm Designer) in which youcreate a form.andP;  Although SmartForm also lets you import scanned images (inPICT format), it provides drawlike tools for sketching out designs -- similarto a page-layout program.andP;  Fast Forms lets you import images only through theClipboard -- a workaround solution at best -- and has most of the draw toolsyou need to create simple forms.andP;  Both programs offer the usual Macdesktop-publishing options: You can define space in inches or points; asnap-to grid aligns objects; and all the fonts, sizes, and styles you haveinstalled are available.andM;The difference between these programs becomes clear when you boot them up.andO;Anyone familiar with the Macintosh interface can create a basic form bypointing and clicking within SmartForm.andP;  Fast Forms has a non-standard Macinterface, however.andP;  Its Font and Style menus are inside a window, not on themenu bar.andM;Neiher SmartForm nor Fast Forms is a great design tool.andP;  The largest formsmaker of them all, the IRS, uses PageMaker, and if you primarily use paperforms, you'd be better off using a dedicated desktop-publishing program too.andO;but DTP was never meant to be the first priority of forms-managementprograms.andP;  In fact, they have sacrificed some traditional DTP tools to givepower to the primary utility in forms management--filling out the forms onthe computer.andM;TrueForm has no page-layout capabilities.andP;  You need either a scanner todigitize a preexisting paper form or a design environment (Adobe recommendsIllustrator 88, of course) to create the form.andP;  TrueForm scans documents fromwithin its TrueForm Set-Up program.andP;  It supports numerous scanners fromcompanies such as DEST, Sharp, Canon, Fujitsu, and Apple.andP;  A compressionalgorithm makes the scanned-image files smaller than normal TIFF files.andO;(Otherwise, the TIFF file would make the form an unwiedly size.)andM;While scanning is a good way to retain continuity between a paper form and anelectronic one, the onscreen results are not always the best quality.andP;  Formsare often designed in an 8-point type size or smaller.andP;  A scanned image withsuch small type can be pretty hard to read on a Mac monitor.andP;  A draw paletewould be welcome for modifying some elements of the original form.andP;  It's bestto have a program with a design environment built inandM;Out in the FieldsandM;After page layout, the next step in forms design is to define fields forentering information.andP;  Field tools lay boxes down on a gird.andP;  In SmartFormand Fast Forms, you size a field box with a field tool as you would arectangle in a draw program.andP;  TrueForm automatically sizes the field box tothe form you've imported as a grid, a feature that speeds up fieldconstruction.andP;  The field box can be resized in all the programs.andM;Field boxes can be defined as text, numbers, dates, or other formats.andP;  FastForms lets you designate numbers as integer, decimal, or dollar amounts;SmartForm and Trueform have more formatting options (this holds true foralmost any element in a comparison of these programs).andP;  TrueForm goes thefurthest in number formating.andP;  You can customize the numbers, for instance,to separate the, millions', thousands', and hundreds' places with periodsinstead of commas (a European convention).andM;Once you've defined what type of information goes into each field, you canlink the boxes to perform calculations.andP;  Common functions (such asmultiplication, division, addition, and substraction, as well as greaterthan, lesser than, and equals) are supported by all the programs.andP;  InSmartForm and TrueForm, even-more-complicated relationships can be defined.andO;You can average several numbers or do a logarithm, which requires using theprogram's scripting language.andP;  Formulas are convenient to build from liststhat contain operators and functions (see Figure 1).andP;  SmartForm and TrueFormalso support logica operators (IF, AND, OR, NOT) for formulas based onconditions.andP;  A time card, for example, can be set to automatically raise anhourly wage to time-and-a-half when more than 40 hours are reported.andM;Both SmartForm and TrueForm have functions that manipulate text.andP;  Aconcatenating function lets you define a field as a word and then join fieldsin a phrase.andP;  For example, you may want an entry form to yield the phrase&quot;Meet (name) at (time).&quot;andP;  (Name) and (time) are variables that the userenters.andM;Function Follows FormandM;The real power in these programs lies in the filling-out stage.andP;  SmartFormand TrueForm use separate applications, SmartForm Assistant and TrueFormFill-Out, respectively, for this purpose.andP;  Fast Forms' fill-out program is aDA -- a good solution for a business that wants to run an accounting programor a database as its primary application.andM;When you fill out a form with any of these packages, the master form is notaltered.andP;  Even though you open the master form within the fill-outapplication, any data you enter must be saved in a different format.andM;Automation is they key to filling out forms.andP;  How many rote tasks can thecomputer do?andP;  All the packages fill in the date automatically -- you definethe field and the way of displaying the date (1/5/90; Jan 5, '90; January5th, 1990; and the like) in the setup stage.andP;  SmartForm adds the option ofchanging the date to when the form is created, filled out, or printed.andM;Each program tries to reduce human error.andP;  If you enter information thatdoesn't match the field type (such as a letter instead of a number), eachprogram responds either by not accepting the data or by displaying an errormessage.andM;To further reduce the chance of errors, SmartForm and TrueForm let you selectinformation from a predefined list.andP;  For example, you might create a listfrom which to choose items for invoices.andP;  You can also include pop-upinstructions for each field, a particularly useful feature in TrueForm, wherethe on-screen resolution of a scanned form can be difficult to read (seeFigure 2).andP;  To further automate the filling-out stage, TrueForm and SmartFormcan set up fields that depend on other fields.andP;  For instance, you can havethe price of an item appear automatically when you type the product name.andM;Filling a form out on a large screen is not dissimilar to filling one out onpaper.andP;  On smaller screen, however, full-page forms scroll across and downthe page as you tab to new fields.andP;  Multipage forms just scroll to the nextpage.andP;  You can define the order of the tab sequence in all three programs.andM;Fast Forms' interface gets in the way of filling out forms.andP;  The DA windowhas no scroll bar or close box (see Figure 3).andP;  You maneuver around withinthe form by using arrows at the bottom of the screen.andM;SmartForm and TrueForm let you group related forms.andP;  SmartForm has Form Sets,and TrueForm has Stacks (no relation to HyperCard stacks).andP;  Both Form Setsand Stacks save only one image of a form while keeping all the data behind itin a databaselike file.andP;  You can perform common search functions within aForm Set or Stack.andP;  For instance, you can search for all the forms createdwithin a certain time period.andP;  You can also search for text strings and formultiple criteria -- such as all sales totaling more than a hundred dollarsmade by a particular clerk.andP;  Each program is capable of grouping forms thatmeet your search criteria.andM;Fast Forms holds data for multiple forms in a text file.andP;  You use the FastForms DA to print forms as you fill them out, and you use the Export Filefunction to put the information into a database.andM;None of these programs fill out forms particularly speedily.andP;  The morecomplicated the form and the bigger the stack, the slower the program runs.andO;I preferred TrueForm for filling in data.andP;  I ran faster for comparable tasks,and the instructions and choice lists were nicely handled.andP;  TrueForm is alsothe only program that smoothly imports complex information from a text fileinto a form's various fields.andM;Printing in SmartForm and TrueForm is simple.andP;  You can print both the dataand the image of the form or just the data if you want to output ontopreprinted forms.andP;  You can customize the print area to a particular size ofpaper as well.andP;  In SmartForm you can print a part number (customer copy,store copy, and so on ) on each respective page for multiple copies of aform.andP;  SmartForm also lets you shrink data to fit within a box.andP;  TrueFormlets you reverse the printing order.andM;Printing is slow with any of these programs.andP;  Fast Forms lives up to its nameby being quicker than SmartForm or TrueForm.andP;  TrueForm is optimized forprinting scanned images, thus sacrificing printing speed for PICT and EPSFimages.andM;The Database and E-MailandM;ConnectionandM;Forms-management programs occupy a middle ground between graphics andpage-layout programs on the one hand and database managers on the other.andO;They address one need of computerized data collection -- making the forms'on-line interface look similar to what you're used to -- without going thewhole distance to database management.andP;  But the future of forms management isclearly tied to databases (see the &quot;Forms and Database Management&quot; sidebar):the more data you collect, the more you have to manage.andP;  Since the kilobyteoverhead of a classy interface is high, you may not see forms managers asfront ends to databases until 2 or 4 megabytes of RAM become common on mostsystems.andP;  (You're less likely to see database capabilities built into formspackages themselves.)andP;  Only TrueForm presently links up with a databaseprogram (4th Dimension).andM;The most intriguing future use of forms packages may be their tie-in toelectronic-mail systems.andP;  (Both QuickMail and Microsoft Mail have rudimentaryforms makers.)andP;  The store-and-forward engine of E-mail would let you routeforms intelligently over a network, earmarked to follow a bureaucratic chainof people to sign off on the form, or to automate electronic invoicing.andP;  Withfeatures such as this, forms-management packages could bring us one stepcloser to the elusive dream of the paperless office.andM;Ben Templin is the former editor-in-chief of MacGuide magazine.andP;  He keeps ingood form by running daily.andP;  One look at his desk tells you that he does notbelive in the paperless office.andM;Forms and Database ManagementandM;Forms-management programs are, in many ways, databases without the data.andO;They make it easy to input information that was traditionally written onpaper forms.andP;  But storing that information and manipulating it in differentways is not within the power of these programs.andP;  Why, then, use a formspackage rather than a database manager?andM;Until recently, many database programs lacked well-designed formscapabilities.andP;  The front end didn't look like traditional paper forms eitheron-screen or on paper.andP;  What's more, you couldn't easily set up a databasethat imitated the data-entry sequence of a complex form.andP;  This made itdifficult to some office workers to make the leap from paper to computer --hence the intermediate virtue of forms packages.andP;  But breaking forms awayfrom a database is like stripping the engine out of a sleek racing car.andP;  Itlooks nice, but it doesn't go anywhere.andP;  The temptation is to return toupgraded databases such as Claris' FileMaker II or ACIUS' 4th Dimension,which have good forms capabilities and give you data management as well.andP;  Youpay more for the increased power, however, and you have to deal with thecomplex, time-consuming process of database form building.andM;Adobe offers a compromise.andP;  TrueForm is the first forms program to link upwith a database, 4th Dimension (somewhat ironic, since 4th Dimension 2.0 hasa much improved forms capability).andP;  A printing module lets you print TrueFormforms from within 4th Dimension.andP;  You can also use 4th Dimension data tocreate a TrueForm stack or add to an existing stack.andP;  But this ia a one-wayapproach to the database-link problem.andP;  You also want to be able to enterdata into the TrueForm sheet and have it slide transparently into a database,which isn't possible with this release.andM;To export data from any of the programs into a database, you must save thedata in a text file.andP;  SmartForm also lets you save the data in SYLK.andP;  DBF,DIF, WKS, or tab-delimited files.andP;  TrueForm goes the extra yard by lettingyou designate which fields you want to export (see Figure A).andP;  Sets of exportsettings can be saved and chosen for different occasions.andP;  A tab, Return, orsome other character can separate fields.andM;But exporting data is a workaround at best.andP;  If forms programs are not goingto provide database capabilities, they need to be a transparent front end todatabases so that you can harness the relational capability of databases suchas 4th Dimension, FoxBASE+, Omnis, or Double Helix.andP;  The only other strategyis to build the shell of a form in a program such as SmartForm and then cutand paste it into your database, adding the entry fields from within thedatabase itself -- another workaround.andP;  Clearly, forms programs need toinclude more-sophisticated features before they can be considered viablealternatives to databases that have good forms capabilities built in.andM;Beta WatchandM;1stSCANandM;For now, stay away from 1stSCAN from 1stDESK.andP;  1stSCAN, despite its name,does not scan forms.andP;  It does, however, open MacPaint or PICT files.andP;  Thedocumentation (which is poor) says it also opens TIFF files (the standardformat for most scanners), but the version sent to us for review (version4.1) did not recognize the TIFF format.andP;  1stSCAN has the same limitedfeatures as Fast Forms but none of its simplicity.andM;1stSCAN's feature set is confined to calculations such as addition,subtraction, multiplication, and division.andP;  The Calculate command has to beinvoked instead of being automatic.andP;  When searching for a particular form ina database of forms, you can easily wait a long time for nothing to happen.andO;Even at beta time, 1stScan isn't in the same class as the other programs.andM;$195.andP;  1stDESK Systems, Inc., 7 Industrial Park Road, Medway, MA 02053; (508)533-4925.andM;Informed DesignerandM;Informed Designer, which was not released at press time, comes from Shana,creator of Fast Forms.andP;  Informed Designer is more Mac-like and more similarto a desktop-publishing tool than Fast Forms, giving precise layout controls.andO;It has pattern menus, a specs palette, and &quot;nudge&quot; commands.andP;  In fieldcalculations, it supports more-sophisticated formulas, such as logarithms andconcatenations, and its search function for a forms stack seems moresophisticated than SmartForm's or TrueForm's (see Figure B).andP;  Database linksare alludedandM;to in the beta manual.andP;   ConsideringandM;its projected price, Informed Designer may be the best value going.andM;$295.andP;  Shana Corp., Suite 105, 9650 20th Ave., Edmonton, Alberta T6N 1G1,Canada; (403) 463-3330.andM;SoftView FormSystemandM;At press time, SoftView, the maker of MacInTax (an excellentpersonal-income-tax-form generator that is approved by the IRS), was workingon SoftView FormSystem, a forms generator that is scheduled to debut inJanuary 1990.andP;  FormSystem promises a new concept in forms generation,graphics intelligence, in which every field and element on a form is aware ofits relationship to all the other elements of the form.andP;  Thus, when oneelement is changed, the spacing and alignment of all the others areautomatically adjusted -- a godsend for creating complex forms.andM;$99.andP;  SoftView, Inc., 1721 Pacific Ave., Suite 100, Oxnard, CA 93033; (805)385-5000.andM;The Elements of Business-Form StyleandM;Good forms design requires a logical, visual arrangement of a form'scomponents to help users supply or retrieve data accurately, completely, andswiftly.andP;  Unfortunately, none of the forms-management packages discussed herecan ensure that users will design forms in such a manner.andP;  So novice formsdesigners should consider these basic tips:andM;A good form is intuitively simple to fill out, but if instructions arenecessary, they should be at the top of the form, where users will encounterthem before they fill out the form.andP;  Only routing instructions should be atthe bottom.andM;Use upper-left-corner captions in boxes to prompt users, so that the captionsare out of the way of the information being written into the data field (seethe first form example).andM;Without contrary knowledge, assume that any form may be filled out by using atypewriter or a computer.andP;  It should accommodate character fields in sixthsof an inch vertically and tenths of an inch horizontally.andP;  Manually completedforms should allow at least one-fifth of an inch for each handwrittencharacter.andM;Use comb tick marks in only two circumstances: to remind users to supplyevery required digit in a field -- such as a Social Security number -- or toprevent them from entering an unlimited number of characters in a field thatmust be stored in a fixed-length database column.andM;Use a sans serif typeface such as a medium-weight Helvetica or Univers forsmall prompting captions.andP;  A style with ornamental serifs may break up at lowresolutions, and fonts with small x heights are harder to read at the smallsizes of forms captions.andP;  Text with uppercase and lowercase letters is easieron the eyes than all caps.andM;The data written on a form should not have to compete with the form itselffor attention.andP;  Use hairline (half-point) rules; occasionally you might useslightly heavier (1-point) rules to divide the form into distinct zones ofrelated data.andP;  Avoid nonfunctional vertical rules that interrupt thehorizontal flow of information.andM;Use lightly tinted backgrounds to highlight related areas of the form, suchas &quot;for office use only&quot; sections.andP;  Be careful, though -- a coarse tintpattern produced on a low-resolution laser printer can obscure the legibilityof any text written into a tinted field.andM;Combine forms that are always attached and travel together.andP;  Allow extra-widemargins for forms with binding or hole-punching requirements.andP;  Do notpreprint anything on a form that can change frequently -- such as routinginstructions to a specific person who may be gone the next day -- when thesame instructions can be expressed in a more permanent way such as routing toa department or title.andM;For more information on forms analysis and design, consult Forms for the'80s: How to Design and Produce Them, a source book edited by Gar Raines(Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: North American Publishing Co., 1980), or theeven more comprehensive Business Forms Handbook, third edition, by John P.andO;Schied (Alexandria, Virginia: National Business Form Association, 1984).andM;The Bottom LineandM;SmartForm and TrueForm run neck and neck, while Fast Forms is a distantthird.andM;MacUser rated Fast Forms at five mice in November 1987.andP;  Back then it was thetop program available.andP;  But it hasn't undergone any major changes, and otherpackages with better features have appeared.andP;  Thus, it is now downgraded tothree mice.andM;That leaves TrueForm and SmartForm For top honors, these two programs cancelone another out more for what they don't have for what they do.andM;SmartForm is the easier package to use.andP;  A robust program that handles manydifferent tasks competently, with a minimum of programming effort, it haseverything you need except database capability.andP;  TrueForm links up with adatabase but has no design environment.andM;From a design perspective, if you have preexisting paper forms that you wanttranslated onto the computer, TrueForm is your best choice.andP;  But if you wantto start from scratch, or if you think you'll revise your forms often, chooseSmartForm.andP;  From a management perspective, TrueForm has a lot more potentialbecause of its database links.andM;Since I'm forced to use either a forms program that has no design capabilitybut has a database connection or one with design capability and no database,I'd sacrifice the design capability and choose TrueForm.andP;  Like many otherusers, I already have a page-layout program that suits me well for formsdesign.andP;  Because most of my time is spent filling out, rather than designingforms, I want the slight edge that TrueForm offers in management tasks.andM;A Few Good FormsandM;If design isn't your forte, consider buying prepackaged forms.andP;  Thesepackages contain commonly used business forms that you can print out and, insome cases, use in fill-out applications.andM;FlexForm BusinessandM;Templates,andM;Volumes I and IIandM;This package comes with a copy of SmartForm Assistant.andP;  Volume 1 containsstockkeeping, production, sales, delivery, billing, and collection forms.andO;Volume 2 has purchasing, receiving, accounting, disbursing, and personnelforms.andP;  Many of these forms are also available in PageMaker format.andP;  You cancustomize and print them for office use.andM;$89.95 per volume.andP;  Antic Software, 544 Second St., San Francisco, CA 94107;(415) 957-0886.andM;FormSetandM;FormSet, from SoftView, the maker of MacIn Tax, is a collection of 65 forms-- including job estimates, earning statements, credit memos, and time cards-- that can be customized with company names and logos.andP;
