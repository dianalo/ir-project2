<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-89-1078 </DOCNO><TEXT>This patent describes an NMR probe having an electrical circuit includingan alternating current power source, an RF coil driven by the power source,tuning circuit means connected to the FR coil for providing a pluralityof resonance frequencies for the RF coil, the tuning circuit means havinga transfer function, and a matching impedance means connected to thetuning circuit to the impedance of the power source. The RF coil of theprobe is multiply-tuned to NMR frequencies for concurrent study of nucleiin a sample as concurrently detected by the RF coil. The transfer functionhas poles in accordance with the NMR frequencies.</TEXT></DOC>
