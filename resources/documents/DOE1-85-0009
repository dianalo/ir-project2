A programme of physics at {similar_to}100 MeV/N developed rapidly, at a time when most of today's custom-builtheavy ion accelerators for more than 20 MeV/N were under constructionor still on the drawing board. The intention was to enable physiciststo perform some immediate experiments and then later to phase out thismode of operation as other machines came on-line. Thus the SC's ion programmewas brought to a close at the beginning of 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
