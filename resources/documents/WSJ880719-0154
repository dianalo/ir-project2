International terrorism and the heightened threat of hijacking has spawned a cottage industry of security companies providing passenger screening and other services under contract with the airlines.    Security in the air has taken on a new sense of urgency following the shooting down of an Iran Air jetliner by a U.S. Navy warship in the Persian Gulf. Big U.S. airlines that fly overseas aren't taking chances on a retaliatory hijacking and have beefed up already tight security measures.    Airline security &quot;is an undertaking of great magnitude; it's a difficult assignment,&quot; said Dick Lally, assistant vice president for security at the Air Transport Association, a Washington trade group that represents the major U.S. carriers.    Since the federal government mandated &quot;100%&quot; screening of airline passengers in 1973, Mr. Lally said, major airlines have stepped up security and refined techniques and equipment. Many carriers have security standards tougher than those of the government.    Each year, U.S. airline and contract security agents uncover and seize 3,000 to 4,000 firearms and make around 1,500 related arrests, the transport group says.    It has become more efficient and cost-effective in many cases for airlines to farm out security work, rather than train more of their staff to handle it. In departure-gate areas shared by several airlines, a common passenger checkpoint is often located in the concourse leading to a gate area, instead of each airline having its own security setup at every gate.    One of the airlines using the gate area usually assumes responsibility for the concourse checkpoint, contracting with an outside security company and splitting the costs of the contract with the other airlines in that section.    Many airlines say they hire outside contractors but refuse to discuss any details or to disclose how much they spend on security. Some U.S. airlines that carry passengers overseas also hire security firms in foreign nations.    Four U.S. airlines -- Pan Am, Trans World Airlines, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit, and NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines unit -- levy a special security charge of $5 a ticket.    Pan Am, like TWA, is one of the most security-conscious U.S. airlines. In addition to its internal-security division and contracts with Wackenhut Corp., a Coral Gables, Fla., security concern, Pan Am's World Services unit sells security, maintenance and other services to government agencies and other airlines.    Wackenhut, which has 28,000 full-time employees and works for nearly all the major U.S. carriers, has a high profile. Last February, armed guards from the company were mobilized at Kennedy International Airport in New York by beleaguered Pan Am Corp., after Teamsters union leaders vowed &quot;guerrilla warfare&quot; against the airline in a wage dispute.    Beefy Wackenhut guards also were in evidence at Texas Air Corp.'s annual meeting last month in New York.    But the handful of other security firms catering to airlines are either closely held or subsidiaries of other companies. Many bigger, better-known security companies had unhappy experiences and got out of airline work.    Airline security &quot;was a segment of business we weren't interested in participating in any longer,&quot; said a spokesman for Baker Industries Inc., parent of both Wells Fargo and Burns International Security Services. The two security units stopped doing airline work, the spokesman said, mainly because of liability problems that could result from hijackings being blamed on inadequate security.    The spokesman said Baker's decision was accelerated by litigation arising from the June 1985 crash of an Air India jumbo jet off the coast of Ireland, which killed all 329 people aboard. The crash was blamed on a bomb planted by Sikh terrorists. The Burns unit, which provided passenger screening for the flight, was named as a defendant by families of the victims in a case pending in the courts.    Wackenhut's spokesman said liability for poor security can be a problem. He stressed, however, that each security contract with the airlines is different and many of them provide for joint liability. </TEXT></DOC>
