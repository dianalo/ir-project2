(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An attorney for the Internal RevenueService told a federal appeals court the agency wants to revokePTL's tax-exempt status even if it means the end of the financiallytroubled ministry.   ``I don't understand why the IRS doesn't take a more practicalapproach to this,'' Judge William Wilkins of the 4th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals on Thursday told the lawyer, Francis Allegra.   Allegra replied, ``The importance here is not just in this case,but it will be felt in other cases.''   Wilkins was part of a three-judge panel that heard an appealfrom the Fort Mill-based ministry to an earlier U.S. District Judgeruling permitting the IRS to revoke the ministry's tax-exemptstatus. Earlier this month, Wilkins granted a stay of that rulingpending review by the appeals court, which is expected to make itsdecision within two weeks.   The IRS seeks to make the revocation retroactive to May 31,1981. It contends that contributions funded the lavish lifestylesof ministry founders Jim and Tammy Bakker, who resigned after ascandal over a sexual encounter Bakker had with former churchsecretary Jessica Hahn, and that much of PTL's Heritage Village USAoperations were commercial in nature.   Allegra said failure to revoke PTL's tax-exempt status couldcost the federal government between $55 million and $82 million inback taxes.   PTL attorney R. Bradford Leggett told the judges that loss ofits tax-exempt status would jeopardize the ministry's ability toreorganize itself under federal bankruptcy court protection by aMay 1 deadline.   Wilkins suggested to Allegra that the IRS could jeopardize itsability to collect back taxes if it succeeds in revoking PTL'sstatus before May 1.   Allegra acknowleged the agency's action could jeopardize taxpayments, but he said to allow PTL a further stay is to inviteabuse, adding that the ministry could ask the court for additionalstays after May 1.   PTL spokesman Dave West said the ministry is aware it will haveto settle with the IRS eventually.   ``But if we do not continue under the protection of thebankruptcy court, then the IRS can come in and supersede the workof the bankruptcy court,'' West said.   ``At the very minimum, the IRS' actions should be held inabeyance,'' he said.   PTL is in the midst of a ``March to Victory'' telethon that aimsto raise $4.2 million by May 1 to meet the bankruptcy court'sreorganization plan. The ministry has debts estimated at $60million and so far has raised $2.2 million, West said.</TEXT></DOC>
