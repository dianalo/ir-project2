The three most important techniques continue tobe infarct-avid imaging with Tc-99m pyrophosphate, myocardial imagingwith T1-201, and radionuclide ventriculography. The most important technicaldevelopments affecting these procedures are single-photon emission CTand the continued improvement of automated quantitative analysis programsas adjuncts to interpretation and diagnosis of the nuclear cardiologyimages. The development of new myocardial imaging agents labeled withTc-99m appears now to be a clinical reality and potentially representsthe most significant technical breakthrough in nuclear cardiology inthe past several years. The characteristics and the potential of thesenew agents are explored.</TEXT></DOC>
