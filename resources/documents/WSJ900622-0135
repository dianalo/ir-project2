Goodness knows where we'll put this year's batch.&quot;   Behind him, a line of people waiting to make 1989 incometax declarations stretches into the street. As the June 20deadline neared, the scene in the Hortaleza district taxoffice illustrated the government's success in widening itstax net.</LP><TEXT>   But it also underlined one of Spain's principalshortcomings: cumbersome bureaucracy. Paying taxes may mean&quot;investing in Spain,&quot; as government-financed billboards onSpanish highways proclaim, but up-front conditions areonerous. This office in suburban Madrid is open to the publicfrom 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday to Friday. Until Mr. Lopez deVeraza put a stop to it recently, employees used to take&quot;coffee breaks&quot; to go shopping during office hours. Even whenthey're on duty, taxpayers may have to wait in line forhours.   Now, the government has embarked on an overhaul of Spain'stax system that could help reduce some of the queues. Incometaxes are expected to be lowered slightly, and indirect taxesincreased. But the changes aren't a change of heart on thepart of Spain's Socialist government. Rather, they are beingforced on it by future freedom for capital movements in theEuropean Community. If Spanish income taxes are higher thanthose in other EC countries, Spain could face a big outflowof funds. Some savvy Spaniards are already moving theirfiscal residence abroad.   Until now, in a nation where tax dodging is something of anational pastime, Spanish fiscal policy has relied more onsticks than on carrots. A top marginal income tax rate of 56%starts on taxable incomes above 8,240,000 pesetas ($79,000).Wealth tax starts at 0.2% on taxable assets above ninemillion pesetas, rising to 2% above 2.5 billion pesetas. Theprinciple of progressively increasing taxation of incomes isenshrined in the constitution. The only safeguard is a clausestipulating that total taxes under both headings can't exceed70% of an individual's annual income.   Faced with widespread tax evasion, the government has doneits best to enforce the rules. In the past few years, it hasdoubled the number of tax inspectors and uncoveredlarge-scale tax frauds, for example, in single-premium lifeinsurance policies.   In Spain's property market, it has taken steps to preventthe underdeclaration of sales values by saying it will taxany difference between sales prices and market values as agift. It has announced plans for special taxes on real estatebought through offshore companies under a system used bynon-residents and even some Spaniards to avoid Spanish taxes.   Later this year, Spaniards will be issued with fiscalidentity cards, the use of which will be obligatory in allsorts of transactions from opening a bank account to buying ahouse. Due largely to successful tax policing, the governmenthopes to eliminate its budget deficit in 1992.   What it hasn't succeeded in doing, however, is toestablish a consensus that taxes are fair. Wealthy Spaniardscomplain that they're being taxed too much, while laborunions allege that many high earners don't declare as much asthey should.   Last year, the constitutional court forced thegovernment's hand by ruling that a system for taxing marriedcouples was unfair. Couples were being charged on theircombined income at the same marginal rates as applied toindividuals. The result of the court's ruling was afive-month delay in tax declarations while the governmentamended the law. The change finally saved couples around 300billion pesetas in income tax.   Now, in an effort to win support for future tax policy,the government has consulted economists and labor unions andplans to open talks soon with employers. On Friday, a cabinetmeeting spent several hours discussing the issue. Officialssay they hope to get draft legislation ready to present toParliament next month.   But the planned changes, though going some way towardmaking Spain's tax system simpler, aren't expected to amountto a tax revolution. The principle of progressive taxationwill be maintained, officials say. Though red tape will bereduced in some areas, it's likely to be increased in others,they admit.   Income taxes are expected to be lowered slightly, for bothhigh and modest incomes. Top marginal income tax rates may bereduced, either by cutting the top rate a few points or byraising the threshold at which it comes into effect.   Capital gains, at present taxed as income, are expected tobe treated more favorably, particularly for long-terminvestments. They won't be taxed at all in cases where theinitial investment is below a specified limit. Total revenuefrom income taxes is likely to fall 5% to 12%.   But the reduction in revenues will be compensated for byhigher value-added taxes and excise taxes. The ordinary VATrate is expected to rise from 12% to 14% or more. A luxuryVAT rate of 33% is expected sooner or later to be reduced tomatch the ordinary rate. In the case of cars, the differencewill probably be made up for by a registration fee.</TEXT></DOC>
