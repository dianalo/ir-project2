RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today turned down the appealof a philosophy professor denied an opportunity to address Congressabout secular humanism during the lawmakers' daily moments ofopening prayer.   The court, over one dissenting vote, refused to hear argumentsthat the professor's rights were violated.   Justice Byron R. White voted to review the case more fully.   Paul Kurtz, who teaches philosophy at the State University ofNew York in Buffalo, said he unlawfully was denied an invitation tomake remarks to Congress about his humanist beliefs. He had askedthe chaplains of the Senate and House to let him speak during thetime designated for opening prayers.   Kurtz said he was barred from speaking because he told thechaplains he would not lead the lawmakers in prayer.   ``The opening ceremonies of our nation's legislature, if theyclaim to represent anybody, must represent everybody, the religiousand non-religious alike,'' Kurtz's lawyer argued.   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here threw out Kurtz's suitlast September.   The chaplains of the House and Senate occasionally invite gueststo deliver the opening prayers. Kurtz wrote to the chaplains in1984, seeking to address either or both houses.   He said, ``As a secular humanist, I would not, of course, invokeany deity during my remarks. I do believe that it is important,however, (for members of Congress) occasionally to have theopportunity to hear non-theists speak of moral responsibilities.''   Both chaplains declined to invite him. The Senate chaplain saidKurtz must have a senator sponsor him to receive an invitation. TheHouse chaplain told him that each House session must begin with aprayer.   Kurtz then sued the chaplains and Treasury Secretary James A.Baker. His suit named Baker on grounds that the treasury providedtaxpayer money to fund the chaplain programs in Congress.   The appeals court threw out his suit on grounds that thechaplains lacked the authority to permit Kurtz to speak. Thatdeprives Kurtz of legal standing to sue, the appeals court said.   The rare privilege for outsiders of addressing either houserequires approvals of the members of each house, the appeals courtsaid.   ``Even if the chaplains had agreed to invite Kurtz, it would beunreasonable to imagine that they could have provided him with theactual opportunity to deliver non-religious remarks to either houseof Congress during the time expressly set aside for prayer,'' theappeals court said.   The Reagan administration urged the justices to reject Kurtz'sappeal, but on different grounds.   Justice Department lawyers said Kurtz must lose his case becausea 1983 Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of prayers thatopen each day of the Nebraska Legislature. The court said suchprayers do not violate Constitution's establishment clauserequiring separation of church and state.   ``So too is it untenable to contend, as (Kurtz) does, that theframers (of the Constitution) intended the establishment orfree-speech component of the First Amendment as equal-timeprovisions, mandating non-theistic speech-making whenever Congresspermits religious invocations,'' the government lawyers said.   The case is Kurtz vs. Baker, 87-1581.</TEXT></DOC>
