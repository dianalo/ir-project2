Officials say President Bush will exercise his right to lift theban, imposed by Congress several months ago, on grounds of U.S.national interests. The officials, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said the move is expected within several weeks.   U.S. oil companies and other businesses have exerted heavypressure on the administration to broaden trade ties with Iraqsince the 1988 end of its ruinous eight-year war with Iran. Theadministration wants to increase its influence over the governmentof Iraqi strongman Sadam Hussein, who commands one of the MiddleEast's strongest and most proven armies, as well as the world'ssecond-largest proven oil reserves.   However, the move may anger lawmakers who are expected to takeup debate over reports of recent Iraqi testing of two long-rangemissiles when Congress returns of the holiday recess next month.   Iraq announced the testing earlier this month, saying it hadalso test-fired a rocket able to carry satellites into space. ThePentagon confirmed the test-firings, but has declined to discuss itfurther.   U.S. officials say they are concerned by the implications ofsuch a missile program for the arms race in the Middle East, andhave raised their concerns with the Iraqis.   Critics also say the administration failed to act against Iraqfor attacking its Kurdish minority with nerve and mustard gas lastyear.   Congress voted to suspend $200 million in annual short-termcredits to Iraq by the Export-Import Bank, a U.S. governmentinstitution that promotes the export of American goods. To head offa presidential veto and respond to pressure from U.S. businesses,Congress agreed to incorporate the executive branch's right to awaiver.   ``But there were many up here who didn't like it and wanted aflat-out prohibition on Iraq,'' said a congressional source whospoke on condition he not be named.   ``We couldn't do that. Iraq is a major untapped market for theU.S. in the Middle East,'' said one official, also speaking oncondition of anonymity.   Even with the credit problems, U.S. exports to Iraq nearlydoubled from 1987 to 1988, reaching $1.2 billion. For the firstnine months of 1989 exports totaled $909 million, mostlyagricultural commodities, according to Commerce Departmentstatistics.   American oil imports from Iraq have risen sharply, from a dailyaverage of 83,000 barrels in 1987 to 345,000 barrels in 1988,according to Energy Department figures. The year-end figures for1989 are expected to show about a 40 percent increase over 1988.   Iraq has run up a debt to foreign governments and banksestimated at between $30 billion and $70 billion.   In the long-run, Iraq's past performance and future oil capacitymake it a worthy credit risk. The government plans to increase itsdaily oil output from 2.5 million barrels to 4 million once its oilterminals, damaged in the war, are repaired.   The Baghdad government is eager to attract U.S. business so itcan profit from American technology and build up itsexport-oriented industries.</TEXT></DOC>
