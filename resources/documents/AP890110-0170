Hussein met with Republican Sens. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas andJohn McCain of Arizona, and then with Reps. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio;James Hansen, R-Utah; and James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.   Hussein said Jordan's renunciation in July to claims to theIsraeli-occupied West Bank has led to stronger relations betweenJordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization, according to thenews agency.   Kassebaum, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,said in an interview before meeting Hussein that she favored ``alittle more even hand'' in balancing U.S. support for Israel andArab nations.   But she said the senators told Israeli and Jordanian officialsthat U.S. budget problems ``are not going to make any changes easy.''   Kassebaum said she supported the U.S. decision to open talks withthe PLO after chairman Yasser Arafat's decision to renounceterrorism and accept Israel's right to exist.   But renewed terrorist activity ``would mean everything was offagain in terms of recognizing the PLO,'' she said.   Kassebaum also said Israel's tough response to Palestinianprotests in the occupied territories has weakened U.S. publicsupport for Israel.   ``Constituent mail comments back home clearly reflect thatAmericans want not just to unquestioningly provide major amounts ofmoney to Israel without saying, `Just a minute now, you have someproblems, too.'''   Kassebaum and McCain, a member of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, planned to arrive in Syria Wednesday night and in EgyptThursday.</TEXT></DOC>
