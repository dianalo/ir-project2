The fund, to be managed by the World Bank and two UnitedNations agencies, will help developing nations startconverting their industries to ozone-friendly technologies.As the first large fund targeted at a specific globalenvironmental ill, the fund may become a model for how theworld will finance such other problems as the threat ofglobal warming and the loss of species.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We are establishing a new political mechanism to dealwith the environmental crisis,&quot; said Mostafa Tolba, executivedirector of the United Nations Environment Program.   The fund will pay the first three years of developingcountries' efforts to phase out use of chlorofluorocarbons,or CFCs, halons and carbon tetrachloride -- all man-madechemicals, used in refrigerators, air conditioners, spraycans and factories -- which eat away the atmosphere'sprotective layer of ozone gas. The developed nations, whichrepresent 85% of world consumption of these chemicals, areexpected to agree here tomorrow to ban usage by either 1997or 2000. The world's developing nations will have an extradecade to ban the substances, but say they will still needfinancial help from the fund to adopt ozone-friendlysubstitutes.</TEXT></DOC>
