A preliminary injunction issued by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge BurtonR. Lifland in New York notes that violators of the order could befined or jailed for contempt.   The injunction covers Hartsfield International Airport inAtlanta and New York's LaGuardia Airport and stems from hearingsconducted by Lifland in New York from March 22 to Oct. 4.   ``We consider this a very significant order,'' said Easternspokesman Robin Matell. ``It puts the strikers on notice thatthreatening behavior will not be tolerated and they will have topay the price for their actions.''   Matell said the two airports have been the sites of mostproblems between Eastern workers and Machinists since the strikebegan March 4. Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcyreorganization five days later.   On Sunday, seven strikers were arrested in Atlanta after picketspelted cars with rocks and injured one Eastern worker. Lifland onWednesday ordered 13 Machinists to appear at a Dec. 12 hearing onpossible civil contempt charges.   The injunction prohibits the pickets from blocking entrances orharassing Eastern employees or passengers. They are also bannedfrom trespassing on any Eastern property at the two airports andfrom making loud noises.   In addition, strikers are blocked from vandalizing or defacingany property of Eastern or its customers, including placingstickers criticizing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo. TexasAir is the parent of Miami-based Eastern.   The strikers can have no more than two people conductingstrike-related activities inside the terminals at the airports.   At Hartsfield, the strikers are prohibited from massdemonstrations at some terminal exits and entrances. The strikers'tent city compound must be far enough from Eastern property soobjects cannot be thrown at buildings, according to the order.   At LaGuardia, the order limits the size of the picket line to 12people at arrival and departure areas. Also, the lines must be atleast 40 feet from the terminal entrance and 20 feet from thebaggage claim exit area.   ``We haven't done anything improper,'' said Machinist spokesmanAl Hanson in Miami. ``The Atlanta incident was prompted by someonewho charged the picket line ... They are doing everything in theirpower to cripple the union and keep us from our First Amendmentrights of free speech and assembly.''   Lifland also ordered that a condensed version of the injunctionbe mailed to each of the more than 8,000 Machinists, which includeaircraft mechanics, bag handlers and other ground workers.   Contract talks are presently ongoing between Eastern and itspilots and flight attendants unions, which decided to end their8{-month sympathy strikes last week.</TEXT></DOC>
