Also Wednesday, a commander for the U.S.-backed guerrillasannounced his fighters have started a northern offensive to cutSoviet supply routes to Kabul.   In the south, guerrillas reportedly pushed back a 1,000-vehiclearmy convoy with winter provisions for the country's second largestcity, Kandahar.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 14 rocketsstruck in and around the capital's joint military-civilian airport.However, airport workers and other witnesses put the number at 25 ormore.   More than 300 people have been killed and 700 injured in almostdaily rocket attacks since June by the guerrillas.   Amani said shrapnel from one explosion Wednesday killed afirefighter at the airport's fire station.   He said one rocket also hit a mosque in the neighborhood of BibiMahro, next to the airport, killing a priest and wounding four otherpeople.   However, several residents interviewed by reporters around themosque said no rockets fell, and nobody was killed or injured.   Airport workers and other witnesses said at least one soldier waskilled and three wounded, but Amani said he had no information aboutthose casualties.   Amani said shrapnel from another rocket knocked holes in thefuselage of a U.N. jet and also damaged a Tupolov 154 jet belongingto Ariana, the national airlines.   U.N. officials said they patched the holes with special metaltape. They said no one was injured by the rocket, however.   The plane arrived carrying Benom Sevann, spokesman for U.N.observers monitoring the 10-year-old civil war between theSoviet-backed Afghan government and the Moslem guerrillas, who arealso backed by Pakistan.   Airport workers also said a Soviet-designed Antonov-12 caughtfire when it was hit by a rocket while taxiing toward the runway.They said the crew jumped off.   However, a government spokesman said the plane had not burned.   The Marxist government uses the planes to ferry militaryequipment, food and other supplies to provincial capitals around thecountry because the guerrillas control the roads in many rural areas.   In neighboring Pakistan, Western diplomatic sources said a hugeAfghan army convoy of trucks, tanks and armored personnel carriersfrom the Soviet Union was turned back from Kandahar by fierceguerrilla attacks.   Its original size reportedly was 1,000 to 1,300 vehicles, butdiplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theinsurgents may have destroyed more than 110 vehicles.   Afghan government officials said the convoy was carryingprovisions for 200,000 people in besieged Kandahar.   The convoy had pushed to within 36 miles of Kandahar before itwas forced back, the diplomatic sources said.   At latest report, the column had retreated 33 miles and splitinto two, with helicopters lifting some of the cargo to Kandahar.   Meanwhile, guerrilla commander Ahmad Shah Masoud sent a radiomessage to Pakistan, where the insurgents are based, saying hisforces were attacking four areas along the key Salang Highway northof Kabul, including the government's biggest air force base atBagram.   ``His message gave us no details about casualties, but he saidthe mujahedeen (guerrillas) gained some very big successes,especially at Salang,'' said Masoud Khalili, a spokesman of theJamiat-i-Islami rebel group.   The diplomatic sources said intense fighting continued around theeastern garrison town of Khost, with high casualties on both sides.   The guerrillas have failed to capture a major Afghan city sincethe last Soviet forces withdrew from the civil war on Feb. 15. TheSoviets still supply the government with weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
