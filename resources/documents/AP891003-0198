The occupation began Aug. 20 with eight wounded entering thechurch and the number had reached 48 by last weekend, annoying boththe rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani and RomanCatholic Church leaders.   ``The cathedral is not a hotel,'' Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas,archbishop of San Salvador, said late last month in an appeal tovacate the church.   The guerrillas had said they would stay in the cathedral untilthey and wounded comrades on battlefronts were given safe conductout of the country for medical treatment.   But Rivera Damas' chagrin apparently changed their minds. RedCross vans took the 46 men and two women from the cathedral to theMexican Embassy.   One man who said he lost his right arm in combat, told TheAssociated Press through the embassy gate the wounded will notcomment on future plans until arrangements were worked out with theMexican ambassador.   Access to the embassy was barred. Repeated telephone calls wentunanswered.   Earlier, insurgents denounced Cristiani's speech Monday to theU.N. General Assembly in which he called for a cease-fire in the10-year-old civil war.   Cristiani, who took office June 1, said his government wouldpropose a complete cessation of hostilities during peace talks withrebels scheduled for Oct. 16-17 in Costa Rica.   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, umbrellafor five guerrilla groups, has insisted an agreement must bereached on democratic reforms before the war can end.   Joaquin Villalobos, a rebel negotiator, said, ``We wantdemocracy and peace. It must be in that order, because if peacecomes before democracy, it will be the peace of the cemetery.''   The rebels demand an end to what they call official repression,an overhaul of the judiciary and reduction of the armed forces.   ``Cristiani filled his speech with words like human rights,peace and democracy. At the same time what we're seeing is a waveof arrests of members of popular organizations ... tortures,disappearances and murders,'' said the rebels on their clandestineRadio Venceremos.   Vice President Francisco Merino told journalists Monday the callfor a cease-fire ``is not a call for the surrender of the FMLN.''He said a cessation of hostilities ``would create appropriateconditions for the search for lasting peace.''   The rebels observed an 11-day unilateral cease-fire betweenSept. 13-23 for the preliminary talks. They accused the governmentof taking advantage of the truce to move forces intoguerrilla-controlled zones and arrest leaders of labor and peasantorganizations considered guerrilla fronts by authorities.</TEXT></DOC>
