(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of protesters marched in thecapital of Soviet Georgia on Monday after 10 days of ethnicviolence in the republic's western region, and organizers of astrike said it had affected 33 factories.   A day of marches in Tbilisi culminated in an evening rallyattended by 2,000 people shouting ``Freedom from the U.S.S.R.!''and slogans protesting the alleged failure of authorities toprotect Georgians from armed attacks in the Black Sea region ofAbkhazia.   In Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the nationallegislature ethnic unrest in Abkhazia had spread to Tbilisi,causing ``the disorganization of transportation'' on Monday,adding: ``The situation became acute.''   Most stores and other businesses appeared to be open, but IrakliTseretel, a leader of the Georgian Party of National Independenceand a rally organizer, claimed 33 factories were closed, includingtwo military plants.   Tseretel's report could not be confirmed and three otherinformal groups that favor Georgian independence were boycottingthe strike, fearing a repeat of April 9, when 20 demonstrators diedat the hands of soldiers.   Another speaker at the rally, Zviad Gamsachurdia, demanded thearrests of those responsible for attacks on ethnic Georgians inAbkhazia, a separate administrative area within the republic.   An editor at the Georgian news agency Gruzinform said buses didnot appear Monday morning in some regions of Tbilisi, but thatservice was normal by midday.   The interrupted bus service appeared linked to a transit strike,including a railway walkout that began over the weekend and endedMonday. Tass, the official news agency, said the rail strikestranded thousands of people.   Several hundred people demonstrated throughout the day incentral Tbilisi, protesting the violence in Abkhazia.   ``When those Abkhazians started to knife Georgians, it justdrove us out of our minds,'' said the news agency editor, NanaGelashvili.   Tass said no armed clashes had been reported in Georgia orAbkhazia for two days, but it reported more confiscations ofweapons from extremists by internal security troops and police.   Authorities seized 104 rifles and more than 500 pounds ofexplosives in the previous 24 hours and found a cache of 130 poundsof explosives and 6,500 feet of detonating cable near the Abkhazianvillage of Gvandra, Tass said.   Residents of Abkhazia voluntarily turned in 744 firearms, theagency reported.   Nineteen people have been reported killed and more than 400injured since July 15 in clashes between warring Georgians andAbkhazians in the seaside resort area 880 miles south of Moscow.   Two regional Communist Party secretaries and two governmentleaders in Abkhazia were dismissed Saturday.   Each ethnic group blames the other for the trouble. Abkhazians,a minority in their own region, want more economic independence andcultural rights. Georgians insist the enclave remain part of theirCaucasus republic.   During the past month, at least 132 people have been killed inethnic unrest in the southern Soviet republics of Georgia,Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan.</TEXT></DOC>
