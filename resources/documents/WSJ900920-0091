The uananimous court decision allows government officialsto proceed with a massive environmental study of Nevada'sYucca Mountain, about one hundreds miles northeast of LasVegas, as a burial site for radioactive wastes. The state hasmounted several legal challenges to the federal plan since1987, and the state Legislature has passed hostileresolutions and refused to supply the government withnecessary environmental permits.</LP><TEXT>   The three-judge panel rejected state arguments that thefederal government was violating constitutional protectionsof state rights, as well as provisions of the U.S. NuclearWaste Policy Act. The state attorney general had argued inAugust before the court that Congress failed to overrideNevada's disapproval notice within the 90 days required underthe 1982 act.   In his decision, federal Judge Arthur Alarcon assertedthat the U.S. energy secretary was correct in arguing thatthe U.S. Constitutions's 10th amendment &quot;does not protect astate from being outvoted in Congress.&quot;   Originally the federal government was considering fivesites in Mississippi, Utah, Texas, Washington and Nevada.Since 1987, the government has narrowed the list to three --in Hannaford, Wash., Deafsmith, Texas, and Yucca Mountain --and more recently dropped all but the Nevada location.   Nevada can appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Courtor ask the appellate court for reconsideration. State DeputyAttorney General Harry Swainston wouldn't say whether thestate will appeal until he reads the decision. But in August,state Attorney General Brian McKay vowed &quot;to use every toolpossible&quot; to keep the dump site out of the state.   The federal energy officials have said that its &quot;siteverification study&quot; would take about six to ten years tocomplete. So far, government researchers have bored severalexploratory holes in the mountainside, but their work largelyhalted in the face of state resistance.</TEXT></DOC>
