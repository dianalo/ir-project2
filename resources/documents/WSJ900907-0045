Then heturned to the major business of the day: demanding that hiscabinet members switch their attention from the Persian Gulfto the economic problems here at home.   Moans and groans -- literally -- went up around thecabinet room.</LP><TEXT>   Budget director Richard Darman described how the Gulfcrisis was rapidly adding billions to the nation's yawningbudget deficit. Economic adviser Michael Boskin described thebillions in growth that the crisis was shaving from thealready-anemic economy. &quot;There weren't a lot of pleasantsurprises,&quot; says an official who attended the meeting.   Today, the crunch will hit President Bush even harder. Forthe past month, he has had something of a free ride. Congresswas on vacation. Domestic policy was on hold. Public supportsurged on a wave of patriotism. But this morning,unemployment figures will offer the first glimpse of theeconomy's condition in the wake of the Mideast blowup. Andbudget negotiators returning to the bargaining table willfind themselves more divided than ever as the Iraq crisiscomplicates their task of cutting the deficit.   Mr. Bush's aggressive Persian Gulf policy and the economicmess are about to collide head-on. How he handles theseproblems in the next several weeks will help determinewhether the U.S. has the resources and the will to supportits global superpower role.   Difficult as the Iraq situation is, the problems at homemay be even more daunting. &quot;The foreign policy area is easierto solve, in my view, than the domestic,&quot; says Donald Regan,the former Treasury secretary and White House chief of staff.&quot;The domestic economic problems are a terrible bag of worms.&quot;   Consider:   -- A new internal White House analysis suggests that theMiddle East crisis could push the nation's budget deficitover the $250 billion mark next year. And that estimate maybe conservative; Rudolph Penner, an economist at the UrbanInstitute who once headed the Congressional Budget Office,thinks a tough recession could send it closer to $400billion. Mr. Bush will personally meet with the congressionalnegotiators in this morning's round of budget talks. But evenhis own advisers are split over whether to be confrontationalor accommodating with Democrats in the quest for adeficit-cutting agreement, say administration sources.   -- America's foreign-aid budget, which already appeareddeficient for the changing world of the '90s, looksthoroughly inadequate in light of new demands from theMideast showdown. The U.S. now faces multibillion-dollarrequests from its allies in the region, as well as continuingpressure to help Eastern Europe, Latin America, and possiblyeven a struggling Soviet Union.   -- Rising oil prices continue pushing the U.S. economytoward recession at a time when unprecedented corporate debtand a weak financial system may make recession far moreperilous than usual. And faced with the ballooning budgetdeficit, the president is virtually powerless to use federalspending or tax policy to stimulate the economy.   The president -- and the nation -- have much at stake.With the Soviets facing even worse economic problems, theU.S. has shown in the last few weeks it is the only nationstill capable of acting as a superpower in the currentcrisis. But now, as Mr. Bush prepares to meet Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev this weekend, he also must show thatAmerica can get its domestic house in order.   &quot;We tend to think of these things as a domestic quarrel ina family,&quot; says Bobby Inman, a former deputy director ofCentral Intelligence. &quot;But in fact, the whole world iswatching.&quot;   Unless Mr. Bush can score surprising success in breakingthe economic-policy deadlock, the result could be a new worldorder in which the U.S. assumes the traditional superpowerrole in political and military leadership, but must rely onfinancial help from its friends around the world.   Already the costs of the Mideast crisis are forcingTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Secretary of StateJames Baker to trek hat-in-hand across Europe and Asiaseeking help in paying for the military operation and inaiding key allies such as Egypt and Turkey -- &quot;aninternational United Way campaign,&quot; Indiana Sen. RichardLugar calls it.   Bush aides say they hope the crisis will pull together theWhite House and Congress in a new resolve to quit bickeringand address budget and economic problems. But for that tohappen, the president would have to convince Congress and thepublic that sacrifices are necessary, in the form of bigdomestic spending cuts or tax increases.   Will the nation emerge from the Gulf crisis with anythingmore than a bigger budget deficit? &quot;It depends on whether wecan get the administration to finally deliver bad news to theAmerican public, as well as good,&quot; maintains Rep. David Obey,a Wisconsin Democrat who heads the appropriationssubcommittee that handles foreign aid.   Like the vacationing Congress, the American public has,for a while, given the president plenty of running room todeal with Saddam Hussein. &quot;This has been a short-termpolitical plus,&quot; says Stuart Eizenstat, who was PresidentCarter's domestic policy adviser. &quot;It has boosted thepresident's popularity and taken people's minds off Neil Bushand the savings and loans and a declining economy.&quot;   But eventually, he and others agree, the problems closerto home will overtake the fervent support of U.S. policy inthe Mideast. &quot;The American people have a very short attentionspan,&quot; Mr. Eizenstat says. &quot;If there's a standoff, attentionwill begin to shift&quot; to the domestic quandary.   And the domestic problems will have been made all theworse by the Gulf confrontation. Here is a look at theseproblems, and how they may play out over the coming weeks:                                                                                                          Budget Deficit                                                                                                          When President Bush came into office last year, he vowedto address the deficit. &quot;We will not have the luxury oftaking the easy, spendthrift approach to solving problems,&quot;he said in a televised speech. But now, owing in part to theGulf crisis, he appears headed for deficits dwarfing even theleviathan ones of the Reagan years.   The direct costs of the military operation are only asmall part of the problem. Those costs, the Pentagon says,are running about $30 million a day, and congressional budgetofficials estimate the cost in the fiscal year beginning Oct.1 at $6 billion to $8 billion.   More troublesome are the effects on the deficit ofoil-induced economic slowing. &quot;The prospect of going into arecession with a $200 billion deficit is phantasmagoric,&quot;says Mr. Eizenstat. &quot;We would come out of the recession witha deficit so huge that it would stymie the ability oflawmakers to do anything about it.&quot;   Though White House and congressional budget negotiatorsresume talks today, the Iraq crisis will make reaching aconsensus far more difficult. Mr. Darman argues that a $50billion deficit cut next year (the official target) is moreimportant than ever before. Others, however, say such a bigpackage could cause further damage to the economy. Somemembers of Congress expect a more modest package of only $20billion to $35 billion in spending cuts and tax increases.And House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia has launched acampaign for tax cuts, to stimulate the sagging economy.   Some analysts have talked of a special tax increase to payfor the Gulf deployment, but such a tax would be a recipe forshattering the Republicans' coalition on national security.Some prominent GOP conservatives have been arguing that theU.S. should stay out of the fight over Kuwait. Those sameconservatives are the party's most virulent opponents of newtaxes; they would be especially agitated over a specialPersian Gulf tax.   The president will have to wage a mighty battle to wringout a meaningful budget agreement. But, notes Mr. Eizenstat,&quot;the time and energy the administration can devote toeconomic and budgetary issues right now has got to belimited.&quot;                                                                                                          Foreign Aid                                                                                                          Without some radical change, Mr. Bush simply won't be ableto find enough money to help all the countries that seeminglydeserve American help now.   His first move to aid Mideast allies came this week, whenthe president asked Congress to forgive some $7 billion inmilitary debts owed by Egypt. That move has built upexpectations of help for others that probably will have to bedashed.   Turkey, which has played a critical role by shutting anIraqi oil pipeline, has $1.25 billion in military debts tothe U.S. that it too may want forgiven. Israel, which theU.S. considers its most reliable Mideast ally, quicklysignaled that it wants its $4.5 billion in military andcivilian debts forgiven as well. Israel plans to seekhundreds of millions of dollars of additional militaryassistance as well, to confront the Iraqi military threat.   And the administration already was having trouble scrapingup money to help emerging democracies in Eastern Europe andLatin America. Six weeks ago, many in Congress thought thedefense budget could be robbed for cash to spread around tothem, cementing in place a more stable post-Cold War world.But now slashing defense seems politically reckless.   So the foreign-aid pie won't grow much. The House hasfinished work on a $15.6 billion foreign-aid bill for nextyear, a billion dollars more than this year but not nearly asmuch as the U.S. could use. All told, the foreign-aid programnow is a shadow of what it was in the post-World War IIperiod, when the U.S. devoted 2% to 3% of its gross nationalproduct to foreign aid. Today, it devotes less than 0.3%.                                                                                                          The Economy                                                                                                          Administration officials continue to predict that theeconomy will narrowly escape recession, but many privateanalysts are far less optimistic. In any event, the nation isclearly facing a very sluggish period.   For Mr. Bush, two things compound the problem. With thedeficit out of control, he has few spending or tax tools tocushion the blow or add economic stimulus. And second, thesorry state of the nation's financial system makes anyslowdown particularly precarious.   For the savings and loan fiasco, rising oil prices mayturn out to be a blessing; increased oil drilling in Texascould eventually raise the value of some of the foreclosedproperty the U.S. holds.   But in the banking community, many institutions are on thebrink of trouble. William Seidman, head of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation, says the FDIC now has nearly1,000 on its problem-bank list, quadruple the number of adecade ago. A nationwide recession could push many of thosebanks over the edge, quickly outweighing any benefits reapedby Sandamp;Ls in the Southwest.   &quot;In the postwar era, we've never gone into a recessionwith anywhere near the same number of problem banks,&quot; saysRobert Litan of the Brookings Institution. &quot;It means a lotmore bank failures.&quot; And bank failures, in turn, couldundermine confidence in the economy and make the recessioneven deeper.</TEXT></DOC>
