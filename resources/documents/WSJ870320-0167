When members of the 44-country lending organization gather in Miami this weekend for their annual meeting, the U.S. again will seek changes that effectively would give Washington the power to veto proposed IADB loans to member countries. Washington argues that as the organization's largest donor it should have such say, but Latin countries oppose the idea as politically intolerable.    While neither side expects to resolve the dispute, each will be able to air views they have been expressing for some time in private, occasionally pushing negotiations into a more serious phase.    There is quite a bit at stake for the 27-year-old development bank. The Reagan administration has promised that if the organization's members agree to the changes Washington is proposing, the U.S. will help finance a major expansion of lending resources to $20 billion over the next four years -- enough to make the institution a serious player in the effort to resolve the global debt problem. If the members don't go along, Washington will contribute only enough to support $11 billion in new lending during that period.    U.S. policy makers complain that the bank often grants loans for political reasons rather than on economic merits. They also contend that the bank's largely Latin staff isn't tough enough about compelling borrowing countries to correct deficiencies in their economic policies.    For the bank to assume a larger role in resolving the debt problem, U.S. critics say, it will have to become more like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, which usually insist that borrowing countries take specific steps to overhaul their economies before granting them new loans.    According to U.S. officials, the IADB's inadequacies stem from one basic flaw in the bank's charter: the borrowing countries themselves control the distribution of funds. Unlike other international lending organizations, where weighted voting systems give the contributing countries a clear majority, the Inter-American Development Bank assigns 54% of its voting power to Latin countries. The U.S. has another 34.5% and the rest is split among 15 other donor countries.    As it currently takes at least a 50% vote to halt an IADB loan, the Latin countries can guarantee approval simply by voting as a bloc. Washington wants to change the bank's rules so that loans could be turned down by just a 35% no vote. That way, the U.S., joined by any other industrial country, could veto loans it finds objectionable.    IADB staffers dispute criticisms that the organization is too lax, contending that Washington shouldn't try to force all other countries to follow the U.S.'s own economic model. &quot;There are many ways to development, not just the one that's in use here in the U.S.,&quot; says one official of the Washington-based organization.    Still, U.S. and Latin American negotiators have made substantial progress toward resolving their differences. The Latin Americans have agreed over the past several months to a spate of U.S. demands -- to earmark 25% of the bank's loans to help countries restructure their economies, rather than for specific projects such as dams and roads; to channel a larger share of the total to the four big debtors, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela; to tie project loans to long-range economic restructuring programs; and to develop new procedures to coordinate the bank's loans with those of the World Bank.    But the dispute over veto power has proved more thorny. Latin governments, loathe to give up an historic prerogative, are willing to reduce the veto threshhold to 40% of the vote, but they say it would cost them too much politically to accede to the full U.S. demand.    Most are under pressure at home to be more aggressive in standing up to the U.S. on economic and financial issues. Brazil's recent move to suspend interest payments on commercial bank loans has only revived regional pressures to defy creditors.    Moreover, other donor governments aren't supporting Washington's veto demand. Only Canada has offered even lukewarm backing.    Following lower-level negotiations tonight and tomorrow morning, Treasury Secretary James Baker is scheduled to address the bank's annual meeting, which begins formally on Monday. Treasury officials say Mr. Baker is likely to reiterate the U.S. position.    Both sides are running out of time to resolve the dispute. The bank is about to exhaust its current four-year operating budget and will need more funds. U.S. negotiators say the Reagan administration will have to decide within a few weeks how much Washington actually plans to contribute to the organization's support. &quot;We're down to brinksmanship,&quot; a U.S. negotiator says. </TEXT></DOC>
