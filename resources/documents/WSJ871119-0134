DorfmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)PUBLISHING (PUB) </IN><TEXT>   Like sleepy watchdogs, most widely read investment newsletters didn't give investors much help before last month's stock market crash.    To be sure, a few newsletters did warn subscribers to get out of the market, partially or totally, before the roof fell in Oct. 19. But a sampling of major letters shows that most gave either equivocal warnings or none at all.    &quot;You get caught up in this thing and you don't want it to end,&quot; says Yale Hirsch, a veteran market follower who writes the Smart Money newsletter. Mr. Hirsch warned his subscribers before the crash that he thought blue-chip stocks &quot;have had it.&quot; But he stayed bullish on secondary stocks, which got hit just as hard in the October collapse.    &quot;I wish I could have had the foresight to get everybody out of everything,&quot; says Mr. Hirsch now. But &quot;we don't get the opportunity to go back and re-edit.&quot;    A fortunate few don't need to. &quot;I've got a stack of letters here, people saying, 'You saved my life,'&quot; exults Stan Weinstein, writer of the Professional Tape Reader.    In his issue dated Oct. 16, Mr. Weinstein wrote of &quot;the first bit of panic in the air&quot; and said, &quot;Caution makes a whole lot more sense than does bargain hunting.&quot; He advised subscribers to put about three-quarters of their portfolios into cash. Callers to his telephone hotline were urged on Oct. 17 and 18 to go 88% into cash.    But many newsletter writers are eating crow. &quot;There were lots of little red flags that I didn't pay enough attention to,&quot; says Al Frank, who writes the Prudent Speculator. &quot;I'm really disgusted with myself.&quot;    One such sign, he says, was that the ratio of new highs to new lows on individual stocks was declining even while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was setting records in August. Mr. Frank went into the crash urging investors to keep 95% of their investment funds in the stock market.    &quot;We were looking for a little rain and got a hurricane,&quot; says Stephen Leeb, who expected the industrial average to range between 2300 and 2750 during the fall. Mr. Leeb, publisher of several investment newsletters, acquired Indicator Digest shortly before the crash and merged his Investment Strategist letter into it. Both letters were giving essentially the same advice before the crash: Sit tight.    Even in retrospect, Mr. Leeb says, &quot;The signs of a crash were simply not there.&quot; He notes that low-priced stocks usually become popular and actively traded before market tops; that didn't happen this time. His conclusion: &quot;You really can't protect yourself against something that happens once or twice a century.&quot;    Robert Nurock, who writes the Astute Investor, stayed bullish right up to the crash. Today he says simply, &quot;I was wrong.&quot;    Like Mr. Leeb, Mr. Nurock says the market collapsed without the typical warning signals: rampant speculation and investor euphoria. Still, he now feels that the persistent weakness in bonds was a warning he should have heeded.    Many letter writers weren't strongly bullish or bearish in the weeks before the crash. They hedged their bets. For example, Dow Theory Forecasts, a weekly letter published in Hammond, Ind., was advising readers to be &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;selective.&quot; But it didn't define those terms.    &quot;Our clients did do some selling&quot; before the crash, says Richard Evans, the newsletter's president. He points out that in early September his letter advised &quot;selective profit-taking on rallies.&quot;    Similarly, Outlook, published by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., was recommending &quot;caution&quot; but not outright selling. &quot;We told people that storm clouds were forming, but we didn't tell them to get indoors,&quot; says editor Arnold Kaufman.    Outlook did warn that stocks appeared overvalued and recommended some hedging strategies, but it never suggested selling stocks. In the future, Mr. Kaufman says, he will advise investors to raise cash if he sees stock prices at levels that are as high, compared with underlying values, as they were for much of 1987.    Charles Allmon, writer of Growth Stock Outlook, didn't wait too long to get out of the market -- but some say he exited too early, turning bearish in late 1986. In his last pre-crash issue, Mr. Allmon wrote that virtually everyone was expecting &quot;a painless correction of 10-15%,&quot; but that 1987 might be &quot;the big double-cross, carrying 90% of all investors over the cliff.&quot;    Mark Hulbert, who tracks the performance of about 100 newsletters in his publication Hulbert Financial Digest, calculates that Mr. Allmon -- so far at least -- has cost his subscribers more in foregone gains than he saved them in prevented losses.    Mr. Allmon objects. &quot;I didn't miss a thing,&quot; he declares. &quot;We haven't seen the bottom of this cycle.&quot; He expects a temporary rally, then a bear market that drags on into 1988 or 1989.    Some newsletter writers, faced with the recent unpleasantness, prefer to call attention to past triumphs.    Value Line Investment Survey, one of the most widely followed of all newsletters, urged in its last pre-crash issue that subscribers stay fully invested. With what proved to be prophetic understatement, Value Line observed, &quot;Trying to time market turns is a tricky business and can easily produce unfavorable results if one guesses wrong.&quot;    Mark Tavel, a senior economist with Value Line, says that the service has recommended a fully invested posture almost continuously for the past 13 years, and that its followers are &quot;very much richer than they were several years ago.&quot;    &quot;We've never made a substantial effort at timing the market,&quot; Mr. Tavel says. &quot;Catching market swings is not an easy game to play. I would have used the word 'impossible' if it weren't so self-serving.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
