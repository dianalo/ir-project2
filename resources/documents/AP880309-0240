Israeli officials have fought to keep the resignations fromtaking place, warning those who quit they won't get severence payand telling community leaders they may lose basic services.   The resignations threaten to add to the financial burden ofoccupation and deprive Israel of a potent symbol of cooperation andcoexistence.   ``You can't go against 600,000 people in Gaza,'' said Eid AkramSharif, former head of the income tax department who led all 40employes in a mass resignation.   Sharif, a plump, well-dressed man who nervously twirled his carkeys as he spoke, drew nods of agreement from a half-dozen otherex-taxmen.   They sat on chairs in a semi-circle on a dirt street in therelatively well-to-do Ramali quarter. Children on the cornererected a barricade. Graffiti on a wall nearby declared the taxmento be ``honorable brothers.''   ``Before we were collaborators. Now, we are nationalists,'' saidSharif.   But the taxmen were less than enthusiastic about their new rolesas heroes of the three-month uprising. They felt trapped betweenthe threats of Arab militants and the pressure from Israeliauthorities who refused to accept the resignations.   One of the resigned taxmen said Israeli authorities warned himnot to speak with the press or Palestinian activists, saying theycould get up to six months in jail for inciting violence.   Hafez Al Borno, a gray-haired man in his mid-40s, later drove areporter downtown to point out a wall where graffiti demanded thetax department's resignation on Palestinian Flag Day.   ``Arab employes of the income tax and value-added tax departmentmust resign otherwise we will _'' said the graffiti, whichominously left unsaid what the punishment would be.   As part of their three-month strike, Palestinians in Gaza andthe West Bank have refused to pay taxes. Israeli authoritiesdecline to give figures on the non-payment.   Israel imposed new rules last month on the occupied territoriesas a way to pressure the Palestinians to end the activism. Theyrequire Palestinians to prove they paid their taxes before they cantravel abroad or import or export goods. They must also registerwhen they bring $1,000 or more into the country. The previous limitwas $5,000.   ``The striking groups will have no mercy on anyone paying taxes.This money funds the occupation and is a tool of oppression,'' saida leaflet circulating in the West Bank last week.   New graffiti targeted police officers as the next to be calledon to abandon their posts. ``Yes to the resignation of police,''one said.   In a chilling warning this week in the West Bank city ofJericho, an Arab policeman suspected of collaborating was stabbedto death. His body was wrapped in a Palestinian flag and left onhis mother's doorstep.   In response to the PLO campaign, a group of West Bank policeofficers issued a statement stressing they were not involved insuppressing the riots.   Lt. Mustafa Adawi, spokesman for the group, was quoted by thedaily Al Quds newspaper as saying before the killing that policelimited their jobs to fighting ordinary crime and directing traffic.   ``It is not their business to arrest protesters, preventdemonstration or inform on those who participate,'' he said.``Policemen are an integral part of the Palestinian people andshare their political aspirations for the future.''   Palestinians claim that more than 20 of the estimated 300 policein Gaza already have resigned.   Shmuel Goren, government coordinator for the occupiedterritories, said the civil administration had 18,000 employes,about 11,000 of them teachers who were exempted from the strikecall.   ``We are today witnessing brutal PLO threats against publicofficials and notables in the territories,'' Goren was quoted asaying by the daily Al Hamishmar.   A Goren aide warned that life would only become more difficultfor the 1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip ifIsrael had to assume the whole burden of administering the areas.   ``Public services will be damaged if they are to resign, and theonly ones to suffer from these resignations, if they occur, will bethe Palestinians themselves,'' he said.   The government provides electricity, water, road maintenance,garbage collection, health care and education.   Countering Palestinian claims that Israel profited financiallyfrom the occupation, a former military administrator said $160million was in taxes was collected from the West Bank last year andall of it was poured back into services for the 850,000 Arabresidents. Figures for Gaza were not available.   The ex-official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidanother $24 million in income and sales taxes was collected fromthe 110,000 Palestinians working in Israel and went to Israel'streasury.   Leaflets last week called for collaborators to go to mosques anddeclare their repentence and for employees of Israeli-appointedmunicipal councils to resign.   In an apparent effort to win good will, the municipalauthorities in the West Bank towns of Jenin and Al Bireh took outadvertisements in newspapers to announce a 25 percent reduction for1988-89 in property taxes and Al Bireh said it was eliminating cityfees.</TEXT></DOC>
