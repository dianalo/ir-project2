The late 1960's and the 1970's saw a sizeable reduction inthe production of yellowcake because of an earlier over-supply, a levelingoff of the military demand, and a failure of the nuclear electric powerindustry to create the anticipated commercial demand. The decline inthe domestic production of yellowcake has continued through the early1980's to the present. Today, there are five operating uranium millsin the US: one in Wyoming, two in Utah, one in New Mexico, and one inTexas. Of these five mills, three are operating on a reduced schedule,as little as three days a month. A significant portion of the currentUS production of uranium goes overseas to fulfill Japanese, French, andother European contracts. There is still a sizeable reclamation job tobe accomplished on old uranium wastes, both tailings impoundments andoverburden embankments. Before the Uranium Mill Tailings Control Actof 1978 (PL 95-604), reclamation was frequently omitted altogether, orelse done in a haphazard fashion. We do not know the total area of unreclaimed,radioactive, uranium overburden wastes in the western US, but the areais large, probably several thousand hectares. Fortunately, these overburdenwastes are almost entirely located in remote areas. Mill tailings aremore difficult to reclaim than overburden, and tailings represent a moreserious health hazards. There are approximately 25 million metric tonsof unreclaimed uranium mill tailings, with variable health hazards, locatedin the US.</TEXT></DOC>
