Analysis and experiments were conductedto describe the effects of the leg-surface heat loss, and the temperaturedifference on the performance of a thermoelectric generator. Two numericalmodels that treat the problem of thermoelectric generator, linear andnonlinear were developed. A Global Corporation model 5120, 120-watt thermoelectricgenerator system was tested in the 5-kW NMSU/PSL solar furnace at twodifferent hot and cold junction temperatures. The developed computermodels were used for design and simulation of an auto thermoelectricgenerator (Automobile Thermoelectric Generator) that converts waste heatfrom the car engine directly to the electrical power as a substitutedevice for the electrical generator used in cars.</TEXT></DOC>
