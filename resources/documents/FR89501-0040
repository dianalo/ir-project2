The FMPs were developed by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council(Council) under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and ManagementAct (Magnuson Act). The Gulf FMP is implemented by regulations appearingat 50 CFR 611.92 and Part 672 and the Bering FMP by regulations appearingat 50 CFR 611.93 and Part 675.The Council approved Amendments 17 and 12 to the Gulf and Bering FMPs respectivelyfor submission to the Secretary of Commerce at the June 21-24, 1988 meetingof the Council. The Secretary received Amendments 17 and 12 on August 7,1988, and immediately began a review of them to determine their consistencywith the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. The Director, Alaska Region,NMFS (Regional Director), determined that both amendments were consistentwith the Magnuson Act and other applicable law and approved Amendments17 and 12 on November 10, 1988, under his delegated authority to approvefishery management plans and plan amendments submitted by the Council.A notice of availability of Amendments 17 and 12 was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 11, 1988 (53 FR 30322) and proposedimplementing regulations were published on September 6, 1988 at 53 FR 34322(correction at 53 FR 36696; September 21, 1988). Both notices invited publicreview and comment on the amendment and proposed rule through October 21,1988. Three letters of public comment were received and considered in developingthis final rule. A summary of, and response to, all comments received isgiven below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Description</ITAG>A description of, and reasons for, each part of Amendments 17 and 12 aregiven in the preamble of the proposed rule. A summary follows of what isaccomplished by this rule which implements Amendments 17 and 12.1. Revised Federal Reporting Requirements (Pertaining to the Gulf and BeringFMPs)The purpose of Amendment 17 to the Gulf FMP and this part of Amendment12 to the Bering FMP is to assure that records of groundfish catches fromthe Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area(BSAI area) are received at frequent enough intervals to provide fisherymanagers with accurate information on harvest rates. A delay of harvestdata could result in exceeding catch limits or delay in reapportionmentof groundfish that are surplus to the needs of domestic processors.In 1986, a problem of delayed harvest data emerged within the domesticannual processing (DAP) sector of the groundfish industry. This sectorincludes domestic fishing vessels that process their catch on board ordeliver it to domestic processors. At that time, the only source of DAPcatch data was fish ticket reports required of fishermen within one weekof sale or delivery of their catch to shore. However, DAP vessels suchas catcher/processor and mothership/processor vessels normally stay atsea for lengthy periods of time. Because they did not report their catchesuntil fish ticket submission was required, the flow of harvest data wasdelayed significantly.This problem was partly resolved in 1987 when the weekly catch/receiptreport requirement (andSection;andSection; 672.5(a)(3) and 675.5(a)(3)) wasimposed on catcher/processor and mothership/processor vessels operatingin the EEZ (52 FR 8592, March 19, 1987). The part that remained unresolvedpertained to vessels that were not operating in the EEZ. For example, aU.S. processing vessel operating only in waters of the State of Alaskabut receiving groundfish caught in the EEZ would not be required to submitweekly catch/receipt reports. The reason for this is that the weekly reportingrequirement was imposed only on vessels to which a Federal fishing permithad been issued. Vessels operating outside of the EEZ off Alaska were notrequired to have a Federal permit.A management measure proposed in Amendments 17 and 12 would have closedthis unintended reporting loophole by revising andSection;andSection; 672.4(a)and 675.4(a) to extend the permit requirement to vessels receiving fishthat were caught or harvested in the EEZ off Alaska. Subsequent to publicationof the proposed rule, however, NOAA reviewed the requirement in light ofthe permit provision of the Magnuson Act (section 303(b)(1)), which appliesonly to fishing vessels fishing in the EEZ.NOAA found no need to disapprove the proposed management measure, however.The need to gather groundfish harvesting and processing data necessaryfor effective conservation and management of EEZ fishery resources wasapparent. The final rule differs from the proposed rule by extending existingreporting requirements rather than permit requirements. Under this extension,mothership/processors that operate outside of the EEZ and process groundfishharvested from the EEZ are required to comply with existing catcher/processor-mothership/processorreporting requirements under andSection;andSection; 672.5(a)(3) and 675.5(a)(3).To effect this change from the proposed rule, some language in the (a)(3)paragraphs of andSection;andSection; 672.5 and 675.5 has been changed. Forexample, the word ``area'' in these paragraphs is clarified as ``statisticalarea'' and this term is defined in andSection;andSection; 672.2 and 675.2,respectively. Other minor changes improve clarity and specificity of therequired information. No new information is required that substantiallychanges the reporting burden previously estimated in the proposed rule.The principal and intended effect of requiring weekly receipt and producttransfer reports from motherships processing groundfish caught in the EEZremains unchanged from the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Specific Changes From the Proposed Rule in the Final Rule</ITAG>The changes to andSection;andSection; 672.4 and 675.4 in the proposed ruleare deleted from the final rule since the domestic permit provision ofthe Magnuson Act (section 303(b)(1)) only applies to vessels fishing inthe EEZ.Under andSection;andSection; 672.5 and 675.5, paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(3)(i)have been revised to delete reference to permits and to include all processorvessels receiving fish caught in the EEZ. Also, under andSection;andSection;672.5 and 675.5, paragraphs (a)(3) (ii) and (iii) are removed to eliminateredundancy with (a)(3)(i); and paragraphs (a)(3)(iv) and (a)(3)(v) areredesignated as (a)(3) (ii) and (iii), respectively.Under andSection;andSection; 672.5 and 675.5, new paragraph (a)(3)(ii) hasbeen changed as follows: paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) is new regulatory textwhich lists information currently required in the catch/receipt and producttransfer report; new paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) is old paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A),new paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) is old paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B), new paragraph(a)(3)(ii)(D) is old paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(C); new paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(E)is further clarification of content in (a)(3)(ii); new paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(F)is old paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(D); new paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(G) is old paragraph(a)(3)(iv)(E); new paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(H) is old paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(F)with the word ``statistical'' added before the word ``area''; new paragraph(a)(3)(ii)(I) is old paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(G); and new paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(J)is old paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(H).2. PSC Limits for Groundfish Species Applicable to JVP and Foreign Fisheries(Pertaining to the Bering FMP)This part of Amendment 12 to the Bering FMP establishes a procedure similarto that in the Gulf FMP whereby the Secretary, in consultation with theCouncil, can annually specify PSC limits for groundfish species that arefully apportioned to domestic fisheries. Such PSC limits will apply toJVP and foreign fisheries. The purpose of this management measure is toresolve two problems.The first problem concerns the biological conservation of the BSAI groundfishresource. The harvest limit, or total allowable catch (TAC) for each species,is the primary control preventing excessive fishing mortality and ultimatelyoverfishing. When the Regional Director determines that the amount of TACof any target species or of the ``other species'' category remaining duringthe fishing year is necessary for bycatch in either groundfish fishery,andSection; 675.20(a)(7) requires the Secretary to prohibit further directedfishing for that species. However, when the catch of a species reachesits TAC, any further bycatches of it may not be retained and must be treatedin the same manner as a prohibited species. Although the resulting discardof further bycatches of this species contributes to its total fishing mortality,the amount of additional fishing mortality from this source is not countedagainst or controlled by any quota or limit, and further catches are restrainedonly when fishing mortality will result in overfishing.In earlier years, fishing mortality resulting from bycatch discard wasan insignificant part of the total fishing mortality for any groundfishspecies. This would remain true if directed fishing for, and retainablebycatches of, most groundfish species continued for all or most of thefishing year. The character of Bering Sea groundfish fisheries is rapidlychanging, however, with persistent increase in domestic fishing effort.This increasing fishing effort is translating into shorter periods of allowabledirected fishing for key high-valued species. Decreased time for directedfishing on a species means increased time during which it will be caughtas a bycatch before and after its TAC is reached. The resulting increasein bycatch discard is becoming a significant portion of the total fishingmortality for many groundfish species. If it remains unlimited, the bycatchdiscard rate could lead to excessive fishing mortality and increase therisk of overfishing.The second problem concerns management of allocations among domestic andforeign fisheries. Currently, any allocation of groundfish to foreign directedfishing must also include an allocation of species that are taken as bycatch.Current regulations do not allow a foreign fishery to retain or discardbycatches of groundfish without accounting for such catches against anallocation for each species caught. The TACs of most bycatch species, however,can be fully harvested by domestic (DAP and JVP) fisheries, leaving noopportunity for allocation of these species to foreign fisheries which,under the Magnuson Act, may be allocated only amounts of the TAC that issurplus to domestic fishery needs. Therefore, if a directed foreign fisherycould not avoid incidental harvest of one or more groundfish species whichwere expected to be fully harvested by domestic fisheries, then these speciescould not, under the current regulations, be allocated to the foreign fisheryin any way; consequently, the foreign fishery would be foreclosed frompursuing its directed fishing allocation. In approving and implementingthis part of Amendment 12, the Secretary concurs with the Council's recommendedpolicy that a foreign nation should not necessarily forego a specifiedallocation of a target species due to the lack of an allocation of bycatchspecies.A similar problem exists with respect to specification of groundfish forJVP. The processor preference amendments to the Magnuson Act provide forDAP priority access to allowable harvests of groundfish. This has beeninterpreted to mean that the specified DAP for any species is not a limiton DAP harvests if there is an unharvested amount of that species specifiedfor JVP. The practical effect of this is similar to the foreign fishingproblem in that specified amounts of a species necessary for JVP bycatchesmay be taken instead by DAP fisheries. Unlike the foreign fisheries, however,this event does not cause the elimination of JVP directed fishing, butit does require the discard of the JVP bycatch species for which the specifiedJVP apportionment has been, or will be, fully harvested by DAP fishermen.This rule resolves these two conservation and management problems by (1)providing for a specific PSC limit on non-retainable catches in the sameway that the TAC for a species limits retainable catches, and (2) providingforeign and JVP fisheries with groundfish PSC limits that are outside ofthe TAC and optimum yield (OY) thereby providing assurance that a specifiedPSC limit will be available for non-retainable bycatch purposes only, regardlessof DAP priority to allocations of retainable groundfish. Groundfish catchesby foreign and JVP fisheries will be counted against their respective PSClimits only after their retainable catch limits, if any, have been taken.All foreign or JVP fishing likely to take significant amounts of a prohibitedgroundfish species would cease when that species' PSC limit is reached,unless the limit is increased by the Secretary under inseason adjustmentauthority.3. Rock Sole as a Distinct Target Species (Pertaining to the Bering FMP).Under this management measure, the list of species in Table 1 of 50 CFRPart 675 would be expanded to include rock sole as a distinct target species.This species currently is part of the ``other flatfish'' category whichincludes eight other species. Grouping these species into one target speciescategory was done originally because there was little commercial interestin any one species of this group and their distribution was highly intermixed.Species of the ``other flatfish'' category most commonly are taken as bycatchin directed fisheries for yellowfin sole. In recent years, however, a marketfor roe-bearing rock sole has developed in Japan. Accordingly, fishermenhave developed an ability to target on this species.The intent of this action is to accommodate the new commercial interestand targeting ability by providing for separate accounting of catch andstock abundance information. The regulatory effect of this action for fishermenwould be an additional species for which catch reports would be required,and for the Council, an additional species for which TAC, DAP, JVP, TALFF,and PSC limits would be annually specified. The additional reporting requirementfor fishermen is expected to be a negligible additional burden since itinvolves writing one additional number on weekly reporting and fish ticketforms and because catch amounts of individual species probably are recordedanyway for business purposes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Received</ITAG>Three letters of comment on the proposed rule were received prior to theend of the comment period on October 21, 1988. The three commenters hadsimilar comments, all of which related to the proposed groundfish PSC limits.These comments are summarized and responded to below.<T3>Comment 1: </T3>The term ``minimum'' in the proposed language regardingthe preseason establishment of PSC limits and the inseason adjustment ofPSC limits is unclear. It should be modified by criteria such as thosein regulations implementing the Gulf FMP at andSection;andSection;672.20(b)(2)(i) and (ii).<T3>Response: </T3>Incidental catches (bycatches) of species in the BSAIgroundfish fisheries, regardless of whether they are prohibited, are highlyvariable. The bycatch of any particular species over time can be describedin terms of a range of bycatch rates. Various factors such as the timeof year, depth of fishing, area of fishing, and gear selectivity, willaffect the actual rate of bycatch of a species that will occur. AlthoughNOAA recognizes the highly variable nature of bycatches, it is incumbenton fishermen to maintain their bycatches of prohibited species as low aspossible. The term ``minimum amount necessary,'' in this case, means justthis: The least amount absolutely necessary for prosecuting an allowabletarget fishery.The determination of this minimum will be a matter of judgment on the partof the Council and the Regional Director guided by the Magnuson Act principleof being based on the best available scientific information and the socio-economicobjectives of the Bering FMP. NOAA notes that it is a priority objectiveof the Bering FMP to ``minimize the impact of groundfish fisheries on prohibitedspecies'' (Section 14.1) and that this objective takes precedence overthe objective to ``provide for the opportunity and orderly developmentof domestic groundfish fisheries.'' Therefore, the ``minimum'' languagein the proposed rule is consistent with the Magnuson Act and the BeringFMP without further specification of qualifying criteria.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>The proposed rule sets up an annual confrontation withinthe Council in the setting of PSC limits. It is likely that politics willinfluence this process and PSC limits probably will not be based solelyon the best scientific information.<T3>Response: </T3>It is a purpose of the Magnuson Act to allow all interestedpersons to participate in the decision-making process of fishery managementthrough the regional fishery management councils. The Secretary will assurethat the PSC limits are consistent with the Magnuson Act, the Bering FMP,and other applicable law. The Secretary is not obligated to accept theCouncil's recommended PSC limits if they are otherwise.<T3>Comment 3: </T3>The proposed rule is not supported by an economic analysisof losses and gains.<T3>Response: </T3>A combined environmental assessment/regulatory impactreview/initial regulatory flexibility analysis (EA/RIR/IRFA) of the managementmeasures proposed by Amendments 12 and 17 was prepared by the Council andsubmitted to the Secretary for review and approval. As earlier explainedin andSection; 3.4 of this document, it is impossible to precisely predictthe behavior of the groundfish fisheries in the BSAI area with respectto bycatches due to the highly variable nature of bycatches and economicfactors affecting the incentive to fish for certain species at differenttimes and places. Therefore, the Council performed a qualitative analysisthat outlined the basic types of costs and benefits that could be expectedfrom the proposed rule. NOAA finds that this analysis satisfies the economicanalytical requirements of Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory FlexibilityAct.<T3>Comment 4:</T3> The preseason setting of PSC limits is discretionary.What criteria will the Secretary use to determine if a PSC limit shouldbe established, and will they be fair to all users of the resource?<T3>Response:</T3> Preseason specification of PSC limits will be governedby the relative amounts of groundfish apportioned to JVP fisheries in theproposed and final initial specifications notice required under andSection;675.20(a)(6),which provides for public comment. To the extent that the implementationof PSC limits has allocative effects, the Secretary is guided by nationalstandard four of the Magnuson Act, which requires such allocation of fishingprivileges to be fair and equitable, and reasonably calculated to promoteconservation.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> The Secretary should have to demonstrate why a PSClimit should be established. There must be a demonstrated risk of overfishingbefore setting a PSC limit for a species of groundfish; most BSAI groundfishspecies have acceptable biological catches (ABCs) in excess of their TACs.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA agrees that limiting the risk of overfishing isa principal reason for establishing a PSC limit. The ABC of a species isa useful guideline for determining the risk of overfishing, although exceedingthe ABC of any species may not result in overfishing. In making its PSCrecommendations to the Secretary, NOAA expects the Council to considerthe margin between a species' ABC and TAC relative to the likely JVP andforeign bycatch of that species.<T3>Comment 6:</T3> The proposed rule suggests that all JVP fishing stopsif any PSC limit is reached. The target fisheries affected by this ruleshould be defined as narrowly as possible. Also, it is imperative thatany inseason adjustments of PSC limits be done promptly.<T3>Response:</T3> NOAA agrees that only those JVP or foreign fisheriesthat are likely to catch significant amounts of a species for which a PSClimit has been reached should be prohibited. Defining what is meant by``fishery'' or ``significant'' will be possible only in the context ofthe circumstances and conditions prevailing at the time a fishery closureis contemplated. An amount of bycatch mortality may be significant to onespecies but not another. Fishing conditions, season, and location may besome important factors in determining whether bycatches of a species aboveits PSC limit are likely to be significant. Likewise, a fishery may bedefined in terms of its target species, fishing gear used, location, depthor season of fishing. Generally, it is the intent of NOAA to exercise itsauthority to prohibit fishing due to attainment of PSC limits to minimizeany negative effects on commercial fisheries consistent with the purposeof this rule.<T3>Comment 7:</T3> It may be necessary to create PSC limits for a speciesby decreasing its TAC so that its TAC plus its PSC does not exceed itsABC. This can have the same practical effect as stopping a fishery shortof harvesting its target species quota, or premature closure. This resultsin potential revenue loss to the fishery and a failure to achieve OY asrequired by the Magnuson Act. This could occur even when overfishing isnot an issue if PSC limits become too dogmatically enforced. The extentand timeliness of the use of discretionary authority are key to meetingthe twin goals of not exceeding a PSC limit while still achieving OY.<T3>Response:</T3> The prevention of overfishing is a fundamental tenetof the Magnuson Act. The achievement of the OY or TAC, in the case of theBering FMP, of a species depends on the condition that it, or any otherspecies, will not become overfished. A principal purpose of the proposedrule is to prevent overfishing of a species of groundfish resulting fromits bycatch in a fishery for a different species. The rule to establishPSC limits for groundfish provides the Secretary an appropriate balancebetween exercising discretion based on the best available information atthe time and mandating the closure of fisheries due to attainment of aPSC limit and to prevent overfishing. The Secretary exercises discretionaryjudgment first in the establishment of PSC limits, again in the potentialadjustment of them due to reapportionments of target species, and finally,when a PSC limits is reached, in deciding whether and which JVP or foreignfishing is likely to catch significant amounts of the species for whichthe PSC limit is attained. In addition, the Secretary has existing inseasonauthority to adjust a PSC limit that is found to be incorrectly specifiedbased on the best available scientific information relating to the biologicalstock status of the species in question. Balancing this discretionary authorityare certain procedural requirements to assure that decisions are well foundedon factual information, that the interests of all resource users are considered,and that overfishing will not occur.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Regional Director has determined that Bering FMP Amendment 12 and GulfFMP Amendment 17 are necessary for the conservation and management of theBSAI area and Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries, respectively, and thatthese amendments are consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicablelaw.The Council prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for these amendments.The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries concluded that there will beno significant impact on the environment as a result of this rule. A copyof the EA may be obtained from the Council at the address above.The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA (Under Secretary) determinedthat this rule is not a ``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysisunder Executive Order 12291. This determination is based on the EA/RIR/FRFAprepared by the Council. A copy of the EA/RIR/FRFA may be obtained fromthe Council at the address above.The EA/RIR/FRFA prepared by the Council describes the effects this rulewill have on small entities. The analysis contained in this final documentis largely the same as that continued in the (initial) EA/RIR/IRFA whichwas summarized for each of the management measures in the proposed rule.The Under Secretary concludes that this rule will have significant effectson small entities. These effects have been discussed in the EA/RIR/FRFA,a copy of which may be obtained from the Council at the address above.This rule contains collection of information requirements subject to thePaperwork Reduction Act. The collection of information requirements havebeen given approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) underOMB Control Number 0648-0213.The regulatory changes of Amendments 12 and 17 to the Bering Sea and GulfFMPs, respectively, clarify the intent of the existing collection of informationrequirements by requiring reports from catcher/processor and mothership/processorvessels if they use groundfish caught within the EEZ adjacent to Alaska,regardless of whether the vessels are inside or outside of the EEZ whenreceiving the fish. The original regulations required reports only fromvessels with Federal permits, overlooking the potential for groundfishbeing taken to vessels outside the EEZ which are not required to obtainsuch permits.Since the original request for OMB approval included these additional vesselsin its burden estimates, and neither the justification for obtaining informationon groundfish from the EEZ or the contents of the reports have changed(except for minor clarifications), the amendments do not contain substantiveor material modifications to the collections of information approved byOMB.Public reporting burden for these collections of information is estimatedto average 23 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of these collections,including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Steven Pennoyer, AlaskaRegional Director, National Marine Fisheries Service, P.O. Box 1668, Juneau,Alaska 99802; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork ReductionProject (0648-0213), Washington, DC 20503.The Council determined that this rule will be implemented in a manner thatis consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the approved coastalzone management program of Alaska. This determination was submitted forreview by the responsible State agencies under section 307 of the CoastalZone Management Act. The State agencies failed to comment within the statutorytime period.This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>50 CFR Part 611 Fisheries, Foreign fishing. 50 CFR Parts 672 and 675 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 21, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.

Section 675.20 is amended by revising the heading of paragraph (a);by redesignating paragraphs (a)(6), (a)(7), (a)(8), (a)(9) and (a)(10)as paragraphs (a)(7), (a)(8), (a)(9), (a)(10) and (a)(12) respectively;by revising new paragraphs (a)(10) and (a)(12); by adding new paragraphs(a)(6), (a)(11) and (b)(l)(iv); and by revising paragraph (b)(2) to readas follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 675.20</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General limitations.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Harvest limits.</T3><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(6) <T3>Prohibited species catch (PSC) limits. </T3>When the Secretary determines,after consultation with the Council, that the TAC for any species or speciesgroup in any fishing year will be harvested by fishing vessels of the UnitedStates, the Secretary may specify PSC limits for that species or speciesgroup applicable to JVP and TALFF fisheries. Species for which a PSC limithas been specified under this paragraph shall be treated in the same manneras prohibited species under paragraph (c) of this section. Any PSC limitspecified under this paragraph may not exceed an amount determined by theRegional Director to be the minimum amount necessary to harvest a groundfishspecies or species group for which there is a JVP or TALFF apportionmentand which will not result in overfishing of the species for which the PSClimit is specified. The Regional Director will account for the JVP or TALFFcatch of a species against an applicable PSC limit after any retainableJVP or TALFF amounts of that species have been taken and notice has beengiven under paragraph (a)(9) of this section that the JVP or TALFF fisherymust treat that species as a prohibited species.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(10) If the Regional Director determines that directed fishing for groundfishother than the species for which the TAC is achieved, as determined underparagraph (a)(9) of this section, may lead to overfishing of this species,the Secretary will, in the notice required by that paragraph, also limitsuch directed fishing for other groundfish by any method, including areaclosures, gear restrictions, or prohibition of directed fishing, that willprevent overfishing of the species for which the TAC is achieved.(11) When the Regional Director determines that a PSC limit applicableto a JVP or TALFF fishery for a groundfish species has been or will bereached, the Secretary will publish a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> prohibiting any further receipt of domestically-harvestedfish by foreign vessels or TALFF fishing which is likely to catch significantamounts of the species for which the PSC limit has been or will be reachedfor the remainder of the fishing year.(12) When making the determinations specified under paragraphs (a) (8),(9), (10) and (11) of this section, the Regional Director may considerallowing fishing to continue or resume with certain gear types or in certainareas and times based on findings of:(i) The risk of biological harm to groundfish for which the TAC or PSClimit will be or has been achieved;(ii) The risk of socioeconomic harm to authorized users of the groundfishfor which the TAC or PSC limit will be or has been achieved; and(iii) The negative effect of prohibitions or restrictions authorized underparagraphs (a) (8), (9), (10) and (11) of this section on the socioeconomicwell-being of other domestic fisheries.(b) * * *(1) * * *(iv) <T3>Adjustments of PSC limits</T3>. When the Secretary apportions or reapportionsgroundfish under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Secretary may, bynotice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, increase proportionately any applicable PSClimit of a species or species group if such increase will not result inoverfishing of that species or species group. Any adjusted PSC limit maynot exceed the amount determined by the Regional Director to be the minimumamount necessary to harvest the groundfish species or species group affectedby the apportionment or reapportionment.(2) <T3>Procedure</T3>. (i) The Secretary will provide all interested personsan opportunity to comment on the proposed apportionments, retentions orPSC limit adjustments under paragraph (b)(1) of this section before suchapportionments, retentions or adjustments are made, unless he finds thatthere is good cause for not providing a prior comment opportunity, andpublishes the reasons therefore in the notice of apportionment, retentionor adjustment. No apportionment, retention or PSC limit adjustment maytake effect until it has been published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> as a notice with a statement of the findingsupon which the apportionment, retention or adjustment is based. Commentsprovided for in this paragraph must be received by the Secretary not laterthan 5 days before April 1, June 1, and August 1, or other dates that maybe specified. If the Secretary determines for good cause that a noticeof apportionment, retention or PSC limit adjustment must be issued withoutproviding interested persons a prior opportunity for public comment, commentson the apportionment, retention or adjustment will be received for a periodof 15 days after its effective date. The Secretary will consider all timelycomments in deciding whether to make a proposed apportionment, retentionor PSC limit adjustment or to modify an apportionment, retention or adjustmentthat previously has been made, and shall publish responses to those commentsin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> as soon as practicable.(ii) Comments provided for in paragraph (a)(7) and (b)(2)(i) of this sectionshould be addressed to Director, Alaska Region, National Marine FisheriesService, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, Alaska 99802. The Regional Director willmake available to the public during business hours the aggregate data uponwhich any preliminary TAC, DAH, TALFF, or PSC limit figure is based orthe data upon which any apportionment or retention of surplus DAH or reserve,or PSC limit adjustment, was or is proposed to be based at the NationalMarine Fisheries Service Alaska Regional Office, Federal Building, Room453, 709 West Ninth Street, Juneau, Alaska.
