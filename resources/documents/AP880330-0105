George Bush, with the GOP nomination all but in hand, called onRepublicans to ``keep together and get to work.'' Bush wonoverwhelmingly in Connecticut _ as he had been expected to do evenbefore principal rival Bob Dole dropped out of the race on primaryday.   Jackson met privately in Washington with leaders of the partyestablishment, then said afterward, ``In this instance, we bringtogether old wineskins and new wine, but the old wineskins areexpanding and making room for new wine.''   Participants said the meeting was positive all around, with nodiscussion of reports that some Democrats fear nominating Jacksonwould lead to crushing defeat in the general election.   ``We only see that in the press,'' said California AssemblySpeaker Willie Brown, a Jackson supporter. ``Maybe people don'twant to say that in front of us.''   Democrat Albert Gore Jr., who finished a distant third inConnecticut, said today while campaigning in Wisconsin that heexpected no backlash from the comments he made Tuesday about whathe said was Jackson's ``complete and total lack'' of the experienceneeded to be president.   Other candidates have been slow to criticize Jackson, but Goresaid his own comments ``were really not that different from whatI've been saying for several months.''   Dukakis, on NBC-TV, said of the Connecticut primary, ``We wonwith a big, big margin, but it's not the first of my victories.''   ``But this is a marathon and it's going to be all the way to thefinish line. I'm just very pleased that people who know me bestwere so supportive,'' he said.   Jackson, who has beaten Dukakis in two states in the last twoweeks _ Michigan and Illinois _ congratulated the Massachusettsgovernor but suggested geography and campaign finances played a keyrole.   ``You did well with your home field advantage,'' said Jackson,who also appeared on the NBC program.   Sen. Paul Simon, who barely contested Connecticut, made the samepoint Tuesday night. ``We assumed this was Dukakis territory,'' hesaid.   With 100 percent of the Connecticut precincts reporting, Dukakishad 58 percent to Jackson's 28 percent. Gore trailed with 8percent, and Simon had 1 percent.   That restored Dukakis' lead in the national delegate race. Thelatest AP count put Dukakis at 647.55; Jackson at 634.55 anduncommitted at 500.6. Gore had 364.8 and Simon 169.5.   Jackson swept the black vote and won about 20 percent of thewhite vote, according to television network exit polls. His shareof the white vote was put at 5 percent in 1984.   However, primary-day surveys of voters by WNBC-TV in New Yorksuggested only one-fifth of the Democrats believed the nation wasready to elect a black president. ABC found that one-third of theDemocrats would switch to the Republican side if Jackson werenominated.   Only last week Dukakis was suggesting he was the inevitableDemocratic nominee. Now he is saying he expects a long duel withJackson.   ``This is 15 rounds and it's going to be a decision, not aknockout,'' he said Tuesday night. ``It's going all the way to thefinal round.''   Some party heavyweights may have come to the same conclusion.Jackson was meeting in Washington today with the front rank of theDemocratic establishment to discuss issues and policy.   Former party chairman John White, who set up the ``summit,''said it would allow Jackson to talk with Democratic leaders about``the parts of the political world he might not be familiar with.''   Jackson came under fire Tuesday from Gore, in the first seriousattack on him by a Democratic opponent. Gore said Jackson has a``complete and total lack'' of experience needed to be president.   ``We're not choosing a preacher, we're choosing a president,''the Tennessee senator said. Jackson retorted: ``I assume that he isstimulated by his own status in the campaign to attack me.''   The exchange came as the two were in New York, jockeying forposition in New York's delegate-heavy contest on April 19. Gore wasin Wisconsin today, making an early-morning visit to a dairy farmwhere he was to milk cows and do farm chores.   On the Republican side, Dole's departure left Bush with only anominal opponent _ former television evangelist Pat Robertson, whoacknowledged, ``It seems obvious now that George Bush will be thewinner.''   As the Kansas senator bowed out Tuesday, he put aside hisdifferences with the vice president.   ``I return to the Senate as the Republican leader ... ready todo all I can to elect Republicans in November and doing all I canfor our nominee, George Bush,'' he said. Bush beat Dole by alopsided 71-20 margin in Connecticut.   If Dole's delegates _ now in the uncommitted column _ go toBush, the vice president is likely to clinch the delegates neededto nominate in the next few weeks.   With the Republican nomination a nearly done deal, Republicanswere holding the first of three platform hearings today, this oneon foreign policy and defense. GOP chairman Frank Fahrenkopf andthe president's daughter, Maureen Reagan, were among thoseattending.   Rep. Richard Gephardt, who dropped out of the Democratic race onMonday, filed Tuesday for re-election to his House seat fromMissouri, saying he was somewhat relieved to have life return to amore usual pace.   ``Now we can go to the drug store and the movies and be fairlynormal,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
