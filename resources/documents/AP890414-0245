U.S. District Judge Harry MacLaughlin issued a temporaryrestraining order Thursday preventing Davis' Colorado partnershipfrom ``disrupting'' current contracts or contract negotiations atthe nation's fourth-largest airline. Most important to Northwestare its ongoing negotiations with the 5,000-member Air Line PilotsAssociation.   The mediated talks are being held to merge the separatecontracts that existed when Northwest acquired Republic Airlines in1986. The former Republic and Northwest pilots' contracts haveexpired.   Kurt Rivard, a securities analyst for Minneapolis-based DainBosworth Inc., said it is important for Northwest to keep thepilots happy. Davis or other suitors could gain leverage in theirtakeover bids by getting the pilots on their side, he said.   ``Whoever ends up owning Northwest, they have to be on goodterms with the pilots and the pilots know that,'' Rivard said.   Davis, who has offered $2.62 billion, or $90 a share, forNorthwest, said MacLaughlin's ruling will not affect him. His bidhas been rejected by NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest, and thereis speculation a higher bid is on its way.   NWA stock closed Thursday at $90.25, down 50 cents.   ``Since all of our past and planned communications with unionrepresentatives are in full compliance with the limitationsoutlined by the judge, today's ruling will not have any effect onour future actions,'' a spokesman for Davis said in a statement.   In its lawsuit, Northwest contended that Davis was violating theRailway Labor Act by seeking information from the unions aboutcontract proposals. Davis says his representatives have contactedthe unions representing 34,000 of Northwest's 38,000 employees, butonly to create an ``open dialogue'' with them.   Edward Glennon, a lawyer for Davis, said all NWA suitors shouldbe allowed to meet with the airline's unions to dispel fears theunions may have about possible new owners. The same principle wasat work when Peter Ueberroth recently met with the unions ofEastern Airlines in a failed bid to buy that carrier, Glennon said.   A dispute arose Thursday between Northwest, based in suburbanEagan, and Davis over the nature of Davis' previous contacts withthe unions. For instance, Glennon denied a statement from aNorthwest staff lawyer that Davis has met in person with unionofficials. MacLaughlin said he would not attempt to settle thedispute.   The temporary restraining order is good for 10 days and could beextended, the judge said.   The ruling is limited to Davis and his associates even thoughthere have been reports that at least two other investment groupsare interested in buying Northwest.   One of the groups identified in newspaper reports is WesrayCapital Corp., a New York investment company founded by former U.S.Treasury Secretary William Simon. The second is a group thatincludes Gary L. Wilson, a Walt Disney executive who leftNorthwest's board in November; Al Checchi, a Los Angelesbusinessman; and Frederick Malek, a former member of the NixonWhite House and campaign adviser to President Bush.   Three phone calls to Wesray Capital went unanswered Thursday anda woman who answered the phone in Checchi's office would notcomment on the report.   Jim Halvorson, a spokesman for the pilots, said Thursday theunion is ``some distance apart'' on key contract issues. He said anegotiating subcommittee has been formed to discuss the possibilityof creating an employee stock ownership plan. Analysts have saidsuch a plan would help Northwest defend itself against a takeoverby putting more stock in friendly hands.   Meanwhile, Northwest is facing lawsuits from dissidentshareholders and Davis that seek to invalidate the company's``poison pill'' anti-takeover plan. A hearing on Davis' lawsuit isscheduled for April 24 in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington,Del., where NWA is incorporated.</TEXT></DOC>
