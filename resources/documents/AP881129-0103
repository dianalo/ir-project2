The results of an investigation by the USDA Office of InspectorGeneral were contained in a report circulated among USDA officials.The findings were reported Tuesday by the Des Moines Register.   The report said testing at meat plants was not done randomly,allowing violators to avoid detection. When chemical contaminationwas found, action was seldom taken to prevent sale of the taintedmeat, the report said.   Federal officials were unable in most cases to trace animals withillegal chemical or pesticide residues to producers and seldom tookfollow-up samples to determine if the violations were continuing,the report said.   The report said ``some adulterated products were allowed to entercommerce.''   Because the department did not consult the EnvironmentalProtection Agency on what residue levels are safe, there is noassurance pesticides are being monitored ``at levels necessary toprotect the public health,'' the report said.   The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service is responsible forensuring that government-inspected meat and poultry are wholesome.   Inspectors are to randomly collect meat and poultry samples atplants, and if high levels of residue are detected, movement of themeat to market is supposed to be controlled and the producers are tobe identified.   The report said the FSIS is hampered by laws that allow testingonly at slaughter plants. It recommended laws allowing testing atproduction and sales sites.   The report said samples were gathered at some plants at routineand predictable times. ``Such trends could allow plants tomanipulate slaughter schedules to prevent detection of known orsuspected violations,'' the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
