Congress.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Experts Propose Strategies for Fighting VirusesandM;While it is enacting tougher laws for fighting viruses, Congress must avoidcreating statutes that restrict access to technology, several experts saidrecently.andM;At a hearing on the need for computer protection laws, Reps.andP;  Tom McMillen(D-Md.) and Wally Herger (R-Calif.) said their anti-virus bills would givefederal prosecutors the legal tools to prosecute hackers and other personswho write destructive computer programs.andM;Testifying before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, bothsaid such laws as the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act do not cover problemscaused by malicious software.andP;  The laws also fail to provide sufficientdeterrents to computer crime, they said.andM;McMillen's proposed Computer Protection Act, H.R.andP;  287, would expand thedefinition of computer crime to cover any wrongful act aimed at rendering acomputer system inoperable and would impose jail terms of up to 15 years.andO;The bill also would allow victims to recover damages.andM;&quot;We need to understand the law enforcement challenge that await us,&quot; McMillensaid.andP;  &quot;The act is an important disincentive for would-be hackers.andP;  Thepotential damage is too great to ignore.&quot;andM;Herger's Virus Eradi action Act, H.R.andP;  55, calls for fines and prisonsentences of up to 10 years for anyone found guilty of inserting informationor commands in a computer with the intent to cause damage or financial loss.andO;The bill also would enable victims to file a civil suit in federal court.andM;&quot;There are some loopholes when it comes to security of programs.andP;  There hasbeen no single successful prosecution,&quot; Herger said.andP;  &quot;My bill states thatanyone who knowingly does damage may be prosecuted regardless of authorizedaccess.andP;  We must establish a tough deterrent to these kinds of offenses.&quot;andM;However, officials from the National Institute of Standards and Technologyquestioned whether more legislation was the best way to fight the virusproblem.andP;  Raymond G. kammer, NIST's acting director, said that despitewidespread publicity, viruses are not the government's primary securitythreat.andP;  He said the growing problem with sabotage software reflects anoverall lack of security management and oversight.andM;In an effort to help agencies combat viruses, NIST has issued severaltechnical guides on dealing with viruses.andP;  NIST also is helping agenciesestablish a network of computer incident response centers that can supplyusers with advice and resources in case of a virus attack, he said.andM;But Kammer urged federal managers to concentrate on improving their basicsecurity programs.andP;  He said the government should not become preoccupied withviruses, and warned agencies against paying for anti-virus products thatprovide minimal protection.andM;&quot;A lot of people's concern is fueied by their unfamiliarity with thetechnology and they are being taken advantage of by those selling products,&quot;Kammer said.andP;  &quot;Modest changes in software can negate the cure produced, andpeople [could] spend a lot of money for something that won't work very well.andO;Awareness and rational actions are needed, panic and snake oil are not.&quot;andM;Industry groups were divided on whether more legislation is needed.andP;  JohnLandry, director of ADAPSO's software industry division, said tightersecurity controls, user education and software vaccines are not enough toguard against viruses.andP;  He recommended the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act beamended to make unauthorized access or computer program tampering illegal.andM;But John L. Pickett, president of the Computer and Business EquipmentManufacturers Assocation, said the government needs to better enforceexisting laws because the proposed legislation might curb the use oftechnology.andM;The FBI and Justice Department need to train investigation to handleelectronic crimes, he said.andP;  He also urged NIST officials to make viruses apriority.andM;Enacting laws that restrict the way people can use computers only confusesthe issue and will not guarantee ethical behavior, he said.andM;&quot;The bills before you would make it a federal crime to implement commands,and that's basic data processing.andP;  We need to be careful and achieve ourobjective,&quot; Pickett said.andM;&quot;We raise this cautionary note because some of the proposals which have beenput forward to close the perceived loopholes have been too broad,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;Proposals aimed at outlawing viruses target the machines and the softwarerather than the criminal intent and effect.&quot;andM;Congress is not expected to act on either bill until the John Morris trial iscompleted.andP;  Morris is the Cornell Univeristy graduate student accused ofimplementing the worm that attacked Internet last year.andM;Rep.andP;  Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), sub-committee chairman, said the trial mayshow how effective the current laws are.andP;  He said he will wait for the trialto end before he endorses specific changes in the computer fraud laws.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
