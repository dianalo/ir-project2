The unexpected move -- which, according to one analyst,turned on a mere $6 million gap between the two sides --undid nine months of work by Equimark Corp., the Pittsburghbank holding company which had planned to acquire NationalBancshares for $116 million. And it reopened for saleNational Bancshares' rich Texas banking franchise.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'm very unhappy about not getting this deal, veryunhappy,&quot; said Alan S. Fellheimer, Equimark's chairman, whosaid he, unlike the FDIC, was willing to accede tobondholders' demands that they be paid more.   &quot;The FDIC has more power now,&quot; he added, &quot;and it's itchingto send a message to the arbs: Don't mess with the FDIC.&quot;   The FDIC's new muscle derives from the 1989 thrift bailoutlaw, which authorizes the agency to seize assets of solventsubsidiaries of a financial institution to help defray thecosts of rescuing insolvent units -- a tactic which, ifupheld by the courts, would deprive holding company creditorsof assets which they might otherwise sell to recoup theirloans.   Analysts say they expect National Bancshares to providethe first major proving ground for the weapon: The FDIC hasrepeatedly threatened the company's bondholders that it woulduse the so-called &quot;cross guarantee&quot; provisions if at least85% of the company's $25 million in outstanding debenturesweren't tendered -- at a 70% discount to face value -- by theApril 26 deadline set forth in the recapitalization plan.   On Friday, National Bancshares announced that only 22% ofthe debentures were tendered, and added that it won't extendthe offer. Shareholders, on the other hand, approved the planby more than two-to-one, the company said.   Alan Whitney, an FDIC spokesman, declined to say what theagency's next move will be, other than to say that it andother regulatory agencies &quot;are proceeding immediately toconsider alternative resolutions to the NBC situation,including contacting qualified prospective acquirers.&quot;   Jay Lustig, an analyst at Drake Capital Securities Inc.,Santa Monica, Calif., blasted the FDIC for failing tocomplete the planned deal with Equimark, calling the agency&quot;inflexible.&quot; Mr. Lustig contended that, had the FDIC agreedto a proposal by creditors to swap the current debentures forsecurities worth 60 cents on the dollar of original debt, thetotal cost of the recapitalization would only have risen by$6 million.   Frank Anderson, an analyst with Stephens Inc., LittleRock, Ark., agreed that the amounts of money involved aresmall, and speculated that the FDIC was mainly interested insending a signal to bondholders. &quot;I don't think the money hasanything to do with it,&quot; he said. &quot;I think the FDIC justdoesn't want to look like a patsy or a pushover in thefuture.&quot;   Meanwhile, some in the industry speculated that therecapitalization failure owed as much to Equimark's problemsat home as it did to recalcitrant bondholders. Buffetted bythe weak commercial real estate market, Equimark lost $15.4million in the first quarter. And the company's weak stockprice scuttled a planned stock offering, meaning the companyhad to resort to such measures as selling its credit cardbusiness to help raise the $116 million.   In composite trading on the New York Stock ExchangeFriday, Equimark's stock closed at $8.125, down 25 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
