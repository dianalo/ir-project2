The purpose of such a regulationwould be to speed the forward collection of checks by requiring payingbanks to accept checks without charging a fee later in the day, thus increasingthe number of checks that can be collected that day. It would give privatesector collecting banks the same rights vis-a-vis paying banks as the FederalReserve Banks now have. <P/>The Board has not yet made a specific proposal to amend its regulationin this regard. Rather, it is merely requesting comment on the idea ofsame-day payment in private sector presentments.

Based inpart on comments received in response to that earlier proposal the Board,in conjunction with the other Federal bank regulatory agencies and thecentral bank governors of the Group of Ten countries, published a revisedcapital proposal in December 1987, which would establish minimum risk-basedcapital standards applicable to commercial banking organizations in twelvemajor industrial countries. <P/>In January 1988, the Board requested public comment on this revisedproposal and, in particular, on how it should be applied to member banksof the Federal Reserve System and to bank holding companies. <P/>The proposed risk-based capital framework consists of a reviseddefinition of capital, a system for assigning assets and off-balance sheetitems to risk categories, and a schedule for establishing minimum risk-basedcapital ratios (7.25 percent by year-end 1990, and 8.0 percent by year-end1992).

Moreover,the major parts of the proposal have been structured to apply generallyonly to bank holding companies with assets of $150 million or more. Consequently,the proposal is not likely to have a significant economic impact on smallerbanking organizations. <P/>On August 3, 1988, the Board approved in principle revisions tothe guidelines, based in part on the comments received on the initial proposal,as well as on additional discussions with the other central bank authorities.In connection with the above determinations, the Board has decided to studyfurther the possible effect of any voting rights offered with a securityon the percentage caps assigned to certain classes of securities withinthe risk-based capital framework. <T4>Michael J.

The proposedregulation also establishes rules to speed the return of unpaid checks.The Board also proposed to amend its existing Regulation J, which governsthe collection of checks by Federal Reserve Banks, to conform to the newregulation. The proposed Regulation CC and the amendments to RegulationJ would apply to all depository institutions, regardless of size, exceptthat small institutions that do not hold transaction accounts would beexempt from the availability, disclosure, and payment of interest requirements.<P/>In a related action (Docket Number R-0621), the Board requestedcomment on new Federal Reserve Bank services to assist institutions incomplying with the new regulations.
