Bush was honoring 121 of the nation's top high school seniors,the 1989 Presidential Scholars, at the White House today, aftermaking a quick journey by helicopter Monday evening to deliver acommencement address at Cheltenham High School in Wyncote, Pa.   There, in a steamy gymnasium packed with 2,500 people, hedelivered a message intended for all 2.5 million seniors graduatingfrom high school this June, not just Cheltenham's 331.   ``We do not have to stand in front of tanks in America, thankGod. But we do have to summon the same courage to confront the evilthat exists in the world,'' said Bush.   He told the Cheltenham graduates they were the heirs to a legacyof American sacrifice, from Bunker Hill to Bastogne, ``where weupheld the tenets of democracy,'' and from the Red Cross to thePeace Corps.   ``Today I ask you to take a risk for a cause larger thanourselves,'' he said. ``It is the cause of helping others andthereby America. It is the cause of democratic ideals.''   He said brave people are struggling in the Soviet Union, Polandand China for basic human rights and freedoms that ``our ancesorssecured for us _ and that we too often take for granted.''   Recalling the solitary young man who briefly stopped a column oftanks in Beijing on June 5, Bush said, ``That vivid, unforgettableimage illustrates how precious is the freedom that is America'ssecret weapon and her shield.''   He called volunteerism and community service ``central to ourfabric as a nation, and as a people. No, they aren't as dramatic asthe profiles in courage of Warsaw, the gulags and Tiananmen Square.   ``But they reflect the same sense of sacrifice and of concern ...for country, decency, our fellow man,'' he said.   Bush plans to keep the spotlight on youth and altruism onWednesday at the White House when he announces details of the ``YESto America Initiative.'' The acronym stands for Youth EnteringService.   ``We will refute those who speak of a `me' generation. Insteadthis program can build a cathedral of the spirit, and help yoursbecome a global `we' generation,'' he told the seniors.   Bush has previously announced plans to ask Congress to invest$100 million over four years into a YES Foundation to encourageyoung people to perform community service. He will head thefoundation.   Bush was introduced at Cheltenham by Hang Nguyen, a seniorgraduating with top honors who came to this country as a refugeefrom her native Vietnam in 1975. Her mother still lives there.   ``Each of us has come to this moment in a different way,'' shesaid. ``Our commencement is both a common achievement and a uniqueone. In some ways these ceremonies are like thousands of othersbeing held across the nation.''   But, she added, they were also ``unique because of this class ...this school ... this community'' _ and the commencement speaker.   The 330 Cheltenham seniors had to yield some graduation ticketsand curtail their own speeches to make room for the president andhis entourage.   ``Half of us were excited,'' said Jason Gorman. ``But there werethose who thought it is more important for more of the relatives tocome than the president.''   But another senior, Adam Cherry, said, ``It's the greatest thingthat could happen to a senior class.''   Each graduate got a handshake from Bush, and many of the girlsstole a kiss as well. The graduates wore blue and gold robes, andBush was in academic garb himself.   Cheltenham's alumni include baseball star Reggie Jackson; RobertMeyers, an architect of the Social Security system, and Dr. MichaelBrown, a Nobel Prize winner for medicine.</TEXT></DOC>
