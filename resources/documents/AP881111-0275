(AP) _ A grandson of tobacco company founderR.J. Reynolds has accused RJR Nabisco Inc. executives of trying toamass personal fortunes through the bidding war for the tobacco andconsumer products giant.   ``It is clear that the purpose of this transaction is to make alarge profit for these executives by selling off certain of thecompany's businesses and assets, and by taking other steps torestructure and increase the profitability and value of thecompany,'' Smith W. Bagley said in a letter to Charles Hugel,chairman of a special committee reviewing bids for the conglomerate.   Bagley, an heir to the Reynolds tobacco fortune, said the letterwas written on behalf of himself ``and certain other stockholders ofRJR Nabisco.''   Last month RJR Nabisco President F. Ross Johnson announced a planto take the company private in a $17 billion leveraged buyout. Ifthe group were successful, he and other top executives could end upowning 20 percent of the company, published reports have said. Thatequity would be worth several billion dollars.   Johnson has denied claims the management group would beexcessively compensated in such a buyout.   Bagley, who is a substantial stockholder in RJR Nabisco, outlinedsteps he said the company took to pave the way for the managementbuyout plan, including:   _RJR Nabisco's purchase in April of 21 million shares for $53.50each. (The company's stock currently is trading in the $89-a-sharerange.   _The adoption of a `poison pill' defense to thwart outsidebidders ``not acceptable to management.''   _The preparation ``at stockholder expense of financial studies,analyses and projections concerning a restructuring of the companyand the sale of certain businesses.''   Bagley said the management group tried to discourage bidding bythe buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which launched a$20.23 billion tender offer, and by a group led by Forstmann Littleandamp; Co., which has expressed interest in making an offer.   ``For the executive management of this company ... to devise aplan to take the company private and to divert for themselvesprofits properly accruing to the public stockholders and then toundermine competitive bidding, would be self-dealing and a breach offiduciary duty,'' he said.   ``The stockholders have been paying these top executives, andpaying them handsomely, to run the company for the stockholders'benefit and not to acquire it at the stockholders' expense.''   A spokesman for RJR Nabisco declined to comment on the letter.</TEXT></DOC>
