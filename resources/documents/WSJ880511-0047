With nearly 98% of the votes counted, the four-party bloc that has made up Mr. Schlueter's government since September 1982 emerged with 70 seats in the 179-seat Folketing, the same number it had prior to the election. The major socialist opposition parties lost a total of two seats to end up with 79.    Both the Progress Party, with 16 seats in the new parliament, and the Social Liberal Party, with 10, indicated they would support Mr. Schleuter's government. The right-wing Progress Party, which favors tax reductions and restraints on immigration was yesterday's biggest winner, nearly doubling its previous total of nine seats. The Social Liberals, formerly known as the Radical Liberals, lost one seat.    Mr. Schleuter called yesterday's snap election in response to a measure pushed through parliament by the socialists. The motion, passed April 14, urged the government to inform visiting warships of a peacetime ban on nuclear weapons in Danish territory.    Denmark's NATO allies strongly protested the resolution and hinted that Copenhagen could soon find itself very much on the periphery of the 16-nation alliance it helped to found. Some Western officials recalled that New Zealand was isolated from its allies in 1984 for requiring assurances that visiting ships weren't nuclear-armed.    The government yesterday portrayed the loss of two parliamentary seats by the socialists as a rejection of the socialist position on NATO. But the results are likely to produce a parliament of very similar character to that which it replaces and may continue to cause problems for the government on defense policy.    Late last night, though, Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said he envisioned a solution to the parliamentary measure that caused such consternation in NATO. To comply with the motion without harming relations with the alliance, he said, the government probably will formulate a letter for delivery to warship captains that is similar to one Norway uses. Norway's letter merely reminds ship captains that they are expected to comply with all national laws while in Norwegian waters.    &quot;We don't want to make problems for our allies and we don't want further problems with the cohesion of the alliance,&quot; Mr. Ellemann-Jensen said. &quot;We will be good partners.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
