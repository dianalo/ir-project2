Biggers McLean, Va.andM;Perot Is Part of the ProblemandM;William E. Perry's DP Issues column in the Feb. 20 issue paints H. Ross Perotto be the American idealist.andP;  How can Mr. Perot keep a straight face when hecritizes &quot;our best and brightest&quot; for taking the road to make a quick buckand not for long-term thinking?andP;  Just how long was Mr. Perot at GeneralMotors before he took their money and ran?andP;  He talked a great game but neverchanged GM one iota.andP;  He spoke of a great vision of making GM a competitiveforce in the automobile industry.andP;  He failed!andP;  No, worse than failing, hegave up!andM;Mr.andP;  Perry should read the pages of this newspaper and discover that greatstrides are indeed, finally, being made in the area of standards such asPosix, Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile, Structured QueryLanguage and Ada.andP;  Does he truly believe that the &quot;C&quot; in COBOL stands forcommon?andP;  It's far from common.andP;  Finally the customer (the government) isstarting to dictate these standards to the vendors, as opposed to being toldby the vendor what the standard is.andP;  Look at the dismal failure of IBM's PS/2Micro Channel Architecture, TopView, Microsoft Windows and probably soonOS/2.andM;Mr.andP;  Perry obviously has not worked in the government bureaucracy within thelast 10 or so years since the government started wholesale contracting forservices.andM;The federal government employee has been completely demoralized over the pastfew years despite efforts such as merit pay.andP;  Government employees used totake a great deal of pride in their work.andP;  Now much of that work is merelyoverseeing contractors doing the same work for which they receive twice thepay and benefits.andM;So what's new about systems being late?andP;  The same can be said of the spaceprogram, buildings, roads, motion pictures.andP;  I have over 19 years of computerexperience and don't know the current cost of building a function point oflogic.andP;  Mr. Perry said such lack of awareness was one sign of government ADPcomplacency, but I don't even know what it means!andM;The recent defeat of the executive service pay raise is still anotherdemoralizing blow for government employees.andP;  Sure, it would segregate theupper management from middle managers and those doing the work, but it wouldhave been a good initial step toward keeping good people and, eventually,those at the top would see that the workers, too, needed wages comparable toprivate industry.andM;More H. Ross Perots won't turn America around.andP;  In many instances, they'repart of the problem.andM;I've rarely seen a contractor who would do more than the contract calls for(for free).andP;  It's a hard-enough battle trying to get your honest dollar'sworth from a contractor -- much less a high-quality product, on time andwithin budget.andP;  Gregory J.
