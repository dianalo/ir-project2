The vote was 130-2, with 16 abstentions.   The United States and Israel voted against. Britain and Canadaabstained.   The Palestine Liberation Organization opened the debate Thursdayby accusing Israel of murdering 411 Palestinian civilians since ananti-Israeli insurrection began in the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip 11 months ago.   Every year, the assembly by a lopsided vote condemns Israelihuman rights practices in the occupied lands, captured from Arabfoes in the 1967 Mideast war.   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, the deputy permanentrepresentative, criticized the ``divisive'' resolution and said it``hinders the search for peace in the region.   ``It is an unbalanced document, condemning one of the parties forits actions without taking into account acts of violence by theother side. The harsh rhetoric in this resolution can only inflamean already embittered situation, making it more difficult to proceedtoward a negotiated settlement,'' he said.   Okun said U.S. policy calls for a negotiated settlement which``will require an exchange of territory for peace. ... (Israel's)security ... must be assured. At the same time, the legitimatepolitical rights of the Palestinian people must be recognized.''   The resolution said the assembly ``condemns Israel's persistentpolicies and practices violating the human rights of the Palestinianpeople in the occupied territories, including Jerusalem.''   It cited fatal shootings and woundings by the Israeli army andsettlers of ``defenseless Palestinian civilians, the beating andbreaking of bones, deportation, imposition of restrictive economicmeasures, demolition of houses, collective punishment anddetentions, as well as denial of access to the media.''   It ``demands that Israel, the occupying power, abide immediatelyand scrupulously'' by the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention onprotecting civilians in time of war and halt all violations of thatconvention.   Israel told the assembly the United Nations was being``hijacked'' by some Arab nations in a counterproductive debate onthe territories which ``incites and encourages violence'' and blockspeace agreements. Israel said it would continue efforts to restoreorder and would exercise ``maximum restraint.''   The Israeli ambassador, Johanan Bein, condemned what he calledPalestinian inhumanity in burning familes alive by firebombs,planting bombs in civilian buses and throwing grenades at sidewalkcafes and toy shops full of children.   M. Nasser al-Kidwa, PLO deputy U.N. representative, told theGeneral Assembly that 411 civilians, including 60 women, were killedand 4,500 wounded from Dec. 8, 1987, when the insurrection began, toOct. 30.   Other estimates put the toll at more than 300 Palestinians and 10Israelis.   An additional 11,400 Palestinians from the 1.5 millionPalestinian population were detained without trial, he charged.   Kidwa said that besides shootings, beatings, use of plasticbullets and of tear gas, and the like, Israeli soldiers tried tobury some Palestinians alive. He said some pregnant women lost theirunborn babies as a result of beatings or inhaling tear gas.   The 143-page U.N. report by Daya R. Perera, ambassador of SriLanka, said: ``The report reflects the dramatic deterioration of thehuman rights situation in the occupied territories since thebeginning of the uprising.''   The report covered the period from Sept. 4, 1987, to last Aug. 26.   The document said Israel's occupation of the territories itselfis a violation of human rights.   The report said that ``while several thousands of civilians havebeen physically injured, the entire Palestinian population hassuffered from the Israeli policy of `force, power and blows''' andof the ``iron fist.''   It said in the long run, protection can only be ensured throughnegotiation of a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of theArab-Israeli conflict.</TEXT></DOC>
