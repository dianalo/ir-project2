Temperatures hovered at 102 on Friday and the Health Ministrywarned that citizens should drink more water and mix it with saltto fend off dehydration. It also cautioned against drinking unsafewater, the cause of the diarrhea outbreak.   The government has given no statistics for drought-relateddeaths. But the state-owned Bangladesh Times said 100 people in thenorthern drought-hit regions had died of diarrhea in the past twoweeks. It quoted local health officials as recording 3,000 cases ofpeople seeking treatment for diarrhea.   The newspaper Banglar Bani said 45 people died from the heat inthe Rajshahi, Rangpur and Nilphamari districts of northwesternBangladesh in the past 10 days. It said 15 others died in theneighboring Bogra, Padma and Dinajpur districts.   The Bengali-language daily said crops had withered, ponds andlakes had dried up, and there was not enough groundwater to operatepumps.   Other newspapers put the heat wave death toll at 30 for the last10 days. A privately owned news agency, United News of Bangladesh,said 20 people died from heat in the last week.   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,declined to confirm or deny the death tolls. They said people haddied but they were unable to give numbers because of the remotenessof the regions.   The Education Ministry ordered all schools in the 16 of thecountry's 64 districts to close until the summer monsoon rainsarrive to ease the three-month drought.   Earlier this week, temperatures reached 107. The government'sweather office said there appeared to be no chance of rain for atleast a week.   Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries with a percapita income of only $160 a year, alternates between devastatingdrought and innundating floods, as well as being buffeted bycyclones and tornadoes.   Last summer, more than 1,400 died when monsoon-swollen riversflooded four-fifths of the nation. Another 1,100 died in cyclonesin November.   Late last month, President Hussain Muhammad Ershad lednationwide prayers for rain to ease the current drought for his 110million countrymen and women. The following day rains came,accompanied by tornadoes that killed more than 1,100 people andleft 130,000 homeless.   The current drought threatens to destroy at least 50 percent ofthe spring grain crops now in the ground. The government hadcounted on the the spring harvest to yield 5.6 million tons of riceand wheat, about one-fourth of the country's annual needs.</TEXT></DOC>
