The ship, the Nisshin Maru No. 3, will arrive in the AntarcticOcean in December, where it will be joined by three catcher boats,said Nobuyuki Yagi, a Fishery Agency official.   Japan halted commercial whaling in the Antarctic at the end ofthe 1986-87 season, during which it caught 1,941 whales. It thenbegan a program of research whaling which it says is aimed atassessing whale stocks.   Japan killed 273 small minke whales, a non-endangered species,in the first year of the research program and 241 last year.   In 1986, the International Whaling Commission imposed amoratorium on commercial whaling to allow scientists to assesswhale stocks without the disruption caused by regular whalingactivities.   However, under the organization's charter, member nations areallowed to conduct research whaling whenever they wish.   The official said Japan hopes its research will prove thatenough of some species remain to allow a resumption of limitedcommercial whaling when the commission's moratorium comes up forreview next year.   ``But judging from the current positions of the members of thecommission, it looks very unlikely that the ban will be lifted,''he said.   Japanese whaling officials have said that at least 825 whalesmust be caught to make the research program scientificallyaccurate, and the quota for the program's first year was initially875. But strong opposition from international environmental groupsand other commission members led Japan to reduce the quota to 300.   The meat obtained by the research program is sold for food, aspermitted under commission regulations.   At an annual meeting of the 38-member commission in June, Japanalso asked for special permission to catch 320 minke whales alongits coast to ``alleviate the suffering'' of several whaling townswhere it said 789 people have lost their jobs because of the ban.The request was turned down by the commission.   Japan is the world's largest consumer of whale meat, andofficials say the food is an important part of the country'sculture.   In the early 1960s, when Japanese whaling was at its peak,whales provided 23 percent of all meat consumed in the country.Since then, declining whale supplies have turned it into adelicacy, and the Nisshin Maru is the only remaining processingship.   Whaling officials say whales must be killed during the researchto accurately determine their age, sex, diet and health. Butanti-whaling groups say non-lethal research methods are available,such as skin sampling.   Minke whales, a smaller species, are currently estimated by theIWC to number about 730,000, Yagi said.   Norway and Iceland also conduct research whaling, but Icelandhas announced it will end its research whaling program at the endof this season.</TEXT></DOC>
