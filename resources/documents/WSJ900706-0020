The Office of Thrift Supervision alleged that Mr. Spiegelused funds from the Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift to pay forEuropean travel for him and his wife, a $55,000 guncollection including Uzi submachine guns and automaticpistols, $7,000 in tickets to a Michael Jackson concert, andpersonal use of Columbia Savings aircraft and four resortcondominiums.</LP><TEXT>   The thrift office said one of the condominiums, in JacksonHole, Wyo., was used almost exclusively by Michael Milken,the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond chief whopleaded guilty earlier this year to securities fraud, and hisbrother, attorney Lowell Milken, without reimbursingColumbia.   As part of the restitution, the office is seeking $6.4million from Mr. Spiegel for losses allegedly suffered byColumbia in a partnership with Michael Milken that bought two30-seat jets and built a luxury airplane hangar. Neither ofthe Milken brothers was charged with any wrongdoing. ColumbiaSavings bought several billion dollars of high-yield,high-risk junk bonds from Drexel.   In a statement, Mr. Spiegel said he was &quot;outraged&quot; at thethrift office decision and forcefully denies all of thecharges. He said the office had refused to meet with hisattorneys to discuss the allegations and to give him a &quot;fairchance to respond.&quot;   His statement continued: &quot;. . . historically, OTS and itspredecessors have been abysmal failures and now, in panic andfor purely political reasons, OTS is seeking scapegoats todivert public attention from its gross incompetence.&quot; Mr.Spiegel is being represented by New York criminal defenselawyer Robert Morvillo, who recently successfully defendedSaudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi against charges linked toformer Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos.   The case against Mr. Spiegel is an important one for thethrift office. Not only was it initiated on the same day theoffice announced a new policy of making such administrativeactions public, but it is the largest number of charges, thelargest restitution, and the largest civil fine ever soughtfrom an individual by the agency.   Also, Congress, responding to constituents' outrage aboutthe costs of the Sandamp;L bailout, is in a paroxysm of electionseason denunciation of Sandamp;L crime and will be watching thecase carefully. If the allegations are proven, Mr. Spiegelwould join the list of Sandamp;L executives who have used thriftsas personal piggy banks.   Thrift office director Timothy Ryan wouldn't say whetherany criminal action was being sought against Mr. Spiegel, buthe said the Justice Department was involved in theinvestigation that led to the administrative charges. He alsosaid the thrift office is investigating &quot;at least three otherinstitutions&quot; and their junk-bond dealings with Drexel.   The administrative action comes as Columbia is beingrequired, under last year's savings-and-loan bailout law, toliquidate its once hugely profitable junk-bond holdings.Currently valued at about $2.9 billion, the portfolio hasdeclined in value by about $1 billion over the last sixmonths, leaving Columbia insolvent and on the verge offederal takeover. Company officials have expressed confidencethat they will be able to sell the bonds, however, to helpminimize the institution's losses.   Mr. Spiegel, whose father Abraham is Columbia's chairman,resigned under pressure as Columbia's president and chiefexecutive in December and was a consultant until this pastspring.   In addition to the costs for the airplanes, the thriftoffice is seeking the following restitution:   -- $2.9 million for a bonus paid to Mr. Spiegel last year.Regulators objected when Columbia paid Mr. Spiegel a $3million bonus, the thrift office said, and in response, Mr.Spiegel returned $600,000. The office is seeking the returnof the remaining $2.4 million plus interest.   -- $5.7 million for losses allegedly incurred by Columbiaon $28 million in loans made to Howard Schneider, a luxuryauto dealer and friend of Mr. Spiegel. The office said Mr.Schneider lent Mr. Spiegel a Mercedes 560 SEL and a Bentleywhile the loans were being negotiated. The office alleged theloans were made at below-market interest rates and weren'tproperly documented. Mr. Schneider wasn't charged withwrongdoing.   -- $2.4 million for allegedly unauthorized payments madeto a charitable foundation controlled by Mr. Spiegel. Thethrift office said most of the foundation assets wereinvested in junk bonds and Columbia stock.   -- $1.1 million for the alleged personal use of fourcondominiums owned by Columbia, including two in JacksonHole, one in Indian Wells, Calif., and one in Deer Valley,Utah.   -- $463,000 allegedly used for personal expenses,including four trips to Europe for Mr. Spiegel and his wife,$55,000 in guns, the Michael Jackson tickets and also ticketsto a Steve Winwood concert, $2,000 for a French wine-tastingcourse and $1,700 for silverware.   The total restitution of $19 million would go to Columbia.The thrift office is also seeking $5 million in civilpenalties that would go to the government.   The action freezes Mr. Spiegel's funds and assets with anyfinancial institution until he establishes an escrow accountor puts up other security to guarantee the restitution. He isalso prohibited from voting his Columbia stock. Mr. Ryan ofthe thrift office said the agency is convinced Mr. Spiegelhas the wealth to pay the restitution and fine. The officealso is seeking to bar Mr. Spiegel from working in anyfederally insured bank or thrift in the future.   Mr. Spiegel has 20 days to reply to the thrift office andrequest a hearing.   Mr. Spiegel's compensation at Columbia has long been anissue for regulators. In 1985, for instance, he earned anestimated $9 million in salary and benefits, roughly 17 timeswhat the chairman of the nation's largest Sandamp;L was making.Columbia was also the top-earning Sandamp;L in the country at thattime, but the package drew a public rebuke from federalthrift regulators.   Earlier this year, regulators ordered that a $500,000annual consulting fee that Mr. Spiegel was receiving fromColumbia be reduced to $1 a year.</TEXT></DOC>
