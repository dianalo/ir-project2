The diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by theflood of statements issued from Iraq in the name of the ProvisionalFree Kuwait Government.   Britain's U.N. ambassador, Crispin Tickell, called the Iraqiaction ``an invasion from the outside ... a phony coup d'etat fromwithin.'' He said the invasion had led to ``the purportedestablishment of a puppet government.''   In a rare display of solidarity, the United States and theSoviet Union called for Iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions. TheU.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion.   But Iraq's deputy permanent U.N. representative, Sabah TalatKadrat, said the Security Council should not be debating the issue,because the fall of the Kuwaiti Emir, Sheik Jaber Al-AhmedAl-Sabah, was an internal matter.   The official Kuwait News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, did notissue a single story all day. Its computer periodically sputteredout the phrase ``Line cut.''   On the other hand, state-run Iraqi News Agency from Baghdad camealive with a series of communiques from the ``provisionalgovernment.'' The members were not identified.   The first statement said the provisional government ``finds thatone of its primordial obligations is to remedy the harm done by thedeposed, corrupt government to our brothers in Iraq.''   Iraq has been feuding with Kuwait over a border dispute. It hasalso accused Kuwait of violating its oil production quotas set bythe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, costing Iraq ofmuch-needed revenues because oil is cheaper when supplies arehigher.   The statement on the Iraqi News Agency said the border disputewould be settled with ``fraternity and Arab national interests,''indicating Iraq would probably take the land it wants.   The statement also said the Al-Sabah family, which had ruledKuwait for almost 250 years, was working in concert with Zionistand colonial powers to plot against Iraq.   That is the charge the Iraqi press leveled at Kuwait whentensions began to rise in mid-July.   ``Falsification of elections, authoritarianism, persecution ofpatriotic personalities have always been characteristics of theAl-Sabah family,'' the statement said.   Kuwait is one of the few Arab states that has experimented witha freely elected parliament. A new National Council with 50 membersvoted into office and 25 appointed by the emir took office afterJune elections.   The communiques from the Iraqi News Agency said the NationalCouncil has been disbanded.</TEXT></DOC>
