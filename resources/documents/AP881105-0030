Ralf Traugott, a German-born American citizen who was on thehijacked airliner, also said Friday that he received a mysterioustelephone call recently in which a caller identified himself as a``Mr. Hamadi.''   ``About four weeks ago I got a telephone call. I thought it waskind of strange,'' Traugott said. ``The man on the other end of theline said `Hello Mr. Ralf.'''   ``I said, `Who's this?,' and he said, `Mr. Hamadi. This isBeirut, Lebanon calling,''' Traugott testified.   He said the man then hung up without mentioning Hamadi's trial.Traugott was not further questioned about the call and did not sayif he thought it was a threat.   Hamadi comes from a family of 11 children. An older brother,Abdul-Hadi, is security chief in Beirut for the fanatical Hezbollah(Party of God) organization.   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder, airpiracy and other crimes in the hijacking. Thirty-nine Americans wereheld hostage 17 days and a 23-year-old Navy diver, Rogert Stethem,was killed in the ordeal.   Traugott caused a stir in the courtroom when he produced aLebanese newspaper, An-Nahar, dated June 16, 1985, two days afterTWA Flight 847 was seized on a flight from Athens to Rome.   The newspaper's account of the hijacking then in progress atBeirut airport included photographs of the hijacked plane and aphotograph of Stethem's body lying on the tarmac.   Traugott said Hamadi had been reading the newspaper aboard theplane and when ``I asked him what was in it, he said, `This is theman we killed.' I asked him, `Did you shoot him?'''   ``He said, `No, my friend shot him,''' Traugott testified. ``Hesaid it very nonchalantly, like it was no big deal.''   Hamadi admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied shootingStethem. He blamed the killing on his accomplice, identified bycourt documents as Hassan Ezzeddine.   In another conversation on the hijacked plane, Hamadi toldTraugott he was a member of the Hezbollah, and had been trained inIran, Traugott testified.   Hamadi previously denied being a member of Hezbollah, a radicalLebanese Shiite group backed by Iran.   Another former American hostage, Steve Willet, testified Fridayand confirmed statements by earlier witnesses that the hijackersbrutally beat the passengers.   Under guidelines set by the court to protect the witnesses'security, neither witness named his current residence.   At the time of the hijacking, Traugott's address was given asLunenburg, Mass., while Willet lived in Choupic, La.   Hamadi declined comment on Friday's testimony.   Hamadi's Lebanese parents arrived Friday in West Germany totestify next Tuesday, when the trial resumes, about their son'schildhood in war-torn Beirut.   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport in January 1987 as hetried to smuggle liquid explosives into West Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
