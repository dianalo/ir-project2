The removal comes under the terms of an arms treaty signed byPresident Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December.   ``It's the first time that U.S. intermediate-range missiles havebeen withdrawn in Europe,'' U.S. Navy Cmdr. Gerry Ryan of theEuropean Command Headquarters in Stuttgart told The AssociatedPress.   ``The remainder of the U.S. Army European-based,intermediate-range nuclear missiles are scheduled to be removedover a 36-month period,'' he said.   A group of anti-nuclear activists who came to witness theremoval applauded as the 15 U.S. Army trucks bearing the missilesbegan leaving the site in southern West Germany.   The group held up a banner saying ``Heilbronn, Never Again ANuclear Powder Keg.''   The nine Pershing 2 missiles had been deployed as part of a NATOplan to station 572 intermediate-range nuclear missiles in fiveWest European countries to counter Soviet rockets pointed at theWest.   The United States had stationed 108 Pershing 2 missiles and 96cruise missiles at four bases in West Germany as part of the plan.   Deployment of the missiles began late in 1983 and led to massiveprotests in Western Europe, especially in West Germany.   But the anti-missile fervor waned, and by the time theintermediate-range missile treaty was signed last year only ahandful of protesters was still active on a daily basis in WestGermany.         Ryan told the AP that a truck convoy carrying the missiles leftthe Camp Redleg U.S. Army missile site near the southern city ofHeilbronn at about 10 a.m. today.   Heilbronn is about 35 miles north of Stuttgart.   One part of the convoy was heading to a U.S. Army post inFrankfurt, while another part was heading to a different base ``inpreparation for air transport back to elimination sites in theUnited States,'' Ryan said.   U.S. officials have said that some of the rockets would bedestroyed at the Frankfurt site, and that the nuclear warheadswould be shipped back ``to the appropriate authority,'' in theUnited States.   Under terms of the INF traty, the Soviet Union and United Statesagreed to eliminate all land-based intermediate-range nuclearmissiles, which have a range of up to 3,000 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
