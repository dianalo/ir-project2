Attorneys for Donald Rochon, 40, and the FBI signed an agreementthis week that settles the three-year-old legal battle arising fromthe black agent's charges he was harassed by white colleagues whenhe worked in the FBI's Chicago office.   The settlement is a further admission by the FBI of racialproblems in its ranks.   Officials earlier this year acknowledged that the FBI hadsettled three other racial discrimination suits, including oneinvolving 30 employees of the fingerprint identification division.   The FBI announced the settlement with Rochon on Wednesday butdeclined to give details.   Rochon, who has been on disability leave since April because ofemotional stress, will receive full compensation and full pensionbenefits under the terms of the settlement, said his attorney,David Kairys of Philadelphia.   Rochon will remain on disability leave until he is eligible toretire in 11 years, Kairys said. As a result of the emotionalstrain, ``he never wants to go back to the FBI,'' the lawyer said.   The FBI has also agreed to award Rochon some back pay for apromotion the agent claims he was unfairly denied, Kairys said. Itwill also pay Rochon's former wife, Susan, a sum of money ascompensation, Kairys said. The attorney declined to disclose theamount of that sum.   But overall, the lawyer said, the entire settlement could beworth more than a million dollars.   The FBI also agreed to conduct a full investigation of Rochon'sclaims and make public its findings by next April, Rochon said.   Under the terms of the settlement Rochon will receive disabilitypayments under a finding by the Labor Department that he isentitled to federal workmen's compensation for his emotionaldistress, Kairys said.   In addition, the FBI will pay the difference between thedisability insurance and what Rochon would earn if he remained withthe FBI. After a year of further leave, Rochon will be formallyseparated from the bureau but will continue to receive raises andget a pension when he reaches retirement age in 11 years, Kairyssaid.   Agents become eligible to retire on their 51st birthday.   Rochon will be paid the average salary of FBI agents who joinedthe bureau when he did in 1981, taking into account promotions thatsome of his colleagues received, Kairys said. This provision of thesettlement gives Rochon the so-called ``front pay'' allowed incivil rights law for employees who are forced to leave hostile workenvironments.   Rochon also received as $6,000 award to cover moving expensesthat the FBI originally refused to pay when he was transferred athis request from Chicago to Philadelphia.   Kairys said week-long negotiations ended with the signing of asettlement agreement on Wednesday. Motions to dismiss thecomplaints will be filed in federal courts in both Chicago andWashington, where Rochon had suits pending.   Kairys expressed surprise that the FBI had agreed to settle thecase after refusing to do in the past.   Several years ago, the federal judge who presided over theWashington case had urged Justice Department lawyers and attorneysrepresenting individual agents named in the complaint to settle thecase, but those talks broke down quickly.   Rochon claimed his family received threatening telephone callsand letters, including one that contained a picture of thedismembered body of a black man. Another contained a bull's eyesuperimposed with a picture of a black man.   One white FBI agent, Gary W. Miller, acknowledged in a 1985affidavit that he forged Rochon's signature on an application for adeath and dismemberment insurance policy for the black agent'sfamily.   Another Chicago agent, Richard Ganslein, was recently added tothe suit in that city after the plaintiffs had discovered he hadadmitted participating in the harassment, Kairys said.</TEXT></DOC>
