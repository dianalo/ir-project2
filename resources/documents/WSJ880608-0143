The House yesterday passed and sent to the president legislation that will give the justices of the Supreme Court more control over which cases they decide and which ones they simply deny review. President Reagan is expected to sign the bill, which passed the Senate in March. The law would take effect in 90 days -- just before the next court term opens in October.    But the ease with which the House approved the measure, without any opposition and with the support of all nine Supreme Court justices, belies an 11-year struggle to pass what Rep. Robert Kastenmeier (D., Wis.) yesterday called &quot;the most significant jurisdictional reform affecting the high court in over 60 years.&quot;    Along the way, Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) tried to use an early version of the bill in 1979 to remove school prayer cases from the Supreme Court's jurisdiction. And last year a Reagan administration Justice Department official tried briefly to make wholesale changes in the proposal, until Chief Justice William Rehnquist complained to Attorney General Edwin Meese.    The legislation eliminates what is called the mandatory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Of the roughly 4,500 cases on which the Supreme Court acts each year, the justices have complete freedom in 95%, or about 4,280, to decide to hear arguments and issue an opinion or to simply deny review without setting any legal precedent. But, by law, the high court has less freedom in deciding how to handle some 5% of the cases, about 220 a year.    In 1925, Congress said that the Supreme Court has discretion to refuse to hear cases, except when a state supreme court strikes down a federal law or upholds a state law that was challenged as violating the Constitution, or when a federal appeals court strikes down a state law or a federal appeals or district court strikes down a federal law, all on constitutional grounds.    In recent years, as the volume of cases appealed to the high court increased, the justices and other constitutional specialists began to complain that these so-called mandatory cases were using up too much of the court's resources. Last term, 31 of the court's 145 decisions were in mandatory appeals. &quot;The court must often call for full briefing and oral argument in difficult issues which are of little significance,&quot; the justices wrote in a 1982 letter to Congress.    In mandatory cases, the court's action is supposed to set a precedent, regardless of how the court handles the dispute; the justices often feel compelled to rule on such cases in brief orders without hearing argument. &quot;Such decisions sometimes create more confusion than they seek to resolve,&quot; the justices wrote in 1982.    Elimination of mandatory appeals reverses the court's early history. From the court's first meeting in 1790 until 1891, the justices had almost no discretion over which cases they decided. Only with the creation of the federal appeals courts in 1891 did Congress give the court discretion.    Legal specialists say repeal of mandatory review won't hurt the ability of individuals or state and local governments to obtain Supreme Court hearings. &quot;It makes eminent sense,&quot; says Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe.    Eliminating mandatory appeals passed the Senate in 1979. But the House didn't act because the bill included a Helms amendment leaving school prayer to the states. In 1982 and 1984, similar proposals passed the House, but never came up in the Senate, for fear that amendments on school prayer or abortion might be added. This year, the Senate passed the bill first and it went apparently unnoticed by opponents like Mr. Helms.    Last year, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Markman urged a House subcommittee to retain some mandatory appeals, a reversal of the department position. But Chief Justice Rehnquist interceded, according to congressional, judicial and Justice Department aides, and Mr. Meese agreed not to press for changes.    No one expects repeal of mandatory appeals to eliminate the high court's workload problems. Many of the appeals are still likely to be reviewed, because the legal issues they pose are important. But supporters of the move agree it will help the court manage case volume more effectively.    However, the appeals that no longer occupy the court's oral argument time are likely to be replaced by others, according to speeches by several justices in recent years, leaving the court still feeling pressed to keep up. Chief Justice Rehnquist has said there are too many critical legal issues to be decided for the court to be able to reduce the number of decisions. </TEXT></DOC>
