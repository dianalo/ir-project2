The pyrolysis product of terrestrial kerogencontains predominantly phenols, while that of marine kerogen, aliphatichydrocarbons. The ratios of total phenols/total aliphatics obtained bythe visual kerogen and Rock-Eval analyses agree with each other. Theresult indicates that the ratio of phenol/C{sub 12} is an indicator inthe type analysis of kerogen. The ratios in the samples of woody coaland amorphous coal are 2 or more and 0.5 or less, respectively. (12 figs,1 tab, 13 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
