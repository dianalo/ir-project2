<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-40-0315 </DOCNO><TEXT>The development and potential of large wind turbine generators and alternativemethods for their integration into Canadian utility networks are reviewed.The modes of integration include a fuel saving mode, where wind generatorsprovide the maximum possible power into the network and the conventionalplants reduce their power output by the same amount. The limitation tothis is that must-run generation capacity cannot be displaced, and underhigh wind conditions some of the wind generators would have to be shutdown, thus reducing their utilization factor and increasing the costof wind energy. To avoid this problem, another operating mode uses energystorage for absorbing excess wind power. If the network includes hydrogeneration, the energy storage can mean that either the water not useddue to wind power generation is stored in the reservoir for possiblepeaking duty; or excess wind power is used to operate pumped storagesystems. With these options in mind, energy cost comparisons are madefor wind turbine generation and conventional generation. Indicationsare that with mass production of the turbine units, payback periods of6-24 months are possible for 2.5 MW or larger vertical axis machines.Capital cost comparisons indicate wind generation is able to competewith conventional forms. The economics of wind power improves as thesize of the turbine increases. 2 refs., 9 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
