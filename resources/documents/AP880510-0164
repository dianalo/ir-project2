The vote was 14-1, despite efforts to moderate the resolution toavoid a U.S. veto.   The United States frequently exercises its veto to killresolutions critical of the Jewish state.   The vote came after a three-day debate requested by Lebanon,which protested the two-day incursion.   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters, explaining the U.S. veto,said the Security Council should not discuss southern Lebanon inresolutions ``that fail to recognize the attacks and reprisalsoriginating on both sides of the Israeli-Lebanese border.''   He said that armed Palestinians, supported by pro-Iraniangroups, repeatedly have tried to enter Israel from Lebanon in thelast four months to carry out violent acts.   ``We cannot accept a resolution that does not acknowledge thewell-known fact that hostile acts against Israel are originating inLebanon,'' he said.   Walters said the United States supports the independence,territorial integrity and unity of Lebanon. Washington has calledfor withdrawal of all foreign forces and the extension of centralgovernment authority throughout that country, he said.   But, he said, ``the sad truth remains that as long as armed,extremist elements use southern Lebanon to stage terrorist attacksagainst Israel, the border cannot be secure.''   British Ambassador John Birch, the deputy permanentrepresentative, said the resolution failed to consider attacksagainst Israel and hostilities on both sides of theIsraeli-Lebanese border. But he said Israel's latest incursion hasdone damage to its cause and said Britain would vote for theresolution ``in view of the excesses of Israel.''   Israel said the two-day operation last week was necessary toroot out terrorists who stage attacks against Israel from Lebaneseterritory.   Israel said three Israeli soldiers and more than 40 Arabguerrillas died in two days of fighting in south Lebanon last week.   The meeting Tuesday was the sixth Security Council meeting insix months called to deplore Israel's handling of the Palestinianuprising, its deportation of Palestinians, its military actions insouth Lebanon and the assassination of a PLO leader in Tunisia thathas been blamed on Israel.   In addition to the United States, the Security Council membersare Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union _ the fivepermanent members with veto power _ and Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,Italy, Japan, Nepal, Senegal, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.</TEXT></DOC>
