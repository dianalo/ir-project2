Superconducting magnets began to be used in the beginningof 1980's. In Japan there are 112 MRI systems now, and among these nearly50 are superconducting systems, and the adoption of this system is increasingremarkably. Superconducting magnets feature high magnetic field, highquality and high stability and are very suitable for MRI. However, theyhave some drawbacks. The following are problems yet to be solved forsuperconducting magnets: (1) Improvement in performance -- High magneticfields of 3-4 T, for example, and field homogeneity are required. (2)Economy and convenience -- Price as low as that of X-ray CT, convenience,compactness and lightness of weight are required. (3) Development of4K refrigerator system. (4) Introduction of active shield method. (5)Others. (10 figs, 6 tabs, 8 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
