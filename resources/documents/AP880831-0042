Two part-time actors said Tuesday they posed as people withsexual problems to get on national television, putting one over onOprah Winfrey, Sally Jessy Raphael and Gerald Rivera.   Tani Freiwald, 37, and Wes Bailey, 33, both of Chicago, appearedTuesday on yet another talk show, ``CBS This Morning.''   ``After you go through the first one, they get really easy,''Ms. Freiwald said.   Ms. Freiwald said she first appeared in November on ``The OprahWinfrey Show'' in Chicago, posing as a woman who had been married14 years and hated sex.   ``I don't see anyway we could have double checked this guest's(Ms. Freiwald's) story based on the fact that she was presented tous on a doctor's referral,'' said Debra DiMaio, Winfrey's executiveproducer.   ``I consider it to be an isolated incident _ I don't think thereare a lot of people who want to come on national television andcreate a personal problem that's probably considered embarrassingby the general public.''   Bailey and Ms. Freiwald said they were asked to appear on thetalk shows by a Chicago psychologist-author, Dean C. Dauw, for whomMs. Freiwald was working as an office manager.   ``He asked me to do it because the surrogates he does haveworking for him are neither presentable or articulate enough'' togo on television, Ms. Freiwald said.   Dauw did not return calls to his home or office, but he wasquoted by the Omaha World-Herald as saying that Ms. Freiwald workedas an office manager and a sex surrogate, a stand-in sexual partneremployed by a therapist, and Bailey was a client and that they werenot acting.   In May, Ms. Freiwald and Bailey appeared on ``The Sally JessyRaphael Show,'' which originates from New Haven, Conn., with Baileyposing as an impotent husband and Ms. Freiwald as his sexsurrogate. In July, they appeared on ``Geraldo,'' Bailey playing a35-year-old virgin and Ms. Freiwald, a sex surrogate.   Bailey said the only time he was worried during the talk-showstints was when Raphael assured the studio audience that the twowere not actors reproducing a scene.   ``There was a little clenching in the stomachs ... but we'veboth been performers all our adult lives,'' Bailey said.   Burt Dubrow, Raphael's executive producer, said the show wassimply duped, despite its safeguards.   ``How do you know you're really talking to Burt Dubrow?'' heasked during a telephone interview. ``You don't. We have basicallythe same procedures as you do. We go to people who are credible andlegitimate. In this particular case we went to a doctor who wroteseven books, we asked him if he knew of a sex surrogate, and hefound someone who worked for him. ... He's claiming as early asthis morning to me that she is a sex surrogate, so we don't knowexactly where we stand.''   Rivera reacted angrily Monday when he learned the realidentities of his ``guests.''   ``These people are admitting now to having committed fraud or atleast misrepresentation ... and we're going to go after them,''Rivera said.   ``This is something that goes right to the integrity of thebroadcast itself. I'm really spitting mad.''   Delia Fine, his senior producer, said guests are often foundwith the help of experts and organizations and then put through arigorous pre-interview process.   ``If someone really has the intention to put one over on you,I'm not sure what all the safeguards are to protect yourself,'' shesaid.   Ms. Fine said guests sign a release ``that says basicallythey're going to be telling the truth.''   ``We absolutely try and do everything we can do, but if someoneis determined to do it there always are ways to get through,'' saidLorri Benson, senior producer of ``Donahue,'' which was not avictim this time.   ``Thank God we weren't involved in this one, but it does, Ithink, hurt everybody's credibility.''</TEXT></DOC>
