Thisfibre has a thickness in the range 150-300 {mu}m, and is a long wavelengthfibre for conveying light whose wavelength is in the range of 0.7 to1.7 {mu}m. The light source uses lasers or super-luminescent diodes,a preferred light source being an array of individual laser diodes whichare pulsed and/or cooled to improve power handling capacity. These diodeseach feed optical energy into a short length of optical fibre and thesefibres are coupled via an optical coupler into the main transmittingfibre. At the receiving end another optical coupler feeds via individualfibres an array of detectors, each of which is preferably a photo-voltaiccell formed of layers of suitable doped indium phosphide and indium galliumarsenide. Each such cell has its own output electrodes and these cellsare connectable in series, parallel or series/parallel dependent on thedesired output.</TEXT></DOC>
