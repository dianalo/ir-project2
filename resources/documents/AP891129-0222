Carlos Nobre, an engineer and meteorologist with the institute,said Wednesday the findings were the result of a year-long study atthe University of Maryland using a supercomputer belonging to NASA.   Nobre said he used mathematical formulas to project the effectsof deforestation, which he estimates destroys 14,000 square milesof rain forest a year.   The computer predicted the huge wilderness could dry up and turninto a vast, scrub-covered savanna, he said.   ``The advance of pasture land would profoundly change thelandscape and the way of life in the region,'' the scientist saidat the institute in Sao Jose dos Campos, 200 miles southwest of Rio.   Nobre said the destruction of trees to clear land for plantingand grazing reduces the forest's capacity to retain water.   As a result, temperatures will rise, rainfall will diminish andthe soil will become poorer, he said. Even the water level inrivers will fall, reducing the hydroelectric potential.   When that happens, Nobre said, the rain forest would succumb toa long dry season and turn into a savanna, covered with scrub treesand grass.   The 2 million-square-mile Brazilian Amazon is the world'slargest wilderness. Independent studies show 12 percent of it hasbeen destroyed, mostly by small farmers and cattle ranchers usingslash-and-burn techniques. The government claims the correct figureis 5 percent.   Scientists say destruction of the rain forest adds to thegreenhouse effect, which traps the sun's rays and causes globalwarming.   The Brazilian government, under fire from environmentalists,recently announced that burnings in the Amazon were far less thanin previous years.</TEXT></DOC>
