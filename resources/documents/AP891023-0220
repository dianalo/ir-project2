The nickname stems from the financial business assumed to becarried on by the train's passengers in Luxembourg, which has longlured investors because of its strict banking secrecy and taxbreaks.   But the country, which is smaller than Rhode Island andovershadowed by neighboring Belgium, France and West Germany, hasbeen honing other financial skills to compete in the single marketthat will be created in late 1992 when the 12 nations of theEuropean Economic Community take down old trade barriers thatrestrict the free movement of people, money, goods and services.   Local officials appear to want to shed Luxembourg's image as asavings and tax haven. Several interviewed played down theimportance of the country's secrecy and tax provisions.   Whatever, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, a country of just372,000 people (about the same as Cincinnati, Ohio), clearly hasappeal.   Luxembourg now has 156 banks _ only a handful American _ many ofwhich are on Boulevard Royal, known as Luxembourg's Wall Street.   About 650 investment funds and some 100 reinsurance companiesalso operate from here. The stock market trades some 8,400 issues,about 75 percent of which are bonds denominated in dollars or majorEuropean currencies.   In an interview, Prime Minister Jacques Santer expressedsatisfaction with the financial center.   ``(It) has not only grown but has also ... developed its ownspecificity and is now competitive with all other, biggercenters,'' he said in his office at government house.   The center was hurt by the banking crisis in the early 1980swhen major developing countries were unable to meet their foreigndebt payments.   But it has since rebounded and the outlook remains bright,according to analysts.   Among the advantages they cite are the country's social andpolitical stability, central location in the European EconomicCommunity, strong government support and multilingual population.It also has no central bank to apply credit controls or reserverequirements on banks as a means of shaping monetary policy.   Moreover, a recent report from the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development, a group of 24 industrialized nations,remarked on the country's pluses:   ``One of the special attractions of the Luxembourg financialmarket from a tax standpoint is that there is no withholding tax ondividend or interest payments for non-residents and thatstockmarket transactions are not taxed.   ``Here too, changes in the taxation system _ corporation taxreduced from 40 to 34 percent between 1987 and 1989, the abolitionof stamp duty on securities issues _ mean that the Grand Duchy nowranks as one of the world's most attractive financial markets.''   Still another advantage, it said, was a decision this year tospell out the right to banking secrecy in relation to taxauthorities. Disclosure of information about customers' bankaccounts is prohibited, except in criminal cases.   Moves to strengthen the financial center will no doubt helpLuxembourg compete in the 1992 market that will be formed when theEEC lifts the trade barriers.   The EEC already has approved measures requiring the lifting ofcontrols on the movement of capital _ or money _ by July 1.   France and Italy, which still have some restrictions on foreignbank accounts held by their citizens, intend to comply, possiblybefore that date. Less-advanced member nations _ Portugal, Spain,Ireland and Greece _ have more time to do so.   The OECD report cautions that the single market drive ``meansthat Luxembourg will almost certainly have to adjust again tochanges in the international financial environment.''   It warns about moves to impose a European-wide withholding taxon interest income.   The European Commission, the EEC's executive body, unveiled aplan earlier this year for a minimum withholding rate of 15 percentthroughout the trading bloc. It was later scaled down to 10 percent.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
