The formation of dust will have immediateimplications on the spectral analysis of the ejecta, as the dust mayobscure the visual and UV output of any pulsar that may have formed inthe explosion. A roughly 20 solar mass progenitor star can produce about1 solar mass of supernova condensates. Supernovae will then constitutea major source of dust, equaling the combined output of all other sources.The detection of this dust in SN 1987A will be a significant additionto the incomplete picture we now have of the presence of isotopic anomaliesin the solar system, and of the origin and evolution of dust in the interstellarmedium. 36 references.</TEXT></DOC>
