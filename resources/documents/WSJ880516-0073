LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Centerre Bancorp., which last month agreed to be acquired by Mercantile Bancorp., said it &quot;would pursue discussions&quot; with Boatmen's Bancshares Inc., a rival suitor.    However, Centerre said it continues to be bound by the terms of its merger agreement with Mercantile, and that its board has &quot;no idea &quot; whether the discussions with Boatmen's will lead to a transaction.    Clarence C. Barksdale, Centerre's chairman and chief executive officer, cited fiduciary duty as the reason for the discussions with Boatmen's, and said the company continues to believe that &quot;the Mercantile transaction represents the best alternative for shareholders.&quot;    Mercantile offered to acquire Centerre in a stock transaction valued at $278 million. Boatmen's has proposed acquiring Centerre in a stock swap valued at about $390 million. All three concerns are St. Louis-based bank holding companies.    Meanwhile, a Centerre shareholder filed a suit in St. Louis County Circuit Court aimed at nullifying the company's shareholder rights plan, and preventing the merger with Mercantile. Mr. Barksdale called the filing a &quot;nuisance lawsuit.&quot;    Earlier this year, United Missouri Bancshares Inc. proposed acquiring Centerre in a stock swap valued at $262 million. Centerre rejected the proposal as inadequate. </TEXT></DOC>
