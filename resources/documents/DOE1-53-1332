The study was divided into two parts.The first part morphometrically characterized the temporal post-exposure(24 hour period) response of the rat nasal mucosa to a single intranasalinstillation of endotoxin (E), a chemotoxinogen for neutrophils. Thesecond part examined the direct effects of E and indirect effects ofinfiltrating neutrophils on nasal intraepithelial mucosubstances by preventingthe neutrophilic influx into the E-exposed nasal mucosa of the rat. Resultsof this study indicate that neutrophilic infiltration provides a stimulusfor increased mucous secretion from respiratory epithelium. A similarneutrophilic infiltration induced by an inhaled chemical irritant couldbe responsible in part for the characteristic hypersecretion of mucusin respiratory airways.</TEXT></DOC>
