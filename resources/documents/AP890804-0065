Allan Boesaksaid on behalf of the South African Council of Churches.   South Africa's tricameral Parliament has separate houses for the5 million whites, 3 million people of mixed race and a millionAsians, but excludes the 28 million-member black majority.   Protests began Wednesday when 270 blacks and Indians sought andreceived treatment at segregated white hospitals. There were noincidents despite government warnings the campaign will lead toviolence.   The Council of Churches, which includes almost all leadingProtestant denominations, said future protests ``will be initiatedby the church, others will be supported by the church.''   Churchmen said the new protests will be launched later thismonth but declined details.   Its supporters hope the defiance campaign will be the largestcivil disobedience action in South Africa since the 1950s. It hasbeen organized by the Mass Democratic Movement, a loose coalitionreplacing the United Democratic Front, which was the country'slargest anti-apartheid federation when it was banned last year.   Police made no attempt to confront protesters on Wednesday.Authorities have not said how they will respond in the future,though Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said such activities``are a time-bomb that could explode at any moment.''   Election campaigns in recent years have been marked by numerousbombings and there have been several attacks in the past two weeksin Johannesburg and Cape Town. The only fatality has been a manplanting a bomb that exploded on a Johannesburg railroad line.Several other people have been wounded.   No one has claimed responsibility, but police blame the outlawedAfrican National Congress guerrilla movement, which has called fora boycott of the mixed-race and Asian elections.   Also Friday, the church leaders condemned 16 British cricketplayers who have agreed to tour South Africa in 1990 and 1991.   ``I think it is an obscenity for them to come to South Africa atthis stage of our crisis,'' said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.   White South African sports officials have hailed the tour as amajor breakthrough in the international sports boycot imposed toprotest Pretoria's legal policy of race discrimination.</TEXT></DOC>
