About seven hours after pledging that the United States willkeep its troops in Europe ``as long as Europeans want them tostay,'' Reagan's Air Force Boeing 707 jetliner touched down on awindy, moonlit tarmac at Brussels Zaventem Airport.   He smiled and chatted amiably as he was greeted by Shultz, whohad just arrived from a meeting in London with Jordan's KingHussein. Also on hand was Belgium's prime minister, WilfriedMartens and Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans.   Following a five-minute courtesy get-together with Tindemans inan airport salon, Reagan was ferried by motorcade for an overnightstay at Chateau Stuyvenberg, a 1840 brick and stone palace one usedas the favored residence of the Belgium royal family.   Reagan, as he left the White House for a two-day NATO summit inBelgium, said the session comes at a historic moment for both Eastand West.   ``For four decades, the combination of a strong common defenseand pursuit of dialogue with the East has been a winning formulafor NATO,'' Reagan said. ``It is a combination that can lead us toa future of peace, freedom and prosperity for generations to come.''   A throng of teen-age participants in the White House Conferenceon a Drug-Free America, brought to the diplomatic entrance to giveReagan a sendoff, sang ``God Bless America'' as the presidentemerged.   Reagan attempted to calm allied fears that the U.S.-Soviettreaty banning medium-range nuclear missiles portends an Americanabandonment of its long-time commitment to the European democracies.   ``That historic agreement was possible because the alliance'ssteadfast political and military resolve backed up our negotiationswith the Soviets,'' Reagan said.   The NATO allies are also concerned that the force of 326,000U.S. troops stationed in Europe might be cut due to the U.S.economic budget crunch.   ``My Atlantic colleagues and I will rededicate ourselves tomaintaining the deterrent that has protected our freedom andprosperity for almost 40 years,'' Reagan said. ``I will repeat tomy colleagues my strong conviction that American troops will remainin Europe, under any administration, so long as Europeans want themto stay.''   As the first full-scale North Atlantic Treaty Organizationsummit since 1982, the meeting has been touted as a chance for the16-nation alliance to evaluate its goals and accentuate itssolidarity.   But the summit, Reagan said, will not be held for``self-congratulations.'' Instead, he said, it will be a time for arededication to the democratic goals that forged the alliance in1949 in the face of the spread of Soviet influence in EasternEurope.   ``If our common approach to the East over the years has givencoherence to our message of peace and world freedom, it has beenour unwavering commitment to defend ourselves that has given itcredibility,'' Reagan said. ``Arms reduction can only succeed if itis backed up by a strong defense.''   His first priority, Reagan said, ``is to maintain a strong andhealthy partnership between North America and Europe.''   Reagan pledged anew to forge ahead with attempts to achieve a 50percent cut in strategic nuclear arms, as well as a global ban onchemical weapons.   He asserted that he also intends to press the Soviets on humanrights violations and its ``external aggression, '' apparently areference to its involvement in nations such as Afghanistan andNicaragua.   The summit meeting comes as Reagan prepares for an expectedround of spring summitry with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,and as the allies must cope with the Soviet public relationscampaign that paints Gorbachev as a champion of peace and armscontrol.   For the most part, Reagan will appear only in brief photoopportunities at the NATO session. The meetings among the heads ofstate or government Wednesday and Thursday will be private.   Reagan is slated to deliver closing remarks on Thursday.   On Monday, Reagan previewed his slant on the summit in anaddress to the annual convention of the American Legion.   He promised to forge ahead with attempts to cut superpowerstrategic arsenals in half and to seek a ban on chemical weapons.But he also pledged that negotiations to reduce Warsaw Pactconventional forces will receive equal weight.   ``The serious imbalance of conventional forces in Europe must beaddressed as an equally high priority,'' Reagan said. ``Warsaw Pacttanks and artillery far outnumber our own. Ours are positioned fordefense, theirs for an offensive attack.''   Reagan attempted to sweep aside European doubts about America'swillingness to help its friends, but he advised that the alliancecannot stand still.   ``The Warsaw Pact's numerical superiority and the Sovietstrategy which emphasizes surprise attack means that our remainingnuclear forces are fully capable of supporting NATO's flexibleresponse strategy,'' Reagan said.   ``At the same time we must modernize our chemical weapons todeter Soviet first-use and we must provide for conventional forcesthat are capable of protecting free Europe,'' Reagan said.</TEXT></DOC>
