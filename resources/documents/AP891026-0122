WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   West Germany's ambassador to Polandhas resigned because of stress from the recent East German refugeeexodus and the upcoming visit of Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Warsaw,officials said Thursday.   Franz Joachim Schoeller has been granted early retirement aftercomplaining of exhaustion, said Foreign Ministry spokesman JuergenChrobog.   Chrobog denied rumors in Warsaw that Schoeller, 63, waspressured into resigning. ``That is absolutely untrue,'' saidChrobog.   But the West German visit to Poland _ the first by a federalchancellor in more than a decade _ and the moves towardreconciliation of the former World War II enemies has been anemotionally and politically charged issue for the Bonn leadership.   Chrobog said Schoeller cited ``the stress of recent times'' inasking to be allowed to go on pension on medical grounds.   Schoeller said he and the embassy staff had been overtaxed bypreparations for Kohl's Nov. 9-14 visit, and by the arrival ofseveral thousand East German refugees at the embassy.   At least 3,000 East Germans who escaped to Poland or refused toreturn from authorized trips appealed to the West German Embassy inWarsaw for help in emigrating, and were sheltered there and atother buildings at the disposal of the diplomats. About 2,000refugees remain in Warsaw awaiting the Bonn government's help ingetting to West Germany.   Chrobog declined to say who would replace Schoeller, but saidthe Polish government has agreed to a speedy succession because ofthe pending summit and the extra workload caused by the refugees.Well-informed sources in the Bonn government, who asked not to beidentified, said Schoeller would be replaced by the currentambassador to Chile, Guenter Knackstedt.   Schoeller, a career diplomat, had been ambassador to Poland fortwo years.   His resignation was effective immediately.   Under the government's pension system, officials can take earlyretirement for health reasons after age 62.   Kohl's trip to Poland had been put off repeatedly because ofdifferences between the two governments and the change inleadership in Poland this summer.   There had also been broad differences of opinion within the Bonnleadership coalition about the lengths to which West Germany shouldgo to reconcilewith Poland, whose invasion by Nazi Germany on Sept.1, 1939, touched off World War II. West Germany and Poland havenever signed a peace treaty.   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a member of the liberalFree Democratic Party that is the junior partner in the Bonncoalition, reportedly favored more generous offers of West Germanaid during the early stages of negotiations between the two nations.   Kohl, leader of the conservative Christian Democrats, put hissenior foreign affairs adviser, Horst Teltschik, in charge of thereconciliation talks, rather than leaving them to Genscher'sdiplomatic staff.   The talks stalled several times early this year and weresuspended during the leadership transition in Poland over thesummer.   A broad agreement resolving all outstanding problems betweenPoland and West Germany was reached on Oct. 3, clearing the way forKohl's visit.</TEXT></DOC>
