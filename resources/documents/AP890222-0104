A top PLO official said today the organization supportsestablishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, and he saidthe Palestinian charter calling for destruction of the Jewish stateis open to discussion.   The army sealed the Gaza Strip house of a man suspected ofhurling concrete blocks from his roof at troops, an army officialsaid. Troops also sealed rooms in three other Gaza Strip homes.   In the West Bank village of Beit Amin, residents discovered in awell the body of a man accused of cooperating with Israeliauthorities. Muhammad Abed Suleiman, 25, disappeared two months agoand residents believe he was killed by fellow Palestinians. An armyofficial said he was investigating the report.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has said more than 60 suspectedcollaborators have been killed by fellow Palestinians since theDecember 1987 start of the uprising. In all, 384 Palestinians and 16Israelis have died in the revolt against Israel's occupation of theWest Bank and Gaza Strip.   A leaflet distributed by the underground Unified NationalLeadership of the Uprising called for a ``day of confrontations''with troops today to mark the 1969 founding of the MarxistDemocratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radicalPalestine Liberation Organization faction led by Nayef Hawatmeh.   Israel radio reported troops were put on alert.   Four people wounded in today's protests were hurt in a clash thatoccurred when soldiers raided West Bank villages north of Jerusalemand rounded up dozens of suspects, an Arab reporter said. Hospitalofficials confirmed the reports of wounded, and said the youngestshot was a 13-year-old boy.   Three other Palestinians were shot and wounded when troops firedon students hurling rocks at them in Gaza's Jebaliya and Shatirefugee camps, an Arab reporter said.   An army spokesman said he was checking the reports.   He said troops sealed three rooms in three homes in Gaza'sAbassan village. They belong to Palestinians accused of setting fireto a municipal council building to protest a visit by militarypersonnel, he said.   Two of the homes only had two rooms, meaning half the house wasblocked off. A family of five lived in one, and an eight-memberfamily lived in the other.   During a peace symposium in Jerusalem, a videotape was shown ofSalah Khalaf, Yasser Arafat's No. 2 man.   Khalaf, known by his nom de guerre Abu Iyad, assured his audiencethe PLO recognizes Israel and deplores violence and said: ``We havearrived at a truth that we hope the Israeli leaders will arrive atbefore it is too late. This is the truth which says that two peoplesand two states must coexist in this land,'' Khalaf said in theaddress.   ``All other matters are open to discussion, our covenant andyours can be discussed,'' Khalaf said.   The convenant refers to the Palestinian National Charter.</TEXT></DOC>
