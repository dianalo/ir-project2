When liftoff of the spacecraft was delayed, engineers in launchcontrol at Cape Canaveral announced that though the shuttle couldbe launched as late 2:30 p.m. EDT, there were two brief periodsthat were restricted because of satellites passing near Discovery'sflight path.   Officials at the Johnson Space Center said they received aCollision Avoidance warning from the Air Force Missile Command,which keeps track of the hundreds of satellites in orbit.   Flight Director Gary Coen said the warning had no effect on theDiscovery mission because the shuttle was launched at 11:37 a.m.EDT, almost a half hour before the first of the two resticted times.   Coen said the satellites that triggered the warnings were notidentifed by the Air Force.</TEXT></DOC>
