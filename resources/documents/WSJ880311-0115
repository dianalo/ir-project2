Klein </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> Clearwater, Fla.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rich Ashburn has made a bit or two of baseball history, but one, rare distinction eluded him. If he had joined the Baseball Writers' Association of America while he was writing a sports column for the Philadelphia Bulletin a dozen years ago, he would have been the only former player ever to be able to vote for himself for membership in the game's Hall of Fame.    &quot;The Bulletin never put me up for the writers' association, and I never made an issue of it,&quot; explained the former centerfielder, tanned and fit-looking at age 60, in the Phillies' spring camp here, which he is attending as a member of the club's broadcasting unit. &quot;I'm a member now that I write for the {Philadelphia} Daily News, but it's been more than 25 years since I retired as a player, so now it's up to the Veterans' Committee to vote on me for the Hall.&quot;    Still, Ashburn noted that his multifaceted career has positioned him for an even more noteworthy mention in the national pastime's books. &quot;I stand to be the only man ever to be rejected for the Hall in three categories: player, broadcaster and writer,&quot; he said with what I think was a smile.    It is no particular knock on Ashburn's journalistic talents to opine that his best shot at the Hall is as a player. In his 15 seasons in the bigs ending in 1962, 12 of them with the Phils, he established himself as baseball's pestiest batsman, compiling 2,574 hits, 1,198 walks and a .308 lifetime batting average. Twice -- in 1955 and '58 -- he led the National League in hitting. He is the only player to retire in this century with more than 2,500 hits and a lifetime .300 batting mark and not gain election to Cooperstown.    He did something else that ought, by itself, to qualify him for immortality. He quit while he was ahead. In 1962, his last season, he batted .306 in 135 games for the newborn New York Mets. That made him the last player of substantial tenure to hit .300 in his final Major League campaign.    &quot;I was only 35 years old, and could have played for a few more seasons, but the Mets were so lousy I couldn't see any point to it,&quot; he said. &quot;That team is looked upon as colorful now, but then it was just bad with little hope for quick improvement. I'd played with enough bad teams in Philadelphia and Chicago to not want any more of that.&quot;    Ashburn is a native of Nebraska, and had planned to return to that state to farm or go into business when his playing days ended. Instead, he heeded a call that he try his hand as a broadcast &quot;color&quot; man in Philadelphia. This is his 26th season in that post.    &quot;A friend of mine, Les Quailey, worked for the ad agency that put together the Phillies' radio-television package,&quot; Ashburn said. &quot;He gave me the job and stuck with me, even though I really wasn't very good at first. He also gave me the best piece of advice I ever had. He told me that if I didn't have anything to say, not to say it. Radio and TV sports would be a lot better if everyone in it did that.&quot;    Ex-jocks are numerous in sports broadcasting, but Ashburn's status as a newspaper columnist is unusual. Only a small handful of former big league ballplayers have chosen the rigors of writing for a post-diamond career, most notably ex-first baseman Tim Murnane, a Boston Globe writer and editor of 60 or so years ago, and Stan Baumgartner, who pitched in the 1910s and '20s and later covered baseball for the Philadelphia Inquirer.    Ashburn owed his initial newspaper job to his celebrity as a sportscaster. &quot;In 1972, the Bulletin was running ghost-written columns by a couple of athletes, and asked me to sign one, too,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I told them I was no Hemingway, but that I'd been decent in English in school and would try writing it myself. I did, and they liked it. Every piece of mine that's been in the Bulletin or the Daily News, I wrote myself.&quot;    Ashburn's column, which has been running in the Daily News since 1982, appears Tuesdays and Thursdays in the paper's sports pages. He's no Hemingway or, even, Jim Murray, but, then, who is? It's mostly about sports, but he occasionally indulges in personal ruminations. Last month he wrote about getting a traffic ticket in Clearwater and wondered, as have we all in similar circumstances, why the cops bothered with him while dangerous criminals were at large. The column was picked up by a Clearwater newspaper, &quot;making me the most notorious Florida lawbreaker since Ted Bundy,&quot; Ashburn observed.    Usually, Ashburn is low-key behind microphone or typewriter, expounding on baseball's personalities or fine points. Although he says he prefers the Phillies to play well because it makes living with them easier, he is neither cheerleader nor controversialist, reasoning that benign neutrality wears best.    He is, however, outspoken on a number of subjects, including what he sees as the ignorance of basic skills of present-day players. &quot;The Major Leagues have expanded while the minors have shrunk, meaning players don't get the training they used to,&quot; he said between puffs on his ever-present pipe. &quot;Take 'defensive hitting.' When I played, everyone understood that when a batter had two strikes on him, he choked up on his bat, shortened his swing and just tried to make contact with the ball. Even power hitters like Musial and Clemente did it. You mention that today, and the players just shrug. Never heard of it.&quot;    He is no less clear on the subject of his exclusion from the Hall of Fame: &quot;Not being in it bothers me because I deserve it; just look at my record, and the fact I accomplished it in the 1950s, which I consider the game's best-played era. I didn't hit a lot of home runs, but show me where it says an outfielder has to do that to qualify?&quot;    But if Hall electors don't love Ashburn, the folks in Clearwater and Philly do. At Russell Field here he is besieged for autographs and his ears are bent relentlessly by people, mostly older ones, who want to share baseball memories. Unfailingly, he obliges. &quot;I guess I've become an institution before being forced to enter one,&quot; he said. &quot;There's something to be said for that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
