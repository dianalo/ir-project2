Dozens of the estimated 5,000 radicals were injured or detainedwhen 6,000 riot troopers charged them, but police had no figures oninjuries or arrests.   The demonstrators chanting ``Yankee go home!'' and ``Down withRoh Tae-woo!'' were trying to reach the headquarters of thegoverning Democratic Justice Party.   Troopers in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmetsblocked the march and retaliated with tear gas when some protestersthrew firebombs and rocks to try to force their way.   The riot police charged the protesters, forcing many to fleedownstairs into subway stations where some were trampled or hit bypeople leaping from above.   Police beat and kicked groups of protesters who were surroundedby the charging security forces. Other protesters hurled scores offirebombs, and some police were beaten to the ground by radicalsusing clubs and fists.   ``You are the enemies of our people!'' an enraged man yelled atpolice.   Clashes continued for more than an hour along one of Seoul's mainshopping avenues. Hundreds of terrified pedestrians ran to escapethe fighting and clouds of tear gas.   Demonstrators repeatedly called for removal of the 42,000 U.S.troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.   An effigy representing Roh, President Bush and top Koreanindustrialists was burned during the march. The rally before themarch also demanded an end to controls on labor unions.   The protest was the first action organized by a new dissidentalliance, the National Coalition for a Democratic Movement, whichwas formed Saturday by about 20 dissident, labor and student groups.   Coalition leaders said it was the largest dissident group everformed in South Korea and claimed a membership of 30,000 people.   Coalition leaders pledged to seek the fall of the Roh government,charging it is a front for military rule. The coalition also calledfor an end to South Korea's powerful industrial conglomerates and toall foreign influence.   The coalition claims it will launch a movement of students,workers and farmers to remove Roh and create a ``society ofequality'' for workers and the poor.   Lee Bu-young, a leader of the new group, said, ``Since theorganization is based on grass-roots groups, it will be able toresist any government oppression and struggle for nationaldevelopment.''   Formation of a similar dissident alliance in May 1987 was a keyevent in sparking major anti-government protests that forced theauthoritarian government of President Chun Doo-hwan to agree todemocratic presidential elections.   Roh won the election, and his government has introduced broaddemocratic reforms. Radicals refuse to accept that there have beendemocratic reforms and claim the nation is still ruled by themilitary and powerful industrialists.   The radicals appear to lack substantial public support, but theirviolent protests make them a powerful force in domestic politics.Roh warned last week that radicals were a threat to politicalstability and ordered a harsh crackdown.</TEXT></DOC>
