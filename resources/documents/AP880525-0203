Spokesman Charles Redman said Vietnamese Foreign Minister NguyenCo Thatch sent a May 23 message through the U.S. Embassy inBangkok, Thailand, asking for a meeting with U.S. presidentialenvoy retired Army Gen. John Vessey.   Vessey held talks with Vietnamese officials in Hanoi last yearon stepping up efforts to find some 2,500 Americans missing inaction from the Indochinese war.   Contacts with Vietnam, which does not have diplomatic relationswith the United States, have been sporadic in recent years. TheUnited States has adopted a policy of isolating Vietnameconomically and diplomatically in order to pressure the Hanoigovernment into ending its 10-year military occupation of Cambodia.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz sent a letter last month toThatch welcoming Vietnam's release of hundreds of prisoners fromso-called re-education camps in September 1987 and February 1988,Redman said.   But Shultz's letter also expressed ``our concern about the fateof these prisoners because of their association with us and theformer Saigon government,'' Redman said.   The former Vietnamese officials and loyalists were placed inprison camps after Communist North Vietnam defeated U.S.-backedSouth Vietnam in 1975.   Shultz asked Thatch to discuss resettlement of the releasedprisoners in the United States, a move which ``reflects ourcontinuing concern for the welfare of our former allies,'' Redmanadded.   Slightly more than 1,000 political prisoners were freed inFebruary 1988, and Vietnamese officials have assured the UnitedStates that fewer than 150 people remain in re-education camps,said a State Department official.   The official, who asked not to be named, said some 900,000Vietnamese had undergone short-term or long-term ``re-education''since 1975. He said only a handful of those who were released fromthe camps have come to the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
