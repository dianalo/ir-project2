The Pentagon initially viewed the halt in payments, announced Friday, as a bold stroke, coming on the heels of the unsealing of court documents suggesting that nine of the Navy's electronics programs had been sullied by influence-peddling and the sale of inside information. Yesterday, however, some Pentagon officials were describing the action as &quot;hasty&quot; and looking for a way to undo it.    The problem is that the Defense Department lacks evidence on whether the contractors working on the projects did anything illegal. Navy officials spent much of the July 4 weekend poring over official procurement records on the equipment. Not surprisingly, they didn't find records of bribes or bid-rigging.    Nor is the Pentagon likely to get information in the near future on possible irregularities in the procurement process. The Justice Department says it needs months more to build a case against defense consultants suspected of bribing Pentagon workers or bending the procurement process to the advantage of one or another contractor. Pentagon officials complain that law enforcement officials aren't sharing many of the findings from their nationwide investigation with the military.    Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said that the payments-freeze was in force &quot;until further notice.&quot; But one official closer to the procurement machinery volunteered: &quot;We're pretty close to the end of it.&quot;    The move to stop payments came after members of Congress charged that the Defense Department had neither cracked down on contractors nor cleaned up the procurement system. A reversal would likely spark a new chorus of those charges.    Normally, the Pentagon suspends contractors only after they've been indicted or convicted of procurement fraud. Typically, such contractors are reinstated once the government has been convinced that the abuses won't be repeated. But Friday's halt in payments came even before prosecutors have sifted through all the evidence gathered from subpoenas, wiretaps and searches. Thus, Pentagon officials fear, the halt could put the programs on hold for months.    Moreover, according to reports inside the department, procurement officials have voiced worries that the freeze might provoke a slew of breach-of-contract suits. There is also concern that the action could set a tough precedent to follow: as future affidavits are released by courts, it would be consistent for the Pentagon to freeze payments on those jobs as well. But while the electronics contracts subject to Friday's action total about $1 billion, the 85 or so contracts covered by the entire investigation run in the tens of billions of dollars.    Also, a more sweeping action could tie up significant Navy programs touched by the scandal, including the advanced tactical aircraft and the electronics systems for the Aegis cruiser.    The biggest project covered by the halt in payments involves developing a new Anti-Submarine Warfare Operating Center for the Navy, a complex of on-shore communications stations to support submarine operations. The Navy contracts on the system, valued at $712 million, have been awarded to TRW Inc., Unisys Corp., and what Navy officials estimate to be as many as 100 smaller contractors.    Lifting the payments-ban probably won't prevent delays in some of the frozen programs. In cases where no contracts have yet been awarded, the Pentagon is likely to delay final decisions while the investigation continues.    For example, the Navy is holding off a decision on giving any company the $118 million job of developing new air-defense communications centers for the Marine Corps. That project, known as Advanced Tactical Air Command Central, was mentioned extensively in the court papers released last week.    According to one government affidavit, George Stone, a Navy purchasing official, furnished consultant Mark Saunders sensitive information on the bidding for the air-command job. Mr. Saunders allegedly passed the information on to another consultant, Thomas Muldoon, who the government says is working for Norden Systems, a United Technologies Corp. unit that was considered a prime contender for the contract.    Attorneys for Messrs. Saunders and Muldoon have said that their clients didn't do anything improper, and Mr. Stone's attorney has declined to comment.    Any Pentagon action to resume payments to contractors wouldn't remove the cloud over the programs. And if individuals involved are later indicted or convicted, the department could again impose a suspension of payments.    The Pentagon hasn't decided what steps it should take if there are convictions involving militarily important weapons systems already being produced. It may be impractical to reopen bidding for such contracts. One option being considered would be to force the contractors involved to forgo any profits on jobs shown to have been won through inside information or bid-rigging. That way, the Navy would get the equipment it ordered without rewarding contractors for wrongdoing in the procurement process.    ---                      Suspended Job Bids                          CONTRACT PROJECT                (In millions)   COMPANY ATACC: Communications      $118        Contract not awarded;   Equipment                            Norden considered                                        lead contender MRC 139: Radio Set           49        Loral, Terracom,                                        Canadian Marconi DCT: Communications         150        Litton   Terminal Fiber Optic Equipment        51        ITT   Switches andamp; Radios BANCROFT: Radio              30        Contract not awarded;                                        Gould considered                                        lead contender ASWOC: Shore-Based          712        TRW, Unisys   Command Control   Centers TESS: Oceanographic          58        Lockheed   Computer Systems UYQ-21: Aviation Displays    38        Hughes, Raytheon VLF/LF Communications         6.3      Continental   Systems                              Electronics and                                        other contractors Source: Defense Department</TEXT></DOC>
