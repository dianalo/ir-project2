Producers hoped the charity preview would generate support for acommercial engagement of the play.   ``I feel numb,'' Martin Smith, the composer-librettist of``King,'' said following the audience response to his musical inits premiere at the Prince Edward Theater.   The musical, which portrays the life of the Nobel Prize-winningblack minister, began 20 minutes late because of a bomb scare. Butit proceeded without incident, except for some minor technicalmishaps with video projections.   Smith, a 30-year-old Scot who started work on ``King'' fiveyears ago, said of the reception, ``It was wonderful. You couldn'task for more.''   More than 60 percent of the tickets were sold for theperformance at the 1,616-seat theater.   Obba Babatunde, a New Yorker who won a 1982 Tony Award for``Dreamgirls,'' received the lion's share of the cheers for hisportrayal of the Dr. King, who was assassinated April 4, 1968, inMemphis, Tennessee.   The 75 cast members and 24 musicians worked without pay for theconcert, which was expected to raise $18,700 for two charities: theTerence Higgins trust, devoted to AIDS research in Britain, and theSave the Children Fund.   Although reference was made to King's most celebrated speeches,his actual words were not spoken on-stage in accordance withcopyright laws.   Smith said the King family had instead given its approval to asecond English musical on the slain leader, which is due to beproduced on New York's Broadway within the year.</TEXT></DOC>
