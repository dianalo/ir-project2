For the three tobacco companies involved, the direct financial stakes are all but irrelevant. Liggett Group Inc., Philip Morris Inc. and Loews Corp.'s Lorillard Inc. unit are spending millions of dollars to defend themselves in a suit brought by Antonio Cipollone, whose wife Rose, a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer in 1984. But even if a loss here triggers a torrent of new lawsuits and unfavorable verdicts, these, all told, would add only a few cents to the price of a pack of cigarettes, analysts estimate.    &quot;In the worst-case disaster scenario, a very small price increase could pay the bill forever,&quot; says Roy Burry, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    At stake in Newark's federal court is not dollars and cents, but the image and clout of three companies and a beleaguered industry. Calvert Crary, a liability expert at Martin Simpson andamp; Co., says the &quot;most important consequence&quot; of an industry defeat in the Cipollone case would be to cause tobacco manufacturers' &quot;political base to erode even further.&quot; This, the industry fears, would make it more vulnerable to unfavorable legislation such as advertising bans.    Even if the tobacco companies prevail, as many expect they will, they have sustained serious public-relations blows over the course of the four-month trial. For the first time, the three cigarette makers have been forced to make public thousands of pages of confidential documents. These suggest that tobacco companies had long ago privately acknowleged what they today still publicly deny: that smoking is linked to cancer and other diseases. The evidence also suggests that the manufacturers sought to suppress research results on smoking and health and to undercut the impact of scientific findings by generating controversy in the press and medical community over the real causes of lung cancer.    All three cigarette makers face allegations of fraudulently representing that cigarettes weren't a health hazard when they knew they were, and of conspiracy. All the allegations relate exclusively to the companies' activities before 1966, when the surgeon general forced the industry to put warnings on cigarette packs. Liggett, the central defendant in the case, faces additional claims because Mrs. Cipollone smoked only its cigarettes before 1966. Those claims include a failure to warn of smoking's dangers despite company research showing the risk. The plaintiff also contends that Liggett offered an &quot;express warranty&quot; that cigarettes were safe by touting L andamp; M's in the early 1950s as &quot;just what the doctor ordered.&quot;    The tobacco industry has lost none of the 319 liability suits filed against manufacturers since 1954. But at a time when smoking is under fire, the defense acknowledges it is concerned the plaintiff may win this landmark case if the stacks of incriminating evidence lead the jury to ponder broader questions about the industry's legitimacy and corporate responsibility.    The defense hopes the jury instead will focus on whether the industry's conduct played a substantial role in Mrs. Cipollone's specific decision to smoke and in her specific illness.    &quot;You aren't the conscience of the community but the judges of the fact,&quot; Peter Bleakley, the lawyer for Philip Morris, told the jury in his closing arguments Thursday. In a subsequent interview, Mr. Bleakley stressed: &quot;The only thing moving the odds a little closer is the current unpopularity of smoking.&quot;    In Judge H. Lee Sarokin's most recent draft of instructions, which is expected to be given to the jury on Tuesday, he wrote: &quot;Although the acts of the defendants need not be the sole or main cause of Mrs. Cipollone's starting or continuing to smoke, it must be a substantial contributing factor in those injuries. . . . It is also the plaintiff's burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that any or all of Rose Cipollone's smoking was a proximate cause of her developing lung cancer and her death.&quot;    To prove his case, Marc Z. Edell, the plaintiff's attorney, faces several key challenges, say experts following the trial. In closing arguments today, Mr. Edell must convince jurors that not only did the industry make misrepresentations in its advertising and public relations, but that Mrs. Cipollone relied on them.    He will also have to convince them that the cigarettes Mrs. Cipollone smoked before 1966 were a substantial factor in the lung cancer she developed in 1981. To make that link, Mr. Edell has maintained Mrs. Cipollone was dependent on tobacco and couldn't quit. The argument is bolstered by the recent surgeon general's report terming tobacco as addictive as heroin. But some experts say the addiction argument could also work against the plaintiff. Forty million Americans, including some members of the jury, have kicked the habit.    One of the defense's main strategies has been to portray Mrs. Cipollone as a well-informed, intelligent woman who smoked because she enjoyed it and was aware of the risks from the start. In his closing arguments Wednesday, Donald Cohn, Liggett's attorney, recalled an interview Mrs. Cipollone had with the plaintiff's addiction witness. She told Dr. Jerome H. Jaffe, director of research at the National Institute of Drug Abuse, that she didn't want to &quot;hear&quot; the first surgeon general's report. &quot;I liked to smoke, I liked the way it looked. It gave me something to do,&quot; she explained.    But Mr. Edell has argued that Mrs. Cipollone heard conflicting messages about the hazards of her habit. In a deposition read to the court in April, Mrs. Cipollone said she was initially attracted to smoking because of its seductive connotations of Hollywood and glamour. The cigarette makers' advertisements reinforced these perceptions and others of the product's safety, the plaintiff contends.    Mr. Edell's undisputed success in the court of public opinion may not translate into a victory in the courtroom. &quot;With all those documents, he may well have convinced the public and the jury that the tobacco people are bad people,&quot; says Victor Schwartz, a Washington, D.C.-based product liability specialist. But Mr. Schwartz contends: &quot;The plaintiff hasn't made a case that shows whatever the defendants did or didn't do really made any difference with this particular plaintiff.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
