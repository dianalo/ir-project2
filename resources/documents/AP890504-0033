A federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted two men, includingformer Barry adviser David E. Rivers, on charges they conspired toaward $3 million in city health services contracts to friends.   Rivers and prominent city contractor John B. Clyburn wereindicted after they allegedly worked to secure several citycontracts for a company headed by undercover FBI agents, gave othercontracts to friends and assigned still others to a company Clyburnowned.   Rivers also faces two counts of agreeing to accept a bribe,while Clyburn has been charged with helping to bribe him.   Barry, already under federal investigation for his ties to adrug suspect, said in a prepared statement, ``My focus continues tobe on managing the District of Columbia government.''   Compounding Barry's difficulties are a growing drug-relatedcrime wave and the possibility that Jesse Jackson, Barry's longtimecivil rights ally, might move to the nation's capital and run formayor in 1990.   Prosecutors provided no details on how money from the allegedcontract steering ended up in Barry's 1986 reelection campaignfund, but a source familiar with Barry's 1986 campaign told TheAssociated Press that Rivers and Clyburn organized at least onefund-raiser for Barry's 1986 campaign.   The indictments come after a 21-month grand jury probe thatfollowed a 17-month undercover FBI investigation into the city'scontracting procedures.   If convicted of all charges, Rivers and Clyburn could each facemaximum prison terms of 50 years.   ``This indictment alleged a seamy web of corruption, ofconcealment, of manipulation and of self-dealing by one of the mostsenior officials in the District of Columbia government,'' saidU.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens.   Stephens alleged that both Clyburn and Rivers took ``about 10percent off the top'' in kickbacks for the 20 contracts andcontract extensions mentioned in the indictment.   Rivers was out of town Wednesday, said his attorney, John Mercer.   The 49-page indictment charges that the alleged contractingscheme took place from 1983 through May 1987.   Rivers took a leave of absence from his city job in August 1987after he became a target of the investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
