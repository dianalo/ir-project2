Samples, preparedby calcination in various carbon dioxide concentrations at 900 degreeC for 16 hours, were exposed to sulphur dioxide at 850 degree C. Underthese conditions, no effect of carbon dioxide concentration on the sorbentutilization was observed. Samples prepared by calcination in variouscarbon dioxide concentrations at 900 degree C were directly exposed tosulphur dioxide at 850 degree C. These samples showed a slightly improvedsorbent utilization at higher carbon dioxide concentrations (i.e. atlow calcination rates). In addition, samples of the limestone calcinedin a tube furnace under 15 percent CO/sub 2/ in N/sub 2/ at 850 degreeC were exposed to various SO/sub 2/ concentrations. The results showeda somewhat greater sulphur dioxide absorption capacity at higher SO/sub2/ concentrations.</TEXT></DOC>
