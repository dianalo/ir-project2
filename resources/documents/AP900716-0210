That means curtains, bed linens, table linens, wallcoverings,rugs, carpets, and those old standbys, slipcovers and decoratorpillows.   Teflon, often associated with pots and presidents, now isprotecting fabrics from soil and stains. The Du Pont process isbeing used by makers of fabrics who supply both furnituremanufacturers and home decorators.   Among these are Waverly's classics in its New Traditions II line_ the Jacobean ``Marlborough'' with an accompanying allover floral``Montchanin,'' or the leafy ``Malvern'' and the coordinatingstripe ``Kennett.'' Bloomcraft has a collection of designs inspiredby fabrics and wallcoverings from the Louvre _ a medallion floralaccompanied by a Chinoiserie stripe, an allover floral, and a vineand scrolled mini, all in a brilliant lacquer red. Anju Woodridgeoffers a large Indian-motif medallion, ``Morgan,'' and itscoordinating stripe, ``MonteCristo.''   Shower curtains that have been Teflon-treated are being givenfull-scale decorator treatments with balloon and swag valances,embroidery, ruffles, appliques, pleats and borders. The departurefrom ordinary ring-and-hang curtains may owe to the characteristicsof the treated fabrics, which repel soapy water, spilled shampoosand lotions, and discourage mildew. Many of the fabric designs arematched with those used in the bedroom, and accessories such assink skirts, window curtains, towels, lid covers and rugs can becoordinated. Floral prints against black backgrounds, animal-skinpatterns, and paisleys are being used to form a richer palette thanthat used in traditional bathrooms and bedrooms.   The unified bed-and-bath concept is exemplified in the newestBill Blass for Springmaid collection. Five new patterns by thedesigner _ ``Castleton,'' ``Petit Point Stripe,'' ``Stanhope,''``Montgomery'' and ``Riande'' _ are being marketed in sheets,comforters, bedskirts, shams, spreads, draperies, decorativepillows, towels and shower curtains. According to Springmaid, thiscollection celebrates the 20th anniversary of its collaborationwith Blass, who was the first ``name'' designer to branch out intohome furnishings lines.   The ensemble approach also applies to Springmaid's designs byLynn Hollyn, a designer whose European country look coordinates butdoes not exactly match. The Lynn Hollyn at Home Collection featuresrugs from Masterlooms in the designer's muted pallette thatcoordinates with the bedlinen line and throws from The ThreeWeavers. These area rugs are her versions of classic patterns _``Oxford Quarters,'' ``Secret Garden,'' and ``Swedish Hearth,''among them.   Bordering and inset designs in wall-to-wall carpeting are partof a new trend toward using the floor as a distinct architecturalelement. Lighter colors can be used with more frequency since muchcarpeting is now treated, like the fabrics, to resist stains anddirt. Combined styles for custom-design looks might includemedallions, area stripes, borders, and other designs. Many of thesewill be found with Du Pont's Stainmaster label.   For a final soft touch, the home decorator can have designerneedlepoint pillows. Mario Buatta, known for his mastery of Englishcountry design, has teamed with Thimbelina, the makers ofneedlepoint designs and products, for his interpretations oftraditional motifs _ King Charles Spaniels, cabbage roses andfruits, available in kits or finished pillows.</TEXT></DOC>
