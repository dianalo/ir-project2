The theoretical modelis based on standard theory of segmented labour markets. Increased nominalwages in the petroleum sector will unambiguously increase the wage leveland the rate of unemployment. Increased petroleum employment will underrealistic assumptions also raise the wage level. The effect on the rateof unemployment in this case is ambiguous. The empirical model is embeddedin reduced forms of the theoretical model and the estimated parametersare cosistent with the theoretical results.</TEXT></DOC>
