Official Makes Peace With Senate Committee</HEAD><BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Elliott Abrams, the assistant secretary ofstate who has been persona non grata in the Senate ForeignRelations Committee since it was revealed he lied about secret U.S.efforts to resupply Nicaragua's Contra rebels, has made peace withthe panel's chairman.   In a letter to Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., Abrams apologizedfor ``misleading'' testimony he gave the committee on Oct. 10, 1986.   Abrams noted in a March 31 letter to Pell that he previously hadapologized to the House Intelligence Committee for similarinaccurate responses to questions about U.S. involvement in aprivate Contra aid network and about enlisting foreign governmentsto aid the rebels.   Recalling the Foreign Relations hearing, Abrams said, ``Mytestimony that day covered much of this same territory, andaccordingly, I want to offer you and through you the members of thecommittee the same apology.''   On Wednesday, Pell sent a two-sentence letter to Abrams saying,``Your apology is accepted'' and concluding: ``I look forward toyour working again with the committee on important Latin Americanissues.''   During last year's Iran-Contra hearings, it was disclosed thatAbrams' testimony had been wrong. At one point, Abrams toldinvestigators he didn't level with Congress because he was notauthorized to tell the truth.   From then on, Abrams _ the administration's chief spokesman onWestern Hemisphere matters as assistant secretary forinter-American affairs _ ran into credibility problems on CapitolHill. Some committees forced him to take an oath of truthfulnessbefore permitting him to testify, and the Foreign Relations panelplaced a flat ban on any appearances.   Members of Congress complained bitterly that Abrams' performanceillustrated an aid-at-any-price attitude on the part of theadministration and said they no longer could trust theadministration on anything having to do with Nicaragua policy.   In an incident March 17, Abrams sought to attend anadministration briefing for senators on a Nicaraguan-Honduranborder incident and was turned away at the door of the Capitolmeeting room by Senate aides.</TEXT></DOC>
