The proposed revision would revise the TechnicalSpecifications Table 3.3.3-3, Emergency Core Cooling System Response Times,for Item No. 4, High Pressure Coolant Injection System (HPCI), from lessthan or equal to 27 seconds to less than or equal to 35 seconds. This revisionwould provide Hope Creek Generating Station (HCGS) with flexibility inmeeting their requirement for a HPCI cold quick start time without excessivesystem tuning. The proposed changes do not increase the probability orconsequences of accidents since the accident scenarios which utilize theHPCI system: (1) Have never been limiting events, and (2) do not pose thepossibility of becoming limiting events as a result of the change. In addition,the proposed change does not affect the limiting peak cladding temperaturevalues nor reduce the reactor vessel water level below Level 1 during afeedwater transient. No changes are being made in the types of any effluentsthat may be released offsite, and there is no signficant increase in theallowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly,the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significantradiological environmental impact.With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed changeto the TS involves systems located within the restricted area as definedin 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluentsand has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant non-radiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forPrior Hearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 21, 1988 (53 FR 41430). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to interene was filed following thisnotice.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statements for the Hope Creek Generating Station,dated August, 1983.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated August 13, 1987 and a supplement dated August 12, 1988which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public DocumentRoom, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC and at the Pennsville Public Library,190 S.
