 They expressed concern about the rise ofclient-server computing and the prevalence of relational systems...andP;  ...Wasit time, they wondered, to move to a relational system?andP;  After politelytelling them that if they didn't, they were headed down an evolutionarydead-end, someone plaintively asked me, &quot;How do I know that in three or fouryears there won't be another grand new technology we should have moved to?&quot;andO;This article elaborates on my answer.andP;  I spoke vendors to get theirperspectives on the future.andP;  Surprisingly, they're in reasonably closeagreement.andM;Until the mid-'80s, database management systems were in what Thomas Kuhn(author of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) would call apreparadigmatic phase.andP;  DBMS vendors proposed ad hoc data managementsolutions based on a variety of insights and uses.andP;  Virtually each DBMS had adifferent architecture, each with some good features, each appropriate tosome application.andP;  But none were good enough to become an accepted standard.andO;The major attempt of the mainframe world, the CODASYL DBMSs, met with limitedsuccess.andM;In the microcomputer arena software developers were trying to create ablockbuster product that would be as easy to use as pfs:File and asfunctional as dBASE.andP;  Vendors discovered the magic of words like 'relational'and &quot;SQL,&quot; and freely attached them to software regardless of accuracy.andP;  Itwas clear that a DBMS had to be called relational to succeed in the market.andM;Refining the modelandM;The past 10 years have moved the relational model from abstract, academic,and experimental to accepted and basic.andP;  The relational model is today'sparadigm; its accepted dogma.andP;  The consensus is that the next five to 10years will see this paradigm refined-better implementations, fasterperformance, new functions, and extensions to address new problems.andM;E.F.andP;  Codd developed the relational model 20 years ago, establishing a newway of thinking about data management and building applications.andP;  This April,Codd published a new book about 'the second version' of the relational model.andO;He extends the number of attributes necessary to be called relational fromthe current 15 to over 300.andP;  The additional attributes don't change thefundamental meanings of the current set, which specifies how data looks tothe user and the criteria for a language to manipulate the data.andP;  Rather,they reflect what we've learned about using the relational model andencompass other aspects of a whole system.andM;To clearly see the future of the relational model, it's worthwhile tounderstand the technical implications.andM;What's relational mean?andM;Three key elements define a relational DBMS.andP;  First, the data is structuredas tables and only tables.andP;  &quot;Only&quot; is as important as  tables,&quot; becausethere's only one logical data structure that contains information.andP;  That'sdifferent from most DBMSs 20 years ago, when there were multiple structuressuch as record types and relationships between record types.andP;  Such systemsrequired the database creator to specify the entities in the database andrelationships between entities at design time.andP;  Once the data structure wasdefined, it was difficult to change in most DBMS implementations.andP;  This madedatabase administration more complex, and applications less flexible.andM;The second element of a relational system is a relationally completelanguage.andP;  This means the language must be able to do any operation thatrelational algebra or calculus can do.andP;  Further, the language should operateon tables instead of individual rows.andP;  SQL's a relationally completelanguage.andM;By themselves these criteria aren't very restrictive.andP;  Virtually anything canbe a relational database by this standard, particularly if you're not toofussy, about having the language operate on tables.andP;  This lack of precisionallowed early systems to claim to be &quot;more relational&quot; than competitors.andM;However, a third element was added that almost no system fulfilled.andP;  Thiselement required a relational DBMS to support certain integrity rules.andP;  Onerule said each row in a table must have a unique identifier (called theprimary key).andP;  The other integrity rules encompass referential integrity.andO;This means that foreign keys (columns in one table that reference the primarykey of another table) must match existing values of the primary key.andP;  Forexample, suppose customer Jones, whose CNUM is 12345, places an order.andP;  Whathappens if the data entry clerk enters 12354 instead? It wouldn't do to storean order for a non-existent customer.andP;  This part of referential integrity issometimes referred to as referential constraints.andM;Furthermore, referential integrity also means that a referential action mustbe specified.andP;  Referential actions mean any changes to a primary key must bereflected in the rest of the database.andP;  What happens to customer orders if Idelete the CUSTOMER record? The CNUM referenced by rows in the ORDER tablewill no longer exist.andP;  Should I delete the order (called cascading deletes)or prohibit the deletion of the customer record (called restricted deletes)?andO;Suppose I change the customer number of a CUSTOMER.andP;  I then need to changeall foreign keys referencing that CNUM.andM;Contrary to popular belief integrity was supported prior to relational DBMSs.andO;It was implicit in older DBMSs like IMS, IDMS, or MDBS because the structurespecification included it.andP;  The newer relational DBMSs didn't provide forreferential integrity.andP;  Application developers needed to write proceduralcode to ensure its existence.andM;The move today is for relational systems to give developers a way ofcapturing referential integrity in the database, although most relationalDBMSs don't do this yet.andP;  Two main ways exist to provide referentialintegrity.andP;  One involves storing a procedure (called a trigger) as part ofthe database and executing it automatically when the relevant data isupdated.andP;  SQL Server, Intervase, and Ingres use variations of this method.andO;Flexibility is its main virtue, because it can go beyond mere referentialintegrity to capture more general business rules.andP;  For example, you mightwant to verify that an order doesn't take a customer beyond his authorizedcredit limit.andM;The alternative is a declarative approach, where the data definition language(DDL) is extended, allowing for the specification of integrity constraints.andO;IBM adopted this method for their DBMSs including DB2, SQL/DS, and ExtendedEdition Data Manager.andP;  The advantages of the declarative approach are that itis easier to specify constraints.andP;  and that it is documented simply bylisting the DDL.andP;  The ANSI committee on SQL will be using a version of thisdeclarative approach.andM;The SOL standardandM;Just as the relational model dominates the database world, SQL dominates therelational language market.andP;  Ingres' QUEL language was thought by some to betechnically superior to SQL, but has almost disappeared.andP;  Ingres is nowSQL-based.andP;  Even Ashton-Tate has tried grafting SQL onto DBASE.andM;IBM's SQL version has become a de facto standard.andP;  To many independentsoftware vendors it's more important to be IBM-compatible than ANSI-standardcompatible.andP;  IBM's oft-repeated statement that it will comply with standardsmakes compatibility easier to achieve.andP;  In fact, IBM is ahead of the standardwith its implementation of referential integrity.andP;  In 1986, the AmericanNational Standards Institute gave us ANSI86 SQL.andP;  They modified it in 1989 tothe current specification, ANSI89.andP;  All relational vendors today support SQLand profess a commitment to it.andP;  Yet all SQLs are different.andP;  Will thestandards movement change that?andM;Ken Jacobs, director of RDBMS marketing for Oracle Corp., is a member of theANSI SQL committee.andP;  He points out that standards are extremely important toprovide connectivity in heterogeneous environments.andP;  He adds that no DBMStoday conforms with ANSI86 or ANSI89.andP;  However, sometime in the Spring, theNational Institute of Standards and Technology (formerly the National Bureauof Standards) was to have issued a test suite for SQL compliance with theANSI89 standard.andP;  The test will flag all nonstandard SQL with warningmessages.andP;  By making the claim of standards conformity verifiable, this testsuite will push vendors toward the standard.andP;  Indeed, Oracle is committed tohaving its Release 7 pass the test suite.andM;All vendors quickly point out that conformance to the standard is just abeginning.andP;  The current standard doesn't support necessary functions likereferential integrity or outer joins, yet virtually every applicationrequires both.andP;  (This means when two tables are joined based on an equalvalue in a column, the rows with mismatched values are eliminated.andP;  Joiningthe customer and order tables creates a list matching each customer with itsorder.andP;  Customers who've ordered nothing aren't listed.andP;  If you wanted to seethose customers, perhaps with blanks where the order information would be,you'd need to use an outer join-or resort to a more cumbersome equivalentwhich has limitations.)andM;The proposed second version of the standard, called SQL2, will probablyaddress many of these deficiencies.andP;  Unfortunately, additions to the standardare so many and complicated that even in the best of all worlds SQL2 probablywon't be implemented by any vendor for a year or two after it's official.andM;Doom tuneandM;Mike Stonebreaker calls SQL2 &quot;ridiculous.&quot; An original developer of Ingres,he's a pioneer of relational DBMSs, V.P.andP;  of Ingres, and Professor ofComputer Science at the University of California at Berkeley.andP;  He believesany language designed by a committee of 50 is doomed to failure.andP;  The vendorshave already gone further than the proposals, by implementing such functionsas support for complex data types.andM;Chris Date, of Codd and Date, is concerned about the expanding SQL standardand believes that the committee may have increased the redundancy of the SQLlanguage.andP;  Date, one of the early contributors to the relational model, is alucid thinker on a wide range of database topics-reflected in some of thebest books on the subject.andP;  (Anyone interested in understanding DBMSs shouldread An Introduction to Database Systems.andP;  To understand the arguments inrelational theory try Relational Database Writings 1985-1989.) He's addressedthe redundancy problem in earlier writings, pointing out the multitude ofways even simple queries can be expressed.andP;  He is bothered that alternativeways to express equivalent queries have risen considerably with the advent ofSQL2.andP;  This duplication dramatically increases the difficulty of writingcorrect, efficient, understandable SQL.andM;We can probably conclude that the SQL standard will be a minimum to whichvendors will conform.andP;  Naturally, they'll continue to seek advantage in themarketplace through extensions designed to address the needs of customers.andM;Architecture: the latest trendandM;Client-server architectures became important in the 1980s.andP;  The major trendis for front-end tools to migrate to the PC, where graphical user interfaces(GUIs) offer vast improvements in ease of use.andP;  The need to communicate witha host of DBMSs, especially IBM's DB2, has motivated software vendors tosupport compatibility.andP;  Programs like Paradox, DataEase, and DBASE onceworked solely by themselves.andP;  Today, vendors are porting their languages andapplication development tools to work with server engines like those fromSybase, Gupta, and IBM, as well as mainframe servers like DB2.andM;Today, the lack of a standard SQL and communications language make thiscompatibility difficult.andP;  Roger Sippl, head of Informix Corp., is thechairperson of the SQL Access Group.andP;  Fourteen companies, including Informix,Ingres, and Oracle, formed this group to speed development of a DBMScommunications standard to specify how to invoke remote DBMSs.andP;  It's based onthe current ANSI standard.andP;  They're working with other standards groupsincluding the ANSI SQL committee and the Remote Data Access group.andP;  The goalof their standard (which went out for public comment in April) is to allowapplications to transparently work (or &quot;interoperate&quot; in current jargon) withdifferent DBMSs.andP;  While I expect an accepted standard to form, it'll be oflimited use since it doesn't support the SQL extensions (outerjoins andreferential integrity) that I've already discussed.andM;The present stateandM;Many vendors can't wait for the standard, so they're moving ahead.andO;Consequently, Oracle has SQLConnect, Sybase its remote procedure-callinterface, Ingres its General Communication Architecture, and Apple its CL/1.andO;Perhaps the furthest along in connectivity is Information Builders, Inc. ItsFocus DBMS and fourth generation language provide gateways to a wide varietyof relational and non-relational DBMSs, in both a single common hostarchitecture and client-server architecture.andP;  It is also one of the fewproducts that connect to SQL Server that is also shipping.andP;  Future standardswill be a baseline from which vendors will build what they think suits theircustomers.andP;  The tension between innovation and expediency on the one hand,and standards on the other, won't go away.andM;Getting aroundandM;Distributed databases are closely related to the client-server model.andP;  In itssimplest form &quot;true distributed database&quot; means that while data may reside ina variety of databases, the user or program sees the data as if it were in asingle database (sometimes called the single image model).andP;  No one deliversthis kind of distributed database today, although many companies deliverparts of it.andP;  Ingres, Informix, and Oracle let you join data from multipleremote sites; and Ingres and Informix attempt to optimize the join (i.e.andO;minimize network, CPU, and I/O costs).andP;  Sybase, Interbase, and Ingres use atwo-phase commit protocol that keeps multiple databases in synchronizationwhen a transaction updates them.andM;Onward and downwardandM;Among vendors I interviewed for this article, most said they'll extendfunctionality to better solve the distributed database problem in the future.andO;However, I teach a series of seminars in the U.S.andP;  and Europe on distributeddatabase, and few attendees need a full distributed database to solve theirproblems (although all would like it).andP;  Does user demand exist? Yes, butperhaps more demand than real need.andP;  In some cases the vendors have paidattention to more technically sophisticated issues rather than features thatwill solve immediate problems.andP;  In fact, Norris van den Berg, Manager of DataSystems Architectures at IBM, said that for the IBM customer advisorycouncil, asynchronous snapshot capability was more important than distributedtransaction processing.andP;  (When you shoot an &quot;asynchronous snapshot,&quot; you takean image of a central database portion and send it to remote databaseswithout bothering to worry about keeping duplicated data consistent.) As moredistributed database functionality becomes available, users will learn betterways to make use of it.andP;  The technology is leading the user rather than theother way around.andM;The new kidandM;Many DBMS vendors have recognized the importance of handling complex datatypes such as text, image, voice, and documents (called BLOBs-Binary or BasicLarge Objects).andP;  This, along with stored procedures and triggers, is part ofthe progression towards capturing more application semantics in the databaseitself Jim Starkey, president of Interbase Corp., sees methods thatefficiently store and process these data types as a critical step in dealingwith the increasing variety of complex applications in engineering, science,and office automation.andP;  Interbase itself uses BLOBs to manage their DBMSsource code.andM;Round like a circle...andM;Handling complex data types may be among the first steps toward creating atruly object-oriented DBMS.andP;  I asked Mike Stonebreaker if he could define&quot;object oriented&quot;.andP;  He replied, &quot;I try very hard not to.&quot; While most of usagree that object orientation will become more important with time, there'ssome uncertainty as to exactly what it means.andP;  In particular, will objectoriented DBMSs become extensions of current relational technology?andM;I asked Chris Date what he thought of object oriented systems.andP;  He repliedthat they contained some good ideas, such as type inheritance (where a datatype definition may inherit properties from other data types), user defineddata types, and better matches between language and the data; but heconsiders some ideas mixed blessings for database processing.andP;  He citedencapsulation as an example.andP;  A data type and the operating code are boundtogether as a reusable entity.andP;  That's a good feature for data independence,but not necessarily for optimization.andP;  Other problems also exist, such asdeveloping generic integrity rules like referential integrity, that don'trequire tailored procedures for enforcing each occurrence.andM;Date and Stonebreaker both believe that the benefits of object orienteddatabases can be grafted onto existing relational DBMSs.andP;  For example, thecurrent release of Ingres has an 'Object Management Extension&quot; that allowsfor the definition of complex data types and additional SQL functionality tomanipulate them.andM;Not surprisingly, the vendors of object-oriented DBMSs see big differencesbetween relational and object-oriented products.andP;  Jacob Stein, a SeniorEngineer with Servio Logic, points out that object manipulation isn'tset-oriented, like relational processing.andP;  Servio Logic sells Gemstone, anobject-oriented DBMS.andP;  He asserts that the very strengths of relational DBMSsand SQL are frequently irrelevant to applications where object-orienteddatabases are appropriate, and could result in poor performance.andP;  To workwith operational data, like accounting or inventory data, the best method maybe building interfaces to relational DBMSs, such as the one Servio Logic isdeveloping for Sybase.andM;We could conclude that while there are many interesting developments coming,nothing in the next decade will replace the relational model as the leadingapproach to database management.andP;  Some products, like object oriented DBMSs,will claim certain niche markets, but the relational model will absorb theirbetter features.andM;Crystal ball strategiesandM;Up to this point we've looked at technology trends.andP;  But what about themarket? Will your favorite DBMS vendor be in business five years from now?andO;The PC marketplace is undergoing two major changes.andP;  The introduction ofserver-based DBMSs from Novell, Sybase/ Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, andGupta-with almost all the industrial strength features of their mainframe andmini-computer brethren-open whole new classes of complex applications fornetworked micros to solve.andP;  Furthermore, mainframe connectivity has become amajor issue, since &quot;corporate&quot; data continues to center on mainframes.andO;What's this mean for desktop database vendors and their networked versions?andO;All of the vendors I spoke with had reasonable strategies for success in the'90s, typically involving connectivity to server DBMS engines on micros andmainframes-in some cases not even on their own database engines.andP;  Can theyexecute these strategies, and will the market be large enough for all? Onlytime and buyers will tell.andM;How far ahead can we predict? Ten years ago few people predicted the risingpower of the microcomputer and its spread in business.andP;  A few visionariespredicted the success of the relational model and SQL; aptly-named Oraclesuccessfully built its company on that insight.andP;  Are object-oriented DBMSs anew paradigm-the successor to the relational model-and Servio Logic the nextOracle? Perhaps.andP;  A more likely scenario is that the intensity of competitionin the DBMS market will keep current contenders seeking that elusivetechnological edge.andP;  Evolution will come from the trends in place now, ratherthan from revolution.andP;  But, you never know...andM;In Santa Fe, New Mexico a brilliant but reclusive computer scientist puts thefinishing touches on her self-extending organic neural net computer thatorganizes data, based on the information you require from it.andP;  By constantlymonitoring usage patterns, the database is self re-organizing.andP;  The storagemechanism is holographic, with the fully parallel access and redundancy thatimplies.andP;  The interface is connected directly to your mind, so that you onlyneed to think of what you want, and the answer appears in the appropriateformat (even paper).andM;Herb Edelstein is a founder and principal of Euclid Associates, a consultingfirm specializing in database management, electronic image management, anddesktop publishing.andP;  Mr. Edelstein consults to computer vendors and users,teaches professional seminars, and is a frequent speaker on a variety ofcomputer topics.andP;  Mr. Edelstein was V.P.andP;  of Marketing and Sales at Sybase, arelational database management system vendor.andP;  Mr. Edelstein's educationincludes a BS in Physics from the University of Maryland, an MAT in Physicsfrom Johns Hopkins University, and an MSIA from Carnegie-Mellon University.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
