 It comprises a 16-MHZ '386SX PC (in a sharp black case) containing 1MB of RAM, a 1.2-MB floppy drive, a 40-MB hard disk, a VGA video card, twoserial ports, one parallel port, four of Caere's OmniPage boards (each with a68020 processor and 2 MB of RAM) and two empty slots (for scanner and networkinterface cards).andP;  Caere's Parallel Reader software is preinstalled; MS-DOS4.0 and a runtime version of Microsoft Windows 2.03 are also bundled.andP;  Allthe user needs are a VGA monochrome or color monitor, a Windows-compatiblepointing device, an AT-compatible keyboard, a supported scanner(Hewlett-Packard ScanJet Plus, Microtek MS-II or Fujitsu M309x) and somedocuments to convert to computer files.andM;Built into the Parallel Reader are the capabilities of two recent Caereprograms: OmniSpell, an OCR-specific spelling checker, and OmniDraft, whichimproves recognition of dot-matrix text.andM;After the scanner (a ScanJet Plus with an automatic document feeder) read thefirst page in, the first OmniPage board started to process it.andP;  Pages weresuccessively scanned into each of the other three boards.andP;  By the time thelast page had been scanned, the first board had finished processing its dataand was ready for more.andM;The system indicates graphically the status of each board.andP;  The user caneasily tell when the Reader is ready for another scanned page.andM;Quicker than a wink.andP;  Speed gains of parallel processing on a multipagedocument were impressive.andP;  We tried two different four-page sets of pressreleases--not an especially strenuous task, but one that could wellillustrate parallel operation.andP;  The Reader scanned, recognized and brought upon the screen each set of four pages in between two and three minutes.andO;Accuracy was up to OmniPage's usual standard.andM;Although we didn't note the processing time for a single page, we believe thefour-page operation was at least twice as fast as processing four pages witha single OmniPage board.andM;The Parallel Reader is far faster than any of the software-only OCR packageswe tested late last year (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  5).andP;  We do not yet know how itsspeed compares with that of high-end systems such as the Kurzweil (XeroxImaging Systems) K5100 or the Calera TopScan series.andP;  Part 2 of our OCRsurvey, in which we will review these and other hardware-based systems (aswell as some additional software packages), should appear this summer.andM;An incomplete platform.andP;  Caere plans to ship the Parallel Reader this monthfor $10,995.andP;  Outfitting it with the proper monitor, keyboard, mouse andscanner will probably add $1,500-$2,000, depending on the scanner and whetheryou choose a monochrome or color monitor.andP;  The total opportunity cost will beless for many users, who can run typical DOS or OS/2 applications on themachine when it's not reading pages; mail-order houses sell similarlyconfigured 386SX machines for about $1,500-$2,000.andM;We find it strange that Caere does not sell a complete system--one thatincludes at least a keyboard, monitor and mouse, and perhaps a scanner.andP;  Itmay be (understandably) loathe to be forced to offer several possibleconfigurations, but few users are likely to have all those components lyingabout unused.andM;The Parallel Reader strikes us as an excellent idea, one that should arousegreat interest in the marketplace.andP;  Speed is not the only consideration, ofcourse, nor even the most important one; prospective customers must test anysystem's accuracy on their documents, and they must trade off Caere's pagerecognition features against the advanced formatting options offered by othersystems.andP;  In our forthcoming OCR article, we will explore the ParallelReader's merits relative to those of its higher-priced brethren.andM;Ocron announces omnifont OCRandM;Ocron, producer of the trainable OCR program ReadPro, announced a forthcomingautomatic (omnifont) OCR package called OmniPlus.andP;  Part of its recognitioncapability has been adapted from work done in China on recognizingideographic characters.andM;OmniPlus is scheduled for May shipment at a list price of $795.andP;  LikeReadPro, it will run under Microsoft Windows on '286- and '386-based ATs.andO;Because the program's core technology will only occupy about 450K of memory,Ocron says, the program will run well on a 2-MB machine.andM;How it works.andP;  According to Ocron, OmniPlus combines features of the two mostprevalent OCR methods--matrix matching, in which stored bitmaps are comparedwith scanned ones, and feature extraction, which operates on characteristicsrather than precise appearance.andP;  Ocron's method, which it calls&quot;Cross-Mapping,&quot; stores characters as compressed templates; Ocron claims thatthis method is more tolerant of minor character variations than are thoseused in competing products.andM;Technology used in ReadPro is being added to OmniPlus to buttress itsautomatic operation with trainability.andP;  When OmniPlus fails to recognize acharacter properly, the user can add it to a master file that is checked forevery document.andM;Features: pro and con.andP;  Among OmniPlus's more distinctive features are theoption to have the program flag page breaks and what Ocron calls &quot;transactionprocessing,&quot; which allows the user to enter a specified character sequence atthe top of a page so that that point will be flagged in the text.andP;  The lattercapability will be valuable when the user is scanning a series of documents,some or all of which contain multiple pages.andP;  In addition, an OmniPlus usercan define up to 99 zones on a page, renumber them in any order, and savethem as a template.andM;However, two major capabilities that ReadPro lacks will also be missing fromOmniPlus: it won't pass on character attributes, nor will it translategraphics into graphic files.andP;  Ocron plans to implement the former feature inOmniPlus 1.1, due in July; the latter should be added next fall.andM;Ocron is adapting OmniPlus to work with all Roman languages.andP;  It plans torelease a German version of the program in May; others will follow.andM;We briefly ran a beta version of OmniPlus.andP;  Considering the brevity of ourtesting and the incompleteness of the software, we avoided drawing firmconclusions, but the program showed us enough to make us anxious to see thefinal product.andM;XIS adds to OCR lineupandM;In a departure from its existing Kurzweil and Datacopy OCR product lines,Xerox Imaging Systems has acquired a program called iRecognize from thecompany iBase.andP;  It will be sold as an optional ($1,000) enhancement to theKurzweil Discover Freedom and Model 30 products; it cannot run without aKurzweil recognition board.andM;XIS is positioning iRecognize for use in high-volume text scanningapplications.andP;  The features it offers that the Kurzweil products don'tinclude manual zone definition and simultaneous recognition of text andgraphics.andM;A standalone program called iVerify will be included with iRecognize.andP;  Itcontains a post-recognition editor within which the user can look for un- andmisrecognized characters while seeing the original image.andP;  It can also beconfigured to recognize certain position-specific items, such as whether acheck mark has been placed in a survey box; there are obvious applicationsfor such a capability.andM;The final module, iConvert, can translate the file for use in many wordprocessors.andM;We saw a prerelease version of the Kurzweil CALS System 1.5, which isdesigned to support Amendment A of MIL-M-28001 and the CALS Raster StandardCCITT, Group 4.andP;  It will also support multiple Document Type Definitions asdefined under Amendment A.andP;  The Kurzweil CALS System 1.5, which uses thecompany's 400-dpi K5100 scanner, is scheduled to be released this spring.andM;Gray F/X.andP;  XIS also showed a beta version of Gray F/X 1.1.andP;  We first saw thisgray-scale image editing program, which is based on Media Cybernetics'Publisher's Partner software, at the September Conference (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andO;3, p. 31).andP;  New features include real-time gray-map display and brightness,contrast and gamma control; an expanded set of special effects (both morekinds of effects--e.g., sculpt, spatial posterize, despeckle with sensitivitycontrol--and more options within each kind); enhanced masking; improved userinterface features; and additional scanner, printer and monitor support.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
