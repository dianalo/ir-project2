The El Segundo, Calif., defense contractor was fined $5.5million in the original conviction.</LP><TEXT>   The case drew widespread attention because Rockwell arguedit was unfairly prosecuted for the actions of two employeesthat were exposed by its lawyers following an internalinvestigation. The company said it turned its inquiry over tothe Pentagon under the government's &quot;voluntary disclosureprogram&quot; and didn't expect to be prosecuted.   That stance led to speculation that if Rockwell werefined, it could prevent other defense companies from takingself-policing measures under the government program.   Yesterday, Rockwell said it couldn't comment because itslawyers hadn't yet learned of the decision.   The U.S. attorney's office argued that the company'sfraudulent billing was first discovered by governmentauditors in 1985 and that Rockwell was under criminalinvestigation beginning in March 1986 -- long before thecompany said it was turning in its employees under thevoluntary disclosure program in October 1986. The prosecutionargued that other company executives were involved in acover-up.   Yesterday, George B. Newhouse, an assistant U.S. attorney,said the government maintained that Rockwell had neverproperly applied for admission into the voluntary disclosureprogram. &quot;On the eve of indictment, Rockwell asked to beformally admitted. The court observed that was too little,too late,&quot; Mr. Newhouse said.</TEXT></DOC>
