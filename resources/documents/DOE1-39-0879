New Brunswick believes that the goal of selfsufficiency in oil supply should be secondary to that of overall securityof supply in energy in all parts of Canada. Security of supply shouldnot be restricted to oil alone but should consider all forms of energyincluding conventional and alternate energy as well as energy efficiency.The two main resources available to New Brunswick at this time in termsof security of energy supply are year-round ocean transport access toworld oil and coal sources and a diversified electrical power generatingsystem having strong interconnections with neighbouring Canadian andUnited States utilities. In terms of security of supply New Brunswickbelieves that market forces should be allowed to work in deciding thetiming of major energy projects in Canada, all energy forms should beconsidered in formulating policy on energy security, and the Federalgovernment should ensure that alternative energy supply systems are inplace to provide security to all areas of the country.</TEXT></DOC>
