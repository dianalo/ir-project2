The investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc. said late Thursday itwas joining Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and a group of top managersat RJR Nabisco who are considering a challenge to Kohlberg Kravisfor control of the Atlanta-based cigarette and food giant.   ``The combination of Salomon Brothers and Shearson Lehman Huttonforms a team with extraordinary capital strength and capabilities,''F. Ross Johnson, the president and chief executive of RJR Nabisco,said in a prepared statement.   Johnson leads the group of managers who last week announced theywere considering offering to buy the company for $17 billion incooperation with Shearson. He said ``numerous'' other firms hadexpressed interest in supporting a bid.   RJR Nabisco's stock rose 75 cents a share to $82.75 in earlytrading today on the New York Stock Exchange. It fell $2.75 a shareon Thursday, before Salomon's entry was announced.   The price decline indicated doubts about the cash value of theKohlberg Kravis $90-a-share tender offer as well as broader concernsabout the health of the takeover business.   Kohlberg Kravis, which launched its tender offer Thursday, saidin a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission it was``extremely confident'' it could raise the money to complete the bid.   Kohlberg Kravis has lined up some big-league Wall Street backersof its own. It said in its SEC filing that Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.,Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co., Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and MerrillLynch Capital Markets were assisting it in structuring and financingthe buyout offer.   Analysts said they believed Kohlberg Kravis could raise themoney, but said that because the offer was not all cash, it actuallywas worth less than $90 a share.   RJR Nabisco's stock price had been inflated by expectations thata higher bid might be forthcoming, and the price fell Thursday asthat speculation waned. The company's managers originally said theywere considering an offer of about $75 a share in cash.   Dampening the speculative fever for takeover targets werecomments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who hascontended banks should be cautious about lending too much money forleveraged buyouts.   In a sign that it still hoped to avoid full-scale hostilities,Kohlberg Kravis said its offer for RJR Nabisco was conditioned onsigning a merger agreement with the board of directors.   Since its founding in 1976, Kohlberg Kravis has never acquired acompany without the support of the target's board.   Getting the support of directors and at least some managers wouldensure a smoother transition if Kohlberg Kravis succeeded in takingover the company.   Kohlberg Kravis made its tender offer to shareholders only afterfailing to reach agreement with RJR Nabisco's managers and Shearsonon some kind of a joint bid for the company.   Kohlberg Kravis, a privately-owned partnership, has become one ofthe United States' largest industrial holding companies by buyingout companies with the participation of their managers.   In its SEC filing, Kohlberg Kravis said it would require about$20.15 billion to buy all of RJR Nabisco's shares and to pay relatedfees and expenses. It said additional funds might be required tocover RJR Nabisco's long-term debt, which it said is $5.11 billion.   Kohlberg Kravis said that if its bid succeeded, it anticipatedselling some of the company's assets, but said it had no definiteplans.   Investment firms participating in the deal will reap huge fees.According to the SEC filing, about $2.5 billion of the money raisedfor the deal would go for fees and expenses. It was not stated howmuch would be for fees and how much for other types of expenses.</TEXT></DOC>
