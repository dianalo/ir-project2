The Soviet Union is the world'slargest oil producer and Elf, once a sleepy provincialindustrial company, must have a piece of the action there,says Elf's chief.   In fact, he says he wants a piece of almost anything thatis profitable. And he won't narrow the focus of businesseswithin the giant Elf structure. Although he sees Elf asprimarily an oil producing company, he isn't concerned thatit also dabbles in pharmaceuticals, perfumes and evensunflower seeds. As long as the individual business isprofitable, it's all right.   &quot;I want to make money,&quot; he said. &quot;My point of view is veryclear. However, I have sold the dental equipment business.&quot;   The Elf executive has surprised industry colleagues withhis zeal. There had been some concern when he took over twoyears ago that he might be a caretaker chairman, carrying outthe wishes of the French government, which owns 53.9% of thecompany. Mr. Le Floch-Prigent was hand-picked by FrenchPresident Francois Mitterrand to run Elf.   Instead, &quot;I'm impressed with what he's doing with thecompany,&quot; said John Wellemeyer, oil analyst for MorganStanley in London.   Analysts expect the company's net this year to match oronly slightly lag last year's results of $8.59 a share, or$2.08 billion. And that's despite anticipation of lower oilprices throughout the rest of this year. During this periodlast year, oil prices surged because of turmoil in the MiddleEast.   Regardless of Elf's strong performance, its shares, whichwere listed on the New York Stock Exchange several monthsago, aren't as widely traded as other international major oilcompanies'. Its share price-to-earnings ratio, a strongindicator of a company's appeal to investors, climbed toabout nine from as low as six earlier this year. But Mr.Wellemeyer believes that Elf's ratio should at least matchExxon Corp.'s ratio of 13.   Lack of a high profile is part of the problem. And Mr. LeFloch-Prigent is trying to correct that. The company justspent $1 million to sponsor an exhibit of paintings by Frenchartist Georges Seurat at New York's Metropolitan Museum ofArt this fall to garner publicity. And unlike hispredecessor, Michel Pecqueur, he travels to the U.S. at leastonce a month to meet with analysts, fund managers and evenindividual investors with deep pockets. By year end he alsoexpects to change the name of Elf subsidiaries world-wide inan effort to reflect the logo of the parent. For instance,Sanofi, the company's health-care unit, will be renamed ElfSanofi.   The need for greater name recognition won't mean U.Sretail outlets, however. It costs too much to break into theU.S. refining and marketing business, the Elf chief believes.In fact, he says, it costs too much to even explore for oilin the U.S.   Therefore, he has reversed the course set only a few yearsago by the previous chairman. Mr. Pecquer had built a team ofmergers and acquisition professionals in Houston to scour theU.S. for business opportunities. That office has been trimmedand will likely do little more than manage properties Elfalready leases in the Gulf of Mexico.   But Mr. Le Floch-Prigent has been aggressive, as have U.S.companies, in amassing oil reserves elsewhere. Close tothree-quarters of the company's $4 billion budget this year,excluding acquisitions, is devoted to exploration, productionand development. Oil reserves are the lifeblood of an oilcompany. And Elf is one of the few companies that produces asmuch oil as it uses. Most majors are lucky to pump 50% oftheir needs, analysts say. The French oil giant has met itsreserve target of three billion barrels of oil or itsequivalent, says the Elf chief, who has already set a newgoal of four billion barrels.   During the past 18 months, the company claims to have hadsignificant discoveries in Nigeria, Angola and the Congo. Andits recent purchase of North Sea oil and gas holdings fromOccidental Petroleum Corp. has made Elf the fourth-largestNorth Sea producer, after Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Exxon andBritish Petroleum.   But Elf's strategy of going to far-flung places toincrease oil reserves is risky, says Michael Mayer, ananalyst at Wertheim Schroder. &quot;There's political risk. Sure,things seem to have changed in some countries that have longbeen closed to Western companies. But they can change backagain,&quot; he says. As for Elf's Soviet strategy, it's just oneof many companies trying for a foothold there, he points out;all that competition may drive entry costs up and profitdown.   Even as it pumps oil from wells in a Paris suburb, thecompany is also looking to play in the big leagues -- theVenezuelan oil fields in South America as well as prospectsin the Middle East. The Middle East especially &quot;is an areathat is a major place for reserves, so we need to be in thatpart of the world,&quot; the chairman said.   Elf has already gained footholds in Syria, Oman, Qatar andYemen. And because it was a producer in Iran and Iraq beforethose countries nationalized their oil industries years ago,Elf is looking to reenter those producing forums again aswell. Saudi Arabia? &quot;Everyday I look at a map of Saudi oilreserves and I try to think of what type of an agreement Icould get with them,&quot; Mr. Le Floch-Prigent jokes.   A move to internationalize Elf was already afoot beforeMr. Le Floch-Prigent arrived on the scene. However, the pacehas quickened significantly. Even the Elf chief, himself, issurprised at how rapidly plans have advanced, especially inthe exploration and production sectors. &quot;I expected it wouldtake four years rather than two to get where we are today inthat business,&quot; he said.   And the move to develop business opportunities outsideFrance extends into every facet of the company's operations.Elf launched a public bid to acquire 13.5% of Cia. Espanolade Petroleos S.A. on top of the 20.5% it already owns. Such amove assures Elf of becoming one of the three largestgasoline retailers in Spain.   The French chairman, who frequently does his ownnegotiating, is also discussing refining and marketingventures in Brunei in Southeast Asia. And later this month,he will travel to China to discuss opportunities in thechemical business. &quot;Perhaps I will come back with somegeneral trading agreements,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
