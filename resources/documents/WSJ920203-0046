Last week, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals uphelda ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Southern Districtthat dismissed a shareholder lawsuit against Citicorpalleging securities fraud. The plaintiffs claimed that thebank failed to establish adequate reserves for loan losseswhile publicly stating that it was financially stable. Awillful misrepresentation would be a violation of theSecurities and Exchange Act of 1934.</LP><TEXT>   Financial institutions around the country, especially inthe Northeast, have increasingly been sued by shareholderswho allege that management fraudulently misrepresented theinstitutions' financial health because of the loss provisionscharged against earnings. Lawyers say 150 to 200 lawsuitshave been filed in the last two years by shareholdersalleging fraud, including cases against Citicorp, ChaseManhattan Corp., Shawmut National Corp. and others.   Most banks view these suits as a thorn in their side anddo not expect to pay money damages, but they are neverthelessconcerned about time and legal costs.   U.S. District Judge Robert Owen ruled that by claiming thebank failed to establish proper reserves, the plaintiff, J.Dolly Ciresi on behalf of herself and others, was arguingthat the bank was mismanaged. But the court said that even ifthe company may have been mismanaged, that did not constitutefraud. The court did not address the issue of Citicorp'sreserve posture or whether the company was mismanaged.   &quot;The court clearly differentiated between making mistakesand lying,&quot; said Joseph T. McLaughlin, a partner at Shearmanandamp; Sterling who successfully argued the case.   Lawyers who defend banking companies against these suitssay the case should help stave off similar litigation andstrengthen the defense of their existing cases. The SecondCircuit Court of Appeals, in New York, is considered the mostimportant federal court for decisions on securities lawsbecause many financial institutions are based here.   &quot;The court affirmed a well-reasoned decision on which manybanks are relying,&quot; said Douglas Kraus, a partner at Skadden,Arps, Slate Meagher andamp; Flom, who is defending a number offinancial institutions in similar cases. &quot;It's going to behelpful for other banks subject to these kinds of suits.&quot;   Added H. Rodgin Cohen, partner at Sullivan andamp; Cromwell,&quot;The Second Circuit decision, combined with a number of otherrulings, should be seen as a favorable development.&quot;   Still, the court issued a summary order rather than a fullwritten decision, which means the decision cannot be reliedupon in unrelated cases. But lawyers said the lower-courtruling can still be used as precedent, and the Appeals Courtruling can be used &quot;as an affirmation without an opinion,&quot;Mr. Kraus said.   Richard Greenfield, a partner at Greenfield andamp; Chimicles,which represents plaintiffs in scores of these types ofcases, disagreed that it has any application to other suits.He noted that there are still other suits against Citicorpthat will continue. &quot;Each complaint will stand on its own,&quot;he said.   A spokesman for Citicorp said &quot;We are pleased that theAppeals Court decision affirms our previous stated beliefthat the suit was without merit.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
