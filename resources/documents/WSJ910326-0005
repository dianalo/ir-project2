Separately, IBM is expected to announce today its re-entryinto the fastgrowing laptop computer market. As previouslyreported, the machine is expected finally to give IBM astrong entry in a market it has repeatedly missed in thepast.</LP><TEXT>   Although IBM declined to say what it would announce at thetwo separate news conferences scheduled for today, industryexecutives said IBM and ATandamp;T will say they are going tocooperate in the important area of network management.   Corporate customers are building increasingly far-flungnetworks of computers and telephones but are also trying toconsolidate the management of those networks by havingcomputers do much of the work. Although the market for suchsystems isn't huge, those companies competing for it figurethat they win big in later purchases if they capture the coreof the networks.   ATandamp;T's Accumaster and IBM's Netview have been two of thethree biggest network-management competitors in the U.S. --with Digital Equipment Corp.'s offering being the third. Butthere have been limitations for each system. An ATandamp;T systemmight not recognize an &quot;alert&quot; that an IBM computer wouldsend across the network when a data line went down. Or IBM'ssystem might not be able to look deeply enough into the ATandamp;Tnetwork to automatically look up a customer's bill andpresent it to the operator when the operator answers thatcustomer's call.   So ATandamp;T and IBM will make sure their systems speak acommon language and cooperate with each other.   &quot;You have the best of both worlds,&quot; said Michael Kennedy,head of corporate networking at Arthur D. Little, Cambridge,Mass. &quot;I think this is an important step.&quot;   The IBM-ATandamp;T accord should have the side benefit for usersof helping set a standard for others in the market, too.   &quot;With these guys doing it, everyone will have to followsuit,&quot; said Jerry McDowell, a consultant with Meta Group,Westport, Conn.   Meanwhile, IBM, Armonk, N.Y., announced a program thatwill let more employees work part-time or at home. While somebig companies already offer such programs, employee-benefitsconsultants say the computer company is enough of atrend-setter that other companies may follow.   &quot;For IBM to do it will make other people think more aboutdoing it, too,&quot; said Barney Olmsted, co-director of New Waysto Work, a San Francisco-based group that tracks flexibleworking arrangements. &quot;Part-time employment is one of thetoughest things for employers to come to grips with.&quot;   IBM said it will let employees cut their hours to 20 to 30a week if they need to care for a dependent, have aonce-in-a-lifetime opportunity or have some otherdemonstrable need. The employees will receive full benefitsfor three years. After that, they will either get 75% ofnormal medical and dental coverage or pay $40 a month andretain full coverage.   IBM also said it is rolling out nationwide a program forpeople who want to work part-time but can't do it at theirnormal office. A pilot project had been under way at 13locations in the U.S.   IBM said it is becoming more flexible about its workingconditions both to accommodate people and to help it retainvalued employees. There may also be cost savings, which wouldbe especially welcome at a time when IBM has indicated thatearnings may drop 50% in the first quarter and that the wholeyear will be difficult. But a spokesman said any savings aretough to estimate at this point, and &quot;the program was notdesigned with that as the guiding force.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
