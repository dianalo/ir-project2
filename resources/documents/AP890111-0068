Over the past two weeks, the usually shy creature has shamelesslyreduced the population in the 25-foot pond, where she and herhusband have raised goldfish for 20 years, from 100 fish to 60, shesaid.   ``What does Big Bird think that pond is, Midget Sound?'' shesaid. The bird ``comes for breakfast, lunch, dinner and in-betweensnacks.''   ``If the fish he plucks from the pond are too big, he flips themon gravel near the pond,'' she said. ``The others? One gulp and theyare gone.''   She spread rakes, brooms, 2-by-4 boards and shelves across thepond, but ``they only provided better perches for the heron togobble fish,'' she said.   ``As urban problems go, this one is pretty unusual,'' said DebbieBooker, a state Wildlife Department administrative assistant. ``Wegets calls about starlings between walls, squirrels in attics,raccoons eating cat food in outside dishes, coyotes invadingneighborhoods, but blue heron problems are rare.''   At the agency's suggestion, Biesen spread chicken wire over thepond, but Big Bird simply walked on the wire and continued itsforays through the mesh. Finally, last week, she lowered the waterin the pond to 2 feet from 3{ feet.   ``The fish may have to swim sideways, but I haven't seen that BigBird catch any of them yet,'' she said. ``He comes back regularlyand walks the wire, but he apparently can't reach the fish.''   Biesen said she isn't sure what she'll try next if Big Bird getsto the fish again.   Killing a blue heron carries up to a $500 fine and 90 days injail, said John Gillespie, the state agency's assistant enforcementchief.   Wildlife officials have suggested loud music, gunfire or a netcanopy of the sort used to halt poaching at fish hatcheries asalternatives.</TEXT></DOC>
