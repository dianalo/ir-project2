Sincewomen-only facilities seek to advance those same protections, she said, theUnruh Act could not be used &quot;as a sword against groups seeking to use it as ashield.&quot;;    Marian Johnston, a lawyer in the civil rights division of theCalifornia Attorney General's office in Sacramento, said there have been noreported court decisions in the state in cases of men suing for access toall-woman fitness clubs. She believes such suits are usually settled beforethey go to trial.;    However, she said that health clubs, such as theFortinos', &quot;clearly would be subject&quot; to the Unruh Civil Rights Act.;    InGilroy, Dora Fortino said that while she thinks men &quot;could care less&quot; aboutjoining all-women fitness clubs, she did raise the discrimination issue withher lawyer, who could not be reached for comment.;    His advice, she said,was that there is no legal problem with a women-only policy.;    But if thereis a challenge, Fortino said, she is willing to make some adjustments.;    &quot;If(a man) wanted to be a real jerk about it and wanted to cause problems, surethey could come in . . . but they are going to come in after hours. That isall I will allow.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JACK FOLEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910805  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  720  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday August 5, 199100218050,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
