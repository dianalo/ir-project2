Yokich, the UAW vice president in chargeof the union's GM department.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Yokich also warned against &quot;any attempt by thecorporation to divide UAW members by pitting local againstlocal, or plant against plant.&quot;   Mr. Yokich's statement followed GM's announcementWednesday of a broad retrenchment that will eliminate 21North American factories and 74,000 jobs -- both salaried andhourly -- by 1995. In announcing the sweeping cuts, GMChairman Robert C. Stempel said the company wants to reopenthe three-year labor pact with the UAW to negotiateconcessions from the union.   Any such move would be controversial within the UAW,especially now. The union's trienniel convention to elect anew president is scheduled for June. Owen Bieber, who willsoon turn 62, has declared he will seek a fourth term aspresident.   It's considered unlikely that Mr. Yokich would challengehim for that job, but at age 56, Mr. Yokich would like topreserve his chances to lead the union after Mr. Bieber hitsthe mandatory retirement age of 65. Concessions would hurtthe chances of Mr. Yokich, who crushed a revolt by unionmilitants at GM two and one-half years ago.   But UAW leaders are sometimes more willing to negotiatethan their public rhetoric suggests, and Mr. Yokich'sstatement suggested that he might be flexible under certaincircumstances. &quot;The upper management side of the pain andsuffering ledger at GM remains virtually blank,&quot; Mr. Yokichsaid, &quot;while apparently hourly workers are expected to makesacrifice after sacrifice.&quot;   That statement could be a broad hint that the union mightaccept certain contract changes if GM were to cut basesalaries of top executives. GM's executives would stronglyresist that, however, because the stock bonuses that provideup to two-thirds of their total pay have been eliminated fortwo straight years.   One change the company wants is elimination of theprovision that requires GM to recall one worker for every twowho leave or retire. GM also wants all workers to takevacations during a two-week summer shutdown, instead ofcollecting unemployment benefits during that time and takingpaid vacations at other times. That change alone could savetens of millions of dollars a year.   GM also wants the UAW locals at individual plants tomodify work rules and overtime regulations. By not naming thefactories it will close, the company has set up a &quot;biddingwar&quot; among virtually all its plants. The union calls thepractice &quot;whipsawing.&quot; And Mr. Yokich said he will resist it.   While GM and the UAW have widened their cooperativeefforts in recent years, their relationship remains marred bysuspicion and mistrust. Last year, GM angered therank-and-file by sharply boosting salaried pensions,including that of retiring Chairman Roger B. Smith, whosepension was nearly doubled to $1.6 million a year.   What's more, many UAW members remember a 1982 fiasco inwhich GM lowered the hurdles for executives to earn bonusesimmediately after extracting contract concessions fromworkers.</TEXT></DOC>
