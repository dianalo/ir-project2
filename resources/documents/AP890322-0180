The service, in a brief statement, said the four finalistsincluded Fort Stewart, Ga.; Fort Chaffee, Ark.; Fort McCoy, Wis.,and Fort Lewis, Wash.   The Army disclosed the four in announcing it would soon launch anenvironmental impact study for expansion of what it calls the JointReadiness Training Center.   The Army currently operates the JRTC at Fort Chaffee, butconsiders that facility too small for modern-day infantry training.Fort Chaffee is a finalist because the Army wants to explore thepossibility of expanding the existing range there, said Lt. Col.Dick Bridges, an Army spokesman.   No matter which of the four is ultimately selected, ``land usewould include at a minimum about 46,000 acres administered by theDepartment of Defense,'' the Army said.   ``The proposal will involve (the stationing of) approximately2,000 permanently assigned personnel and training support to about35,000 rotating unit personnel,'' the service continued.   ``The JRTC will provide an area suitable for joint trainingexercises during which light infantry, air assault, airborne,Ranger, Special Operations Forces, Air Force military airlift andAir Force tactical air train to fight against an opposing force.''   The expansion is designed to provide a larger facility tocompliment its National Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif. TheNational Training Center, located in the Mojave Desert, is used bythe Army to train its heavy tank and armor forces.   The JRTC, in contrast, is used to train ``light'' infantryforces. The current JRTC at Fort Chaffee can handle only about onebattalion at a time, or about 800 to 1,000 soldiers.   A Pentagon spokesman said that ``an initial site selectionscreening process that included criteria for terrain; ability ofU.S. Air Force operations to provide air support, and environmentalconsiderations was applied to a list of 1,450 candidate sites. As aresult, the following (four) alternatives will be considered.''   The Army said it would announce the schedules for public hearingsat a later date. A draft environmental impact study is expected tobe published during the spring of 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
