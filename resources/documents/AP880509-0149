WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis, preparing for his expected role as theparty's presidential nominee, talked foreign policy with Sen. BillBradley of New Jersey on Monday. Rival Jesse Jackson exhorted coalminers to help him turn the race around on the eve of primaries inWest Virginia and Nebraska.   An aide to Republican George Bush, meanwhile, acknowledged thatthe vice president was aware of allegations of drug trafficking bythe government of Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega wellbefore Noriega's indictment this year _ an issue on which bothDukakis and Jackson have been attacking Bush.   Bush campaign spokesman Peter Teeley said Bush viewed theinformation as speculative at the time.   Jackson alone among the three remaining presidential candidateswas actively campaigning Monday.   He spent Sunday night at the home of an unemployed coal minerand his wife, Junior and Becky Cook, in all-white Arnett, W.Va.More than 500 people showed up to greet him in the economicallydepressed town of only 300 residents.   ``They have their race, but they don't have jobs,'' Jackson said.   ``They have their race, but they don't have health insurance.They have their race, but they don't have hot and cold runningwater,'' he said. ``Their race does not address those needs.''   Jackson visited a coal mine in southern West Virginia, thenvisited a toxic waste dump as he toured the state, saying his callfor economic help was cutting across racial lines.   There are 37 Democratic delegates at stake in the West Virginiaprimary, and 25 in Nebraska.   Dukakis made only brief campaign forays into both West Virginiaand Nebraska last week. He has a commanding lead in delegates tothe Democratic National Convention.   Still, Jackson told 1,500 people in Martinsburg, W.Va.: ``We'rewithin striking distance. West Virginia, you can make adifference.''   ``The race is tight,'' Jackson said. ``I'm coming to the lastlap. I'm running longer and running stronger because my mind ismade up. We've come too far. We've got to go on now. Press on.Press on. Press on.''   Dukakis spent the day at the Statehouse in Boston, where theMassachusetts governor met with Bradley for a briefing onU.S.-Soviet relations. Dukakis did not come out to comment toreporters after the hour-long meeting.   Bradley said the subject of the vice presidential spot on aDukakis ticket was not discussed. He added, ``That's not in thecards. Massachusetts and New Jersey don't go well together.''   Dukakis planned meetings with other members of Congress during astopover in Washington on Thursday before flying west to campaignin Oregon and California.   Dukakis aides said the governor will begin receiving SecretService protection Wednesday. Dukakis has previously declined theprotection.   Questions about Bush's knowledge of Noriega's alleged drugdealing have emerged as an issue in the presidential race, withDukakis and Jackson both asserting the Reagan administrationcontinued to deal with the Panamanian dictator despite evidence ofdrug invovlement.   They have pointed to Bush's experience as former head of theCIA, and head of the admnistration's task force on federal druginterdiction, as evidence he knew or should have known aboutNoriega.   Teeley, answering questions about the issue, said Bush'sassertion that he had no prior knowledge of Noriega's specific drugdealings does not suggest he was completely in the dark on thepossibility. He said Panama was one of a number of countries aboutwhich there were such reports.   ``I think anybody who knows anything about what's gone on in theworld of international narcotics trafficking is fully aware thatthere are all sorts of rumors and reports about foreign officialsbeing involved in drug trafficking, money laundering and payoffs,''Teeley said. ``Some turn out to be accurate, some are not.''   In other developments:   _ Dukakis came under fresh attack from former Democratic Gov.Edward J. King of Massachusetts, who beat him in 1978 but losttheir rematch in 1982. King, now a Republican, has appeared ontelevision and radio shows in recent weeks to criticize Dukakis,with his expenses paid for by the Bush campaign.   In a Cambridge, Mass., speech, King said Dukakis deserves nocredit for the state's economic turnaround.   _ Dukakis was endorsed by Gov. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania,where Dukakis won the state's primary overwhelmingly two weeks ago.He also picked up public backing from Rep. Harley O. Staggers Jr.,D-W.Va., and Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., both of whom will attendthe Democratic convention as ``super delegates.''   _ House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., one man mentioned asa Democratic running mate, said in Idaho Falls, Idaho, that he wasflattered to have his name mentioned but ``what I'd like to do isstay in the House of Representatives.''   _ The National Organization for Women listed 47 Democratic womenit said should be considered for roles at the Democratic NationalConvention and for the vice presidency.   NOW also urged the Democrats not to exclude from the platformstatements of support for the Equal Rights Amendment, abortionrights, gay rights and other issues. Democratic leaders, includingparty chairman Paul Kirk, want a brief platform that avoids suchcontroversial topics.</TEXT></DOC>
