Independence One Mortgage Corp., a unit of Michigan National Corp., began advertising its &quot;Rebate Plus&quot; program in newspapers and on radio stations in Detroit and Chicago this week.    An official of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation in Washington said the rebate is an original idea. &quot;It's is the first I've ever heard,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;Frankly, I hope it works.&quot;    Independence One's cash rebate applies to 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans between $50,000 and $153,100. Customers will get the cash after they pay the closing costs on their mortgage.    As part of the program, Independence One said it will waive the origination fee, which basically covers the administrative costs of the lending institution, and any discount points.    The origination fee and discount points generally add up to about 2% of the mortgage, those in the industry said. According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the national average for conventional mortgages is currently 10.79% with 2.1 discount points added. </TEXT></DOC>
