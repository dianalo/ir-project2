Uno, who has been in office less than two months, did notspecify when he would step down in the brief announcement onnational television.   He said he was resigning because the ``ultimate responsibilityis mine'' for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's defeat inSunday's elections. In losing seats to the Socialists, thegoverning party lost the upper house of Parliament for the firsttime in 34 years.   ``It was a very difficult election,'' Uno said.   Uno referred to public criticism of the party over the Recruitinfluence-peddling scandal, a new 3 percent consumption tax andliberalization of agricultural imports as factors contributing tothe defeat.   He also was severely criticized during his short tenure forallegedly keeping paid mistresses.   ``The people delivered their verdict, although we were not ableto fully debate policy issues with the opposition,'' Uno said. ``Wewill listen modestly (to the verdict), and reflect on what weshould do.''   He said he would remain in office until his successor isselected, which he said he hoped could be done ``promptly.''   The prime minister's departure will mean the resignation of theentire Cabinet and a restructuring of the Liberal DemocraticParty's leadership.   The conservative party conceded defeat on Sunday.   ``We were beaten, and all I can say is that the (opposition) didsplendidly,'' the party's secretary-general, Ryutaro Hashimoto said.   ``This is the result of the people's choice,'' said oppositionleader Takako Doi, whose Socialists gained more seats than theLiberal Democrats, according to projections.   The setback was expected to increase pressure for elections forthe more powerful lower house of parliament. They are not due untilJuly 1990.   Voters decided half of the upper house's 252 seats in Sunday'sballoting.   Kyodo said Monday that its projections so far showed that theSocialists would win 42 seats and the Liberal Democrats 33.   Eleven seats were projected for the new labor-basedConfederation Group, eight for the Clean Government Party, threefor the centrist Democratic Socialists, three for the Communistsand the rest for independents and minor parties.   The Socialists needed to win 84 seats for a majority in theupper house but ran only 54 candidates, so they led efforts tocreate an opposition coalition with the Clean Government Party,Democratic Socialists and the Socialist Democratic Federation.   Final returns were expected Monday evening.   Without control of the upper house, the Liberal Democrats wouldfind it harder to pass legislation. The chamber can defeat bills,and it can delay but not veto the budget and diplomatic treaties.   A loss in the lower house also threatens the Liberal Democrats'hold on the prime ministry for the first time since the party wasformed in 1955. The lower house chooses the prime minister.   A heavy turnout by Japan's 90.3 million eligible votersreflected strong feelings over scandals and other issues that haveeroded the popularity of the Liberal Democrats.   Noboru Takeshita resigned as prime minister last month to takeresponsibility for the Recruit scandal, in which the Recruit Co.publishing conglomerate was accused of doling out millions ofdollars in underpriced stocks and political donations to obtainfavors.   Uno, Takeshita's successor, has been battered by allegationsthat for as long as 10 years he kept paid mistresses. He has notdenied the allegations but has denied he did anything immoral.   The accusations forced Uno to keep a low profile during thecampaign.   The Liberal Democrats also have suffered because farmers,traditional supporters of the party, opposed government moves toopen Japan's agricultural market wider to imports.   The Socialists rallied voters against the new 3 percent salestax that was heavily backed by the governing party.   The Socialists, putting forward a record number of womencandidates, took advantage of homemakers' anger over the tax, whichwas bulldozed through Parliament by the Liberal Democrats last yeardespite an opposition boycott. The tax took effect April 1.   Although Ms. Doi is immensely popular, her party has been widelyaccused of lacking a realistic and unified platform, partly becauseof a small but radical faction.   In the past, it has called for Japan to disband its Self-DefenseForces and scrap the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, under which about64,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan.   Socialist leaders now say they would not immediately do awaywith the armed forces, and that they seek only to revise thetreaty. But Ms. Doi and others have said all U.S. warships enteringJapanese ports should be inspected and denied entry if nuclear armsare found.</TEXT></DOC>
