They will appear neither as the accused nor accuser in connection with history's biggest banking collapse, but as witnesses who have been subpoenaed to help a jury decide whether the banking concern's former auditors, Ernst andamp; Whinney, did shoddy audit work on Continental's 1981 financial statement.    The lawsuit is part of a massive 4 1/2-year-old shareholder action arising out of the losses that led to Continental's collapse in 1984.    The former chairman and chief executive officer, Roger E. Anderson, is expected to be called to testify, along with several of his subordinates and perhaps some fellow board members -- nearly all of whom have refused to speak publicly about their roles in Continental's downfall.    &quot;You'll get a revisit with the 1981-82 Continental management team in this case,&quot; promised Nicholas E. Chimicles, one of the lawyers who represents former shareholders. &quot;This is the ultimate audit.&quot;    The shareholders and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which bailed out Continental and took on most of its worst loans, are expected to seek several hundred million dollars from Ernst andamp; Whinney, lawyers close to the case said.    Mr. Chimicles and Lowell E. Sachnoff, a lawyer working for the FDIC, wouldn't comment on damages. The FDIC's cost of rescuing Continental is expected to exceed $1 billion. The FDIC inherited the claim against the auditors as part of the bailout.    The agency and former holders charge Ernst andamp; Whinney with massive failure in its audit of Continental's 1981 books. The following July, Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City was closed by federal regulators and Continental began disclosing that the $1 billion in oil and gas loans it bought from the smaller bank were mostly bad.    &quot;We stand behind our audit,&quot; an Ernst andamp; Whinney spokesman said. &quot;We didn't do anything wrong.&quot; Continental's government-appointed management team replaced the Cleveland-based firm in 1985 with Price Waterhouse.    Ernst andamp; Whinney's lawyer, Daniel F. Kolb, wouldn't comment. But in papers filed Friday in U.S. District Court here, he said the FDIC should be barred from any recovery because Continental officials withheld important information from the auditors, including a bank investigation that was underway at the time of personal loans made by Penn Square to Continental vice president John Lytle.    Mr. Lytle has since been indicted on wire and bank fraud charges and federal prosecutors have said the Penn Square loans were instead part of a kickback scheme. Mr. Lytle denied the charges.    Ernst andamp; Whinney contends that by keeping its original probe of the loans from its auditors, Continental interferred with the audit. The audit firm also will seek to hold Mr. Anderson and his crew responsible. &quot;Ernst andamp; Whinney did not run the bank, make loans, supply information for lending purposes, advise on business risk or render long-term economic forecasts,&quot; the firm's lawyers said. &quot;Ernst andamp; Whinney was no more and no less than Continental's auditor.&quot;    Mr. Anderson and the other individuals who were defendants in the shareholder and FDIC suits have settled, though insurance companies that wrote Continental's directors-and-officers liability policy are refusing to pay under the settlement. They say they, too, were misled by Continental management.    FDIC and shareholders' lawyers said in a filing Friday that they'll show that Ernst andamp; Whinney knew that Penn Square had been criticized by its own auditors and by regulators and -- because the Oklahoma Bank was responsible for much of Continental's rapid loan growth -- the auditors should have looked more carefully at the loans.    Also, they charge that Ernst andamp; Whinney's sampling of loans to test Continental's internal auditing didn't include any Penn Square loans or any loans made after August 31, 1981 -- though much of the loan growth for the year occurred after that time. </TEXT></DOC>
