The decision means that no new wells will be drilled thisyear in Canada's Beaufort Sea region, which leads into theArctic Ocean. Gulf Canada, an energy concern, is a unit ofToronto-based Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd., which iscontrolled by the Reichmann family. It had proposed to drillas many as four wells in the region over the next threeyears.</LP><TEXT>   Frank Mitton, manager of Gulf Canada's northernoperations, said the company will decide in the next fewmonths whether to carry out its plans to drill the remainingwells. Mr. Mitton said Gulf's decision to cancel the well wasunrelated to an earlier ruling by a Canadian environmentalpanel. The panel had recommended that the Canadian governmentreject Gulf's plans because the company was unprepared todeal with a major oil spill. &quot;We cannot drill the wellbecause we don't have sufficient industry support for it,&quot;Mr. Mitton said.   The well was to have been located about 18 miles east ofGulf Canada's big Amauligak oil field. Several oil and gasfinds have been made in the Beaufort Sea but none of thediscoveries has been brought into production.   Gulf is the second company that has canceled an Arcticexploration program this year. Amoco Canada Petroleum Co., aunit of Chicago-based Amoco Corp., recently canceled plans todrill two wells in the Beaufort Sea, because of insufficientinterest from its partners. Amoco plans to carry out someseismic work this summer.   Ed Zederayko, an oil industry analyst, said low energyprices and reduced federal government exploration incentivesare causing more companies to defer their offshore drillingplans.   But a spokesman for Chevron Canada Resources Ltd., whichwas to have held about 22% interest in Gulf's proposed well,said Chevron was committed to going ahead with the plan.Chevron Canada, a unit of San Francisco-based Chevron Corp.,&quot;has an ongoing interest in the North,&quot; he said.   The Canadian Environmental Impact Review Board hadrecommended earlier this month that government regulatorsreject Gulf Canada's Arctic drilling plan because of thepotentially devastating effects of an oil spill on the area'senvironmentally sensitive coastline. The board, which is madeup of representatives from the federal government, thegovernments of the Yukon and Northwest Territories and theWestern Arctic Inuit natives, criticized Gulf Canada and thegovernment for their &quot;startling lack of preparedness&quot; fordealing with a major oil well blowout.   Canada Oil and Gas Lands Administration, the governmentregulators, had yet to issue its decision on whether it wouldaccept the environmental board's ruling.   Gulf Canada officials estimated that a hypotheticalworst-case well blowout could release 40,000 barrels of oil aday for 66 days, or 10 times more oil than was released whenExxon Corp.'s Valdez tanker ran aground in Alaska last year.They said the cleanup of such a spill could be beyond GulfCanada's financial capabilities.</TEXT></DOC>
