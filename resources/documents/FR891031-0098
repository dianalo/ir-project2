Introduction</ITAG>On April 28, 1989, the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Midwest'' or ``Exchange'')submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or``SEC''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of1934 (``Act'') \1\<NOTE/> and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\<NOTE/> a proposed rule change \3\<NOTE/> designed to establish a Secondary Trading Session for theexecution of transaction in portfolios of securities through its new automatedPortfolio Trading System (``PTS'' or ``System'').\4\<NOTE/> Concurrent with its April 28, 1989 filing, Midwest filedwith the Commission's Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') a proposedtransaction reporting plan pursuant to Commission Rules 11Aa3-1 and 11Aa3-2under the Act.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4 (1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Additionally, Midwest stated that it intends to submitan application to the Commission's Division of Market Regulation for unlistedtrading privileges (``UTP'') pursuant to Section 12(f) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.andSection; 781(f). <T3>See </T3>letter from J. Craig Long, Vice President and General Counsel,to Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, datedApril 27, 1989 (``April 27 letter''). Specifically, Midwest will applyfor UTP in those securities which comprise a part of the Standard and Poor's(``Sandamp;P'') 500 Index and which Midwest does not trade currently pursuantto UTP.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Amendment No. 1, submitted by the Midwest on May 31, 1989,deletes changes to Article XX, Rule 12 and Article XXI, Rules 2, 3, 4,8, 9, 12 and 13 as proposed in the Exchange's original filing submittedon April 28, 1989. Amendment No. 1 also adds an Interpretation and Policy,to be set forth in Article VIII, Rule 9 of the Midwest's Rules, that clarifiesthe application of the Exchange's off-board trading restrictions to membertransactions in securities traded on the Exchange. In particular, the Interpretationand Policy clarifies that implementation of the Midwest's proposed SecondaryTrading Session will not prohibit members from effecting transactions insecurities listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on the Exchange,where the member acts as principal or agent, on any organized exchange,or over-the-counter market in any foreign country, outside of the tradinghours of the Exchange's Primary Trading Session.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 17 CFR andSection;andSection; 240.11Aa3-1 and 240.11Aa3-2(1989). The Midwest also has requested an exemption from the requirementsof paragraph (b)(2)(viii) of Rule 11Aa3-1 for transactions effected throughthe System. <T3>See </T3>letter from J. Craig Long, Midwest, to Mary Revell, BranchChief, SEC, dated September 12, 1989.Notice of the proposed rule change was provided by the issuance of a Commissionrelease (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26887, June 2, 1989), andby publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 24779, June 9, 1989). The Commission receivedone comment on the proposed rule change.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See </T3>notes 21-24, <T3>infra </T3>and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of the Proposal</ITAG>A. PTS Product Description and Market StructureProposed Midwest Rule 10(b), Article IX would establish a Secondary TradingSession to be conducted from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time (4:30p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time) for the limited purpose of permittingthe execution of transactions in qualified portfolios of equity securitiesthrough the PTS.\7\<NOTE/> The rules governing the Secondary Trading Session are tobe set forth in a new Article XXXV of the Midwest's Bylaws.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The Primary Trading Session currently is conducted onthe Floor of the Exchange from 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Central Time.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The Article XXXV Rules apply to Exchange contracts madeon the Exchange during the Secondary Trading Session. Except to the extentthat specific Article XXXV Rules govern, or unless the context otherwiserequires, the provisions of Midwest's Constitution and all other rulesand policies of the Board of Governors are applicable to the executionof portfolio transactions through the PTS.The Midwest's Floor will not be open during the Secondary Trading Session.Rather, all qualified portfolio transactions will be executed through thePTS, an automated, screen-based trading system maintained by Midwest. Exchangemembers will be permitted access to the PTS through dial-up modems, butExchange specialists, odd-lot dealers and registered market makers maynot participate as such during the Secondary Trading Session.The Midwest's Secondary Trading Session is limited to transactions in portfoliosof ``Eligible Securities.'' These are defined in proposed Rule 2(d), ArticleXXXV as all securities that are listed for trading on the Exchange or towhich UTP have been granted. The Midwest's Secondary Trading Session willallow portfolio transactions in both ``standardized portfolios'' and ``non-standardizedportfolios''. Proposed Rule 2(a), Article XXXV defines the term ``standardizedportfolios'' as any group of Eligible Securities that are the subject ofan option contract traded on a national securities exchange or a futurescontract traded on a contract market designated by the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission. Rule 2(b) defines a ``non-standardized portfolio''as any group of Eligible Securities consisting of at least 20 securities,where the value of any one security does not exceed 20 percent of the contractprice of the shares in the portfolio as executed.Proposed Midwest Rule 9, Article XXXV establishes objective and subjectivepricing parameters for stock portfolio transactions executed through thePTS. Using the last reported price after the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'')close for each of the securities comprising a portfolio as reported onthe Consolidated Transaction Reporting System or the NASDAQ TransactionReporting System on the day the portfolio transaction is to be executed,the price at which the portfolio transaction is executed may not be lessthan 95% or greater than 105% of the aggregate value of the securitiescomprising the portfolio. Additionally, proposed Rule 9, Article XXXV specifiesthat the price of each security comprising a portfolio may not be lessthan 90% or greater than 110% of the last reported price for that security.Furthermore, the price at which a portfolio transaction is executed, bothin the aggregate and on a security-by-security basis, must be fair, takinginto consideration all relevant circumstances, including market conditionswith respect to such security or securities at the time of the transaction,the expense involved, and the fact that the member or member organizationis entitled to a profit. Upon application by a member or member organization,Rule 9 permits an officer of the Exchange to exempt transactions on a case-by-casebasis from the operation of the objective portfolio pricing parameters.Under proposed Rule 5, Article XXXV, bids or offers in portfolios enteredinto the PTS must be made in minimum increments of $.01. Bids or offersin Eligible Securities comprising a portfolio must be made in incrementsof 1/10,000 of a dollar per share.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The Midwest has stated that the relatively small portfoliovaluation increments were chosen to reflect current business practice:customers price a portfolio to the nearest cent, and then allocate theportfolio's dollar value to each stock in the portfolio. In allocatingthe portfolio's value to the stocks, customers may need to use a fractionof a cent to value each stock.B. PTS Order Entry and Trading Rules<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Acceptable Orders</ITAG>All qualified protfolios traded in the PTS are deemed to consist of a singleunit of trading, which is comprised of the number of shares of each securityin the portfolio as specified in the bid and offer. All bids and offersentered into the PTS are deemed to be firm quotations to buy or sell theportfolio at the stated price as if made available for an individual securityin accordance with Rule 11Ac1-1 under the Act.\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ Midwest Rule 6(a), Article XXXV.Only orders for portfolios may be executed during the Secondary TradingSession. No other orders for the purchase or sale of securities will beaccepted for execution. Any orders for the purchase or sale of securitiesentered in Midwest's Primary Trading Session that remain unfilled at theclose will be held over for execution during the next Primary Trading Sessionand will not be executed during the Secondary Trading Session. Thus, therewill be no interaction between orders in individual securities left openat the end of the Primary Trading Session and portfolio executions thattake place during the Secondary Trading Session.A personal computer (``PC'') may be used for order entry into the PTS.A member or member organization may make a bid or offer to purchase orsell a portfolio by entering into the System the total value of the portfolio,the symbol and quantity of all eligible securities comprising a non-standardizedportfolio, and the settlement terms of other than ``regular way'' transactions.In the event that an Exchange member or member organization attempts totrade a portfolio that contains a non-eligible security. a PTS systemscheck would disallow the input, and generate a rejection. Similarly, ifa portfolio did not meet the standards for concentration and issue composition,the PTS would generate a rejection.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Price Protections and Order Execution</ITAG>Members may enter crossed orders or unmatched bids and offers into thesystem. When crosses are entered, the System will first search all unmatchedorders to determine whether there is an order in the System for the sameportfolio at the same or a better price. If there is no better quotation,the cross will be executed, provided the transaction price is within theapplicable pricing parameters.\1\\1\<NOTE/> If there is a better quotation, the cross will not be permittedand a message to that effect will be sent to the member attempting to effectthe transaction.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ <T3>See </T3>April 27 letter, <T3>supra </T3>note 3.If an unmatched bid or offer is entered, and the member or member organizationwished to sell a specific portfolio at a price equal to or lower than apublished bid, or it wishes to buy a specific portfolio at a price equalto or higher than a published offer, then Rule 6(b), Article XXXV requiresthe member or member organization to ``satisfy'' such a pre-existing quotationprior to executing any order at that price. The member could then contactthe other side and personally negotiate a price at which the transactionan take place, because PTS does not operate as an order interaction system.One of the two members would then enter a matched bid and offer into thesystem for execution.An Exchange member or member organization that has accepted for executionan order to purchase or sell a portfolio of securities on behalf of a customerthrough the PTS cannot fill the order by selling or purchasing such portfoliofor its own account if it is holding an unexecuted order on behalf of anothercustomer to sell or purchase a portfolio at the same or a better price.\1\\2\<NOTE/> Similarly, no Exchange member or member organization thathas accepted an order to purchase or sell a portfolio of securities onbehalf of a customer through the PTS may fill such an order by sellingor purchasing such portfolio for its own account or the account of a customer,if another member or member organization has entered a quotation into theSystem to sell or purchase such a portfolio at the same or a better price.\1\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ Midwest Rule 8(a), Article XXXV. This rule is designedto address concerns raised by the conflict of interest that may arise becauseof the intersection of a member firm's customer and proprietary tradingoperations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ Midwest Rule 8(b), Article XXXV.When a bid or offer is accepted over the phone by another member or memberorganization, the portfolio transaction must be executed in accordancewith Rule 7, Article XXXV. In order to execute an order, a member or memberorganization must enter into the System a matched bid and offer for a portfolio.\1\\4\<NOTE/> An Exchange member or member organization must then enterspecified information describing the executed portfolio transaction intothe System.\1\\5\<NOTE/> If a bid or offer is not accepted in any given SecondaryTrading Session, then the bid or offer will be retained for the next SecondaryTrading Session, unless it is a day order.\1\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Portfolio transactions between Exchange member or memberorganization or between members and their customers must be entered intothe System by only one member or member organization. Midwest Rule 7(a),Article XXXV.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ An executed portfolio transaction must be accompaniedby the following items of information: (1) the name of the executing memberor member organization and its Exchange symbol; (2) the name of the clearingmember or members, if not the entering member; (3) the symbol, quantityand price, in decimals, for each security in the portfolio; (4) the totalvalue of the portfolio; and (5) the settlement terms, if other than ``regularway.'' Midwest Rule 7(b), Article XXXV. Upon entry of this information,an Exchange contract will be made for each security comprising the portfolio;(4) the total value of the portfolio; and (5) the settlement terms, ifother than ``regular way.'' Midwest Rule 7(b), Article XXXV. Upon entryof this information, an Exchange contract will be made for each securitycomprising the portfolio.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ Midwest Rule 4(a), Article XXXV.C. Transaction ReportingPlan  The Midwest has filed a transaction reporting plan (``Plan'') that is limitedspecifically to portfolio transactions executed during the Exchange's SecondaryTrading Session.\17\<NOTE/> Pursuant to the Plan, when a portfolio is executed throughthe PTS, Midwest will disseminate real-time transaction reports for theportfolios, but not for the individual securities that comprise the portfolios,from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., Central Time (the hours of the Secondary TradingSession), on all trading days.\18\<NOTE/> The Exchange will make available to vendors and subscribers:(1) the aggregate price of the portfolio; and (2) the symbol and quantityfor each security comprising the portfolio.\19\<NOTE/> At the end of each Secondary Trading Session, Midwest willprovide to news vendors and subscribers a report on the aggregate numberof shares of each of the securities purchased and sold during that session,as well as aggregate System volume.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27385 (October 26, 1989)(Commission order approving Midwest Plan and exemptions from certain requirementsof Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ However, Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act requires that transactionsin the individual securities be reported. Thus, by separate order the Commissionhas granted Midwest an exemption from this requirement. <T3>See supra </T3>note 17.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ The Plan also provides the terms of access for vendorswho wish to retransmit the data. The Plan provides for no vendor fees foraccess to the information but would require subscribers to pay ``appropriate''fees for receipt of the data. The Commission notes that any fees establishedby the Midwest that would be charged to PTS subscribers must be filed withthe Commission.  The Plan submitted by the Midwest does not provide for the consolidationof transaction reports from other markets trading the same securities.The Commission has decided to gant Midwest a temporary exemption, for sixmonths, from the requirement in Rule 11Aa3-1 that the Plan provide a mechanismfor the consolidation of last sale data on these securities with last saledata from other markets trading the same securities. While the Commissionis aware of the limited usefulness of price information on the underlyingsecurities in a portfolio transaction executed during Midwest's SecondaryTrading Session, it believes that dissemination of the share volume inthe underlying securities is important information that should be includedin the daily consolidated volume for each of the underlying securities.This presents a number of technological difficulties for Midwest, however,and the Commission has therefore decided to grant a temporary exemptionfrom this requirement to allow Midwest adequate time to make the necessaryarrangements to have this volume data included in the end-of-day consolidatedvolume.\20\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ <T3>See </T3>Midwest Plan approval order, <T3>supra </T3>note 17. D. Fees  For portfolio transactions executed through the PTS, proposed Rule 13,Aticle XXXV imposes transaction fees equal to the greater of $100 per portfoliotransaction or $.025 per $1,000 valuation. Midwest members and member organizationsthat elect to participate in PTS are required to pay a monthly fee of $2,500,payable quarterly in advance. The monthly access fee will be reduced byan amount equal to the amount of transaction fees such member or memberorganization pays.  E. Purpose and Benefits  Midwest has proposed its Secondary Trading Session to permit the efficientexecution of transactions in portfolios of securities subject to the regulatoryoversight of the Midwest. The Exchange contends that the Secondary TradingSession is designed to address some of the effects of NYSE Rule 390, whichgenerally prohibits a NYSE member, or any broker or dealer affiliated witha NYSE member, from effecting any transaction in most NYSE-listed securitiesas a principal in the over-the-counter market or from acting as agent ofboth parties in an over-the-counter transaction. Because these prohibitionsare not applicable to transactions effected in any foreign country outsideof NYSE trading hours, many brokers for large institutional investors inportfolios of securities that desire to execute transactions based on theclosing prices of securities on the NYSE effect such transactions off-shore,usually in London.  The Exchange contends that these overseas execution procedures are unsatisfactoryfrom several viewpoints. First, these transactions take place without thebenefit of exchange oversight and without the regulatory protection affordedparticipants in U.S. security markets. In addition, such transactions arenot reported to the public. Thus, issuers, the investing public and theregulatory agencies responsible for the oversight of the markets are deprivedof important information regarding trading activity in various securities. The Midwest believes that the Secondary Trading Session will permit broker-dealersto execute transactions in portfolios rapidly through the PTS automatedtrading system maintained by Midwest, and will provide disclosure to thepublic of trade information concerning such transactions. In addition,the Midwest notes that it will maintain a complete audit trail of all transactionseffected in the Secondary Trading Session, permitting the Commission andthe Midwest to monitor better the after-hours institutional market.  As discussed above, there will be no interaction between orders in individualsecurities left open on Midwest during the Primary Trading Session andportfolio executions during the Secondary Trading Session. The Exchangeclaims that this aspect of the System is a necessary consequence of thelimited trading environment being supported during the Secondary TradingSession. The PTS is not designed or intended to be an after-hours automatedexecution system for individual securities and small groups of securities.Midwest states that at the present time it is not prepared to advocatean off-floor, electronic trading mechanism for these types of orders, whichcan benefit from open outcry or widespread dissemination of firm quotationsreflecting buying and selling interest.  Integration of orders from the Primary Trading Session into the SecondaryTrading Session also would require fundamental changes in the way limitorders are handled. Brokers that do not want their customers' orders tobe executed after hours would have to mark those orders or withdraw themprior to the close of the Primary Trading Session. Customers would be facedwith the decision whether to obtain an after-hours execution or wait untilthe opening of the Primary Trading Session the following day when therecould be an even greater price movement.  Finally, the Exchange contends that its proposed price allocation processmakes the entire notion of order interaction somewhat specious. Under itsproposed rules package, individual stock prices have the potential to beset derivatively so long as they are within the applicable pricing parametersset forth in Rule 9, Article XXXV. Therefore, the Exchange believes thatit would be inappropriate to initiate order executions based on that price.Similarly, if individual stock orders could interact with portfolios, brokerswould have the incentive to change their individual stock price allocationin order to avoid this result.In order to accommodate trading in the System, Midwest has requested exemptiverelief from the operation of Commission Rules 10a-1 and 11Aa3-1 as theywould otherwise apply to portfolio trading through the PTS during the SecondaryTrading Session. The Exchange believes that these rules would impede theoperation of the alternative trading procedures that govern trading throughthe PTS during its Secondary Trading Session without providing any regulatorybenefits.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Comments Received</ITAG>The Commission received one comment on the proposed rule change from theAlliance of Floor Brokers (``AFB''),\21\<NOTE/> whose membership is comprised predominantly of NYSE floorbrokers. In general, the AFB comment letter argues that in comparison toexisting equity market trading procedures, the unequal regulatory treatmentenvisioned by the Secondary Trading Session and the supporting System wouldresult ultimately in a fragmented securities market structure with increasedmarket volatility. The AFB questions the Midwest's rationale supportingits proposed rule change, as well as the overall need for the SecondaryTrading Session.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Michael D. Robbins, President, AFB, to JonathanG. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated August 18, 1989.The AFB also levels more specific criticisms at the Exchange's proposal.For example, the AFB contends that the pricing mechanisms that govern stockportfolio trading during Midwest's Secondary Trading Session do not providefor sufficient price transparency, order interaction and ultimate pricebetterment. Furthermore, the AFB comments that the Secondary Trading Session'sproposed crossing rules do not consider adequately the ``price conditionality''\22\<NOTE/> of some proposed cross transactions, nor do the portfoliopricing parameters account adequately for the possibility of severe pricevariances from closing prices that may result from the proposed price parametersthat would govern Midwest's Secondary Trading Session. The AFB also criticizedthe Midwest's proposed Plan for reporting trades executed during the SecondaryTrading Session.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ A proposed cross transaction may be ``price conditional''to the extent that one or both sides of the trade would delay executingthe cross at the market in the hope that a better execution price may befound in other buying or selling interest.The AFB believes that Midwest's Secondary Trading Session may exacerbateexisting structural market risks because of the unequal regulatory treatmentaccorded transactions in PTS portfolios and regular way transactions inindividual securities. The AFB particularly criticizes the exemption tothe short selling rule that would apply during the Secondary Trading Session.The AFB argues that in comparison to existing equity procedures, shortselling during the Secondary Trading Session would result ultimately ina fragmented securities market structure with increased market volatility.The Exchange responded to the AFB's concerns and other issues raised byCommission staff in a letter to Commission staff.\23\<NOTE/> The letter addressed the market structure and regulatoryconcerns raised by the proposal and explained further the rationale forimplementing a Secondary Trading Session for executing portfolio transactions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ <T3>See</T3> letter from J. Craig Long, General Counsel, Midwest, to JonathanG. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated September 11, 1989.In its letter the Exchange notes that its Secondary Trading Session isstructured with the goal of providing institutional customers and memberfirms with a trading vehicle that allows a largely institutional composite-assetmarket to rebalance stock portfolios after the NYSE close to reflect thelast reported sale on the consolidated transaction reporting system. TheExchange believes that the rules supporting its Secondary Trading Sessionare designed appropriately to accommodate the particular needs of its marketniche in a fair and competitive market structure. Finally, Midwest believesthat it proposal will result in improvements in the areas cited by theAFB by bringing a share of the after-hours institutional market in portfoliotransactions under the auspices of the Commission and Exchange oversightand by requiring transactions to be reported.The Exchange also answers the AFB's specific criticisms. In response tothe concern raised by the AFB that the proposed price parameters affordtoo much leeway in pricing portfolio transactions, the Exchange statedthat it believes that the flexibility in its proposed price parametersare necessary to accommodate institutional trading in a composite-assetmarket where stock transactions with otherwise separate executions areexecuted in aggregated portfolios at a single price, and will thereforeallow parties to a portfolio transaction to price portfolios in responseto the buying and selling interest of their customers, as well as respondto changed market conditions after the close of regular trading. The Exchangecontends that the price limits assure that the execution prices of a portfolioand its component securities will be fair and consistent with prevailingmarket conditions and fundamental corporate valuations.In response to the AFB's criticism of the proposed crossing proceduresfor the Secondary Trading Session, Midwest notes that its Secondary TradingSession will permit matched orders to be crossed only if there is not anunmatched order in the PTS at the same or a better price. Citing the CincinnatiStock Exchange's (``CSE'') National Securities Trading System (``NSTS'')as an example,\24\<NOTE/> the Exchange claims that its PTS provides the same levelof order interaction and price competition approved by the Commission inother electronic trading systems.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ The CSE's NSTS is a system of users linked electronically,which executes orders automatically. For a general discussion of CSE'sNSTS, <T3>see generally</T3> SEC, Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break</T3> at 7-40 (February 1988).Midwest responded to the AFB's critique of the proposed transaction reportingplan for trades executed during the Secondary Trading Session by emphasizingthat its Secondary Trading Session represents a marked improvement overcurrent market practices, where overseas portfolio transactions are notreported either to the Commission or the public. Under Midwest's proposedtransaction reporting plan for its Secondary Trading Session, real timeportfolio transaction reports will be disseminated to vendors and subscribersalong with aggregate shares traded. Thus, the Exchange notes that the investingpublic will no longer be deprived of important information regarding portfoliotrading activity in various securities.Finally, the AFB suggested that the Secondary Trading Session is susceptibleto manipulation of individual securities and insider trading abuses. Inresponse, the Exchange emphasizes that the lack of a price effect for theindividual stocks that comprise a portfolio and the Exchange's detailedsurveillance procedures will deter and capture any trading abuses.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion</ITAG>A. IntroductionAfter careful consideration of the comments received, applicable statutoryprovisions, and relevant policy considerations, the Commission concludesthat Midwest's proposed Secondary Trading Session is designed appropriatelyto prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote justand equitable principles of trade, provide for an equitable allocationof fees, and is consistent with the maintenace of fair and orderly markets,an open and competitive national market system, and the ability of a nationalsecurities exchange to enforce compliance with its rules. For these reasonsand for the additional reasons set forth below, the Commission finds thatapproval of the Exchange's proposed rule change relating to a SecondaryTrading Session is consistent with the requirements of the Act and therules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,and, in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b).\25\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ 15 U.S.C. andSection;andSection; 78f(b) (1982).Over the past several years the use of composite-asset trading techniquesand strategies by institutional investors has increased substantially.Both the stock exchanges and private information vendors have developedproducts to facilitate the trading of portfolios of securities.\26\<NOTE/> In addition, broker-dealers have used exchanges-for-physicals(``EFPs'') \27\<NOTE/> to satisfy their customers' needs in this area. The Midwestsystem is another attempt to provide a program trading service for institutionalinvestors. The Commission agrees with Midwest that the Secondary TradingSession may provide a useful means for executing portfolio trades in U.S.securities that currently are being executed overseas. Moreover, the Systemmay be helpful in soliciting contra-side interest for portfolios orders.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27383 (October26, 1989) (Commission order approving File No. SR-NYSE-89-05, a proposedrule change submitted by the NYSE designed to enable the trading of standardizedbaskets of stocks at an aggregate price in a single execution on the NYSEfloor); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27383 (October 26, 1989) (Commissionorder approving File No. SR-CBOE-88-20, a proposed rule change submittedby the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'') also designed to enablethe trading of standardized baskets of stocks at an aggregate price ina single execution on the CBOE floor); and letter from Brandon Becker,Associate Director, Division of Market Regulations, SEC, to Lloyd H. Feller,Esq., Morgan Lewis and Bockius, dated July 28, 1987 (Commission no-actionletter issued under Sections 5 and 6 of the Act on behalf of request byJeffries and Co., Inc. to implement a computerized order entry mechanismto allow for trading customized portfolios of stocks at a single price).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ An EFP generally may be defined as the exchange of along (short) futures position for an equivalently valued long (short) stockposition. This normally takes place after the NYSE close and is completedin accordance with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') regulations.In the CFTC Division of Trading and Markets <T3>Report on Exchanges of Futures for Physicals,</T3> dated October 1,1987 (``CFTC Report''), an EFP was defined as ``a transaction in whichone party buys the physical commodity and simultaneously sells (or givesup a long) futures contract. The price of the exchanged futures position,the quantity of the futures and cash commodity, and other terms are privatelynegotiated by the parties rather than being competitively executed in thepit.'' CFTC Report at 2. The CFTC has interpreted Section 4c(a) of theCommodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. andSection; 6c(a), and CFTC Regulation 1.38,17 C.F.R. andSection; 1.38, to permit individual contract markets, such asthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange, to establish rules permitting and governingEFP transactions.As described below, the Commission also believes that the market structureMidwest has designed to support its Secondary Trading Session balancesappropriately the competing concerns of various Exchange constituenciesand its institutional clientele in a manner consistent with just and equitableprinciples of trade. Given the institutional character of stock portfoliotrading that the Secondary Trading Session is designed to capture, theCommission agrees that the Exchange's chosen market structure, which accordsprice protections and trade reporting, as well as the benefits of Commissionand Exchange oversight pursuant to the Act, is a fair and competitive marketstructure. Furthermore, the Commission believes that Midwest's SecondaryTrading Session will not, as the AFB contends, lead unduly toward a morefragmented and volatile market. The Secondary Trading Session respondsto existing demand for a means to effect portfolio trades at an aggregateprice reflective of the market closing prices of the component securities.By definition, these transactions will not occur during regular equitytrading hours. The Secondary Trading Session offers the very real benefitsof trade reporting, consolidated surveillance, and pricing protectionswhich ensure that matched bids and offers do not ``trade through'' an unmatchedquotation.\2\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ The Commission's approval order issued today for theNYSE's basket proposal, <T3>supra</T3> note 26, addresses comments received by the AFB on thatproduct. The Commission incorporates its responses to the AFB's commentson the NYSE proposal to the AFB's comments on the PTS to the extent thatthe comments are the same for both proposals. B. Portfolio Pricing Parameters.As discussed above, each individual security in a portfolio traded in theSystem must be priced within a range of plus or minus 10% of the last reportedprice for that security on the day the portfolio transaction is executed,provided that the portfolio itself is priced within a range that is plusor minus 5% of the aggregate closing prices of the securities comprisingthe portfolio. Further, no one security shall consist of more than 20%of the contract price of the shares in a ``non-standardized portfolio''as executed. The Commission agrees with Midwest that the price parameters afford institutionsthe flexibility to price portfolio transactions executed during the Exchange'sSecondary Trading Session in response to changed market conditions, suchas currency movements after the close of regular equity trading hours,or because of differing estimates of equities' values. It would be unnecessarilyrigid to require that prices on the system reflect precisely the closingprices for the constituent securities in the Primary Trading Session. With respect to the AFB's concerns regarding the transparency of the PTSprice mechanism and the flexibility of the price parameters that governportfolio trading during the Secondary Trading Session, the Commissionrecognizes that although the individual prices allocated among the stocksthat comprise a protfolio are somewhat derivative, the plus or minus 10%price limit on an individual stock will operate as a reasonable limit onthe actual price variance that a particular stock may experience. Moreover,the additional plus or minus 5% price limit on the portfolio as a wholealso operates, on average,\2\\9\<NOTE/> as a further restriction on the discretion of pricing anindividual component stock. The Commission notes furthermore that proposedRule 9, Article XXXV requires all portfolio transactions executed duringthe Secondary Trading Session both in the aggregate and on a security-by-securitybasis to be fair, taking into consideration all the relevant circumstancesattendant to the transaction. The Commission believes Midwest's SecondarySession pricing parameters strike an appropriate balance between allowinginstitutions and Exchange members the flexibility to price transactionsaccording to economic fundamentals while restricting the ability of marketparticipants to effect trades at prices that do not benefit from open outcryor the widespread dissemenation of firm quotations during regular equitytrading hours. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ The Commission notes that the combination of the pricelimits and the different weighing of stocks in a portfolio accounts forthe sliding scale price mechanism as applied to individual stocks. C. OrderInteraction and Price Protections The Commission believes that Midwest's Secondary Trading Session's orderinteraction and price protecton rules are consistent with fair and orderlymarkets. First, Midwest's decision to deny order interaction between itsPrimary and Secondary Trading Sessions is reasonable to ensure that limitorders are not triggered by potentially unrepresentative prices of constituentsecurities executed after the close of the primary markets for those securities.The composite-asset nature of the portfolios traded over the System, combinedwith the fact that the Secondary Trading Session will operate in a discontinuousmanner, makes the prices of the individual securities less indicative ofthe prices obtained during the Primary Trading Session, and therefore notuseful triggers for limit orders. Second, because the PTS will permit matchedorders to be crossed only if there is not an unmatched order in the Systemat the same or a better price, the Secondary Trading Session's proposedcrossing rules provide an opportunity for price betterment and preservetime and price priority for portfolios. D. Transaction Reporting As described above, the Midwest has filed with the Commission a proposedPlan for reporting transactions executed during the Secondary Trading Session.The Midwest also has requested exemptions from certain requirements ofRule 11Aa3-1 under the Act for transactions executed through the System.Because the Commission agrees with Midwest that the proposed configurationfor transaction reporting during the Secondary Trading Session is appropriate,the Commission has issued a separate order approving the Plan and the exemptions.\3\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ <T3>See</T3> Midwest Plan approval order, <T3>supra</T3> note 17. E. Short Sale ExemptionThe Exchange has requested that the Commission grant an exemption fromRule 10a-1 under the Act 31<NOTE/> to facilitate transactions in the Secondary Trading Session.32<NOTE/> Rule 10a-1 provides that short sales 33<NOTE/> of exchange-listed securities may not be effected at a priceless than the price at which the immediately preceding sale was effected(``minus tick'') or at a price equal to the last sale if the last precedingtransaction at a different price was at a higher price (``zero-minus tick'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>31 17 CFR 240.10a-1 (1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>32 <T3>See</T3> letter from J. Craig Long, Vice President and General Counsel,Midwest, to Richard G. Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation,SEC, dated April 27, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>33 A short sale is defined in Rule 3b-3 under the Act, 17CFR andSection; 240.3b-3, as any sale of a security that the seller doesnot own or any sale that is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowedby, or for the account of, the seller.The Commission believes it is appropriate, particularly in view of theabsence of price reporting in the individual stocks comprising portfolios,to exempt transactions during Midwest's Secondary Trading Session fromthe operation of the short sale rule. Accordingly, the Commission's staffwill issue a letter granting appropriate relief from Rule 10a-1 with respectto such transactions.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusion</ITAG>Midwest's Secondary Trading System should improve the portfolio tradingprocess by providing a means to disseminate buying and selling interestfor portfolio orders. To the extent that Midwest's Secondary Trading Sessiondoes not integrate all segments of the securities markets, the Commissionagrees with Midwest that these departures are reasonably necessary to accommodatethe unique aspects of the PTS without deviating from the concept of fairand orderly markets. Finally, the Commission's Section 19 authority andthe Rule 19b-4 process allow the Commission and the Exchange sufficientflexibility to modify the rules governing portfolio trading on Midwestduring its Secondary Trading Session in light of actual trading experienceand any future developments that materially affect the Secondary TradingSession's market structure.34<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>34 The Commission notes that approval of the proposed rulechange is based upon a determination that the terms of Midwest's SecondaryTrading Session and the PTS are consistent with the requirements of theAct. If the terms of Midwest's Secondary Trading Session's market structureare changed in any material way, however, it would be necessary for theMidwest to submit a proposed rule change in order to afford the publican opportunity to review and comment on the proposed modification and forthe Commission to review its prior determination.Based upon the aforementioned factors, the Commission finds that the Exchange'sproposed rule change relating to the after-hours trading of stock basketsis consistent with the requirements of Sections 6(b) (4) and (5) of theAct and the rules and regulations thereunder.It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,35<NOTE/> that the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>35 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
