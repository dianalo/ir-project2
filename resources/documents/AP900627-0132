She's got to have the board ofdirectors of various banks decide whether to give her the $25million.''   John Scanlon, a spokesman for Mrs. Trump, said she had no plansto drop her lawsuit demanding half of her debt-ridden, estrangedhusband's assets. She is contesting a premarital agreement thatreportedly would give her $25 million, plus a $7 million mansion.   ``It was only a few months ago, when Mr. Trump's maritalproblems were making news, that the general opinion was that hiswife, Ivana, had made a bad deal when she agreed to take only $25million in case of a divorce,'' observed The New York Times. ``Thatno longer seems so paltry.''   ``She's painted into a corner; there are a lot of creditors whohave to be paid,'' said Felder. ``If I were her adviser, I wouldtell her, `You have a wonderful world to conquer.' All the glitterhas gone out of Trump and now is floating around her.''   In fact, Felder suggests that the timing is right for Mrs. Trumpto cash in on her own cachet: for instance, as a spokeswoman for acosmetics firm.   Whether Mrs. Trump gets wind of Felder's advice or not, heraccountants should be relieved that it's free. The flamboyantdivorce lawyer, who has represented the ex-wives of Mike Tyson, MelBrooks, Martin Scorsese and Robin Leach, among others, charges $500an hour.   ``She's had a significant number of offers for businessopportunities in the licensing field and product endorsements,''said Scanlon. ``Right now, she's getting her children settled forthe summer. She'll look at those in the fall.''   Mrs. Trump's own attorney, Michael Kennedy, doesn't discuss hercase with reporters. It's public knowledge, though, that a group ofbanks will closely monitor Donald Trump's personal and businessdealings for years to come as a condition of a $65 million bailoutannounced Tuesday.   The banks crimped the family's monthly allowance to $450,000 andwill pare it to $300,000 by 1992. In comparison, Trump reportedlyhad $583,000 in personal expenses in May _ not counting the$841,000 maintenance on his boat and the $246,000 upkeep on hisprivate plane.</TEXT></DOC>
