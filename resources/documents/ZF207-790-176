 But when several chefs are in the kitchen, competitionfor the oven can get quite fierce indeed.andM;Project-management software users are finding that the same principle appliesto balancing multiple projects.andP;  More stringent requirements are placed onproject-management software when several projects are overseen by differentmanagers than when one person is responsible for all the projects.andM;&quot;Programs that keep all projects physically in one file are only adequatewhen one project manager has direct responsibility for more than oneproject,&quot; explained Daniel Yahdav, president of 1 Soft Decision Inc. in SanRafael, Calif., and author of PM Solutions, a decision-making tool forselecting project-management software.andM;Yahdav cited Time Line, from Symantec Corp. of Cupertino, Calif., andInstaPlan, from InstaPlan Corp. of Mill Valley, Calif., as examples ofpackages that can handle multiple projects in a single file.andM;Brian Scarlett, director of publishing systems at Houghton-Mifflin Corp., aBoston-based book publisher, concurred with Yahdav's assessment.andP;  &quot;TimeLine's outlining capability lets you easily group and summarize all the tasksin a project.andP;  Summarizing is not quite as straightforward with otherPC-based project-management packages we have used.&quot;andM;&quot;Since all information for several projects must be contained in one file,volume limitations can become extremely important,&quot; Yahdav warned.andP;  &quot;Apackage with a limit of 1,000 activities per project will handle at best onlyfive projects with an average of 200 activities each.&quot;andM;When different project managers must supervise each project, a company may bebetter off with software that maintains projects in separate files.andP;  Someexamples of these programs are SuperProject Expert by Computer AssociatesInternational Inc., Plantrac from ComputerLine Inc. and Project Scheduler 4from Scitor Corp.andP;  Yahdav identified two key criteria for judging this typeof software: strength of cross-project reporting and the ability to levelresources across independent projects.andM;&quot;Some project-management programs can create reports that accumulateschedule, resource and cost information from different projects,&quot; Yahdavexplained.andP;  However, he said resource leveling -- moving tasks so that thetotal use of resources does not exceed the supply of resources -- must bedone manually.andM;&quot;At the most sophisticated level, each project is kept in a separate filewith independent activity coding, start/end dates and critical paths.andO;However, the program can automatically level a pool of resources shared bythe independent projects,&quot; Yahdav said.andM;The lack of flexibility in multiple-project reporting, Scarlett said, was onereason Houghton-Mifflin created a custom project-management program inFoxBASE, a database-management tool from Fox Software Inc. of Perrysburg,Ohio.andM;&quot;The mass-market PC-based project-management packages we've tried could notstructure a report so that different projects -- in our case, chapters orbooks -- are shown along one axis, and the steps such as 'first edit' and'galleys' that recur with each project are shown along the other axis,&quot; saidScarlett.andM;The publisher's aim, he said, was &quot;to create a report in which eachhorizontal line represents a different chapter and displays all the due datesfor the various steps involved in preparing a chapter for publication.&quot; Withthe program developed in FoxBASE, Scarlett can input data about any projectinto the database and then &quot;produce reports that 'slice and dice' theinformation exactly the way we want it.&quot;andM;&quot;It's hardly surprising that most PC project-management software do a poorjob at cross-project reporting,&quot; said David Bryan, an independentproject-management consultant based in Orleans, Mass.andP;  &quot;Even a simplecross-project report can be a difficult task for the DOS programmer becauseit involves keeping track of the information in [multiple files] and theopening and closing of several files.andP;  And opening and closing files can slowdown an application.&quot;andM;A LAN provides the best environment for taking advantage of multiple-projectcapabilities, Yahdav said.andP;  Each project manager can plan, track and maintainhis or her own schedules; the individual responsible for allocating resourcesacross the various projects can perform resource leveling on all the projectsat the same time.andP;  On a LAN, whenever a project file is updated, allschedules immediately reflect the changes in resource availability.andM;Joe Rizzo, president and CEO of Computer Aided Management Inc., the Petaluma,Calif., publisher of the project manager ViewPoint, explained another levelof complexity.andP;  &quot;With large companies today, it's very rare that a companyassigns people to work on only one project for the life of a project.andO;Instead, companies are organized so that managers have responsibility for agroup of people who do the same kind of work.&quot; An engineering manager, forexample, will make use of the work of people reporting to the fabricationmanager and vice versa in the course of overlapping projects, he said.andM;As a result, data security becomes an issue, Rizzo said.andP;  &quot;Noproject-management software implemented on a LAN today, including our own,allows a resource manager to update the use of resources under his or hercontrol but not those resources under the control of another manager.andP;  Weneed LAN password protection that distinguishes between managers who controlvarious resources, as well as managers who control different projects.&quot;andM;Computer Aided Management hopes to address this problem with OverView,network project-management software due next year that will extend the limitsof resource sharing.andM;Yahdav echoed Rizzo's sentiments about the need for security.andM;&quot;In the matrix form of organization,&quot; he said, &quot;there is a key differencebetween departmental supervisors responsible for overseeing the use of aparticular manpower resource and project managers who are responsible forkeeping a project on time and on schedule.andP;  This difference is not adequatelyrecognized in present-day project-management software.&quot;andM;----------Judy Housman is a WordPerfect certified instructor who consults onproject-management and personal information-management software.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
