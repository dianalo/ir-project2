But the theory isn't workingwith punitive damages.   Eight months after the high court grudgingly set broadconstitutional parameters for punitive damages, companiescontinue to fight consumers -- and other companies -- on alegal battlefield more murky than ever.</LP><TEXT>   Juries award punitive damages to punish and deter badconduct, typically as a supplement to compensatory damages,which reimburse plaintiffs for loss or injury. Since theSupreme Court's decision in March in Pacific Mutual LifeInsurance Co. vs. Haslip, some lower courts have invoked thecase to uphold multimillion-dollar punitive damage awards.But others have cited the Haslip case as a justification tothrow out big awards.   &quot;One way to read Haslip is the Supreme Court punting theissue back&quot; to state and federal judges, says Prof. GeoffreyMiller of the University of Chicago Law School. Lower-courtjudges may have caught the ball, but they are all running indifferent directions.   &quot;It's chaos,&quot; asserts Andrew Frey, a lawyer who representscompanies before the high court. &quot;The Haslip opinion meansall things to all people and nothing to anybody.&quot; Corporate,insurance and medical interests have pressured Congress andstate legislatures to limit damage awards, but they have hadlittle success.   Now, business, bemoaning the continuing unpredictabilityof punitive damages, is pushing the Supreme Court to takeanother crack at limiting the awards. The high court tomorrowwill consider a petition filed by Mr. Frey, seeking review ofa $750,000 punitive verdict against an insurance companyfound to have improperly denied a $1,000 death benefit.   While the case could be accepted for review, legalscholars agree that it would be unusual for the high court toreconsider an issue so quickly -- especially one the justicesso clearly would prefer to avoid. And that's just fine withconsumer advocates and plaintiffs' lawyers.   Unpredictability &quot;is the beauty of punitive damages&quot;because it encourages companies to make safe products andfair deals, asserts Jeffrey White, associate general counselof the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. &quot;If thedefense interests are looking for a new, predictablestandard,&quot; Mr. White adds, &quot;it wasn't in Haslip, and thelower courts haven't found it.&quot;   Haslip involved an insurance agent whose&quot;misappropriation&quot; of premiums left a Birmingham, Ala., womanwithout health coverage when she went into the hospital. Shesued the insurance company, Pacific Mutual, and a juryawarded her $840,000 in punitive damages.   The Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the award, though itwas more than four times the amount of compensatory damagesassessed. That ratio &quot;may be close to the line,&quot; JusticeHarry Blackmun wrote for the majority, but &quot;it does not crossthe line into the area of constitutional impropriety.&quot; Infailing to explain what would cross the line, JusticeBlackmun in effect borrowed the famously ambiguous standardthat the late Justice Potter Stewart applied to obscenity: Ican't define it, but &quot;I know it when I see it.&quot;   Justice Blackmun acknowledged that the constitutionalguarantee of &quot;due process&quot; requires judges to review punitiveawards to ensure that they bear a &quot;rational relationship&quot; tothe wrong committed.   But, Justice Blackmun wrote, &quot;we cannot draw amathematical bright line between the constitutionallyacceptable and . . . unacceptable that would fit every case.&quot;In three other decisions over the past seven years, theSupreme Court had similarly refused invitations to curbpunitive damages.   At least eight lower courts have cited Haslip to affirmpunitive damage awards of $250,000 or more. The awards rangedfrom six times the amount of compensatory damages to a ratioof 750 to 1 in the case Mr. Frey is appealing. Somewhere inbetween was a $6.1 million punitive award in anasbestos-injury case; the federal appeals court in NewOrleans affirmed, even though the award was more than 20times the compensatory damages.   Several of the affirming courts hinted that they couldn'tmake much practical use of Haslip. The New Orleans appealscourt observed that the judicial review procedures in theasbestos case were &quot;not as extensive&quot; as those approved bythe Supreme Court in Haslip. Despite that, said the NewOrleans court, &quot;we cannot conclude . . . that the differenceresults in a due process violation.&quot;   In contrast, at least five lower courts have cited Haslipin reducing substantially or setting aside punitive awards. AMaryland state appeals court took Haslip quite seriously intossing out a $12.5 million punitive award in a contractdispute between two insurance companies. The Maryland court,stressing that the award exceeded 50 times the compensatorydamages in the case, concluded that if the award in Haslip&quot;came close to the line . . . this surely crosses that line.&quot;   Prof. Miller of the University of Chicago predicts thatthe Supreme Court will jump back into the punitive damagescontroversy only in &quot;a shock-the-conscience case, somethingreally extreme.&quot; Mr. Frey argues that his client, PrincipalFinancial Group, presents such a case. As in Haslip, aninsurance dispute from Alabama is involved.   Principal was sued when it refused to pay a $1,000 deathbenefit claimed by a Mobile woman upon the death of her24-year-old daughter. The company said that the daughterwasn't a &quot;dependent&quot; of the mother, as required under thepolicy. The mother, Barbara Thomas, insisted her ailingdaughter had been dependent on her. A jury agreed with Ms.Thomas and awarded her $1,000 in compensatory damages. Thejury tacked on $750,000 in punitive damages because Principalhad acted in &quot;bad faith.&quot;   In an emotional unsigned opinion, the Alabama SupremeCourt placed great emphasis on the sadness of a child'sdeath. &quot;Parents should not have to bury their children,&quot; thecourt said. Calling Principal's transgression &quot;at leastmoderately reprehensible,&quot; the court asserted that the jury'sverdict would have &quot;a minor impact&quot; on a defendant whose&quot;assets and profits are measured in billions of dollars.&quot; Thedecision cited Haslip as authority.   Three of the Alabama court's nine judges concurred butsaid the punitive damage ratio should have been lowered to200-to-1, with the rest of the award going to the state. Onejudge dissented.</TEXT></DOC>
