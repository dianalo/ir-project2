Therefore, to conserve energy and reduce the operatingcost, waste heat is recovered by combining a heat-exchange gas turbinecycle with closed organic Rankine cycle. A computer programme was madeto calculate parametrically the individual and combined cycle performances,namely the work and efficiency of each. The parameters considered were:gas turbine pressure ratio; maximum cycle temperature; fluid-air massratio; and type of working fluid. This analytical study shows that R113is the optimum choice because it gives the smallest, hence the most economical,size of turbo-expander. Maximum cycle temperature and pressure ratioare relatively the most important parameters. Economic analysis indicatesvery good rate of return on investment, related with heat recovery bycogeneration.</TEXT></DOC>
