(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man in a blue toll-taker's uniformcheerfully greeted motorists, made change and wrote receipts on abusy expressway for several hours before co-workers realized he wasan impostor.   ``He was actually pretty good,'' said Richard Gilkison, whonoticed when the stranger showed up bright and early to take15-cent tolls at the Crosstown Expressway Friday morning.   ``He'd collect for an hour or two, then take himself a littlebreak. He looked real professional, waving a flag and everything.''   Crosstown officials are accustomed to vagrants who shove paperor clothing into automatic bins, then run out to collect theblocked change, said toll manager Peter Bond. This man was a bitmore open, he said.   Instead of jail, police took the impostor to a homeless shelter.They did not publicly identify him.   Bond said the average daily take from each booth is about $265,much of which is collected by toll-takers during rush hour. He saidhe isn't sure how much money was collected during the Fridaymorning shift.   ``It's fascinating that he went to the trouble of wearing theuniform,'' said Laura Blaine, chairwoman of the Tampa-HillsboroughExpressway Authority. ``He could have just asked for a job.''</TEXT></DOC>
