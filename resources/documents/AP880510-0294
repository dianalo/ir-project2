The idea was unveiled Monday in a government-ordered study ofpossible alternatives to the current annual motor vehicle tax basedon engine size.   Mileage could be monitored with special counters connected tothe axle costing about 300 Swiss francs, or $215, each, the reportby a panel of financial experts said. Sweden already uses such asystem for diesel vehicles.   Similar Swiss measures are considered at least several yearsaway.   For example, the report said, the owner of a family car in theZurich area currently pays a yearly vehicle tax equivalent to about$330.
