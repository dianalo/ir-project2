 If you talk to Micro Tempuschairman Larry DeBoever, he'll tell you that, in large enterprises, thisconnectivity already exists, that what has been lacking is the software toleverage the connections.andP;  His company, already having written the firstgeneration of micro-to-mainframe links, is thus working closely withMicrosoft to provide Microsoft-based LANs with enterprise-wideinterconnectivity using the mainframe as the router or server.andM;Micro Tempus has recently introduced two products that use the mainframe asan integrating factor among multiple PC LANs.andP;  These products, the EnterpriseRouter and LAN Manager/MVS, respectively enable the mainframe to be used forconnecting and routing between LANs and allow the mainframe to betransparently used as a file server for LAN Manager LANs.andM;THE ENTERRISE ROUTER.andP;  The Enterprise Router running as a VTAM subsystem onMVS makes the mainframe a centralized routing point, replacing a network ofpoint-to-point bridges to connect LANs to each other.andP;  Communications are runusing existing SNA transportandM;Any authorized user on any local workstation or server can transparentlyconnect to any resource in the internet.andP;  The procedure is as follows:  Aclient requests a service.andP;  A local piece of the Enterprise Routerapplication takes the request from the Redirector and determines whether theresource being requested is on the LAN.andP;  If not, it sends it to the gatewayto the mainframe, which then routes it to the appropriate LAN (the mainframeretains a list of resources it knows about).andP;  The request could be, forexample, a Mail Slot, Named Pipe, or Net View of all printers, or it could bea document being sent to a remote printer.andM;The enterprise Router will initially use the DCA/Microsoft CommunicationsServer for LAN-to-host connectivity, with support for other gateway productspromised for the near future.andP;  The Enterprise Router supports LANs based onMicrosoft's LAN Manager or MS-Net, though its API enables providers of othernetworks or third parties to integrate other networks.andM;The enterprise Router's host component pricing will range from $22,300 to$34,500, with LANs connected to the host supported at a cost of $1,590 perconnection (each connection being able to support multiple servers).andP;  Theproduct is due to be shipped in the second quarter of 1990.andM;LAN MANAGER/MVS.andP;  While the enterprise Router uses the mainframe to connectremote LANs, LAN Manager/MVS is designed to allow the mainframe to playdirectly in the LAN environment.andP;  Running in the same VTAM subsystem as theEnterprise Router, LAN Manager/MVS makes the mainframe a LAN Manager server.andO;This addition to the LAN Manager suite will allow DOS and OS/2 clients totransparently use LAN Manager servers from micro to mini to mainframe,running OS/2, Unix, VMS, or MVS.andP;  While the initial uses are likely to bePC-to-file sitting on the host, DeBoever predicts that the next generation ofdistributed applications will emphasize local server-to-mainframecommunications.andM;LAN Manager/MVS is a port of the source code of Microsoft's LAN Manager 2.0.andO;Micro Tempus is targeting support for the 89 APIs that are defined in LM/X.andO;It is due early in 1991.andP;  No pricing information is available.andM;BIG SOLUTIONS.andP;  LAN Manager/370 and the Enterprise Router are not productsaimed at your average network configuration.andP;  Micro Tempus has initiallytargeted the Fortune 50, those companies with hundreds of LANs (mostlyToken-Rings) and centralized mainframe technology.andP;  However, the products arenot merely of interest to those with global needs and deep pockets.andP;  What isalso important is the recognition by Microsoft (through Micro Tempus) thatthe mainframe world exists and that it presents new opportunities as well asthe necessity for accommodation.andM;This is particularly true as it becomes apparent that the NetWare/LAN Managerwars of the '90s are becoming mirrors of the PC/MIS wars of the '80s.andO;According to DeBoever, it is precisely these major companies, generally tiedstrategically to IBM, that have made a commitment to LAN Manager as thestrategic platform for developing enterprise-wide distributed applications.andM;While NetWare continues its dominance of the PC LAN world, and is likely tocontinue to do so under Lotus (after all, who knows the PC software businessbetter?).andP;  LAN Manager's key role is more likely to be played on The largerplatforms with the larger applications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
