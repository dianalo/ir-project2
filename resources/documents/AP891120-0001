Amid bitter and at times personal debate, the House voted215-194 on a procedural move that effectively kept the restrictionsfrom being added to a $14.6 billion foreign aid bill. The measureincludes $533 million for Poland and Hungary, and military andeconomic support for U.S. friends and allies around the world.   The House then voted 310-107 to approve the foreign aid measureand sent it to the Senate, where a similar amendment was rejectedon a vote of 58-39. The Senate then approved the bill on a voicevote and sent it to Bush.   ``This is a terrible amendment,'' said Minority Leader Bob Dole,R-Kan. ``If we pass it, we reward the communist terrorists ... andpunish the democratically elected government.''   But the past week's violence in El Salvador appeared to havecreated a shift of roughly 20 votes in the Senate since the bodyvoted 82-18 Sept. 20 for military aid with no conditions.   Later, underscoring congressional outrage over last week'smurders of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter,the House approved a non-binding resolution asserting that bringingthe killers to justice would ``be instrumental in determiningcontinued U.S. support'' for El Salvador. The vote was 409-3.   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said lawmakers were coming underheavy pressure from Christian groups to take action against ElSalvador, including heavy lobbying and demonstrations at somemembers' district offices.   In Washington, the National Conference of Catholic Bishopsexpressed support for proposals ``to withhold substantial portionsof military aid while the performance of the Salvadoran governmentand military is tested.''   Opponents of U.S. aid heckled Bush during an appearance inChicago. Others, in Washington, repeatedly interrupted Senate floorproceedings, and Capitol police forcibly ejected several protestersfrom the chamber.   House action came just a few hours after Bush said a cutoff ofU.S. military aid to the new government of rightist PresidentAlfredo Cristiani would be ``absolutely unacceptable.'' A pitchedweeklong battle against the leftist FMLN guerrillas was windingdown Monday as the rebels withdrew from San Salvador into thecountryside.   ``There is a freely elected government doing their very besttrying to get protection from these Marxist-led guerrillas cominginto the center of the city, and we support President Cristiani inhis effort to restore order,'' Bush told reporters as he boardedAir Force One for a day of campaigning for GOP candidates.   ``This is not the time to undermine a fragile democracy that isunder attack ... It's totally unacceptable, and the day of theseMarxist attacks should end right now,'' Bush said.   ``My pitch is this: that we must not pull away from a freely,democratically elected government that had certification of thefreedom of those elections,'' he said.   Debate on aid to El Salvador demonstrated clearly that the newviolence in that Central American country, including the the sixJesuits and two apparent witnesses to the murders last week, hadreawakened long-dormant congressional tensions.   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., had proposed to add language that wouldhave held back 30 percent of this fiscal year's military moneyuntil after April 1 of next year. The stated intent was to keeppressure on the Salvadoran government to solve the Jesuit murders,which some believe are a result of the resurgence of right-wingdeath squads. The bill includes a cap of $85 million on militaryaid for the year.   In the Senate, another version of the amendment was proposed bySen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. It would have withheld 30 percent of themilitary aid until the killers of the priests were apprehended andbrought to trial.   ``To rush into this breech with this kind of amendment issuicide, gentlemen, for that country,'' argued Rep. Gerald Solomon,R-N.Y. ``This amendment is a selective response to a greattragedy.''   ``This is not a debate over who are the good guys and who arethe bad guys,'' countered Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., ``This is adebate over whether the United States has an obligation to assurethat taxpayer dollars are going to a government that protects humanrights.''   Bush said he had personally told Cristiani ``how strongly wefeel about the killings.''   ``And I told him that they must get to the bottom of it. I amconvinced they will. The people who did this, whether they comefrom the extreme left or the extreme right, pay the penalty,'' Bushsaid.   Bush had vetoed another version of the bill a day earlierbecause he objectd to two sections _ a family planning provisionopposed by anti-abortion forces and a ban on use of foreign aidmoney to persuade allies to do things that the United States cannotlegally do itself.   On the latter issue, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., worked out acompromise that would ban any ``quid pro quo'' with a foreigncountry in which U.S. aid money is traded for policy moves that areagainst the law in the United States. The compromise was morenarrowly drawn than an earlier version which the administrationcontended would have had a chilling effect on conduct by U.S.officials and diplomats.   Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., said that change was inadequate forthe administration, but that a second veto of the bill could beavoided by attaching a legislative ``fix'' to another bill, perhapsthe must-pass deficit-cutting measure expected to come up onTuesday.   On the abortion matter, a group of abortion-rights Housesupporters blasted the veto, with Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.,contending Bush acted because of a ``blind promise to the rightwing of the Republican Party, which is against family planning.''She said the rejected bill had included language that would haveprevented any of the disputed money from going to abortions.</TEXT></DOC>
