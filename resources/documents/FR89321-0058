In addition, it provides staff support to theU.S. Commissioner to the IWC and to the IWC Interagency Committee. Consistentwith these responsibilities, the Agency develops positions for implementationof the aboriginal/subsistence harvest of bowhead whales under Paragraph13 of the Schedule to the International Convention on the Regulation ofWhaling, December 2, 1946, 62 Stat. 1716, T.I.A.S. No. 1849 (entered intoforce, November 10, 1948). In order provide for review and comment by thepublic of the data upon which the U.S. positions are based, the followinginformation is provided: (1) The IWC catch level available for the U.S.aboriginal/subsistence bowhead whale harvest for 1988; (2) a summary ofavailable bowhead scientific information including estimates of currentpopulation level and annual recruitment rates; (3) a summary of informationon the nature and extent of aboriginal/subsistence need; (4) the levelof aboriginal/subsistence harvest limits which could be implemented domestically;and (5) notice of the availability of those documents reviewed by NOAAand relied on by the Administrator of NOAA in making his finding on therange of harvest limits. By this notice, NOAA is soliciting public commenton the proposed domestic implementation of the IWC bowhead whale catchlimit for 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">1. Catch Level </ITAG>At the 40th Annual Meeting of the IWC, Auckland, New Zealand, May 30-June3, 1988, the following catch limit was established for aboriginal/subsistencewhaling: ``the taking of bowhead whales from the Bering-Chukchi-BeaufortSeas stock by aborigines is permitted, but only when the meat and productsof such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption by theaborigines and further provided that: * * * For each of the years 1989,1990, and 1991, the total number of whales landed shall not exceed 41,except that in 1988, 1989 or 1990, any unused strikes up to a maximum of3 shall be transferred to the following year.'' (Schedule to the Convention,Paragraph 13(b)(1)(i).<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Scientific Information</ITAG>The IWC Scientific Committee agreed at the 1988 IWC meeting on an estimateof 7,800 (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 5,700 to 10,600) asthe current size of the bowhead whale population. Based on simulation analysisconducted by scientists at the 1988 IWC meeting, estimates were made ofthe number of animals that can be removed which will keep the populationat its current level. This is known as the replacement yield (RY) whichdefines the number of whales annually recruited into the population thatbalances the number of deaths that occur. (RY) values of 43 to 196 animalswere estimated for the range of population estimates of 5,700 and 10,600.The view of the IWC Scientific Committee was that estimates of replacementyield would be most appropriate for the population size of 7,800 resultingin a replacement yield of 56 to 192 bowheads.<ITAG tagnum="84">3. Aboriginal/Subsistence Need</ITAG>The Department of the Interior (DOI) conducted the last major analysisof the nature and extent of aboriginal/subsistence need for bowhead whalesand whaling in 1983 and the IWC adopted this method for quantifying needin 1986. The Department of Interior contracted a new study on the quantificationof subsistence and cultural need for bowhead whales in 1987 which was presentedat the 1988 meeting. The new study presented the cultural and subsistenceneed of the nine Alaska Eskimo whaling villages to take 41 landed bowheadwhales. This quantification of need used the same method of calculationaccepted by the IWC in 1986. This method derives the mean annual numberof bowhead whales landed per capita during a specified historical periodand multiplies this mean by the current Eskimo population of nine AlaskaEskimo whaling villages. The result of this calculation is the total numberof bowhead whales the nine Eskimo whaling villages need to land each yearin order to meet their cultural and subsistence need.When the IWC adopted this method of quantifying need, members of the IWCAboriginal Subsistence Subcommittee noted that the quantification was basedon a large but incomplete series of data on historical bowhead landings.It was also noted that the quantification used an inconsistent data baseperiod. The Department of the Interior Study was initiated to correct thesedeficiencies. To complete the series of data on historical bowhead whalelandings to the extent possible, the study undertook a comprehensive reviewof available published and unpublished sources of bowhead landings. Remaininggaps are unlikely to be significantly reduced with further searches forhistoric data on bowhead landings. The data resulting from this study alsopermitted the use of a consistent historical base period for the calculationof need. In the prior analysis, the base periods varied from 1940 to 1970and 1950 to 1970. The base period now begins in 1910, the year followingthe cessation of commercial whaling in the arctic, and ends in 1969, priorto the period of unusually high bowhead harvests in the unique economiccircumstances of the 1970s. Therefore, applying the additional landed bowheaddata and the longer base period to the accepted method of quantifying need,results in a current cultural and subsistence need of 41 landed whales.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Domestic Harvest Range</ITAG>The IWC management scheme for aboriginal/subsistence whaling provides (inSchedule paragraph 13(a)(2)): ``For stocks below the maximum sustainableyield (MSY) level but above a certain minimum level, aboriginal/subsistencecatches shall be permitted so long as they are set at levels which allowwhale stocks to move to the MSY level.'' Given the above stated estimatesof 56-192 whales recruited into the population annually, the aboriginal/subsistencecatch can be permitted so long as it is set at a level that allows thewhale stock to move to the MSY level.The catch limit for bowhead whales for 1989, established by the IWC, is44 strikes or 41 landed with up to 3 unused strikes from 1988 availablein 1989. The 1988 quota of 35 strikes was not met. Only 29 strikes wereused in 1988 which allows 3 strikes to be transferred forward to 1989.The number under consideration for the 1989 catch limit is 47 strikes or41 landed.<ITAG tagnum="84">5.
