As leading oil ministers begin gathering here to ponder excessive OPEC production rates, there is a growing conviction inside and outside the cartel that the so-called Committee of Five and Committee of Three will accomplish little at their meetings scheduled for tomorrow and Friday.    &quot;To use a Spanish saying, the dough isn't suitable for making bread,&quot; said a national oil company official in Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC.    Barring the remote possibility that the meetings will lead to a full-fledged OPEC conference, &quot;there is nothing these committees can do to compensate for the overproduction,&quot; added Keith Hamm, a director of London-based Petroleum Economics Ltd. and a consultant to some of the oil ministers.    In an interview yesterday, a senior OPEC official ruled out a conference of all 13 oil ministers, asserting that overproduction &quot;isn't that far out of hand.&quot; He said, however, that the five ministers from the two committees probably will follow up their meetings here by personally contacting governments of member countries producing beyond their quotas.    But a lack of meaningful official action -- outside of peer pressure on quota violators -- may be just the catalyst that OPEC needs to curb the overproduction for which this week's meetings were called. OPEC's failure to stem production would disappoint oil markets, experts say, causing spot and futures prices to fall from their premium levels relative to OPEC's official prices. That, in turn, would give oil buyers world-wide less incentive to purchase OPEC petroleum.    &quot;The (market) slide won't affect official prices,&quot; Mr. Hamm said, &quot;but it will trigger a response by buyers&quot; not to take OPEC oil.&quot;    Bryan Jacoboski, New York-based senior oil analyst for PaineWebber Inc. and a frequent attender of OPEC meetings, agreed that as spot prices come more into line with official prices, &quot;OPEC production will recede.&quot; Meanwhile, U.S. oil prices tumbled to below $19 a barrel on spot and futures markets amid signs that Iran is willing to negotiate a peace pact with Iraq.    Among the tasks facing OPEC's production watchdogs here is figuring out exactly how much excess oil cartel members are producing. When OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria called this week's meetings, he estimated that total production was no higher than 17.8 million barrels a day, a mere 7% above the 16.6-million-barrel ceiling that the organization had established for the second half of this year.    But various industry estimates place the excess production at as much as three million barrels a day, or about 18%, higher than the official limit.    Blame for some of the excess OPEC production falls on Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and other Arab nations that support Iraq in its war against Iran; by producing heavily and driving down oil prices, these countries may be seeking to reduce Iranian oil revenue. But whatever OPEC's output level -- or reasons for it -- Middle East producers have found a ready market for their excess production.    Indeed, demand for OPEC oil climbed sharply from the beginning of summer. As concern mounted over a possible interruption of Persian Gulf supplies, oil traders bid spot and futures prices far above the official OPEC base price of $18 a barrel.    At one point, after tensions had flared anew in July, the &quot;spread&quot; between OPEC's fixed prices and world-wide market prices widened to more than $4 a barrel, enabling traders to make a hefty profit by grabbing OPEC oil and reselling it.    New flare-ups in the Persian Gulf could, of course, send spot and futures prices surging again. But in recent weeks, these prices have declined much closer to OPEC price levels, reducing traders' incentive to buy OPEC oil. And more significantly, signs are growing that the need for OPEC oil is softening. Moreover, the call on OPEC oil will fall further if spot and futures prices decline in the wake of this week's meetings of the OPEC committees, as forecast by Mr. Hamm and others.    That means that the exporters who are producing beyond their quotas may have to slash production immediately, unless they return to last year's price discounting in order to preserve their expanded market shares.    If OPEC has indeed been producing as much as some think -- as much as 20 million barrels a day -- the cutbacks will have to be substantial. Planners at one major oil company estimate that demand for OPEC oil, after reaching 19 million barrels a day in the third quarter, will decline to 17.8 million in the fourth quarter.    Generally, however, oil economists project the call for OPEC oil at around 18 million barrels a day for the remainder of this year -- a figure that gives most OPEC members credit for staying near their quotas but takes account of greatly excessive production by Iraq, which refuses even to pretend that it is abiding by a production quota.    But one OPEC source acknowledges that demand could total even less than oil companies generally forecast. &quot;It would be right,&quot; he says, &quot;if we hadn't had the inventory buildup.&quot;    There's little doubt that a large amount of OPEC's surplus production this summer went straight into inventory restocking by refiners, who had drawn down their stocks earlier this year. These stored supplies are likely to present a further drag on the cartel's production later this year, many OPEC insiders fear. But just how much oil is available in stockpiles is another of the perplexing questions facing OPEC.    The consensus among those who track oil movements holds that world oil inventories are comparable with those of a year ago. But the volume of oil going into storage is expected to rise sharply for several weeks regardless of whether OPEC production declines.    In August, government and commercial stores of oil onshore grew at a rate of one million barrels a day, one industry expert said. Moreover, the expert suggested that an additional 1.5 million barrels of the excess oil produced in OPEC every day during August remains at sea, and will only reach shore this month or next.    &quot;Either there is a lot of oil on slow-moving tankers,&quot; said PaineWebber's Mr. Jacoboski, &quot;or there's a hole in the ocean.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
