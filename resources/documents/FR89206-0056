BPA has prepared an environmental assessment(DOE/EA-0355) evaluating the proposed project. Reasons that replacing the115-kV line with a 230-kV double-circuit line would not cause significantenvironmental impact include: (1) Only limited, mostly short-term impactson land use, soils, vegetation, and wildlife (including no impact on endangeredspecies); (2) no effect on air and water resources; (3) visual impactson the landscape are already established by the existing transmission linesin the corridor; and (4) substantive consistency with State and local landuse plans.A finding is included that there is no practicable alternative to locatingthe project within a 100-year floodplain.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Anthony R.

Box 3621-AJ, Portland, Oregon 97208; telephone (503) 230-5136.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> Load growth in the west-central areaof Snohomish County, Washington, together with the limited capacity ofthe existing transmission system in the area, has created potential overloadconditions on BPA and Snohomish County PUD facilities. BPA needs to ensurethat its service to Snohomish County PUD continues to be reliable. To dothis, BPA proposes to replace a 115-kV transmission line between SnohomishSubstation and Beverly Park Substation with a double-circuit 230-kV transmissionline, with Snohomish County PUD upgrading its Beverly Park-Paine Field55-kV line to 115-kV. From Snohomish Substation to Beverly Park Substation,the line that would be replaced is within a corridor containing three toeight other transmission lines.Effects on land use would be mostly short-term. A wider right-of-way wouldbe needed, but is not expected to displace existing land uses except forone house along Snohomish County PUD's part of the project. Snohomish CountyPUD has purchased the house, which is not of historical significance, andplans to remove it. Other effects on land use would be temporary, suchas damage to crops and pasture vegetation. These impacts are not significantbecause they are short-term and not extensive, or limited to the one house.Effects on vegetation would also be mostly short-term, because only limitedtree clearing would be needed. Low-growing vegetation damaged by constructionactivity would quickly recover, and BPA would ensure that new infestationsof noxious weeds do not occur.The project would cross the Snohomish River, a navigable water. BPA wouldobtain the appropriate permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers beforeconstruction. No other effects on water resources, including wetlands,are expected.Terrestrial wildlife would be displaced during construction activity, buttheir populations are expected to become reestablished naturally alongwith the ground vegetation. The new line would present an obstacle forbirds, as do the other lines in the corridor. However, the number of additionalbird collisions is not expected to increase significantly. Because theproject would not affect water, neither would it affect fish.Construction may cause soil rutting, compaction, or erosion, but theseimpacts would be limited to construction sites and would be repaired asnecessary. Construction may also create dust, but this would be temporaryand not extensive. Cleared vegetation would not be burned, so no smokewould be created.Because the proposed new transmission line would replace an existing line,it would have little effect on public health and safety. Magnetic fieldstrength at the right-of-way edge may decrease slightly, and electric fieldstrength may increase slightly, so the potential for health effects thatmay be cause by electric/magnetic fields would remain substantially unchanged.The landscape that would be crossed by the new transmission line is typicalof the surrounding area and contains no unique features. The existing multi-linecorridor has already established visual impacts on the landscape, and theincremental change in transmission line structure size, design, and appearancewould not have a significantly greater impact.No important cultural resources are known to exist in the area of potentialimpact, but it is possible that undiscovered sites exist. If such siteswere discovered during the pre-construction cultural resource survey orduring construction, strict procedures would be followed to ensure thatdamage to important resources are avoided. Therefore, no effects on culturalresources are expected.The project is consistent with all pertinent State and local land use plansand programs. The Washington Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council reviewedthe project against pertinent State siting standards for such facilities,and found it consistent with those standards. The project would providegreater than the minimum vertical clearance required by the State at highwaycrossings, and structures would be located well away from highways, toaccommodate potential highway widening. Also, transmission lines are apermitted use in all Snohomish County land use zones.Located within Washington's coastal zone, the project is consistent withthe substantive provisions of the State's coastal zone management program.The Washington Department of Ecology has commented that, to be consistentwith the Washington Shoreline Management Act (through which the coastalzone program is administered), certain local shoreline development permitsare required. Snohomish County has also commented that the project requiresCounty permits, i.e., a Flood Hazard Permit and a Shoreline ManagementPermit. The U.S. Department of Energy and BPA do not agree that these permitprocesses are pertinent to this Federal project, because the processesare not authorized by the Coastal Zone Management Act or any other applicableFederal law. The controversy is about procedural issues only, and doesnot affect the significance of environmental impacts.The project is also consistent with Federal policy for farmland protectionand with all regulations for pollution control at Federal facilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Floodplain Statement of Findings</ITAG>The transmission line would unavoidably cross the Snohomish River 100-yearfloodplain for a distance of about 1.8 mile, within an established utilitycorridor. The proposed action (with a location map), the impact on thefloodplain, an explanation of why the action is being proposed in the floodplain,and steps taken to minimize environmental impacts to the affected floodplainare discussed in the EA. The proposal would have negligible adverse impacton the natural vegetation and would not affect the flow of the river. Adoptedmitigation measures, as described in the EA, will ensure that no significantimpact will occur to the floodplain and that the action will conform toapplicable state and local floodplain protection standards. DOE finds thatthere is no practicable alternative to locating the project within thefloodplain, consistent with the policy set forth in Executive Order 11988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Availability</ITAG>This Finding will be distributed to all persons and agencies known to beinterested in or affected by the proposed action or alternatives.<ITAG tagnum="84">Determination</ITAG>The Snohomish County Support Transmission Project is not an action normallyrequiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement, is notsimilar to any such action, and is not without precedent. Based on theinformation in the EA, as summarized here, the Department of Energy determinesthat BPA's actions will not significantly affect the quality of the humanenvironment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act,42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3> Therefore, an environmental impact statement will notbe prepared.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, December 27, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ernest C.
