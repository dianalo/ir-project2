Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh was accompanied by navyCommander-in-Chief Adm. Prapas Krisnachan for the visit during whichThailand and China are expected to sign a major arms deal involvingsales of 30 Chinese-built tanks, 800 armored personnel carriers andspare parts, the sources said.   Also up for discussion is the possibility of setting up a warreserve stockpile from which Thailand could draw Chinese-suppliedweaponry in event of a threat to its national security. A similararrangement has been set up with the United States.   The Thai military has said arms purchases from China arenecessary to bolster Thailand's defense capabilities againstVietnamese troops across the Thai-Cambodian border. The Vietnamese,who invaded Cambodia in late 1978, are regarded as Thailand's mainexternal security threat.   Although Thailand buys most of its weaponry from the UnitedStates, it has recently obtained tanks, armored personnel carriersand anti-aircraft guns from Beijing.   In July, the navy bought four Chinese-made frigates and isconsidering buying small submarines for operations in the shallowGulf of Thailand, the Thai newspaper The Nation reported Sunday.   A commentary in Vietnam's official Communist Party newspaper NhanDan on Nov. 20 attacked military cooperation between China andThailand and the support of the two countries for Cambodianresistance groups fighting the Vietnamese in Cambodia.   China is the main supplier of weapons to the three-partyresistance forces that include the communist Khmer Rouge.   Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Saroj Chavanaviraj called thestatements ``interference'' in Thailand's affairs, adding: ``To buy(Chinese weapons) or not is a Thai military decision.''</TEXT></DOC>
