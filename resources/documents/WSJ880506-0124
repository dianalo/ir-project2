Illegal aliens rushing to apply for amnesty before a Wednesday midnight deadline were full of such hopes. But the flip side of the 18-month-old federal immigration act is less appealing.    Some applicants will be refused. That risk meant that only about half those thought to be eligible applied. A page-one article in this newspaper Wednesday by Alfredo Corchado described how the Immigration and Naturalization Service in El Paso goes about seeking out illegals:   &quot;Locally, the agency deploys 16 undercover agents, some of whom make rounds in open-necked guayaberas and sunglasses. They check on about 8,300 state-registered employers, plus many more unregistered ones, mainly mom and pop stores. So far, the guayabera squad has warned 100 employers and fined eight, all of whom employ fewer than 30 people.&quot;    Senator Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) never could understand why we opposed his immigration bill. In this column on Dec. 30, 1985, we explained that it is &quot;odious and embarrassing&quot; to levy criminal penalties on employers caught between laws that forbid discrimination and an immigration act that punishes any lack of sufficient wariness about brown skins and Hispanic names.    The guayabera squads confirm our worst fears. When the amnesty is behind us, all that remains will be a law bringing the full weight of the U.S. government down on people whose only crime is a wish for a better future. Each time a guayabera cop swoops down on a mom and pop store, the golden door will become a bit more like the doors to less-admired countries. </TEXT></DOC>
