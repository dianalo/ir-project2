Take James Bernardin's word for it.    Armed with a high-powered .30-.30 rifle, the 220-pound Vermonter is squeezed between limbs of an oak tree growing in a misty marsh on the edge of Lake Champlain. His rifle cocked and his gaze fixed on the murky water 12 feet below, he gingerly leans against a branch.    Ten minutes pass, then 15, then 20. The water is calm. Suddenly, a ripple disrupts the glassy surface. Boom! Mr. Bernardin fires. He has the look of anticipation of a kid opening a cookie jar.    But it's a miss, and there's a flurry of invective. &quot;Damn fish, bleeping slipped away again,&quot; Mr. Bernardin swears.    This is a story about fish, but it isn't a fish story, and it isn't about fishing in the usual sense.    Fish hunting season has arrived in Vermont. From March 25 to May 25, the spawning season, it's legal to shoot certain fish in this lake (up to a limit of 10 daily). Rifles work best, aficionados say. But shotguns and pistols are used, too. Sportsmen stop short at Uzi submachine guns.    Many people, of course, don't think blasting away at fish with a gun of any sort is particularly sporting. In 1975, New York banned fish-shooting on its side of the 125-mile-long lake. No state but Vermont now permits catching fish with guns.    Trigger-happy hunters could wipe out large fish populations, argues Jon Anderson, a Vermont state biologist. At times, he says, shots ring out like firecrackers along the shore, and he will find 40 or 50 dead fish floating in the lake. &quot;I don't understand,&quot; Mr. Anderson adds. &quot;We say wildlife is sacred. But we can shoot fish.&quot;    Vermont's first law on the subject, passed in 1933, has come under fire a number of times. But proponents of shooting fish so far have prevailed. The practice is &quot;as dear as motherhood&quot; to many Vermonters, says state Rep. Jane Potvin, who does her fishing with rod and reel.    Anti-hunting forces did manage to get the law revoked in 1969. But a year later, an even more permissive law restored legal fish-shooting. Now, hunters can shoot not just northern pike and pickerel (the permitted fish under the old law), but carp, gar, shad, bowfin, bullhead, mullet, suckers and other so-called cull fish that anglers often aren't interested in. They aren't &quot;endangered,&quot; in the sense environmentalists use the word.    The brass-bullet-and-hip-boots bunch waxes eloquent about the joys of their sport. &quot;Spring moved {Vermonter} Robert Frost to poetry,&quot; observes Mr. Bernardin. The season &quot;moves hundreds of Vermonters to jump into waterproof overalls, sling a loaded rifle over their shoulder and climb into a tree.&quot; Adjusting his own position in the oak, the Burlington agricultural engineer adds, &quot;This isn't just fun. This is ritual.&quot;    Some lakeside residents say the sound of gunfire on the water is but another sign of spring. Often it is heard before the honking of geese returning north, before the crackle of thawing ice, before the loon's song. &quot;It's music to my ears,&quot; says Virginia McClean, a Burlington retiree, altogether seriously.    Rochelle Gardner, 29, says she has had fish-shooting fever ever since she first tried it eight years ago with her father, John. She says they now regularly go out &quot;as a family,&quot; armed and wearing polarized sunglasses to cut down the glare on the surface of the water and make it easier to see the fish.    Even then, hunters say, it isn't easy. The season is short and part of the game is guessing when various species come in to spawn. Generally around the end of March, fish make their way to the marshes, often swimming under ice in the lake. Hunters say the males arrive four days before the females. Once the females arrive, spawning is accomplished within a couple of days and they depart. Different species arrive at different times. First come the pike, then the pickerel; mullets and suckers are usually the last. Hunters wait in the trees.    They climb 12 to 15 feet, usually stepping on wood slats nailed to trunks by their considerate predecessors. Trying not to cast a shadow on the water, they watch for ripples.    When they see something and pull the trigger, hunters actually try not to hit a fish directly. A bull's-eye shot with a .30-.30 bullet makes mincemeat of fish flesh.    So the trick is to miss by an inch or two. The impact of the nearby blast does the job. As compressed water rushes through its gills, a fish is knocked unconscious. The hunter must scramble down from his perch and net his catch while the fish is still stunned.    Though the hunter is at some advantage in this, many hunters go home empty-handed. The Gardners haven't had a good season this year: two trips, no fish. But, if lucky, a shooter with one blast can knock out the female and a half-dozen males tagging along.    Because hunters aim at ripples, they do at times shoot the wrong fish. It's against the law to shoot trout, for example, but a trout ripple looks pretty much like a carp ripple. &quot;It's a law that's really hard to enforce,&quot; says Robert McKnight, a fish and game warden, who says no one has been arrested for violating it in more than 20 years.    But to hear fish shooters tell it, the sport can be hazardous -- and not just for the fish. Hunters occasionally fall out of trees. Bullets have been known to ricochet off the water, putting holes in the windows and walls of lakeside homes. So far, no one has been seriously injured.    Many fish shooters don't eat what they catch. The fish they are allowed to kill aren't popular at many sportsmen's dinner tables. Richard Hazen, a 63-year-old South Hero islander and longtime fish hunter, says he bagged six northern pike with about 10 shots one afternoon recently. &quot;I ate one,&quot; he says. &quot;It tasted terrible. I took a couple to a cat I know that lives in a barn; it's great cat food, I hear. I gave a couple to a neighbor, and the rest to a squirrel I'm trying to befriend.&quot;    Criticism notwithstanding, fish-hunting defenders say they won't give up the sport. John Roy, a robust South Hero selectman, says he made the 40-mile trip from his farm to the state capitol in Montpelier to present his &quot;simple defense,&quot; which is this: &quot;My father did it, so why can't I?&quot; To Mr. Roy, 49, who was born just down the road from his 300-acre farm, to ban the sport would be to take away something very basic: &quot;Others grew up on TV; we didn't have money to buy a TV set; so I fished in the creek. It's in my blood.&quot;    Still, he concedes, fish-shooting is likely to fade away. It isn't very popular with younger people in Vermont anymore. &quot;You don't have to kill it,&quot; he says of the sport. &quot;It will die a natural death.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
