JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Information on what hazardous chemicals arebeing released from nearby industrial plants will soon be as closeas the home computer or a neighborhood library, says theEnvironmental Protection Agency.   The EPA unveiled its computerized database for toxic chemicalreleases on Monday and said that in the coming months theinformation _ which will be updated yearly _ will be available inmicrofiche as well as computer disc and magnetic tape.   The inventory of releases, which is based on information providedthe EPA by each company, also may be obtained through ToxNet, acomputer information system of the National Library of Medicine.Access to ToxNet will cost $25 an hour and be accessible by homecomputers 24 hours a day.   A 1986 law, which took effect last year, requires industry tosupply information each year on what toxic chemicals are beingreleased from plants. The requirement covers 328 hazardous chemicals.   It took the EPA nearly a year to develop the computer database,but Charles Elkins, director of toxics at the agency, said the jobis likely to be easier and quicker next time around. Industry isscheduled to submit its second round of data at the end of thismonth, covering releases in 1988.   The first set of data was submitted nearly a year ago, reflectingreleases in 1987.   ``We have tried to make the computerized inventory as `userfriendly' as possible,'' said EPA Administrator William K. Reilly.   The EPA database allows a person to focus on a single industrialplant and learn what toxic releases into the air, water, or soil theplant has reported to the EPA during the latest reporting year.   The system includes a variety of indexes including type ofchemicals, names of plants, and locations of plants down tocounties, cities and postal zip codes, officials said.   The EPA said the computerized database or microfiche will be madeavailable to more than 1,400 federal libraries and local publiclibary systems so that at least one library in every county willhave the data available.   In addition, the database on computer disc or magnetic tape willbe for sale through the Government Printing Office or the NationalTechnical Information System (NTIS).</TEXT><TEXT>   Editors: For more information about the toxic chemical releaseinventory contact the Environmental Protection Agency, (phone:800-535-0202); National Technical Information Systems (phone:703-487-4650); National Library of Medicine (phone: 301-496-6531);the U.S Government Printing Office, (phone: 202-275-2091)</TEXT></DOC>
