 Users who scoffed at graphical user interfaces are rushing toconvert their applications.andP;  Software vendors are getting whiplash injuriesin their haste to reverse course as they cast OS/2 development aside andsteer toward Windows.andP;  In Silicon Valley, about the only way you can get aWindows programmer is to marry one.andP;  Even though the crucial desktoppublishing market is about evenly split between GEM-based Ventura Publisherand Windows-based PageMaker, there's little hope for competition amonggraphical interfaces.andP;  Now that Xerox has ported Ventura to Windows, the showis over.andP;  All the interesting ancillary applications are Windows-basedanyway.andM;Straight into the teeth of this competition-chilling wind sails tinyGeoWorks, purveyor of graphical operating environments for Commodore andAtari machines.andP;  With its graphical environment operating system for DOS(GEOS), the GUI category is suddenly a two-boat race.andP;  Not that GeoWorkswants to race at all, preferring to go about its business without raisingMicrosoft's interest.andP;  Microsoft's might and marketing clout are likely toblow GeoWorks flat--if the giant favors it with so much as a breath.andM;Granted, the differences between GEOS and Windows are enormous.andP;  GEOS makesno pretense of multitasking DOS applications (although it can launch them).andO;Nor does it have the huge number of applications that have popped up forWindows.andP;  And it doesn't take a multi-megabyte machine to make it work.andP;  GEOSthrives in a 640K 286, and even performs respectably on an 8088.andP;  On arun-of-the-mill 386, GEOS performs crisply in a way that Windows only dreamsof.andP;  It also looks better.andP;  GEOS's default interface is OSF's Motif, and Ifind it much more handsome than Win 3.andP;  It's also a chameleon, giving you thechoice of a Windows 2 look, if you so desire.andM;Now why would Microsoft care about an upstart company that has publiclystated that it doesn't want to compete?andP;  Because it makes Microsoft look bad.andO;Through all the years of effort on Windows, all we've heard is how difficultit is to build a windowing environment for the PC.andP;  Also, Microsoft swore upand down to the corporate community that Win 3 would run well on the 286machines' 1MB installed base.andP;  Well, it runs, but that's about all you cansay for it.andP;  Windows doesn't really come to life until it's on a 386, andtherein lies the huge market opportunity for GEOS.andP;  There's a huge installedbase of machines out there that no one will upgrade or trade in any timesoon.andM;IF IT WERE EASY...andM;The key to GEOS's performance and small size is that it's written in assemblylanguage.andP;  The upshot is that it's several times smaller than Windows.andP;  Itsapplications are also a fraction of the size of equivalent applications inWindows.andP;  Sold for $195 retail as GeoWorks Ensemble, it includes a wordprocessor, paint program, two telecommunications packages, and a personalinformation manager.andP;  It saves space because the GEOS kernel provides asophisticated array of services to each application, freeing the programmerfrom many space- and time-consuming tasks.andP;  The kernel itself is only 55K,including a PostScript-like font manager that provides a consistent fontdisplay and printing model for the screen and output devices.andP;  This, you'llrecall, is the hot issue that is still being debated in OS/2 circles.andP;  It'snot an issue for Ensemble applications.andP;  If you want to print 24-point CooperBlack at a 15-degree angle, it'll look the same on your screen as it does onyour printer.andP;  What's more, the font manager is available to everyapplication that wants to use it.andM;GEOS also gets a boost from being object-oriented internally.andP;  Designing agraphical operating system around objects and classes not only keeps thingslean and mean, but gives applications programmers a rich collection ofservices to draw upon, which keeps the applications small.andP;  Win 3 definitelylooks bad by comparison.andM;Now comes the geo-politics, if you will.andP;  IBM and GeoWorks were working on aconcept last year called PM Lite.andP;  The idea was to largely duplicate thePresentation Manager user interface and application program interface, butover DOS, not OS/2.andP;  The intention was to offer what Microsoft had beenunable to deliver: a smooth transition from DOS to OS/2 for graphicalprograms.andP;  Microsoft severely strained its relationship with IBM in theensuing struggle to have PM Lite shelved because of the threat to the hugeinvestment in Windows.andP;  GeoWorks, however, continued development.andP;  Nowthere's a choice in graphical operating environments, and some large players,including Lotus, have indicated that they're interested in developingsoftware for GEOS.andM;And what if GEOS is a success?andP;  Is IBM preempted from offering it?andP;  Notcompletely.andP;  The PS/1 contains a runtime version of GEOS with a custominterface that gets you into your major applications and the Promenadeon-line support network.andP;  GEOS's graphical implementation is the mostsophisticated, user-friendly communications program yet offered for DOS,because the user and host machines work together cooperatively to offerintelligent menu choices and terrific ease of use.andM;Meanwhile, a number of retail-oriented manufacturers are bundling GeoWorksEnsemble with their machines.andP;  It's ironic that the PC buyers who shop forcomputers at K mart will go home with a superior user interface, richscalable fonts, and all the other Maclike things we've been waiting for solong.andP;  With a little luck, they may never see the C:\andgt; prompt.andM;Almost everything good in this industry has come from the bottom up, not thetop down.andP;  GEOS is certainly a bottom-up approach to the market, but withserious implications for those in the middle and the top.andP;  As a user and abrand specifier, you owe it to yourself to understand GEOS and the choices itoffers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
