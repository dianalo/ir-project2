<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-60-0440 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new vacuum-oven sublimation method (PVOS) for measuring the hydrocarbonfraction of diesel particulates has been developed to overcome problemswith the standard vacuum-oven sublimation technique (VOS). VOS gave extremelylow (negative at 15:1 A/F) results for diesel particulate samples takenat medium to high load (25:1 or lower A/F). The low results are due tothe adsorption by the samples of trace amounts of continuously regenerated(from test samples and oven seals) heavy-hydrocarbon oven contaminants.PVOS corrects the problem by using a nitrogen gas purge to seep hydrocarbonsfrom the oven during testing. Comparisons among PVOS, VOS and methylenechloride extraction (MCE) over a range of A/F and engine speeds showedthat PVOS results correlate more closely with MCE results than do resultsdetermined by the standard VOS technique.</TEXT></DOC>
