(Fiber Distributed Data Interface)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Puttre, Michael.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Management information systems managers who would like to connectfiber optic networks with non-fiber optic networks forinteroperability can use two methods: encapsulation andtranslation.andP;  With encapsulation, a bridge takes a whole packetfrom an Ethernet network, for instance, and builds an FDDI packetaround it.andP;  Encapsulation is quick and easy, and most FDDI bridgesuse data encapsulation.andP;  The translating bridge breaks down thedata from a non-fiber network and builds a 'native' FDDI packet,using less or saving more bandwidth on either side.andO;High-performance translation bridges are difficult to build, andthe speed of data passing through has suffered.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fiber Distributed Data Interface StandardFiber OpticsNetworksConnectivityBridges (Connector)MIS.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
