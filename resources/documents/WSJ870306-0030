Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), at his first hearing as chairman of the finance subcommittee, said Congress has waited long enough for the marketplace's &quot;self-corrective tendencies&quot; to curb Wall Street's excesses. Congress, he said, should &quot;restore some modicum of control.&quot;    The Williams Act, which governs the tender-offer process, is &quot;ripe for reform,&quot; Mr. Markey asserted. &quot;This is clearly the year to act, rather than to study.&quot;    Republican leaders, however, seemed less inclined to pass takeover legislation. Instead, they are pushing a bill that would set up a commission to study insider trading and other stock-market problems and offer legislative recommendations next year.    At the same time, Rep. Matthew Rinaldo (R., N.J.), ranking minority member on the subcommittee, showed strong interest in developing a statutory definition of insider trading. He suggested that the Securities and Exchange Commission draft a definition for lawmakers before the Supreme Court rules on the insider-trading convictions of former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans and two other men.    The case is a major test of the SEC's &quot;misappropriation&quot; theory, which holds that it is illegal to trade on misappropriated, or stolen, inside information. Under the theory, the agency has extended its enforcement reach well beyond corporate insiders and their outside advisers.    Under questioning by lawmakers yesterday, SEC Chairman John Shad conceded that his agency could be in trouble if the Supreme Court threw out the misappropriation theory. But he said he doesn't expect that to happen.    As for defining insider trading, Mr. Shad said the courts have been doing a &quot;pretty good job,&quot; and suggested waiting for the Supreme Court ruling. If necessary, he told lawmakers, the SEC would propose a statutory definition.    Sounded out on takeover issues, Mr. Shad said he favors shortening the 10-day period in which investors must report stock holdings of 5% or more to the SEC. But he rejected restricting the use of high-yield, high-risk &quot;junk bonds,&quot; and doubling the current tender-offer period of 20 business days.    At the hearing, several lawmakers expressed concern about the porousness of &quot;Chinese walls&quot; dividing securities firms' risk-arbitrage and mergers-and-acquisitions departments. But Mr. Shad cautioned them against barring both activities under the same roof.    Such a prohibition would put the nation's multiservice securities firms at a severe competitive disadvantage overseas, he said.    But Rep. Markey and other lawmakers said that Wall Street's system of self-regulation has clearly failed. &quot;We in Congress must act to restore investor confidence,&quot; said Rep. Mickey Leland (D., Texas). </TEXT></DOC>
