(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two of the nation's leading manufacturers of heavy equipment head into contract talks this week, hoping to maintain the momentum of their recent recovery in the face of rising labor demands.    Caterpillar Inc. and Deere andamp; Co., two Illinois-based giants with more than 30,000 union workers in seven states, will bargain with the United Auto Workers to replace contracts expiring at midnight Sept. 30.    Negotiations with Deere, the giant of farm tractor and agricultural implement manufacturing, begin tomorrow at the company's Moline, Ill. headquarters.    The following day, talks begin with Peoria-based Caterpillar, the world's leading maker of earth-moving equipment, at a hotel in the St. Louis area.    At Caterpillar, the mood is one of cautious optimism. The company has slugged its way out of the economic doldrums, piling up $624 million in earnings from 1985 to 1987 after absorbing unprecedented losses of $953 million from 1982 to 1984. Earnings for the first six months of this year stood at $263 million on sales of $4.9 billion.    But Caterpillar officials note the more recent profits are less than half the $1.6 billion that the company earned from 1979 to 1981 before the collapse.    &quot;If you think happy days are here again, you're wrong,&quot; said a Caterpillar spokesman. &quot;We aren't back where we used to be.&quot;    The Caterpillar talks affect 17,553 union workers at 12 cities in Illinois, Iowa, Colorado, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. Caterpillar employs nearly 59,000 people world-wide.    Union workers are looking for a slice of Caterpillar's growing profit pie, and say they deserve to be rewarded for helping the company reclaim its strong grip on the market from competitors such as Japan's Komatsu Ltd.    Tony Green, president of the UAW's Peoria Local 974, which represents more than 10,000 active Caterpillar workers and 1,000 on layoff, thinks workers deserve a merit raise.    &quot;Caterpillar is on the rebound,&quot; Mr. Green said. &quot;Things have turned around and they need to reward the people who are responsible for the profits -- the people in the shops.&quot;    Mr. Green wants to see a boost in the average blue-collar wages of $14.61 an hour, or $30,388 annually for a 40-hour week. With fringe benefits, Caterpillar calculates its current labor costs at $26 an hour for each employee.    Mr. Green also wants expansion of worker training programs and job-security agreements that were among the few gains the union claimed in the last two contracts.    Those agreements resulted in wage freezes and cuts in bonuses. The 1986 talks were extended four times before a settlement was reached. The 1982 negotiations broke down and a record seven-month strike ensued as Caterpillar tried to convince the union it faced trouble after posting its best year ever in 1981 with profits of $579 million.    The next three years were stained with red ink. Caterpillar closed nine plants and slashed its work force 40%, from nearly 88,000 to 53,600, in an effort to survive soaring interest rates, a strong U.S. dollar and fierce foreign competition in a stagnant marketplace.    &quot;Nobody believed Cat was in dire straits,&quot; Mr. Green said. &quot;We were too content. Everyone suffered in the strike. We went through hell. We're not a bunch of strike-happy nuts because no one really wins. But we will strike if we have to.&quot;    Deere still is trying to rebound from a five-month strike in 1986-87, the longest in the company's 151-year history. Already suffering from the prolonged farm recession, Deere's earnings collapsed when socked by the strike.    The 163-day work stoppage at 13 Deere plants in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Georgia, Tennessee and Colorado ended Feb. 1, 1987, when union workers accepted a wage freeze, a one-time payment of $735 each and creation of a job-protection plan.    Deere earnings for the first half of fiscal 1988, which ended April 30, were $154 million on sales of $2.5 billion.    Analysts disagree on the effects of the 1988 drought on Deere sales and earnings, but the issue is expected to come up during the contract talks.    As with Caterpillar, the Deere talks also will focus on merit increases and job security. Both sides decline to talk in detail, but say they are confident they can achieve a settlement without a strike.    &quot;We expect to reach an agreement that satisfies the requirements of Deere and its UAW-represented employees,&quot; said G. Bart Bontems, director of industrial relations for the company.    Adds UAW international representative Jim Hecker: &quot;United Auto Workers shares the belief with Deere andamp; Co. that the discussions. . . will be productive.&quot;    The average factory worker at Deere earns $15.47 an hour and the company calculates its labor costs at $26.90 an hour, including vacation, bonuses, holidays and other fringe benefits.    The current talks will affect about 13,400 active employees, and 4,000 laid-off workers, at 11 cities in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Colorado and Georgia. Deere employs about 38,000 employees world-wide. </TEXT></DOC>
