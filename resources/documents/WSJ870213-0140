The development followed a meeting last Saturday between Tan Sri Khoo's financial adviser, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., and Brunei Finance Ministry officials. The parties met to discuss settlement of the scandal-ridden bank's large debts to creditors and depositors and more than $467.3 million, at current exchange rates, in loans that Khoo-related companies owe the bank.    The meeting was the first between Brunei officials and Tan Sri Khoo's advisers since the Brunei government seized National Bank and closed it Nov. 20. On that day, Brunei also arrested Tan Sri Khoo's son and chairman of the bank, Khoo Ban Hock, as well as four other bank officials and auditors.    The government has charged all five with criminal breach of trust, conspiracy to cheat companies or persons who might lend to or deposit funds with National Bank, and making false statements in annual reports of the bank. The bank officers and auditors have yet to enter a plea in the criminal proceedings.    Brunei government investigations have disclosed that 90% of National Bank's lending was to Khoo-related concerns. The government has demanded that the Khoo family, which owned more than 70% of the bank before it was seized, repay the debts outstanding. National Bank itself owes $186.9 million to $233.6 million to a group of more than 30 international banks, $70.1 million to the Brunei government and lesser amounts to others.    Yesterday, Tan Sri Khoo, through Shearson, issued a statement saying the proposal &quot;provides for the repayment in full of all financial obligations of National Bank&quot; while &quot;protecting the position of the shareholders and creditors of the Khoo group of companies.&quot;    The statement, which didn't describe the proposal, added that Shearson had called a meeting of all National Bank's creditors for next Friday in Singapore. The statement acknowledged that the Brunei government hasn't &quot;accepted&quot; the plan. But it added that &quot;a number of banks who are the largest lenders to National Bank have indicated that they would welcome any constructive alternative to costly and protracted litigation&quot; to recover their loans.    The bank's biggest creditors are Britain's Standard Chartered PLC and American Express Banking Corp., which are owed $37.4 million and $32.7 million, respectively.    Despite the tacit optimism of the Shearson statement, Brunei officials this week sharply criticized the Khoo-Shearson offer, which makes no provision for quick repayment to bank creditors, entails more borrowing from undisclosed sources and calls for new guarantees from Tan Sri Khoo to creditors.    A Brunei finance official said yesterday that &quot;the only settlement which is considered acceptable to the Ministry of Finance is one which will remove the claims of all existing creditors and that would include (the) government as well as the creditor banks.    As described by bankers and Brunei officials familiar with it, the Khoo-Shearson plan involves several steps.    First, Shearson proposes that 70-year-old Tan Sri Khoo assume liability to persons and institutions with claims against National Bank. A Shearson-managed escrow arrangement would be established and assets held by Tan Sri Khoo and National Bank would be placed in it as they became available. The escrow arrangement, which would take the form of a new company, would be used to generate funds for eventual repayment of Tan Sri Khoo's obligations.    The new company would oversee the restructuring and rescheduling of National Bank's interbank borrowings from international banks.    Shearson then proposes to arrange new borrowings, apparently using the assets in escrow as security, to repay National Bank's obligations to the Brunei government, which advanced about $69.9 million to repay Brunei depositors when the bank was closed.    To cover obligations to National Bank's creditor banks, the Shearson plan calls for Tan Sri Khoo to arrange for one or more of his companies to become the &quot;obligator&quot; to them, in effect guaranteeing repayment of the credits outstanding.    Finally, the Shearson proposal asks that the Brunei government immediately freeze all civil legal proceedings against Tan Sri Khoo and Khoo-related companies in Hong Kong and elsewhere. Shearson says it will be &quot;almost impossible&quot; to implement its proposed settlement if Brunei continues to press legal claims against its client.    Brunei has filed civil suits against Khoo-related companies in Brunei, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia for the recovery of about $441.6 million they borrowed from National Bank and against 14 Singapore-based, Khoo-controlled concerns that guaranteed the loans.    In its statement yesterday, Shearson described its proposal as &quot;the most commercially realistic method available to achieve the repayment in full of all amounts owed by National Bank.&quot;    Brunei officials took a sharply different view. The Finance Ministry objected to the plan, saying it was designed to &quot;repay the (Brunei) government and Khoo-related listed companies, and not provide for repayment to the creditor banks.&quot; The ministry said Shearson's proposal that additional funds be borrowed to repay National Bank deposits held by Khoo-related companies in Singapore &quot;illustrates the attempts by Khoo first to compensate himself at the expense of creditor financial institutions.&quot;    Brunei officials note that Brunei holds sizable securities pledged by the Khoo family to National Bank that could be liquidated, as well as other assets, and they leave open the possibility of more suits against Tan Sri Khoo or companies related to him. </TEXT></DOC>
