Thirteen months after the merger of InterFirst Corp. andRepublicBank Corp., the FDIC took over FirstRepublic in what may bethe largest federal bank rescue ever.   The FDIC is advancing $4 billion to help NCNB Corp. ofCharlotte, N.C., acquire the bank. The North Carolina company hasagreed to pay $210 million to $240 million to acquire a 20 percentstake in NCNB Texas National Bank. For five years it will have anoption to buy the remaining 80 percent from the FDIC.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman estimated the goverment mayrecoup some of the $4 billion to reduce the agency's cost to $2billion to $3 billion, which would still be more than the $1.7billion the FDIC does not expect to recover from its 1984 bailoutof Continental Illinois Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago.   At a hearing by the Senate Banking Committee, Seidman saidregulators knew the two Dallas banks were in trouble but could notforesee that conditions would change ``rapidly and adversely afterthe merger took place.''   While regulators knew both banks were in trouble, Seidman said,officials believed the new institution ``had a reasonable chance tosucceed.''   Although the merger was to result in an infusion of $200 millionin new capital and annual reductions of $100 million in operatingcosts, ``it was not enough to overcome these problems,'' he said.   Without the merger, the two banks ``clearly would have failed,''he said.   Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., saidauditing of the two banks before the merger was ``not sufficientlyadequate.''   The Comptroller of the Currency's office handles those audits,and spokeswoman Lee Cross said that although a formal examinationwas not done before the merger, the agency did a thorough review ofthe two banks' loan portfolios.   In a letter to the Federal Reserve, which had final approval ofthe merger, the comptroller's office wrote in April 1987:   ``Both InterFirst and Republic are seriously troubledinstitutions as confirmed by our recent on-site reviews. We believethat their future viability depends on some form of outsideassistance or other transaction such as the one proposed.   ``In developing our recommendation, we were mindful of the factthat certain unresolved accounting questions as well as lingeringdifficulties in the Texas economy may affect adversely some of theunderlying financial projections in the proposals, especiallyshort-term profitability.   ``Also, we are aware that the proposal is being viewed with somedegree of skepticism by market funding sources whose continuedsupport will be critical to the survival of the combinedinstituion. These matters unquestionably are clear threats to theultimate success of the proposal.''   Ms. Cross said the letter was ``not what you call a ringingendorsement'' of the merger proposal.   She said officials believed the real estate market in Texas wasabout to turn around at the time of the merger, but its failure toclimb out of recession hit the new bank hard.   Seidman said the FDIC had recommended the merger.   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said he understood that the Dallasbranch of the Federal Reserve had recommended against the merger as``imprudent'' but Seidman said he ``did not know that to be thecase.''   Seidman said the FDIC may have two more large bank failures onthe horizon, but would not identify the banks, their locations orwhen a collapse might occur.   When asked about the most pressing needs of the bankingindustry, Seidman said the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.needs prompt attention.   Seidman said it could cost about $50 billion to restore healthto the savings and loan industry, while the Federal Home Loan BankBoard, regulator of the nation's 3,100 savings and loans, puts theprice tag at $31 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
