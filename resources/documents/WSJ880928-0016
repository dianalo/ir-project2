Revenue for the year almost doubled to $10.1 million from $5.2 million. The company didn't break out fourth-quarter results, but for the first nine months of fiscal 1988, it had a net loss of $5.5 million on revenue of $7.3 million, compared with a net loss of $7.2 million on revenue of $2.8 million the year earlier.    Color Systems, Marina del Rey, Calif., which electronically converts black-and-white film to color videotape, said the write-downs are largely for color-conversion equipment that it says &quot;has limited production capability and must be enhanced&quot; with newer, faster systems the company is installing.    Color Systems lowered the value of its film library $4.1 million &quot;due to an overall decline in the domestic syndication marketplace.&quot; It said it expects to reach the operating cash flow break-even point by Jan. 1.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Color Systems closed at $3.125 a share, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
