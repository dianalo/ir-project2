But Boren seemed to excusethe lapses, saying, &quot;There are times that all of us who are busy can'tremember certain things.&quot;;   While saying he had made no final judgment aboutGates' fitness to direct the spy agency, Boren complimented the nominee'sintellect, his abilities as &quot;a creative thinker&quot; and his willingness to admitto past mistakes.;   Comments by others during Tuesday's session supportedthat conclusion.;   &quot;What has happened has happened,&quot; Sen. Dennis DeConcini,D-Ariz., told Gates. &quot;You admitted you made mistakes, and I admire that.&quot;Later, he added: &quot;I'm impressed with your candor.&quot;;   And Sen. John Chafee,R-R.I., commented, &quot;I'm confident you'll be confirmed.&quot;;   Allaying concernsof White House strategists over the possibility that the nomination will bedelayed, Boren said he would schedule a committee vote within a few days ofcompletion of the hearings, expected to come early next week. The hearings arein recess until Thursday.;   As he testified for a second day, Gatesacknowledged he had taken too pessimistic a view of the Soviet Union, his areaof expertise, and had missed the &quot;unthinkable&quot; changes that led to thecollapse of communism.;   &quot;We have all learned some important lessons . . . interms of thinking the unthinkable,&quot; said Gates, who is deputy nationalsecurity adviser to the president.;   He said it is important for the UnitedStates to &quot;do everything we can to strengthen the democratization process&quot; inthe new Soviet Union, including humanitarian aid this winter to head offpossible severe food shortages.;   Current intelligence capabilities there&quot;are very limited&quot; because the United States has diplomatic posts only inMoscow, Kiev and Leningrad, Gates said. &quot;We need to establish an officialpresence throughout these republics as soon as we can,&quot; he said.;   Gatesunderwent another day of quizzing about his role in the Iran-Contraarms-for-hostages scandal, at times repeating his regrets about not havingpursued the matter more aggressively after he learned of it.;   Boren askedGates about an Oct. 9, 1986, meeting he reportedly attended with then-CIAdirector William Casey and Alan Fiers, a former agency operative, to discussFiers' upcoming testimony before the intelligence committee.;   In sworntestimony, Fiers has told committee investigators that he was directed at themeeting to limit his testimony before the Senate panel.;   &quot;I don't recall themeeting,&quot; said Gates, who was Casey's deputy at the time.;   But he promisedthat no repeat of Iran-Contra would occur under his stewardship of the CIAbecause it will be made clear that &quot;that kind of thing will not betolerated.&quot;;   As the hearings moved forward, the nominee expressed severalpositions on intelligence issues that could draw fire within the CIA.;   Hesaid, for example, that he favors public disclosure of the amount thegovernment spends annually on its full range of intelligence activities. Thefigure, which sources have put at $30 billion this year, is classified andhidden away in the Pentagon's budget.;   And Gates voiced deep misgivingsabout future large-scale paramilitary covert operations such as proxy warsfought in Afghanistan, Angola and Nicaragua. &quot;I am not aware of one that hasstayed secret, and they have repeatedly embroiled the agency in controversyand difficulty,&quot; he said.;   In the future, Gates said, he would argue againstsuch operations unless there was &quot;fairly broad support&quot; among intelligenceprofessionals and in Congress for the action.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910918  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  11A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  680  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 18, 199100262123,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
