(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said today he has ``earnedconsideration'' as a vice presidential candidate if MassachusettsGov. Michael Dukakis should beat him for the Democraticpresidential nomination.   Jackson, while refusing to give up his own fight for the topspot on the ticket, said of front-runner Dukakis, ``If he wins,I've earned consideration.'' He said that if he wins the nominationhe will give Dukakis the same consideration.   The civil rights activist also was to give a speech on urbanpolicy today, one week before elections in New Jersey, California,New Mexico and Montana close out the Democratic primary season.   Jackson said in Trenton today that he and Dukakis must worktogether to defeat Vice President George Bush, the RepublicanParty's all-but-certain nominee.   ``Together, we must use our combined strength to change thecourse,'' Jackson said.   ``If I put forth a vision, then reward me,'' Jackson added.   Dukakis, who is expected to win enough delegates to sew up thenomination next Tuesday, said Sunday that Jackson would have amajor role at the Democratic National Convention and in the fallcampaign.   On Monday in New Jersey, Jackson, who upset Jews and others bycalling nearby new York ``Hymietown'' in his presidential bid fouryears ago, issued a Memorial Day call for blacks and Jews to unite.   Feelings were still high in the New York primary this spring,and Mayor Edward I. Koch said Jews would have to be crazy to votefor Jackson. But Jackson drew cheers in Englewood from a mixedcrowd of black and white supporters.   Citing the holiday and its commemoration of America's war dead,he told a story of black U.S. soldiers coming upon a Naziconcentration camp in World War II.   He offered the meeting between the GIs and Jewish survivors asan example of how blacks and Jews might unite now.   ``Cannot the sons and daughters of the victims of the Holocaustand the sons and daughters of slaves find common ground? That isthe challenge of our day,'' Jackson said.   He added, to cheers, ``Let's take a journey. Let's take ournation beyond anti-Semitism.''   In the past week, as the primary season draws to a close,Jackson has been making policy statements, coupled with a call forhis proposals to be included in the Democratic Party platform.   Last week in California, he released a five-year budget plan,and has been urging front-runner Michael Dukakis to adopt some ofhis foreign policy views. Dukakis is well ahead of Jackson in pollstaken in New Jersey and California.   The Massachusetts governor said Monday he expected Jackson wouldhave a role in his likely fall campaign against George Bush.Jackson concurred.   ``I expect to have a big role at the convention and a big rolethis fall,'' said Jackson. ``That role has not been determined ...I will exercise my own options.''   On Monday, Jackson observed Memorial Day with a call for worldpeace.   ``Study war no more,'' Jackson told a crowd as he campaignedhere. ``Nations must not rise up against nations.''   He also laid a wreath at a war memorial.   ``War is absurd. War is obscene. Peace is reasonable,'' saidJackson.   Earlier, at a rally at city hall in nearby Elizabeth, Jacksontalked about the thousands of Vietnam War veterans who cannotafford housing while the nation spends billions of dollars ondefense.   ``We're not just sacrificing veterans, we're sacrificing oldpeople, we're sacrificing sick people, we're sacrificing thehomeless,'' he said. ``I want to lead our nation beyond war.''</TEXT></DOC>
