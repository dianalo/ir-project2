(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A NASA investigative team hasidentified 83 potential sources of Columbia's dangerous hydrogenleaks, and exhaustive testing is expected to pinpoint the problem,the space agency said Wednesday.   The list of suspect parts was narrowed to 83 during an analysisof Columbia's engine compartment, said William Lenoir, head ofNASA's space flight program.   Hydrogen flooded the section during fueling last week, thwartingNASA's fourth attempt to send the shuttle on an astronomy mission.   ``Any combination might actually be the culprit,'' Lenoir said.   Workers will remove insulation from each suspected part and thenflush helium through the system, Lenoir said. If no leaks arefound, the process will be repeated with a different crew andequipment ``to try to be absolutely sure we haven't missedanything,'' he said.   If helium does escape, the test will be repeated in an attemptto ``really understand what that's telling me at that joint so Ican maybe make some correlations for the future,'' Lenoir said.   So far, Columbia's leaks have appeared only when the shuttle'sexternal tank is filled with highly flammable liquid hydrogen atsuper-cold temperatures, which might cause shrinkage of a metalpart and form the leak. The non-flammable helium normally used intesting is room temperature.   ``We know from our previous experience that our helium test hasnot found some of these leaks we thought it should have, and wewant to know why,'' Lenoir said.   The external tank will be filled with liquid hydrogen for aspecial fueling test around mid-October, after Discovery's upcomingflight. Discovery is scheduled to lift off Oct. 6 with a satellitethat will study the sun's polar regions.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans toperform a second tanking test on Columbia in November to see if allof the leaks have been plugged. About a dozen TV cameras will beplaced inside the engine compartment for both tests.   ``I'm hopeful we will have gone through this entire sequence andhave Columbia back in a flying sequence'' in December, Lenoir said.``We have specifically not laid that onto our engineering team.They're not driven by schedule. They are to go out and find theleak, find all of the leaks, and then we can get on with it.''   NASA plans no tanking test for Discovery, the only shuttle inwhich hydrogen leaks have not been found. Such a check would takefive days.   A tanking test will be performed on Atlantis before its earlyNovember flight. Hydrogen leaks were detected in fuel lines betweenthe orbiter and its external tank during a similar test in lateJune.</TEXT></DOC>
