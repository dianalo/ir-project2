Nabisco Biscuit Co. officials said plans call for spending $50 million this year and $100 million in 1990 to promote the new products, which are expected to be on store shelves this fall.    Company executives said the hefty financial commitment should dispel reports that the company's leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. would drastically cut product development and promotional spending.    Of the new entries, perhaps the most original is Suddenly S'mores, cookies that mimic the campfire concoction of chocolate bar, marshmallow and graham crackers. But instead of melting the cookies over an open fire, they go into a microwave oven.    Most of the other products are simply line extensions of existing best-sellers that don't represent much of an innovative gamble. They include Premium Bits and Triscuit Bits, both miniature-sized versions of the regular crackers. Other new products, including Oat Thins, which look like Wheat Thins, and Harvest Crisps will attempt to capitalize on the oat bran craze. Regional launches are planned this month for most of the new items. A national launch is planned for the second quarter of 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
