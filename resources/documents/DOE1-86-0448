At all the concentrationsof helium introduced no change in the phase composition and titaniumlattice parameter is detected, but anisotropic broadening of the X-raymaxima, which is related to the formation of He/sub n/V/sub m/ complexesis observed. During the annealing of irradiated titanium a decrease inthe unit cell in the range 623-673 K and an increase at 773 K are pointedout.</TEXT></DOC>
