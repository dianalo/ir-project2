MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Freshmen have become graduates. Ronald Reaganhas served a second term in the White House and retired. PresidentBush has come to office with an inaugural call for those who holdAmericans captive to free them and beget an era of good will.   And Terry Anderson, prisoner of Beirut, has seen none of it.   Incredibly, it has been four years since the Saturday morning thetelephone rang with word that Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, had been kidnapped by gunmenon the way home from a game of tennis.   At the time, it seemed to his editors and others among hiscolleagues that the kidnapping probably was an outrageous scaretactic aimed at reporters, and that Anderson would be held for aday, perhaps a few days.   That had happened before, to other journalists, in the chaosamong the factions still battling in Beirut.   But the days stretched into a sentence that has passed its fourthyear with no sign of a way out.   The signal dates that might be chosen for release _ a birthday,then another and another; the presidential election; the Bushinauguration _ have passed with no respite for Anderson. The firstand only declared demand of the captors was for the release ofradical Moslems imprisoned in Kuwait for terrorist activities.   In his inaugural address, Bush spoke of the hostages, Andersonand eight other Americans seized after he was taken. Reagan seldomhad spoken of their captivity since the scandal that embroiled hisadministration over the sale of arms to Iran. Three Americanhostages were freed in Lebanon during the arms deal period of 1985and 1986.   ``There are today Americans who are held against their will inforeign lands and Americans who are unaccounted for,'' Bush said.``Assistance can be shown here, and will be long remembered. Goodwill begets good will.''   In an interview, Bush was more explicit, saying that he looked toa day of better U.S. relations with Iran and saw the hostage issueas one that could help lead to such a thaw. He said that whileTehran clearly has influence over the captors, he is not certain theIranian government has clear control of the hostage situation.   At the same time, Bush said there would be no change in the U.S.policy against concessions or ransom to free hostages, a policyReagan declared but abridged during the arms sales. ``We are notgoing to escalate the currency of holding Americans hostages,'' hesaid.   One gesture that could be made within that framework remainspending but stalled. It is the standing U.S. offer of compensationto the families of 290 people killed when a U.S. warship mistakenlyshot down an Iran Air jetliner over the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988.   The State Department said the United States remains committed tocompensation payments, but that Iran has not provided informationabout the families, data needed to determine payment levels and setup a distribution system. The U.S. offer was to make paymentsdirectly to families, not through the Iranian government.   While the administration has barred concessions for hostagerelease, it has said it is willing to talk with the captors.   But there has been no direct contact, official or for hostagefamilies. That silence intensifies the frustration for Anderson'scolleagues who are, after all, communicators, accustomed to askingquestions, gaining information, getting answers.   So when they gather, as at Thursday's fourth anniversary, theydeliver to one another their message to the captors, words that mayfind a way to the faction holding Anderson in Beirut.   They say that holding Anderson and the other hostages is no wayto tell a story but is, instead, damaging the Moslem image. They saythat kidnappers keep out reporters who would otherwise come to learnand tell others about Lebanon.   They say that what is happening to Anderson and the others is sounjust as to be unthinkable.   ``This cannot continue,'' said Peggy Say, Anderson's sister.``Enough, for God's sake. Enough.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R. Mears, columnist, was executive editorof The Associated Press when Anderson was taken captive.</TEXT></DOC>
