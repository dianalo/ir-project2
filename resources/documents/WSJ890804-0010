These people say the rapid rate at which these traders are expected to be &quot;turned&quot; by the government suggests that the quality of the evidence against them was higher than many of their attorneys expected just weeks ago. Widespread cooperation also would indicate that the unprecedented probe could spread well beyond the initial groups of floor brokers and traders targeted on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, say the people familiar with the indictments, made Wednesday.    &quot;Once our agents have gathered evidence in a case like this, the next important step is getting insiders to cooperate with the investigation,&quot; says James D. McKenzie, head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Chicago field office. The indictments capped a 2 1/2-year investigation in which at least four FBI agents posed as futures traders on the two exchanges and gathered evidence, including secret tape recordings, of alleged futures trading fraud.    Mr. McKenzie, as well as U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas, declined to comment on the number of traders who were cooperating with the investigation.    According to exchange members and defense attorneys, traders who are cooperating range from relatively small traders such as Melanie Kosar in the Board of Trade's Treasury-bond futures pit, to John Eggum, formerly one of the most active CBOT soybean-futures traders. The exchange members and defense attorneys also said that others who are cooperating, such as Daniel Parz, a yen-futures trader on the Chicago Merc, are members of broker groups that include some of the most powerful traders on that exchange. Mr. Parz is a member of a group with John Baker and Thomas Crouch, who were indicted Wednesday and face possible seizure of assets and trading profits if convicted of racketeering charges.    Mr. Baker broke down and cried while trading on Tuesday when he learned that Mr. Parz was cooperating, traders said.    Lawyers for Ms. Kosar and Mr. Eggum declined to comment. Neither Messrs. Parz, Baker nor Mr. Crouch could be reached for comment.    Several traders who were indicted apparently decided within the past few weeks to cooperate with the investigation after they heard tape recordings made by the agents and other evidence of allegedly fraudulent trades in which they participated, people familiar with the indictments said. The quality of the evidence against them, rather than the threat of harsh penalties under anti-racketeering statutes, played a major role in their decision, defense attorneys said. A handful of traders have been cooperating for months.    &quot;The tapes are outstanding,&quot; says a lawyer who represents a trader now cooperating. &quot;They're crystal clear. Some of them have prices quoted in the background while orders are being filled at different prices. You can hear the numbers.&quot;    The apparent willingness to cooperate is a far cry from the public posturing of many defense attorneys in the months since the investigation surfaced in mid-January. These attorneys maintained that the investigation was based on technical trading violations that shouldn't be the subject of a federal investigation. Some attorneys still say this is the case.    Despite the barrage of publicity surrounding the indictments, several of those indicted returned to the pits on both exchanges. But it was hardly business as usual.    Traders on the Chicago Merc trading floor stood overlooking the Japanese yen-futures pit to look at where the indicted traders stood. &quot;There was a lot of speculating going on about who was going to go down next,&quot; said one trader.    Both exchanges have asked those indicted not to handle customer trades as brokers but have allowed them to continue to trade for their own accounts. One indicted soybean-futures trader arrived at the Board of Trade yesterday only to find that the exchange had mistakenly deactivated his membership identification badge, meaning he couldn't pass through a set of turnstiles onto the trading floor, an exchange member said. He said the badge was quickly reactivated.    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Wednesday named eight of the indicted traders as having settled administrative charges with the federal agency. The commission said the eight -- four in the Board of Trade's soybean-futures pit, three in the Chicago Merc's Japanese-yen pit and one in the Merc's Swiss-franc pit -- are cooperating with the federal inquiry.    Defense attorneys who read the indictments said at least seven or eight additional traders who were indicted also are already cooperating with the investigation. The attorneys made that assessment based on the fact that these traders were charged with only one or two counts of fraud in the indictments.    David J. Skrodski, a former soybean-futures trader, settled CFTC charges against him and has agreed to plead guilty to one count of mail fraud, which is a felony, and one count of pre-arranged trading, which is a misdemeanor, his attorney said. Mr. Skrodski began cooperating in May, shortly before he sold his seat on the Board of Trade.    The attorney declined to comment upon the extent to which Mr. Skrodski would provide information to the government about other traders.    Some attorneys said that their clients are cooperating, but that they aren't caving in to government demands for information on other traders. Craig LaCrosse, a soybean-futures trader, agreed recently to plead guilty to two counts of violating the Commodities Exchange Act, said his attorney, Matthias A. Lydon. Mr. LaCrosse is answering the government's questions about his actions, Mr. Lydon said.    But, the lawyer maintained, Mr. LaCrosse &quot;isn't implicating anybody in any fraud&quot; or &quot;acknowledging that he knows of any fraud of customers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
