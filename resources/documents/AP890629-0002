Twenty-five of 58 projects financed through the 12-year-old``Title Ten Land Development Mortgage Insurance Program'' havedefaulted, costing the government $90 million, the department said.   This program guarantees mortgages to finances land acquisitionand site preparation, such as street construction and sewer lineinstallation, for smaller developers who would include housing forlow-income and moderate income families in their projects.   About $500 million in loans has been guaranteed since 1977.   ``This program was an absolute disaster,'' said spokesman BobNipp.   Kemp said application fees will be returned for projects thathave not yet been approved. Projects with initial approval or withcommitments for funds will be reviewed ``to determine whether fraudor misrepresentation warrant the denial of government insurance,''he said.   The department will publish a proposed regulation to ``terminatethe program due to the enormity of the losses involved, highpatterns of abuse and the failure of the program to benefit theneedy,'' the department's announcement said.   The Reagan administration sought legislation to abolish theprogram but was unsuccessful. Kemp's proposed regulation will haveto remain open for a period of public comment before it can becomefinal.   Kemp ordered an examination of the program in April by thedepartment's inspector-general. Initial findings caused him to ordera complete audit of the program and related consultant activity, andthe circumstances of the recent approval of a loan for McNair Farmsnear Dulles Airport in the Virginia suburbs of Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
