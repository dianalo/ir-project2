After winning pledges from other oil exporters to freezeoutput at current levels, Saudi Arabia, the chief producer inthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, agreed toa temporary reduction in its percentage of OPEC output. Thatagreement made room for a bigger quota for the United ArabEmirates, a chronic overproducer.</LP><TEXT>   Finally, the kingdom nudged the UAE into accepting the newquota of 1.5 million barrels a day that it had previouslyrejected.   These developments set the stage for a likely newproduction agreement when OPEC's oil ministers meet late thismonth in Geneva, Switzerland. The expected accord wouldestablish a new output ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day-- an increase of 400,000 barrels aimed at accommodating theUAE's return to the fold.   Oil prices exploded on the news. In the U.S. stock market,oil stocks rallied sharply for the second consecutivesession. Some oil prices surged as much as $1 a barrel. Inthe U.S. futures market, crude oil for August deliverysettled 99 cents higher at $18.46 a barrel.   Petroleum prices had dropped by one-third since thebeginning of the year because of an oil glut brought on byOPEC overproduction. But prices began firming this week asSaudi Arabia hosted a meeting of five Persian Gulf oilministers to try to lay the groundwork for a solution to theoutput problem.   Among the ministers at the Jeddah meeting were those fromKuwait and the UAE, the two nations that have been blamed formuch of the overproduction that has kept OPEC output wellabove 23 million barrels a day.   In a grueling 12-hour session, according to peopleattending the meeting, Kuwait's new oil minister pledged tohold that country's output to its quota of 1.5 millionbarrels a day no matter what the UAE might do. Kuwait hasbeen producing about 1.7 million barrels a day, and the UAE,about two million a day.   &quot;That took care of 50% of the problem,&quot; said a sourceclose to Saudi Arabia's oil-policy decision makers. &quot;Theother 50% was the UAE,&quot; he said -- until late yesterday, whenKing Fahd of Saudi Arabia made a phone call to Sheik ZayyedBin Sultan Al-Nayyan, the president of the emirates.   The UAE has been insisting on a quota of two millionbarrels a day, its current level of output. OPEC had beenoffering it a quota of 1.5 million to put it at parity withKuwait, but the emirates rejected that, and so OPEC hadcontinued to list the UAE at its old quota of 1.1 millionbarrels a day.   Shortly after King Fahd's phone call, Mana Said Otaiba,the UAE oil minister, told Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oilminister, that he agreed to a national quota of 1.5 million.According to Mr. Nazer, OPEC's Vienna-based headquarters willbe informed of the UAE decision today.   It's hardly likely the UAE will quickly cut output byone-fourth, to 1.5 million barrels from two million. But evenif it only trims 200,000 barrels a day, that reductioncombined with cuts expected from Kuwait would drop OPEC'sdaily output to 23 million barrels or less for the first timethis year. Oil economists say that should satisfy the oilmarkets because it's in line with expected demand for OPECoil.   &quot;What they {the Persian Gulf producers} have done isdecide that price should have priority over volume,&quot; saidJohn Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation.   In a maneuver not unusual for OPEC, the lower productionlevel would be obtained by raising the production ceiling.That ceiling, now 22.1 million barrels a day, is expected tobe boosted to 22.5 million for the third quarter. Then aroundSept. 14 -- which will be the 30th anniversary of OPEC'sformation -- the oil ministers probably will meet again toestablish the ceiling for the fourth quarter.   &quot;The intention now is to lift the price to September,&quot;said a senior OPEC delegate from a Middle East producingcountry. &quot;Hopefully, by September, all the OPEC members willbe tending to their commitments, and the price will be higherthan $18.&quot;   The oil ministers meeting in Saudi Arabia this week saidearlier that their intent was to raise the price of the OPECbasket of crudes to &quot;at least&quot; $18 a barrel from the recentaverage of $14. OPEC prices usually trail U.S. prices.</TEXT></DOC>
