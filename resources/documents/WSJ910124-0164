Saunders</HL><DATE>01/24/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><LP>   This is America, land of free speech. And while many ofthose of us who support American involvement in the PersianGulf disagree with anti-war demonstrators, I should like tothink that most Americans would support the rights ofprotesters to speak out against the war. The right to dissentis fundamental. But the high cost of demonstrations,especially those involving violence and civil disobedience,ought to give this year's protesters pause.   No city makes that point better than San Francisco.Arriving in that beautiful metropolis last week, I sat in acab listening to a radio show. It was the night before thebig Saturday demonstration (attended by 40,000 according tothe police and 200,000 according to organizers).</LP><TEXT>   The moderator asked a guest whether demonstrations thatobstruct day-to-day living are counterproductive in that theyturn people off from the cause. The guest, an activist,replied that there are two theories on anti-wardemonstrations. One is that demonstrators should not disrupt,lest they alienate others. The second theory (needless tosay, the activist theory) is that the only way to stop a waris to block everyday life -- or &quot;business as usual,&quot; asprotesters often put it.   Put another way, it's the belief that you have the rightto disrupt the lives of others if you don't agree with them.And if you happen to disrupt the lives of co-believers, so beit. (As one activist told the Sacramento Bee, &quot;Forget aboutlobbying Congress. It's going to take student strikes,strikes in the factories, strikes in the harbors.&quot;)   This answer explained demonstrations held in San Franciscolast week. Protesters stopped traffic on the Bay Bridge,tried to storm the Pacific Stock Exchange and blocked theFederal Building for hours. They hit odd spots as well. OnFriday night, for example, 100 marchers even occupied thelobby of the Parc 55 hotel.   There was mayhem. Self-styled peace warriors spit at cops,threw rocks and bottles at them, and injured a couple. Theyset small bonfires throughout the city, set American flags onfire, toted protest signs and body bags, smashed windows,tore down scaffolding, blocked intersections, dumped redpaint and oil about, and torched a highway patrol car.   They even tossed newspaper racks into the streets.   San Francisco Examiner columnist Rob Morse noted thatpeace punks shot Super Glue into the locks of a Market Streetbusiness, costing one angry sandwich-shop owner $123 to openhis store.   Did it stop the war? Hell, no. These acts only mucked upbusiness-as-usual in a liberal city. The demonstrationsdidn't stop the Pentagon, but they did put a crimp in a citywhose council voted it &quot;a sanctuary for all persons who formoral, ethical or religious reasons cannot participate inwar.&quot; And that crimp could grow worse.   As the San Francisco Chronicle noted on Friday, &quot;Thedemonstrators included those who were anti-war and those whowere anti-government.&quot; Yet it's city government -- not thefederal government the demonstrators oppose -- that will paythe most.   As of Tuesday, City Hall spokesman Scott Shafer estimatedthe cost in police overtime alone to be approximately$900,000. That figure did not include the cost of bookingdemonstrators (more than 1,700 have been arrested to date andanother big demonstration is slated for Saturday), removinggraffiti or replacing vandalized equipment.   Mayor Art Agnos, who signed the sanctuary measure,sloughed off prewar protests as &quot;an insignificant disruption&quot;compared with the disruptions caused by war itself. Withindays of that statement, however, he began to note the cost ofdissent. Last week Mr. Agnos told the Examiner: &quot;Unlike thefederal government, San Francisco doesn't have a defensebudget to cut in order to pay for social programs. The onlyprograms we have are Health, Park and Rec., Social Services,Muni {transit} and other programs that serve people. Theseare the programs that are going to be shorted if the city isforced to {cover} unanticipated police costs for long periodsof time.&quot;   Mr. Shafer noted that the city has seen reduced policecosts as demonstration monitors have curbed the behavior ofviolence-prone provocateurs. Still, he cited a human factor.&quot;How long can {police officers} work 12-hour shifts withoutleave?&quot;   But even non-violent demonstrations that include civildisobedience are bound to add up. After all, Mr. Shafer'sestimates did not include the cost of booking or jailing anyof those who have been arrested and who are supposed to showup for sentencing in four weeks.   Many protesters argue that money spent on the war shouldbe spent on services -- as one sign said, &quot;Fight Crack, NotIraq.&quot; A group of demonstrators chanted &quot;Don't fight Iraq.Act up. Fight AIDS. Fight back.&quot; The irony is that theircivil disobedience won't cost the Pentagon or defensecontractors a dime but may mean less money for police, thehomeless or health services for AIDS victims. Free speech hasa price, and look who may pay for it.   Credit San Francisco Police Chief William Casey for havingthe right attitude. Asked why more protesters weren'tarrested during the early, more disruptive demonstrations, hereplied, &quot;This is not Lithuania.&quot; Difference is: InLithuania, the people have to fight to make their will heardby government -- and they still may fail. American troops arecarrying out the will of the people and Congress. In order tostop the war, protesters must find a way to change the mindsof other Americans.   San Francisco's demonstrations have been songfests sung tothe peace choir. The protesters might find that their refrainof &quot;Give Peace a Chance,&quot; accompanied as it is with civildisobedience and occasional violence, is not the effective(or cost-effective) way to persuade those who are notlike-minded.   ---   Ms. Saunders is an editorial writer and columnist for theLos Angeles Daily News.</TEXT></DOC>
