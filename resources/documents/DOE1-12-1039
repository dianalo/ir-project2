Differences in strength andthickness of particular sandstones cause the tremors generated withinthem and are characterized with different energetic distributions. Itmanifests itself in multimodality of histograms of tremor energy. Thepaper shows several examples of such histograms and discusses the influenceof multimodality on estimation of strong mining tremor repeatabilityby means of distribution of extremes. 6 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
