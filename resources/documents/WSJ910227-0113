In a hearing that offered a preview of the postwar debateover military spending and foreign aid, Republican and thenDemocratic members of the Appropriations Committee told WhiteHouse Budget Director Richard Darman yesterday they want morecontrol over spending on Desert Storm operations and onreplenishing depleted inventories.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There ought to be every care given to the constitutionalrole played by the Congress . . . in the disbursement ofthose monies,&quot; said Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, the seniorRepublican on the panel. Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, the topRepublican on the defense subcommittee, said much the samething.   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D., Tenn.)objected that the administration wants authority to spendmoney &quot;with essentially no congressional oversight.&quot; TheAppropriations Committee's powerful chairman, Sen. RobertByrd (D., W.Va.), didn't join the attack.   The administration is seeking approval to spend up to $15billion in U.S. funds as well as a promised $53.5 billion inforeign contributions to cover the costs of Operation DesertStorm. Instead of the traditional practice of asking Congressto appropriate funds to specific accounts, the administrationwants to deposit both U.S. and foreign funds into a &quot;workingcapital account&quot; from which the budget office and Pentagonwould transfer money as needed.   Mr. Darman said the administration would return to theTreasury any U.S. funds that aren't needed -- and said that aquick end to the war might mean that foreign contributionswill cover everything. &quot;It is not impossible that the totalcost will come in at $53.5 billion,&quot; he said.   &quot;There was no attempt to create a `slush fund,'&quot; Mr.Darman said. &quot;We have no interest in establishing a workingcapital account as a means to escape appropriatecongressional oversight or control.&quot;   Last fall's budget law -- in a provision that Sen. Byrdproposed over Mr. Darman's initial objections -- exempts fromdefense budget ceilings any Operation Desert Storm spendingabove what the military would have spent anyhow.   Mr. Darman has privately advised the Pentagon that loadingup a supplemental spending bill with questionable items couldbackfire and undo last year's carefully negotiateddeficit-reduction law. He insisted yesterday that the budgetoffice is adhering to a strict standard in determining whatare truly &quot;incremental&quot; costs.   But some senators remain skeptical. &quot;Will there be anyneed to replace this lost equipment,&quot; asked Sen. DanielInouye (D., Hawaii), chairman of the defense appropriationssubcommittee. And Sen. Tom Harkin (D., Iowa) complained thatthe Pentagon plans to buy 500 more Patriot missiles eventhough, by his estimate, it has fired no more than 140.   Mr. Darman said the administration would rebuild Pentagoninventories to the levels where they would have been hadthere been no war. But some in Congress, including HouseArmed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.), havesaid that some of the destroyed equipment needn't be replacedif the U.S. military is to shrink over five years as planned.   In any event, the Pentagon appears likely to emerge with astronger, if not larger, arsenal after the war than it wouldhave had otherwise. For instance, Deputy Defense SecretaryDonald Attwood said the Pentagon plans to use modernequivalents to replace old, out-of-production aircraft thathave been destroyed.   In all, the administration estimates the cost of the war-- from last August to the day troops return home -- at about$40 billion, plus the undetermined costs of actual combat.Using Pentagon figures, the private Defense Spending Projectputs combat costs at about $6.8 billion through Sunday. Thefinal price tag, of course, depends on the course of the war.</TEXT></DOC>
