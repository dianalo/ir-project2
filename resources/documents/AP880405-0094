Here is some of what they hadto say most recently:</TEXT><HEAD>ZIMBABWE</HEAD><TEXT>   _The Herald of Harare (government-controlled): ``A blackamerican, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, has for the first time inUnited States history emerged a front-runner. ...   ``Some see it as a divisive force, weakening his party's bid forthe presidency and, ultimately, if Jackson does win the Democraticticket, reducing the choice of president to a black versus whiteaffair, exacerbating old racial wounds and very probably openingnew ones. ...   ``It would be starry-eyed to give Jackson anything but anoutside chance of the White House. But it would be remiss of thenext administration to ignore the significance of his challenge.Jackson's dreams are those of many Americans, black and white.   ``They want new direction. And while domestic issues are boundto dominate, the call extends to a foreign policy so confused thatwhile rushing to impose sanctions on Panama it stubbornly refusesto back full economic sanctions against apartheid.   ``It is how far Jackson's challenge eventually goes towardsreshaping America's dealings with others that has the world'sattention as the presidential race progresses.''</TEXT><HEAD>SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD><TEXT>   _South African Broadcasting Corp. (government-controlled), in acommentary predicting the election of Vice President George Bush inNovember: ``As it did in the last election, the Democratic Partyseems intent once again on contesting the presidency with a man whohas virtually no chance of winning against the Republicancandidate. ... This year they seem determined to nominate in Mr.Jesse Jackson, a candidate who even Democratic Party leaders admitis unelectable.   ``Nobody likes to say it out loud, but the Jackson phenomenonand the dilemma it has created for the party are almost entirely amatter of racism in America. Both his present leadership positionin the party primaries and the impossibility of his being electedpresident are due first and foremost to the fact that Mr. Jacksonis black.''</TEXT><TEXT>   _Carl Noffke, director of the Institute for American Studies atRand Afrikaans University, speaking to the South African Instituteof International Affairs, as quoted in The Citizen of Johannesburg(pro-government): ``The elevation of the Rev. Jesse Jackson to aposition of leadership presents a considerable crisis to the(Democratic) party. Because of the color of his skin, his opponentswill do everything humanly possible to try to prove that they arenot racists.   ``One can therefore expect an increase in anti-South Africansentiments in the coming months, in the same way in which SouthAfrica became the political whipping boy of the 1984 presidentialelections, when the Democrats were divided.''</TEXT><HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD><TEXT>   _The Financial Times of London (independent): ``Mr. Jackson'sstrength could transcend racial boundaries. More than any othercandidate from either party, he is talking about issues that affectthe common man and woman. The Reagan years may have created morewealth for many Americans but they have not much reduced theunderclass, which cuts across color lines. This constituency, nolonger the automatic fiefdom of the Democrats and now poorlyrepresented by the trade union movement, is there to be galvanized....   ``So, if it is up to George Bush to prove, in the wider arena,that he is not Ronald Reagan, it is up to the Democratic Party tofind room for Jesse Jackson, and he has not yet begun to bargain.It is debatable which challenge is the more daunting.''</TEXT><TEXT>   _The Independent of London (independent): ``The way is now clearfor a Bush nomination. ... The disarray in the Democratic camp isjust what the White House doctor ordered. The traditional wisdom isthat another liberal, ethnic ticket, weighed down with Jacksonianbaggage, would be tantamount to electoral suicide for theDemocrats. Yet that is what appears to be forming.'' </TEXT></DOC>
