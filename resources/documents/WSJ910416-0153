The justices will hear an appeal involving the Mississippisystem, which includes the University of Mississippi,Mississippi State University and six other schools. The highcourt's ruling, according to the NAACP Legal Defense andEducational Fund Inc., will also affect a number of otherstate systems, including Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Maryland,Kentucky and Pennsylvania.</RE><TEXT>   The obligation of states to end segregation in theirpublic universities stems from the Supreme Court's landmark1954 decision in Brown vs. the Board of Education, whichdeclared that separate but equal facilities wereunconstitutional.   Now, almost four decades after the Brown decision, thehigh court must decide whether the Constitution and federalcivil rights laws require a state to do more than justreplace its policy of racial segregation with one that isneutral.   Civil rights lawyers argue that a state has a broader dutyto actively integrate its universities, not merely to endformal segregation policies. They argue that the Mississippisystem has eliminated the policies of segregation but not theeffects of those policies.   State officials counter that they have met theirobligation to eliminate separate black and white universitysystems, and contend that that's all the law requires ofthem.   In approaching this issue, the Supreme Court may have toreconcile two of its own seemingly conflicting precedents.   In 1968, the high court ruled that in desegregating publicelementary and secondary schools, educators must make aserious effort to integrate black and white students,teachers and facilities, not merely to provide voluntarychoice to students. Civil rights lawyers argue that the sameobligation should apply to state colleges.   But in 1986, in a decision involving the North CarolinaAgricultural Extension Service's 4-H Clubs and farmereducation programs, the high court ruled that the 1968decision didn't apply to voluntary associations andactivities, and that the duty to desegregate required no morethan neutral policies for admission.   The federal appeals court in New Orleans relied on the1986 4-H Clubs decision when it ruled in September 1990 thatthe Mississippi system had met its obligation to desegregate.   The case was appealed to the high court by black residentsof Mississippi who say that the state university system isstill largely separated into five white and three blackinstitutions. Of 51,807 students in the system in 1986, theysay, 14,600 were black, and of those blacks, 70% attendedschools with few white students.   The state denies these allegations and says it has madeadequate progress toward desegregation and has providedstudents a fair choice about what higher education programsto pursue.   The case was also appealed to the high court by theJustice Department, which argued that the Mississippi systemdoesn't provide the same opportunity to blacks and whites.(U.S. vs. Mabus; Ayers vs. Mabus)                                                                                                          Home State Bank                                                                                                          The justices let stand the convictions of Marvin Warner,former owner of the Cincinnati-based Home State Savings Bank,and David Schiebel, its former president.   Home State collapsed in 1985 shortly after ESM GovernmentSecurities Inc., a Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., firm, was declaredinsolvent. Home State had a loss of more than $140 million ongovernment securities in repurchase agreements with ESM. HomeState's failure caused a run on other Ohio banks that, likeHome State, were insured by the Ohio Deposit Guaranty Fund. Astate banking crisis ensued.   Mr. Warner was convicted of six counts of unauthorizedtransfer of bank funds to pay ESM and of three counts ofsecurities fraud. He was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prisonand was ordered to make restitution of $22 million. Mr.Schiebel was convicted of the three securities fraud countsand was sentenced to six months in prison. An Ohio appealscourt threw out the convictions, but the state Supreme Courtreinstated them in October 1990, though it ordered the trialjudge to hold additional hearings on the issue ofrestitution. (Warner vs. Ohio)                                                                                                          PCBs Lawsuit                                                                                                          The high court let stand a federal appeals court rulingreinstating lawsuits against General Electric Co., MonsantoCo., Amtrak and Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authorityfor injuries allegedly caused by exposure to polychlorinatedbiphenyls, or PCBs, in the Paoli railroad maintenance yardwest of Philadelphia.   The lawsuits were filed in 1986 by 38 people who livednear or worked in the yard. They alleged that exposure toPCBs, chemicals used in railcar transformers, caused avariety of illnesses. A federal judge dismissed the personalinjury claims before trial in 1988, but the appeals courtreinstated them for trial in September 1990. (GeneralElectric Co. vs. Knight)                                                                                                          Fining Lawyers                                                                                                          In two separate cases, the justices let stand finesimposed by federal district judges against prominent civilrights lawyers for filing frivolous lawsuits.   In one case, a federal judge in North Carolina imposed$122,834 in fines on three lawyers, including civil libertiesactivist William Kunstler and a University of North CarolinaLaw School professor, Barry Nakell. In the other case, afederal judge, also in North Carolina, imposed a $20,767 fineagainst Julius Chambers for a lawsuit he filed before hebecame director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in 1985.   The fines in both cases were imposed under Rule 11 of theFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, which was made tougher in1983 by giving federal courts the authority to imposesanctions for filing frivolous lawsuits. Critics of the rulehave charged that it's having a chilling effect on civilrights lawsuits, but law school studies show there's littleevidence of this trend.   The fine imposed on Mr. Kunstler was for a 1989 lawsuitagainst state and local officials in Robeson County, N.C.,alleging that they were harassing people who were aiding apetition drive by an Indian rights activist. The lawyers whofiled the suit asked that it be dismissed after a few months,and the defendants agreed but later asked for the sanctions.   The sanctions against Mr. Chambers stemmed from a 1981class action against the Army, alleging racial discriminationin civilian hiring.   In both cases, a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va.,upheld the liability for sanctions but ordered the amountreconsidered. The new amount hasn't yet been determined inMr. Kunstler's case, but $20,767 is the final figure in Mr.Chambers's case. (Chambers vs. U.S. Department of the Army;Kunstler vs. Britt)                                                                                                          Gun Regulations                                                                                                          The high court refused to hear the National RifleAssociation's challenge to several federal gun regulations.The justices let stand a ruling by the federal appeals courtin Richmond that upheld the authority of the TreasuryDepartment's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Adoptedin 1988, the regulations include a requirement that licensedgun dealers keep records of firearms sales from theirpersonal collection, as well as from their businessinventory.

The justices willreview a Tennessee Supreme Court decision that the state'sban on electioneering within 100 feet of the polls violatesthe First Amendment by singling out political speech.
