Gorbachev inMoscow eight days from now.   Unless the Senate speeds up its pace, ``the chance of havingthat little package with the blue ribbon tied around it in thepresident's pocket by the time he goes to Moscow are going todiminish daily and hourly,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,D-W.Va., said late Friday.   The problem is that conservative Republicans opposed to theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty have used Senaterules to delay action, according to Senate GOP leader Bob Dole ofKansas.   ``Right now, it looks like Republicans may be dragging theirfeet,'' Dole said. ``I'm optimistic, but less so than I wasyesterday.''   The Senate has to approve the treaty itself and then separatelyapprove the resolution of ratification. It is now considering thetreaty and opponents have blocked efforts to move on to theresolution.   ``As I see the situation, if the Senate doesn't complete work onthe treaty on Monday, it is going to be increasingly difficult towrap up work on the resolution of ratification by next Saturday,''Byrd said.   A frustrated Dole noted that opponents have refused even to sayhow many amendments they will offer.   ``There shouldn't be any mystery, if you have five amendments or10 or 50 or just three. ... My view is that as long as everybody isup front, we know where we are. That's all that I ask. ... Whennobody will communicate, it's pretty hard to tell how manyamendments there are.''   The treaty, signed Dec. 8, provides for the elimination withinthree years of all atomic-tipped missiles with a range of 300 to3,400 miles.   In votes Friday, the Senate:</TEXT><TEXT>   _Rejected, 73-8, an amendment by Sen. Gordon Humphrey, D-N.H.,to delay implementing the INF treaty until the president certifiesthat NATO has increased its ammunition stocks from the presentseven days to at least 15 days.   The Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies have superior numbersof non-nuclear weapons.   ``Since I cannot hope to succeed in the adoption of thisamendment, I hope to clarify the effect of this treaty on thesecurity of NATO and in particular on the 325,000 U.S. troops inWestern Europe,'' Humphrey said prior to the vote.   ``Without nuclear weapons in Europe,'' he said, ``our forceswould be annihilated or at best captured. ... That's why we havenuclear weapons there, to prevent the annihilation of our troops.''   The treaty would remove medium-range missiles carrying nuclearwarheads from Europe and elsewhere. But it would leave thousands ofbattlefield and other nuclear weapons with ranges shorter than 300miles in addition to U.S. nuclear warheads on aircraft.   _Rejected, on five votes by overwhelming margins, a plan by Sen.Steve Symms, R-Idaho, that would have barred the INF treaty fromgoing into effect until Reagan certified the Soviets were in fullcompliance with five previous arms control agreements. AlthoughReagan has said the Soviets violate those agreements, the WhiteHouse opposed Symms' amendments.   All five sections of Symms' proposal were rejected inback-to-back roll call votes of 85-11, 87-10, 86-11, 82-15 and 89-8.   Dole called the proposal a ``killer amendment,'' and othersenators denounced it as an obvious attempt to slow Senateconsideration of the INF treaty.</TEXT></DOC>
