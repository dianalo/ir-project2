The shearer has been changed from the radio-controlled model tothe microcomputer operated machine, while automating various functions.In addition, a system for comprehensively examining operating conditionsand natural conditions in the working face for further automation. Theselfadvancing frame has been modified from the sequence controlled modelto the microcomputer aided electrohydraulic control system. In orderto proceed further with automation and introduce robotics, detectors,control units and valves must be made smaller in higher reliability.The system will be controlled above the ground in the future, providedthat the machines in the working face are remote controlled at the gatewhile transmitting relevant data above the ground from this system. Thus,automated working face will be realized. (2 figs, 1 photo)</TEXT></DOC>
