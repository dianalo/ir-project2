Ford counters that its recall work on the ambulances has beenmore than adequate and that some ambulance operators have been slowto bring in the vehicles for repairs.   The American Ambulance Association, a Washington-basedorganization representing private ambulance operators, said Fridayin a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationthat it had received reports of long delays, unavailable parts,shoddy work and added bills for fixing the ambulances.   ``It would appear that a significant number of ambulances arestill not fully retrofitted,'' the association wrote.   Ford recalled about 14,500 of the vehicles, converted toambulances by other companies from the 1983-1987 Ford EconolineE-350 models, after reports of fuel-system problems that causedfires.   The recall came in two phases, one in July 1987 for rerouting ofthe fuel line and a second in August 1987 for installation offurther safety precautions.   More than 20 fires were reported and were blamed onoverpressurization of fuel tanks and lines caused by muffler heat.   ``We feel (the recall) is certainly more than adequate,'' saidMike Parris, a Ford spokesman in Dearborn, Mich. ``We're concernedwith it. We don't take it lightly at all. We don't drag our feet.... We've made every effort to try to get these people in here toget this recall taken care of.''   He said some 700 Ford dealers had parts available for the recallwork. ``If these people will bring these vehicles in, they can haveit done,'' Parris said.   Eighty percent of the recalled ambulances were brought in forthe first phase of work, but only 65 percent have undergone thesecond phase, Parris said.   NHTSA has 120 days to respond to the ambulance association'spetition.</TEXT></DOC>
