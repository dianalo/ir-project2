Trading volume in biotechnology stocks such as Amgen, Cetus, Centocor and Genetics Institute has slowed as much as 30% since April 4 while volume stayed relatively flat on the New York Stock Exchange and the overall Nasdaq over-the-counter market, says analyst Stuart Weisbrod of Prudential-Bache Securities. Meanwhile, biotech stock prices have underperformed the Nasdaq Composite Index by as much as 6%, he adds.    &quot;Biotechnology has been a tough group to make money in,&quot; says Teena Lerner, who follows the industry for Shearson Lehman Hutton. &quot;Investors want some real success stories now.&quot;    Although he is bullish for the long term, Mr. Weisbrod doesn't see any silver lining in the months ahead. &quot;This (negative) trend will continue for another six to nine months even if the market rallies,&quot; he warns. According to the analyst, stocks with particular risk include Biotechnology General, California Biotechnology, Integrated Genetics and Biotherapeutics, which trades on the American Stock Exchange. None of these companies is close to breaking even until 1992, and many others are closer to being profitable, Mr. Weisbrod says.    In the midst of a general anxiety about the stock market, the reasons for investor malaise toward biotechnology aren't hard to find. Sales of the TPA heart drug made by industry leader Genentech -- a drug once touted as the industry's first blockbuster medicine -- have fallen far short of the lofty goals set by analysts. Other drugs have become embroiled in lengthy and confusing patent disputes. And clinical trials of many of these promised drugs are taking longer than projected.    (Genentech, once one of the Nasdaq market's prized stocks, moved to the Big Board last March.)    There simply are too many publicly traded biotechnology companies, according to Jeffrey Casdin, publisher of Biotech Investor, an industry newsletter. Spurred by the bull market of 1986 and early 1987, many small biotechnology companies went public with inexperienced management and immature products. &quot;Most of them should have remained private, venture-backed companies,&quot; says Mr. Casdin.    Still, others argue that the biotechnology revolution continues at breakneck speed; it's just that investor perceptions have changed.    &quot;Investors got caught up in the emotionality of the business. Their expectations were unrealistic,&quot; says Steven Burrill of Arthur Young andamp; Co. The industry has begun to develop and market new products and over half its revenue now is from product sales, Mr. Burrill says. Strategic alliances with major drug companies have provided new market outlets and new equity.    But some people aren't sure how positive these alliances are for investors. Historically, much of the revenue from product sales has gone directly to strategic partners instead of the company, according to Ms. Lerner of Shearson Lehman.    Chiron receives an estimated 3% to 5% of revenue from the sales of the hepatitis vaccine it developed for Merck; the rest stays with Merck. And most of the revenue from the human insulin developed by Genetics Institute goes to Eli Lilly, which currently markets it.    For long-term investors committed to biotechnology, analysts continue to hold out hope. Ms. Lerner is recommending Amgen and Cambridge BioScience because of products they plan to launch this year. And she recommends Xoma, which will file two applications for product approval with the Food and Drug Administration in the next six months.    Mr. Weisbrod is also recommending Amgen and Xoma for the same reasons, and he also likes Applied Biosystems and Genzyme. Both companies are already profitable and plan to introduce a steady flow of products into the market.    ---   Friday's Market Activity   The Nasdaq OTC composite index gained 1.21 to 383.91, its ninth advance in 10 sessions, to hit a five-week high. Advancing issues led decliners, 1,049 to 869.    Princeville Corp. gained 1 5/8 to 14. Qintex America, which already owns 53.4% of the resort operator's shares, said it is considering buying the remaining ones for an undetermined price.    Acme Steel declined 2 3/4 to 23 after the iron and steel fabricator bought back the 572,500-share stake held by a group led by investor Irwin Jacobs. The group, which had mounted an unsuccessful $23.50-a-share takeover bid, agreed not to reacquire Acme stock for five years.    Multi-Local Media surged 1 1/4 to 14 1/8. A management group began a $14.25-a-share tender offer, higher than the original $14-a-share bid.    L.A. Gear gained 1 1/2 to a 52-week high of 20 1/8.
