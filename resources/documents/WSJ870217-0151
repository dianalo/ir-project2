The swap offer, part of a plan to cede control of the troubled telecommunications concern to an investor group including former and current Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. executives, is the company's second in a year. The first, which was proposed last March by Drexel, then acting as the company's investment bank, was terminated last September when certain bondholders refused to participate and when a related merger of Western Union into its telegraph subsidiary was defeated.    Documents filed last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission also disclose that the investor group in combination with Drexel holds large portions of certain key Western Union securities. The investor group is headed by Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Pacific Asset Holdings L.P. and MDC Holdings Inc., a Denver home builder. Pacific Asset was founded by Gary Winnick, a former senior vice president of Drexel working in that firm's high-yield, high-risk &quot;junk&quot; bond operations until August 1985, according to the filing and past interviews. Other Drexel executives, through a separate entity, are limited partners in Pacific Asset.    In addition to exchange offers, the latest restructuring proposal, like the old Drexel plan, requires and is contingent upon settlement of bank debt, a merger of the parent into its telegraph company subsidiary and a cash investment in the resulting company. Unlike last year, the banks this time agreed to a discounted repayment of the $273 million Western Union owes.    But analysts said the Pacific Asset group's plan won't benefit holders of common because, like the old Drexel plan, it vastly dilutes their holdings. Nor is it certain that the investor group, by selling telecommunications assets and turning the company into a consumer financial services concern, can make common shares much more valuable, analysts said. Western Union said, however, that the alternative to the Pacific Asset group's plan probably is reorganizing under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts.    Under the latest plan, Western Union's shares outstanding would increase to 196 million from 24.4 million, if all warrants and convertible securities are exercised. The Pacific Asset group, which is proposing to put $250 million into the company in return for $250 million of senior secured debt, also would get as much as 39% of the resulting common shares outstanding. Once in control of Western Union, the investor group would sell assets to repay their $250 million, using extra money to buy new businesses.    Western Union said that by proposing to exchange its 12 issues of existing debt for two new issues of preferred shares, it would reduce total debt, excluding accounts payable, to $413 million from $924 million as of Sept. 30, 1986. Dividends on the new preferred would be payable in cash or, in some cases, other preferred shares.    Western Union plans to file a proxy statement in two weeks outlining the proposed merger of it and its subsidiary, which is meant to resolve preferred dividend arrearages of $56 million. In the merger, holders of the parent and telegraph company preferred shares will get, for their old shares, issues of the same preferred being offered to debtholders.    Western Union also said that through Drexel, Pacific Asset last March bought about $9 million of a $32 million privately placed issue of 15% telegraph subsidiary notes, whose maturity last month was extended to May 29 from Feb. 1. Had Pacific Asset refused to extend the maturity, it could have forced the company into a Chapter 11 filing, Western Union said.    A Western Union executive said, however, that Pacific Asset didn't use its ownership of the 15% notes to persuade the company to extend to May 29 the investor group's exclusive contract to restructure and take control of Western Union. Western Union has received, and refused to accept, a competing investment proposal from a group headed by Resource Holdings Ltd., New York. Western Union has to pay Pacific Asset $20 million if it negotiates with another group while under contract with Pacific Asset.    Drexel and Pacific Asset also own certain other Western Union publicly traded debt. Pacific Asset, MDC and Drexel also together own 6.5% to 33.2% of other telegraph and parent company publicly traded preferred stock issues.    So far, Pacific Asset received $7 million in fees and payment of expenses from Western Union. In 1986, Drexel received fees and expense reimbursements totaling $7.3 million from Western Union and now works for Western Union for free. Western Union has agreed, however, to indemnify Drexel against certain liabilities including those that could occur under the federal securities laws, the SEC filing said. </TEXT></DOC>
