The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in an unrelated case that a preliminary agreement between a corporate buyer and seller didn't constitute a binding contract.    If the issue sounds familiar, it's because it was the key question in the Texaco trial in 1985. That case turned on whether Pennzoil had a binding agreement to purchase part of Getty Oil Co. after the parties announced what they called an &quot;agreement in principle.&quot; A Texas jury found that the agreement was binding and that Texaco had interfered with it by swooping in with a higher offer for Getty.    A judgment against Texaco for more than $10 billion survived a number of appeals, and Texaco ultimately settled the case for $3 billion. But, for procedural reasons, a federal appeals court never ruled on the contract-law issue.    Such a ruling has now come in a case involving the planned $13.8 million sale of Arcadian Corp.'s phosphate fertilizer business to Arcadian Phosphates Inc., a new entity created to make the purchase. Arcadian Corp., based in New York, is a unit of Sterling Group Inc., Houston.    Late last week, the Second Circuit said in that case that a preliminary sales agreement is unlikely to be binding when some of the contract terms are still open to negotiation and a final contract document is contemplated before the deal can be completed.    The court said it found no enforceable contract in the Arcadian case in part because the preliminary agreement didn't specify that &quot;a firm commitment&quot; or a &quot;binding agreement&quot; had been reached. &quot;As a practical matter, it's a signal that unless all the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed, a contract is not likely to be enforced,&quot; said Stephen Houck of the law firm of Donovan Leisure Newton andamp; Irvine, counsel to Arcadian, which won the contract claim. Arcadian Phosphates had sought $53 million in damages.    Said Richard Miller, the Houston trial attorney who led the Texaco defense team in the 1985 trial, &quot;If we had that {Arcadian precedent}, we would have been in high cotton. I'm just sorry it wasn't on the books when the Texaco case came down.&quot;    The Arcadian case won't affect the Texaco settlement or the court decisions that preceded it. But it may ease the minds of corporate executives and lawyers who feared that, after the Pennzoil case, they might be subject to suits for backing out of preliminary agreements in principle.    In the Arcadian dispute, the buyer and seller signed a memorandum of agreement that specified the purchase price, the timing and amounts of the payments, the fixed assets to be purchased and a final acceptable date for closing. But the memorandum left open the form of payment, allowed further negotiations concerning a service-and-supply agreement that would follow, and made certain provisions for the possibility that the negotiations would fall through.    When phosphate prices shot up before the deal could be completed, Arcadian changed its negotiating position and sought new contract terms. Arcadian Phosphates, in turn, sued for breach of contract and also sought damages for expenses it had incurred as a result of the anticipated deal.    Writing for a three-judge panel of the appeals court, Chief Judge James Oakes approvingly quoted a lower court decision that stated, &quot;There is a strong presumption against finding binding obligation in agreements which include open terms, call for future approvals and expressly anticipate future preparation and execution of contract documents.&quot;    Judge Oakes noted that &quot;a party that wishes to be bound {by a preliminary agreement} can very easily protect itself by refusing to accept language that shows an intent not to be bound.&quot;    In the Texaco case, the preliminary written documents also left a number of contract terms open to negotiation and provided that the deal was &quot;subject to a definitive merger agreement,&quot; which had not been completed. Pennzoil's lawyers focused on handshakes and other actions that they said suggested that the parties nonetheless wished to be bound by the deal.    Mr. Houck, the Arcadian lawyer, said the Texaco case would easily fall within Judge Oakes's category of cases in which a preliminary agreement wouldn't be binding. As in the Arcadian case, the Texaco case was governed by the contracts law of New York state.    &quot;This is evidence that the court sitting in New York takes a much more skeptical view of preliminary agreements than did the Texas courts,&quot; acknowledged Edwin Mishkin of Cleary Gottlieb Steen andamp; Hamilton, which represented Arcadian Phosphates. However, he said that each case must be decided on its facts and that the key issue in such cases remains whether the two sides intended to be bound by their preliminary agreements.    Pennzoil's trial counsel in the Texaco case, G. Irvin Terrell of Houston's Baker andamp; Botts, also cautioned against assuming that the Second Circuit would have decided in Texaco's favor. &quot;Whether a contract is formed is dependent under New York law on the particular intent of the parties as evidenced by the particular facts,&quot; he said, &quot;so a holding in one case may not be applicable to another set of circumstances.&quot;    But lawyers who represented Texaco and the various Getty entities said the Second Circuit decision was a clear repudiation of the Pennzoil rulings, and they only lamented its timing.    Said Texaco outside counsel Francis Barron of Cravath Swaine andamp; Moore, &quot;This new case just confirms what everybody thought before. It's too bad Texaco's appeals couldn't have been decided by judges like the ones who serve on the Second Circuit.&quot;    The Arcadian case did provide some solace to Arcadian Phosphates, the jilted buyer. The court permitted the case to be returned to the trial court for consideration of whether the company incurred expenses when it relied on a promise that Arcadian would negotiate in good faith. If the court finds in Arcadian Phosphates' favor, Arcadian might be ordered to reimburse Arcadian Phosphates' costs or pay damages. </TEXT></DOC>
