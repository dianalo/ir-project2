Draude, director of the DMR's Implementation Coordination Office,said at the FGIPC meeting.andM;Some of the past problems with defense procurements might have been avoidedif officers played a more integral role in the acquisition process, Draudesaid, agreeing with Hilmes.andM;A DOD systems manager who attended the meeting said he doubted Pentagonofficials could ensure acquisition officers they would advance.andP;  &quot;You don'tgo to the top of any chain of command unless you have warrior skills,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;Once you get into the accounting field or the ADP field, you're dead.andO;That's not going to change.&quot;andM;Increasing the number of military officers in DOD weapon systems acquisitionsdoes not necessarily mean civilians will be ousted, Draude said.andP;  Many DODsystems maintain and support common administrative activities.andP;  Civilianacquisition staffs could shift their emphasis toward these procurements, hesaid.andM;But the DMR recommends many staff reductions, and Draude acknowledged thesecuts may be deep.andP;  &quot;I can't sugarcoat a bayonet,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
