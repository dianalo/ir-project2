Attorney James McElroy said he planned to go after all theMetzgers' assets, including their home, bank accounts and cashcontributions sent to their white supremacist organization, theWhite Aryan Resistence.   ``We will have the very nice irony of those who are contributingto WAR putting money in the pockets of the victims of their hate. Ithink that's poetic justice,'' McElroy said.   The elder Metzger did not immediately return a telephone messageThe Associated Press left at his television repair shop inFallbrook, 65 miles north of San Diego.   Monday, a Portland jury ruled in a wrongful death lawsuit thatMetzger, his 22-year-old son, John, and two of their followersshould pay damages to the family of a black man beaten to death byracist ``skinheads.''   The jury found that the Metzgers and WAR helped incite the hateand violence of the Portland skinheads, including those involved inthe 1988 beating death of Ethiopian immigrant Mulugeta Seraw.   McElroy is an associate of Morris Dees, the lead attorney forSeraw's family. The attorneys have donated their time and anyassets seized from the Metzgers will go to Seraw's father and son,McElroy said.   The asset forfeiture proceedings are expected to take weeks.   ``We have two goals: to compensate the family for the loss oftheir son,'' McElroy said. ``The second goal is to put Mr. Metzgerout of the hate business. This is a for-profit business. This ishow he makes his money. He peddles hate and hate turns intoviolence.''   McElroy said the Metzgers will have to testify and producedocuments at the assets hearing.   Attempts to hide assets or improperly transfer them to someoneelse's control could lead to further penalties or even criminalcharges, he said.   McElroy said he already has blocked a move by Metzger totransfer ownership of the family's $90,000 home to his wife's name.   Meanwhile, the Metzgers show no signs of abandoning their whitesupremacist preachings.   ``Don't think, because of the recent court proceedings inPortland, Ore., that our activities will cease,'' vowed a messageon WAR's telephone hot line.   ``This case has convinced us to go the extra mile, take theextra steps to put the blood on the streets. We're putting thesystem on notice that if you want to play hardball with the bigboys, you'd better be prepared to pay the piper.''</TEXT></DOC>
