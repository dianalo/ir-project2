The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had snapped a string of four consecutive losses with a gain of 6.30 points Tuesday, plunged about 48 points by early afternoon, then recovered a bit to close 37.80 lower at 1965.85.    New York Stock Exchange volume swelled to 176.7 million shares from 131.2 million Tuesday, largely because of selling prompted by the concerns over rates and because of dividend-related activity in several utility stocks. One of those issues, Consolidated Edison, was the Big Board's most active stock on 21.5 million shares. It fell 1/2, to 42.    Among broader market averages, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.31, to 253.31, and the Big Board's composite index retreated 2.27, to 143.48. Declining Big Board issues swamped advancers, 1,343 to 256.    Investors didn't react directly to major banks raising their prime lending rate to 9% from 8 1/2%, but rather to their growing concern that interest rates will keep climbing for a while.    Traders also attributed yesterday's downturn to the persistence of futures-related sell programs, despite previous announcements by five major securities firms that they were suspending stock-index arbitrage trading for their own accounts.    Early in the session, stock prices were driven down by a statement by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who was quoted in The Wall Street Journal/Europe as saying that a coordinated move by major industrial countries to raise rates in the future is possible.    Later, however, the report was amplified and viewed as less significant a portent of higher rates.    By that point, major money-center banks had launched a move to increase the prime rate. The rise was the first since before the market's collapse last October and followed confirmation from Beryl Sprinkel, President Reagan's chief economist, that the Federal Reserve Board had boosted short-term rates.    Concerns about rates also triggered a sell-off in the stock-index futures market, which caused June Sandamp;P 500 futures to drop to discounts of as much as one full point to the cash index. This created the opportunity for index arbitrage involving the purchase of futures and the sale of the underlying stocks. Traders said this type of activity played a significant role in the stock market's retreat.    The latest round of index arbitrage took place as Donald T. Regan -- former Treasury secretary, White House chief of staff, and Merrill Lynch chairman -- testified before the Senate Banking Committee that the practice should be banned to restore public confidence in financial markets.    Prudential-Bache Securities Chairman George L. Ball went even further in his testimony by suggesting that trading in index futures could be limited or abolished altogether in order to cure the volatility that has plagued the stock market in recent months.    Joseph H. Barthel, director of technical strategy at Butcher andamp; Singer, Philadelphia, blamed the market's retreat in part on its weak response Tuesday to the news of the cuts in index-arbitrage trading.    Mr. Barthel added that the market appears to have entered a period of decline which is likely to continue, &quot;barring any interim rallies,&quot; until early July. Any unexpected disappointment could accelerate the slide in stock prices, he said.    David Dreman, a managing director at Dreman Value Management, countered that the market's concerns about rates and inflation are being exaggerated and that any positive developments on either front could turn stocks around.    &quot;Generally, the market is still pretty shaken up,&quot; he said. &quot;Once we see that interest rates aren't going to skyrocket and that inflation won't skyrocket, we're going to see some further strength.&quot;    All 30 stocks in the industrial average ended the session lower. International Business Machines fell 2 1/8, to 108 3/4; F.W. Woolworth slid 1 1/4, to 52 3/4; Bethlehem Steel slipped 5/8, to 18 1/4; United Technologies retreated 1 1/4, to 37 1/4; and International Paper skidded 1 3/8, to 41 7/8.    Among stocks which bucked the market's retreat, the biggest winner was Tech-Sym, which surged 2 1/4, to 14 1/2. Mason Best, a Dallas investment firm, boosted its stake in the company to 5.1% and said it may raise or lower its holding depending on its &quot;evaluation of the need&quot; to control or influence Tech-Sym, among other things.    Dayton Hudson gained 1 1/2, to 35 5/8, amid speculation that Woolworth might attempt to acquire it. Several analysts told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that they were highly skeptical of the rumors. Woolworth declined comment.    WMS Industries added 3/8, to 7 7/8. Sumner N. Redstone, chairman of National Amusements, said he intends to seek federal clearance to acquire control of WMS. Mr. Redstone said he and his company hold a combined stake of 23.7%.    Symbol Technologies advanced 3/4, to 43 1/4. The company received a subcontract valued at more than $20 million over three to five years from Intermec in connection with the Army's implementation of barcode technology.    Novo Industri rose 1/2, to 28 5/8. The company said first-quarter net income rose to 99 cents a share, from 75 cents a year earlier, and said it expects sales and earnings this year to exceed last year's levels. Also, Novo signed a letter of intent to acquire Zymogenetics, a Seattle-based bioscience company, for $23.2 million.    Gerber Products, which has retained Salomon Brothers to seek a buyer for its furniture unit, fell 1/4, to 39 5/8. Gerber said it would take a charge of 94 cents a share for the fourth quarter ended March 31 to reflect the expected sale of the group. </TEXT></DOC>
