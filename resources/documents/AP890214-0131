His brother, Joseph Cicippio, is one ofthe nine Americans held captive.   The eight-foot card was put on display at the WashingtonConvention Center where people are free to sign it. After severaldays, it will be taken to the Lebanese Embassy to be held until thehostages are released.   While no one has any firm word about the nine Americans inLebanon, David Reed of Spring Grove, Pa., nephew of hostage FrankReed, said there were signs ``indicating a great deal of quietdiplomacy'' on the issue.   ``Our hope is that there is some movement,'' he said. Based onhis conversations with officials at the State Department and theUnited Nations, Reed said, ``our sense is that the captors don'twant to talk.''   The American hostages are thought to be held by pro-IranianShiite Moslems, specifically groups under the umbrella Hezbollahorganization.   Joseph Sayah, deputy ambassador at the Lebanese Embassy, saidthere were ``a lot of negotiations talking place between the U.S.side and the others,'' but he would not elaborate on any specifics.   ``I hope something will be done so we can put an end to thisordeal,'' he said.   The ceremony with the card was arranged by No Greater Love, ahumanitanian organization which has spotlighted the plight of thehostages and their families.   ``While we realize this greeting will not directly bring thehostages home, it does let their families know that many, manyAmericans still care,'' said Carmella LaSpada, the group's head.   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, a correspondent forThe Associated Press, whose fourth anniversary in captivity is nextmonth.   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, did not attend the ceremony becauseshe has extended her stay in Damascus, Syria, awaiting word of herbrother.   Others at the ceremony were Steve Hagey, a reporter for TheBaltimore Sun, representing the Journalists Committee to Free TerryAnderson; John Holger, director of the U.N. information office, andretired Army Col. Leland Holland, a former hostage at the AmericanEmbassy in Tehran.</TEXT></DOC>
