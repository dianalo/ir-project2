The deposit consists of a high-gradeore body containing approximately the same amount of uranium as the expectedinventory of a disposal vault. The deposit has a relatively simple geometryand groundwater flow system. Since 1984, data have been collected andcompiled on the hydrogeochemistry and hydrogeological characteristicsof the site, to study the distribution of uranium and associated elementsin and around the deposit. As a part of this study, a simple model hasbeen developed and tested for explaining the spatially varying part ofthe lead distribution in the sandstone above one region of the deposit.The observed distribution can be explained using reasonable values ofthe transport parameters. More detailed information about the site isrequired to test and refine the model further.</TEXT></DOC>
