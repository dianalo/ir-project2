Rorer Pharmaceutical Corp. of Fort Washington, Pa., contends inthe suit filed in federal court in New York that Pepto-Bismol'slabeling, advertising and promotion are ``false and misleading.''   In its suit, Rorer contends ``sweeping,'' unsubstantiatedstatements by Pepto-Bismol's maker, Procter andamp; Gamble Co., have hurtthe sales and reputation of Maalox, Rorer's 40-year-old antacid.   Rorer officials declined to estimate how much money they havelost in sales, but the suit calls the sum ``substantial.''   Teri Glover, a spokeswoman at Procter andamp; Gamble's headquarters inCincinnati, said the company had not seen the court papers andcould not comment.   Procter andamp; Gamble acquired 88-year-old Pepto-Bismol in 1982 whenit bought Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals, which also is named as adefendant in the suit.   Rorer's suit also alleges that a new Maximum StrengthPepto-Bismol is being sold with a higher dosage than approved bythe U.S. Food and Drug Administration.   In addition, Rorer said, it is disturbed that Procter andamp; Gamblecontends Pepto-Bismol treats a host of ailments, includingheartburn, indigestion, nausea and upset stomach.   Rorer contends Pepto-Bismol is effective against only heartburn,fullness and nausea caused specifically by overindulgence in foodand alcohol.   ``The FDA has specifically found that Pepto-Bismol is noteffective for most of the claims for which it is promoted,'' saidthe suit, filed Thursday.   Brad Stone, an FDA spokesman, said the agency had no comment onthe suit.   The Maalox line of over-the-counter antacids is the best-sellingantacid in the nation and the world. It had U.S. sales exceeding$105 million last year, giving it about 15 percent of the marketfor antacids, said Richard Driansky, a vice president and chiefcounsel for Rorer, a division of Rorer Group Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
