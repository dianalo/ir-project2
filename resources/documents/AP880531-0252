A zebra. A rhea bird? A trioof bear cubs. No problem. Demand for wilder wildlife is sizeableand the suppliers ever ready. That pleases animal dealers andcustomers who, for benign and not so benign reasons, go for exoticanimals, even on a dinner plate. The trend bothers the increasinglyactive animal rights groups and others who are disposed to raisemoral as well as ecological issues.</TEXT><TEXT/><BYLINE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A classified ad in a Pittsburgh newspaper:``Celebese Ape, 14-week-old baby, diaper-trained, sucks finger;also cougar andamp; bobcat babies andamp; other exotic animals.''   The man placing the ad says he had plenty of animals to sell,and what he didn't have at the time, he could get.   ``There's nothing God put breath into I can't get,'' said JimLedbetter, who until recently ran an exotic animal business inUniontown, Pa. ``If you want a zebra, elephant or whatever, noproblem.''   Ledbetter went on to say he could get a black panther, anendangered animal, for $2,000, but added they don't make good pets.``In Florida, there's a guy who sells them for $6,000 a pop,'' hesays.   Young elephants go for $20,000 each, old ones about $15,000, hesays. White tigers are about $50,000 each, $90,000 for a pair.Cougars are $975, bobcats, $875.   ``Everything I sell is cheap,'' he says.   In the United States, the world's largest consumer of wildlife,trading in exotic animals is entirely legal, as is ownership inmost places, subject to some state and local restrictions. That hasspurred animal rights groups into intensifying efforts to regulatethe industry.   David Herbet, captive wildlife specialist for the Humane Societyof the United States in Washington, believes private ownership is a``total misuse of wild animals.''   About 90 percent of all wild animals die within the first twoyears of captivity, regardless of whether they were captively bred,he says.   ``Wild animals should be ... left in the wild,'' echoes DougInkley of the National Wildlife Federation in Washington.   Faced with increasingly vocal criticism and the hostility ofanimal rights groups, dealers generally have become wary ofpublicity. At a recent auction in western Ohio, a sign prohibiteduse of cameras and recording equipment and a non-uniformed guardcarrying a holstered gun searched one visitor's handbag. Peoplewith cameras were escorted off the grounds.   The exotic animal business is booming, according to the U.S.Department of Agriculture.   An estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people in this country own, breed,exhibit or sell wild and exotic animals, says Pat Hoctor of PrairieCreek, Ind., publisher of the Animal Finders' Guide, one of thelargest publications in the country devoted to the trade.   ``The vast majority are people who have them as a hobby,'' hesays. Of that number, about 300 could be considered professionalanimal dealers, many of whom sell their wares through guides likeHoctor's or at several auctions held regularly throughout thecountry, particularly the Midwest.   Among their customers:   _A Minnesota couple that keep a chimpanzee, lion and tiger intheir basement, a boa constrictor in the bathroom and a baby skunkin their living room.   _A private game ranch in Wallisville, Texas, where would-bebig-game hunters who don't have the time or money to travel toAfrica can stalk captive-bred lions for $3,500 a crack _ ``a bettertrophy at half the price,'' says owner Larry Wilburn.   _A processing plant in Warren, Mich., and meat wholesaler in SanBruno, Calif., which sell big-game meat, including lions,hippopotamus, reindeer and eland, to restaurants eager to satisfythe latest national fad for low-cholesterol, not to mention exotic,meats.   _A Florida farm that raises ostrich, emu and rhea for hides _the latest trend in cowboy-boot leather.   _A roadside menagerie in Pennsylvania where children can peteverything from mice to elephants.   _A tavern in Ohio where the owner's pet chimpanzee smokescigarettes and swigs six-packs of beer to the delight of patrons.   In many places, a private owner is free to lead a lion on aleash or keep a baboon in his back yard. He also is free to treat,feed and house the animal as he pleases.   Certain groups feel such practices should be outlawed becausemany species pose a danger to public safety and the environment.   They also cite the case of a lioness called Abby, crippled at 6months because her Ohio owners fed her improperly, to make a pointthat too few people know enough to properly care for an exoticanimal.   Animals that have to be taken from an owner because of abuse orneglect or that grow too big or unmanageable face an uncertainfuture.   ``The problem with those animals is that when they do becomemean and can't be handled, the first thing people do is call thezoo to donate it,'' says Charles Wickenhauser, director of thePittsburgh Zoo. ``We certainly don't want an animal like that. Theyhave psychological problems and need special treatment to get themback into a particular group of animals.''   Hoctor gets upset on hearing about people abusing their animals,either willfully or from ignorance. But he says the follies of someshouldn't tarnish the entire group of owners and breeders who trulyenjoy their animals and know more about them and care for thembetter than many zoos.   ``Just because zoos are the commonly accepted places for animalsdoesn't mean they're the authorities. Zoos are living museums.Breeders know what animals need,'' he says.   ``People see us holding things in cages. They misconceive thatwe are raping the wild. We are actually the experts on the wild,''says Hoctor, who raises lions, tigers, waterfowl and assorted otheranimals and birds. ``While do-gooders are making a big stink abouthow they love the wild, we're actually saving the wild'' throughbreeding efforts.   Animal dealer Bob Troumbly of Grand Rapids, Minn., concedesthere are considerable abuses and few safeguards.   ``A lot of people buy this stuff for macho stuff,'' saysTroumbly, 31, who operates Northland Wildlife. ``This is America.There are a lot of injustices in this world and that's just one ofthem. There's always somebody out there willing to sell to somebodythey may not feel is qualified.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
