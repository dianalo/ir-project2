(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Susan and Ted Blew are having funthese days growing vegetables on their 160-acre farm, making somemoney and raising three children in wide open spaces only 45minutes from the smokestacks of industrial Newark.   Things weren't always so good.   For five years, they struggled, saddled with a six-figuremortgage and a floating interest rate that reached 16 percent.   Theirs was a Catch-22 situation. To make more money to pay themortgage, the Blews rented 1,000 more acres and grew wholesalegrain. They considered it drudgery, and, worse, the new loans onlyadded to their debt.   Then, about two years ago, they found a way to pay off theirmortgage, keep their Hunterdon County farm for their children andmake money growing what they wanted: They sold development rightsto their land to the state of New Jersey as part of a farm landpreservation program.   More and more state and local governments are giving toppriority _ and tens of millions of dollars _ to farm landpreservation programs, efforts to save rapidly vanishing open spacefrom developers. The trend is spreading from the Northeast, whereit started, to the South and West.   The government assesses the land's value for farming andcompares that to its higher worth for housing or commercial use,such as a mall. The farmer is offered the difference in dollars inreturn for an agreement that the land can never be sold fordevelopment. The farmer keeps the property and can still sell it,but its deed will be restricted to farming or open space use.   The Blews received almost $900 an acre or $143,500 from thestate and county, which split the cost. That same day, Dec. 19,1985, they turned the check over to the bank, paying off theirmortgage, on which they had been making payments of close to$10,000 every six months, and an outstanding business loan.   ``We had $10 (left) to go to lunch,'' Ted said. They celebratedat a Ponderosa restaurant with steaks and chocolate milk. ``It cameto $10.12,'' said Susan, smiling.   The Blews can afford to smile now. The pressure is off.   ``It relieved the pressure of that exploding interest rate,''Ted said. ``You enjoy working when you're making some money, whenyou're able to pay your bills and have something left over.''   New Jersey's share of the money came from a $50 million bondissue voters approved in 1981.   Other states with similar farm land and open space preservationprograms include Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, NewHampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.   Local programs exist in Boulder County, Colo.; Forsyth andMecklenburg counties in North Carolina, whose respective seats areWinston-Salem and Charlotte; King County, Wash., around Seattle;and Northern California's Marin and Solano counties. In CollinCounty, Texas, north of Dallas, officials are trying to raise fundsfor land preservation.   Over the last decade, almost 100,000 acres of working farm landhave been saved, said Jim Riggle, director of field operations forAmerican Farmland Trust in Washington, D.C., a non-profitorganization that works to conserve agriculture.   The success of preservation programs, however, doesn't meandevelopment is being slowed.   Riggle estimated that since World War II, some 70 million to 100million acres of U.S. agricultural land has been converted tocommercial or residential use, or has been used for highway orother public works projects. That leaves no more than 1.2 billionacres of privately owned open land nationwide, of which 575 millionare being farmed or have a high potential for farming, while therest remains unused for crops because of its lesser quality.   Roughly 3 million acres of farm land are being lost every year,he said.   ``Six out of 10 of the most productive agricultural counties areeither already classified in metropolitan areas or adjacent tothem,'' he said. ``That's where the action is taking place. Thereis a general degrading of the quality of our land in this country.''   Development pressure in Massachusetts remains strong even thoughthe state has already spent $45 million to buy up rights andpreserve nearly 20,000 acres. The Legislature last Decemberapproved an additional $35 million for the program.   Why? ``You're preserving the economic fabric of the rural area.It has an additional benefit. It's a working landscape,'' repliedAugust Schumacher Jr., Massachusetts commissioner of food andagriculture.   Ron Allbee, Vermont's commissioner of agriculture, agreed.   ``We sell Vermont to tourists for the pristine open space, forthe small villages,'' Allbee said. ``I think there's a broaderconcern. If we lose our agriculture, we're going to lose whatpeople identify as Vermont.''   Even in big cities, such as Philadelphia, voters areoverwhelmingly approving bond issues to buy up the rights. Thereare many reasons.   In Pennsylvania, which is just beginning its program aftervoters approved a $100 million bond issue in November, agricultureis the No. 1 industry.   Pennsylvania has 56,500 farms that produce crops worth $3.2billion a year and generate $35 billion in related business. Butsince 1960, the state has lost 50,000 farms and 3.8 million acresof land that went out of production, most of it believed to be fordevelopment.   Along with economics, sentiment helped the pro-preservationforces, state Sen. Noah W. Wenger said.   ``Even people that live in the cities can remember theirgrandfather or their uncle living on a farm,'' he said, ``and theyhave a certain affinity to that and I think that was in its favor.''   But even more, Wenger said, was the realization that about 20percent of all the jobs in the state are related to agriculture.   ``It's just good business sense to take care of your No. 1industry,'' he said. ``You would spend $100 million to keep a basicindustry intact so that that industry can continue to pay taxes andprovide jobs so that we will have funds available to support oursocial programs, our research programs.''   Other referendums approved last November included a $65.2million bond issue to help preserve open space in Rhode Island.   And New Jersey voters, in their second referendum on the issuein six years, overwhelmingly approved raising the state's share forfarm development buyouts to 80 percent, making it easier forcounties with limited funds to become partners.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
