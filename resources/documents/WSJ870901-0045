Traders said that the broad bearish sentiment on the currency remains intact and that yesterday's upward move wasn't significant, because many traders were absent.    Activity was substantially curtailed by a bank holiday in London, which is usually the world's busiest currency trading center. Some other traders declined to participate in the market on the last day of the month or chose to wait for today's release of July's leading indicators for the U.S. economy.    &quot;This was one of the quietest days of the summer, but there's no real change in sentiment,&quot; Jeff Mondschein, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York, said.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8160 West German marks, compared with 1.8115 late Friday. The U.S. currency also climbed to 142.50 Japanese yen from 141.90 and to 1.4983 Swiss francs from 1.4930.    Increased activity in the Iran-Iraq war spurred the dollar's rise in Tokyo trading, as did small purchases of dollars by the Bank of Japan. The central bank's intervention followed last week's efforts by several national banks to counter the dollar's weakness. The dollar resumed drifting downward in European trading before turning back up in New York.    At a meeting in Zurich yesterday, Swiss National Bank President Pierre Languetin said last week's intervention by central banks in the foreign exchange market was &quot;in support of the Louvre accord.&quot;    He said the accord, reached by the U.S. and some of its major allies at a February meeting in Paris, called for international cooperation to stabilize exchange rates at around the levels prevailing at that time. &quot;That is around 1.50&quot; Swiss francs to the dollar, he said. Although Switzerland wasn't a party to the accord, the Swiss central bank has indicated support for it.    In a speech at the Zurich meeting, U.S. Federal Reserve Board Governor H. Robert Heller said the Louvre accord has been a &quot;resounding success&quot; as far as stabilizing exchange rates is concerned.    Later, however, he said that &quot;more concrete progress&quot; is needed on coordinating the economic policies of the major industrial nations.    He also said that the Fed has intervened in the past six months &quot;in the framework&quot; of the Paris accord and that &quot;we haven't heard any complaints from our fellow central bankers.&quot;    In his speech, Mr. Heller said that the dollar is &quot;now at a more sustainable level&quot; and that &quot;U.S. competitiveness has improved and the trade balance has begun to improve in real terms.&quot; However, he said, &quot;We cannot sit back and make the dollar do all the work to restore our external balance.&quot;    Separately, in West Germany, Deutsche Bank AG asked the foreign exchange trading committee of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to include the Australian dollar in the daily Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing, a spokesman for the exchange said. The Australian dollar would be the 18th currency to be officially priced daily against the mark in an auction-like process among representatives of major West German banks.    The spokesman said the committee hadn't yet reached a decision on the Deutsche Bank request.    The Australian dollar has gained in importance as a result of a recent boom in Eurobonds and other international financings denominated in the currency.    Motions to include other currencies, such as the Hong Kong dollar and the European currency unit, aren't being considered at the moment, the exchange spokesman said. The European currency unit represents a basket of European currencies valued against the dollar.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $2.50 an ounce to $450.60 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was three million ounces.    The dollar was quoted at 141.95 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    ---               LATE NEW YORK TRADING               Monday, Aug. 31, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
