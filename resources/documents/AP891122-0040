On a pair of quick voice votes that belied the preceding monthsof partisan battling on both issues, the Senate sent both measuresto President Bush, who was expected to sign them.   ``The end product is one I think we can take some pride in,''Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., told hiscolleagues as they began considering the budget cutting bill atabout 1:45 a.m.   About an hour earlier, the House voted 272-128 to approve thedeficit bill.   After the vote, House leaders made their traditionalend-of-session telephone call to President Bush, who was asleepwhen the 12:47 a.m. call was made.   ``We've had a good session,'' House Majority Leader RichardGephardt, D-Mo., told the president. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,D-Wash., and Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., also spoke oflawmakers' accomplishments, while Michel added apologies for``waking you up at this ungodly hour.''   Bush was roused again, however, at 3:48 a.m. when SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Republican Leader BobDole of Kansas telephoned him to report the chamber's work wasfinished.   ``When all the dust settles, I think you had a pretty goodsession of the whole Congress,'' Bush told the two leaders.   The Senate adjourned for the year at 4:07 a.m., while the Housefollowed 24 minutes later.   Earlier in the evening, the House _ as it has been doing forweeks _ insisted that Medicare benefits for elderly people withlong-lasting diseases be completely repealed. Lawmakers rejectedSenate language retaining parts of the program by 346-55, and votedby voice to eliminate the entire program.   The Senate decided to finally accept repeal, rather than returnto their districts to face seniors angry over the surtax they mustpay to support the initiative.   Lawmakers also became embroiled in a conflict with the Bushadministration over whether the executive branch's foreign policypowers should be restricted.   The House stripped language offensive to the White House out ofa bill authorizing State Department operations for the next twoyears and sent the new bill to the Senate hopes of finishing themeasure before adjournment. But the legislation became the victimof a jurisdictional dispute between committees and will awaitaction next year.   The measure contained a provision stemming from the Iran-Contrascandal providing criminal penalties if the administrationpressured foreign governments into carrying out policies that breakAmerican law. The administration believed the language could tieits hands in discussions with other governments.   And they passed a series of other measures, ranging from Senateapproval of a resolution condemning violence in El Salvador toHouse adoption of a measure proclaiming National Drunk DrivingAwareness Week.   Debate on a $14.7 billion deficit-reduction bill for the currentfiscal year was delayed as lawmakers worked out differences on thefinal shape of the measure.   Congressional leaders and the Bush administration had agreed tothe deal in negotiations that ended in Tuesday's early morninghours. But they had to spend nearly 12 hours preventing strayprovisions _ such as an effort to put the Fairness Doctrinerequiring broadcasters to give equal time to differing viewpoints _from finding their way into the measure.   The deficit-cutting package contained some actual savings aswell as some only on paper, such as shifting the money-losingPostal Service off the budget. It also relies heavily onacross-the-board cuts triggered last month by the Gramm-Rudmandeficit-reduction law, a mechanism most legislators see as anunthinking way of shrinking federal spending.   The day began with a rhythm that has become familiar to Capitoldenizens in recent days: little action on the floors of both housesbut many closed-door meetings to hammer out final deals.   Layered over that was an atmosphere often observed in theclosing days of school: a tangible restiveness to go home for theyear, which leaders promised would occur if the deficit-cutting andMedicare bills were completed.   ``People have made up their minds,'' said Rep. Jack Buechner,R-Mo. ``They have their families packed up in cars and they'reready to go home for Thanksgiving.''   The deficit-reduction package culminated a year of turmoil thatstarted with a much-heralded budget pact between Congress and theWhite House.   But that degenerated into bitter partisan fighting overPresident Bush's ill-fated attempt to slah capital gains tax rates.Because of the gridlock, the Gramm-Rudman law chopped $16.1 billionfrom most federal programs Oct. 1, excluding Social Security andmany other benefits.   Democrats and Republicans agreed that the deal worked out metBush's demands for $14 billion in legitimate savings. White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president considered it ``anexcellent bill.''   It lets the Gramm-Rudman cuts stay in effect until earlyFebruary, producing savings of $4.6 billion. Over the entire 1990fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the reductions would cut domesticprograms by 1.5 percent and defense spending by 1.4 percent.   The package also raises $6 billion in new taxes, most levied oncorporations. Of the total, $2.7 billion comes from speeding uppayroll, gasoline and aviation tax collections, a step theadministration insists is merely an accounting gimmick netting noreal new revenues.   Another $400 million comes from including deferred compensation_ such as the earnings some employees place into 401(k) retirementplans _ in the formula that determines the amount of wages subjectto Social Security taxes. That could require workers in the $50,000range to pay Social Security tax on slightly more of their earningsbeginning in 1990.   Reductions in Medicare, mainly cuts in payments to doctors andhospitals, would save $2.8 billion. Cuts in deficiency payments forcorn and other crops would save $235 million, boosting NuclearRegulatory Commission fees would raise $54 million and extending a1 percent fee for Veterans Affairs housing loans would net $169million.   On the more questionable side, the package claimed savings of$1.7 billion for ignoring the Postal Service's projected losses and$700 million by stretching out retirement payments to federalworkers.   In their other undertaking, lawmakers set about rolling backcatastrophic care benefits for 33 million senior citizens that wereenacted last year with broad popular support.   The cheers turned to boos this year when many older Americansbegan complaining about the surtax imposed to pay for the benefits.That tax peaked at $800 for the most well-to-do 40 percent ofsenior citizens.   As enacted in 1988, the benefits covered long-term doctor andhospital bills, prescriptions and minor expenses such asmammography and hospice care.</TEXT></DOC>
