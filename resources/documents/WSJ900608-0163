Now, 35 are.   In his opening remarks this week to top executives fromthe industrial world's leading banks, Rainer Gut, chairman ofCredit Suisse, made a second telling -- and, to Americans,disturbing -- observation: In 1976, seven of those bankshailed from California; but now, &quot;three of those are owned bythe Japanese and one has withdrawn from internationalbusiness.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Douglas Kidd, a senior vice president at Bankers Trust Co.in New York, said that &quot;a major part of our growth over thepast five years has been overseas&quot; because of constraints onwhat the bank can do in the U.S. &quot;You have our taxes movingoffshore and our employees moving offshore,&quot; he said.   Nobody in the room needed to be reminded that U.S. banksaren't as competitive as they used to be. In the past fewyears, many have retreated from international business, orsold operations to meet new international capitalrequirements, and watched foreign banks gobble up anever-increasing chunk of the U.S. market.   This trend threatens to damage the competitiveness of U.S.industry -- especially the export sector -- and erodesrevenue in industries that serve banks, such as computercompanies, according to analysts and bankers. It also meansfewer jobs.   Moreover, the growing foreign presence in the U.S. raisesconcerns about the concentration of economic and financialpower, especially in terms of doling out credit to U.S.industries and companies that compete with foreign ones.   U.S. offices of foreign banks now control roughly aquarter of U.S. banking assets -- Japanese owners aloneaccount for 14% -- compared with 14% foreign control in 1982and 3.8% in 1973. The consolidated U.S. assets of sixJapanese banks would rank them among the 30 largest U.S. bankholding companies, and &quot;a couple would be within strikingdistance of the 10th largest banking organization in theU.S.,&quot; according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York.   At the same time, U.S. banks are shedding businesseseither to help stay afloat or to meet international capitalstandards planned for 1992. In the past few years, ChaseManhattan Bank sold a Dutch bank with $5 billion of assets toFrance's Credit Lyonnais, and BankAmerica Corp. sold itsItalian bank to Germany's Deutsche Bank AG. Just last week,Bank of Tokyo Ltd. closed its $500 million purchase of Bankof New England Corp.'s leasing unit.   Noting that U.S. banks are unloading operations in Asia aswell as in Europe, Alexis Wolkenstein, head of theinternational division of Credit Lyonnais said, &quot;I don'tunderstand the American banks; they are giving up markets andrelationships that took years to build.&quot; He added: &quot;This is aloss to the U.S.; it gives it less influence in the world.&quot;   At home, U.S. banks suffer from excess capacity -- thereare simply too many banks -- as well as from geographiclimits on where they can take deposits and restrictions onwhat products they can sell. U.S. banks also have shotthemselves in the foot, lending billions of dollars todeveloping countries that may never be able to repay them andlending too much to the real estate and oil industries in theU.S.   John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, said the company wantedthe right to take deposits anywhere in the U.S., in additionto securities powers and possibly the right to underwrite andsell insurance. &quot;Clearly, the geography thing killed us, andthe degree to which industrial companies are in ourbusiness,&quot; Mr. Reed said. &quot;It takes a lot of banking businessaway from us.&quot;   Charles S. Sanford Jr., chairman of Bankers Trust, said,&quot;Not having securities powers makes U.S. banks lesscompetitive with European banks, and this will be exacerbatedwhen Japanese banks get more powers.&quot;   Meanwhile, 15 years of unsteady economic growth andvolatility in the inflation rate in the U.S., plus thenation's deteriorating trade position and its low savingsrate &quot;have all contributed to a financial environment thatbreeds difficulties at home and contributes to slippageabroad,&quot; E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed,said in recent congressional testimony.   In the Far East, U.S. banks face rich, aggressive Japanesebanks; in Europe, powerful banking institutions are allowedto enter businesses in their home markets -- such asinvestment banking and insurance -- that are denied to U.S.banks in their own markets. Europe's big banks also stand togain from the planned 1992 abolition of trade and financialbarriers among the 12 countries of the European Community.   The turmoil in the Japanese stock and bond markets thisyear resulted in lower earnings for Japanese banks and chewedup some capital represented by stock they hold in Japanesecompanies. But Kaneo Nakamura, president of Industrial Bankof Japan Ltd., and Teruyoshi Yasufuku, deputy president ofSanwa Bank Ltd., both said that talk of a pullback by Japan'sbig banks was exaggerated. &quot;The markets {in Japan} haveimproved, and the {Japanese} economy is strong,&quot; Mr. Yasufukusaid.   &quot;It will still be several years until Japanese banks'advantages in cost of equity and borrowed funds dissipates,&quot;said Perry Quick, a principal at Quick, Finan andamp; Associates,an economic consulting firm in Washington.   And while U.S. banks still are regarded as leaders infinancial innovation and sophistication, &quot;our lead intechnology is narrowing,&quot; he said. &quot;Japan is developing itsown financial technology or buying it.&quot;   U.S. banks are also considered to be more profitable thanmany of their foreign competitors. Nonetheless, Mr. Reed ofCiticorp said that neither the West German nor the Japanesestock markets penalize their banks for their lowprofitability. By contrast, the shares of many U.S. bankshave been severely depressed.   The West German banking system, said Hans-Georg Engel,resident counsel at J.P. Morgan andamp; Co.'s Frankfurt branch, isone of the world's strongest. Because its big universal bankscan bank anywhere in the country, and can trade stocks andbonds and sell insurance, &quot;they are less exposed to cyclicalshocks,&quot; he said. &quot;The universal banks are well-capitalized,have good asset quality, weren't hurt by the stock marketcrash in 1987 and have absorbed their LDC {less developedcountry, or Third World lending} problems.&quot;   In his testimony, Mr. Corrigan of the New York Fed saidthat the U.S. is &quot;the only major country that does not have atrue national banking system.&quot; Even after the planneddismantling of some barriers to interstate banking, he said,the U.S. will still be left with a &quot;crazy-quilt pattern&quot; ofstate and federal laws and regulations.   Structurally, the U.S. banking system is increasinglyviewed as obsolete, especially when rapid technologicalchange is creating instruments that blur traditional productlines. Moreover, many corporations whose credit ratings arehigher than those of banks now can raise money through bondand stock markets, bypassing U.S. banks altogether.   &quot;Financial services have become commodities available froma number of differing bank and non-bank sources, anddistinctions between products have faded,&quot; said CynthiaGlassman, director of research for Furash andamp; Co., a consultingfirm in Washington.   Noting that a European corporation can have all itsfinancial needs met by a single institution, she said: &quot;AU.S. company has to go different places for a loan,underwriting and insurance. The difference is like buying acar and buying the parts separately to build the car.&quot;   Mr. Engel of Morgan said: &quot;If a Volkswagen, a Lufthansa ora BASF asks you to do for it in America what you do for it inEurope, you're forced to say you can't, even though it's yourhome market, your currency and the world's major currency.That has a tremendous impact on the competitiveness of U.S.banks.&quot;   As Mr. Corrigan himself testified last month: &quot;The U.S.banking system is simply out of step with the rest of theworld, and more importantly, it is out of step with therealities of the marketplace.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
