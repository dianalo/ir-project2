States are additionallyrequired under section 172(a)(2) and (b)(3) of the CAA, and as elaboratedin the April 4, 1979 ``General Preamble for Proposed Rulemaking on Approvalof State Implementation Plan Revisions for Nonattainment Areas,'' to revisetheir ozone SIP to include Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT)regulations for stationary sources whenever a Control Technology Guideline(CTG) document is published that is applicable for photochemical oxidantsources in the State.In November 1983, EPA published a CTG document titled ``Control of VOCEmissions from Manufacture of High-Density Polyethylene, Polypropylene,and Polystyrene Resins.'' In December 1984, EPA published an additionalCTG document relating to VOC sources titled ``Control of VOC Emissionsfrom Air Oxidation Processes in Synthetic Organic Chemical ManufacturingIndustry.''In response to the requirements of Section 172(a)(2) and (b)(3), the PennsylvaniaDepartment of Environmental Resources (PADER) submitted a draft ozone SIPrevision to EPA on February 14, 1986, which incorporated the recommendationsmade in these two CTG documents. EPA sent a number of comments on the proposedrevision to PADER, which were addressed as part of public hearing on March12, 1986. As a result of this process, PADER revised its draft and subsequentlysubmitted the proposed SIP revision for EPA processing on January 14, 1987.The proposed SIP revision calls for incorporating the PADER ``plan approvals''and operating permtis applicable to the individual sources covered by thetwo CTGs into the SIP rather than adopting statewide regulations, becauseso few sources are affected. There is only one source in the state coveredby the polymer resin CTG_Arco's Monaca, Beaver County, polystyrene plant_and one source covered by the air oxidation CTG_IMC's Seiple, Lehigh County,formaldehyde plant.The ARCO permit conditions (permit No. 04-313-052) stipulate that the VOCemissions from each bulk polymerization process will not exceed 0.12 poundsper 1000 pounds polystyrene produced. This corresponds exactly to the emissionlimitation described as representative of RACT for polystyrene plants inthe CTG. The permit further stipulates that the expiration date on thepermit is for state purposes only, and that the permit conditions willremain in effect as part of the SIP until such a time as EPA approves arepeal of the SIP provision. The PADER ``plan approval'' relating to theARCO facility contains specific mechanisms by which ARCO is required tomeet the applicable emission limitation, including a provision that dailyrecords be kept for two years of the collection vessel temperature andthe vacuum system pressure. The permit, therefore, together with the planapproval, satisfies all RACT requirements for this facility.The air oxidation processes CTG defines RACT as 98 percent reduction byweight in total organic compound emissions, or as a 20 parts per millionemission limit, whichever is less stringent. The CTG further recommends,however, that facilities with existing combustion devices be recognizedas RACT until such a time as the existing device is replaced for otherreasons. This ``grandfathering'' recommendation applies to IMC's formaldehydeplant, which currently employs a catalytic incinerator with an estimated90-95% efficiency. The IMC plant will therefore be allowed to operate withoutmeeting the RACT emission limit until the catalytic incinerator is replaced.This proposed SIP revision consists of the PADER ``plan approval'' applicableto this facility and PADER's permit No. 39-313-014 which together requirethe operation of the incinerator. At the time of replacement, PADER willsubmit a revised operating permit incorporating RACT to EPA for processingas a SIP revision. IMC will be subject to recordkeeping requirements, whichprovide for records to be kept for two years of the gas stream temperature.EPA is soliciting public comments on this notice and on issues relevantto EPA's proposed action. Interested parties may participate in the federalrulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA, RegionIII address above. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>The EPA proposes to approve the submitted ozone SIP revision for air oxidationand high-density resin facilities. As there are only two sources coveredby the two CTG documents in Pennsylvania, and as any new source constructedin Pennsylvania would be covered by new source review requirements, theEPA has determined that incorporating the ARCO and IMC plan approvals andpermits into the Pennsylvania SIP currently constitutes statewide RACTfor sources covered by these two CTGs.Final action on this proposed revision will occur only after all submittedcomments are reviewed.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant ecomonic impact on a substantial number of small entities (See46 FR 8709). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Ozone.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: September 23, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James M.
