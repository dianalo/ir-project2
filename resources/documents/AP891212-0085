BakerIII met today with East Germany's reformist premier, becoming thehighest-ranking U.S. official to visit the Communist nation innearly two decades.   Earlier, Baker celebrated the opening of the Berlin Wall andoutlined ``a new architecture'' for a changing Europe, with alarger role for NATO and closer U.S. ties to the Western militaryalliance.   Baker and East German Premier Hans Modrow met for an hour in theSans Souci room of the Potsdam Hotel.   ``I felt that it was important that we have an opportunity tolet the premier and the people of East Germany know of our supportfor the reforms which are taking place in this country,'' Bakersaid later.   ``We also wanted to make it very clear that we support theprocess of reform in a peaceful manner and that we are very anxiousto see this process move forward in a stable way,'' he said.   Modrow, 61, said East Germany saw Baker's visit ``without adoubt'' as support for reform.   ``This visit is a political sign that the U.S. follows thedevelopments in the DDR (East Germany) with attention,'' Modrowsaid. ``We started a dialogue with each other today.''   Modrow was named premier Nov. 13 of an East Germany in the midstof a stunning upheaval that is sweeping aside orthodox Communism.   It was in Potsdam, southwest of the divided city of Berlin, thatthe United States, the Soviet Union and Britain met in 1945 for aconference to determine Germany's future after the Nazi defeat inWorld War II.   Baker became the first U.S. secretary of state to visit EastGermany since diplomatic relations were established in 1974. Twosecretaries of state, John Foster Dulles in the 1950s and WilliamP. Rogers in the early 1970s, went to East Berlin.   Before driving over the Glienicke Bridge from West Berlin toPotsdam, Baker visited Potsdamer Platz, where a new crossing pointin the Berlin Wall was opened last month.   ``It's pretty impressive,'' he said as he toured the site withWest German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher on a coldlate-autumn day.   Demonstrators nearby protested against U.S. policies in CentralAmerica, shouting ``Yankees out of El Salvador.''   It was not immediately clear how the Baker visit would strikeMoscow, which has become increasingly wary of any signs of possibleGerman reunification and of Western influence on the events in EastGermany.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who met with Baker earlier,and Genscher have both sought to reassure the Soviets that areunified Germany would not pose a security threat to any otherEuropean state.   But Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last weeksharply warned Genscher that reunification could only bring trouble.   Shevardnadze recalled the suffering of the Soviets in the Germaninvasion in World War II and told Genscher that ``propaganda abouta federation of two Germanys can only exacerbate turmoil in thecurrent circumstances.''   The Soviets denounced Kohl's recent 10-point plan for eventualreunification as ``fraught with dangerous consequences andbordering on outright diktat.''   U.S. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Rep. TomLantos, D-Calif., also arranged to see Modrow later in the day.   In a policy speech to the Berlin Press Club, Baker said ``theUnited States and Canada share Europe's neighborhood'' and intendto work with West Europeans to peacefully integrate a reunifiedGermany into a Europe in which East-West tensions are subsiding.   Baker has been pushing for a go-slow approach to Germanreunification, saying the future of the two Germanys should not bedetermined exclusively by the German people.   Baker suggested NATO oversee reductions of troops and armamentsin a treaty being negotiated with the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact andtake new steps to build economic and political ties with the East.   ``As Europe changes, the instruments for Western cooperationmust adapt,'' Baker said in the prepared speech. ``Workingtogether, we must design and gradually put into place anarchitecture for a new era.''   The speech was designed to reassure nervous Western allies asGerman reunification moves closer to reality.   Baker discussed the situation with Kohl at breakfast.   In the speech, Baker said reunification ``must be peaceful, itmust be democratic, it must respect the legitimate concerns of allthe participants in the new Europe.''   A senior U.S. official told reporters the Soviet Union's rights,particularly in administering Berlin as part of an arrangementamong the four World War II Allies, also must be respected.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Bakerwas offering no prescription for similar changes in the WarsawPact. But Gorbachev has also been talking about a new Europe as theold Communist institutions in the East fall away.   Baker urged the 15 U.S. allies in the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization to establish a staff to verify arms control agreementsand to monitor compliance with a treaty Bush and Gorbachev hopewill be completed next year. The superpower leaders are expected toset ceilings of 275,000 U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe and makesharp reductions in tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces.   Also, he said, as the East-West confrontation recedes, NATOshould take on a new mission of helping to resolve regionalconflicts and to stem the proliferation of missiles, chemical andbiological weapons.   Baker said the Western alliance also stands as a model tonations of the East. Over four decades, he said, ``It has offered avision of cooperation, not coercion; of open borders, not ironcurtains.''</TEXT></DOC>
