The report, &quot;A Curriculum of Inclusion,&quot; is the product of a task force appointed by State Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol. It calls for a new &quot;Special Assistant to the Commissioner for Cultural Equity&quot; who, along with a newly created bureaucracy, would &quot;undertake without delay a revision of all curricula and curricular materials so as to ensure that they are compatible with goals of equity and excellence for all cultures within our society.&quot;    We have nothing against diversity; indeed, we want more of it, as our support of more immigration testifies. Learning about different cultures is imperative in this age of disappearing borders, world travel, global telecommunications and economy. But both the above quotations and the humors of the educational elite suggest that a &quot;curriculum of inclusion&quot; is likely to be about much more.    A chat with a spokeswoman for the Education Department offers scant reassurance. Asked whether it was more important for a person living in America to learn about Confucius or Burke and Locke, she says: &quot;You don't have to have an either/or situation, though I would be less racist if I learned about Confucius.&quot; When asked whether she would be more of a racist if she didn't learn about Confucius, she replies: &quot;I think this was what the task force found.&quot; She added: &quot;I do believe what has been taught in this country over the years has been Eurocentric.&quot;    By now, of course, most of us are familiar enough with the assertion that Western Culture is majoritarian, racist and oppressive, and that it therefore should be de-emphasized in education. The saving grace, until now, was that such pedantry was confined to the elite universities. Students at Stanford (SATs above 600: math 86%, verbal 68%) are probably smart enough to recognize nonsense when served it, and are going to do OK in life anyway.    It's quite another thing, though, to inflict the same cultural politicking on the children of New York state. Lay aside the whole question of whether public policy ought to encourage the Puritan Ethic even if Western Culture gave it a name. The simple fact is that there are only so many school hours in the day and so many dollars to spend. If schools spend their resources fretting over the worth of Western culture, it's likely that children will be more woefully unknowledgeable in the basics than they already are. With students being graduated not knowing how to read and write or being able to name the first President of the U.S., it's a travesty that the New York State Education Department is spending its time on, and proposing to create new bureaucracies for, a program of a lesser priority than the three R's. Improving education is much talked about these days, but little is likely to be accomplished until educators stop chasing the latest fad and get back to basics. </TEXT></DOC>
