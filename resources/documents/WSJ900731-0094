Twoyears after the Soviet occupation troops rolled home, the wargoes on. The Soviet puppet ruler Najib still holds sway inKabul, the mujahedeen rebels still are fighting Najib, someof the rebels are fighting each other and Afghan watcherswarn of another Lebanon. Shaping a genuine peace remains oneof the messier tasks facing Secretary of State Baker, whowill tackle the project again later this week in talks withSoviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze.   The two sides are haggling over the terms of a complexpost-peace-accords peace settlement. The U.S. wants Najib tostep down, opening the way for internationally supervised,fair elections. This would give the rebels at least a chanceof sorting out their factional disputes without gunfire. TheSoviets have a fair idea who might win an election, so insistthat Najib preside over an &quot;election.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   What's at stake here goes beyond the borders ofAfghanistan. It's common wisdom by now that smoothing outwrinkles such as Afganistan's war is just one of those oddjobs left over from the Evil Empire days. The assumption, asMr. Baker and President Bush negotiate new arms treaties andconsider Soviet requests for aid, is that the Soviet Unionhas pretty much abandoned its adventures abroad.   But in Asia, where no Communist government has fallen yet,the old Empire's dark side remains on show. There, theSoviets, for all their talk of peace, have done little morethan put their adventures on hold. There has been noreduction in the force of their Pacific fleet, the biggest oftheir four fleets. The Soviets continue to supply theVietnamese army, which still keeps troops in Laos andCambodia.   Though the Soviet army finally was beaten back in 1988 bythe Afghan resistance, the Soviet Union still suppliesNajib's regime with military aid variously estimated at $3 to$5 billion a year. This is more than 10 times what the U.S.supplies to the guerrillas, and more than five times what theguerrillas get from all sources, including Saudi Arabia andAmerica.   Soviet aid since the vaunted 1988 troop pullout hasincluded such hardware as hundreds of tanks, armoredpersonnel carriers and SCUD surface-to-surface missiles.According to the U.S. special envoy to the Afghan resistance,Peter Tomsen, as of April, &quot;Over 1,700 SCUDs have beensupplied since the Soviet pullout; more than 1,400 have beenfired.&quot; The Soviet-backed Afghan secret police, or KHAD,estimated at some 20,000 strong, also protects the regime.   It is preposterous for the Soviet Union to be pouringbillions of dollars of military supplies into Afghanistanwhile pleading with the West for aid. No one should forgetthat it is the Soviet-backed government in Kabul that causedthe deaths of one million Afghans and drove another fivemillion into refugee camps these past 11 years.   Before Mr. Baker resumes haggling with a Soviet governmentthat still does not play fair in Afghanistan, there should beone clear condition. The Soviets must cut their aid toNajib's Communist regime. Only then will there be a chance ofpeace. If the Soviets refuse, the conclusion must be that inAsia at least the Evil Empire still bides its moment.</TEXT></DOC>
