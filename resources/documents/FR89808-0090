(St. Lucie Plant, Units 1 and 2), Exemption</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. </ITAG>Florida Power andamp; Light Company (the licensee) is the holder of FacilityOperating License No. DPR-67, issued March 1, 1976, which authorizes operationof the St. Lucie Plant, Unit 1, and Facility Operating License No. NPF-16,issued April 6, 1983, which authorizes operation of the St. Lucie Plant,Unit 2. These licenses provide, among other things, that the facilitiesare subject to all rules, regulations and orders of the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. The facilitiesare pressurized water reactors located in St. Lucie County, Florida. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. </ITAG>Appendix A of 10 CFR Part 20 defines protection factors for respirators.Footnote d-2(c) of the appendix states, ``No allowance is to be made forthe use of sorbents against radioactive gases or vapors.'' By their submittal dated February 3, 1988, Florida Power andamp; Light Company(FPL) requested an exemption to 10 CFR Part 20, Appendix A, footnote d-2(c).The licensee submitted this request in accordance with 10 CFR Part 20.103(e).The exemption would allow the use of a radioiodine protection factor of50 for Scott Aviation (SCOTT) 631-TEDA-H chin canisters to be used at theSt. Lucie nuclear power plant. Respiratory protection for radioiodine at St. Lucie has normally been providedby use of either an air-supplied or a self-contained breathing apparatus.The use of these appliances is cumbersome and contributes to worker fatigueand lost efficiency. The net result is increased person-rem exposure anda reduction in personnel safety margin. The use of the air-purifying respirators(utilizing the SCOTT 631-TEDA-H canister) can enhance worker comfort andallow greater mobility than the other appliances. FPL estimates that air-purifyingrespirators would enable a 25-50% reduction in the time required to conductcertain tasks requiring respiratory protection. This correlates to a 25-50%reduction in person-rem exposure for these tasks. Criteria and background information used for the evaluation includes 10CFR 20.103; 10 CFR 19.12; Regulatory Guide 8.15, ``Acceptable Programsfor Respiratory Protection''; Regulatory Guide 8.20, ``Applications ofBioassay for I-125 and I-131''; NUREG/CR-3403, ``Criteria and Test Methodsfor Certifying Air-Purifying Respirator Cartridges and Canisters AgainstRadioiodine''; and Regulatory Guide 8.8, ``Information Relevant to EnsuringThat Occupational Radiation Exposures at Nuclear Power Stations Will BeAs Low As Is Reasonably Achievable.'' In addition to the information provided in their February 3, 1988 application,FPL provided additional information on May 5, 1988, June 23, 1988, andMay 4, 1989 in response to staff requests for additional information ina March 16, 1988 letter and in conference calls on October 4, 1988 andMarch 15, 1989. Clarifications of the FPL submittals were obtained in telephonediscussions with FPL representatives on June 2 and June 7, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">III.</ITAG>Since a NIOSH/MSHA testing and certification schedule for sorbents foruse for protection against radioiodine gases and vapors has not been developed,the NRC staff has evaluated the licensee's request and verified, as requiredby 10 CFR 20.103(e), that the licensee has demonstrated by testing, orby reliable test data and adequate quality assurance measures, that thematerial and performance characteristics of the SCOTT 631-TEDA-H canistercan provide the proposed degree of protection (i.e., a protection factorof 50), under the anticipated conditions of use, for a maximum of 8 hours.The main considerations of the staff's technical evaluation were canisterefficiency and service life, including the effects of temperature, poisons,relative humidity, challenge concentration, and breathing rates on canisterefficiency and service life. The staff's programmatic evaluation consideredquality control/quality assurance (QC/QA) measures employed to ensure canisterperformance, and radiation protection/ALARA measures, such as reductionof radioiodine levels using system cleanup, engineering controls, radiologicalsurveillance, and radiological training.The licensee has provided reliable test information which verifies thatthe sorbent canister selected (SCOTT 631-TEDA-H) will provide a protectionfactor of 50 for a period of 8 hours or more of continuous use, providedthat the total challenge concentration of radioactive and non-radioactiveiodine and other halogenated compounds does not exceed 1 ppm, and temperaturedoes not exceed 120anddegrees;F at 100% relative humidity. The data providedby SCOTT shows that use of the 631-TEDA-H canister in saturated air (100%relative humidity) at 120anddegrees;F should provide a nominal 12 hour durationto a 1% methyl iodine penetration.Testing has been conducted under acceptable conditions of pulsed flow,and under worst case conditions for those environmental factors affectingservice life: temperature, relative humidity, and challenge concentrationof CH<T2>3</T2>I (methyl iodine), which is the most penetrating of the challengeforms. SCOTT data provided by the licensee indicates that the 631-TEDA-Hcanisters perform adequately under the accepted test conditions. Theseconditions, the criteria and test methods, are consistent with those recommendedin NUREG/CR-3403 and are acceptable.The licensee has provided commitments that the SCOTT canisters will meetstandards for quality assurance and quality control that are recognizedby NIOSH, compatible with NRC staff positions, and are, therefore, acceptable.This includes a commitment by SCOTT to establish an MIL-STD-414, LevelII, 1% AQL (Acceptable Quality Limit) in a 10 ppm challenge concentrationof CH<T2>3</T2>I, 90% relative humidity, 120anddegrees;F, 64 L/min pulsed flow,for a test duration of 8 hours for maximum penetrations equal to 1% ofthe challenge concentration. Test data provided by the licensee has demonstratedthat performance (i.e., service life) of canisters at 100% relative humidityis acceptable.Coupled with the use of a full facepiece with the capability of providinga minimum fit factor of 500, the protection factor of 50 is conservativeunder these conditions. Canister efficiency will be retained for the radioiodinegas or vapors of interest (CH<T2>3</T2>I, I<T2>2</T2>, HOI) for this time period (i.e., 8 hours). Additionally, thelicensee has provided data which shows the breakthrough point to be wellbeyond 8 hours. To preclude aging, a maximum of 8 hours will be stipulated.This service life will be calculated from the time the canister is unsealed,including periods of non-use.Canisters will be sealed at time of manufacture with an essentially hermeticseal which inhibits water vapor transmission through the seals. The canisterswill be stored in air-conditioned rooms and will be discarded after theuse period of 8 hours or less to prevent reuse. The shelf-life of the canisters,under the conditions of storage at St. Lucie, is estimated by the licenseeto be 3 years.Through usage restrictions, provided by a chemical control program, thelicensee will preclude the unauthorized and indiscriminate use of organicsolvents and chemicals (such as paints, paint solvents, methyl alcohol,ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and acetone) which could cause aging, poisoning,or desorption of the sorbed radioiodines. The chemical controls will notprohibit the use of these organic solvent vapors and chemicals, but theprotection factor will be reduced from a value of 50 to a value of 1 whenthe SCOTT canister is used in their presence. The licensee will modifytheir health physics and respiratory protection procedures regarding theproper use and limitations of SCOTT 631-TEDA-H canisters prior to use forradioiodine protection. FPL will have an active program to recognize chemicalcontaminants that may affect the canister. Relevant helath physics procedureswill be modified to include requirements to evaluate the potential effectsto the canister from work involving chemicals.The 631-TEDA-H canister contains activated carbon impregnated with 5% byweight triethylenediamine (TEDA). This compound has a normal boiling pointof 174anddegrees;C but is known to sublime readily at room temperatures.The volatility of the pure crystals has raised the questions of (1) thevolatility of the TEDA impregnated in activated carbon and (2) the possibletoxicity of TEDA volatilized from a canister and inhaled. Studies havebeen performed on the desorption characteristics of TEDA from impregnatedactivated carbons. It has been found that the desorption vapor concentrationof TEDA is not a function of the linear flow rate or sorbent bed depthwithin the canister. However, the logarithm of the desorption vapor concentrationhas been found to be linearly related to the reciprocal of the absolutetemperature (anddegrees;K). The maximum TEDA desorption vapor concentrationat 48.9anddegrees;C (120anddegrees;F) has been found, by extrapolation frompublished measurements at higher temperatures [G.O. Wood, <T3>Am. Ind. Hyg. Assoc. J. 45</T3> (9):622-625(1984)], to be approximately2 mg/m\3\. There are no toxicological data available for TEDA; however,TEDA belongs to a class of organic aliphatic amines many of which havebeen shown to be toxic. Threshold limit values for similar amines are asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,8,6</C> <H1> </H1><H1>(mg/m\3\)</H1><H1>(ppm)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethylamine<D>18</D><D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Diethylamine<D>30</D><D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Triethylamine<D>40</D><D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethylenediamine<D>25</D><D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Diethylenetriamine<D>4</D><D>1</D></ITAG></ITAG>The 2 mg/m\3\ desorption value at 48.9anddegrees;C is below the lowest thresholdlimit value for similar type substances and therefore the licensee doesnot expect desorbed TEDA to present a toxic hazard to the user.Certain limitations and precautions based on the sorbent canister manufacturer'srecommendations and NUREG/CR-3403 guidance are necessary for effectiveutilization of the sorbent canisters. The staff agrees with the followingsuch limitations and usage restrictions as proposed by the licensee:1. Protection factor equal to 50 as a maximum value.2. Maximum service life of 8 hours (time from unsealing to discarding,including periods of non-exposure).3. Canisters are not to be used in the presence of organic solvent vapors.4. Canisters are to be stored in sealed, humidity barrier packaging inan air-conditioned (office-type) environment.5. Canisters are to be used with a full facepiece respirator for whichthe canister has been certified by NIOSH/MSHA (approval number TC-14G-118).These respirators with 631-TEDA-H canisters are to be capable of providingfit factors greater than 500 for each potential user of the respiratoras determined by fit testing with a challenge atmosphere. FPL will verifythat each individual has, prior to the initial use of the canister, receiveda respirator fitting with the type of full-face respirator to be used withthe canister and has achieved as a minimum a fit factor of 500 (10 timesgreater than the protection factor of 50). The relevant health physicsprocedure will be modified to incorporate the minimum required fit factorof 500 for full-face respirators to be used with the SCOTT 631 TEDA-H canisters.6. Canisters are not to be used in environments where the temperature exceeds120 anddegrees;F.7. Canisters are not to be used in challenge atmosphere concentrationsof total organic iodines and other halogenated compounds (including nonradioactivecompounds) greater than 1.0 ppm.In addition to the limitations and usage restrictions noted above, thelicensee will utilize the following additional administrative and proceduralcontrols:1. Health physics procedures for maximum permissible concentration houraccountability, bioassay, and respiratory protection will be modified toreflect the additional efforts that will be necessary to verify the effectivenessof the SCOTT canister program.2. FPL will perform weekly whole body/thyroid counts for individuals usingthe SCOTT canister for protection against radioiodines. Relevant healthphysics procedures will be modified to reflect the need for whole bodycounting on a weekly basis for those individuals using the canister forprotection from radioiodines. 3. In the initial implementation of SCOTT canister use, the following programverification measures will be used:a. All personnel who exceed 10 maximum permissible concentration (MPC)hours in seven (7) consecutive days will receive a whole body/thyroid countprior to re-entering a radioiodine atmosphere.b. Personnel that have a thyroid burden of 70 nCi or greater as determinedby whole body/thyroid count will be restricted from further exposure toradioiodine atmospheres until the reason for the thyroid burden has beenevaluated by Health Physics and until the individual is authorized by theHealth Physics Department Head to re-enter atmospheres containing radioiodines.c. A database of whole body/thyroid count results and maximum permissibleconcentration hour data will be established to assist in the evaluationof the program's effectiveness.4. The St. Lucie Plant's chemical control program precludes the unauthorizedand indiscriminate use of organic solvents and chemicals. Some organicsolvent vapors of concern to the SCOTT cartridges are paints, paint solvents,methyl alcohol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and acetone. The St. Lucie Plant will establish procedural controls over the use ofthe SCOTT canister in the presence of these chemicals. The controls willnot prohibit the use of the SCOTT canister in the presence of these organicsolvent vapors and chemicals, but the protection factor of the canisterwill be reduced from 50 to 1. FPL will have an active program to recognizechemical contaminants that may affect the canister. Relevant health physicsprocedures will be modified to include requirements to evaluate the potentialeffects to the canister from work involving chemicals.5. A quality control (Q.C.) lot acceptance plan will be employed by SCOTTAviation on each manufacturing lot of 631-TEDA-H canisters produced. Therefore,all canisters consumed by FPL will have been tested per the requirementsof the Q.C. plan.6. MIL-STD-414, level II, AQL 1% will be used to determine the number ofcriteria based on canister performance results. The canister test conditionswill be as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">Air Temperature, % Relative Humidity: 120 anddegrees;F /90% R.H.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Airflow rate conditions: 192 L/min for 0.82 seconds; O L/min for 1.64seconds</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Contaminant/Concentration: CH</ITAG><T2>3</T2> I/10 ppm<ITAG tagnum="15">Test Duration: 8 hours</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Performance Criteria: 1% maximum penetration</ITAG>FPL will accept only those canisters that have been certified by SCOTTas meeting the acceptance criteria of the MIL-STD-414 acceptance plan.FPL will perform a receipt inspection of each shipment of the canistersto verify lot number, expiration data of the canisters and physical integrityof the canisters. SCOTT will be required to provide to FPL the resultsof the acceptance testing for each lot of the canisters that FPL purchasesfrom SCOTT.7. FPL does not plan to reuse the canisters after initial use. All canisterswill be removed after use and discarded to prevent any further use. Thecanisters will not be used when the radionuclide concentrations of radioiodines,particulates or a combination of each exceed 50 times the applicable limitfor the radionuclides in question in 10 CFR Part 20 Appendix B, Table IColumn 1 as described in 10 CFR 20.103(c)(1).8. Existing respiratory protection program requirements and restrictions(e.g., physicals, fit tests, Part 20 requirements, Appendices A and B)still apply. The licensee will modify respiratory protection proceduresto include specific aspects of issue and use of SCOTT canisters.FPL experience has indicated that the use of air-purifying respiratorswith the SCOTT 631-TEDA-H canister can result in significant savings incollective (person-rem) dose to workers. In 1985 the St. Lucie Unit 1 steamgenerator channel heads were shielded to reduce exposure during a nozzledam modification. During mock-up training, time trials were performed usingairline respirators vs. air-purifying respirators with iodine canisters.It took 26 minutes of jump time to install the shielding in one channelhead using airline respirators vs. 18 minutes using air-purifying respirators.This 31% reduction in time would have resulted in a reduction of 2.4 man-rem(300 mrem/min) per channel head and a total of 9.6 man-rem for all fourchannel heads. Nozzle dam installation/removal has been identified as atask where significant man-rem reductions could be realized using air-purifyingrespirators. In 1987, forty-two (42) man-rem were received for this job,whereas 12.6 man-rem would have been avoided if air-purifying respiratorshad been used. In 1984, the Farley Plant provided a task analysis showingthat the use of similar (Mine Safety Appliances Co. Model GMR-1) canistersat Farley would result in significant dose savings and would be an effectiveALARA measure.Reduction of radioiodine levels at St. Lucie is primarily conducted throughsystem cleanup. Shutdown boron concentrations for refueling operationsare reached early in a unit cooldown to create crud burst and allow formaximum cleanup time with the reactor coolant pumps available. To preventradioiodine from remaining in the stagnant loops, the reactor coolant pumpsare run concurrent with shutdown purification operations until the reactorcoolant system iodine levels appear to be stable or decreasing to approximately0.1 mCi/cc. The pressurizer steam space is vented to the volume controltank and the reactor coolant system degasification is accomplished by followingOperating Procedure 1-0030127, entitled ``Reactor Plant Cooldown_Hot Standbyto Cold Shutdown.'' The containment purge system and airborne activityremoval fans are used to reduce radioiodine concentrations in the containmentbuilding. Temporary charcoal filters have also been placed at the inletside of the containment coolers for additional iodine removal. PortableHEPA units (negative pressure ventilation blowers) are used at the steamgenerator manway openings and the reactor head during and after the breachof the reactor coolant system. Decontamination of work areas is accomplishedthroughout an outage. Previous major system decontamination efforts includethe steam generator channel head and the refueling pool cavities. If practical,time is allowed for contamination reduction by decay; however, the mainemphasis is on system and area cleanup. During normal operation, attemptsare made to minimize power transients in order to reduce radioiodine levels.Long-term efforts include QA/QC programs for fuel quality. Also, the benefitsof the fuel reconstitution process are being evaluated by FPL for considerationin subsequent refueling outages. With respect to fuel design improvement,several areas are being evaluated and/or implemented in order to reducethe fretting of fuel pins, therefore reducing the likelihood of fuel pinfailures. Additionally, following outages of certain duration, slow powerramp rates are used to precondition the fuel which could result in a lowerincidence of fuel failure.The licensee has developed and is implementing an ALARA program consistentwith the staff's position in Regulatory Guide 8.8 and the licensee's effortsto keep radiation exposures ALARA are acceptable to the staff. In summary, the licensee is required to use process or other engineeringcontrols, to the extent practicable, to limit concentrations of radioactivematerials in air to levels below those which delimit an airborne radioactivityarea as defined in 10 CFR 20.203(d)(1)(ii). When it is impracticable toapply process or other engineering controls to achieve these concentrationsof radioactive material in air, the licensee is required to use other precautionaryprocedures, such as increased surveillance, limitation of working times,or provision of respiratory protective equipment to maintain worker intakeof radioactive material as far below the limits of 10 CFR Part 20 as isreasonably achievable. The licensee has been providing respiratory protectionfor radioiodine by use of air-supplied or self-contained breathing apparatus.However, the use of these apparatuses is cumbersome and contributes toworker fatigue and lost efficiency. The net result is increased exposureof workers to radiation (increased person-rem). The use of air-purifyingrespirators can enhance worker comfort and allow greater mobility thanthe air-supplied or self-contained breathing apparatus. However, 10 CFRPart 20, Appendix A, Footnote d-2(c) stipulates that no allowance is tobe made for the use of sorbents against radioactive gases or vapors inassigning protection factors for respirators. Also, 10 CFR 20.103(e) providesthat where equipment of a particular type has not been tested and certified,or had certification extended by NIOSH/MSHA, or where there is no existingschedule for test and certification of certain equipment, the licenseeshall not make allowance for this equipment without specific authorizationby the Commission. An application for this authorization must include ademonstration by testing, or on the basis of reliable test information,that the material and performance characteristics of the equipment arecapable of providing the proposed degree of protection under anticipatedconditions of use.Therefore, the licensee has applied for an exemption, in accordance withthe provisions of 10 CFR 20.103(e), to allow the use of a radioiodine protectionfactor in estimating worker exposure from radioiodine gases and vaporswhen an air-purifying respirator with a sorbent canister is used to providethis protection. The staff's review of the licensee's proposal indicatesthat the actions proposed by the licensee can result in significant dosesavings over alternative methods while still providing effective protection.The licensee has provided usage restrictions and controls which can assurean effective radioiodine protection program. The proposed criteria andtest methods for verifying the effectiveness and quality of SCOTT 631-TEDA-Hcanisters are consistent with the staff's criteria. The licensee's proposedexemption, with the controls and limitations, is consistent with the staff'sposition in granting similar exemptions, is consistent with the qualificationprocess recommended in NUREG/CR-3403, is consistent with the staff's positionin Regulatory Guide 8.8, and is acceptable.The actions proposed by the licensee are consistent with the requirementsof 10 CFR Part 20.103(e), and form an acceptable basis to authorize thegranting of an exemption in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR Part20.103(e).<ITAG tagnum="84">IV</ITAG>Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 20.501,an exemption is authorized by law and will not result in undue hazard tolife and property. The Commission hereby grants an exemption from the requirementsof footnote d-2(c) of Appendix A of 10 CFR Part 20 to permit the use ofScott Aviation 631-TEDA-H canisters at the St. Lucie Plant, Units 1 and2.Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting thisexemption will have no significant effect on the quality of the human environment(54 FR 31902, August 2, 1989).For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's requestdated February 3, 1988, as supplemented by letters dated May 5, 1988, June23, 1988, and May 4, 1989, which are available for public inspection atthe Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC,and at the Indian River Junior College Library, 3209 Virginia Avenue, FortPierce, Florida 33450. <ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Steven A.
