(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Anti-nuclear activists say weekend proteststhat resulted in about 475 arrests show that their 13-year-oldfight against the stalled Seabrook nuclear power plant remainsspirited.   ``I'm thrilled with the way things have gone,'' Dianne Dunfey ofthe anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance said Sunday as about 200protesters rallied at the Statehouse. ``They (Seabrook proponents)thought we'd go away a long time ago.''   On Saturday, Dunfey and the others scaled fences surrounding theseacoast plant and were arrested for trespassing.   Today, a small group of activists planned a sit-in at Gov. JuddGregg's outer office until he meets with them to discuss Seabrook.   The protests were part of a week of anti-Seabrook eventsscheduled to culminate with a rally near President Bush's vacationhome in Kennebunkport, Maine.   Seabrook was finished in 1986 and conducted low-power atomictests this summer, but the $6.2 billion reactor still lacks acommercial license because of challenges to evacuation plans fornearby beaches and communities in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.   Anti-Seabrook demonstrations since 1976 have resulted in morethan 3,600 arrests and made the plant a symbol of the nation'santi-nuclear movement.   ``The fight is far from over. And, in many ways, the fight hasjust started,'' said Massachusetts state Sen. Nicholas Costello,one of Sunday's speakers.   But the police chief in the town of Seabrook, Paul Cronin, saidhe is considering a new weapon against Clamshell organizers _ thefederal Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act.   Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a decision in which anabortion clinic used RICO to win damages from an anti-abortiongroup in Philadelphia. Cronin said he wants to determine whether hecan use the law against Clamshell leaders.   The chief said Seabrook opponents have a right to climb over theplant's fences to be arrested, but not to incite others to followthem.   ``They rouse up those people and brought them to the town withthe express idea of breaking the law,'' Cronin said.   Roy Morrison, one of four Clamshell leaders identified astargets for possible harsher treatment, countered: ``Theauthorities are willing to destroy the basic fabric that protectsfreedom in this country _ freedom of citizens to speak, associateand take action.''</TEXT></DOC>
