(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three Western governors at odds withWashington over disposal of nuclear waste in their states stoodtheir ground despite assurances from Energy Secretary James Watkinsthat the government is serious about safety.   Gov. Garrey Carruthers said New Mexico won't accept anyradioactive waste until the Energy Department meets all commitmentsto the state; Gov. Cecil Andrus said Idaho won't take any moreshipments after August, and Colorado Gov. Roy Romer said he willshut down the Rocky Flats weapons plant when it reaches its storagecapacity.   During a meeting with the governors on Wednesday, the secretarysaid the plutonium-waste storage facility built a third of a mileunderground near here won't open until the government shows it cansafely transport and bury nuclear waste.   The department's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant is designed forpermanent storage of radioactive waste created by military projects.The waste would be kept 2,150 feet below ground in ancient salt beds26 miles southeast of here.   ``We will open WIPP, but we will open it when it's ready,''Watkins said.   The WIPP was supposed to open last October, but questions aboutthe long-term safety of the salt beds and how waste is to betransported to it have delayed the opening. Watkins has said heexpects to open the plant next year but has not given a target date.   With Rocky Flats expected to run out of storage space by earlynext year _ and the three Western governors standing firm _ thegovernment could find itself without a place to store nuclear waste,a stalemate that federal officials said could endanger maintenanceof the nation's nuclear arsenal.   ``The president asked me to come into this job to clean up themess dealing with the production reactors, the waste facilities, sothis nation can stand tall again on the peace-through-strengthconcept, which WIPP is all about,'' Watkins said.   Watkins said he couldn't speculate on where waste would be storedif Rocky Flats became filled. But he said it is unlikely Idaho,Colorado or New Mexico would be used for any type of interim storagefacility.   After the meeting, the governors said they were pleased withWatkins' take-charge attitude.   ``There is a new breeze blowing across Eddy County and across theUnited States with respect to the Department of Energy,'' Carrutherssaid. ``I like the fact the secretary has committed to us that hewill operate at his pace _ a pace that he determines is safe.''   But none of the governors was willing to budge on accepting morewaste.   Andrus said Idaho, as planned, will accept four boxcars of wastefrom Rocky Flats in August and then close its border. ``Idaho'sposition is not going to change,'' he said.   Romer said Rocky Flats may not expand its storage capacity _``and when we reach the limit, we will close Rocky Flats.''   Carruthers said, ``The state of New Mexico believes WIPP is notyet ready to accept waste, and we will resist all efforts to openuntil such time as DOE commitments to New Mexico are met.'' Thosecommitments include compensation for road improvements andassurances on safety and environmental protection.</TEXT></DOC>
