Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the NationalRepublican Senatorial Committee and an influential party strategist, waspredicting not only a presidential victory in 1992 but sweeping Republicangains in Congress as well.;    'Bigger than 1984';  &quot;I think it could bebigger than 1984; I think it could be 1980 all over again,&quot; he said Tuesday,referring to the 1980 election in which the Republicans won both the WhiteHouse and control of the Senate.;    But a year is a lifetime in politics, asRuvolo and other politicians stress.;    And even the most bullish Republicanscast a nervous eye on the economy.;    Bush has repeatedly stumbled ondomestic issues, notably during last fall's negotiations on the federalbudget, and Democrats are eager to return the debate to matters close tohome.;    &quot;I continue to believe that the fact that the war appears to beending quickly and decisively helps us get back to a domestic agenda,&quot; saidRonald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.;    &quot;Andgetting back to a domestic agenda is helpful to Democrats.&quot;;    Still, thiswar has transformed Bush.;    Battled the 'wimp factor'; The man who spentmuch of the 1988 campaign fighting what his critics gleefully called the &quot;wimpfactor,&quot; the man assailed by conservatives just a few months ago for hishandling of the budget negotiations now finds himself lionized for hisstrength -- in many of the same quarters.;    His approval ratings -- in thehigh 80s -- match those of President Harry S. Truman in June 1945, just afterthe unconditional surrender of Germany.;    No one really expects these pollratings to last. But when it comes to the threshold question of presidentialcampaigns -- is this candidate a credible commander in chief? -- analysts inboth parties believe that voters are certain to remember the Persian Gulf.;   And the Democrats, whose presidential candidates are likely to be members ofCongress or governors and who have been shut out of the White House for 10years, will have a far greater challenge in answering that question.;    Theparty that flinched;  The war could also leave its imprint on the images ofboth parties. Some Republicans suggest, and some Democrats fear, that Bush hasset the stage for a re-election campaign that draws a stark and brutalcontrast between a party willing to use American force to counter aggressionand a party that flinched.;    &quot;Saddam Hussein is really becoming his WillieHorton for 1992,&quot; said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic poll taker, referring tothe convicted murderer given a weekend furlough during the Dukakisadministration whose case was used by Bush to depict Michael Dukakis as softon crime.;    &quot;It can become a way to shape the whole campaign.&quot;;   Republican strategists assert, and clearly plan to argue in the next campaign,that the overwhelming vote by congressional Democrats against the use of forcein the gulf is only part of a devastating pattern.;    Rep. Newt Gingrich ofGeorgia, the House Republican whip and another party strategist, casts thegulf war as the decisive moment of a decade of debate.;    Democrats' nextmove;  &quot;What you've had is Republicans saying for 10 years that force matters,strength matters, technology works and Democrats saying, 'No, you're wrong,' &quot;Gingrich said.;    Democrats, however, quickly rallied around the presidentafter the congressional debate ended and the war began.;    They are alreadyarmed with research that casts their party as critical to the development ofmany of the weapons that have proven so successful in the Persian Gulf.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ROBIN TONER, New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910227  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  711  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 27, 199100058139,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
