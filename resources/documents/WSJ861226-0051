Paulo Roberto Cardoso, who has mastered enough English to convey the reaction between his stomach and boiled serpent, &quot;is so worse.&quot;    Eating snakes is part of the training at what is probably the world's meanest school of jungle warfare. The Brazilian army's Centro de Instrucao de Guerra na Selva, or CIGS, believes in putting its officer students through hell.    At this small base on a tributary of the Amazon, the effects of this treatment on 32 officers are clear: They look gaunt, dazed -- and slim.    Stripped of names -- they are referred to by the numbers on their hats -- these men have been pushed to the brink. Already, eight of the 40 who began the course have been eliminated.    They've been harangued and ridiculed, deprived of sleep, teased by booby traps and made to eat squirming larva. They've killed poisonous snakes with their hands. Now, a week from the end of the course, &quot;it's a fight against your own mind,&quot; says Lt. Emmanuel Du Mesnil, a Frenchman who is one of three foreigners in the course.    Such humiliation, applied in near 100% humidity, is one way CIGS tries to simulate the brutality of war. It's modeled on the U.S. Army's school in Panama -- the Jungle Operations Training Center.    But although exchanges between the schools continue, CIGS has developed a longer and tougher course. Just 1,500 soldiers have graduated from CIGS in 22 years, while its U.S. counterpart trains 10,000 American troops a year.    &quot;Our training is three weeks, whereas the Brazilian is nine, and we are not as survival-oriented,&quot; says William Ormsbee, a spokesman at U.S. Southern Command in Panama. Asked what being less &quot;survival-oriented&quot; means, he replies that &quot;we sure don't eat monkey.&quot; Instead, soldiers going into the Panamanian jungle are supplied with packages of dried food called Meals Ready to Eat.    Because the Amazon region covers 45% of Brazil -- a country bigger than the 48 contiguous states of the U.S. -- Brazil considers expertise in these hostile conditions to be of great importance. Indeed, with oil, gold and manganese being discovered in the jungle, Amazon security is a growing priority.    Just last month, the government announced a project under which six new military posts will be established along a 4,000-mile jungle stretch bordering Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana and Suriname. Officials said this $13 million project wasn't prompted by border problems.    But instability in Suriname, the spread of Colombian drug trafficking, contraband in gold and other valuables, perennial tensions on the Venezuela-Guyana border and the potential establishment of leftist bases in the jungle are among possible threats CIGS troops are being trained to meet.    Alexandre Barros, a leading military analyst, says: &quot;Before, the jungle was a buffer. But, with economic settlements, the buffer has become a little thinner.&quot;    The trainees are too exhausted to dabble in Amazonian strategy. They have been told there will be another all-night operation. One, Carlos Alberto Passarella, looks pained as he describes how he and six others survived for five days on three small fish: &quot;We couldn't find any monkey,&quot; he sighs.    Capt. Antonio Carlos Krieger outlines the exercise. A guerrilla movement has emerged in the jungle. It has been fighting on the side of peasants against big landowners and trying to force a secession of part of Amazonia. Tonight's mission will be to find a group of eight terrorists and eliminate them.    The mission is typical of assignments given in the latter part of the course, after survival and technical training. Although the fictitious guerrilla groups are generally leftist, blunt references to communists with Russian-sounding names have been dropped.    After midnight, the men board four launches and chug out into the deep blackness of the Amazon night. The jungle chatters and squawks. There are fireflies and shooting stars, and the launches flash signals at each other across the inky water.    They land and begin to advance -- at a speed of about one yard a minute. Moving through Amazon jungle at night is rather like trying to find your way out of your worst nightmare: Trees have clusters of thorns, huge leaves stick clammily to your cheeks and a mass of shoots and branches ensnares your legs. Visibility is about 18 inches, and most sounds seem to resemble the rustling of a sharp-toothed jaguar.    The confusion is immense, and the commander, 08, seems panicked. After much toing and froing, an ambush is set for the guerrillas -- played by soldiers from the Brazilian army. At dawn, there is a sudden confused exchange of fire (blanks only), and the CIGS forces flee.    Asked if the guerrillas were eliminated, Captain Krieger looks angry. &quot;No,&quot; he says testily, &quot;08 was eliminated.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
