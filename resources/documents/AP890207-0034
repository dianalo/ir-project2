The commission's job is to recommend to the president every fouryears the appropriate pay levels for members of the House andSenate, federal judges, the president and vice president, and thetop layers of executive-branch workers.   Three members of the panel are appointed by the president, two bythe president of the Senate, two by the speaker of the House and twoby the chief justice. Their recommendations could be accepted,rejected or modified by the president, who then includes his finalrecommendations in the budget he submits to Congress.   Under the procedure, unless both the House and Senate vote tohead them off, the recommended raises become law 30 days after thepresident proposes them.   This year's recommendations for a 51 percent pay raise formembers of Congress, and similar increases for other top federalworkers, came from a commission chaired by Lloyd Cutler, aWashington attorney and former White House counsel to PresidentCarter.   Cutler was appointed to the panel by President Reagan, along withformer postmaster general Preston R. Tisch and William Agee,president of Morrison, Knudsen Corp.   The president of the Senate _ then-vice president George Bush _appointed former Sens. Thomas F. Eagleton, D-Mo., and Charles McC.Mathias, R-Md., to the panel.
