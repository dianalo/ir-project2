But at the annual economic summit here, leaders of theU.S., Japan, West Germany, Italy, Britain, France, Canada andthe European Community weren't able to break the deadlock onagricultural subsidies in current international trade talks.President Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroneyrejected a compromise proposed by British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher yesterday morning, U.S. and Britishofficials said.</LP><TEXT>   Later in the day, Mr. Bush presented a U.S. compromiseproposal on agriculture based on a recent paper by Aart deZeeuw, chairman of the agricultural negotiating committee atthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, according to U.S.Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.   The paper was intended to serve as a catalyst for the GATTtalks in Geneva. The negotiations pit major food-exportingcountries such as the U.S., which favor the eventualelimination of farm subsidies, against the EC, which arguesthat such subsidies are needed to maintain Europe's socialfabric.   Mr. de Zeeuw proposed dividing agricultural subsidies intofour categories: domestic supports such as direct payments tofarmers; measures applied at borders, such as import quotasand tariffs; export subsidies; and health and sanitaryrequirements imposed on importers.   Mr. de Zeeuw recommended that trading nations agree to puta ceiling on internal supports, according to officialsfamiliar with the text of his plan. He would convert allborder measures to tariffs. Export subsidies would be reducedquickly and eventually eliminated. And nations would adopt acode to assure that health regulations aren't used torestrict trade.   &quot;In my opinion, we'll either have some appropriatereference to the {GATT proposal} or we'll agree to disagree,&quot;Mr. Yeutter said of the summit. &quot;It's too late to paper overour differences,&quot; the agriculture secretary said. &quot;Thepresident understands that, and he's communicated that to hisnegotiating colleagues.&quot;   Staff members were preparing to work through the night inhopes of reaching an agreement by the time the summitconcludes today.   The summit's political communique, published yesterday,masked the tensions on trade and focused instead on theincreasing acceptance of market-oriented democracy throughoutthe world. The 1990s should be &quot;a decade of democracy,&quot; thecommunique said, welcoming recent moves toward democracy inEastern Europe and Latin America. President Bush and theother summit leaders also gave a qualified endorsement to themore tentative political and economic changes in the SovietUnion and South Africa.   In that context, the summit nations agreed yesterday toproceed with a study of the Soviet economy and itsrequirements. The study would be conducted by theInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development and the new EuropeanBank for Reconstruction and Development, Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady told reporters.   The study is a compromise between the U.S. and the EC,which recently commissioned a separate study. That would haveexcluded the U.S., Canada and Japan. The new study will drawon the much greater resources of the IMF and World Bank,which are dominated by the U.S., and American officialsbelieve these organizations will do a more rigorous analysisof Soviet needs.   The Soviets also could soon have better access to U.S.financial markets, which has been blocked under U.S. lawsthat prohibit debtors in default from returning to Americanfinancial markets. The Soviet Union, struggling to modernizeits economy, is willing to negotiate its debts outstanding,while the U.S. is prepared to help the Soviets gain access tofinancial markets.   The Soviet Union has substantial debts to the U.S.unsettled from earlier eras. These include $300 million inborrowings by the Czarist government and the provisionalKerensky government prior to the Bolshevik revolution of1917. The sum owed would amount to many billions of dollarsif accrued interest is taken into account. The Soviets alsoowe the U.S. about $700 million for military hardware andother war-related aid provided during World War II.   &quot;We'll have to find a way to resolve it somewhere short oftheir claim and our claim,&quot; said Secretary of State JamesBaker. &quot;It's a negotiation under way.&quot; Besides beingineligible for commercial bank credit from the U.S., theSoviets can't receive loans backed by U.S. governmentguarantees because of the disputed loans.   The Soviet Union and its floundering economy haveattracted much of the attention at this summit. PresidentMikhail Gorbachev wrote to President Bush before thegathering asking for economic aid and technical assistance.The U.S. so far has extended only limited technicalassistance to the Soviets.   Asked whether the U.S. would advance economic aid to theSoviets, Mr. Baker said, &quot;I don't think you should ever saynever.&quot; But he added, &quot;There are, as I think we articulated,particular problems that face the United States today inusing taxpayer dollars to provide economic assistance to theSoviet Union.&quot; The U.S. approach could change if the SovietUnion makes a fundamental effort &quot;toward free-market reform,&quot;reduces the scope of military spending and cuts aid togovernments such as Cuba, which he said, &quot;supportinstability.&quot;   In their political communique, the summit leaders affirmedthey would help countries that choose freedom, and they saidpolitical and economic freedoms are &quot;closely linked andmutually reinforcing.&quot; They said Europe is &quot;at the dawn of anew era&quot; because of changes in Eastern Europe and theunification of Germany, but added that the industrialcountries shouldn't neglect reforms elsewhere, including suchcountries as Nepal, Namibia and Chile.   The communique said sanctions should remain on Chinabecause of the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators inBeijing. But it acknowledged some &quot;recent developments&quot;there. The summit also offered the prospect of some expansionin World Bank lending to China, particularly to addressenvironmental concerns.   The language on China was designed to finesse differencesbetween Japan and the other summit nations. Unlike itspartners at the summit, Japan favors resuming lending toChina and soon will restart a $5 billion loan held up sincethe Beijing killings in June 1989.   The summit group congratulated Namibia and Chile on theirdemocracies, and urged Cuba and Romania to do more to fosterdemocracy. It also sounded a cautionary note on the surge ofethnic and religious violence, saying &quot;such intolerance canlead to conflicts, which can threaten fundamental humanrights.&quot;   On South Africa, the summit leaders said they hope for &quot;apeaceful transition to a non-racial democracy and thecomplete dismantlement of the apartheid system.&quot; The groupcalled on all parties to &quot;refrain from violence or itsadvocacy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
