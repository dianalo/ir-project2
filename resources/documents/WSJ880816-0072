The McAllen-Edinburg-Mission area ranks as the poorest metropolitan area in America. Per-capita personal income in 1986 was $6,800, just 46% of the national average.    And the gap between McAllen and the richest metropolitan areas is growing. The highest personal income per capita is along the Connecticut &quot;Gold Coast,&quot; Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury. There, per-capita income in 1986 was $24,501, or 167% of the national average. Between 1984 and 1986, income grew by more than $3,000 in the Bridgeport area, while in the McAllen area, it rose a mere $400.    According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which tracks per-capita personal income, the richest metropolitan areas tend to be on the East or West coasts and draw a disproportionate share of income from dividend, interest and rental income, as well as from earnings.    North of the Border   Is Emigrants' Goal   GIVEN HIS South Texas origins, it may be unusual that Senator Bentsen is so well off, but it's no surprise that he speaks fluent Spanish. The McAllen area has one of the highest proportions of Hispanic residents of the nation's 323 metropolitan areas. In McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, 88% of the population is of Spanish origin, according to estimates by Sales andamp; Marketing Management's 1988 Survey of Buying Power. That is second only to nearby Laredo, where 97% of the population is of Spanish origin.    Fueling the Hispanic population of border cities like McAllen is continuing high immigration from Mexico. Since the 1960s, Mexico has been the No. 1 country in terms of sending immigrants to the U.S. Since 1980, the total immigration pie has been growing, and Mexico accounts for a growing slice. In 1987, legal immigration from all countries topped 600,000, equal to the record set in 1986. By contrast, the U.S. admitted 531,000 immigrants in 1980.    Last year Mexico sent 72,000 immigrants, representing 12% of all legal immigrants. In 1980, the 57,000 immigrants from Mexico were 11% of the total. These figures, however, underestimate actual Mexican immigration by as much as 50%. A majority of net illegal immigration, estimated by the Census Bureau at 160,000 in 1986, comes from Mexico.    Births to Hispanics Are   Increasing in the U.S.    IMMIGRATION isn't the only reason the Mexican-American population is growing. Hispanic births are also on the rise, and two-thirds are to mothers of Mexican origin. Only 23 states and the District of Columbia report on births to Hispanics, but together these areas account for 92% of the Hispanic population. The National Center for Health Statistics, which compiles these reports, found an 11% increase in the number of births to Hispanics between 1983 and 1985. During the same period, the birth rate among non-Hispanic women was up just 3%. Hispanic births accounted for 17% of all births in 1985, the most recent year data are available.    Forty percent of Hispanic births were in California and 25% in Texas. By comparison with non-Hispanics, Hispanic mothers are, on average, younger (16% in their teens, compared with 10% of white, non-Hispanic mothers) and less educated (56% of Hispanic mothers have completed high school vs. 84% of white, non-Hispanic mothers).    More Than Mexicans   Are Into Enchiladas   MEXICAN-Americans love Mexican food, but so do non-Hispanics. According to the market research firm Packaged Facts, 38 million Americans now enjoy enchiladas and nosh on nachos. As a result, the Mexican prepared-food market tallied $1.4 billion in retail sales in 1987. And that doesn't include corn and tortilla chips, now assimilated into the general snack-food category.    The outlook for prepared Mexican foods looks rosy since the most likely consumers are in demographic groups that are growing at above-average rates: women aged 35 to 44, households with children 12 to 17 years old, and those with incomes of $60,000 or more. Households headed by someone aged 35 to 44 will grow by 23% between 1988 and 2000, compared with overall household growth of 13%. The number of teen-agers 12 to 17 years old will rise 16% by 2000, and the number of households with incomes of $60,000-plus will more than double.    Sales of frozen Mexican entrees, combining Mexican zest with North American convenience, grew 31% in 1987. The combination apparently is even more potent when it taps into the national preoccupation with dieting. Weight Watchers was the brand leader in sales growth last year, and its share of the frozen Mexican entree category jumped to 17% from 4%. </TEXT></DOC>
