Scientists say upright hominids evolved atleast 3.7 million years ago; modern humans may have first appeared about100,000 years ago.  </MEMO><TEXT>  A &quot;The answer to the question is we don't know and we'll never know, becauseit's hidden in the mysteries of evolution,&quot; says Samuel Jay Keyser, a linguistat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Human beings have been aroundfor 500 million years, developing and using language for much of that time,but our first written records of language dates back only about 5,000 years,Keyser says.;    Still, the question is so fascinating that it's impossiblefor scholars to keep from speculating. Keyser favors a line of reasoning heattributes to Harvard biologist Stephen Jay Gould.;    &quot;Language may well be aspandrel of the mind,&quot; Keyser says, using an architectural term for the spacebetween two arches when one arch is inside the other. The first builders whosupported domes with arches created spandrels by accident, and at firstbuilders paid no attention to spandrels and decorated only the arches, Keysersays. But after a couple of centuries, builders began focusing on anddecorating the spandrels.;    In the same way, Keyser says language may havebeen a thinking and communicating &quot;spandrel&quot; accidentally created by thedevelopment of some cultural &quot;arch&quot;:;    Before they could talk, people wereprobably making animal- like sounds to give warnings, to indicate the nearnessof food and to relay other important messages. Keyser says these sounds mayhave begun to take on the infinite flexibility of true language when somecomplex new project or cultural development stimulated people to start talkingabout it.;    We don't know what this project or &quot;arch&quot; was -- maybe religion,art, or tracking the stars. But after a while, this theory goes, people beganto focus on the talking and to apply to all aspects of life their new abilityto invent and understand combinations of words they had never heard before.And pretty soon they were telling jokes and stories and asking questions aboutthe origins of language.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Boston Globe  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910813  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  375  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, August 13, 199100226081,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
