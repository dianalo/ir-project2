(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first of the Air Force'spowerful new $150 million Titan 4 space rockets was transported toa launch pad Saturday under curious censorship.   The 20-story-tall rocket, the largest unmanned booster in theU.S. space stable, is scheduled to make its maiden flight nextOctober, boosting a classified military reconnaissance satellite.   Development of the Titan 4 was accelerated following theexplosion that destroyed space shuttle Challenger in 1986. Thegrounding of the shuttle fleet left several critical nationalsecurity payloads without a way to get into space, and many ofthose will be hoisted by the new rocket.   The Air Force, which held a media extravaganza here in Januarywhen the first rocket was delivered and its launch pad wasdedicated, originally said the news media would be escorted to thepad to cover Saturday's rollout.   But Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldrich, who presided at theJanuary festivity, ruled the media out earlier this week, with thePentagon explaining only that, ``the launch sequence of militarylaunch vehicles is not typically an item of public discussion.''   But when the decision was made Saturday to move the Titan 4, AirForce public affairs officials alerted the news media at theirhomes by phone. They also made arrangements to release photographs,film and videotape of the move.   Air Force Lt. Col. Ron Rand, director of public affairs at theEastern Space and Missile Center, replied, ``absolutely none,''when asked if there were any security or safety reasons for barringthe press Saturday.   A Titan 34D, predecessor of the Titan 4, is being readied on anadjacent pad for a secret military launching, but Rand said thathad no bearing on the ruling.   The rocket was visible for miles during its 45-minute move tothe launch pad from an assembly building. The closest point for thepublic to see it was about six miles away.   The launch pad debuts of previous space rockets have been opento news coverage here.   Martin Marietta is building 23 Titan 4s for the Air Force at itsplant near Denver. The Pentagon is seeking millions in public fundsto build an additional 27 boosters.   Col. Lawrence Gooch, commander of the Eastern Space and MissileCenter, issued a statement saying, ``The rollout of the Titan 4 isanother major step toward recovering our space launch capability.''   From Washington, Aldrich said, ``The Titan 4 program is one ofthe cornerstones of our national security stategy to rebuildassured access to space. This booster represents the new workhorseof space for our nation.''   For the next several months, a team of specialists from the AirForce and Martin Marietta Astronautics Group will check thecompatibility of the rocket with the new launch pad and prepare thevehicle for launch.   The Air Force plans to launch two Titan 4 rockets a year fromCape Canaveral to boost military satellites for such assignments asreconnaissance, communications and communications intercept. Otherlaunches are scheduled from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.   The Titan 4 can boost 32,000-pound payloads into low Earth orbitand 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit 22,300 miles high, where mostmilitary satellites are based.</TEXT></DOC>
