SansweetStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WIX </IN><DATELINE> SANTA MONICA, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>    Wickes Cos. said one of itsdivisions has produced and sold for a decade about $360million of commercial-grade, polyvinyl chloride-backedcarpeting that didn't meet some flammability tests specifiedby local building codes or standards of customers, includingthe federal government.   Wickes stressed that, in its view, the carpeting is safe. The retailer and manufacturer said the carpet has been sold without any known incident of fire-related injuries.    Because the problem only recently came to the attention of Wickes's management, the company said it isn't able to quantify the costs that may be incurred in resolving the problem, but expects that it is likely to be &quot;a material amount.&quot;    Wickes said its auditor, Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., has indicated it will qualify its opinion on Wickes's financial statement for the year ended Jan. 31, 1987. The opinion will be subject to the resolution of the carpet problem, Wickes said.    Wickes, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings a little more than two years ago, recently reported that net income for fiscal 1987 rose to $83.8 million, or 33 cents a share, from the year-earlier $76.1 million, or 47 cents on fewer shares. Sales rose to $4.77 billion from $2.81 billion.    The carpet, sold almost entirely to commercial and institutional customers, was made in a Dalton, Ga., plant of the Floor Coverings division of Collins andamp; Aikman Corp. Collins andamp; Aikman was acquired by Wickes in January for $1.16 billion.    In response to questions, a Wickes spokesman said last night that the company is in the process of terminating some Collins andamp; Aikman employees as a result of the problem, and is continuing its investigation. He wasn't more specific.    &quot;This was brought to our attention within the last week by Collins andamp; Aikman corporate management,&quot; the spokesman added. Wickes retained Collins andamp; Aikman management following the acquisition.    Wickes said that over the past 10 years the Floor Coverings unit sold more than 30 million square yards of the carpeting. It said that it believes the carpet, sold in rolls and as carpet &quot;tiles,&quot; complies with the requirements imposed by the federal Flammable Fabrics Act, but didn't meet stiffer radiant panel flammability tests specified by some local building codes or by some customers such as U.S. government agencies and offices. The tests determine the susceptibility of fabric to flame. The carpet also didn't meet some local or customer smoke density standards, which set levels for the amount of smoke that fabric can give off.    The company said the problem doesn't involve broadloom or any other types of carpeting products. And based on normal commercial carpet replacement, it is possible that only about half of the 30 million square yards sold is still in place. Analysts believe the entire Floor Coverings unit contributes less than 10% of the $1 billion annual sales of the Collins andamp; Aikman unit, and a smaller percentage of profits. Collins andamp; Aikman also makes specialty textile products and wall coverings.    After discussions with outside consultants, Wickes said it doesn't believe the carpeting poses safety risks. However, the company has at least temporarily ceased all shipments of PVC-backed carpeting pending further testing and analysis.    The company has also started notifying all appropriate regulatory agencies. Wickes said it also intends to notify customers and assure them &quot;that Collins andamp; Aikman will work with them to resolve any questions or difficulties that may arise.&quot;    The Wickes spokesman said there haven't been any lawsuits filed relating to the problem. </TEXT></DOC>
