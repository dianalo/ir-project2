The collapse of Territory Savings, which had assets of $37.8 million, will cost the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures deposits, an estimated $52 million. The thrift's sole office will reopen today as a branch of Omaha, Neb.-based Commercial Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, a spokeswoman for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said.    Territory's troubles were compounded by significant losses on high-risk loans and the economic misfortunes of Oklahoma's oil and gas industry. On Nov. 30, Territory reported a negative net worth, or assets minus liabilities, of $40.6 million. Commercial Federal, which has 67 offices in Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado, paid the FSLIC $4.4 million to acquire Territory's insured deposits.    In Salem, Ore., the Bank Board closed Citizens Savings andamp; Loan Association and transferred the insolvent thrift's insured deposits to Freedom Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association in Corvallis, Ore.    The thrift's 11 offices will reopen as branches of Freedom, a thrift created by the Bank Board in 1985 to take over the deposits of another insolvent Oregon thrift, State Savings andamp; Loan Association. The FSLIC will provide Freedom with $35 million in cash and a $100 million note to cover the transferred deposits.    Meanwhile in Florida, Gerald Lewis, the state comptroller, closed Trust Bank in Hialeah, Fla., in the nation's 16th bank failure this year. The failed bank's four offices will reopen today as branches of Republican National Bank of Miami.    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., acting as Trust Bank's receiver, decided to transfer its deposits, totaling $159.6 million, to Republican after being unable to determine the exact value of the failed bank's assets and contingent liabilities. </TEXT></DOC>
