He has aged visibly and put on weight during the years as apolitical outcast in Cairo. The villa and the guards patrolling itwith automatic weapons are courtesy of the Egyptian government,which granted Nimeiri political asylum after he was stranded inCairo by his defense minister's coup.   Nimeiri had just returned from an aid-seeking visit toWashington on April 6, 1985 when Gen. Abdul-Rahman Swareddahabsided with civil disobedience campaigners to oust him.   Nimeiri had been in power 16 years.   During a rare interview Friday, the former strongman wore awhite suit instead of the military uniform or traditional flowingwhite robes he favored as president of Africa's largest country.   He spoke of his anger at his defense minister's betrayal, hislife as an exile, the ``government of thieves'' ruling his countryand his advice to Sudanese supporters: ``Take over the power.''   The 59-year-old Nimeiri said he socializes mostly with Sudanesewho live in Egypt or visit Cairo and has little contact with hisEgyptian benefactors other than requesting renovations for thevilla.   His kinky hair has turned almost totally white behind hisreceding hairline. His waistline has expanded into a pot belly.   Nimeiri claimed overwhelming support in Sudan and urged hiscountrymen to overthrow Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi, elected in 1986in balloting overseen by Swareddahab's transitional militarygovernment.   ``I have felt hurt by the news I get from Sudan and about thesuffering of the Sudanese people,'' Nimeiri said.   ``Those who were deceived now call for the regime of GaafarNimeiri. ... I have received numerous letters and people, allasking me to save Sudan after it has fallen in a deep abyss as theyput it.''   Sudan was near bankruptcy when Nimeiri was overthrown, andlittle has changed. Experts blame a succession of weak coalitions'reticence to undertake reforms and work decisively to end a civilwar that began in 1983.   Sudanese appear disillusioned by Mahdi's lack of progress, andsome have been heard to speak wistfully of the Nimeiri era, butthere is no visible support for the ousted president on the streets.   Nimeiri insisted in the interview that the Sudan he ruled wasamong the world's most democratic and prosperous countries. But in1985, thousands of Sudanese danced in the streets afterdemonstrations against high prices, Islamic law and Nimeiri'siron-fisted security policies led to the coup.   Similar demonstrations have rocked the country this year and,under pressure from the military, Mahdi was forced to form abroader-based coalition and prepare to negotiate with the rebels.   Mahdi's government has convicted several members of Nimeiri'smilitary regime for corruption and has a standing request thatEgypt return the field marshal for trial. President Hosni Mubarakhas refused, invoking Egypt's long tradition of providing politicalasylum.   Nimeiri's presence in Cairo has strained Egypt's relations withits southern neighbor.   Twice the former leader has broken his hosts' ban on politicalactivity. In 1985, he sent recorded messages to Sudan urging peopleto restore his power.   This year, he has given a handful of interviews and admittedsending tapes and written speeches to Sudan to mark the 20thanniversary of his seizure of power.   Nimeiri said Cairo has expressed displeasure, ``but the pressureon me from the Sudanese people does not allow me to keep my word tothe Egyptian government.   ``I am not urging the people to overthrow the government. I amurging them to take over the power.''</TEXT></DOC>
