Until AIDS cut his brief career short last January, the 29-year-old New Yorker earned $62,000 a year and was rising fast. These days, insurance pays all of his medical expenses. But it doesn't pay his rent. Too weak to work, he is spending the last of his $15,000 in savings. &quot;When it is gone, I will probably go on welfare,&quot; he says.    Acquired immune deficiency syndrome has a devastating side effect: Before AIDS kills people, it often makes them paupers. And their stories show the vulnerability of many Americans to financial ruin, not only from AIDS but also from cancer, heart disease and other catastrophic illnesses.    &quot;AIDS has exposed in a very glaring way all the problems of the system,&quot; says Richard D. Dunne, the executive director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis here, the nation's largest AIDS-service organization. Indeed, the problems are getting worse in many ways.    Of the GMHC's 1,600 clients, only 20% are &quot;doing OK financially,&quot; mostly through insurance and their own assets, Mr. Dunne says. An additional 30%, largely intravenous drug users and their sexual partners, were poor to begin with, he adds. But AIDS impoverishes half of GMHC's clients.    &quot;Right now, having AIDS isn't my main worry. Getting food stamps is my main worry,&quot; says Kevin Madden, a New Yorker with AIDS. Not so long ago, he was earning $43,000 a year as a fabric designer. Now he is thinking of filing for bankruptcy. &quot;It's a whole new world I am being thrown into,&quot; he says.    It is a world of suffering beyond the power of doctors to relieve. Each year, illness impoverishes about a million Americans. Some 700,000 are elderly, according to the House Select Committee on Aging. And only about 25 million Americans are protected by long-term disability insurance beyond that provided by Social Security.    The number of Americans without health insurance has risen to 37 million, from 29 million in 1979. And breakthroughs in genetic testing may soon make it possible for insurance companies to deny health insurance coverage to additional Americans deemed susceptible to serious diseases -- much as many carriers of the AIDS virus are denied insurance today.    Disaster can hit hard and fast. Robert J. Casey, the owner of a New York electronics business, says he has many friends with AIDS who have ended up on welfare. For a travel-agent friend, the progression from golf on weekends to &quot;ward of the state&quot; took less than six months, Mr. Casey says. With 40 acquaintances struck with AIDS, the businessman says he has given up holding his traditional Christmas party because &quot;it had turned into a headcount.&quot;    Financial chaos devastates relatives and lovers as well as the sick themselves. After AIDS struck 31-year-old Paul Pryor several months ago, he became too weak to care for himself, so he moved into his older brother Peter's Brooklyn apartment. His weight eventually down to just 65 pounds, the emaciated patient lay on the living room couch day after day, staring blankly at the television set.    Before he died in late July, Paul could no longer stand up. &quot;It took me half an hour to lift him into bed,&quot; Peter says. &quot;He was very sensitive, and if you pulled the wrong way, he screamed.&quot; Once, when the building elevator broke down, Peter had to carry his brother up five flights of stairs. In addition, Peter says, his girlfriend's resentment of his obsession with Paul destroyed the couple's relationship of six years.    A former free-lance musician and carpenter, Paul depended on Medicaid to pay medical expenses. Peter earned a comfortable living as a carpenter and artist. But since his brother needed constant care, he stopped working in February. Because Paul could eat very little at a time, Peter had to be on hand to feed him six times a day. &quot;I always hoped he would eat more, so a lot of food got wasted,&quot; he says.    Having depleted his $10,000 in savings, Peter is now $3,000 in debt. Once, when his brother was in the hospital and he was three months behind in his rent, Peter ran up to the roof of the building to avoid a marshal with an eviction notice. He had to borrow from friends to pay the rent.    A home health-care worker, requested weeks earlier, arrived four days before Paul died. &quot;I felt angry because my life was consumed with this,&quot; Peter says. &quot;But I saw his suffering, and that is what motivated me.&quot;    Self-employed people like the Pryor brothers are particularly vulnerable because they often lack adequate health and disability insurance. But the corporate payroll is a shrinking haven. The best health-benefit providers -- companies with more than 10,000 employees -- have actually cut their total employment during the 1980s.    Practically all of the net job growth in the decade has occurred in companies with fewer than 100 employees, the concerns most likely to have skimpy health plans or none. Of all Americans without health insurance, 60% are employed.    Joseph Bombardiere is a New Yorker with AIDS-related complex, a frequent precursor to AIDS that can itself be fatal. Until January, he managed a small bakery and delicatessen that afforded him no medical or disability insurance.    Now, while waiting for Medicaid, the federal health-care program for the poor, he has accumulated $5,000 in unpaid hospital bills. Until welfare approval comes, he depends entirely on gifts of canned goods and such from his friends and church. Not long ago, he still had $5.56 in a savings account. But then he needed the five dollars. &quot;I actually have dreams of welfare checks coming in,&quot; he says.    People lucky enough to have insurance often are less well covered than they had thought. Among GMHC clients with private health insurance, fewer than 30% have coverage for prescription drugs, says Anne Milano-Tedeschi, a GMHC financial counselor. That hurts more each year as scientists develop better -- and costlier -- drugs.    For instance, the new drug AZT, which has prolonged and improved the lives of many people with AIDS, costs a patient as much as $10,000 a year. Despite his AIDS, one GMHC client stayed healthy enough to continue earning $285 a week as a messenger-service dispatcher. But his company health insurance didn't cover drugs. To qualify for free AZT through Medicaid, he had to quit his job and go on welfare, Ms. Milano-Tedeschi says.    Nationally, about 40% of AIDS patients end up depending on Medicaid. For income, they commonly depend on federal Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability, food stamps and local welfare programs. Ms. Milano-Tedeschi says her typical client was earning $2,000 to $2,500 a month before AIDS struck. But the most one can get through the various support programs is a rent allowance of $485 a month plus about $200 in cash and food stamps, she adds. In many states, the benefits are lower.    Bureaucratic delays and errors often destroy even these benefits. Carl Bleiweiss, a company controller here, says the first Social Security disability check for his AIDS-stricken roommate arrived three months after the application was approved -- and two months after the roommate had died.    When incomes are lost or sharply reduced, many patients also suffer the consequences of their typically American reliance on consumer debt. Assuming he would continue to earn a living for many years, a 35-year-old clothing store manager had piled up $4,000 in charges on MasterCard, Visa and other accounts. When he learned he had AIDS, he wrote to his creditors to explain that he was dying and couldn't work. He says &quot;they wrote back saying, 'We're sorry, but where is our money?'&quot; Lately, creditors have pressed him with increasingly threatening telephone calls, and he says he plans to declare bankruptcy.    Such problems enormously compound the mental anguish of AIDS. &quot;Even the ones who start out strong get defeated by this,&quot; says GMHC's Ms. Milano-Tedeschi. &quot;It saps their will to live.&quot;    Says Gary B. Brown, a teacher with AIDS who lived in New York until recently: &quot;All that weighs on me is the financial worry. I deal with the disease.&quot; Mr. Brown says that he was &quot;almost suicidal&quot; when he was diagnosed three years ago. &quot;I cried a lot. For two years, I waited to die, and it didn't happen,&quot; he adds. &quot;Then I realized that what matters isn't dying; it is what you do until then.&quot; He plans to get involved in volunteer work.    But, he says, &quot;When I went to Providence {R.I.} to visit my sister, she paid the train fare. I felt defeated.&quot;    Even in his weak condition, Mr. Brown had taken to walking almost everywhere he went in New York, just to save the $1 subway fare. Recently he moved in with an old friend in Wichita, Kan. -- partly because he was &quot;afraid to be alone,&quot; but largely because he could no longer afford $500 a month for a studio apartment.    &quot;Financially, there is no way I can come back to the East to visit,&quot; he says. &quot;There is a chance I will never see my family again.&quot;    Other large segments of the population are as financially vulnerable as people with AIDS. &quot;I have been shocked by the parallels between the problems of people with AIDS and the elderly who are chronically ill,&quot; says Len McNally, an official of the Village Nursing Home in New York, which is starting a program for AIDS patients.    In a Gallup poll three years ago, 79% of the elderly surveyed thought they might need nursing-home care and believed that Medicare would pay all or part of their bills. But usually, neither Medicare nor the private &quot;Medigap&quot; policies that supplement it will pay anything at all.    Like those with AIDS, the elderly needing nursing-home care must &quot;spend down&quot; all but a few thousand dollars of their financial assets before Medicaid will pick up the bill.    Both for AIDS sufferers and other people, too, the situation seems likely to get worse. A survey by the Health Insurance Association of America shows that practically all insurers require at least some applicants for individual health policies to take a blood test for the AIDS virus. Some 91% of these companies say they consider a person who tests positive uninsurable under any condition, and most of the remaining companies restrict the policies issued.    Insurers say that a 34-year-old man who tests positive is about 26 times more likely to die within seven years than the average man his age. &quot;If a company took all of its applicants, its rates would be too high to be competitive,&quot; a Health Insurance Association spokeswoman says.    Insurers say the average claim for AIDS care exceeds $36,000. And a new study for the industry by insurance risk experts finds that insurers will face $32 billion in claims by the year 2000 as a result of AIDS-related deaths of current policyholders.    Last year, the industry paid out about $200 million in AIDS claims, about 1% of the $19.6 billion paid in total claims in 1986. In contrast, the latest study estimates that by the year 2000, AIDS-related claims could account for more than 20% of total claims against some firms.    According to the study, the industry is expected to face claims totaling $14 billion involving people with life insurance who already are infected with the disease and another $18 billion in claims stemming from cases involving current policyholders who will become AIDS victims during the next few years.    The AIDS-virus testing currently conducted by health insurers applies mainly to applicants for individual policies, rather than for those covered by group plans. But even the large group plans are tightening access to coverage -- with restrictions involving many conditions other than AIDS.    Some employers are adding to group plans or more strictly enforcing clauses that limit coverage for &quot;pre-existing conditions,&quot; says Scott Ziemba, a consultant for Hewitt Associates, a large benefits-consulting concern. In the past, many companies have leniently enforced such clauses, which restrict coverage for such pre-existing conditions as diabetes.    In addition, Mr. Ziemba says, &quot;half of our client companies in the last two or three years have at least expressed an interest in physical exams.&quot; Such examinations help companies to avoid hiring workers who seem likely to develop expensive illnesses. If companies weren't afraid physicals might lead to accusations of discrimination against the handicapped, &quot;there would be a lot more action,&quot; he says.    &quot;AIDS has increased employers' interest in the high-amount claim,&quot; Mr. Ziemba says. Companies are looking for new methods to cut health-care costs, and &quot;trying to detect future ailments is one of them,&quot; he adds.    Beyond the AIDS-virus test, new tools may soon make such detection far more effective than ever before. In the past few years, scientists have discovered genetic &quot;markers&quot; for patterns of genes that show exceptional vulnerability to heart attacks; emphysema; cancer of the lung, breast and colon; diabetes; Alzheimer's disease and others.    The U.S. Public Health Service's Office of Disease Prevention and Control predicts that most Americans will be getting &quot;genetic profiles&quot; by the year 2000. These can help people avoid diseases to which they are most susceptible. But it could also make many people uninsurable.    Limited testing has already begun. Last spring, Chesapeake andamp; Potomac Telephone Co. in Washington offered genetic testing to 1,000 employee volunteers. When the tests show susceptibility to specific diseases, counselors suggest changes in diet and other habits to minimize the risk. If the experimental testing works well, the Bell Atlantic Corp. unit &quot;would consider&quot; using it in pre-employment screening, a spokesman says.    Some increased protection against financial ruin from health costs may be on the way. In the past several years, 13 states have started &quot;risk pools&quot; that provide health insurance -- at premiums between 150% and 400% of customary rates -- for people who would otherwise be uninsurable because of pre-existing medical conditions. A bill in Congress would encourage other states to establish such pools. Other bills would give the elderly greater protection against catastrophic illness, alleviate &quot;spend-down&quot; requirements for nursing-home care and require companies to provide health insurance. But the proposals all face political opposition.    Meanwhile, millions of individuals simply don't bother buying insurance. Often they don't see the need until it is too late. Says Peter Pryor, the New Yorker who ran into debt caring for his dying brother: &quot;I have no health insurance, either. That's what's scary.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
