It wasscheduled to run 16 days.   Director and spokesman Tim Walsh said Tuesday that heavy rainkept crowds away from the festival at Alexandra Palace, anexhibition and concert center in north London. He said the rainleft Alexandra Palace park muddy and made it difficult to stagemany events.   The night before the festival opened, wind almost wrecked aspecially built arena.   Prince Edward opened the $3 million festival Saturday. It washailed as London's most ambitious event of this sort since theFestival of Britain in 1951, which was held to demonstrate Britisheconomic and technical progress.   ``The Festival of London company has gone into voluntaryliquidation,'' Walsh said. ``The decision was made at a directors'meeting this evening because attendance figures were sodisappointing and because of the weather.''   He said it was too soon to assess the extent of losses but thatthey would be substantial. He said most people who had formalcontracts with the company had been paid, including manyperformers, and the company would do its best for the others.   The festival was financed privately by a consortium of about 15shareholders involved in the entertainment or allied industries.   Its 200 planned events included a marathon race, reconstructionof an Elizabethan village and Victorian streets and performances bythe Soviet Union's Moscow State Circus.   All festival events scheduled after Tuesday were called off,except for the circus, which will continue in its own tent inAlexandra Palace park.   ``It is a tragedy for London. This was the first year, and wewanted to create a unique event for London which could have beenheld annually,'' Walsh said.</TEXT></DOC>
