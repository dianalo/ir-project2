The Canadian union's bargaining plank contrasts with thatof the United Auto Workers in the U.S., which last week saidit would demand practically unconditional job security in itscontract talks. Both unions' contracts with General MotorsCorp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and their Canadianunits are due to expire Sept. 14.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. White, speaking at the opening of the CAW's conventionto set bargaining goals, said the union, which represents65,000 auto workers in Canada, also will seek improvements incost-of-living adjustments and income maintenance schemes forlaid-off workers. Job security, which Mr. White saidultimately cannot be guaranteed, will be addressed indirectlythrough such demands as reduced work hours.   &quot;We shouldn't fool our members. If (auto) sales drop off .. . I don't know how you can get job security,&quot; Mr. Whitesaid. The CAW official said he doesn't mean to criticize theUAW's demanding job security, but said &quot;philosophical&quot;differences continued to divide the two unions. The CAW splitfrom its U.S. counterpart in 1985.   The CAW also won't be pressing for greater workerinvolvement in corporate decisions, one of the main demandsthat will be made by the U.S. union. In a policy document,the CAW says management-worker team concepts often are usedby management &quot;to replace worker solidarity with totalidentification with the goals of the company.&quot;   In 1987, the CAW concluded contract agreements, which forthe first time included an inflation-pegged indexing systemfor pensioners, after a six-day strike at Chrysler's Canadiansubsidiary.</TEXT></DOC>
