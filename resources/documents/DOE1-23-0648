Sample results are presentedwhich demonstrate the value of the technique in studying variations ofelectron density with fine temporal and spatial resolution. Differenttypes of absorption event can be characterized in terms of the changesin the incoming electron spectrum inferred from profiles of electrondensity. The authors contrast the D-region behaviour of night- and day-timeevents in terms of precipitating spectrum and absorption profile. A softeningof the electron spectrum during the course of a morning event is clearlyseen.</TEXT></DOC>
