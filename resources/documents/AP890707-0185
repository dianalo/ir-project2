Augusto Pinochet is using hislame-duck presidency to make influential political and judicialappointments expected to endure long after a civilian successor iselected in December.   Opposition politicians and jurists expect Pinochet's apparentefforts to build a lasting base of power for the future will largelyfail, but they concede that, with the 60,000-man army behind him,the right-wing general could yet pose a formidible obstacle to thetransition to civilian government.   Pinochet has said he won't be a candidate in the election butplans to remain army commander after he gives up the presidency heseized in the 1973 coup that overthrew Salvador Allende, a Marxist.Under a constitution his adminstration crafted, Pinochet and thechiefs of the other armed forces are legally entitled to theircommands until 1998.   Pinochet recently said he does not plan to be subordinate to thenew civilian president and speaks of ``a kind of co-habitation''with him.   In an evident bid to preserve enough influence for such arelationship, however, his administration has begun renewing itsappointments of loyal followers at the local and national level,from town halls to the Supreme Court. Once designated, they cannoteasily be replaced even after the change of government.   The renewal began within weeks of Pinochet's resoundingreferendum defeat in October, when voters rejected a militaryproposal that he remain president until 1997. The loss obligedPinochet to schedule presidential and congressional elections forDec. 14. The new government begins a four-year term on March 11.   One of Pinochet's most powerful aides, Gen. Patricio Serre, thesubsecretary for regional development, has been overseeing thesytematic replacement of 319 apppointed mayors nationwide. Theirterms are for four years, and they will wield extensive powers ofpatronage and local spending.   Many of those being replaced, including some retired militaryofficers, have announced plans to run for Congress as a kind ofpro-Pinochet bloc.   In an effort to revamp the 17-man Supreme Court, the governmentrecently made a unique 90-day offer to 10 justices more than 75years old of special pension benefits the equivalent of $53,000 in awindfall payout each, to be added to regular monthly pension ofabout $900. It is an extraordinary sum by Chilean standards.   The 10 justices face automatic retirement when the new governmentcomes in. To get the pension they have to step down bymid-September, which would give Pinochet's adminstration time toappoint successors.   Justices serve five-year terms and have authority that extendsfar beyond simple questions of law. The court, for example,designates three members of a seven-member Constitutional Tribunalthat has final word on constitutional questions and four of thenational election board's five members. The Supreme Court presidentis one of the influential National Security Council's eight members.   The government also has accelerated its program for privatizingmany of the industries that remain in state hands and plans a lawthat will make the Central Bank largely autonomous, with the newpresident unable to replace its director and other key officers.Critics have denounced the measure as a bid to deprive the newgovernment of control over economic policy.   Nonetheless, the opposition contends that Pinochet's efforts willsink in a sea of political change after the election. They point toopinion polls indicating that presidential candidate PatricioAylwin, a Christian Democrat backed by a united center-leftopposition, has a nearly insurmountable lead.   Jorge Schaulsohn, a leader of the left-of-center Party forDemocracy, said in an interview, he expected the last-minuteappointees to shift sympathies, or at least show themselves to beflexible, when the new government takes over.   ``In a democratic environment, it doesn't matter who appointedyou,'' he said. ``I'm sure you'll be smart enough to understand thatyou have to adapt to what the country wants. This happenseverywhere.''   In addition, Aylwin has said his priority will be a plan to``democratize'' the country's municipal system and hold elections toreplace appointed mayors.   Schaulsohn acknowledged, however, that Pinochet's grip on thearmy commander's post ``poses a danger.'' He said the oppositionplanned a campaign to persuade the armed forces that it was not intheir or the country's interests to have Pinochet remain army chief.   Schaulsohn said he suspected Pinochet ``is trying to negotiatesome kind of immunity'' for himself and his troops, some of whom areaccused of human rights violations including illegal arrest, tortureand execution.   Francisco Cumplido, a constitutional expert and member of theChristian Democratic Party, said human rights would be one of thethorniest issues in the transition.   More than 700 people disappeared and thousands were arrested,tortured or sent into exile in a wave of anti-leftist repressionafter the 1973 coup. In recent years, atrocities have declinedsignificantly but some repression of dissidents continues, humanrights groups say.   Pinochet recently said he was considering a general amnesty forsecurity forces members who might face prosecution in ``littlecases'' of human rights abuse.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs July 12</NOTE></DOC>
