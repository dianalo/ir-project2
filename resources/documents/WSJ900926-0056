Elects Fuller Chairman,   Chief, Succeeding Morrow in February   ----   By Caleb Solomon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/26/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B16</SO><CO>   AN WNEWS</CO><IN>OIL, INTEGRATED MAJORS (OIL)PETROLEUM (PET)PIPELINE OPERATORS (PIP)ENVIRONMENT (ENV)</IN><LP>   Amoco Corp., the nation's fifth-largest oil company,elected H. Laurance Fuller chairman and chief executiveofficer.   The 51-year-old Mr. Fuller, president of Amoco since 1983,is known as a more gregarious executive than the currentchairman and chief executive, Richard M. Morrow, who has heldthose jobs since 1983. &quot;Larry could be an inspirational CEO,&quot;said Bryan Jacoboski, an oil analyst with PaineWebber Inc. inNew York. The job change is effective Feb. 27, when Mr.Morrow retires.</LP><TEXT>   As chairman, Mr. Fuller faces the job of improving theperformance of the company's oil and natural gas operations.Also, like the rest of the industry, Amoco could face hugeenvironmental costs related to gasoline this decade. Moreimmediately, Amoco must figure out how to recover more of thesharply higher crude costs encountered sicce the Iraqiinvasion. So far, the company has passed on only some of theincrease in the form of rising gasoline prices.   In an interview, Mr. Fuller said, &quot;The exploration andproduction business is the one with the greatest challenge.&quot;He added, &quot;The rate of return we've had since the early '80sis not adequate.&quot;   The company needs to reduce its oil-finding costs, hesaid. Unlike other oil giants, Amoco remains largely adomestic exploration company, though in the past few years ithas made roughly two-thirds of its exploration expendituresoutside the U.S., compared with one-third in the past.   &quot;That's the direction of the future,&quot; Mr. Fuller said.Despite the surge in oil prices to nearly $40 a barrel, Mr.Fuller said Amoco is making its long-term exploration plansbased on prices in the low to mid-$20s.   Amoco became the largest holder of natural gas reserves inNorth America after it acquired Canada's Dome Petroleum in1988 for $4.2 billion, but much of those reserves remain inthe ground. &quot;The challenge is to take those gas reserves andturn them into production,&quot; said Mr. Jacoboski, thePaineWebber analyst.   Mr. Fuller said there isn't enough available pipelinecapacity to move some of Amoco's gas, so the company may takeequity interests in planned pipeline projects to speed theirconstruction. Amoco also will open a Houston operation inOctober to try to improve natural gas sales.   In gasoline refining and marketing, where Amoco isacknowledged to have a leading operation, short-term earningsare being hurt because the company has been able to pass justtwo-thirds of the huge increase in crude oil costs through togasoline prices, Mr. Fuller said.   He added, however, &quot;I would not represent that we're notable to make money under these circumstances.&quot;   Longer term, Mr. Fuller said Amoco may have to spend $1billion to $2.5 billion on &quot;environmental gasoline&quot; throughthe mid-1990s, depending on the outcome of the Clean Airlegislation in Washington.   Mr. Fuller, who has a chemical engineering and law degree,joined Amoco in 1961. He has held corporate posts since 1981and was named head of the company's gasoline refining andmarketing business in 1978.   &quot;His first major management job was head of the refineryin Casper, Wyoming,&quot; recalled John Swearingen, chairman ofAmoco until 1983. &quot;I sent him out to Casper, a year later hehad everybody eating out of his hand.&quot;   Mr. Fuller said he will retain his position of president.&quot;I don't think it will be long before we look at thestructure of the organization,&quot; he said, adding he wouldcontemplate changes in senior management between now andFebruary.</TEXT></DOC>
