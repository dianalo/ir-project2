But that process is likely to be much tougher thanderegulating industry and trade, bankers and economists say.India's banking system, largely nationalized in 1969, isriddled with bad debts and hobbled by state-directeddeployment of its assets that effectively limits profitablelending. The state-controlled banks also support largebureaucracies and have been subject to political interference-- both factors that could thwart attempts at reform. About30 state-held banks and other financial institutions accountfor about 90% of total commercial lending in India.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The reforms we've seen so far can be fairly easily done,&quot;says a Western economist in New Delhi. &quot;But what happens asIndia moves into more extensive adjustments like reformingthe banking sector or taxes? These are much tougher politicalissues and they have to be addressed in the next year.&quot;   The strength of New Delhi's commitment to financialderegulation may become clearer next month. That is when aspecial committee headed by former central bank Gov. M.Narasimham is due to make recommendations for reforms togovernment policy makers. The committee's mandate allows itto suggest policy changes for all aspects of the financialsystem.   The committee is expected to recommend some deregulationof commercial banking, a move private economists andinternational agencies such as the World Bank have stronglyadvocated. But Indian bankers and economists expect thecommittee will stop short of calling for full privatizationof state-owned banks.   &quot;A very radical departure from existing policy will bemore difficult than in the areas of trade or fiscal policy,&quot;concedes S.L. Shetty, an economic adviser at the Reserve Bankof India, the central bank. &quot;But the system is fossilized andwe need to shake it. The question is do we do it throughprivatization or another way.&quot;   Commerce Minister P. Chidambaram concurs: &quot;Banks willremain nationalized, but they will have to become moreefficient -- we can't work with an inefficient bankingsystem.&quot;   The government's response to the recommendations could becrucial to the success of its overall liberalizationstrategy, independent economic analysts contend. Increasedbanking efficiency is essential if India is to spurindustrial expansion and exports, key goals of industrial andtrade liberalization. Currently, state-directed lending tiesup the bulk of commercial banks' assets, making what littleis left very expensive. The current minimum lending rate --efectively set by the government -- is 18.5%, meaning that atypical corporate borrower is paying at least 20% for bankfunds. Call-money-market rates, which aren't regulated, haverun as high as 30% in recent months.   Bankers say many state-owned banks currently carry a heavyburden of bad loans and wouldn't survive without the largessof the government, which has pumped about $1 billion in newcapital into state banks since 1985. Many such defaultedcredits were extended to designated priority sectors, whichsoak up about 40% of all lending.   &quot;The financial sector is the missing part of the wholereform effort,&quot; says Sanjoy Chowdhury, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'schief economist for the Asian-Pacific region. &quot;It's a mess --the banking system is totally inefficient.&quot;   To be sure, India's system hasn't been an unmitigatedfailure. A far-reaching branch system has made bankingavailable to a wide segment of the population and helpedsupport a rate of domestic savings equal to almost 22% ofgross domestic product, which measures the value of goods andservices less foreign income. Cheap credit has also nurturedagricultural production and helped small businesses.   But New Delhi has tapped most of the banking system'sfunds to fill an ever-widening fiscal deficit which reachedabout 8.5% of GDP in the year ended March 31. As a result,state-imposed cash and liquidity reserves now tie up morethan 60% of commercial-bank deposits. And government-directedlow-cost lending to farmers and other politically importantgroups accounts for almost half of banks' remaining loanportfolios, leaving few funds available for commerciallending. With interest rates for commercial lending fixed bythe central bank, competition is limited, as is profitpotential.   These constraints, combined with bloated administrationsand lax accounting procedures have made many banks commercialflops. Independent analysts say Indian banks carry a highportion of nonperforming loans on their books, with estimatesranging from 10% to 25% of outstanding credits. This meansthat some, if not many, banks are inadequately capitalized bystrict accounting standards. The central bank is trying totighten accounting practices to reflect a truer picture ofbanks' financial positions and gradually move banks towardinternationally recognized norms for capital adequacy.   Still, government officials, in interviews, indicate thatthey will try to improve the existing system rather thanscrap it for full privatization. Noting that the bankingsystem serves broader purposes of channeling affordablecredit to grass-roots borrowers, central bank Gov. S.Venkitaramanan says the state has to be &quot;sensitive to socialinstitutions&quot; and &quot;can't go back on commitments to thealleviation of poverty.&quot;   Also a factor is the anticipated reluctance of Parliamentto give up power over the banking system and the patronagethat goes with it. &quot;The problem is parliamentary control ofthe banking system,&quot; grumbles an Indian finance official,explaining why reform is difficult.   Paying for a revamp of the banking sector is also aconcern. The job will be costly because the shaky financialstanding of many banks makes them unattractive privatizationprospects.   &quot;Among the commercial banks, capital-adequacy ratios arevery poor and capital injections may be necessary.&quot; Such aclean-up may require financial help from the World Bank,economists suggest.   In the meantime, the government is likely to opt forpiecemeal deregulation, including limited privatization, inan attempt to introduce more competition into the bankingsector.   Among other measures that could be taken are aredefinition of the priority sectors -- mainly agricultureand small industry -- which now are allocated cheap credit.The central bank's Mr. Shetty suggests that bigger,comparatively well-to-do farmers and businesses might beexcluded from such preferential treatment. In addition,further interest-rate deregulation may be in the cards.   Another option New Delhi is likely to pursue will beopening the door wider to foreign banks and the fewnon-state-owned domestic banks. Noting that foreign banks --which account for only about 7% of commercial lending inIndia -- generally have strong earnings records, someofficials think they can serve as models for improvingefficiency for local banks. India, unlike some Asiancountries, is still issuing new licenses to foreign banks andis permitting expansion of branch networks.   Other Indian financial markets are less regulated thancommercial banking, and these are quickly expanding. Thecallmoney market for short-term funds has been decontrolledsince 1987 and has grown substantially. Through subsidiaries,commercial banks also are increasingly free to move intomerchant banking, leasing and factoring.</TEXT></DOC>
