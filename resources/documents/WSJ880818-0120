Morgan's Post-Crash Stock Price </HL><AUTHOR> Linda Sandler (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> JPM </CO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> JUS </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Spear, Leeds andamp; Kellogg, a powerful stock-specialist firm, lost a round in an unusual lawsuit that accuses it of vastly overpricing J.P. Morgan andamp; Co.'s stock the morning after the market crash.    The setback came when federal Judge Eugene Nickerson granted class-action status to a suit filed against Spear Leeds earlier this year by a holder of Morgan stock.    The judge's ruling may open the door to further suits, lawyers say. The plaintiff's attorney, Richard Appleby, said that the damages sought from Spear Leeds could total as much as $6.5 million, depending on how many people join the class.    Specialist firms make markets in stocks traded on exchanges, quoting prices and handling orders. They are supposed to maintain &quot;fair and orderly&quot; markets by using their own funds to prevent abrupt price moves.    Morgan's stock crashed along with the market to $27.75 a share from $41.625 on Oct. 19. The next morning, the stock's specialist, Spear Leeds, opened the shares much higher at $47, but they slumped to $29 within hours before recovering to close at $34.25.    Alan Weseley, who bought shares at the $47 opening price Oct. 20, filed suit in February. He alleged that Spear Leeds sold from its own account a &quot;substantial&quot; amount of the 500,000 shares traded at the opening, knowing that the price being charged was too high. A fair price might have been about $34, Mr. Appleby says.    Among those eligible to join the class action are officers and employees of Morgan, who also placed orders to buy Morgan shares at the opening. In all, 500,000 Morgan shares were bought by all investors at the opening Oct. 20, including Dr. Weseley's 2,000 shares. He is seeking compensation for the difference between the price he paid and an imputed fair price.    Jack Morris, a spokesman for Morgan, wouldn't say who the Morgan employees were or how many shares they bought. He said, &quot;We wouldn't attempt to stand in the way of any employees seeking to benefit from any appropriate legal recourse they may have.&quot; He wouldn't comment on rumors that Morgan may have compensated employees for any losses sustained that day.    In the wake of the crash, there were widespread complaints about big gaps in the pricing of Morgan and other shares. Spear Leeds relinquished its lucrative right to make a market in Morgan shares, apparently in response to prodding by the New York Stock Exchange, where Morgan shares are traded.    In seeking class-action status, lawyers say, a plaintiff's goal is to give the suit more weight -- and increase the size of the potential damages or settlement that may result. A defendant, conversely, tries to limit the number of parties eligible to join the class, thus limiting its potential liability.    Attorneys for Spear Leeds tried to have the Morgan employees excluded from the class; they wanted to probe whether the employees had traded on inside information. But the judge, in his memorandum certifying the class-action suit, said: &quot;This suggestion (of insider trading issues), if not 'silly,' as the plaintiff terms it, is at least premature.&quot;    Morgan's Mr. Morris says the bank has a rule that employees who trade Morgan shares must place orders through the bank's money management unit, J.P. Morgan Investment Management. Thus, he says, &quot;people trading are identified and we can tell whether they were in possession of material inside information.&quot; Those who placed buy orders for Morgan stock Oct. 20 had seen it fall pretty low and presumably thought the price was attractive, he adds.    James Nespole of Reavis andamp; McGrath, an attorney for Spear Leeds, notes that the judge has left open the question of whether New York Stock Exchange member firms that bought stock for their own accounts are eligible to join the class. No determination has yet been made on the merits of the suit, he adds.    Mr. Nespole says that Spear Leeds set the Oct. 20 opening price for Morgan stock after consulting Big Board officials. The Big Board declines to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
