Tom Campbell's bid forthe U.S. Senate.;   &quot;I'm delighted to have that kind of talent running,&quot; saidJohn Young, the Republican chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co.;   Others who saidthey were impressed by Clinton included Chuck Boesenberg of MIPS ComputerSystems, Tom Hayes of Applied Materials, Richard Carlson of SpectrumEconomics, George Marcus of Marcus and Millichap, Chuck Comiso of LinkCommunications and Larry Jinks, publisher and president of the Mercury News.Apple Vice President Dave Barram organized the session.;   With his emphasison linking government largess with individual responsibility and his abilityto speak in plain language about complex issues, Clinton made a strongpositive impression on an entrepreneurial crowd that has not often favoredDemocrats.;   &quot;I'm a trade expansionist,&quot; he said in response to one question,noting that unlike several other Democratic candidates, he favored givingPresident Bush &quot;fast-track&quot; authority to negotiate a trade agreement withMexico.;   &quot;I'm for open trading rules,&quot; he said, adding that the UnitedStates should respond in kind if other countries do not trade fairly.;   &quot;Iwas brought up to believe that if somebody mistreats me the first time, it'stheir fault. And if it happens a second time, it's my fault,&quot; he said.;   Inalmost every area of policy, Clinton emphasized a centrist balance ofdemands:;   (check) Universal national health care and lifetime workertraining coupled with increased productivity and re-examined pay scales.;  (check) A $35 billion cut in defense spending followed by further cuts,matched dollar-for-dollar by expenditures for civilian research anddevelopment.;   (check) A widely expanded student loan program from a nationalservice trust fund to be repaid by graduates' income tax payments or by two orthree years of national service at reduced pay.;   (check) Increased healthcare access for the poor coupled with workfare by able-bodied recipients.;  &quot;We have severed in this country the connection between effort and reward,&quot;Clinton said. &quot;I believe in carrots and sticks.&quot;;   Clinton also made pointswith the group with his approach to politics. &quot;The most important thing is tostand for something bigger than yourself,&quot; he said.;   Calling politics a&quot;contact sport,&quot; Clinton said the only way to respond to negativeadvertisements is to ask if the charge is true, fair and relevant, and if it'snot, &quot;then try to eviscerate the person who ran the ad against you.&quot;;   Hesaid his principal problem right now is raising &quot;enough money to escapeobscurity&quot; and make it to California. The early caucuses and primaries thatfavor his opponents take place long before the California and New Jerseyprimaries next June.;   Before the 9:30 a.m. meeting in Cupertino, Clinton hadbreakfast with San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer. After the meeting he had lunchwith Marcus, who was one of Michael Dukakis' key fund-raisers in California in1988.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PHILIP J.
