Samples from Saskatchewanand Manitoba were analyzed mineralogically by X-ray diffraction. Bothoil shale zones are thermally immature, and have not been petroleum sourcerocks across the Prairie provinces, except for an area of low maturityin western Alberta. Samples over most of the area contain up to 4% organiccarbon which is derived from humic kerogen; above that, total organiccarbon values ranging to 10% are provided by the addition of sapropelickerogen. Hydrocarbon yields on proylsis increase where sapropel predominates.Two areas of optimum hydrocarbon yield can be mapped in Saskatchewanwhere average TOC values may range up to 10% with average hydrocarbonrecoveries anticipted in excess of 40 to 50 kg/t from both the Boyneand Faval Formations. Lithologically almost identical, both oil shalezones contain inversely related proportions of a quartz-clay-feldsparmode and a second mode dominated by calcite. Kerogen content increasesto a maximum where the modes are essentially equal, or where calcitedominates slightly, but then decreases as pure limestone is approached.Numerous secondary minerals are present. Oxidation minerals are commonand are enigmatic to the preservation of the kerogen; whether such mineralswere formed by alteration during deposition and lithification or areweathering products in not readily evident. 14 refs., 13 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
