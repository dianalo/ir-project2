The holder group will ask a New York state court today to issue an order halting the $268 million leveraged buyout of the package delivery and auto parts concern.    In an affidavit in support of the plaintiffs, Interlink Express PLC, a British-based package courier, claimed that it was &quot;in the process of formulating&quot; an all-cash bid &quot;at a price substantially higher&quot; than the proposed leveraged buyout. The affidavit for Interlink was filed by Jules Lederer, who is identified in the affidavit as chairman of Francorp., a consultant to Interlink. Mr. Lederer asked the court to enjoin the offer by Purolator's management &quot;for a short period&quot; to allow Interlink to make a higher offer for Purolator.    As previously reported, a management group recently offered to buy Purolator for $35 a share in cash and securities. The tender offer, financed through E.F. Hutton Group Inc., New York, is to expire Wednesday. It requires approval by holders of two-thirds of Purolator's 7,650,000 shares.    Purolator shares closed Friday at $35.125, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowings. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    An attorney representing Hutton LBO, a Hutton subsidiary, said: &quot;I would be surprised if the court would seek to enjoin a tender offer under these circumstances, particularly when the plaintiffs have remedies at the time of the anticipated merger including appraisal rights,&quot; or the right to get an opinion on the company's value.    A previous class-action lawsuit filed in a New Jersey superior court by Purolator holders, seeking to bar the defendants from taking the company private, recently was dismissed.    A Purolator spokesman said that the company hadn't read the latest court papers and declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
