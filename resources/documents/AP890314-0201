(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fugitive Indian activist Timothy Jacobscannot stay in New York state to avoid prosecution for the armedtakeover of a North Carolina newspaper office in 1988, a judge ruledTuesday.   Lawyers for Timothy Jacobs filed an appeal even before the rulingwas issued, meaning he will remain in New York while the legalbattle continues.   Jacobs and fellow Tuscarora Indian Eddie Hatcher, 31, both ofPembroke, N.C., used shotguns to hold 20 people hostage at TheRobesonian newspaper in Lumberton, N.C., for 10 hours beforesurrendering in February 1988. Hatcher and Jacobs said they weretrying to publicize allegations of corruption.   A task force formed by North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin laterconcluded that the corruption claims were unfounded.   Hatcher, who made an unsuccessful bid for political asylum lastweek at the Soviet consulate in San Francisco, appeared before afederal magistrate Monday and was ordered held there on federalflight charges until next week. The charge may expedite his returnto North Carolina by avoiding state extradition proceedings.   The two men were first tried and acquitted in federal court onhostage-taking and firearms charges, but then were indicted by aRobeson County grand jury last December on state kidnapping charges.   Jacobs fled North Carolina before he could be arrested and triedto take refuge at the Onondaga Indian Reservation near Syracuse. NewYork police arrested him for speeding in December.   Hatcher fled to Idaho, but was arrested Friday by the FBI in SanFrancisco.   In Wampsville, Madison County Judge William O'Brien III rejectedclaims that Jacobs' life would be in danger if returned to NorthCarolina because of his knowledge of corruption.   ``You've spent the entire time here with the same informationabout drug trafficking and there has been no evidence of any harm toyou or any threats to you,'' O'Brien told Jacobs, 20.   The judge revoked Jacobs' $25,000 bail. A hearing was scheduledMonday to see if Hatcher, 31, should be allowed to post bond.</TEXT></DOC>
