There has been little sense of security, almost no comfort inmaterial achievement, because of the constant threats that allcould disappear in a wink. The economy was prone to earthquakes.Hundreds of ``experts'' said so.   One reason for the sense of insecurity has been the problem ofdebt _ of personal, business, municipal, state, federal,international debt, the multibillion-dollar likes of which hadnever been seen before.   Debts on houses, debts on cars, debts to Uncle Sam, educationdebts, credit card debts, debts to the Japanese, uncollectabledebts owed by Third World nations to big Western banks. Easycredit, it was said, was undermining human and financial values.   In such an atmosphere of fear, some critics went to extremes.They reasoned that if everyone is screaming, they have to screameven louder to make a point. Nothing short of total collapse couldget a listener's attention.   It led to ``The Coming'' style of analysis _ the coming GreatDepression, the coming collapse in home prices, the coming bankingdisaster, the coming great inflation, the coming interest-ratesurge, the coming decline of the United States.   So, where have those coming events gone?   Oddly, some of them might already have taken place, not in theirultimate, extreme, catastrophic form, but in smaller doses. The bigquake didn't occur, but there have been many sizable, lessertremors.   The financial system hasn't collapsed in its entirety, forexample, but repeatedly there have been large and painful financialdisasters.   Thousands of farmers lost their land in the decade, many of themafter violating their own conservative beliefs. They borrowed moneyand bought land at inflated prices. Some of that land fell to athird of its purchase price.   Some of the richest, most independent, glamorous entrepreneursthe country has ever produced were wiped out when crude oil pricescollapsed. Their buddies in real estate speculation went down withthem.   Simultaneously, commercial banks were forced to write offbillions of dollars in debt to the less developed nations, aftermaking loans that almost everyone in the nation except bankers knewwere overly risky.   Savings and loan institutions collapsed, at a cost to thecountry of scores of billions of dollars. Junk bond deals havefallen apart, wiping away billions in paper profits. The stockmarket has collapsed twice in two years.   Who said there haven't been financial and economic earthquakes?   Edward Yardeni, a Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. economist,who doesn't allow such terrible events to lead to despair, callsattention to some positive considerations. Assets well exceeddebts, for example, and savings continue to exceed credit demands.Moreover, personal savings are now rising.   What about the coming recession? Well, to some extent that toomight have happened. It wasn't officially recorded as a recession,but conceivably it could some day be recognized as such.   It occurred in mid-1986, when by some statistical measurementsthere might have been more than 30 states in recession. Offsettingthis, however, were booms on the coasts. In national statistics,the booms hid the busts.   The ``recession'' of 1986 didn't go altogether unrecorded.   In the second quarter of 1986 there was a decided decline ineconomic activity, but official figures still recorded grossnational product as expanding. Two years later the governmentrevised the reading to show a loss.   Meanwhile, the government also revised third-quarter numbers. In1987 they revised downward the GNP reading for that 1986 quarter,and they revised it lower again in 1988 _ and again in 1989. Nextyear, it could show a loss.   Two quarterly losses of gross national product constitute atleast one definition of recession. But if we had one in 1986, weprobably won't know it until 1990.   In short, the total catastrophes might not have occurred, butthere have been several lesser shocks. It leaves us to ask thequestion: Did these shocks relieve pressure, or are they precursorsof the Big One?</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv AMs Wednesday, Oct. 25.</NOTE></DOC>
