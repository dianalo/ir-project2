Detroit-based ANR, a unit of Coastal Corp., said it has agreed to acquire an additional 35% of Champlain from other partners for an undisclosed sum, bringing its total stake in the Burlington, Vt.-based pipeline company to 63%.    &quot;Obviously, we'd very much like a much larger share of the growing market in the Northeast,&quot; said Marian Droll, a spokeswoman for ANR.    Champlain's plan to construct a natural-gas pipeline to ship as much as 400 million cubic feet of gas daily to New England, beginning in 1991, ran into difficulties when Canadian natural-gas producers vetoed contracts to supply the New England customers.    &quot;ANR is a large presence in the industry, and will help us put together gas supply from a variety of sources, and allow us get on with the project, to meet the region's demand for gas,&quot; said Dwight Curley, president of Champlain.    One of ANR's first tasks will be to reduce the size of the project, Ms. Droll said, cutting the pipeline's capacity to about 240 million cubic feet of gas daily. </TEXT></DOC>
