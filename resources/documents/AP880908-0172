(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two men were charged with poaching analligator, less than a week into Florida's legal alligator hunt.   One of the men, 20-year-old Eric Brooks, had lost in the lotteryto license 238 hunters, said Burkett Neely, manager of the ArthurR. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.   Each licensed hunter is permitted to take up to 15 gators indesignated areas this month as part of the state's first hunt in aquarter-century. But no one is permitted to hunt alligators ordisturb any animal or plant in the refuge.   John Tommie, 24, was allowed to post bond Wednesday, and Brookswas likely to be released Friday, according to attorneys.   Brooks and Tommie, who said they work as roofers in Loxahatchee,were arrested Monday as they drove out of a refuge entrance.   They were wet after their canoe tipped in the L-7 canal and theyhad a .22-caliber rifle, a flashlight and a 28-inch section ofalligator tail, Neely said.   After the arrest, ``Brooks stated that he and Tommie knew therewere lots of `lizards in the canal' and decided to go out and getsome,'' court documents said.   Later, the officers found a dead, tailless alligator withmultiple gunshot wounds, Neely said.   Although estimates place the alligator population in Florida at1 million, federal law considers the alligator to be ``threatenedby similarity,'' Neely said.   He said that the American alligator looks similar to theAmerican crocodile, which is endangered. In order to protect therefuge's crocodiles, alligators are also protected.</TEXT></DOC>
