The same storm poured heavy rain from Oklahoma intothe Gulf states, forcing scores to evacuate and causing one death.   Tornadoes caused scattered damage in Louisiana early Saturdayafter hitting four towns in eastern Texas on Friday.   ``We had wave after wave of thunderstorms move into this areaduring the night,'' said Mike Koziara of the National WeatherService in New Orleans. ``They raked it hour after hour after hourafter hour.''   Snow and blowing snow continued to bedevil travelers insoutheastern Colorado, where wind gusted to 40 mph, and many roadswere closed in the Oklahoma Panhandle and western Kansas, where12-foot snowdrifts were reported.   ``We're snowed in _ we're out of electricity and can hardlymove,'' Pete Barnes, the mayor of Elkhart, Kan., said Saturdaymorning. Power was restored before noon to the town in southwesternKansas, by a utility crew that came by helicopter.   Louisiana was hit hard Saturday. In the New Orleans suburb ofMarrero, about 200 people had to leave their homes. A tornadodamaged 30 to 40 houses and 20 businesses in Slidell andneighboring parts of St. Tammany Parish, where fallen trees leftmany subdivisions without power into the afternoon.   Only 10 to 20 houses were flooded in New Orleans itself, butbags of trash left out for garbage pickup floated down St. CharlesAvenue while cars drove along the raised streetcar tracks in themedian.   New Orleans and Gretna, on the west bank of the Mississippi,both got 8 inches of rain in 12 hours, with more expected, theweather service said.   One woman drowned early Saturday in Marrero when she turned offa flooded street and drove into a drainage canal, said Sgt. JohnFortunato of the Jefferson Parish sheriff's office.   Flood crests were forecast from Sunday into Wednesday along manyrivers in southern Louisiana.   Water also flowed into dozens of homes Saturday in Mississippi,officials reported. Civil defense director Wade Guice said 4.2inches of rain fell on Harrison County from midnight to noonSaturday, and that the flooding was not from streams but from waterstanding on already saturated ground.   Oklahoma had both floods and snow, from 23 inches of snow in thePanhandle to 4 feet of water in streets in Skiatook, in thenortheastern part of the state.   Skiatook fire officials said about 30 homes were evacuated andmore than 15 businesses were shut down after Bird Creek overflowed.The water began to recede Saturday afternoon, said Fire Capt.Lonnie Fisher.   One Skiatook resident, Arthur Elam, 88, rejected pleas fromneighbors to move to higher ground because of his dog, Blackie.   ``No one would want to let him in their house,'' Elam said,adding that Blackie wouldn't like getting out in the water. ``Thiswater bothers me, but it don't bother me bad.''   In the Oklahoma Panhandle, ``We're just now starting to opensome roads back up,'' said Rick Foreman, a communications officerat the state Highway Patrol. He said all but two highways inCimarron and Texas counties were closed during the morning.   In the west-central Kansas town of Syracuse, 105 travelersstranded by highway closings spent the night in the high schoolgymnasium after the town's motels filled up, said a policedispatcher who wouldn't give her name.   Those travelers left when roads were reopened Saturday morning.But Interstate 70 from Goodland, Kan., to Limon, Colo., remainedclosed by dusk Saturday, and the Kansas Highway Patrol shut down a100-mile stretch of the interstate's west-bound lanes, fromGoodland to WaKeeny, Kan., after motels in Goodland filled tocapacity late Saturday afternoon.   In the adjacent southeastern corner of Colorado, 20 inches ofsnow had fallen at Walsh with 16 inches at Fowler. The weatherservice said snowdrifts stood 4 to 5 feet high in the area.   In nearby Clayton, N.M., where 8 to 10 inches of snow fell,travelers resumed their journeys Saturday after spending the nightstranded in the town. About 140 people took shelter at the FirstUnited Methodist Church when motels filled up, carloads of peoplewent to other churches and the National Guard Armory, and 65 stayedat the Fire Department.   In Albuquerque, up to 100,000 customers lost power for a timeFriday when up to a foot of heavy snow downed power lines.   In Chandler, Kan., about seven families moved out of their homesFriday night because of rising water.   ``They're kind of used to it,'' said Lincoln County CivilDefense Director Mike Clarkson. ``They just kind of put things uphigh on the lower floors and move out for a few hours.''</TEXT></DOC>
