In its annual global survey, the human rights organizationreiterated its opposition to capital punishment and said the 11prisoners executed in the United States last year raised the totalsince 1977 to 104.   The death row population grew to an unprecedented 2,182prisoners in 34 states by the end of 1988, it said.   Amnesty International raised concerns about Filberto Ojeda Rios,a Puerto Rican independence supporter held in pre-trial detentionin Connecticut for 32 months on armed robbery charges.   A federal court ordered his release on bail in May 1988, saying``due process cannot tolerate any further pre-trial detention.''   However, he was arrested again three months later and chargedwith a new offense of assault relating to his original arrest in1985. Ojeda Rios was denied bail and again placed in detention.   Amnesty said he was held ``in virtual incommunicado detention''with only limited access to lawyers.   It expressed concern that Ojeda Rios' lengthy pre-trialdetention may have undermined his right to be tried within areasonable period or else be released.   The human rights group also said it asked Gov. George Deukmejianof California to order an inquiry into the case of a former memberof the Black Panther Party serving a life sentence in Californiafor a 1972 murder conviction.   Elmer ``Geronimo'' Pratt may have been denied a fair trialbecause of his political activities, Amnesty said.   It said new evidence obtained after Pratt's trial indicated hewas targeted for ``neutralization'' by the FBI between 1968 and1971 because of his political activities.   It said the evidence also revealed the chief prosecution witnesswas an FBI informant and that the FBI planted informers in Pratt'sdefense teams.   A 1985 court hearing dismissed Pratt's motion for a new trial,ruling that the chief prosecution witness had been an FBI contact,not an informer, and that Pratt had not suffered as a result of thesurveillance on his defense team.   In June 1988, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal also turned downhis appeal on technical grounds.   Amnesty said Deukmejian told them he was without the``authority, ability and resources'' to order an inquiry.   On other matters, Amnesty said it investigated reports thatprisoners in several state prisons had been ill-treated, includingthe Michael Unit of the Texas Department of Corrections whereguards allegedly beat prisoners who were handcuffed and kept in legirons.   The warden of Michael Unit informed Amnesty that no suchincidents had occurred, the report said.   Amnesty said it also looked into reports that prisoners in theAdministrative Control Unit of the Southern Ohio CorrectionalFacility were shackled and chained to cell fixtures. Others werealleged to have been sprayed with mace and high-pressure water andleft in empty, unheated cells for several days.   Prison authorities denied that prisoners had been ill-treatedbut admitted that shackles, chains and mace were used forrestraining purposes, Amnesty said.   The international human rights organization said it alsoconcluded that conditions in the High Security Unit of Kentucky'sLexington Federal Prison were substandard. The unit has since beenclosed.</TEXT></DOC>
