Relationship betweenmelting current of wet snow accretion and its melting ratio were derivedfrom the calculated results using the formula of the current requiredfor melting accreted snow on wires. As a result, it was shown numericallythat a live current on the line prior to the initiation of snow accretionis effective to prevent wet snow accretion. When liquid water contentof accreted snow arrived over about 30%, snow accreted on wires werespontaneously dropped. The equation to define the current required forpreventing wet snow accretion are derived on the basis of heat balanceanalysis of accreted snow. For preventing wet snow damages on power lines,in the case of wet snow with liquid water contents of 10% and the snowintensityof 5cm/h under the wind velocity of 5-10m/s and a temperature of around1{sup 0}C, it is required that current exceeding 30-50% of rated permissblecurrent should be applied prior to the beginning of wet snow sleeve developed.(8 figs, 1 tab, 7 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
