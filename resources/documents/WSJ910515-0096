Prices tumbled under the weight of weak industrial demand.After losing as much as three cents a pound yesterday, copperfor July delivery ended 1.75 cents lower at 97.5 cents.</LP><TEXT>   While the recession caused prices of most other basemetals to decline, copper prices had remained buoyant duringrecent months because of aggressive buying of physical copperin London. Sumitomo Corp., the big Japanese conglomerate, hasbeen most frequently mentioned as the buyer, but there may beothers involved as well, said Robert G. Green, president ofConnecticut Minerals andamp; Metals Inc., of Darien, Conn.   Aggressive buying of readily available copper supplies bySumitomo and others caused the price to rise, which wouldnormally draw in more supply, Mr. Green said. But productionconstraints caused a tight supply of deliverable metal in theshort term, he said.   Availability of additional supplies was limited in partbecause of a bottleneck in smelting copper concentrate intorefined copper. Environmental regulations have constrainednew smelter capacity over the last five years, Mr. Greenexplained.   Judging from the tightness in nearby supplies, the squeezeoperation can be traced as far back as mid-September 1990,when spot London prices reached $1.34, Mr. Green said.   The price of copper, however, has plummeted since thenunder aggressive selling of futures by funds and hedgers. Mr.Green said the decline was more than the traders whoattempted the squeeze play could cope with.   Copper prices had looked as if they would break severaltimes this year, but they &quot;bounced back with a vengeance,&quot;Mr. Green said. This time, with softening demand in mostmarkets of the world and the slack summer period justbeginning, it appears unlikely that prices will snap back, hesaid. And if the price continues to fall, the operation willhave failed, Mr. Green said.   Jun Ueda, head of Sumitomo's copper and precious metaltrading in the U.S., said Sumitomo has been buying copper inthe U.S. and London to meet heavy demand for physical copperby customers in Japan, Taiwan and Singapore. Sumitomo usedthe London Metal Exchange to hedge the physical purchases, headded.   &quot;We're not trading for speculation. Orders are alwaysbased on the customer {demand},&quot; he said, adding that companypolicy strictly prohibits speculation.   For the moment, the squeeze in London appears to be overand the growing imbalance of supply over demand is theforemost concern among traders.   In the first quarter of this year, world-wide mineproduction rose 10% from a year ago, while copper consumptionfell by 3.5%, said Fred Demler, metals economist atPaineWebber. Copper consumption in the U.S. was off by about9% from a year ago, he added.   Adding to the bearish sentiment yesterday was a report bythe London Metal Exchange that stocks continued to rise andare at a seven-year high, Mr. Demler said.   Also contributing to the supply rise this year has beenthe absence of labor unrest and other disruptions. Since1987, such supply disruptions have reduced copper output byabout 400,000 tons a year, Mr. Demler said.   However, major labor contracts are coming up fornegotiation over the next six months. And while LMEinventories are high, producer and consumer stocks world-wideamount to only 4.2 weeks of use, well below the equilibriumlevel of five to six weeks, he said. A strike in Polandreported early yesterday caused prices to firm briefly.   Barring any supply interruptions, copper could be tradingaround 90 cents by the end of the month and 80 cents by July,a major commercial trader predicted.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Petroleum futures were mostly lower as marketparticipants turned cautious ahead of the weekly release ofU.S. oil statistics. Unleaded gasoline for June delivery fell1.34 cents a gallon to settle at 70.10 cents, the lowestclose since April on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Junecrude oil dropped 17 cents a barrel to $20.74 after reachinga low during the day of $20.63 a barrel, an importanttechnical point. After futures trading had closed, theAmerican Petroleum Institute reported its weekly figures,which showed increases in inventories of crude oil,distillates and gasoline as well as higher refineryoperations. The gains for crude oil and distillates,including home heating oil, were relatively modest, butgasoline stocks jumped 1.9 million barrels to 206.2 million.&quot;This report was probably friendly to crude but negative forgasoline,&quot; said Peter Beutel, director of the energy group atPegasus Econometric. But he said there may be little in theAPI figures to keep crude above the $20.63 level in tradingtoday. &quot;If crude breaks that, it could possibly show a turnin the direction of the {market} trend,&quot; Mr. Beutel added.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures contractsdropped amid speculation that U.S. farmers are planting moreacres to soybeans than expected. The speculation is based onan Agriculture Department report on the number of farmers whosigned up to participate in this year's price-supportprograms. The report indicates that farmers in the programsmight have planted up to two million more acres than expectedto soybeans. Prices of corn futures contracts rose onspeculation that farmers planted fewer acres of corn to makeroom for more soybeans. Traders won't know whether additionalsoybean acreage actually materialized until the governmentreleases a planting survey in late June, said Daniel W.Basse, director of market research at AgResource Co.,Chicago. Prices of wheat futures contracts dropped.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices set life-of-contract highs oncontinued concerns about tight supply. Cotton for Julydelivery ended 1.7 cents a pound higher at 90.33 cents.Stocks of old-crop cotton will only last through aboutmid-September, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers. Normally that wouldn't be a problem becausethe new crop begins to be harvested in mid-August. But poorweather has put plantings well behind schedule in the keyearly-crop growing areas, she said. Louisiana and Mississippiusually have about 75% of their cotton in the ground by now,but have only planted 6% and 9% respectively so far thisyear, she said. Texas also got off to a late start because ofrainy weather, and in California, unseasonably cool weatherhas slowed plant growth. Concerns are also rising that thesmaller early crop also won't be of high quality, she added.All these considerations have made July cotton particularlyattractive because it is the last futures contract thatassures delivery of old-crop cotton, she said. July cottoncould rise to between 92 cents to 94 cents soon, shepredicted.</TEXT></DOC>
