The regulations also apply to annuitants.On March 10, 1988, OPM published proposed regulations in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 7763) that would permit an employee tocontinue his or her FEHB coverage while in leave without pay for activeduty military service for up to 12 months, unless he/she elects to havethe enrollment terminated as of the day before entering active duty. Asimilar choice would be permitted for an annuitant in the same situation,except that a continued enrollment would not terminate after 12 monthsif the annuity continues while he or she is on active duty.We received written comments from four Federal agencies and five individuals.All were greatly in favor of the proposed regulations. One commenter requesteda clarification and another made a suggestion.A Federal agency was concerned that an employee's written request to terminatethe enrollment would have the same effect a voluntary cancellation wouldhave on the employee's right to a temporary extension of coverage and onhis or her eligibility to continue coverage after retirement. Because thewritten request would be for the enrollment to be <T3>terminated,</T3> rather than cancelled, the same rights would applyas for any other reason for a termination of coverage. The employee wouldhave a 31-day temporary extension of coverage, and the break in coveragewould not count against the employee in meeting the five-year coveragerequirement prior to retirement.An individual suggested that the employee who continues the enrollmentbe allowed to retain the coverage indefinitely beyond the twelve-monthcut-off date, while continuing to pay the employee share of the premiums.We cannot adopt this suggestion because we feel it would be treating asmall group of employees more favorably than other employees in leave-without-paystatus.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because they primarily affectFederal employees, annuitants, and former spouses.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 890</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedures, Government employees, Health insurance.<ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM amends 5 CFR Part 890 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 890_FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM</ITAG>1.
