The proton beam enters the cylinder,passing upward through a window in contact with the Pb-Bi eutectic liquidthat must retain reasonable strength and ductility upon irradiation atabout 673 K to fluence of about 1 x 10/sup 25/ protons/m/sup 2/. Investigationsare underway at the 800-MeV proton accelerator at the Los Alamos MesonPhysics Facility (LAMPF) to test the performance of candidate SIN windowmaterials under appropriate conditions of temperature, irradiation, andenvironment. Based on considerations of chemical compatibility with moltenPb-Bi, as well as interest in identifying fundamental radiation damagemechanisms, Fe, Ta, Fe-2.25Cr-1Mo, and Fe-12Cr-1Mo(HT-9) were chosenas candidate materials. Sheet tensile samples, 0.5-mm thick, of the fourmaterials were fabricated and heat treated. The samples were sealed insidecapsules containing Pb-Bi and were proton-irradiated at LAMPF to twofluences, 4.8 and 54 x 10/sup 23/ p/m/sup 2/. The beam current was approximatelyequal to the 1 mA anticipated for the upgraded SIN accelerator. The powerdeposited by the proton beam in the capsules was sufficient to maintainsample temperatures of about 673 K. Post-irradiation tensile tests wereconducted at room temperature at a strain rate of 9 x 10/sup -4/s/sup-1/. The yield and ultimate strengths increased upon irradiation in allmaterials, while the ductility decreased, as indicated by the uniformstrain. The pure metals, Ta and Fe, exhibited the greatest radiationhardening and embrittlement. The HT-9 alloy showed the smallest changesin strength and ductility. The increase in strength following irradiationis discussed in terms of a dispersed-barrier hardening model, for whichthe barrier sizes and formation cross sections are calculated.</TEXT></DOC>
