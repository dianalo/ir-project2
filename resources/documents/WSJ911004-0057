Thursday's first-section volume was estimated at 600million shares, up from 471.9 million shares Wednesday.Winners outnumbered decliners, 690-327. The Tokyo Stock PriceIndex, or Topix, of all first section issues, which rose10.97 points Wednesday, jumped 20.70, or 1.11%, to 1882.74 onThursday. Some mild profit-taking didn't hurt the rally.   In London, following a gain of 45.2 points in this week'sfirst three sessions, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange100-share index dropped 18.6 to 2625.6, just above theintraday low. The FT 30-stock index lost 18.7 points to2019.2. Volume was 511.9 million shares, compared with 548.8million shares a day earlier. Stocks' decline was based on acombination of earnings downgrades by local brokerage firms,fading takeover speculation in some stocks and profit-takingon some of the market's recent leaders.   Frankfurt's exchange was closed for a holiday. StartingMonday, Bayerische Hypotheken-Und Wechsel-Bank's Londonbranch will deal on Frankfurt's bourse, buying and sellingGerman shares for British customers through Frankfurt's IBISelectronic trading and settlement system. The move willincrease competition for the London exchange's SEAQ automatedquotation system, which accounts for about 10% of theturnover in Germany's largest stocks.   Italy's stock market watchdog agency Consob said Milan'sbourse will shed its antiquated monthlong settlement systemin favor of a three-day cash settlement by Jan. 1, 1993, forall stocks traded on the exchange. And Consob ruled that byJan. 1, 1992, all securities intermediaries must adhere toMontetitoli, Milan's securities clearing house. Under thecurrent settlement system, any brokers unable to meetrequirements can block the settlement procedure for the wholestock market. This has come under fire in the aftermath of aninternational trading scandal that shook the Milan bourse inAugust and resulted in two insolvent Milan stockbrokersdelaying settlement of the August account.   Meanwhile, London stocks' drop Thursday dragged down someother European exchanges, where share prices generally werelower. But in Brussels, the leading index shrugged off itsrecent malaise to advance 1.6%. Stockholm, too, broke out ofits slump.

The index has advanced 192 points, or 4.9%, inthe past six sessions, and is up 35% since the beginning ofthe year.   Across Asia, stocks strengthened overall. Sydney's firmingwas supported by muscle in the local bond market. Taipeishares tumbled broadly, amid a pessimistic mood about thelocal political situation. Manila stocks' broad advance wasboosted by short-covering and a proposed three-year pulloutof U.S. military forces from the Philippines. In Wellington,where stocks rose, recent interest-rate declines have arousedfresh interest in the stock market by individuals. Seoul'sexchange was closed for a holiday.   Among corporate developments, in London, Forte eased 2pence to 261 pence ($4.57), as the market was relievedbecause the hotel, restaurant and contract catering companydidn't pursue a rights issue. The group, formerly known asTrust-house Forte, reported that pretax profit for the sixmonths ended July 31 sank 63% to #42 million ($73.5 million),as the Persian Gulf War hurt international travel businessand demand was weakened by recession in the U.S. and Britain.The results were below market expectations.

The nonferrous metals concern'sfirst-half consolidated profit, after payments to minorityinterests, fell 26% to 153 million francs, reflecting theslowdown in France's construction materials sector, therecession in the U.S. metal-processing sector and generallysatisfactory activity in the industrial minerals sector.Imetal said it expected its secondhalf earnings to show thesame trend.
