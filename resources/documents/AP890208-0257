On Tuesday, for the first time since April 1982, short-terminterest rates rose above long-term interest rates by a widelyfollowed measure.   Economists said the high short-term rates reflected thetight-money policies of the Federal Reserve, which is trying towring inflation out of the economy by discouraging borrowing.   The economy-watchers said rates on mortgages and consumer loanscould rise in the weeks ahead, but in the long run the tight moneyshould bring down inflation and interest rates.   ``The ultimate message is that markets expect future inflation tobe lower than current inflation,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, chiefeconomist of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.   Some other analysts said the switch could spell trouble, notingthat past flip-flops in short- and long-term rates often reflectedcredit crunches that led to recessions.   If banks raise their prime lending rate to cope with the squeezeby the Fed, a whole range of consumer rates that are tied to theprime automatically would rise. The prime rate is 10.5 percent andmany analysts predict it soon will be raised to 11 percent.   Long-term rates are ordinarily higher than short-term ratesbecause investors demand higher yields in return for the risk ofkeeping their money locked up for longer periods.   But for the last year, short-term rates have been rising andlong-term rates falling, trends that culminated in Tuesday'sflip-flop.   The rise in short-term rates has been brought about by theFederal Reserve, which uses the higher rates to discourageborrowing, cool off the economy and prevent inflation from gettingout of hand.   Meanwhile, the Fed's tactics have won the confidence ofinflation-wary investors. Because they are no longer demanding sucha big premium to keep their money tied up in bonds, long-term rateshave fallen.   The so-called inversion of the yield curve occurred Tuesdaymorning. By the end of the day, the yield on the Treasury'sthree-month Treasury bill was at 8.82 percent and the yield on thebenchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.79 percent.   By some other measures _ say, comparing yields on the 30-yearbond and the one-year note _ the inversion in yields had alreadyoccurred.   Kudlow said the inversion in yields signals a decline ininflation that will be good for both stocks and bonds.   Skeptics say the Federal Reserve does not have a delicate hand onthe tiller of the economy and is very likely to cause a recession bypushing short-term rates too high.   Since the Civil War, all 22 times the yield curve has invertedthere has been a recession or a ``growth'' recession, in whichindustrial production declined, according to Raymond Dalio,president of Bridgewater Associates in Wilton, Conn.   Dalio said Tuesday that a flat yield curve is necessary for nowbecause the United States needs high short-term rates to attractforeign money and prop up the value of the dollar. But, he said, ifthe Fed overdoes the tightening, which he expects, there will be ``adeep downturn emerging at the end of '89 or the beginning of '90.''   The current situation perplexes money managers, who have todecide whether to put money into short-term or long-term debtsecurities, said Dale Krieger, managing director of Carnegie HillAsset Management in New York.   On one hand, managers can get guaranteed annual returns of 9percent by putting money into short-term instruments. But by doingso they miss the chance to get in at the start of what some believewill be a bull market in bonds brought on by declining inflation.   Krieger said his firm's clients are playing it safe, passing upspeculation in the bond market and pulling in unusually high yieldson short-term debt. ``For us, this is a gift,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
