Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> NDX STK SCR </IN><TEXT>   Some folks who do program trading of stocks are a little irked by their villainous reputation among investors.    Program trading -- the computerized execution of large baskets of buy or sell orders -- is widely blamed for sharp variations in stock prices that have shaken investors since the October stock market crash. Traders, money managers and individual investors all complain they can't invest intelligently when the Dow Jones Industrial Average can rise or fall 30 points or more in a matter of minutes as computers dump huge orders onto the New York Stock Exchange.    As Shearson Lehman Brothers's decision Friday to moderate its own program trading indicates, these pleas for protection are being heard. The Big Board has extended at least until Feb. 5 its experiment in controlling volatility by restricting access to its order execution computers if the Dow Jones Industrial Average moves 75 points in one day.    But those who engage in the practice worry that basic misperceptions fuel the arguments over program trading and stock price volatility and, not coincidentally, sully their reputations.    One cause for concern is the belief that the process is almost entirely automatic and divorced from human control. A discouraged investor quoted in a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal last week asked: &quot;How can an individual go up against computers that are programmed to sell automatically when a stock hits a certain price?&quot;    It doesn't work that way, say program traders. &quot;People are confusing automated with automatic,&quot; said David Posen, first vice president of Shearson's equity arbitrage group. Human beings, not computers, decide to sell stocks. Computers merely execute sell orders at high speed, he said.    Another myth program traders want to combat is that their specialty is divorced from fundamental economics. Most program trading is coupled with offsetting trades in the stock-index futures market, they explain. Program traders doing this form of &quot;index arbitrage&quot; just take advantage of small price gaps between the two markets and bring them back in line.    &quot;It's absolutely the fundamentals that cause futures prices to be what they are and create the opportunity that we take advantage of,&quot; said Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities, a New York firm that specializes in futures arbitrage.    Mr. Gordon complains that news reports focus only on the downside potential of program trading, ignoring its role when stock prices rise. He said he was recently invited to appear on a television news show to discuss program trading, &quot;but only if the market was down that day. They told me if the market went up they wouldn't be doing the piece that night.&quot;    As stock arbitragers and other program traders see it, many smaller investors haven't grasped how fundamentally financial markets have changed in recent years. Stock options and futures, and continuing improvements in information gathering and transmission, have made markets more efficient, but at a possible cost of increased volatility.    Without access to costly technology, &quot;The individual investor can't day-trade against the professionals,&quot; conceded Mr. Posen. But he argued that shouldn't be a reason to curtail technology and force inefficiencies on markets.    &quot;When the car was invented it was clearly a faster, more efficient, way to go from one place to another than the horsedrawn carriage,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time, it was obvious that it was dangerous to be moving that fast on carriage paths. The answer wasn't to get rid of the car, but to pave the carriage path.&quot;    Perhaps surprisingly, that somewhat self-serving view of program trading finds some boosters among money managers and stockbrokers who deal with retail clients.    &quot;Volatility has been the scapegoat for a down market, but the fact is it has created some opportunities for the serious investor,&quot; said Frederic Russell, who owns a money management firm in Tulsa, Okla.    Malcolm Wilson, chief investment officer for Provident National Bank, says: &quot;If you're willing to look beyond the machinations of the arbitragers and the program traders, volatility creates as much of an opportunity as a risk.&quot; He agrees, too, that stock markets are more efficient because of futures and automated trading. But in arguing for controls on volatility, he carries Mr. Posen's analogy a step further: &quot;The car is more efficient than the carriage, but you've got to build in better shock absorbers and brakes to control the car.&quot;    Rao Chalasani, the market strategist for Cleveland-based Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben, suggests that small investors eventually will become accustomed to increased volatility. &quot;It is going to require a change in their way of thinking,&quot; he said. &quot;But things have gone wrong in the market before and scared small investors. They've always come back.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stock prices jumped near the end of trading, apparently as the result of a stock-index arbitrage buy program. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 24.20 points at 1903.51.    Volume remained moderate at 147 million shares, compared with 158.1 million shares Thursday. Advancing issues outpaced decliners, 1,132 to 415.    Blue-chip stocks were mostly up. Boeing gained 1 3/8 to 42 7/8, Aluminum Co. of America was up 5/8 to 42 5/8, McDonald's rose 1 to 43 7/8, Primerica closed up 1 3/8 at 26, Merck gained 2 1/4 to 150 1/4, and United Technologies climbed 1 3/4 to 36 5/8.    Losers included Texaco, down 1/8 to 37 7/8; International Business Machines, off 1/2 to 110 1/2; and Du Pont, which slipped 3/8 to 76 7/8. </TEXT></DOC>
