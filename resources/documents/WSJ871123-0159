The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said provisions of the new standard will be phased in over the next year, after it officially is published early next month.    The regulation will lower the allowable workplace exposure for formaldehyde to one part per million parts of air, from the currently permitted level of three parts per million, averaged over an eight-hour day. It also will set a maximum short-term exposure level of two parts per million for any 15-minute period. And it will require exposure monitoring by employers and training and medical surveillance of employees when a level of 0.5 part per million over an eight-hour period is reached.    Moreover, employers will have to provide protective equipment to all employees who work with formaldehyde, and they will have to comply with certain other medical surveillance, emergency planning and hazard communication requirements.    The new standard will cover about 2.2 million workers exposed to the chemical, and will cost producers and users of the chemical an estimated $64.2 million annually, OSHA said. Formaldehyde is widely used in the funeral, laboratory, foundry, apparel and furniture industries. It is a potential cancer-causing chemical, studies have shown, and can cause eye, nose and throat irritation or skin reactions, the agency said.    The Formaldehyde Institute, a trade group, said it agrees with OSHA that the standard will provide &quot;more than sufficient health protection&quot; for workers exposed to the chemical or formaldehyde-based products.    John Murray, the institute's president, said formaldehyde-producing and using industries have acted voluntarily to reduce emissions of the chemical, sometimes trimming exposure as much as 90%. The group believes three parts per million &quot;is a safe level,&quot; he said.    The federal appeals court order requiring OSHA to reduce by Saturday the permissible formaldehyde exposure in the workplace resulted from legal action begun by the United Auto Workers seven years ago. The union's concern arose over levels of the chemical in foundry mold-casting operations.    Margaret Seminario, an AFL-CIO health and safety official, said that while the OSHA action is a step in the right direction, it won't reduce worker formaldehyde exposure enough.    With the new standard, apparel workers will remain exposed to formaldehyde levels in the 0.2 to 0.3 part per million range, Ms. Seminario said, even though some studies have indicated this exposure involves a significant threat of cancer. The UAW and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers are considering possible further court action, she said.    Formaldehyde is used by apparel makers to make cloth wrinkle-resistant; about 941,300 apparel workers are exposed to the chemical, OSHA said.    The agency estimated that the standard will prevent as many as 48 cases of formaldehyde-induced cancer over 45 years among the 13,180 workers exposed to the chemical above the one-part-per-million level. OSHA said it expects that about 6,000 cases of respiratory irritation and 11,000 dermatitis cases will be avoided annually. </TEXT></DOC>
