The Officeof Technology Assessment and the Energy Research Advisory Board haveestimated that, with proper resource management and the development ofefficient conversion processes, biomass is capable of supplying ten totwenty percent of the nation's energy needs by the year 2000. This futurepotential is expected to be met in part by gasification of biomass toproduce gaseous fuels. These gaseous fuels can be widely substitutedfor natural gas and oil in existing industrial energy use patterns. Inaddition, they can serve as feedstocks for the production of liquid transportationfuels such as methanol, ethanol and gasoline. Wood and crop residuesconstitute about 95% of the biomass feedstocks available for conversionto energy. Thermal gasification processes are capable of converting over95% of the organic material in these feedstocks with little sensitivityto variations in the feed material. In this paper biomass gasificationresearch sponsored by the US Department of Energy's Biomass ThermochemicalConversion Program is discussed. The main thrust of this research isdirected toward the production of medium-energy content gases containing12-21 MJ/NM{sup 3}. This research effort encompasses both directly heatedand indirectly heated gasification reactor concepts. Research on fixed-bedand entrained gasification reactors operating at ambient and elevatedpressures will be discussed. Information on a unique gasification processfor high moisture feedstocks and research on catalytic gas cleanup methodswill also be presented. 7 refs., 9 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
