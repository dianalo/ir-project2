Picking right up on the otherworldly spirit of the development, Bruce Babbitt said, &quot;He will either be a front-runner or a ghost of Christmas past in a matter of days.&quot; Some analysts have predicted that Mr. Hart's first victim may be the current &quot;front-runner,&quot; Jesse Jackson. No doubt many Democrats watching all this unfold before them think it can't get much worse. But if Gary Hart can do it, why not Joe Biden? The more the merrier. Does anyone know the whereabouts of Walter Mondale, George McGovern or Eugene McCarthy? Where's Jerry Brown? </TEXT></DOC>
