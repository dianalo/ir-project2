The proposed amendment to andSection; 4.210(b)(1) was to clarifywhat evidence of death other than a death certificate is sufficient toshow death. Accordingly, the existing requirement for submission of thedeath certificate or its equivalent was proposed to be revised to providefor submission of a copy of the death certificate if one exists and, ifthere is no death certificate, to provide for submission of another formof official written evidence of the death such as a burial or transportationof remains permit, coroner's report, or church registration of death. Theproposed amendment provided also for secondary forms of evidence of death,such as an affidavit from someone with personal knowledge concerning thefact of death or an obituary notice from a newspaper, in the absence ofany official proof or evidence of death. The proposed amendment of andSection;4.261 was to broaden the anti-lapse provisions of the existing regulationproviding alternate devisees or legatees when an individual named in anIndian will predeceases the testator. Accordingly, the existing regulation,applicable only when a named devisee or legatee who predeceases the testatoris a member of the testator's immediate family, was proposed to be revisedto cover any lineal descendant of the testator's grandparents, thus includingcollateral relatives such as aunts, uncles, and close cousins. The provisionin this regulation that relationship by adoption shall be equivalent torelationship by blood remains unchanged. Interested persons were given until July 21, 1988, to submit comments onthe proposed amendments of these rules. No comments were received. Theamendments are, therefore, adopted as proposed, with an editorial changein regulation andSection; 4.210(b)(1) to refer to an obituary or death noticerather than to an obituary notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Determination of Effects </ITAG>The Department of the Interior has determined that these amendments arenot major rules under E.O. 12291 and certifies that they will not havea significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This determination is based on the fact that the amendmentsconcern only details regarding Departmental probate of the trust or restrictedestates of deceased Indians. <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Department of the Interior has determined that the amendments do notconstitute major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality ofthe human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,<T3>as amended </T3>(42 U.S.C. 4321-4347). <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The amendments do not contain information collection requirements whichrequire approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>These rules were written by Paul T. Baird, Director, Office of Hearingsand Appeals. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 43 CFR Part 4 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure; Indians_lands.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 3, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Earl E.
