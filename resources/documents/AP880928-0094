Indian newspapers put the death toll at 350.   Hundreds of people remained marooned in villages and towns inthe central state of Punjab. The government feared the stagnantmuddy water could cause outbreaks of diarrhea and cholera.   ``Punjab is most likely to be affected in an outbreak ofwater-borne disease,'' said the official government spokesman, whocannot be identified under briefing rules.   At least 1,500 villages in the state were under water, said J.N.Srivastava, an official at the Flood Control Center in Chandigarh,the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana states. At least 70,000people have been evacuated from the villages in boats andhelicopters, he said.   The government said today that 282 people in Punjab and threeneighboring states have died during the floods, caused byrain-swollen rivers bursting their banks.   In the flooded areas in central Punjab, where at least 130people have died, hundreds of people crowded onto small islands ofhigh land in villages along the Sutlej River.   ``My entire family is perched on a tree,'' said Tara Singh, aresident of the village of Kasabab. ``I have been moving from placeto place for the past two days to get a boat, but all in vain.''   Singh, 45, said his wife, three children and sister took shelterin the tree after the Sutlej overflowed into the village andinnundated their mud-and-brick house.   The Sutlej is one of three major rivers in the state. All threecontinue to flow above the danger mark.   Another flood victim, Avtar Kaur, said no boats were availableto rescue her elderly father-in-law. ``He is bedridden and has beenon the roof of our house for the past four days,'' she said. ``Hestayed on the roof despite rains because the house was full ofwater.''   There was no rain in the region today, and a senior governmentofficial in New Delhi said flood waters had begun receding inPunjab, Haryana, Jammu-Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh states.   The floods started on Sept. 21 after heavy rains caused riversin the region to overflow their banks. The rains continued throughTuesday.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thefloods had damaged 1.5 million tons of the summer crop, mainly inPunjab, India's primary producer of rice and wheat.   India had forecast a summer crop of 97 million tons.   Floods caused by the summer monsoon are frequent in India,Bangladesh and Nepal. In late August, monsoon-swollen riversinnundated three-fourths of neighboring Bangladesh. Newspapers said2,000 people died in the floods.</TEXT></DOC>
