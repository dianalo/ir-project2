(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Westall, Frank; Zakowski, Robert J.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>DEFINING A UTILITYandM;To the Editor:andM;Thank you for including System Sleuth in PC Week Labs' review of systemdiagnostic and reporting tools in the Sept.andP;  24 issue.andM;The text of the review by Winn Rosch was accurate and fair, and we werepleasantly surprised with the hands-on perspective and the positive,enthusiastic comments from the two users interviewed.andM;However, the scoreboard rating system used in the coverage was seriouslyflawed.andP;  It failed to account for the distinction the article makes betweenprograms that do and do not combine diagnostic and reporting capabilities.andM;The four programs that do not combine these capabilities -- Control Room,System Sleuth, InfoSpotter and PS/View -- receive zero scores forcapabilities that they do not possess, offer or claim.andP;  These scores wouldlead a reader to believe the System Sleuth has little or no diagnosticcapabilities.andP;  This is not the case.andM;The result is the unfair comparison of apples to oranges, which is reflectedin the widely skewed totals and poor showing of programs that were measuredfor features that they, by design, do not include.andM;One way to indicate the differences would have been to replace zero scoreswith &quot;not applicable.&quot; More preferable would have been two charts thatseparated programs that combine diagnostic and reporting capabilities fromthose that do not.andP;  This would provide readers scanning the scoreboard -- butnot reading the full review -- with a far more accurate snapshot of how theprograms do in fact compare in features and function.andM;Frank WestallandM;PresidentandM;Dariana Technology Group Inc.andM;Buena Park, Calif.andM;Winn Rosh responds:andM;I agree that &quot;not applicable&quot; would have been more appropriate than zeros inthe diagnostic scoreboard.andM;However, the scoreboard criteria represents the results of a reader surveythat indicated what features and abilities were important to users ofdiagnostic programs.andP;  System Sleuth, like all programs in the review, callsitself a &quot;diagnostic&quot; program on its packaging and in its promotionalmaterials.andM;The distinction between reporting and diagnostic programs was made by PCWeek, not by System Sleuth.andP;  The scores of the scoreboard reflect how usersof the product would perceive its value based on the criteria important tothem.andM;We agree that System Sleuth is a good reporting program that lacks thefeatures of a true diagnostic.andP;  We believe that it should therefore bemarketed as a reporting program rather than as a diagnostic utility.andM;ONE MORE TIMEandM;To the Editor:andM;Once again, William Zachmann mounts his soapbox and unleashes a salvo ofvitriolic and poorly researched anti-IBM tripe, characteristically cloaked in&quot;Zachmann-speak,&quot; which attempts to convince us that he is the world'sgreatest living expert on computing (Sept.andP;  17).andM;Mr.andP;  Zachmann should request a six-month sabbatical and utilize the time tointensively research the information systems needs/problems facing the 50largest U.S.andP;  corporations today.andP;  It may astound him to learn that there isa legitimate requirement for hardware platforms of every type and size(including mainframes), and a carefully architected software strategy thatcan make them all work in a synergistic fashion.andP;  IBM already realizes thisand is attempting to do something about it.andM;Robert J.
