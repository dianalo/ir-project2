Since unitization in December,1978, the unit has undergone infill drilling, repressurization by waterinjection, and is now its second WAG (water-alternating-gas) cycle ofCO/sub 2/ injection. Early engineering efforts, based on the high fluidconductivity of the reservoir, prescribed the use of larger than normaldownhole equipment in conjunction with the choice of an injection patternwith a high producer to injector ratio. This effort made possible thevery short transition time between late primary production and earlytertiary development. Due to over thirty years of primary production,reservoir pressure in the unit had fallen well below minimum miscibilitypressure. Reservoir repressurization, accomplished with water injection,was conducted prior to the initiation of CO/sub 2/ injection in September,1985. During this time, the injection scheme was also determined, contractsfor the purchase and delivery of the CO/sub 2/ were negotiated, and designand construction of the CO/sub 2/ injection system and produced gas gatheringsystem were completed. Handling of the CO/sub 2/ contaminated hydrocarbongas production was also considered, resulting in the design and constructionof a dehydration and reinjection facility. Treatment of the producedgas for the recovery of hydrocarbons is still under investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
