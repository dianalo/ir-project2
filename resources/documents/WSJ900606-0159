After two years of study, a top-level panel of businessschool deans and others concludes that many M.B.A.s today aremerely number-crunchers, ill-prepared to manage in therapidly changing global marketplace.</LP><TEXT>   Warning that business schools risk &quot;professionalirrelevance,&quot; the report urges sweeping changes, including agreater practical focus for teaching and research, moreemphasis on managerial experience in selecting faculty andtougher prerequisites for student admission.   The report also suggests &quot;new assessment devices&quot; to testapplicants on leadership potential as well as mathematicaland verbal skills. One possible result of the study is amajor overhaul of the Graduate Management Admission Test, theaptitude test that a record 290,000 business school aspirantsregistered to take this past academic year. The study wascommissioned by the group that sponsors the test.   &quot;There is a need for a fundamental rethinking of graduatemanagement education,&quot; the report says. Given the increasingdemographic diversity of the workplace, fast-changingtechnologies and the &quot;internationalization&quot; of business, thereport adds, &quot;simply preparing students to solve problems intraditional ways is insufficient.&quot;   Business schools generally agree with the report'ssuggestions, and some even say it didn't go far enough. Butthey caution that, given current high enrollments and thehealthy demand for M.B.A.s, quick change at most businessschools is unlikely.   Many business leaders and commentators have slammedbusiness schools in recent years for contributing toAmerica's economic woes, charging that M.B.A.s aren'tcommitted to anything but lofty salaries and titles. Manybusiness schools have responded by pouring more energy andmoney into public relations. They have done this partly toraise money, but also to boost their visibility in thegrowing number of nationally published magazine surveys,which schools have found can greatly influence studentapplications.   Business schools must be persuaded that more substantivechanges are needed, the report's authors say. &quot;If we continueto squabble and worry about who's No. 5 and who's No. 15, werisk behaving in ways that confirm what our critics have saidabout us -- that we're concerned only about ourselves andwith creating a narrow, materialistic perspective aboutbusiness,&quot; says John W. Rosenblum, dean of the University ofVirginia's Darden School of Business and co-chairman of the21-member study panel.   The Graduate Management Admission Council, the Los Angelesresearch organization that sponsors the GMAT exam, begancirculating the report among the nation's business schoolslast week.   The report doesn't list specific courses or topics thatschools should emphasize. But it recommends that eachinstitution conduct an &quot;honest self-assessment&quot; of itsstrengths and resist the temptation to add a jumble of newcourses, as many have done. &quot;More electives on informationsystems or international business are not the answer,&quot; thereport says. &quot;Neither are more foreign student exchanges orOutward Bound-type programs.&quot;   Most critical, the report says, are courses that stress&quot;managerial relevance.&quot; Contending that teaching and researchon many campuses today suffer from &quot;pedantic sterility,&quot; thereport says business school faculty need to spend more timewithin companies observing &quot;business practices in action.&quot; Itsuggests more collaborations between schools andcorporations, and even adjusting faculty selection standardsto value managerial experience among instructors, not justscholarly credentials.   &quot;We need to create a more real world environment,&quot; saysH.J. Zoffer, dean of the University of Pittsburgh's KatzSchool of Business and a panel member. With the divisionsbetween regular and clinical faculty at many business schoolsnow, he says, &quot;either you've got a practitioner who knowsnothing about scholarship or an egghead who knows nothingabout practice. Those worlds have got to begin merging.&quot;   Business schools could also become more effective if theyfocused their offerings and considered joining forces withother institutions, the report says. Many schools on theirown, it notes, are attempting to squeeze more into theirM.B.A. curricula while also training doctoral students andrunning growing executive education programs. To lessen theburden and allow more time to cover advanced topics, thereport says schools should require that entering M.B.A.s knowcertain material such as basic economic theory andfundamental accounting principles before they start.   Schools should also screen entering students morecarefully for such personal qualities as intellectualcuriosity, managerial aptitude, self-awareness, and &quot;concernfor the consequences of one's actions upon others,&quot; thereport says. &quot;While these skills can be enhanced in graduateschools of management, our schools cannot bear the entireload of developing them.&quot;   The report acknowledges that many of the changes itproposes won't be easy to swallow. For instance, looseningfaculty appointment guidelines will challenge entrenchedpractices at many institutions. And, say officials at severalschools not represented on the study panel, broad change isunlikely so long as interest in business schools remainsstrong.   &quot;Anytime you have large numbers of students, you becomefairly complacent,&quot; says Jack R. Borsting, dean of theUniversity of Southern California business school. Mr.Borsting says a review of his school's programs under way forthe past year is in line with many of the themes raised inthe report, but he laments that the report isn't strongenough to guarantee change elsewhere. &quot;I think the reportshould have stronger language,&quot; he says. &quot;People can justpass over this.&quot;   At the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, JerryWind, a professor of marketing who is heading a review ofWharton's curriculum, agrees that &quot;M.B.A. education has to becompletely reconsidered.&quot; But he scoffed at the report'ssuggestion that business schools must join forces to ensurestudents a complete menu of offerings. &quot;It's absurd. We willnot even consider it.&quot;   Mr. Wind adds that many business school faculty are likelyto resist the call for shifting their research to more&quot;relevant&quot; topics. &quot;Whether they are relevant or not is notvery important to them,&quot; he says. He also disagreed withadding prerequisite business courses for admission. &quot;You maydiscourage people from the humanities and sciences frompursuing an M.B.A.,&quot; Mr. Wind says. &quot;That would be terrible.&quot;   The Graduate Management Admission Council plans a seriesof meetings and other efforts to encourage discussion of thereport and adoption of its proposals. The council is alsobeginning a thorough study of the three-hour GMAT exam, whichhasn't undergone a complete revision since its debut in 1956.William Broesamle, the council's president, says thatsignificant change in the test might be five to 10 yearsaway, but that modification is likely.   One change already under consideration, he says, would besimply adding new written questions to probe &quot;socialinteraction&quot; and leadership potential. Another, he adds,could be transferring the test to a computer format, to gaugestudents through their responses to simulated businesssituations.</TEXT></DOC>
