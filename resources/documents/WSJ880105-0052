The settlements should result in a roughly $28 million gain for the troubled bank holding company in its 1988 second quarter, as well as a cash distribution to certain shareholders.    Separately, BankAmerica said it sold its 41% stake in Geneva-based U.O.B. Holding S.A. to its partners in the venture, Dresdner Bank AG and Banque Nationale de Paris S.A. BankAmerica said the sale of the stake resulted in a fourth-quarter 1987 pretax gain of about $70 million.    BankAmerica didn't elaborate on the effect of the gain on fourth-quarter results.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, BankAmerica common stock jumped 75 cents to close at $7.625 a share.    The litigation settlements close a painful chapter for BankAmerica that began when the company stunned investors in 1985 by reporting a $338 million loss for its second quarter. That loss reflected an $892 million provision for future loan losses, and launched the company on a string of successive quarters in which it racked up massive losses from problem loans.    In response, shareholders filed more than 15 suits, claiming, among other charges, that BankAmerica officers and directors violated securities laws by withholding pertinent financial information about the company. The suits, which targeted about $80 million of liability insurance coverage held by BankAmerica for its management, were so-called derivative actions, which result in damages being paid to the corporation, and class-action lawsuits, in which shareholders are compensated directly.    The settlements also end legal proceedings that might have unearthed embarrassing disclosures about BankAmerica's past loan-monitoring practices. For instance, the 1985 second-quarter loss of $338 million was largely forced by federal examiners, who asserted in a report that BankAmerica had delayed recognition of loan losses. And even before that loss was announced, then-chairman Samuel Armacost wrote a confidential memorandum to his top officers, complaining that he was being blind-sided by losses that BankAmerica executives were failing to flag.    In the settlements, a comprehensive agreement was reached between BankAmerica; its main liability insurer, Employers Insurance of Wausau, an affiliate of Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.; and a class of shareholders who purchased BankAmerica shares between March 1984 and August 1986. The agreement calls for the insurer to pay BankAmerica $39.3 million to settle the derivative claims, and for the company and Employers Insurance of Wausau to pay $21.1 million to certain shareholders to resolve the class-action suits.    A BankAmerica spokesman declined to say what formula would be used to determine how the shareholder money would be distributed, or what portion of the $21.1 million sum would be paid by the insurer and what by the bank.    The settlements, which include provisions disclaiming any inference of guilt by the parties, must still be approved by a Los Angeles federal judge. A fairness hearing is set for April 5.    Upon the judge's approval, BankAmerica said another settlement would take effect in a negligence suit filed by the company against certain former employees. In that settlement, Employers Insurance of Wausau agreed to pay the company an additional $8.2 million to help cover a $95 million pretax charge taken by the company in 1985. That charge resulted from a scandal in which BankAmerica had acted as an escrow agent and trustee for certain securities that were backed by phony or greatly inflated mortgages. Employer Insurance canceled BankAmerica's policy when the bank sued for damages connected with the scandal.    The negligence-suit settlement also doesn't involve any admission or denial of guilt.    George W. Coombe Jr., BankAmerica's general counsel, said the settlements &quot;clean the table&quot; of all shareholder suits outstanding against the company, except for a few minor claims filed in the wake of BankAmerica's 1986 takeover defense against First Interstate Bancorp.    Meanwhile, A.W. Clausen, BankAmerica's chairman and chief executive officer, said the sale of the company's 41% stake of U.O.B. Holding, the parent company of Geneva-based United Overseas Bank, reflects BankAmerica's strategy of focusing more closely on large corporate accounts, &quot;the top tier of the institutional wholesale market,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
