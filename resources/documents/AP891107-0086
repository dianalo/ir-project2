Partyofficials said he faces a difficult time.   Mitsotakis, whose New Democracy party won the most parliamentaryseats in Sunday's elections but just missed a majority, got theexploratory mandate from President Christos Sartzetakis.   Mitsotakis has until Friday to drum up enough support topersuade the president to let him go before Parliament with theproposed government for a vote of confidence.   ``In three days I will return to the president and inform him ofthe results of my efforts,'' Mitsotakis told a news conference.   New Democracy defeated Andreas Papandreou's PanhellenicSocialist Movement, PASOK, in national elections for the secondtime in five months. However, it failed to win the 151 seatsnecessary for a parliamentary majority.   Papandreou, who governed Greece from 1981 to the June elections,will be given a chance to form a government if Mitsotakis fails.The former premier has 128 seats in the 300-seat Parliament,compared to New Democracy's 148.   The third-largest party, the Communist-led Coalition of the Leftand Progress, has said it will not give the conservatives or thesocialists its 21 seats.   Three independents were also elected.   New Democracy officials said they expected Mitsotakis to have atough time gathering enough support for a government, especiallysince one of the independents was allied with the leftist parties.   Mitsotakis said he will not enter any alliance that will forcehis party to water down its program to revive the economy and seekcloser U.S. ties.   A continued deadlock among the parties could lead to a third setof elections this year. The conservatives were not enthusiasticabout the possibility.   ``I don't see new elections right now, for the simple reasonthat no one (of the parties) wants them, nor do the Greek people.Only in the event of a total deadlock will we go to elections,''said Ioannis Palaiokrassas, a senior New Democracy member.   If all three main parties fail to form a government thepresident will invite them to put together a joint administration.The leftist Coalition supports a government of all three parties.   New Democracy and the Coalition formed an alliance after theinconclusive June poll. That alliance was dedicated solely toinvestigating Papandreou and former ministers in hisadministration. It resigned in October shortly after the formerpremier and five of his ministers were indicted by Parliament.   Another set of elections would not necessarily produce a stronggovernment. The proportional electoral system introduced by PASOKbefore the June elections makes it very difficult for any party towin a parliamentary majority.</TEXT></DOC>
