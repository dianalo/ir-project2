Watson Research Center identified theneed for functional hardware to be used in the development of futuremultiprocessor workstations and parallel software, IBM officials said.andM;&quot;IBM is getting its feet wet in parallel processing at the workstationlevel,&quot; Dunning said.andM;&quot;The microprocessors are not state of the art.andP;  They're good tools fordeveloping software and building a body of experience [with parallelprocessing].andP;  [The Ace workstation] is a simple, straight-forward model towork on,&quot; Harrison said.andM;The 8ce workstation contains eight 32-bit RISC processors that perform up to25 MIPS.andP;  Each processor has 8MB of local memory and access to 80MB of sharedmemory.andP;  An IBM RT acts as a front end to the system.andM;The Ace workstation makes use of a high-speed bus with a transfer rate of80MB per second.andP;  Developed in 1986, the bus is &quot;packet-oriented, allowingbus transfers at every cycle,&quot; Harrison said.andM;Modified Mach UsedandM;The workstation uses a modified version of Carnegie-Mellon University's Mach.andO;Mach was chosen for its parallel processing support and because it wasdesigned to run on IBM's RT.andM;&quot;We chose Mach because AIX had no support for parallel processing,&quot; Harrisonsaid.andM;IBM's researchers extended the system to accommodate Ace's local and sharedlevels of memory by optimizing the placement of pages via a heuristicalgorithm, according to Harrison.andP;  The IBM researchers also implemented alogical link at the device switching level between the multiprocessor and theRT host.andM;Physically, the link is provided through a PC AT bus extension, Harrisonsaid.andM;Mach is used to provide message-passing and shared-memory communicationsamong the Ace's processors and to provide controlled access to the processorsfor shared functions.andM;IBM has manufactured and installed 30 experimental multiprocessorworkstations in-house, at research centers and at universities.andP;  Much of theresearch being conducted with IBM's Ace workstations involves adaptingdistributed applications to parallel processing environments, according toHarrison.andM;The laboratory at New Mexico State will use the machine for high-speedcomputation in artificial intelligence and software projects.andM;Research involving the Ace workstation at New Mexico State will includeprojects in neural network simulation, parallel programming languages,natural language processing and computer vision.andM;CRL researchers will tailor their Streamlined Image Transfer Editor (SITE) torun on the Ace workstation to experiment with parallel applications in imageprocessing.andP;  &quot;The software is ready to roll over,&quot; Dunning said.andM;SITE, developed by Dunning and Scott Williams, is licensed for distributionby the Pharos Group, which was formed by researchers from the CRL.andM;&quot;It's a loaner machine,&quot; Dunning said.andM;IBM's agreement with the CRL provides that software developed on theworkstation is the property of the New Mexico State research group, thoughIBM has the right to market the programs and to distribute them to other Aceworkstation researchers, Dunning said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
