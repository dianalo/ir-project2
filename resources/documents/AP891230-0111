(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Martin Marietta was forced Saturdayto postpone for the ninth time the first commercial launch of itsTitan 3 rocket, once again because of high-altitude crosswindsstreaking up to 102 mph.   The rocket is to boost communications satellites into orbit forthe Japanese Communications Satellite Co. and the British Ministryof Defence.   Liftoff originally was scheduled Dec. 7, but a technical problemdelayed one launch effort and the rest were scrubbed because ofhigh winds.   The winds had been acceptable earlier Saturday, but the speedincreased throughout the day as a series of weather balloons shotinto the sky.   When the countdown reached the five-minute mark, the launch teamheld it for 50 minutes while officials assessed last-minute balloondata. It showed 102 mph winds at 34,790 feet, about 30 mph too highfor a safe Titan passage.   A 10th attempt was scheduled for 7:07 p.m. Sunday night.</TEXT></DOC>
