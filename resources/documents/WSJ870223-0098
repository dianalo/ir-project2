For the year-earlier quarter ended Feb. 28, net income was $10.1 million, or 25 cents a share.    Sales are strong in most of the company's businesses, John H. McConnell, chairman and chief executive officer, and Joseph H. Stegmayer, vice president and chief financial officer, said in an interview. However, they said profit margins in steel processing, the company's largest business, continue to be pinched between higher prices for raw steel and resistance of buyers to price increases on processed products.    Worthington raised prices by about 3% on its processed steel in January. Processed steel accounted for more than half of last year's revenue and nearly two-thirds of operating profit.    Sales for the third quarter will be in the $195 million to $200 million range, up from $184.6 million last year, the officials said.    For the year, most analysts expect Worthington to earn a few cents a share more than the $1.01 in fiscal 1986. Worthington executives declined to make a forecast, but didn't dispute the estimates. Net in fiscal 1986 was $42 million on sales of $754.3 million.    Worthington's margins on steel processing will be helped somewhat in the fourth quarter by price increases, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Stegmayer said. In addition, there is industry speculation that prices for the steel Worthington buys may weaken as USX Corp. attempts to regain its market share following a lengthy strike.    The officials said net for its fiscal second half will far exceed net in the first half, but likely will show only a modest gain from the year-ago period.    Worthington's second-half earnings per share, according to analysts' estimates, will be about 60 to 65 cents, only slightly higher than the 59 cents figure for the year-earlier period.    For the first half of its current fiscal year, Worthington earned $17.3 million, or 42 cents a share. Sales rose 9% to $385.4 million, from $354.7 million. All share earnings figures are adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split paid Oct. 31, 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
