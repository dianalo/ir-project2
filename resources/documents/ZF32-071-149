(LAN Computing's first anniversary)(Viewpoint) (editorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Halligan, Tom.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>It's amazing how fast a year can go by, er, make that fly by.andP;  This month,LAN Computing celebrates its first anniversary.andP;  On one hand, it seems likeonly yesterday we put to bed the first edition.andP;  But on the other hand, itfeels like we've been around for years.andM;I say the latter because most start-up computer trade publications must putin a few years before they're accepted by the user community as one of thefamily.andP;  You first have to earn your wings, so to speak, before you can flyin this marketplace.andM;Well, judging from your comments these past 12 months, it didn't take LANComputing long to attain warp speed.andP;  It's pretty obvious that this newspaperis going where no newspaper has gone before.andM;Sure, we've tweaked and fined-tuned our design; we've added new columns anddepartments; scratched some that didn't make the grade.andP;  And we also returnedto our original monthly format following a go at publishing biweekly.andM;But even through our &quot;growing pain&quot; period, we never doubted or lost sight ofour focus.andP;  That was clear from the first edition: A newspaper devoted tocovering the standards-based network environment.andP;  No other publication wasdoing it.andP;  No other publication is doing it.andM;In his inaugural editorial on this page, Publisher Carl Marbach wrote: &quot;Thedemand for LAN Computing has surprised even us.andP;  Your response to our requestfor subscriptions has outpaced our ability to produce enough newspapers...&quot;andM;Marbach's comment wasn't just hype.andP;  In September 1990 we hit the streetswith 40,000 copies.andP;  Today, demand has pushed us to hike our curculation to60,000.andM;Obviously, LAN Computing is quenching your thirst for news and featurestargeted at the drive toward standrds-based computing.andP;  We know this to betrue because you've told us.andP;  Boy, have you told us.andM;Just listen to what some of your peers have said about LAN Computing:andM;&quot;Breath of coverage ...andP;  not just a Novell publication.&quot;andM;--Systems Manager, Fituh InvestorsandM;&quot;Addresses key issues on all LAN plat-forms.andP;  Many others are limited to justPCs or workstations.&quot;andM;--Analyst, Cincinnati MilacronandM;&quot;The emphasis on open systems.andP;  I like the Standards Watch, OSI tutorials andclient-server computing articles.&quot;andM;--Manager, HoneywellandM;&quot;Excellent coverage of emerging standards and client-server products,especially workstations&quot;andM;--Programming Manger, Dept.andP;  of DefenseandM;&quot;It keeps up with the standards.andP;  My organization can't afford to survivewithout adherence to standards.&quot;andM;--VP Operations, Wang LaboratoriesandM;&quot;It provides a fine counterpoint to the excess of the personal computerworld.&quot;andM;--International Auditor, Bell AtlanticandM;&quot;Interoperability and system integration are the keys to current computer/telecommunications environment.andP;  These are both your objectives and mine.andO;Solid articles on these topics give me insight.&quot;andM;--Professor, Information Science and Telecommunications, University ofPittsburghandM;&quot;Gives me a broader understanding of the network market outside the Novellniche I specialize in.&quot;andM;--Network Specialist, McDonald'sandM;&quot;You seem to spend a lot more time on LAN-to min/mainframe connectivity thando other publications.andP;  Since my company integrates LANs to AS/400s, relatedfeatures attracted me.&quot;andM;--Manager, Computer Guidance Corp.andM;&quot;I like the Standard Watch section and the articles on workstations (variousUNIX flavors).andP;  It gives equal billing to so many vendors.&quot;andM;--Systems Engineer, IBMandM;&quot;It's an excellent publication.andP;  Helps to keep us current on LAN systems,hardware, software developments, standards, protocols, etc.&quot;andM;--CEO, TAX Advantage InvestmentsandM;&quot;Complete coverage of OSI/POSIX standards and development of the PC andworkstation LAN environments.&quot;andM;--Network Analyst, Computer SystemsandM;And last, my favorite comment from a reader from Keffering, Ohio:andM;&quot;You have the right one baby, Uhhh Huhh.&quot;andM;You got that right!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
