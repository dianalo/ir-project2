It is now more thanthree months since the Burmese people voted overwhelmingly toend the socialist repression that over the past 28 years haswrecked their once-thriving nation. But the militarydictators in Rangoon haven't budged. Instead, they've kepttheir security forces busy with tasks such as shooting todeath at least four peaceful demonstrators on August 8 inMandalay, according to Amnesty International.   The signs are that the ruling military junta, apparentlyled by General Khin Nyunt, miscalculated in allowingrelatively fair polling in the May 27 elections. Though someof the opposition's strongest leaders were hampered in thecampaign by being held in prison or under house arrest,voters gave some 80% of the seats and 60% of the popular voteto the opposition.</LP><TEXT>   So far, the Rangoon junta hasn't even offered the winnersoffice space. The main opposition party's secretary-general,Aung Sun Suu Kyi, remains under the house arrest imposed morethan a year ago. Its chairman, Tin Oo -- reportedly ailing --is still serving a three-year sentence of hard labor, imposedlast December.   Burma's dictator, Ne Win, officially stepped down when thejunta took over to crush huge street protests in 1988. But NeWin is widely believed to be keeping a hand in theorganization's policies of gulag government. These haverecently included big resettlement programs, reminiscent ofKhmer Rouge tactics in the 1970s in Cambodia, apparentlyaimed at breaking up pockets of political unrest. Tens ofthousands of Burmese have been moved from the cities to thecountryside. One Western diplomat based in Rangoon told usearlier this year that in some cases entire neighborhoods inthe capital had been moved out. The resettlement areas areofficially off-limits to outsiders.   Burma's sad experience should leave us all leery oftrusting the sweeter promises offered by the tyrants ofAsia's similarly bleak Marxist nations -- Vietnam, Cambodia,Laos, China and North Korea. But if the junta can somehow beforced to honor the opposition victory at the polls, Burma'sexample could yet help inspire an East European-style sweepin Asia. Asia's tragedy is that the revolts in China andBurma have rattled but not yet broken the chains.</TEXT></DOC>
