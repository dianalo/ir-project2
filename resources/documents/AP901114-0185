JOB</BYLINE><BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   The 1991 Mercury Capri XR2 is a pleasant surprise.   Its low-slung body and sporty styling hint at a jolting, sportyride. But the Capri XR2's all-strut suspension is damped somewhat,giving passengers a softer ride that doesn't rattle the bones.   The Capri XR2's convertible top could make for a loud, tiringtrip, full of engine noise. But the engine sound and road noise onthis front-drive car, while noticeable, are not overbearing.   The cute, appealing look of this ``funabout,'' as Ford Motor Co.likes to call the Capri, also could tempt the company to set highprices. But the Capri ranges from $12,990 to $15,920 - attractiveenough to invite comparisons with its two main competitors, theMazda Miata (with a base price of $13,800) and Volkswagen Cabriolet(base price, $15,500).   ``The Capri is designed to be a fun-to-drive car, ... but wedidn't forget value and versatility,'' said Ross H. Roberts, a Fordvice president and Lincoln-Mercury general manager.   It took seven years for the Capri to evolve out of a concept carcalled the Barchetta (Italian for little boat) that appeared at the1983 Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany. In the end, the Capri'soutside design came from the Ghia Studios of Turin, Italy; itspowertrain and chassis were built with the help of Mazda of Japan,and assembly is done in Australia.   The blended heritage works well. The test car, an upscale XR2turbo, seemed at ease in many sport maneuvers as well as onleisurely Sunday drives.   The Capri handled easily, fitting into tight parking spaces anddodging between cars in passing maneuvers without a lot of effort.   Fuel economy was commendable - about 24 miles per gallon indemanding city-highway driving.   The 1.6-liter, four-cylinder turbo, teamed with a five-speedmanual transmission, provided up to 132 horsepower in the XR2 andwas peppy. That's compared with the 116 horsepower produced by theMiata's 1.6-liter engine. Turbo lag in the Capri wasn't troublesomein most instances. The transmission shifter felt a bit notchy,however.   The cloth driver seat had adjustable lumbar support and wasquite comfortable. There was an air bag in the leather-wrappedsteering wheel, and the interior design of gauges, including turboboost, was commendably functional.   The cloth back seat was another matter. It was benchlike and wasa stiff resting spot with a straight seatback. I hit my head on abar on the convertible roof while sitting there. I could not holdmy head up straight, yet I couldn't scrunch down more in the seatbecause my knees were already hitting the front seatback.   The convertible top fit tightly and there were no whistles,rattles or wind noise, though it wasn't as easy to put down as theMiata ragtop. The Capri involved a couple more steps than theMiata. Both cars have cloth tops that must be put up and downmanually. But a plastic boot covered the Capri convertible roofneatly, while the Miata canvas cover does not provide such a smoothappearance. Both vehicles offer optional hard tops for cold weathertravel.   The Capri trunk was nicely carpeted and offered space for twogolf bags or a half dozen grocery bags. The rear seat also foldsdown to allow more cargo space.   Ford expects to produce 30,000 Capris annually once productionreaches full speed in the next year. Since introduction inmid-July, more than 4,600 Capris have been sold.   Because the Capri is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports magazinedoes not list owner complaints.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Nov. 24-25</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
