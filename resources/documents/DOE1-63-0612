Todayit provides the state with cost-effective fuel for electrical generationand for thermal energy used in sugarcane processing; tomorrow it willprovide feedstock to produce liquid and gaseous fuels, which will helpmeet Hawaii's transportation energy needs. With optimal growing conditionsyear round and a strong economy based in part on sugarcane and pineapplecultivation, Hawaii is an ideal place to develop fuels from biomass.In November 1984, the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute (HNEI) held theFirst Pacific Basin BioFuels Workshop. The Plan for Action resultingfrom this workshop led to significant new program efforts that addressedthe advancement of biomass research, development, and use. The SecondPacific Basin BioFuels Workshop was held at the Kauai Resort Hotel inKapaa, Kauai, April 22-24, 1987. Before and after the workshop, HNEIconducted field visits to biomass energy facilities and test sites onHawaii, Maui, Oahu, and Kauai. The workshop consisted of presentations,discussion groups, and plenary sessions on growth and yield, conversion,end use, institutional issues, and other topics. The final session focusedon recommendations for a Plan for Action update.</TEXT></DOC>
