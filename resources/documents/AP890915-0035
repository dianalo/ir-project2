The group measured the total Bush said he would like to givestates for law enforcement and prevention and treatment againstlosses in programs for immigration, economic development andjuvenile justice.   According to the group, 43 states would lose federal assistanceequal to more than half their new drug fund allocation under theBush plan.   Of those states, 22 would have losses exceeding estimated gains,as would the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories, thestudy said.   The worst losses would be in California, where cuts would equalnearly four times the amount of money received under the drug plan _a net loss of $150 million.   In Texas, cuts are expected to be twice as much, for a net lossof $25.5 million, the study said. And in the District of Columbiathe cuts are expected to take about 70 percent more out of thebudget than the proposed new funding will put in, for a net loss of$1.1 million, the study said.   For the states, District of Columbia and the territories, thetotal new spending is supposed to be $449 million under the Bushplan, but the cuts in such programs as immigration, juvenile justiceand economic development will total $557 million, for a net loss of$108 million, the study said.   The study did not count the $50 million in Bush's proposal forpublic housing programs because it comes out of an account alreadyearmarked for public housing. The funding request covers the 1990fiscal year.</TEXT></DOC>
