Eleven guerrillas were killed and 11 soldiers were wounded inthe attack in eastern Morazan province, according to a communiqueissued by the Armed Forces Press Office.   The raid lasted two to three hours and appeared to be one of themost successful guerrilla operations in recent months.   Marxist-led rebels of the Farabundo Marti National LiberationFront have fought the the U.S.-backed centrist government fornearly nine years. About 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have beenkilled.   Lt. Salvador Gonzalez said the attack began at 1 a.m. (3 a.m.EDT) with rebels firing mortar rounds and charges of TNT into acommunications post on Avocado Hill, north of Corinto, 120 milesnortheast of San Salvador.   Gonzalez, spokesman for the 3rd Army Brigade, spoke by telephonefrom San Miguel, headquarters for military operations in theeastern third of this small Central American country.   He said the rebels used catapults, similar to those used inmedieval times, to launch explosives into the base defended byabout 50 men. The guerrillas then attacked with rifle fire, he said.   The raid began an hour after the end of a guerrilla-imposed roadtraffic ban that paralyzed most transportation nationwide sinceMonday. In lifting the ban, the rebels called on supporters to stepup sabotage of vehicles that ignored the measure.   The guerrillas also stepped up sabotaging power transmissionlines in several of El Salvador's 14 provinces.   Bus and truck traffic returned to normal during morning rushhour. The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said the ban _ thefifth this year _ was lifted as of midnight Wednesday.   At least three vehicles were burned during the ban, whichreduced bus and truck traffic in the capital by about 70 percent.Traffic on provincial highways was almost completely paralyzed.   Some buses and trucks that operated since Monday covered theirlicense plates trying to avoid reprisals.   The guerrillas blew up about 35 utility posts or high-tensionwire towers after the transport ban began, military sources said.Four eastern provinces were without electricity early Thursdaybecause of overnight sabotage.</TEXT></DOC>
