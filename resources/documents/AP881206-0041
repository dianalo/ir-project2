Monday's verdict awards the money to Suffolk County and couldmake the Long Island Lighting Co. liable for $1.8 billion if thetrial judge certifies the suit a class action on behalf of all ofthe company's ratepayers.   The utility issued a one-sentence statement through its attorneyMichael Lesch, saying the verdict was ``insupportable'' and that thecompany would appeal.   The seven-member U.S. District Court civil jury found that thecompany and a former president, Wilfred O. Uhl, violated theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute by lying tothe state Public Service Commission on three occasions about thecompletion schedule of Shoreham to obtain rate hikes.   The verdict followed a two-month trial of the county's lawsuitagainst the utility. The jury awarded $7.6 million in damages to thecounty for what it overpaid on utility costs because of fraudulentlyobtained rate increases in 1978 and 1984.   That amount is tripled to $22.8 million under the racketeeringstatue. The county had sought up to $72 million in damages.   The jury rejected the county's charges that the utility deceivedthe Public Service Commission in obtaining other rate increases in1975, 1976, 1979 and 1981. It also found no violations by threeother former Long Island Lighting officials who were defendants.   ``I think the jury spoke loud and clearly that Lilco had beenengaging in a pattern of fraud for a decade,'' said KennethMcCallion, the county's lead attorney. ``A verdict in this case hasto send a message to all parties that the fraud engaged in by Lilcohas to be a major factor for those who are considering the fate ofShoreham.''   Last week in Albany, the state Legislature let a deadline passfor approving a plan that would keep Shoreham closed and give theutility 5 percent annual rate hikes during the next decade.   The utility has said that while the plan could be revived, itwould proceed toward licensing the plant.   County Executive Patrick Halpin called the verdict ``a greatvictory for the county and Suffolk's ratepayers.''   According to testimony, the Shoreham plant, 55 miles east ofManhattan, originally had been scheduled to be in operation in 1978for less than $1 billion. Construction was completed in 1985, butthe plant was never opened because of public opposition.   The county said the utility spent $8 billion in the constructionof Shoreham, but the company said the plant cost $5.3 billion.   Originally, the county had wanted to make the suit a class actionon behalf of all Long Island Lighting customers, but Judge Jack B.Weinstein limited the scope of the suit before the trial started.   After the verdict, Weinstein said he would accept a motion askinghim to certify it as a class-action suit. If he granted the request,the utility could be liable for up to $1.8 billion, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
