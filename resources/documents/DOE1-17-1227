Sincefor these systems the Schrodinger equation can be exactly solved, theyare good tool to study the limits of the pure nucleonic description ofnuclei. The recent experimental results impose to take into account thenon-nucleonic degrees of freedom, which are the Meson Exchange Current(MEC) contribution.</TEXT></DOC>
