(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Snappy dressers beware: A too-tightnecktie can make your head swim and vision blur, says the author ofa book on improving health habits.   Ties that lack slack can constrict blood flow to the brain andsensory organs, said Dr. Don R. Powell of the American Institutefor Preventive Medicine.   He cited 1989 research at Cornell University for the necktietip, one of 365 suggestions in his book, ``A Year of Health Hints.''   ``It can be a problem for people who have to use their eyes inan important way,'' Powell said Monday, noting that clear vision iscrucial for computer operators, pilots and surgeons.   Powell suggested buying shirts a half-size bigger in the neck,leaving the top button undone, tying knots loosely and looseningthe tie throughout the day.   He also said ``casual days'' at work, when a tie isn'tnecessary, would help alleviate the health problem and boostmorale. He said his institute has ``casual Mondays'' and ``casualweeks'' and is discussing ``casual summers.''</TEXT></DOC>
