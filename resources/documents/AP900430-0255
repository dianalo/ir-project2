(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Western Union Co., whichpioneered the telegram, on Monday announced a plan to restructure$530 million in debt in an effort to avoid a bankruptcy courtfiling.   Under terms of the plan, the company would exchange up to $530million in principal amount of outstanding debt for new debtsecurities and common stock. Western Union faces a June 15 deadlineto make a $51 million interest payment.   Robert Amman, Western Union's president and chief executive,said in a statement that the plan ``will remove the financialuncertainty clouding our future.''   Amman said the plan would allow the compant to ``move forwardwith continued growth of our electronic messaging and financialservices in markets where Western Union is the acknowledgedleader.''   The company took special charges of $603 million in the firstquarter of 1988 in connection with the planned sale of thecompany's microwave voice-switching facilities.   Western Union has gotten out of the business of providingcommunications facilities to focus on specialized business andconsumer services, but the company has continued to struggle,reporting $32 million in losses in 1989.   Western Union officials told regulators in March that thecompany may have to seek bankruptcy court protection if it cannotmeet its debt interest payments.   In the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Western Union said that without being able to raise additionalfunds, it probably would default on the June 15 payment.   ``This exchange offer would give the company more breathingroom, time to get more focused on operations, which is stillshowing losses,'' said Al Casazza, an analyst who follows WesternUnion for Moody's Investor Service.   But Casazza said that even if the plan is accepted, ``there'sstill a great uncertainty over whether they'll ever be successful.''   Leigh Walzer, an analyst for R.D. Smith Inc., said he was moreoptimistic about Western Union's chances of success if therestructuring goes through.   Under the plan, Western Union also would reclassify outstandingpreferred shares. The plan must first be approved by bondholders.   ``If they get this under these terms, I would bet they would beout of the woods,'' he said.   Western Union said in a March filing with the SEC that if therestructuring is not approved, the company may seek to raise moneythrough a public stock offering or by selling assets.</TEXT></DOC>
