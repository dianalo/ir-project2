The pact represents a potentially broad alliance betweenthe companies that will give Genetics Institute a new sourceof funds and a channel to the Japanese pharmaceutical marketfor a number of its products that are in early stages ofdevelopment. Genetics Institute will share with Yamanouchisome of the potential profits from the drugs but will retainNorth American marketing rights to them.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Development of the bone-growth factors is expected tocost as much as $100 million, most of which will be funded bythe partnership&quot; over the next several years, said GarenBohlin, Genetics Institute's executive vice president. Hedeclined to say precisely how much of the funding would beprovided by each company. The drugs, which aren't expected toreach the U.S. market before the mid-1990s, are beingdeveloped to treat orthopedic, dental and other bonedisorders.   The 50-50 joint venture will own rights to the drugs,Genetics Institute said. The companies will share theventure's proceeds from their sales of the drugs or fromsales by third parties that license rights to the drugs fromthe venture. Genetics Institute, however, will retain notonly North American marketing rights but also world-widemanufacturing rights to the drugs.   The joint venture also will have the right of firstrefusal to develop and commercialize other drugs in Japanthat are now being researched at Genetics Institute, Mr.Bohlin said. He declined to identify the drugs involved, butadded that they &quot;could span any of the areas we're workingin, but aren't quite as broad as everything in our pipeline.&quot;   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, GeneticsInstitute closed at $38, up $1.875.</TEXT></DOC>
