It's not a new position for the majority Democrats; they watchedhelplessly eight years ago as conservative members of their partyprovided the victory margin for President Reagan's across-the-boardtax cut _ an act many Democrats blame for today's budget woes.   Now the issue is cutting taxes on capital gains. And just asDemocratic leaders engaged in a ``bidding war'' in 1980 in aneffort to block Reagan's tax cut, they have been forced to proposetheir own capital gains reduction.   With Congress in recess for a month, there is time for HouseSpeaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,D-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, to turn themomentum and defeat the Bush-backed plan. That ``victory'' stillwould leave Democrats solidly behind a cut in capital gains taxes _just as Bush called for in last year's campaign.   In a Sept. 30 debate with Michael S. Dukakis, Bush declared:``When you cut capital gains ... it's not going to cost thegovernment money, it's going to increase revenues to the federalgovernment and it's going to create jobs.''   The plan, which would cut the 33 percent top tax rate on capitalgains to 15 percent, was assailed by Dukakis as ``a tax cut for thewealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country _ an average of$30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.''   When Bush forwarded his bill to Congress, it was widely endorsedby Republicans but drew little support among Democrats.Rostenkowski said there was no way he would allow Chicagostockbrokers to pay a lower tax rate on their investments thanblue-collar workers pay on their wages _ and it appeared the billwas dead.   But an unusual public change of heart by Rostenkowski revivedthe proposal. Finding it increasingly difficult to put together adeficit-reduction plan because of Bush's opposition to a taxincrease, Rostenkowski announced on June 7 that he would consider acapital gains cut if Bush would get behind some unspecifiedDemocratic tax initiatives.   There was no evidence that Bush budged an inch. But backers of acapital gains cut took the opening, and by the time the panel beganits work, the 13 Ways and Means Republicans and six of the 23Democrats united behind a new proposal.   Unlike Bush's bill, the new plan sponsored chiefly by Rep. EdJenkins, D-Ga., would benefit investors in commercial buildings andtimber. It would reduce the top capital gains rate to 19.6 percentfor two years and then raise it to 28 percent and ``index'' certainassets so that artificial gains created by inflation would not betaxed.   Facing certain defeat, Rostenkowski refused to bring capitalgains to a vote. Foley, calling a cut ``unwise, inequitable andill-timed,'' weighed in with a warning to Bush: drop the push for acapital gains reduction or face the prospect of deadlockednegotiations on 1991 deficit reductions.   A closed caucus of all House Democrats last week confirmed thatalthough well over half the party members opposed a cut, there wereenough dissenters to ensure, with a solid bloc of Republicans, avictory for Bush.   Foley, while opposing a cut in the capital gains tax rate,emphasized that he could consider some sort of ``indexing'' toensure that profits generated solely by inflation would not betaxed.   Rostenkowski quickly came up with an alternative built aroundindexing. It would go further, allowing investors, in times of lowinflation, to avoid tax on 25 percent of the price for which theysell stocks, buildings, timber or other assets held for more thanfive years.   The proposal failed to attract immediately any of the sixdissident Democrats or the 13 Ways and Means Republicans, and thereis no assurance that the other Ways and Means Democrats will goalong when they return to work next month. No matter how theproposal is worded, it still would reduce the tax bite on capitalgains.   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, a Ways and Means member who wants acapital gains cut, noted that dozens of other issues are facing thecommittee: aiding the poor, child care, health care and the like.   ``I'm hoping we don't continue to call this a party issue,''Pickle said. ``The money (from a capital-gains reduction) will beused to finance programs the Democratic party needs and endorses.''</TEXT></DOC>
