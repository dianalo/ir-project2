A NaI (TI) detector coupled toa multichannel analyser (400 channel) was used for the determinationof the uranium content in the cakes. The observed counting rate of the1 MeV gamma-ray emitted by the /sup 238/U in the sample was correctedfor sample self-attenuation. The sample self-attenuation was measuredwith a /sup 65/Zn ({gamma}-energy {similar_to} 1115 KeV) transmissionsource. A calibration factor determined by measuring a standard of knownamount of nuclear material in the same form and geometry as the unknownsample was used to convert the transmission-corrected counting rate togram or percentage of uranium in the weighed sample. Three gamma-raymeasurements were carried out to determine the U-content of the sample:(1) the transmission source alone, (2) the sample alone, and (3) thetransmission source plus the sample. 9 diuranate cakes were then analysedby this method and the results obtained are presented in this paper.For uranium concentrations between 2-21 per cent, relative standard deviations(RSDs) of 0.10-4.50 per cent were obtained for counting times of 1 hr.The transmission technique was also tested on a number of synthetic diuranatecake samples treated as unknowns and the results were found to agreewell with the expected values.
