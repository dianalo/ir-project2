<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-56-0108 </DOCNO><TEXT>A systematic investigation of the base-catalyzed C-alkylation of a low-volatilebituminous coal from the lower Kittanning Seam was carried out to assessthe factors important for the conversion of this 89.3% C (daf) coal intoproducts that could be extracted into pyridine. Although base strengthis significant, the chain length of the alkyl group introduced duringthe reaction is the single most important factor for the achievementof a high, 90%, extractability. Molecular modeling considerations suggestthat the larger alkyl groups disrupt the stacking of aromatic compoundsand render the material soluble. 20 refs., 1 fig., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
