Mr. Murdoch, already the U.K.'s biggest newspaper publisher, said his Australia-based News Corp. agreed to lease three or possibly four channels on a new satellite set for launch Nov. 4. He aims to leapfrog his British rivals in a new European battle for satellite broadcasting. The effort would expand his European TV role significantly and could parallel in scope -- and risk -- his continuing attempt to create a fourth TV network in the U.S.    Mr. Murdoch said European viewers are starved for TV choices. And Mr. Murdoch, who will sell advertising on the channels, accused Britain's commercial TV monopoly of charging &quot;outrageous&quot; advertising rates. &quot;We now feel the opportunity has finally come to do something about it,&quot; he said at a news conference yesterday.    The chance arises because of powerful new satellites that bypass cable systems and networks to beam TV signals straight to consumers' homes. But the technology is risky because a customer must spend at least #200 ($363) for an antenna and converting equipment to receive the signals.    Mr. Murdoch will bypass U.K. licensing procedures by leasing the channels on a satellite owned by a Luxembourg-based company, Societe Europeene des Satellites. Viewers across most of northern Europe will be able to see the English-language programs, including movies and news, but Mr. Murdoch said he would focus initially on Britain.    Robert Maxwell, Mr. Murdoch's archrival in the tabloid newspaper business, disclosed his own satellite plans Tuesday. Mr. Maxwell said he intends to promote existing cable channels directly to British consumers with satellite dishes, in an alliance with British Telecommunications PLC, the main U.K. phone company, and W.H. Smith Group PLC, a retailer with television interests. Together, Mr. Maxwell and the two companies plan to offer six cable channels, including Music Television, a version of the popular U.S. music-video channel, and other channels focusing on movies, sports and children's fare.    The Murdoch and Maxwell efforts could upstage British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd.'s plans to operate a satellite showing its own three channels. British Satellite has raised #222.5 million ($403.4 million) and hopes to begin service in late 1989 -- nearly a year later than Mr. Murdoch. Unlike British Satellite, Mr. Murdoch doesn't plan to charge viewers for watching.    British Satellite's backers include a cross section of such Murdoch rivals as Reed International PLC, Granada Group PLC and Virgin Group PLC. Pearson PLC, publisher of London's Financial Times, put up #30 million to join. News Corp. has a 20.4% stake in Pearson, but Mr. Murdoch didn't discuss the Pearson relationship.    British Satellite said it long expected Mr. Murdoch's challenge, but said it would offer a superior product through the use of a new broadcast standard affording higher sound and picture quality. Mr. Murdoch said British Satellite's technology won't impress consumers because the difference won't be noticeable on existing TV sets.    Mr. Murdoch declined to discuss his venture's total cost, but said News Corp. would invest #10 million in London studios and transmission facilities. He also noted that the company so far has spent #40 million to establish Sky Channel, its existing European cable TV service. The service, transmitted by satellite, is available only to the relatively few European homes with cable. News Corp. will have to spend heavily if it wants to match British Satellite's programming budget, set at #110 million for the first year.    News Corp. plans to use Sky Channel as a channel on the new satellite. But it acknowledges the need to improve Sky's programming, largely American reruns at a minimal average cost of $2,000 an hour. A second channel would show movies, and a third would offer a 24-hour news service. A possible fourth channel would offer round-the-clock sports. Although signals won't be scrambled, he said the company will try to prevent cable operators in Germany and France from relaying the movie channel. </TEXT></DOC>
