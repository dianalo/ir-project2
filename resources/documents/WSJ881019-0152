Michael Dukakis, polishing his appeal to the blue-collar voters whose support he needs, used the eve of the anniversary of last year's stock market crash to blame the Republicans for the 500-point plunge.    With populist rhetoric and a new set of verbal sallies against Vice President Bush, Mr. Dukakis blamed the crash on &quot;Republican policies of borrow and spend and borrow and spend.&quot; Mr. Bush and the GOP administration have done &quot;absolutely nothing&quot; about &quot;curbing the excesses on Wall Street&quot; in the year since the crash, he added.    The confident Bush campaign countered that blaming the crash on the Republicans is &quot;about as meaningful&quot; as accusing them of causing &quot;world hunger or yesterday's rain.&quot;    The Democratic candidate also vowed to end the trade deficit in four years through a combination of expanded markets, better training and education and limited protection for U.S. industries, and he promised to reclaim the five million jobs he says have been lost overseas.    Mr. Dukakis's message was designed to portray Mr. Bush as a passive leader satisfied to let business and powerful interests operate without outside checks. &quot;He's got the flags, he's got the balloons -- and no convictions, no ideas and no plans,&quot; the Massachusetts governor said in a visit to Western Michigan University.    Mr. Dukakis, who has toyed with populist language in the past, turned up the heat yesterday. &quot;George Bush cares about the people on Easy Street,&quot; the governor said. &quot;I care about Main Street.&quot;    This new offensive here in the industrial heartland comes as the Dukakis campaign is fighting a perception that the governor's stumbles in last week's debate led to a sharp decline in his popularity. Although Mr. Dukakis was subdued earlier this week, he was buoyed by the boisterous reception he received here. &quot;We're in a fight for America's future, and you'd better believe we're not going to walk away from that fight,&quot; he vowed.    Behind the scenes, though, the Dukakis campaign was struggling to respond to the Bush blitz.    Democratic media experts were asked by Dukakis strategists yesterday to put together a commercial responding to the six-week-old Bush blockbuster that attacks the governor's prisoner-furlough system in Massachusetts. One media consultant refused to help, saying it was too late to respond. Another experienced consultant, Robert Squier, reportedly agreed to lend a hand.    The Dukakis strategists also were looking for a consulting firm to put together a 30-minute network television show for next Tuesday, but they were having trouble finding anyone who believed it could be done by then.    These experienced Democratic consultants, none of whom has played a major role in the Boston-based Dukakis campaign, generally agree all this work should have been done months ago.    For weeks, Mr. Dukakis has argued that the nation must start exporting products rather than jobs. Yesterday, he took both his rhetoric and his promises further, promising to reduce the deficit by, among other things, giving industries &quot;that have been battered by Mr. Bush's reckless politices&quot; a &quot;breathing space&quot; to &quot;retool with new technologies.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis, who opposed protectionist remedies to the trade deficit in the primaries, has embraced protection for U.S. industries on a limited basis if they agree to modernize.    Mr. Dukakis said the Republican administration sat on the sidelines while the economy was in peril, doing &quot;nothing about the merger mania of speculation, nothing about the ballooning national debt that keeps going up and up, nothing about a $150 billion trade deficit, nothing about our growing dependency on foreign bankers to pay for eight years of Republican deficits.&quot;    Meanwhile, Mr. Bush, continuing his strategy of sticking to the themes that have gotten him the lead in the polls, took his campaign to Fulton, Mo., where Winston Churchill warned in 1946 that an &quot;iron curtain&quot; had fallen across Europe, a speech that helped to mark the beginning of the Cold War.    Mr. Bush called the dividing line between East and West &quot;a rusting curtain&quot; because of the Soviets' economic problems. &quot;It would be far too simple, even dangerous, to conclude, however, that Soviet foreign policy is driven exclusively by economic weakness,&quot; he warned.    Mr. Bush's speech lacked the eloquence of Mr. Churchill's: A sign outside the event read, &quot;Bush is no Churchill.&quot;    Messrs. Bush and Dukakis will be crossing each other's paths over the next few days as they fight for the undecided votes in big Midwestern states where the polls have shown them to be close. Both candidates were scheduled to be in Detroit last night. Then they will flip campaign appearances, with Mr. Dukakis in central Missouri and Mr. Bush in Saginaw, Mich.    ---   Jeffrey H.
