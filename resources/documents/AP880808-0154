(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorneys for PTL founder Jim Bakker haveprotested the sale of his deposition transcript to a newspaper andasked a bankruptcy judge to keep future depositions secret, one ofhis lawyers said Monday.   The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer on Wednesday published excerpts ofBakker's sworn statements to attorneys.   In the Observer story, Bakker said he believed thousands ofinternal PTL documents had been destroyed since he resigned aspresident in March 1987 in a sex and money scandal. Ministryofficials have denied that.   The ministry has been in Chapter 11 reorganization proceedingssince June 1987 and must sell off assets to pay debts.   Bakker attorneys Ryan Hovis and James Toms won a court orderThursday to protect the defrocked minister from the release offurther transcripts. The Observer had purchased the documents fromthe court reporter transcribing Bakker's deposition.   Toms said the Observer obtained about half of 20 hours ofdeposition given by Bakker so far and that about five more hours oftestimony is yet to be given.   In his ruling, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds ordered thetranscript sealed and filed with the court clerk at the federalcourthouse in Columbia.   He noted that neither Bakker nor his attorneys had reviewed thetranscripts before their sale.   The court reporter told Toms she released the transcript aftergetting permission from the bankruptcy trustee's attorney, Toms'motion said.   The lawyer said Monday he thought it unfair to Bakker to releasethe transcripts piecemeal and before they had properly enteredcourt.   ``If you release portions of it, you're releasing it infragments, for one thing, before the whole story is told,'' he saidfrom his office in Hendersonville, N.C.   On Friday, Bakker's attorneys asked Reynolds to clarify hisposition on release of depositions before the process continues.   ``We're going to basically ask him to say he meant what hesaid,'' Toms said Monday.   The Observer said it plans to protest the order, but it is notclear when the bankruptcy court might take up the issue again. Acourt official said Monday the matter had not yet been added to theagenda of the next hearing, which is scheduled for Thursday.   Observer Managing Editor Mark Ethridge III said he believed thestory based on the transcripts was fair, accurate and would notinterfere with justice.   ``It's not as though it alters the truth,'' Ethridge said.   He said reporters frequently buy transcripts of trials beforethey are entered into the court record.   Bakker is preparing to defend himself against a $52 millionlawsuit filed by PTL that charges him with grossly mismanaging theministry, the business he founded but later left afteracknowledging a sexual encounter with a church secretary.   The PTL lawsuit alleges that Bakker and former aide DavidTaggart took millions of dollars from the ministry for theirpersonal use even though they knew PTL faced financial trouble.   On Friday, bankruptcy Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton announced atentative agreement to sell PTL's Heritage USA Christian themepark, satellite television network and 1,700 undeveloped acres for$113 million to a Canadian company, Samoth Capital Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
