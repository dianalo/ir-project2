The diversion is necessary because of chronic funding shortagesin VA hospitals, witnesses told the Senate Veterans AffairsCommittee.   The committee has been examining the Veterans AffairsDepartment's prosthetics and rehabilitation programs for months,conducting its own investigation.   Prosthetics is the term for a wide range of medical devices,including artificial limbs, wheelchairs, bathtub grab bars, canesfor the blind, glasses and hearing aids, and such basic items asstump socks.   Close to 1 million of the nation's 28 million veterans receiveprosthetic devices from the VA at a cost of $100 million each year.Veterans receive them because of injuries received during militaryservice. Poor veterans may receive them even though the disabilitywasn't acquired as a result of service.   According to Thursday's testimony, management of the program isfragmented. One of the problems is that the directors of the VA's172 medical centers control local spending.   Witnesses inside and outside of the VA pointed to a lack ofcentralized funding, a lack of cost accounting, overpayments of upto $1,000 for local purchases, and a lack of inventory control atlocal hospitals as well as the VA's central supply depot in Denver.   Local medical directors ``are trying to make everything happen''with limited funds, forcing them to juggle accounts, said FrederickDowns Jr., VA's director of prosthetics and sensory aids services.   Local veterans tend not to complain too loudly for fear ofgetting even less service, so they resort to making small purchaseson their own, he said. ``They just want to get by.''   But veterans groups said there are real problems:   _The blind rehabilitation center at Westhaven, Conn., has morethan 200 veterans on its waiting list;   _The Minneapolis medical center has only $36,000 in itsprosthetics account for the rest of the fiscal year because $276,000was diverted for operating shortfalls;   _Veterans are waiting up to three months for hearing aids andwheelchairs, 60 days for a simple pair of eyeglasses, the AmericanLegion says.   The VA's Inspector General, Renald P. Morani, said the Districtof Columbia medical center spent $2,300 for a brace that could havebeen obtained for less than $1,400.   Morani's office has conducted numerous audits of the prostheticsprograms and is currently undertaking a new one. Deputy VA SecretaryAnthony J. Principi acknowledged problems and said the VA wouldundertake immediate steps to correct problems outlined by amanagement task force. He also plans to form an advisory committee.</TEXT></DOC>
