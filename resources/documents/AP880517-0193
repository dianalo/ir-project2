SWINTON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Immigration officials ruled Tuesday thatanti-Castro militant Orlando Bosch is a danger to the community andordered him deported, bringing bitter protests from his family.   Bosch, a hero to many in Miami's Cuban exile community, served asentence for a 1968 rocket attack on a Polish freighter here, andwas held 11 years in Venezuelan prisons on an unproven accusationhe bombed a Cuban jetliner in 1976, killing 73 people.   Bosch's attorneys are seeking a stay of the deportation. Ahearing is scheduled Friday before U.S. District Judge WilliamHoeveler. The expulsion also must be reviewed by regionalImmigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Steve Martin inDallas.   INS officials in Washington decided to deport Bosch afterreceiving custody of him Monday from federal parole officials, whohad held him since his arrival from Venezuela in February.   ``They feel he is a threat and a danger,'' Perry Rivkind,Florida INS district director, said Tuesday. ``Today I receivedinstructions from Washington to send him a temporary exclusionnotice. It will be presented to him shortly.''   Bosch's angry daughter, Myriam Bosch, accused the INS ofpersecuting her father.   ``You know why they don't want to release him?,'' she said.``Because they don't want to give him the chance to show he's not amenace to society.''   Bosch came to the United States in the 1960s and lived in theMiami area, joining thousands of other Cubans in flight from FidelCastro's takeover. He is not a U.S. citizen.   The pediatrician-turned-activist was convicted of a 1968 Miamirocket attack on a Polish ship that had done business in Cuba. Hefled the United States while on probation for that crime.   Venezuelan authorities then arrested him on an accusation ofmasterminding the bombing of the Cuban jetliner. He was detainedfor 11 years despite being acquitted by Venezuelan military andcivilian courts, but earlier this year was finally freed to theUnited States. On his arrival here in February, Bosch was takeninto custody for violating parole.   Bosch was turned over to the INS Monday, said Tom Kowalski,Atlanta spokesman for the U.S. Parole Commission.   Bosch is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center insouth Dade County.</TEXT></DOC>
