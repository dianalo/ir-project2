It said the clash occurred in the morning after the guerrillascrossed the border from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula into the westernpart of Israel's southern Negev desert.   It was the first infiltration in nine months from Egypt, theonly Arab country to have signed a peace treaty with Israel.   An Israeli force encountered the guerrillas, gave chase andkilled them all without suffering any casualties, the army said.   It was not known to which organization the guerrillas belonged.They carried five Soviet-designed Kalashnikov assault rifles,grenades, a pistol with magazines, binoculars and wire cutters, thearmy said.   The head of the army's southern command, Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai,told Israel army radio the attack apparently was linked to thesecond anniversary this week of the Palestinian uprising in theoccupied lands.   ``We can assume there is a link between these things. ... Thereis no doubt that organizations which we confront would try to carryout such an attack,'' Vilnai said. He refused to give details ofthe clash.   He said the guerrillas carried at least 50 grenades.   ``This equipment shows they simply meant to kill. Not to arguetoo much, not to carry out a hostage-taking operation, but akilling operation,'' Vilnai said.   Vilnai noted that Israel's border with Egypt was usually quiet.Israel and Egypt signed a U.-S.-mediated peace treaty in 1979 andhave full diplomatic relations.   The last reported infiltration from Egypt occurred March 15,when two teen-aged Palestinian guerrillas were captured near theborder town of Rafah.   Army sources said the guerrillas planned to attack an army baseor patrol in the area.   A year earlier, on March 7, 1988, three Palestinian guerrillaswho infiltrated from Egypt seized a commuter bus near the southerncity of Beersheva. Three civilians were killed and nine reportedwounded. The guerrillas were shot to death when anti-riot policestormed the vehicle.</TEXT></DOC>
