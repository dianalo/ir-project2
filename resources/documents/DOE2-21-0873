Frequently in the past the useof conveyors has been ruled out in steep mining applications but nowthe Scholtz FLEXOWELL belting which can be used at angles up to the verticalwill enable many mines to consider complete belt conveyor systems forthe first time. Applications will include steep conveyors for surfacemines and quarries in order to eliminate the need for expensive and noisyfleets of trucks and the associated requirements to maintain haul roads.A further field is in the use of steep or vertical conveyors in undergroundmines to ensure improved continuity of output in existing shaft systemsor reduced development costs in new mines. The Scholtz company, a memberof the Nokia Group which had sales of about 3.5 billion U.S. Dollarsin 1987, has more than 20 years experience with their FLEXOWELL belts.Over 40,000 units are operating around the world. These are already fullyproven for vertical lifts of over 100 m (328ft) and up to 500 m (1,640ft) is possible. Tonnage ratings of up to 4,000 t/h are achievable. Widespreadacceptance of this technology has resulted in unique and major installationsover the past few years. This paper reviews various applications - fromthe viewpoint of successfully proven vertical lift systems as well asthe maintenance and downtime aspects. 3 refs., 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
