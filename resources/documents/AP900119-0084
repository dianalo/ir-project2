Lawyer Arnold Morelli said Leonard Gates and Robert Draise hadchanged their stories, forgotten key dates and ``bumped intofacts'' during their testimony alleging two company supervisors andpolice directed them to install wiretaps.   ``No corroboration _ nobody supports their stories,'' Morellitold the jury in closing arguments. ``It is all a figment of theirimaginations.''   Morelli also noted that the former employees declined to take``lie detector'' tests, while the company supervisors _ Peter Gaborand James West _ voluntarily submitted to the examinations.   Gates and Draise say the company is trying to cover up that theywere ordered to perform 1,200 wiretaps between 1972 and 1984, atfirst for Cincinnati police and later by Cincinnati Bellsupervisors.   The company denies any involvement with illegal wiretaps, andfiled a defamation lawsuit against Gates and Draise.   Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Fred J. Cartolano planned toinstruct the jury on the law after Gates and Draise completed theirclosing arguments today. Closing arguments in the eight-week trialbegan Thursday.   As he did throughout the trial, Morelli on Thursday emphasizedthe employees' inconsistencies and discrepancies. Morelli saidGates has changed his story three times about which supervisorsupposedly ordered him to tap the phone of President Ford during a1975 visit to Cincinnati.   ``A liar has to have a terrific memory,'' Morelli said. ``Toattempt to establish lies takes a lot of time and a lot of work.They have been inconsistent, and they have contradictedthemselves.''   Gates and Draise are defending themselves in the defamationtrial. Draise told jurors in closing arguments Thursday that theymust find in the employees' favor to prevent companies fromretaliating against whistleblowers.   ``You have the ability to send Bell and other companies amessage: we're not going to stand for it,'' Draise said.   Gates admitted Thursday that his memory about the years ofsupposed wiretaps is hazy, but he said anyone would have troubleremembering such details many years later. He also said CincinnatiBell had only complimentary things to say about him in his workappraisals before he went public with the wiretap allegations.   ``Look through my appraisals,'' Gates told the jurors. ``In 23years, Cincinnati Bell has never called me a liar.''   Cincinnati Bell contends that Gates and Draise lied to getrevenge against the company because Gates was fired in 1986 andDraise in 1979. Cincinnati Bell, its parent, Cincinnati Bell Inc.,and two of the phone company's managers, James West and PeterGabor, sued to challenge the wiretapping claims. Gates and Draisecountersued, saying they were injured because Cincinnati Bellofficials called them liars.   Cartolano on Wednesday dismissed the defamation lawsuit thatGates and Draise filed against Cincinnati Bell. The jury now mustdecide only the original lawsuit the company filed against the twoformer installers.</TEXT></DOC>
