Responding to a report Monday in a trade publication allegingincreased risk, the Navy released a 140-page statistical studyperformed by the Yale School of Medicine that tracked both thein-service and post-service death rates for nuclear submariners.   The study, conducted at a cost of $600,000, was originallycompleted in August 1985 and then updated and revised in April 1987.   The Navy insisted there was no reason to challenge the study'sconclusion that submariners were not placed at higher risk as aresult of their occupation, adding in a statement it would stand bythe work of the Yale researchers.   ``The U.S. Naval Medical Command has reviewed the Yale study, inview of recent news media reports ...,'' the statement said.   ``The U.S. Naval Medical Command finds that there is no basis inthe Yale study to conclude there is any health concern related tocancer rates and submarine service on either attack nuclear-poweredsubmarines or ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarines.''   Navy News and Undersea Technology, a weekly trade publication,reported Monday the Navy's statistical study contained evidencethat sailors who had served aboard nuclear-missile submarines weremore likely to develop cancer than their civilian counterparts.   The publication said the research reported an ``observed'' rateof cancer cases among former missile submarine personnel of 54,compared to an ``expected'' rate for the general population of 39.4.   By contrast, the statistics for sailors who served aboardnuclear-powered attack submarines _ vessels that do not carrynuclear-tipped missiles _ showed the number of cancer deathsprecisely matching the expected rate: 22 versus 22.5.   The publication also quoted Dr. Michael Sheridan, anepidemiologist and biostatistician at Georgetown University, assaying the study utilized procedures that were bound to be biasedin the Navy's favor and to underestimate cancer rates.   The Navy, in responding Tuesday, said the trade publication hadfailed to take account of the fact that all such mortalitystatistics are developed with a range of numbers.   While the numbers cited by the publication are correct, as drawnfrom one table, the observed rate of 54 cancer cases compares to anexpected range of ``26 to 53, based on nationwide averages,'' theNavy said.   ``The Yale researchers found that there were 54 actual deaths,one higher than expected. A small increase such as this may be dueto normal statistical variation in a group of this size.''   The Navy said the Yale researchers themselves had made the samepoint in the study, writing: ``It is not proper to interpret thisStandard Mortality Ratio as statistical `proof' that men on(nuclear missile) submarines are at elevated risk of cancer ...''   The study distributed on Tuesday was originally requested in1974 by Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., and her military affairsassistant at the time, Capt. James Bush, a retired Navy submarineskipper who developed cancer.   Bush, who was treated and survived his cancer, is now anassociate director at the Washington-based Center for DefenseInformation.   Bush has said his interest in pushing the Navy to conduct thestudy was spawned by his own experience and the fact that hepersonally knew 14 former submariners who developed or died fromthe disease, including four from the same missile boat that hecommanded.   Phone calls to Bush on Tuesday to discuss the Navy's responsewere not immediately returned.</TEXT></DOC>
