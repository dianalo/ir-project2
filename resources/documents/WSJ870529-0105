Thepolice don't know the man's family name, only that his firstname was Tony. But they do know who murdered him, and why.   Tony was &quot;executed&quot; by members of the New People's Army, or NPA, the military arm of the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines. He was shot after a &quot;trial&quot; of less than an hour. His crime, according to a witness to his murder, was cattle rustling.    Tony is just one of hundreds of NPA victims to be exhumed from remote and anonymous graves in the past year. With the discovery of each skeleton, local newspapers announce a new &quot;killing field,&quot; a strained allusion to the mass executions in Cambodia in the late 1970s.    But genuine killing fields have been found in the past year. On the southern island of Mindanao, 600 bodies have been unearthed, many of them victims of a six-month killing spree within the rebel ranks that even the NPA admits went too far.    The murders have heightened the NPA's reputation for brutality, which has often been played down by the local and foreign media. The Mindanao murders show that the NPA, when rattled, can dispense random and indiscriminate terror, not merely the &quot;revolutionary justice&quot; it brags about when it kills a corrupt policeman, a local bully or, with less fanfare, anti-communist community leaders.    In the past, Filipinos in many rural areas preferred the disciplined terror of the NPA to the random excesses of the country's military. With the change of government last year, a mild improvement in military behavior and the detection of the Mindanao slaughters, some Filipinos are changing their minds. Diplomats and political analysts say they don't know if the trend presages significant popular resistance to the Communists, or just additional turmoil in the Philippine countryside.    The change in government last year is largely responsible for the hundreds of graves dug up in the past 12 months. While the new government's amnesty and rehabilitation program for returning rebels has had limited success, there has been a flurry of communist defections. One of the first things surrendered rebels do to show their sincerity to the government is to escort the military to a paddy or banana farm to unearth bodies that they helped to &quot;try,&quot; kill or bury.    All across the Philippines, and particularly on the southern island of Mindanao, where the insurgency is most intense, soldiers have been working to identify the NPA's victims. Sometimes it is local hoodlums, at other times it is someone deemed inimical to the communist cause.    But Mindanao's killing fields revealed something very different -- a purge within the NPA ranks.    In late 1985, in the remote province of Agusan del Norte, the military noticed a rash of missing persons, 15 in all, most of them known to have some link to the insurgents. The relatives of the missing accused the soldiers of having &quot;salvaged,&quot; or killed their husbands, sons and daughters -- a telling sign of the distrust that the military inspires. The army denied the accusations.    Then, on Feb. 18, 1986, soldiers stumbled on an NPA camp in the village of Antongalon, Agusan del Norte. There was shooting and the insurgents escaped. The military found seven rebels, bound in chains and recently killed.    Four other rebels, chained but alive, told the military of a purge among the communists in Mindanao that, in its brutality, was unprecedented in the party's 20-year history.    According to a rebel returnee, the insurgents discovered in 1985 that their ranks had been infiltrated for years by agents of the military. The army is reluctant to discuss its infiltration, but military analysts confirm that the military had been uncommonly successful in infiltrating the rebel ranks in Mindanao with paid informers and criminals. It had even placed a spy on the rebel's highest decision-making body on the island.    The discovery threw rebel leaders into a panic and sparked the purge that they dubbed Operation Clean.    Suspected traitors were summoned to political &quot;seminars,&quot; where they were seized, interrogated and tortured. One rebel, according to a military document, &quot;who witnessed the torture and execution at one time of 16 of his comrades, said that the victims were hanged upside down from trees and beaten to death with wooden clubs and crowbars.&quot;    The purge spread beyond the control of the NPA leaders. &quot;They started tearing themselves apart,&quot; says a diplomat. &quot;It was a classic witch hunt. When they doubted one of their comrades, they knocked him off.&quot; Says another diplomat, who monitors the insurgents: &quot;It was wholesale panic, hysteria. A blood lust swept the party in Mindanao.&quot; The military thinks many were killed because of personal feuds.    By January 1986, George Madlos, a senior Communist commander in Mindanao, sent to several fellow rebels a letter -- which was intercepted by the military -- warning that an extension of Operation Clean could isolate the party from the masses.    The purge had become so frenzied that the rebels had all but abandoned military operations. In many areas they had no choice: There were so many comrades being held in chains that rebel units couldn't move freely.    In April, as Operation Clean was winding down, Mr. Madlos wrote another letter stating that wholesale carnage had occurred. &quot;There is a big possibility that there were innocents being killed and tortured. . . . As a result, we ourselves are the ones who destroyed our own force.&quot;    The letter included a chilling invitation to a comrade to come in for questioning in the wake of Operation Clean:    &quot;The responsibility you are going to face before the investigating panel might scare you and raise you to suspicion that you will suffer the same fate as those arrested in your area, tortured and killed,&quot; it reads. &quot;We hope that you still trust us. . . . We aren't as brutal as you believe.&quot;    One thing the NPA doesn't reveal is how many rebels were wiped out. Diplomats say 300 to 400 of the bodies found in Mindanao during the past year may have been victims. And they say the purge devastated the morale of the NPA, estimated by the U.S. government to number about 22,000. Many Communist operatives in Davao went into hiding, and cadres coming from Mindanao are suspected by other NPA members of being informers.    Operation Clean has also confirmed the worst fears of those sympathetic to the cause: that the party is capable of wholesale slaughter. </TEXT></DOC>
