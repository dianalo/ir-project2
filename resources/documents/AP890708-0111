More than $500,000 was paid to reimburse clients of two lawyersaccused of stealing from their clients. Ex-attorney John Flanaganserved a prison term and former lawyer Mark Sampson vanished.   The two-year-old Client Security Board, created in response tothe highly publicized Sampson and Flanagan cases, reports that ithas repaid all but one qualifying client of the two lawyers.   The board generally has received praise for prompt payment ofclaims.   ``The court feels it has been very successful,'' said AssociateJustice A.M. Keith, the Minnesota Supreme Court's liaison to theboard. His comments were echoed by Ralph Peterson, head of the statebar association.   The board's chairman, Melvin Orenstein, a Minneapolis attorney,said Friday that most of the 51 people reimbursed so far have beenpaid in full. Some received only partial payment if they receivedmoney from other sources.   Orenstein said the board still has about half of the $1.4 millionit collected from a one-time assessment of $100 per lawyer, whichthe Minnesota Supreme Court ordered after creating the board. But hesaid the board soon will need more money and is likely to ask for anannual attorneys' fee of about $20.   Sampson, a Fridley attorney, disappeared three years ago afterallegedly taking about $450,000 from clients, reportedly to help payfor an elaborate house.   Sampson is still missing, but 19 of his former clients havereceived a total of $413,000 from the board. Only one claim filedearlier this year is pending.   ``It's too bad that lawyers have to have a board like that,''said Richard Brisbois, who said his family received prompt serviceafter submitting a claim on behalf of his grandmother's estate,which Sampson had handled.   Flanagan, of St. Paul, disappeared also, but was later found inUtah. He was convicted of stealing $415,000 and was released fromprison after serving one-third of a 10-year term for theft.   Flanagan's former clients received $110,000 from the board withthe remainder of their claims collected from other sources, such asbanks which had honored forged checks written by Flanagan.</TEXT></DOC>
