The attorneys also denied that Lowe tried to seduce the girl,who was 16 at the time.   The papers unsealed Wednesday also contend that the teen-agerplanned to blackmail the actor with the videotape showing herhaving sex with him, and include affidavits from friends of LenaJan Parsons of Marietta that say the teen-ager bragged about havingsex with the 24-year-old actor last summer.   The documents say the girl intended to use the videotape toextort $2 million from Lowe.   The affidavits had been filed in Superior Court in Cobb Countyin connection with the divorce of Miss Parsons' parents.   Lowe asked the court to dismiss the civil lawsuit that LenaArlene Wilson filed May 12 on grounds that she lacked standing tosue since she no longer had legal custody of her daughter after herdivorce.   A hearing on the motion is scheduled for June 13.   In one document dated March 30, Lowe's lawyer, Edgar Neely III,said he asked to view the videotape ``for the purpose of providingme with sufficient information to advise my client in an attempt toreach a compromise settlement of Ms. Wilson's claims prior to theinitiation of formal litigation.''   Fulton District Attorney Lewis Slaton has said he is lookinginto the possibility of charging Lowe with exploitation of a minor.   A document filed in support of Lowe's dismissal motion said,``The plaintiff's complaint does not allege and Mr. Lowespecifically denies that he induced plaintiff's daughter to havesexual intercourse with him.''   Another document quotes a neighbor, Amanda Hinson, as sayingMiss Parsons told her about the videotape in August.   ``Jan Parsons came over to my house and told me that she had hadsex with Rob Lowe and to come over and see the videotape of the sexscene,'' the affidavit read. It also said that ``she was going touse the film to blackmail Rob Lowe for two million dollars.''   Another friend, Lela Valerie Smith, was quoted in documents assaying she ``was told by Jan Parsons that she had had sex with RobLowe. ... and that they all took turns filming each other whilehaving sex with Mr. Lowe.''   Miss Parsons, who turned 17 in April, apparently met Lowe at alocal nightclub during last summer's Democratic National Convention.   Lowe's public relations firm issued a statement late Tuesdaysaying Lowe had no comment on the lawsuit ``and he will have nocomment until the matter is resolved.''   Fulton State Court Judge Frank Hull ordered that divorce casedocuments related to the case be released, saying their contents``have now been widely reported.''   Television stations that have broadcast edited portions of thetape have said it depicts the girl and another woman having sex,with Lowe directing them off camera. The stations say the tape alsocontains scenes of the actor and a male companion having sex with athird woman.   Slaton said he has not yet requested an appointment with Lowebut plans to meet with the actor before concluding his criminalinvestigation.   A hearing on motions to dismiss Ms. Wilson's lawsuit againstLowe is set for June 13.   Hue Henry, the Athens attorney representing Ms. Wilson, couldnot be reached for comment after business hours Wednesday; hisoffice telephone was answered only with a recording and his hometelephone is unlisted. Ms. Wilson could not be located by telephone.   But the girl's father told WSB-TV that his daughter neverintended to blackmail Lowe.   ``No, she would never do something like that. She wouldn't wantto be involved in something like that,'' John C. Parsons said.</TEXT></DOC>
