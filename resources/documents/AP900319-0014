Recently released records show that 87 members, including twonon-voting delegates, traveled abroad between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31,1989. Well over 100 staff members also went overseas.   The delegations went to some of the finest cities in Europe, tothe Third World, and in the case of two House AppropriationsCommittee staffers, to Antarctica to study research projects.   Staffers who travel with members said the workload on a trip canvary with the delegation leader.   The staff of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz' House Foreign Affairssubcommittee works on a rotation schedule because their boss wearsthem out.   ``We have a working breakfast at 7:30 a.m., three meetingsbefore lunch, a working lunch, two or three meetings in theafternoon, cocktails with one group and a working dinner withanother,'' said Stanley Roth, staff director of the New YorkDemocrat's subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. ``That's apretty basic day.''   However, one House staff member said staffers refer to somelawmakers as ``WCS'' or ``world class shoppers.''   This source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, recalled amember once asking, ``Why the hell did you allow the meeting to goafter 6 o'clock? The stores are closed.''   The House records show the cost of the trips was at least$971,000 from October through December, but reports still not filedcould push the total to more than $1 million.   Many members flew in first-class commercial seats, while largerdelegations used military jets, maintained at Andrews Air ForceBase in suburban Maryland for federal executives and members ofCongress.   One far-ranging trip last November and December took a HouseArmed Services Committee delegation to Morocco, Egypt, Jordan,Oman, Bahrain and Portugal in 11 days.   The delegation met a king, a sultan and a president. They atepigeon, saw the pyramids and cruised the Nile. But these pleasureswere mingled with hours of embassy briefings, meetings with foreignofficials and banquets.   By the end of the trip, members and staffers ``were saying itwas like the Bataan death march,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder,D-Colo., who organized the trip as chairman of the Armed Servicessubcommittee on military installations.   Schroeder said 18-hour days were the norm on her trip, addingthere were ``no golf clubs ... no tanning clinics. The food wasvery good, but I don't think we ever sat down to a dinner that wasless than three hours long.''   Although Schroeder freely discussed the perks along with theworkload of her trip, lawmakers generally react defensively abouttravel.   Rep. Mervin Dymally, D-Calif., who took three trips from Octoberto December that landed him in Africa, Europe, South America andAsia, responded to an inquiry about his travel by preparing areport on his mission.   Dymally, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee oninternational operations, said he was studying ``diplomaticsecurity, anti-terrorism, construction of new buildings,acquisition of sites, and the controversy surrounding the MoscowEmbassy,'' which was never occupied by U.S. diplomats because itwas found to be filled with listening devices.   Some members were frequent fliers during the last three monthsof 1989.   Rep. Eni F. H. Faleomavaega, the Democratic non-voting delegatefrom American Samoa, went to New Zealand in November to discussfishing issues. He traveled to Jamaica in November to discussCaribbean economic matters. Then it was on to Panama, Nicaragua andEl Salvador in October to assess current events in those countries.   Dymally went to The Gambia, the United Kingdom and France in oneOctober trip, and two weeks later traveled to Venezuela, Suriname,Curacao, Haiti and Guyana. He also went in December to Japan, SouthKorea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.   Not all members' experiences are pleasant.   Schroeder said her delegation complained to Moroccan officialsabout that country's cancellation of a military exercise with theUnited States and the postponement of parliamentary elections.   The delegation, which included Reps. William L. Dickinson,R-Ala., Andy Ireland, R-Fla., and Solomon P. Ortiz, D-Texas, feltlike ``the skunks at the garden party,'' Schroeder said.</TEXT></DOC>
