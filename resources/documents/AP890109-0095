Carlucci is askingCongress to increase defense spending by 2 percent above the rate ofinflation for the next two years in a proposed military budgetlikely to change after George Bush becomes president.   In proposing $315.2 billion in budget authority for 1990, and$330.89 billion for 1991, Carlucci is requesting an increase in StarWars spending authority from $4.1 billion in 1989 to $5.9 billion in1990 and $7 billion in 1991.   Under the proposed defense budget for the fiscal year beginningnext Oct. 1, although $315.2 billion would be authorized, $303billion would actually be spent. The spending authority includesfunding for long-term projects and weapons buying in future years.The lower figure, outlays, includes only the funds to be spentduring the 12 months of the 1990 fiscal year.   The $303 billion in 1990 outlays includes Pentagon spending and$9.2 billion for Energy Department nuclear weapons and researchprograms, and is projected at $4.7 billion above actual spendingduring this fiscal year.   Among the requests likely to be changed by Congress or Bush are$94.6 million in spending authority in 1990 and $124.3 million thenext year for research on a new Navy Anti-Satellite (ASAT) weapon;and elimination of a proposed single-warhead intercontinentalballistic missile, the Midgetman.   In other areas of national security, the Reagan administration isasking for an increase of $5.6 billion, to a level of $8.4 billion,in security assistance programs to other nations. The whopping 200percent jump comes in part because loan repayments from othernations go down next year.   The administration is asking for $3.8 billion for grants toforeign countries _ mostly in the Middle East _ so they can buy U.S.weapons.   Another $3.5 billion is being sought in non-military aid, mostlyfor Central America and the Middle East. The budget messageforecasts the request of additional money for the Contra guerrillasof Nicaragua.   The proposed Pentagon budget also continues production of thenewly unveiled B-2 or stealth bomber, designed to elude enemy radar.The exact annual cost of that program remains classified, althoughthe Air Force announced Dec. 16 that each B-2 would cost $516million, a total of $68.1 billion for 132 planes by 1995, making itthe most expensive plane in the world.   The B-2 program may face trouble following disclosures ofinadequacies in electronic equipment designed to enable newlyacquired B-1B bombers to penetrate enemy defenses.   It is also far from clear whether Bush and Congress will agree tocancel the Midgetman, which would be designed to be fired frommobile trucks. Last year, the Air Force volunteered to drop theMidgetman in favor of a rail-mobile version of the 10-warhead MX, orPeacekeeper.   The Air Force argued that 500 warheads could be deployed on 50Peacekeepers for $10 billion vs. $44.7 billion for the Midgetman.   But Congress restored money for research on Midgetman, arguingthat more missiles would be harder to track and destroy, and that asingle-warhead weapon made more sense under a proposed StrategicArms Limitation Treaty limiting the number of launchers.   Bush was expected to submit a revised version of the budget, andthe retired Air Force general he has named as national securityadviser, Brent Scowcroft, has publicly endorsed the Midgetman overthe MX and has suggested lower levels of funding for Star Wars,formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative.   The active duty strength of the armed forces would increase by5,000 in 1990 to a level of 2,138,300, then decrease the followingyear to 2,134,600.   The force level in the Army and Marine Corps remain the same, at772,000 for the Army and 197,000 for the Marines, that of the AirForce would decline slightly, from 571,000 in 1989 and 1990 to567,000 in 1991, and that of the Navy would grow from 593,000 to598,000 to provide crews for the addition of new aircraft carriersto the current fleet of 13 flattops.   The Navy must postpone its plans for a 600-ship fleet, althoughAdm. Stephen Loftus told reporters that goal could be achievedsometime in the 1990s. The number of ships would drop to 574 nextyear and 571 in 1991 with retirements that include two ballisticmissiles submarines and the conversion of another into a mooredtraining ship in 1990.   One submarine armed with Trident class ballistic missiles is tobe added each year, with 63 Trident II missiles delivered in 1990and 52 in 1991.   The Navy, as expected, will acquire two SSN-688 nuclear attacksubmarines in 1990 and two SSN-21 Seawolf nuclear attack submarinesin 1991.   The budget calls for pay raises of 3.6 percent in 1990 and 3.2percent in 1991 for uniformed military and of 2 percent and 3percent for civilian employees of the Defense Department.   As the number of men and women in active service declines, thenumber in the National Guard and reserves is to increase by 7,600 to1,178,300 in fiscal 1990 and to 1,181,700 the following year.</TEXT></DOC>
