WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   King Baudouin, a devout Catholic,stepped down temporarily today rather than sign into law a billending the country's 123-year ban on abortion.   After relieving the king as head of state, the governmentenacted the abortion bill and asked Parliament to restore him asmonarch at a special session on Thursday.   The highly unusual move, made at the king's request, let thegovernment enact legislation to allow abortion in the first 12weeks of pregnancy and relieved the king of his constitutional dutyto sign into law a bill he strongly opposes. Parliament adopted thebill last week.   The royal suspension came after Prime Minister Wilfried Martens'center-left government consulted with the 59-year-old king, whoinsisted he could not sign the legislation.   The king's powers are largely ceremonial. He has no reallegislative powers but under the constitution he signs into law allthe bills.   In practice, the king also plays an active role behind thescenes, consulting regularly with government ministers. He hasrepeatedly acted to defuse disputes between Dutch- andFrench-speaking political parties, which often are locked inlinguistic disputes.   In public speeches he also has urged Belgium's 6 million Dutchand 4 million French-speakers to be more considerate of one another.   The government made clear King Baudouin insisted on finding acompromise on the abortion legislation.   ``Judging that his conscience did not permit him to sign theabortion bill ... the head of state asked the government and theParliament to find a legal solution in which the need of the goodfunctioning of parliamentary democracy can be reconciled with theright of the king not to act in violation of his conscience,'' itsaid in a statement.   The statement said the royal suspension was legal under theconstitution, which provides for the removal of the monarch if heor she is deemed to be ``in the impossibility'' of executing hisfunctions.   That clause had only been applied once before.   In 1940, King Leopold III, Baudouin's father, was suspendedafter he was taken prisoner by Nazi Germany.   After the war, Leopold could not return home because of acontroversy over his wartime conduct. His brother, Prince Charles,became regent and was succeeded by King Baudouin in 1950.</TEXT></DOC>
