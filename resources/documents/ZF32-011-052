CunninghamandM;Vendors of low-end, entry-level RISC workstations are cutting prices acrossthe board.andP;  Advances in chip technology are providing workstations with morepower per dollar, which makes RISC a better buy for newcomers to the marketand allows veteran RISC users to equip their offices with more workstations.andM;But whether buyers are new to the market or have been using RISC platformsfor years, the criteria by which they make buying decisions are the same:price/performance, vendor dependability and support, high performance onrelevant benchmarks, and compatibility with existing applications andnetworks.andM;Bernie O'Connor is a workstation conversion project manager with SASInstitute Inc., a software manufacturer in Cary, N.C.andP;  His company recentlypurchased 150 Series 700 Model 720 workstations and servers fromHewlett-Packard Co. (HP).andP;  O'Connor said price/performance weighed heavily inhis buying decision.andM;&quot;We chose these particular machines because they are the fastest workstationsaround,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;We develop software across many platforms, so we buy RISC workstations froma number of vendors.andP;  The HP workstations have the best throughputcapability&quot; of all the workstations SAS uses, O'Connor said.andM;High-speed performance is key to productivity, he added, because &quot;the lessamount of time spent waiting for compiling to finish, the better.&quot;andM;To help him compare RISC workstation performance, O'Connor examinedSPECmarks, benchmarks that test different performance aspects of theworkstation.andM;&quot;Primarily we are developing software with the RISC machines, so we looked ata SPECmark suite that focused on the CPU and also at tests that applied tothe development work we do,&quot; O'Connor said.andM;Testing a RISC workstation for its performance with existing applications isparamount, according to O'Connor, who advises buyers to run theirapplications on a workstation before buying it.andM;&quot;All other measurements [of performance], such as mips, don't really help ifthe product doesn't perform well with your own applications,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;After that, try and look for a product that has growth possibilities,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;With the Model 720, there are upgrades available that give you aboost in power with an add-in card.andP;  We want the maximum upgradabilitywithout having to install a whole new box.&quot; When Consumer Health ServicesInc. decided to purchase RISC workstations two years ago, its primary concernwas buying from a reputable vendor, said Barb Kostanick, director of MIS atthe Boulder, Colo., company, which matches patients with doctors anddentists.andM;&quot;It's important to know who the [vendors] are, where they are and that theywill be there tomorrow,&quot; Kostanick said.andM;Kostanick decided to purchase Sun Microsystems Inc.'s SPARCstations andSPARCservers.andP;  From her experience in choosing a RISC workstation, sheadvises potential buyers to find the product that best fits theirconfiguration.andM;&quot;Figure out what characteristics are important to your set of applications,&quot;she said.andP;  &quot;A really fast CPU doesn't provide a lot of benefit if the realbottleneck is the disk capacity or I/O throughput.andM;&quot;In our case, a database server needed to have the right combination of fast,large-capacity disks, lots of memory and an efficient network.andP;  So for us,going from 20 to 60 mips wouldn't mean that much.&quot;andM;Kostanick was looking for a sophisticated windowing system to meet herdevelopment needs, and Sun's products provided this feature, she said.andM;By choosing SPARCstations and SPARCservers, &quot;we have traded off extra CPUprocessing and graphics capabilities that aren't provided at the low end, butthe products give us the tools and the operating system to build databaseapplications,&quot; she said.andM;Performance was also an important consideration, she added, because anincrease in performance can save time and money.andM;&quot;The speed we get out of the workstations, combined with Sybase Inc.'sdatabase software, allows us to have a fast response time,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;Thatmeans our users who are answering customer calls can hit the return key andget answers right away.andP;  The end user avoids having to say to a customer,`Just a minute while I pull up the information.'&quot;andM;The SPARCstations' high performance has also allowed Consumer Health Servicesto eliminate a third shift.andP;  By replacing terminals with the RISC machines,users no longer have to take turns sharing the processing power of a server.andM;&quot;With RISC, we can do things during the day that previously had to be done inthe dark of night,&quot; Kostanick said.andP;  &quot;Instead of five users bogging down themain workstation, the data now can be worked with locally and then loadedback over the network.andP;  This is because the SPARCstations have movedprocessing right to the desktop.&quot;andM;Mary Williford, administrative assistant/comptroller for the HousingAuthority for the city of Phenix City, Ala., ran out of storage space in herprevious computing environment and turned to IBM's RS/6000 320.andP;  She chose torun her accounting applications on the RISC platform because she wanted theversatility of a Unix-based system, the speed of the RISC processor andenough storage space to bank the activities of the housing authority.andM;&quot;We had been using minis for 11 years, and it was time to update,&quot; she said.andO;&quot;With our previous system, every six months we had to dump data.andP;  The RS/6000is eight times larger in storage space.&quot; IBM's RISC machine has also savedresources, according to Williford.andP;  &quot;We have saved money on maintenance andhave saved time because the RS/6000's response time is so fast,&quot; she said.andM;Mark Filidei, a senior technical associate at SAM Technology Inc., a medicalresearch company in San Francisco, said his company purchased Tatung Scienceand Technology Inc.'s COMPstation 25.andP;  Compatibility was the top prioritybecause the firm wanted to network the workstation with Sun SPARCstations.andM;&quot;We wanted to do color visualization, to run software for image processingand to do graphics, so we needed a product that supported color and thatcould run X Windows,&quot; he said.andM;The Tatung workstation's selling points were its price and its 19-inchmonitor, but Filidei was most impressed with its support of Sun's Solarisoperating system.andM;When deciding which product to purchase, &quot;a system that comes with Solarisinstead of some proprietary operating system was a big advantage,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;This way we could network together the Sun and Tatung workstations.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
