Secord filed a request earlier this week for the diaries and awide array of other material, prompting objections from the officeof independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.   Associate independent counsel Reid Weingarten complained thatthe request was far too broad and U.S. District Court Judge AubreyRobinson agreed, telling Secord's lawyer, Tom Green, that ``youhave asked for everything under the kitchen sink.''   ``I tell you he is not getting the Reagan diaries,'' Robinsonsaid of Secord's request.   Green did not press the issue of the diaries, but said Secord isentitled to material showing a number of covert activities he wasengaged in on behalf of the Reagan administration.   One of 12 criminal charges against Secord is that he conspiredto pay illegal gratuities to former National Security Council aideOliver North. The gratuities were to encourage North to continue inhis NSC post so that Secord would continue to receive business inconnection with secretly resupplying the Nicaraguan Contras and theadministration's Iran arms initiative.   Green said he is entitled to show the extent of the relationshipbetween North and Secord and to try to prove that if gratuitieswere paid, the reason had nothing to do with the Contras or Iran.   Green promised to try to narrow his request for documents bynext Wednesday.   Separately, former national security adviser John Poindexter,facing trial in the Iran-Contra scandal next year, has said heplans to subpoena diaries of both Reagan and President Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
