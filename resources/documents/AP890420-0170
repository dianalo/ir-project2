As Bush weighed what to include in his package, a group ofRepublican lawmakers urged him to concentrate more on criminalsthan gun control.   Bush met with the group seeking ideas on what should result fromhis administration's review of uses of assault weapons, which haveproliferated among street criminals and drug dealers.   The lawmakers urged him to look beyond new regulation of weaponsand focus instead on construction of prisons and incarceration ofcriminals to deal with ``a national crime emergency,'' said Sen.Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who was joined in the meeting with Bush bySens. James McClure, R-Idaho, and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Rep.Bill McCollom, R-Fla.   Bush told reporters that he was talking to ``a wide array ofpeople on this.''   He said he had reached no decision yet on what to do aboutassault weapons, but added, ``Our package will be _ I guarantee itwill include more on law enforcement.''   ``I guarantee Bill Bennett will be totally on board,'' he addedin reference to his drug policy coordinator who is reported to haveurged stricter controls on semi-automatic weapons.   Bush spoke highly of an opinion he had sought from the head ofthe conservative Heritage Foundation as to how to balance thepublic's concerns about violent crime with the rights oflaw-abiding gun owners. But Bush did not say specifically what heliked about it.   ``He called Ed Feulner up and asked him for his thoughts,'' saidHeritage spokesman Herb Berkowitz.   The spokesman said only that the memorandum in response ``triedto walk a careful, fine line between our constitutional and civillibertarian views'' and the need to address the crime issue.   Bush raised the ire of some gunowners in mid-March when heannounced suspension on imports of semi-automatic assault rifles sothat the administration could review whether they were being usedonly for sporting purposes as is required by law. No similar ban onsales of domestically manufactured weapons, many of which arevirtually identical to the imports, has been implemented.   Gun control advocates are pushing for an expansion of the ban tothe domestic market, citing an escalation in street killings anddeaths of innocent bystanders. But opponents argue that such actionwould impede the rights of law-abiding hunters.   Specter, after meeting with Bush, said he anticipates thepresident will come out with ``a major crime initiative in thecourse of the next several weeks.''   The crime package is expected to include provisions on assaultweapons.   In the meantime, Bush is soliciting opinions from a wide varietyof sources, said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.   ``He's reaching out and talking to a lot of people on this issuewhile the review is going on,'' she said. The review is beingconducted by the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobaccoand Firearms. The agency has distributed a questionnaire to avariety of gun owners, organizations, manufacturers and gun-controladvocates, said Ms. Glen.   ``The standards that are set up in existing law about import are`suitability for sporting purpose.' And we're being very carefulhere, but we're gong to make a determination using that as astandard,'' Bush told reporters.   Various congressional bills in the works deal with gun controlissues.   Specter said he is confident a definition can be developed thatwill separate assault weapons from legitimate semiautomatic huntingweapons.   But McClure said he does not believe that is possible.   He is proposing legislation to require a criminal-record checkof gun purchasers, but he does not favor requiring any waitingperiod to conduct the check. He said a nationwide computerizedsystem must be set up using law enforcement data that gun sellerswould have access to.   Gramm, Specter and McClure said they advocated a heightenedemphasis on prison construction and alternative jail ideas. Grammsuggested using the National Guard for construction of temporaryprisons on military bases.</TEXT></DOC>
