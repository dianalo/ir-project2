(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The judge preparing for a custody battleover frozen embryos says he's reminded of the classic Scopes``monkey trial'' that thrust another small Tennessee court under anational microscope 64 years ago.   Circuit Court Judge W. Dale Young said the custody case weighsso heavily on his mind that he reread ``Six Days or Forever,'' RayGinger's account of the 1925 Scopes trial in Dayton, in which theteaching of evolution was attacked successfully.   That trial drew national attention as famed attorneys ClarenceDarrow and William Jennings Bryan squared off.   ``There's not a day goes by that I don't think about the caseand what the issue will be,'' Young said of the custody battlebetween Junior Lewis Davis and Mary Sue Davis. The trial isscheduled for Aug. 7.   ``Never in my wildest dreams did I think hearing any lawsuit inthis court would attract the attention of more than 12 jurors andthe parties,'' he told The Knoxville Journal in an interviewpublished Monday.   Young said he mostly hears cases involving domestic matters,civil suits, minor injury and malpractice. His 65-seat courtroomprobably won't be able to hold the reporters, spectators andlawyers expected for the Davis case.   Davis obtained a court order temporarily barring his wife fromhaving seven in-vitro fertilized eggs implanted for pregnancy. Hesaid the embryos are joint property and that implanting them wouldviolate his right to decide whether to become a father.   His wife has said she considers the embryos her best chance tobecome a mother. Her attorney has argued that Davis decided tobecome a father when he participated in the test-tube baby program.   Young, a soft-spoken man with an easy smile, said he won't letthe national attention affect his decision.   ``We're going to do it in a professional manner,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
