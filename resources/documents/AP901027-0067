(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The California gubernatorial campaignis rushing into its final days on a tide of negative advertising,as Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson jockeyfor the lead in the neck-and-neck race.   Feinstein is lashing out at Wilson's record in Congress, whileWilson blasts Feinstein for negative campaigning in her attempt tosucceed retiring Gov. George Deukmejian.   A new Feinstein ad describes how Wilson was wheeled into theSenate on a gurney after a 1985 emergency appendectomy to cast thedeciding vote to freeze Social Security benefits.   The audio portion of the ad has Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,R-Kan., quipping that Wilson votes better ``under sedation.''   Wilson calls the ad ``the ugliest and most mean-spiritedcommercial of 1990.'' His campaign describes it as ``a sign ofdesperation'' by Feinstein.   Wilson's commercials, meanwhile, feature segments of earlierFeinstein commercials accompanied by news stories describing themas fraudulent and dirty.   The Los Angeles Times poll reported Feinstein ahead by 41percent to 39 percent in September and Wilson overtaking her for a42-41 lead in early October.   Mervin Field's California Poll reports a 47-42 Wilson lead,compared with 45-42 in September, while pollster Steve Teichnerfound a 37-30 Wilson lead in mid-October, compared with 37-35 inearly October.   President Bush was in California last week to campaign forWilson, but Wilson was in Washington as Congress put the finishingtouches on the budget-deficit reduction package.   Wilson, who won re-election to the Senate in 1988, had beenharshly criticized by some for campaigning at home while Congresshad unfinished business.   There have been no major issues in the campaign to clearlydifferentiate the candidates.   As a result, issues such as Wilson's attendance record in theSenate and Feinstein's endorsement four years ago of controversialformer state Chief Justice Rose Bird have taken on significance inthe campaign.   Both candidatss have tried to portray themselves as politicaloutsiders despite Wilson's 24 years as a state legislator, mayorand U.S. senator, and Feinstein's 20 years as San Franciscosupervisor and mayor.   It's been a campaign of limited candidate appearances and fewmajor speeches but endless television commercials and faxed pressreleases magnifying small differences and manufacturing otherdifferences where none exist.   They've battled inconclusively over who is most opposed tohiring quotas, most supportive of law enforcement and the deathpenalty, most dedicated to abortion rights and most concerned aboutthe environment.   Wilson and Feinstein say raising taxes would be a last resort,but both have refused to take a no-new-taxes pledge, which is asignificant acknowledgement of the dire fiscal problem the nextgovernor faces.   They do disagree on which taxes they might raise, with Wilsonleaning to a sales tax increase and Feinstein to a higher topincome tax bracket.   Polls report that the historic significance of Feinstein's bidto become the state's first woman governor has faded as a campaignfactor as voters have sorted themselves out more along traditionalparty lines.   ``This race has reshaped itself, not into one about history(whether to elect a woman governor), but in rather traditionalterms - liberals vs. conservatives and a battle for themiddle-of-the-road voters,'' said pollster Teichner.   ``Historically, when elections break down to this level,Republicans win,'' he said.   Wilson's narrow lead appears to be based more on voters' secondthoughts about Feinstein than positive support for Wilson.   ``I'm not sure this was ever Wilson's to win,'' said Teichner.``It's hers to lose. It's her vote that has been the volatilevote.''</TEXT></DOC>
