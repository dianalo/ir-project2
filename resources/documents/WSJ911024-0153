The department's Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration yesterday reclaimed partial regulatoryauthority over North Carolina employers, in the wake of afire early last month that killed 25 poultry-plant workers inHamlet.</LP><TEXT>   North Carolina Labor Commissioner John Brooks has beenlargely uncooperative with OSHA, refusing to voluntarily signa new agreement that would permit the federal agency to sendin enforcement officers, Labor Department officials said.   In Raleigh, N.C., Mr. Brooks said that he would prefer thestate to handle additional inspections but that he welcomesfederal assistance &quot;to better protect North Carolinaworkers.&quot; He said he refused to amend the state OSHA planbecause he won't &quot;be a party to any effort to allow thefederal government to unilaterally dismantle&quot; the stateprogram. The state's budget is lagging because the federalLabor Department hasn't allocated North Carolina's share ofOSHA money appropriated by Congress, he added.   North Carolina is one of 25 states and U.S. territoriesthat regulate worker health and safety under OSHA-approvedplans. In other states, OSHA regulates directly. And NorthCarolina is one of four states that haven't sign amendedagreements that bolster OSHA's ability to enforce workersafety and health requirements, according to Gerard Scannell,assistant labor secretary for OSHA. He said the agency woulddispatch 14 of its federal inspectors to North Carolina, andcould send more later.   Under its selective federal enforcement, OSHA will handleany new worker health or safety complaints and those referredto it by state officials. The agency also will monitor stateinvestigations of worker fatalities and catastrophes, whichinclude hospitalization of at least five workers or anysignificant mishap such as a building collapse.</TEXT></DOC>
