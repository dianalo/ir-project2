Gen. Vigleik Eide said Tuesday that the Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk,in a joint venture with Toshiba Machines Co. of Japan, exportedcomputerized control systems for milling machinery that allowed theSoviets to speed up their production of silent submarinepropellers. The general said the state-of-the art technology wouldmake it more difficult to detect the vessels.   He made the statements at the trial of Bernard John Green, aBriton who was the sales manager at Kongsberg and who signed thecontracts that violated Western export regulations to East bloccountries.   Green, who has lived in Norway since 1975, pleaded innocent tocharges of lying on the export licence application for the sale. Heargued that the sale, completed between 1983 and 1985, was acollective decision by the company. Green, 50, faces a maximum2{-year prison term if convicted.   Eide said the technology enabled the Soviets ``to more quicklyequip old and new submariness with such propellers. From 1984 to1987 the Soviets produced 50 propellers with low noise level.   ``This weakened our possibilities of detecting subs and reducedour capability of drawing the right military conclusions in timesof crisis. Norway's security was damaged,'' Eide said.   Norway is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization andof the Paris-based Coordination Committee for Multinational ExportControl (COCOM), which regulates trade with the Soviet bloc.   The Norwegian-Japanese joint venture involved the export ofmilling machinery with nine axes, which violated COCOM regulationsthat only allowed export of two-axes machine tools.   Oeyvind Bjoerke, who developed high-tech data systems for theNorwegian company, told the court he knew the sale violated COCOMrules and that he discussed it with the company employees.   But Bjoerke said the Soviets could have acquired similartechnology from other sources.   ``They would not have gotten the very best equipment, but otherequipment would not have prevented them from producing the silentpropellers they needed. They may just have needed a little moretime,'' he said.   When the Toshiba-Kongsberg deal was disclosed last year it put astrain on U.S.-Norwegian relations, and Prime Minister Gro HarlemBrundtland apologized to President Reagan.   At the time of the sale, Norway had no law to punish those whoviolated COCOM rules, but Parliament imposed stricter controls lastyear.</TEXT></DOC>
