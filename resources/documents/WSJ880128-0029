The ratio of retail inventories to sales &quot;has rocketed in the last few months&quot; to a 20-year high, says Norman Robertson, chief economist of Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh. Commerce Department figures show business inventories grew at a $58.3 billion annual rate in the fourth quarter. That could reflect retailer stockpiling of imported goods or the increased difficulty of selling imports at higher prices. But many economists fear that the buildup comes from slowing consumer spending and that recession and layoffs will follow.    Confusing the picture is the healthy level of manufacturing inventories. A lower dollar is boosting exports and helping the industrial sector, says Gregory Gieber of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. He thinks this will &quot;offset the weakness of the consumer sector.&quot; But H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co., says exports can't absorb enough of what the U.S. is producing. &quot;We are pumping out a lot of goods that no one is going to buy.&quot;    The recession will be a mild one, says Mr. Heinemann, predicting a recovery beginning by the third quarter.    SHORTS AND CULOTTES offer women hemline alternatives this spring.    &quot;The short skirt is still going to be No. 1,&quot; says retail consultant Arthur Britten. But designers are also offering women the shorter look with a bit more modesty. Donna Karan showed culottes in her spring line. &quot;They are easier to move in,&quot; says Patti Cohen, fashion director at Donna Karan. Ralph Lauren offers two silk suits with shorts ending just above the knee. &quot;You could wear some of the things to the office,&quot; says Jennifer Riegel, spokeswoman.    Pants also gain importance as women seek alternatives to short skirts. This year's look: wider pants legs and softer lines. &quot;Professionally, it will be acceptable if it is an ensemble,&quot; says Joe Meli of Ronni Heller. He expects more pants in the fall collection. But designers say they haven't abandoned the longer skirt and plan to include it in their fall lines as one option. Some say it may even make a comeback. &quot;The long skirt may be stronger than it has been for a while,&quot; says Mr. Meli.    COLLEGE ADMISSIONS get tougher as applications flood in.    Applications at Brandeis University are running 6% ahead of last year, the highest ever. Oberlin College says fall freshman applications will be up 10% over last year's record 3,933. University of Pittsburgh is 16% ahead of last year. The result: higher admission standards and more students rejected, says Betsy Porter, Pitt's director of admissions. Test scores are on the rise at University of California, Los Angeles, with the average freshman SAT score at 1,117, up 30 points from 1986.    Aggressive recruiting, prompted by a declining high-school population, is one reason. University of Southern California sponsors events at hotels across the U.S., rather than rely on college fairs. To lure students, Case Western Reserve University mailed 20,000 &quot;Sounds Like Cleveland&quot; audio tapes with excerpts from a Browns football game, the Cleveland orchestra and ballet.    Many students respond by applying &quot;early decision,&quot; thereby agreeing to attend if accepted. Such applications are up 35% at Brandeis.    REPATRIATED PRODUCTION: Beech Aircraft says that by mid-1989 its Beechjet will be manufactured entirely in Wichita and Salina, Kan., instead of using major parts from Japan. The move insulates the Beechjet from currency fluctuations, says Max Black, president.    A VACCINE SHORTAGE caused by liability worries is leaving U.S. travelers to Asia unprotected against the sometimes-fatal Japanese encephalitis, say two doctors from the Medical College of Wisconsin. The Japanese maker halted shipments in June.    CHECK ERRORS may be costing restaurants some $4 billion a year, say two Cornell University professors who surveyed restaurants in 138 cities. More than one check in eight was incorrect, with 70% of errors resulting in undercharging.    MORE AMERICAN COMPANIES may become tenants in their own buildings.    Popular in the early 1980s, the real-estate sale-leaseback is making a comeback. Use of the technique -- where corporations sell real estate to third parties and then lease it back -- &quot;is going to explode later this year,&quot; says Jay Messer of American Property Fund, Miami. He says sale-leaseback inquiries are running 50% ahead of last year. Real-estate investor Robert Sheridan, Chicago, has seen five companies eye sale-leasebacks in the past three months. &quot;I see it as an increasing trend,&quot; he says.    The technique is &quot;another form of equity financing,&quot; says James Noteware of Laventhol andamp; Horwath. &quot;And in a low stock market it is probably less costly to do it by selling real estate.&quot; Also fueling the trend is a new accounting rule that requires all unconsolidated subsidiaries -- typically the place where corporate real estate is held -- to show up on the corporate balance sheet.    Manufacturing efficiency means some companies lease back only part of their buildings, says Mr. Sheridan.    BRIEFS: Hair stylist Lance Lappin in New York offers a 30% discount to any Wall Streeter who brings in his &quot;pink slip.&quot; . . . Yellow ties are on their way out, says Field Brothers menswear stores, with pink and red the new &quot;power colors.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
