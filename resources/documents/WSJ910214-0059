Now it can't make any of themotorcycles it wants to sell.   Harley's first strike since 1974 has halted the momentumat the Milwaukee company, which in recent years has breezedpast problems that plagued other companies -- from industryslowdowns to economic recession and escalating gas prices.</LP><TEXT>   Efforts to end the walkout that began Feb. 4 at thecompany's York., Pa., plant continued late yesterday. Afederal mediator met with negotiators for Harley and theInternational Association of Machinists, which represents the1,421 striking workers.   Each day of lost work means 275 motorcycles that can't bemade -- or sold. With the current model year sold outalready, neither Harley-Davidson nor its dealers have a bigbuffer of inventories to insulate them from the effects ofthe shutdown.   Although its recreational vehicle unit has suffered fromthe recession and high gas prices, Harley's motorcyclebusiness has continued its long string of earnings andmarket-share increases that began in the mid 1980s.   Chick Hancock, owner of Chick's Harley-Davidson inAlbuquerque, N.M., says dealers have one reaction to thestrike: &quot;God, please get this thing over.&quot; He says a few ofthe bikes his customers ordered are sitting, uncompleted, onthe York assembly line.   Daniel J. Kapusta, an analyst at Robert W. Baird andamp; Co. inMilwaukee, figures the strike costs the company $1.5 to $2million in sales a day. If the strike is short, he reckonsthat can be made up with even more overtime, and possiblyproduction during the two weeks of a normal shutdown later inthe year.   But that might not be so easy. Overtime is one of theissues in the conflict, the union says, along with wages andinsurance. The shutdown later in the year is used forretooling, and making motorcycles at the same time couldprove cumbersome. Ways to make up the production shortfallmay have to be settled in negotiations.   The last strike at Harley's York factory was in 1969, whenthe company was owned by AMF Inc., and there was anotherstrike in 1974 in Milwaukee by members of another union. Thegroup of managers that bought Harley from AMF in 1981 andtook it public five years later has cultivated an image as acompany that knows how to work with its employees.   &quot;Evidently, they didn't mean York,&quot; says Eric Burkey, amember of the strike committee at IAM lodge 175.   Richard F. Teerlink, the company's chief executiveofficer, acknowledges that with the strike, Harley's vauntedemployee involvement philosophy &quot;hasn't worked assuccessfully as it should have.&quot; The test, he says, will comeafter the conflict is settled. &quot;The only way Harley hassucceeded is by getting everyone pulling in the samedirection,&quot; he says.   The walkout has already led the company to lay off 398 of774 employees at its manufacturing operations in Milwaukee,where it makes engines and transmissions for the Yorkfactory. And Harley warns that if the strike continuesthrough this week, it will lay off another 41 workersstarting Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
