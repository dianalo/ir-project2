Earnings declines in the quarter were 18% for Exxon Corp., 55% for Atlantic Richfield Co. and 58% for Amoco Corp. Unocal Corp. and Amerada Hess Corp. both posted modest profits, reflecting the plunge in oil prices since late 1985.    Last year &quot;was a highly unsettled year in world oil markets,&quot; said Exxon's chairman, Lawrence G. Rawl. &quot;Crude prices dropped precipitously during the (1986) first quarter, and surplus capacity and excess supplies were in evidence during much of the year.&quot;    Operating earnings for almost all oil companies during 1986 declined &quot;across the board,&quot; added Paul Mlotok, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc.    Nevertheless, Exxon's $5.36 billion in full-year net income boosted it to first place among U.S. corporations in terms of net income, passing last year's leader, International Business Machines Corp., which recently posted 1986 net income of $4.79 billion.    Looking ahead, analysts expect crude oil prices to improve this year, averaging about $18 a barrel, compared with about $15 last year, assuming that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' current production agreement holds. As a result, earnings from the exploration and production sectors of the business are expected to improve. In addition, most oil companies will enjoy the benefits this year from the industry's restructuring that resulted in heavy charges in 1986.    But these improvements may not be enough to offset deteriorating results from the refining and marketing sector of the oil business, which eroded sharply in the fourth quarter. This segment is expected to deteriorate further.    Major integrated oil companies, whose earnings were buoyed by profitable refining and marketing operations in the first half of last year, will earn less this year, said Barry Good, analyst for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. But he said the smaller U.S. oil companies more oriented toward producing than refining are likely to generate slightly improved earnings this year.    Exxon Corp.   Exxon said fourth-quarter net income fell 18% including a large one-time gain, while quarterly operating earnings tumbled 47%.    A one-time gain of $495 million, mostly from the sale of the corporate office building in New York and the company's Reliance Electric operations, helped buoy results. Earnings before special items slipped to $980 million, or $1.36 a share, from $1.84 billion, or $2.49 a share.    Quarterly revenue skidded 23% to $18.84 billion from year-earlier levels of $24.34 billion.    &quot;World crude prices rose modestly in the fourth quarter, but the improvement didn't counter the substantial deterioration in prices since the fourth quarter of last year,&quot; said Exxon's chairman Mr. Rawl.    Total capital spending of $7.21 billion last year was down 33% from 1985. Exxon said it expects to reduce spending further this year, to $6.5 billion.    Full-year net rose 10%, but earnings before special items declined 8.4%. Revenue last year fell 18% to $76.25 billion from $92.87 billion.    Earnings from exploration and production businesses during the fourth quarter were significantly lower than year-earlier levels. And profit from the refining and marketing operations, which earlier in the year helped to offset the poor showing in the production segment of the business, declined sharply in the fourth quarter as the rise in product prices lagged the increase in crude prices. Earnings from U.S. refining and marketing operations fell to $17 million from a year-earlier level of $84 million.    Atlantic Richfield Co.   Atlantic Richfield, based in Los Angeles, said the impact of lower crude oil prices was mitigated by a corporate restructuring that cut operating and exploration costs.    Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook said: &quot;Since the end of the year, we have seen an improvement in crude prices. We believe that the worst may be over and that 1987 results will reflect more fully the benefits of our restructuring.&quot;    Sales and other operating revenue fell 32% in the fourth quarter to $3.72 billion from $5.45 billion a year earlier. For the year, sales and operating revenue fell 33% to $15.09 billion from $22.49 billion in 1985.    The fourth quarter in both years included several nonrecurring items. In 1986, the quarter included an after-tax benefit of $62 million from oil and gas asset sales and an $18 million benefit from new pension accounting rules. Also in the quarter were after-tax charges of $35 million from the reduction of investment tax credits retroactive to Jan. 1, 1986; of $24 million from the write-down of Arco's agriculture and biotechnology businesses; and of $18 million to restructure Arco Chemical Co.    In the 1985 fourth period, Arco took a $164 million after-tax charge to settle claims that it violated federal oil-price controls from the early 1970s to January 1981.    The 1985 full-year results included after-tax charges of $1.15 billion for unusual items and $514 million for discontinued operations. Excluding the unusual items, 1985 earnings from continuing operations would have been $1.48 billion or $6.90 a share, Arco said.    Arco said its return on equity was 11.4% in 1986, compared with 19.2% in 1985, excluding unusual items and discontinued operations.    Amoco Corp.   Amoco's fourth-quarter net income fell 58%. For the year, net income dropped 62% from a year earlier.    Chicago-based Amoco blamed its depressed results on lower oil prices, among other things. Crude oil prices during the quarter were only about one-half their year-earlier levels, although prices began to firm late in the year, Amoco said.    Amoco's earnings from its U.S. production and exploration business were below most Wall Street estimates. However, special items pushed the company's results to within range of some conservative earnings estimates. Eugene Nowak, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. senior oil analyst, said the U.S. production and exploration unit &quot;hasn't experienced the type of upturn we expected in the quarter. It was somewhat of a disappointment.&quot;    Amoco said its fourth-quarter results include a $66 million post-tax charge for increasing the reserves of its insurance unit, Imperial Casualty andamp; Indemnity Co. However, the insurance unit charge was more than offset by money Amoco received from natural gas pipelines to settle contract disputes, oil analysts said.    Amoco said it had $108 million in after-tax gains from out-of-court settlements of the natural gas contract disputes.    Amoco said fourth-quarter earnings for its U.S. exploration and production business dropped 57% to $64 million from $149 million a year earlier. That business would have generated a loss without the effect of the gains from the natural gas contract settlements. Fourth-quarter earnings for Amoco's foreign exploration and production business fell 34% to $97 million from $148 million a year earlier.    Amoco's chemicals business was its only major sector to report improved fourth-quarter results. Quarterly earnings for Amoco's chemicals business climbed 24% to $56 million from $45 million.    Unocal Corp.   Unocal, based in Los Angeles, took a $125 million after-tax charge in the 1985 fourth quarter to write down its shale oil project in Parachute Creek, Colo. Unocal also said its 1986 fourth quarter compared well as a result of lower taxes on foreign operations, reduced interest expense and greater gains on asset sales.    Fourth-quarter revenue fell 30% to $2.06 billion from $2.92 billion a year earlier. Full-year revenue fell 28% to $8.35 billion from $11.64 billion in 1985.    In the full year 1986, after-tax gains from asset sales were $85 million, compared with $147 million after taxes in 1985. The 1985 gains came primarily from the public sale and distribution to shareholders of units in Union Exploration Partners Ltd., a master limited partnership. The move was among Unocal's responses to an unsuccessful takeover bid led by T. Boone Pickens Jr.    Fred L. Hartley, chairman, said cost-cutting and reduced capital expenditures allowed Unocal to trim its long-term debt by $430 million during 1986 to $5.1 billion at year's end. &quot;Further substantial debt repayment is planned for 1987,&quot; he said. Much of the debt was incurred to buy back about one-third of the company's stock in an effort to thwart Mr. Pickens' bid.    Mr. Hartley also called on Congress and the Reagan administration to impose an oil import fee that would set a floor price of about $25 a barrel. Mr. Hartley cited recent federal statistics showing a drop of about 10% in U.S. oil production in December from the year-earlier level.    Amerada Hess Corp.   Amerada Hess's fourth-quarter profit of $58.3 million compares with a year-earlier loss of $365.8 million, including a $432.7 million one-time charge. Exclusive of that year-earlier charge, fourth-quarter profit was down 13%.    Fourth-quarter revenue fell 53% to $923.5 million from $1.98 billion.    Bernard J. Picchi, an oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., said Hess benefited in the quarter from the recent improvement in residual fuel oil prices. The company said operating profit from refining and marketing business totaled $37 million, compared with just $3.2 million a year earlier.    Fourth-quarter profit from exploration and production, however, totaled $17 million, compared with $63.6 million a year ago, reflecting the long-term weakness in crude oil prices.    For the full year, the company's net loss of $219.4 million, compared with a loss of $260.4 million in 1985. The year-earlier figure includes the same $432.7 million charge, primarily from a write-down in the book value of tankers.    Full-year revenue totaled $4.06 billion, down 47% from $7.72 billion in 1985.                        1986              1985                    in      per       in      per      %                 millions  share   millions  share    chg.
