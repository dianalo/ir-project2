To test SO{sub 2}/NO{sub x} removal with flyash and products recycle, bench-scale experiments with a packed bed reactorwere performed at bag filter conditions. The most reactive solid fo NO{subx} removal was prepared by slurring Ca(OH){sub 2} with fly ash, CaSO{sub3}, and NaOH. The best conditions for NO{sub x} removal were high temperatures(tested up to 125{degree}C) and high concentrations of SO{sub 2} (testedup to 1500 ppM) and O{sub 2}(tested up to 20%). At the best conditions,NO{sub x} removed in 1 hour was 3 to 4 moles per 100 moles Ca(OH){sub2}, compared to 5 to 10 moles SO{sub 2} removed per 100 moles Ca(OH){sub2}. For the greatest SO{sub 2} removal, it was necessary to prepare solidsby slurring Ca(OH){sub 2} with fly ash and NaOH. The best SO{sub 2} removalwas obtained at higher relative humidities/lower temperatures. At theseconditions, SO{sub 2} removal in 1 hour was 60 to 80 moles SO{sub 2}per 100 moles Ca (OH){sub 2}, compared to 0.5 to 1 moles NO{sub x} removedper 100 moles Ca(OH){sub 2}. NaOH played an important role in SO{sub2} and NO{sub x} removal - as an improvement to fly ash dissolution,as a deliquescent, and as possible catalyst for NO{sub x} removal. Whenslurried with fly ash and NaOH, CaSO{sub 3} substantially improved thesolids reactivity toward NO{sub x}, but did not affect SO{sub 2} removal.No optimum temperature for simultaneous SO{sub 2}/NO{sub x} removal wasfound. NO{sub x} removal increased with temperature while SO{sub 2} removaldecreased. 32 refs., 24 figs., 16 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
