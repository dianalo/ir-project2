An added uncertaintyis the legislation that has been introduced in Congress. The stakes arehigh for railroads and their best customers - coal shippers. Caught inthe middle are coal producers. Whatever the eventual outcome, Congressand the Commission will continue to hear that the solution was incorrectand must be reexamined. The basic problem the ICC is facing is that almostevery economic study shows that efficiently run railroads would be revenueadequate with rates far below the 180% jurisdictional threshold. TheICC, conversely, seems to feel it must give more than 180% to the railroadson captive traffic. There simply is no way to rationalize anything ashigh as the current jurisdictional threshold, let alone higher. Thus,if the ICC continues on its current course, Congress will act sooneror later to restrain rail pricing of captive commodities. However, effectiverelief will not be attained unless and until coal producers and consumersdemand that their Washington representatives, such as EEI, NCA and CURE,withdraw their endorsement of the 180% jurisdictional threshold giveawayand insist upon marginal cost pricing for captive coal traffic.</TEXT></DOC>
