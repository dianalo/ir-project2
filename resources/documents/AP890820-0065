The workers covered by the pact with Pacific Telesis are among200,000 members of the Communications Workers of America on strikeat so-called ``Baby Bell'' regional phone companies in the West,East and Midwest.   ``Our people basically are very happy; we haven't heard such loudshouting of joy since they've gone out,'' CWA Local 9415 PresidentJessie Wilson said by by telephone from union headquarters asworkers cheered in the background.   Meanwhile, the strike at Bell Atlantic, which covers sixmid-Atlantic states and Washington, D.C., moved a step closer toagreement Sunday when the company's Pennsylvania subsidiary settledwith one of two striking unions. Strikes continued at NYNEX, servingNew York and the Northeast; and Ameritech, which covers fiveMidwestern states. No talks were scheduled Sunday in those twostrikes.   All four regional companies have continued service by replacingstriking operators, technical and clerical workers with managementpersonnel, but there have been delays for installation and operatorservices.   The tentative three-year pact at Pacific Telesis was approved bynegotiators at 1:15 a.m. Sunday, 16 days into the strike thataffected 13.2 million customers at PacTel subsidiaries Pacific Belland Nevada Bell Telephone Co.   Most of the strikers were expected to be back on the job within24 hours, said CWA spokeswoman Vira Milirides. Pacific Bellspokeswoman Lynn Jimenez said strikers would begin returning to workSunday night.   Jimenez said thousands of workers contacted shift supervisorswith the intention of returning to work Sunday night. She had nofigures on employees who had already returned to their jobs. Jimenezexpected a ``nearly full complement'' on Monday shifts.   The union walked out over a company proposal that employees beara share of health-care insurance premiums.   The contract would allow PacTel to establish a network of doctorsand hospitals which would meet employee health needs at little or nocost to workers, according to a statement by Pacific Bell. The pactallows workers to see doctors outside the network, but they wouldhave to pay more.   Wage and bonus hikes and other financial provisions of thecontract will raise salaries an average of 11 percent over the lifeof the contract, Wilson said.   Under the contract, workers would receive a 3.1 percent pay hikethe first year, followed by raises of 3.7 percent and 2.6 percent inthe next two years, according to a statement by Pacific Bell.   Employee pay now ranges from $228 a week for some operators to$650 for some skilled technicians, according to union figures.   Although the contract must still be approved by membership, aratification vote isn't expected for several weeks.   Jimenez said the company, which employs 41,800 of the strikers,asked some 17,000 managers to remain at temporary job assignmentsthis week.   ``We have company economists being directory assistance operatorsand we're asking them to stay for the time being so we can maintainthe same level of good service that we've been able to offer throughthe strike,'' Jimenez said.   Pacific Bell serves California and parts of Nevada. Nevada BellTelephone Co., also a subsidiary of San Francisco-based PacificTelesis, has 745 workers, one-third of whom crossed picket lines.   The strike at Pacific Telesis began at 11:59 p.m. on Aug. 5, whenthe last contract expired.   During the walkout, there were 450 serious acts of sabotage orvandalism, said PacTel spokesman Terry Mulready. Rewards of $10,000to $25,000 for information leading to an arrest and convictionremain in effect, Mulready said.   In Philadelphia, representatives of the International Brotherhoodof Electrical Workers reached a tentative agreement Sunday with Bellof Pennsylvania.   The subsidiary announced the settlement was similar to a dealreached Thursday between the CWA and Bell Atlantic.   But IBEW workers will stay off the job until Bell of Pennsylvaniasettles local issues with the CWA and an agreement is reachedbetween the IBEW and sister company New Jersey Bell, officials said.   ``It's a step forward, but we're not really going anywhere,''said Chuck Schalch, a Bell of Pennsylvania spokesman. ``We're hopingthe CWA isn't far behind.''   Bell of Pennsylvania's tentative deal with the 1,900 IBEW memberscalls for a 7.5 percent pay increase over the life of the proposedthree-year contract, a profit-sharing plan that could yield as muchas $600 a year per worker and a new health-care arrangement intendedto hold down costs, Bell of Pennsylvania said.   In another development, New York Telephone Co., a NYNEXsubsidiary, reported discovering 13 cases of burned or cut phonelines in New York state and Connecticut on Saturday and Sunday.Company spokesman Peter Muller said it was unusual for so many linesto be vandalized, but would not link the destruction to the2-week-old walkout.</TEXT></DOC>
