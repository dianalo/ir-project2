Virtually all of Beijing University's 15,000 students appearedto be taking part. Students at at least four other universitiesalso participated.   At Beijing Normal University, students waving their departmentflags marched around campus chanting ``boycott class.''   Leaders said they believed there was total participation in theboycott. At Beijing University, a few dozen students were sittingin one classroom but said they were not there to attend class.``Our slogan is `boycott classes but don't boycott studies,'''several students said.   A student wearing a red armband identifying him as one of thestrike organizers said: ``All the students are taking part in thestrike.''   He said, however, that if any student wants to go to class thestrikers will only use ``democratic methods'' _ not force _ topersuade them to boycott.   ``If our goal is democracy, we must solve our problemsdemocratically,'' he said.   A poster in one classroom building said: ``Teachers, pleaseunderstand and support our strike. I love my teachers but I lovethe truth more.''   Posters supporting the strike and proclaiming the studentdemands for democratic reforms covered many buildings in the centerof campus. Sheets of notepad paper bearing the character ``strike''were plastered over classroom windows.   One poster, an appeal to the National People's Congress, orparliament, and the Chinese People's Political ConsultativeConference, an advisory body, for tolerance of the student actions,was signed by 143 teachers.   Students at Beijing Normal University said they were trying tocontact schools nationwide to persuade them to join.   Outside the campus, students carried mimeographed sheets of thefirst edition of their independent newspaper, posting them onlampposts.   The newspaper contained accounts of alleged police beatings ofstudents during demonstrations last week.   On Sunday, the students took their appeal for democracy to thestreets, making speeches to passers-by and plastering walls andsidewalks with posters.   School authorities made no attempt to interfere Sunday. Nopolice or soldiers were seen.   The protests in Beijing have been well organized and generallypeaceful, in contrast to marches Saturday in Xian and Changsa,where rampaging mobs looted stores, burned cars and seized agovernment building. Scores were reported hurt.   The unrest was perhaps the most violent since demonstrationsbegan April 15, when the death of reformer Hu Yaobang stirredanti-government sentiments and an organized protest campaign byuniversity students.   Many students also called for Premier Li Peng's resignation andhung posters on campus mocking him.   The official Xinhua News Agency said Monday's People's Dailynewspaper contained a commentary that warned: ``Social turmoil canonly do good to an extremely small number of people with ulteriormotives.''   About 150,000 people joined Saturday in one of the biggestprotests in Communist China's 40-year history, holding a 15-hourrally at Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Authorities allowed theprotest, but students alleged Sunday that police beat several andinjured one seriously.   Worse violence was reported Saturday in Xian and Changsha. Thestate-run Xinhua News Agency said rioters in Xian, a populartourist city and capital of northwestern Shaanxi province, forcedtheir way into the provincial government compound and burnedbuildings and vehicles.   It said 130 security officers were injured and 18 people werearrested. Xinhua said the melee began after students who had beenmourning Hu left the scene.   A student contacted by telephone said at least 30 people werearrested.   Another student, speaking on condition of anonymity, saw about50 youths began ``ripping limbs off trees and throwing anythingthey could,'' including rocks, at a truck of security forces. Hesaid hundreds of armed security forces in riot gear closed off thearea by nightfall.   In Changsha, capital of Hu's home province of Hunan, rioterslooted 28 shops, Xinhua said. It said an unspecified number ofpolice were injured, one seriously, and about 100 people werearrested.   No deaths were reported in either riot.   Foreign sources in Changsha said about 1,000 students from HunanUniversity had marched to provincial government headquarters inmemory of Hu. They commandeered a truck and bus on the way.   But thousands of young street toughs joined the marchers andbegan breaking store windows, the sources said. They fled when ninetrucks of security forces appeared.   Peaceful student marches have been held in Shanghai, Tianjin,Chengdu, Nanjing and Canton, Western witnesses and Chinese sourcessay.</TEXT></DOC>
