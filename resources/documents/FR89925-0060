The assessment provides a basis for the conclusion that thefield testing of these genetically engineered cucumber plants will notpresent a risk of introduction or dissemination of a plant pest and willnot have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Based upon this finding of no significant impact, the Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statementneed not be prepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding ofno significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 850, Federal Building, 6505Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday throughFriday, except holidays.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>James White, Biotechnologist,Biotechnology Permit Unit, Biotechnology, Biologics, and EnvironmentalProtection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, Room 844, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,MD 20782, (301) 436-7612. For copies of the environmental assessment andfinding of no significant impact, write Ms. Linda Gordon at this same address.The environmental assessment should be requested under permit number 89-172-01.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 regulatethe introduction (importation, interstate movement, and release into theenvironment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that areplant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulatedarticles). A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52FR 22906).Cornell University, Geneva, New York, has submitted an application fora permit for release into the environment, to field test cucumbers geneticallyengineered to provide resistance to cucumber mosaic virus. The field trialwill take place in Ontario County, New York.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the cucumber plants under the conditionsdescribed in the Cornell University application. APHIS concluded that thefield testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction or disseminationand will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human enironment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Cornell University, as well as a reviewof other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation ofAPHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene encoding the viral coat protein of cucumber mosaic virus hasbeen inserted into the cucumber chromosome. In nature, chromosomal geneticmaterial can only be transferred to other sexually compatible plants bycross-pollinaton. In this field trial, the introduced gene cannot spreadto other plants by cross-pollination because the flowers of the cucumberplants will be removed from the plants prior to sexual maturity.2. Neither the viral coat protein gene itself, nor its gene product, conferson cucumber any plant pest characteristic.3. The expression of the viral coat protein gene does not provide the transformedcucumber plants with any apparent selective advantage over nontransformedcucumber in their ability to be disseminated or to become established inthe environment.4. Select noncoding regulatory regions derived from plant pests have beeninserted into the cucumber chromosome. These sequences do not confer oncucumber any plant pest characteristics. 5. The vector used to transfer the plant viral genes to the cucumber plantshas been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and does notpose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom a DNA sequence with known plant pest potential, has been disarmed;that is, genes that are necessary for producing plant disease have beenremoved from the vector. The vector has been tested and shown to be nonpathogenicto any susceptible plant.6. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering the gene to the plant genome (i.e., chromosomal DNA).The vector does not survive in the plants.7. The field test site is small (less than 0.3 acre) and is completelysurrounded by forest or fruit crops.This environmental assessment and finding of no signficant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 19th day of September 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
