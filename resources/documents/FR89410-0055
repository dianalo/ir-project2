The applicationis entitled `'Interactions of Structurally Modified Surfactants with ReservoirMinerals: Calorimetric, Spectroscopic and Electrokinetic Studies.''<T3>Scope: </T3>The research activity addressed in this effort proposesto increase our understanding of the role of the surfactant flooding processesas they relate to the loss of surfactants on reservoir minerals and therelation of the structure of the surfactant to the amount of the adsorption.Studies on surfactant adsorption have shown the process to be highly complexand depend on a number of factors such as pH, ionic strength, temperature,surfactant structure and purity and rock mineralogy. The adsorption characteristicsof ethoxylated sulfonates have been investigated to some extent. However,there has been no systematic work on the adsorption behavior of the xylenesulfonates. The subject proposal attacks this issue directly, and is thereforeconsidered unique.The multi-level approach to study these interactions in detail will benecessary to make surfactant flooding a viable process. The loss of surfactantflooding by absorption onto reservoir minerals is a major cause of pooreconomics of surfactant flooding.The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recognizes the need and opportunityto develop and apply new concepts to improve oil recovery from known oilfields. The DOE is particularly interested in developing new Enhanced OilRecovery processes which focus on light oil recovery from those fieldswhich are on the verge of being abandoned. Extreme dependence on non-U.S.sources for oil is inevitable unless significant action is taken to stablilizereserves. Chemical Flooding, Enhanced Oil Recovery processes are not nowviable mainly due to high adsorption loss of the surfactants.The term of the grant will be for a 12 month period at an estimated valueof $100,000.00.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:</T2> U.S. Department of Energy, PittsburghEnergy Technology Center, Acquisition and Assistance Division, P.O.
