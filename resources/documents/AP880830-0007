(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The man who would be president came tothe shores of Pontoosuc Lake with a mission, and a rather largefollowing.   The housing development here was one stop Monday for MichaelDukakis on a nostalgic trip with all the trappings of agubernatorial re-election campaign: talk of the rebound fromdouble-digit unemployment, plans to convert an abandoned mill intoa major art museum, and praise of partnership after partnershipthat has spurred western Massachusetts' sudden resurgence.   It was the sixth such annual visit for Dukakis, but this timethings are a bit different: he's running for president, notgovernor.   While George Bush and running mate Dan Quayle denounce Dukakisas soft on crime and weak on defense while questioning hispatriotism, Dukakis has spent two days in each of the past threeweeks touring his home state talking about home ownership, healthcare, economic development and drunken driving. Those are allimportant issues, to be sure, but such talk has for the most partbeen lost in the aggressive tone of the early campaign.   On Monday, for example, Bush toured a Missouri defense plant andcharacterized Dukakis as opposed to every modern weapon system``since the slingshot.''   Dukakis was here at a lakefront housing development, touting hisHomeownership Opportunity Program, which made it possible formoderate-income families to buy their first homes in an area thatotherwise would have been out of their price range.   This at a time when Dukakis is being criticized for allowing hispresidential campaign to lose its edge, and Bush to surge ahead inthe polls.   ``I am the sitting governor of this state and I've got to do myjob,'' was Dukakis' straight answer to a simple question: What washe doing here?   There were complaints from Dukakis aides that his message wasbeing obscured by coverage of the attacks on Dukakis by Bush andthe controversy over the Quayle selection.   ``It's been a little difficult to get through,'' Dukakis said ina huge understatment.   But the problems aren't all the doings of Bush and the media'sQuayle hunt.   Dukakis has offered few new national ideas during his regionaltrips at home and has focused most of his dicussion on stateprograms.   Many of these initiatives, in fact, are models for the nation,used as examples in shaping congressional proposals ranging fromthe National Economic Development Act to major welfare reform.   And had these trips come at another time, Dukakis might get outof them what his campaign wants: media coverage of some of his mostsuccessful programs, several of which he touts almost daily whencampaigning for the presidency.   But with Bush and Quayle criss-crossing the country pushingtheir agenda and slamming Dukakis, his attempt to talk aboutpublic-private partnership, health care and jobs _ to bring thecampaign, in Dukakis' words, ``up where it belongs'' _ has beenfrustrating.   Bush, for sure, hasn't faced any questions, or protests, latelyover the Route 7 interchange proposal here in Pittsfield. Butopponents of the plan to widen the rural highway from two lanes tofour at the cost of more than 20 homes turned out Monday.   Dukakis appears undaunted by the recent criticism, much of whichhas come from the large media contigent he has brought with him toPittsfield this week, Lawrence last week and Worcester the weekbefore.   ``I am a sitting governor and I do have a responsibility to thecitizens of this state,'' he told curious reporters Monday.   But his post-Labor Day schedule will have him in Massachusettsless frequently and his only remaining regional visit _ tosoutheastern Massachusetts _ is scheduled for just one day.   None of the criticism of the backyard stumping has been lost onDukakis, who was perhaps mindful of it when he delivered thispromise Monday: ``The dog days of August are almost over.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   John King of the The Associated Press coveredMichael Dukakis as governor in Boston and is now reporting on thenational presidential campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
