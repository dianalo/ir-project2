Background</ITAG>Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA or Act) grants theCommission exclusive jurisdiction over ``accounts, agreements (includingany transaction which is of the character of * * * an `option' * * *),and transactions involving contracts of sale of a commodity for futuredelivery traded or executed on a contract market * * * or any other boardof trade, exchange, or market * * * *'' 7 U.S.C. 2. The CEA and Commissionregulations require that transactions in commodity futures contracts andcommodity option contracts, with narrowly defined exceptions, occur onor subject to the rules of contract markets designated by the CFTC.\1\<NOTE/> In several recent releases \2\<NOTE/> and in response to requests for case-by-case review of variousproposed offerings,\3\<NOTE/> the Commission has addressed the applicability of the Actand Commission regulations to various forms of commodity-related instrumentsoffered and sold other than on designated contract markets. An overviewof off-exchange transactions and issues was commenced by issuance in December1987 of an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Advance Notice). TheAdvance Notice requested comment concerning, among other things, a proposedno-action position concerning certain commercial transactions, which, asdescribed, would have extended to certain categories of swap transactions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 7 U.S.C. 6(a), 6c(b), 6c(c). Section 4(a) of the CEA provides,<T3>inter alia, </T3>that it is unlawful to enter into a commodity futurescontract that is not made ``on or subject to the rules of a board of tradewhich has been designated by the Commission as a `contract market' forsuch commodity.'' 7 U.S.C. 6(a). This prohibition does not apply to futurescontracts made on or subject to the rules of a foreign board of trade,exchange or market. 7 U.S.C. 6(a). The exchange trading requirement reflectsCongress's view that such an environment would control speculation andpromote hedging. H.R. Rep. No. 44, 67th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1921). <T3>See also</T3> 7 U.S.C. 5 (Congressional findings concerning necessityfor regulation of futures and commodity option transactions). Pursuantto Sections 4c(b) and 4c(d), 7 U.S.C. 6c(b) and 6c(d), of the CEA, theCommission has authority to permit transactions in commodity options whichdo not take place on contract markets. Currently, only two narrow categoriesof such option transactions exist: trade options (in which the offereeis a ``commercial user'' of the underlying commodity) and dealer options(in which the grantor fulfills the criteria of Section 4c(d)(1) of theCEA).

This statement reflects the Commission's view that atthis time most swap transactions, although possessing elements of futuresor options contracts, are not appropriately regulated as such under theAct and regulations. This policy statement is intended to recognize a non-exclusivesafe harbor for transactions satisfying the requirements set forth herein.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Safe Harbor Standards</ITAG>In determining whether a transaction constitutes a futures contract, theCommission and the courts have assessed the transaction ``as a whole witha critical eye toward its underlying purpose.'' \4\<NOTE/> Such an assessment entails a review of the ``overall effect''of the transaction as well as a determination as to ``what the partiesintended.'' \5\<NOTE/> Although there is no definitive list of the elements of futurescontracts, the CFTC and the courts recognize certain elements as commonto such contracts.\6\<NOTE/> Futures contracts are contracts for the purchase or saleof a commodity for delivery in the future at a price that is establishedwhen the contract is initiated, with both parties to the transaction obligatedto fulfill the contract at the specified price. In addition, futures contractsare undertaken principally to assume or shift price risk without transferringthe underlying commodity. As a result, futures contracts providing fordelivery may be satisfied either by delivery or offset.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>CFTC </T3>v. <T3>Co.

Other commenters have stressed that despite these distinctionsin the manner of trading of swaps and exchange products, the economic realityof swaps nevertheless resembles that of futures contracts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See generally, </T3>Bank for International Settlements, <T3>Recent Innovations in International Banking </T3>at 37-60 (April 1986);S. K. Henderson, ``Swap Crdit Risk: A Multi-Perspective Analysis,'' 44<T3>Business Lawyer </T3>365 (1989). Interest rate swaps have been describedas having three primary forms: coupon swaps (fixed rate to floating rateswaps); basis swaps (swap of one floating rate for another floating rate);and cross-currency interest rate swaps (swaps of fixed rate payments inone currency to floating rate payments in another currency). Currency swaptransactions involve agreements between two parties providing for exchangesof amounts in different currencies which are calculated on the basis ofa pre-established interest rate, a specified exchange rate, and a specifiednotional amount. Commodity swaps generally include swap transactions similarin structure to interest rate swaps, except that payments are calculatedby reference to the price of a specified commodity, such as oil.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ The average notional amount for swaps has been estimatedat $24 million. Letter from the New York Clearing House to CFTC, datedApril 6, 1989, commenting on Proposed Rule and Statutory InterpretationConcerning Certain Hybrid and Related Instruments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ <T3>E.g., </T3>Letter to CFTC from the International Swap Dealers Association,Inc., dated April 8, 1988, concerning Advance Notice; Letter to CFTC fromMorgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, dated April 11, 1988, concerningAdvance Notice.The Commission recognizes that swaps generally have characteristics, suchas individually-tailored terms, predominantly commercial and institutionalparticipants, and expectation of being held to maturity, rather than offsetduring the term of the agreement, that may warrant distinguishing themfrom futures contracts. The criteria set forth below identify certain swapsfor which regulation under the CEA and Commission regulations is unnecessary.These safe harbor standards are consistent with policies reflected in theCEA's jurisdictional exclusion for forward contracts,\12\<NOTE/> the Treasury Amendment,\13\<NOTE/> and the trade option exemption,\14\<NOTE/> and are otherwise consistent with Section 2(a)(1)(A) of theCEA. Although these jurisdictional and exemptive or exclusionary provisionsare not sufficiently broad to provide clear exemptive boundaries for manyswaps, they reflect policies relevant to the safe harbor policy set forthherein and may encompass certain swap transactions.\15\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Section 2(a)(1)(A) of the CEA provides that the term``future delivery'' does not include sales of any cash commodity for deferredshipment or delivery. 7 U.S.C. 2. Sales of cash commodities for deferreddelivery, or forward contracts, generally have been recognized to be commercial,merchandising transactions in physicial commodities entered into by commercialcounterparties who have the capacity to make or take delivery of the underlyingcommodity but in which delivery ``may be deferred for purposes of convenienceor necessity.'' 52 FR 47027; <T3>In re Stovall, </T3>[1977-1980 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.(CCH) andpara; 20,941 at 23,777-78 (CFTC 1979). The forward contract exclusionmay apply to certain types of swap transactions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ The Treasury Amendment provides that ``[n]othing in thisAct shall be deemed to govern or in any way be applicable to transactionsin foreign currency, security warrants, security rights, resales of installmentloan contracts, repurchase options, government securities, or mortgagesand mortgage purchase commitments, unless such transactions involve thesale thereof for future delivery conducted on a board of trade.'' 7 U.S.C.2. <T3>See generally, </T3>50 FR 42963 (October 23, 1985) (CFTC StatutoryInterpretation). <T3>See also, Commodity Futures Trading Commission </T3>v. <T3>American Board of Trade, </T3>473 F. Supp. 117 (S.D.N.Y. 1979), <T3>aff'd, </T3>803 F.2d 1242 (2d Cir. 1986). The Treasury Amendment mayapply to some types of transactions also characterized as swaps. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The trade option exemption, which is set forth in Rule32.4(a), 17 CFR 32.4(a) (1988), authorizes commodity option transactions,other than those on commodities specified in Rule 32.2(a), that are notexecuted on a designated contract market and that are: <ITAG tagnum="28">offered by a person which has a reasonable basis to believe that theoption is offered to a producer, processor, or commercial user of, or amerchant handling, the commodity which is the subject of the commodityoption transaction, or the products or byproducts thereof, and that suchproducer, processor, commercial user or merchant is offered or enters intothe commodity option transaction solely for purposes related to its businessas such. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">It should be noted that under Rule 32.4(a), only the offeree of thetrade option need qualify as a ``commercial user'' or ``merchant.'' Rule32.4(a) is silent concerning which party to a trade option may be the optionbuyer of a put or call or ``long,'' and which party may be the option sellerof a put or call or ``short.'' As a result, provided that the qualifyingcommercial offeree is entering the trade option transaction solely fornon-speculative purposes demonstrably related to its commercial businessin the commodity which is the subject of the option transaction, the requirementsof Rule 32.4(a) are met. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ The forward contract exclusion facilitates commoditytransactions within the commercial merchandising chain. The trade optionexemption similarly may be viewed as facilitating principal-to-principaltransactions in which the offeree is a commercial party with respect tothe underlying commodity. The Treasury Amendment reflects Congressionalintent to avoid duplicative regulation of foreign currency transactionsand other transactions in the interbank market supervised by bank regulatoryagencies. Consequently, the Commission has determined that a greater degree of claritymay be achieved through safe harbor guidelines establishing specific criteriafor swap transactions to which the Commission's regulatory framework willnot be applied. Swaps satisfying the requirements set forth below willnot be subject to regulation as futures or commodity option transactionsunder the Act and regulations. This policy statement addresses only swapssettled in cash, with foreign currencies considered to be cash.\16\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ As noted previously, certain categories of swap transactionsmay be subject to the forward contract exclusion, the Treasury Amendmentand the trade option exemption. The safe harbor criteria set forth hereinapply equally to options on swaps. 1. Individually-Tailored Terms Individual tailoring of the terms of swap agreements is frequently citedas indispensable to the operation of the swap market. Commenters have indicatedthat swap agreements are based upon individualized credit determinationsand are tailored to reflect the particular business objectives of the counterparties.Tailoring occurs through private negotiations between the parties and mayinvolve not only financial terms but issues such as representations, covenants,events of default, term to maturity and any requirement for the postingof collateral or other credit enhancement. Such tailoring and counterpartycredit assessment distinguish swap transactions from exchange transactions,where the contract terms are standardized and the counterparty is unknown.In addition, the tailoring of swap terms means that, unlike exchange contracts,which are fungible, swap agreements are not fully standardized.To qualify for safe harbor treatment, swaps must be negotiated by the partiesas to their material terms, based upon individualized credit determinations,and documented by the parties in an agreement or series of agreements thatis not fully standardized.\17\<NOTE/> This requirement is intended to exclude from safe harbortreatment instruments which are fungible and therefore may be readily transferredand traded. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Formation of swaps pursuant to a master agreement betweentwo counterparties that establishes some or all contract terms for oneor more individual swap transactions between those counterparties is notprecluded by this requirement, provided that material terms of the masteragreement and transaction specifications are individually tailored by theparties. 2. Absence of Exchange-Style Offset Exchange-traded futures contracts generally may be terminated by offset,\18\<NOTE/> that is, liquidated through establishment of an equal andopposite position. For exchange-traded futures contracts, the universalcounterparty to each cleared position is the clearing organization. Priorconsent of the clearing organization, as counterparty, is unnecessary tooffset.\19\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ In the context of exchange-traded futures, offset refersto the liquidation of a futures position through the acquisition of anopposite position. The availability of such offset, resulting in the liquidationof the position, typically is established by exchange rules governing exchangemembers' relationships with the clearing house. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Chicago Mercantile Exchange Rule 806 (``a clearingmember long or short any commodity to the Clearing House as a result ofsubstitution may liquidate the position by acquiring an opposite positionfor its principal''); Board of Trade Clearing Corporation Regulation 705.00(``Where a member buys and sells the same commodity for the same delivery,and such contracts are cleared through the Clearing House, the purchasesand sales shall be offset to the extent of their equality, and the membershall be deemed a buyer from the Clearing House to the extent that hispurchases exceed his sales, or a seller to the Clearing House to the extentthat his sales exceed his purchases''); New York Futures Exchange Rule3-4 (``As between the Clearing Corporation and the original parties tofutures contracts and option contracts, such contracts shall be bindingupon the original parties until liquidated by offset, delivery, exerciseor expiration, as the case may be''). Of course, the ability to offsetin any given case depends upon the availability of a counterparty to enterinto an offsetting transaction at an acceptable price. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ However, the ability to liquidate contractual positionsthrough offset is established by clearing organization rules to which allclearing members consent. In contrast, swap transactions have been described as transactions whichcreate performance obligations terminable only with counterparty consentand which generally are expected to be maintained to maturity. A swap counterpartywho seeks to eliminate the economic effect of a swap agreement may enterinto a reverse swap agreement, that is, a second swap with the same maturityand payment requirements, with the same or a new counterparty, but in whichthe party seeking to eliminate its economic exposure assumes the reverseposition (in this case the obligations of each party to both transactionscontinue to maturity). A swap counterparty who seeks to terminate, absentdefault, its obligations under a swap agreement may: (1) Undertake a swapsale, in which, based upon consent of the counterparty, it assigns itsrights and obligations under the swap to a third party; or (2) negotiatean early termination of the transaction, or swap ``closeout,'' in whichit negotiates a lump sum payment with its counterparty to terminate theswap.\20\<NOTE/> In the latter two cases, termination of the obligations createdby a swap is dependent upon consent of the counterparty. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Swap paties may agree in advance upon a termination formulaor price for the swap. To qualify for safe harbor treatment, the swap must create obligationsthat are terminable, absent default, only with the consent of the counterparty.If consent to termination is given at the outset of the agreement and atermination formula or price fixed, the consent provision must be privatelynegotiated. This requirement is intended to confine safe harbor treatmentto instruments that are not readily used as trading vehicles, that areentered into with the expectation of performance and that are terminatedas well as entered into based upon private negotiation. 3. Absence of Clearing Organization or Margin System As noted above, the necessity for individualized credit determinationshas been described as a hallmark of swap transactions. A number of commentershave stressed both the dependence of the current swap market on such determinationsand the absence of a multilateral ``credit support'' mechanism, such asa clearing organization, for swaps. In accordance with the concept of swapsas dependent upon private negotiation and individualized credit determinationsas to the capacity of certain parties to perform, this safe harbor is applicableonly to swap transactions that are not supported by the credit of a clearingorganization and that are not primarily or routinely supported by a market-to-marketmargin and variation settlement system designed to eliminate individualizedcredit risk.\21\<NOTE/> The ability to impose individualized credit enhancement requirementsto secure either changes in the credit risk of a counterparty or increasesin the credit exposure between two counterparties consistent with the abovecriteria would not be affected. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Several commenters urged the Commission to adopt a safeharbor for swaps that would be conditioned upon, among other things, theabsence of a credit support mechanism. <T3>See </T3>Letter to CFTC from Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, dated April 8,1988, concerning Advance Notice, at 41-42; Letter to CFTC from ManufacturersHanover, dated April 11, 1988, concerning Advance Notice, at 4. The safeharbor standard is based upon individualized credit determinations at theoutset and during the pendency of the contract. 4. The Transaction is Undertakenin Conjunction With a Line of Business The absence of public participation in the swaps market has frequentlybeen cited as a factor supporting different regulatory treatment of swapsand futures contracts. Swap market participants are predominantly institutionaland commercial entities such as corporations, commercial and investmentbanks, thrift institutions, insurance companies, governments and government-sponsoredor chartered entities.\22\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ Letter dated April 8, 1988, to CFTC from InternationalSwap Dealers Association, Inc. Concerning Advance Notice.The safe harbor set forth herein is limited to swap transactions undertakenin conjunction with the parties' line of business.\23\<NOTE/> This restriction is intended to preclude public participationin qualifying swap transactions and to limit qualifying transactions tothose based upon individualized credit determinations. This restrictiondoes not preclude dealer transactions in swaps undertaken in conjunctionwith a line of business, including financial intermediation services. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Swap transactions entered into with respect to exchangerate, interest rate, or other price exposure arising from a participant'sline of business or the financing of its business would be consistent withthis standard. 5. Prohibition Against Marketing to the Public Swap transactions eligible for safe harbor treatment may not be marketedto the public. This restriction reflects the institutional and commercialnature of the existing swap market and the Commission's intention to restrictqualifying swap transactions to those undertaken as an adjunct of the participant'sline of business. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Conclusion </ITAG>This policy statement is intended to clarify the regulatory treatment ofcertain transactions in order to facilitate legitimate market transactionsin a field distinguished by innovation and rapid growth. Consequently,the Commission proposes to continue to review on a case-by-case basis transactionsthat do not meet the above criteria and that are not otherwise excludedfrom Commission regulation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on July 17, 1989 by the Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jean A.
