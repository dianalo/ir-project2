The rule would permit registered investmentcompanies to hold securities of foreign banks and foreign insurance companieswithout regard to the limitations of section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act (15U.S.C. 80a-12(d)(1)(A)). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Summary </ITAG>Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act makes it unlawful for a registered investmentcompany to acquire securities issued by any other investment company inexcess of certain limitations. The broad definition of the term ``investmentcompany'' in sections 3(a)(1) and 3(a)(3) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a)(1)and 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a)(3)) may include not only those organizations typicallyregarded as investment companies, but also banks and insurance companies.Section 3(c)(3) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a3(c)(3)) specifically excludes``banks'' and ``insurance companies'' from being deemed investment companies,but the definitions of these terms do not include foreign banks and foreigninsurance companies. Proposed rule 12d1-1 would both define such foreignentities and except them from the definition of ``investment company''for purposes of determining compliance with section 12(d)(1)(A). Thus,the proposed rule would give registered investment companies more flexibilityto invest in the securities. of foreign banks and foreign insurance companies.Proposed rule 12d1-1 would contain only two conditions. The first conditionwould require any securities acquired under the rule to be direct interestsin the foreign bank or insurance company, rather than interests in sometype of entity organized under the auspices of the bank or insurance company.The other condition would subject acquisitions of foreign insurance companyvoting securities made in reliance on the exemption provided by the ruleto the same limitations that apply to acquisitions of voting securitiesof domestic insurance companies. The release will first address the background and purpose of section 12(d)(1)(A)and the status of foreign banks and insurance companies under that provisionand other provisions of the Act, and then discuss and request public commenton the provisions of the proposed new rule, including the costs and benefitsassociated with its adoption.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>A. Introduction Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act imposes limitations on the amount of securitiesof investment companies which may be held by other investment companiesregistered under the Act.\1\<NOTE/> Specifically, that section provides as follows:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The section also limits the amount of securities of registeredinvestment companies that may be acquired by an investment company, whetherregistered or not. <ITAG tagnum="21">It shall be unlawful for any registered investment company (the ``acquiringcompany'') and any company or companies controlled by such acquiring companyto purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by any other investmentcompany (the ``acquired company''), and for any investment company (the``acquiring company'') and any company or companies controlled by suchacquiring company to purchase or otherwise acquire any security issuedby any registered investment company (the ``acquired company''), if theacquiring company and any company or companies controlled by it immediatelyafter such purchase or acquisition own in the aggregate_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) More than 3 per centum of the total outstanding voting stock ofthe acquired company; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Securities issued by the acquired company having an aggregatevalue in excess of 5 per centum of the value of the total assets of theacquiring company; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) Securities issued by the acquired company and all other investmentcompanies (other than Treasury stock of the acquiring company) having anaggregate value in excess of 10 per centum of the value of the total assetsof the acquiring company.</ITAG>Section 12(d)(1)(A) does not restrict registered investment companies'holdings of securities of United States banks and insurance companies,primarily because section 3(c)(3) of the Act specifically excludes ``anybank or insurance company'' from the definition of ``investment company.''The definitions of the terms ``bank'' and ``insurance company,'' however,do not include foreign entities.\2\<NOTE/> Therefore, to the extent that foreign banks and insurancecompanies are involved in owning, holding, trading, investing or reinvestingin securities, they may be deemed to be investment companies within thedefinition of section 3(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a)) and as thatterm is used elsewhere in the Act.\3\<NOTE/> Registered investment companies would then be restrictedby section 12(d)(1)(A) in the amount of securities of these entities thatsuch investment companies may acquire. Conversely, because the term ``insurancecompany'' does not include a foreign insurance company, the limitationimposed by section 12(d)(2) would not apply to foreign insurance companies.\4\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Section 2(a)(5) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(5)) defines``bank'' as follows: <ITAG tagnum="28">``Bank'' means (A) a banking institution organized under the lawsof the United States, (B) a member bank of the Federal Reserve System,(C) any other banking institution or trust company, whether incorporatedor not, doing business under the laws of any State or of the United States,a substantial portion of the business of which consists of receiving depositsor exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banksunder the authority of the Comptroller of the Currency, and which is supervisedand examined by State or Federal authority having supervision over banks,and which is not operated for the purpose of evading the provisions ofthis title, and (D) a receiver, conservator, or other liquidating agentof any institution or firm included in clauses (A), (B), or (C) of thisparagraph. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Section 2(a)(17) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(17)) defines ``insurancecompany'' as follows: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">``Insurance company'' means a company which is organized as an insurancecompany, whose primary and predominant business activity is the writingof insurance or the reinsuring of risks underwritten by insurance companies,and which is subject to supervision by the insurance commissioner or asimilar official or agency of a State; or any receiver or similar officialor any liquidating agent for such a company, in his capacity as such. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ An ``investment company'' is defined in section 3(a)(1)of the Act as any issuer which is, holds itself out as being engaged primarily,or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting,or trading in securities. <ITAG tagnum="28">An ``investment company'' is defined in section 3(a)(3) of the Actas any issuer which is engaged or proposes to engage in the business ofinvesting, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, andowns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding40% of the value of the issuer's total assets (exclusive of Governmentsecurities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">``Investment securities'' are defined in section 3(a)(3) to includeall securities except (A) Government securities, (B) securities issuedby employees' securities companies, and (C) securities issued by majority-ownedsubsidiaries of the owner which are not investment companies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Section 12(d)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-12(d)(2)) imposescertain limitations on registered investment companies' holdings of UnitedStates insurance company securities: <ITAG tagnum="28">It shall be unlawful for any registered investment company and anycompany or companies controlled by such registered investment company topurchase or otherwise acquire any security (except a security receivedas a dividend or as a result of a plan of reorganization of any company,other than a plan devised for the purpose of evading the provisions ofthis paragraph) issued by any insurance company of which such registeredinvestment company and any company or companies controlled by such registeredcompany do not, at the time of such purchase or acquisition, own in theaggregate at least 25 per centum of the total outstanding voting stock,if such registered company and any company or companies controlled by itown in the aggregate, or as a result of such purchase or acquisition willown in the aggregate, more than 10 per centum of the total outstandingvoting stock of such insurance company. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Because the purpose of proposed rule 12dl-1 is to place foreign insurancecompanies on an equal footing with domestic insurance companies, proposedrule 12dl-l(a)(2) would apply the limitations of section 12(d)(2) to thepurchase of foreign insurance company shares.</ITAG>B. Legislative Historyof Section 12(d)(1)(A) Section 12(d)(1)(A) was enacted as a part of the Investment Company AmendmentsAct of 1970,\5\<NOTE/> replacing a less restrictive provision.\6\<NOTE/> The Report of the House Committee on Interstate and ForeignCommerce \7\<NOTE/> noted that the new provision was intended to address theCommission's concerns about fund holding companies, as set forth in theCommission's report <T3>Public Policy Implications of Investment Company Growth </T3>(``PPI''or the ``Report'').\8\<NOTE/> The first concern was that the exercise of or potential forinfluence or control of a registered investment  company by a fund holdingcompany, or a group of related fund holding companies, could be disadvantageousto the other investors in the controlled company. In addition, the threatof redemption by the holding company or companies could cause the managementof the acquired company to deviate from the investment program or policiesthat it would otherwise pursue. Management might also be required to maintainlarge cash balances in anticipation of large redemptions, or to sell offa large portion of its assets in the event of a redemption, to the disadvantageof the other investors in the fund.\9\<NOTE/> Further, as was noted in the Report, ``inherent in the fundholding company structure is a layering of costs including advisory fees,administrative expenses, sales loads, and brokerage fees, all of whichserve to make a fund on funds a particularly expensive investment vehicle.''\10\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Pub. L. 91-547, enacted December 14, 1970. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Section 12(d)(1) of the Act formerly prohibited a registeredinvestment company from purchasing more than five percent of the totaloutstanding voting stock of any other investment company which concentratesits investments in a particular industry or group of industries or morethan three percent of the total outstanding voting stock of any other typeof investment company. It did not place any limitation on the percentageof an investment company's assets which could be invested in other investmentcompanies, however. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ H.R. Rep.

The Report also dismissed the claim that the fund holding company structureprovides investors with diversification, noting that investment in a singlemutual fund offers diversification by spreading the investment over a numberof companies in different industries. ``Any added value of diversificationoffered by a fund on funds,'' according to the Report, ``is largely illusory.''Although theoretically there may be a greater spreading of risk, as a practicalmatter, ``diversification upon diversification does   not result in greatersafety in proportion to the number of layers imposed on the original investment.''\11\<NOTE/> In any event, any potential advantages of the fund holdingcompany structure were found not significant enough to warrant duplicationof fees and expenses.\12\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ PPI at 320. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ PPI at 321. See section 12(d)(1)(F) of the Act (15 U.S.C.80a-12(d)(1)(F)) for an exception to the limitations of section 12(d)(1)for securities purchased by a registered investment company with low salesloads and restrictions on its rights to redeem the securities purchased,among other provisions. C. Status of Foreign Banks Under the Act As was noted above, foreign banks may be deemed to be investment companiesunder the Act.\13\<NOTE/> The Commission has not previously addressed the status ofthese entities under section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act or the issue of whetherregistered investment companies may purchase securities issued by foreignbanks. However, the Commission has long recognized in other contexts thatmost foreign banks are very much unlike domestic investment companies,and need not be regulated in the same manner.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>See supra </T3>text accompanying notes 2 and 3. Beginning in 1979, the Commission granted exemptions to a number of foreignbanks under section 6(c) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-6(c)),\14\<NOTE/> permitting them to sell their debt securities,    directlyor through finance subsidiaries, within the United States without registeringas investment companies under the Act.\15\<NOTE/> More recently, the Division of Investment Management (the``Division''), by delegated authority, has granted foreign banks exemptionsunder section 6(c) to sell equity securities in the United States.\16\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Section 6(c) provides the Commission broad exemptivepowers, to be exercised through rulemaking upon its own motion, or by orderupon application, to exempt conditionally or unconditionally any person,security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities,or transactions, from any provisions of the Act or any rule or regulationunder the Act, if and to the extent that the exemption is necessary orappropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection ofinvestors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisionsof the Act.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, notices of application and orders for Banque Nationalede Paris, Credit Lyonnais, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Post-Och Kreditbanken,Skandinaviska Erskilda Banken, Societe Generale and Svenska Handelbanken,Investment Company Act Rel.

A foreign bank is defined by rule 6c-9 as a banking institution incorporatedor organized under the laws of a country other than the United States thatis regulated as such by that country's government or an agency thereof,is engaged substantially in commercial banking activity, and is not operatedfor the purpose of evading the provisions of the Act.\18\<NOTE/> ``Engaged substantially in commercial banking activity''means ``engaged regularly in, and deriving a substantial portion of itsbusiness from, extending commercial and other types of credit, and acceptingdemand and other types of deposits, that are customary for commercial banksin the country in which the head office of the banking institution is located.''\19\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Rule 6c-9(b)(2). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ Rule 6c-9(b)(3). D. Status of Foreign Insurance CompaniesUnder the Act Foreign insurance companies, like foreign banks, have been accorded specialtreatment by the Commission, notwithstanding their possible status underthe Act as investment companies. In this regard, the Commission has granteda number of exemptions from all provisions of the Act under section 6(c)in the case of applications contemplating both debt and equity offerings.\20\<NOTE/> As has been the case with foreign bank exemptions, theseexemptions have been requested by foreign insurance companies as issuers;they have not been concerned with registered investment company purchasesof foreign insurance company securities or with section 12(d)(1)(A) ofthe Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ <T3>See. e.g.,</T3> notices of application and orders for Nationale-NederlandenN.V.

E. Recent Developments On February 15, 1989, the Division, in response to a request from the InvestmentCompany Institute (``ICI''), issued a letter (the ``ICI letter'') statingthat it would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission undersection 12(d)(1)(A)(iii) in the event that a registered investment companyinvested more than ten percent of its assets in certain of the securitiesof entities that, because they were foreign banks, might be deemed to beinvestment companies. Section 12(d)(1)(A)(iii) prohibits an investmentcompany from having in the aggregate more than ten percent of its assetsinvested in other investment companies.\22\<NOTE/> The response went on to provide,  however, that the ten percentlimitation imposed by section 12(d)(1)(A)(iii) could be exceeded only ifthe excess was attributable to the value of debt securities and non-votingpreferred stock issued by foreign banks as defined in rule 6c-9(b)(2) underthe Act. The no-action response did not extend to investments in otherforeign bank equity securities or to investments in foreign insurance companysecurities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ The ICI had not requested no-action advice under section12(d)(1)(A)(i), which prohibits the acquisition of more than three percentof the voting stock of another investment company, or section 12(d)(1)(A)(ii),which prohibits the acquisition of securities of any one investment companywith an aggregate value exceeding five percent of the total assets of theacquiring company.Prior to the issuance of the ICI letter, the Division had considered thelimitations imposed by section 12(d)(1)(A)(iii) on purchases of securitiesof foreign banks and foreign insurance companies in its letter concerningIndosuez Asia Investment Services Ltd. (pub. avail. Mar. 21, 1988). Inthat letter, the Division indicated that a Hong Kong investment company(not registered with the Commission) could purchase securities of Asianbanks and insurance companies in excess of the ten percent limitation imposedby section 12(d)(1)(A)(iii), provided that those entities were engagedin bona fide banking and insurance businesses.\23\<NOTE/> In a footnote, the Division identified the critical elementsfor a determination that an entity was engaged in those businesses. Tobe engaged in a bona fide banking business, a foreign bank would have tomeet the standards of rule 6c-9. To be engaged in a bona fide insurancebusiness, a foreign insurance company would have to be regulated and licensedby the government of the country in which it was organized, or by an agencythereof, and be ``engaged primarily and predominantly in the writing ofbona fide insurance agreements of the types specified in Section 3(a)(8)of the Securities Act of 1933 (having substantially similar credit, insuranceunderwriting and investment risk characteristics as those sold in the UnitedStates) or the reinsurance of risks on such agreements underwritten bybona fide insurance companies.'' As discussed below, these standards providethe basis for the generic relief from section 12(d)(1) proposed in thisrelease. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ The issue arose because the Hong Kong investment companyalso held securities of some registered investment companies. <T3>See supra</T3> note 1, and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>The Commission's preliminary view is that, under appropriate conditions,the limitations imposed by section 12(d)(1)(A) need not apply to registeredinvestment company purchases of foreign bank and foreign insurance companysecurities. Therefore, the Commission is proposing rule 12d1-1 for publiccomment. Proposed rule 12d1-1 would, in effect, exempt acquisitions ofsecurities of foreign banks and foreign insurance companies from the limitationsimposed by section 12(d)(1)(A) by stating that such entities are not tobe regarded as investment companies for purposes of determining compliancewith the limitations imposed by that section. Because the Commission seesno reason to distinguish between subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of section12(d)(1)(A) \24\<NOTE/> in the case of purchases of foreign bank and foreign insurancecompany securities, proposed rule 12d1-1 would provide an exemption fromall three subparagraphs. Proposed rule 12d1-1 would apply to purchasesof both debt and equity securities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ The subparagraphs are set forth in part A of the <T3>Background </T3>portion of this release.Paragraph (a) is the operative portion of the proposed rule. Subparagraph(a)(1) would make clear that the proposal would cover only direct obligationsof or interests in foreign banks or insurance companies, rather than interestsin any collective trusts, separate accounts, or other units organized bythose entities that function effectively as investment companies. Subparagraph(a)(2) would subject acquisitions of foreign insurance company voting securitiesmade in reliance on the exemption provided by the rule to the same limitationsthat section 12(d)(2) of the Act imposes upon acquisitions by registeredinvestment companies of the voting securities of United States insurancecompanies. This condition is in keeping with the policy behind the ruleproposal, which is to treat foreign and United States banks and insurancecompanies in an equivalent manner for purposes of section 12(d)(1). Paragraphs (b) and (c) would define the terms ``foreign bank'' and ``foreigninsurance company'' for purposes of the rule. The definition of ``foreignbank'' for these purposes is the same as the definition included in rule6c-9 under the Act, as discussed above.\25\<NOTE/> While no such precedent exists for the definition of ``foreigninsurance company,'' the two alternative versions of that definition beingproposed for public comment have been drafted so that the securities thatwould be covered by the proposed rule include only those securities issuedby institutions that are engaged in a bona fide insurance business andthat do not function as investment companies. Thus, the proposed rule specifiesthat the insurance company must be engaged primarily and predominantly\26\<NOTE/> in writing bona fide insurance agreements of the type specifiedin section 3(a)(8) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(8)),\27\<NOTE/> except for the substitution of supervision by foreign governmentinsurance regulators for the state regulators referred to in that section.The version of paragraph (c) presented in Alternative I includes additionallanguage designed to clarify the types of agreements that may constitutethe primary business of the insurance company; the agreements are to havevarious characteristics similar to those sold in the United States. Thus,the exemption provided by Alternative I would not extend to contracts whoseessential features had not actually been subject to section 3(a)(8) scrutinyin the United States. Alternative II does not include this additional languageout of concern that the language might be confusing to investment companiesor might make the appropriate section 3(a)(8) analysis unduly difficult.The Commission is specifically requesting comment as to whether the additionallanguage included in Alternative I is necessary or helpful in characterizingthe types of foreign insurance companies whose securities would be coveredby the proposed rule. Paragraphs (b) and (c) also provide that the foreignentities must not be operated for the purpose of evading the provisionsof the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ <T3>See supra </T3>text accompanying notes 17 to 19. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ This language derives from the definition of insurancecompany found in section 2(a)(17) of the Act. <T3>See supra </T3>note 2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Variable annuity contracts, for example, are not bonafide insurance agreements of the type included in section 3(a)(8) of theSecurities Act. In S.E.C. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. of America,359 U.S. 65 (1959), the Supreme Court concluded that such contracts weresecurities subject to federal securities regulation, and that the issuerof such contracts was an investment company and should be regulated assuch. <T3>See also </T3>S.E.C. v. United Benefit Life Ins. Co., 387 U.S. 202(1967).The proposed rule is intended to meet the wishes of registered investmentcompanies for greater flexibility with respect to investments in foreignbanking and insurance institutions, without compromising the protectionsafforded by section 12(d)(1)(A) to purchasers of shares in registered investmentcompanies. As was noted above, section 12(d)(1)(A) was enacted to dealwith the problems posed by the control of investment companies by fundholding companies, as well as the layering of costs to investors inherentin the fund holding company structure. These problems should not arisein the case of an investment company investing in foreign bank or foreigninsurance company securities. Securities issued by foreign banks and foreigninsurance companies are generally not redeemable. In addition, to the Commission'sknowledge, foreign banks and insurance companies, unlike investment companies,do not charge advisory fees and sales loads to purchasers of their securities.\28\<NOTE/> Therefore, a shareholder in an investment company relyingon the proposed rule would not incur an additional layer of costs associatedwith his investment in the investment company. Further, because banks andinsurance companies are engaged in businesses that are not simply investmentbusinesses, the purchase of securities of a number of different foreignbanks and insurance companies may result in genuine diversification andspreading of risks.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ The Commission specifically requests comment on thismatter. Finally, because the proposed rule would cover acquisitions of foreignbank and foreign insurance company securities by registered investmentcompanies, and deals only with issues related to section 12(d)(1)(A) ofthe Act, it does not include any restrictions as to type of security orconditions of the offering. Such restrictions might be appropriate in arule or exemptive order relating to purchases of foreign bank and foreigninsurance company securities by other investors.\29\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ As was discussed above, the applications relating tosales in the United States of foreign bank and foreign insurance companysecurities did contain several conditions. <T3>See supra </T3>notes 14-21, and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="84">Cost/Benefit of Proposed Action </ITAG>Proposed rule 12d1-1 would not impose any cost burden on registered investmentcompanies desiring to utilize its provisions. As discussed above, the Commissiondoes not expect that the proposed rule would increase costs to personspurchasing shares of registered investment companies. To the contrary,the rule should benefit investment companies and their shareholders byproviding greater flexibility to them in their purchases of securitiesof foreign banks and foreign insurance companies. The Commission specifically invites comments on its assessment of the costsand benefits associated with the proposal, including estimates of any costsand benefits perceived by commenters. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603, the Commission has prepared an InitialRegulatory Flexibility Analysis regarding proposed rule 12d1-1. The Analysisstates that the proposed rule is designed to provide investment companiesmore flexibility in acquiring the securities of foreign banks and foreigninsurance companies. It states that the Commission does not believe thatthe conditions to the use of the rule would be burdensome to investmentcompanies, regardless of their size, and notes that investment companiesmay elect to use the rule or not, depending on their investment policies.The Analysis states that, in the absence of the rule, investment companieswould need to file applications with the Commission in order to pursuecertain investment policies which the proposed rule would permit, and thatthe costs of that process would fall most heavily on small entities.
