(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   GOP national officials will try to mediate adispute that could result in Georgia's Republican Party showing upat the presidential nominating convention in New Orleans withcompeting delegations.   At the state Republican convention over the weekend, two slateswere elected _ one after party regulars stormed out of the AlbanyCivic Center.   Roger Allen Moore, general counsel for the national RepublicanParty, said GOP officials would hear from both sides in the dispute.   The case first would go before the party's nine-member contestcommittee, which would report its findings to the credentialscommittee, Moore said. A ruling by the 106-member credentialscommittee could be appealed to the national convention in NewOrleans this summer, he added.   Party regulars elected Fred Cooper, state chairman for theGeorge Bush campaign, to head the state's 48-member delegation tothis summer's convention, but not until after they had angrily leftthe civic center Saturday.   About 900 dissidents remained at the civic center afterward andelected a slate headed by Brant Frost, state chairman for PatRobertson's failed presidential campaign.   All 48 delegates are required to vote for Bush at theconvention, since Bush won every county in the state duringGeorgia's March 8 presidential primary.   Robertson captured only 13 percent of the state vote, but hisbackers, many of whom are party newcomers, organized in an effortto influence the party platform and the selection of a vicepresidential nominee.   The turmoil this weekend stemmed from efforts by state GOPChairman John Stuckey and other party regulars to denyRobertson-dominated county delegations a chance to participate inthe state convention.   ``This will probably wind up in an awful mess,'' said nationalcommitteeman Carl Gillis. ``All he (Stuckey) had to do was letthese folks be seated.''</TEXT></DOC>
