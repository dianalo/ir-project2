The department's temporary new regulations limiting trawl timesdo not protect endangered sea turtles as the department claims, thefederation argued.   The federation said it has learned that Commerce SecretaryRobert Mosbacher has data from National Marine Fisheries Servicescientists that demonstrates the mortality rate from a 105-minutetow time is more than four times greater than what the secretaryhas admitted.   Mosbacher on Monday promulgated regulations requiring shrimpersto lift their nets every 105 minutes to let any captured turtlesescape.   ``A recent report from the team of scientists charged withmanaging recovery efforts for the severely endangered Kemp's Ridleysea turtle states unequivocally that the species is physiologicallyunable to withstand tow times in lieu of of required (excluder)use,'' the federation said in its petition to U.S. District JudgeThomas Hogan.   Hogan is overseeing the federation's legal attack on Mosbacher'sfailure to require excluder devices.   Commerce spokesman Reed Boatright said he did not want tocomment on the lawsuit now that Hogan has a new petition before him.   Hogan last week ordered Mosbacher to adopt regulations of somesort by Monday to protect sea turtles from drowning in shrimpers'nets.   A new federal law last year requires shrimpers to use excluderdevices _ big boxes attached to nets with hinged sides that turtlescan swim through _ unless the secretary of commerce has good reasonto require other protective measures.   The trawling regulation is to last only until Sept. 7 while thedepartment solicits comment on what permanent regulations to adopt``in light of conservation needs of sea turtle populations and theeconomics of the shrimp fishing industry.''   Mosbacher's decided July 24 to suspend requirements for excluderdevices after Texas and Louisiana shrimpers protested their use byblockading Gulf Coast shipping channels. The shrimpers argue thatthe devices reduce their catch by as much as a third.   About 40 people organized by Greenpeace protested the trawlingrules in front of the Commerce Department Tuesday morning, chanting``Mosbacher, Mosbacher, hear our plea, save the turtles in thesea,'' and carrying posters with slogans like ``Shrimpers arecrying but turtles are dying.''   Faced with Mosbacher's suspension, the state of Florida decidedto proceed on its own. Gov. Bob Martinez and his cabinet on Tuesdayunanimously approved new regulations requiring vessels more than 25feet long using Florida waters to use excluder devices, and shortervessels to limit trawls to 90 minutes. The governor and cabinetrejected requests for a delay to permit a court challenge.   Atlantic Coast shrimpers largely have agreed to use the devices,environmentalists say.</TEXT></DOC>
