It has been found that, the same as in the case of Rh/La{sub 2}O{sub3}, complexes of CO are formed on the surface of this system, these complexesbeing coordinated simultaneously by atoms of the metal and surface atomsof the support. This was demonstrated in experiments on selective blockageof the support surface by adsorbed CO{sub 2}.</TEXT></DOC>
