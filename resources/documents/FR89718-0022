Justen, 813-893-3722.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> The spiny lobster fishery is managedunder the Fishery Management Plan for Spiny Lobster in the Gulf of Mexicoand South Atlantic (FMP), as amended, prepared by the Gulf of Mexico andSouth Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils), and its implementingregulations at 50 CFR Part 640 under the Magnuson Fishery Conservationand Management Act (Magnuson Act). The regulations require that traps,buoys, and vessels engaged in the spiny lobster trap fishery in the EEZbe identified by a number and color code issued by the Regional Director,Southeast Region, NMFS, or through Florida's identification system (andSection;640.6(a)). In the preamble to the proposed rule to implement the FMP (47FR 10880, March 12, 1982), NOAA recognized that a color code and numberassigned to a vessel in the spiny lobster fishery by Florida was adequateto meet the FMP's requirements. NOAA announced that the Regional Directorwould issue necessary identifiers to a non-Florida-licensed vessel fishingin the EEZ, that is, a vessel not required to obtain a permit number andcolor code through Florida's identification system. That announced policywas in keeping with the FMP's stated desire to keep Federal costs to aminimum, avoid unnecessary duplication, and minimize burdens on fishermenin implementing the Federal identification measure. Further, that policy,in practice, did not deny any participant access to the fishery in theEEZ. Florida recently enacted a three-year moratorium on the issuance of newspiny lobster trap licenses, thus limiting the number of participants inthe spiny lobster fishery in State waters. As a consequence, NOAA's pastpolicy regarding issuance of Federally issued numbers and color codes couldtheoretically deny access to the spiny lobster trap fishery in the EEZto Florida-based vessels unable to obtain State identifiers. Under theMagnuson Act, implementation of a system that limits entry to a fisheryin the EEZ requires that the Secretary of Commerce and Councils take intoaccount specified factors in a deliberative rulemaking process (16 U.S.C.1853(b)(6)). Such a system is presently beyond the scope and intent ofthe FMP and may not be created by rule or administrative practice in thespiny lobster fishery in the EEZ.To avoid the inadvertent potential for a limited entry system in the EEZ,the Regional Director will issue an identification number and color codefor the spiny lobster trap fishery in the EEZ to an applicant who is notable to obtain a number and color code issued by Florida. A permit numberand color code issued by Florida and valid in Florida's waters remainsvalid for use as an identifier in the EEZ. However, a Federally issuednumber and color code is valid only in the EEZ. The proposed rule to implement the FMP (47 FR 1088, March 12, 1982) containeda requirement that an application for a Federal number and color code mustbe submitted to the Regional Director by a vessel owner or operator ona form available from the Regional Director and that an application mustbe submitted to the Regional Director 45 days prior to the date on whichthe applicant desires receipt of the number and color code. No public commentswere received on this aspect of the proposed rule and it was adopted asa final rule, contained in andSection; 640.6(b). Because of the aforementionedNOAA policy, applications for Federal numbers and color codes were notexpected. Accordingly, OMB approval of the ICR for applications was notrequested at that time. Subsequently, the Councils submitted and NOAA approvedAmendment 1 to the FMP. One of the measures in Amendment 1 is a requirementfor an annual vessel permit to engage in the commercial spiny lobster fisheryin the EEZ. The permit system included application for and issuance ofFederal numbers and color codes for identification of traps, buoys, andvessels in the permitted fishery. OMB approved the ICR of the permit systemand issued OMB control number 0648-0205. The requirement for a Federalpermit to engage in the commercial spiny lobster fishery has not been implementedbecause of incompatibilities between Florida and Federal management regimes.However, that part of the ICR addressing application for and issuance ofa Federal number and color code is now implemented and the OMB controlnumber applies. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>This action is authorized by 50 CFR 204 and 640, and complies with E.O.12291. Pursuant to section 553 (b)(A) and (d)(2) of the Administrative ProcedureAct (APA), notice and opportunity for public comment and the 30-day delayin effective date of this policy statement are not required because itis an interpretative rule and a general statement of policy. Relating tothe Notice of OMB Control Number, the Assistant Administrator finds thatbecause the notice of OMB Control Number portion of this rule is strictlya ministerial action required pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act,it is unnecessary to provide notice and opportunity for comment upon, orto delay for 30 days the effective date of the notice of OMB control number,under the provisions of section 553 (b)(B) and (d)(3) of the APA. Becausenotice and opportunity for comment are not required by the APA or any otherstatute, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this notice.This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O. 12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in CFR 50 Part 204 </ITAG>Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
