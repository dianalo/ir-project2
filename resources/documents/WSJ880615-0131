The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 25.07 to 2124.47, surpassing the prior post-crash closing high of 2110.08 on April 12. The average has been hovering near the 2100 level since last Wednesday.    Trading activity, which had fallen off sharply in advance of the trade data, accelerated as investors snapped up a broad range of stocks. More than 227.2 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 125.3 million Monday. Advancing Big Board stocks swamped losers by 1,104 to 448.    The Dow Jones industrials surged nearly 34 points in the first half hour and remained at sharply higher levels for the rest of the session. A late round of profit-taking erased part of the gain, but prices rebounded modestly at the close.    Broader market averages reached postcrash highs along with the Dow Jones industrials. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.87 to 274.30, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.50 to 154.52.    The Nasdaq OTC composite index and the American Stock Exchange index, which advanced to post-October peaks late last week, added to their gains.    The catalyst for the rally was the report, released before the opening, that the nation's merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $9.89 billion in April from $11.7 billion in March after adjustment for seasonal variations. The monthly gap was the lowest since December 1984, when it was $8.03 billion, and was well below most analysts' expectations.    In contrast to last month, when an equally surprising narrowing of the March deficit on an unadjusted basis triggered a slide in stock prices, investors saw the April trade data as good news.    The reason for the much different reaction, traders and analysts said, was that the narrowing of the deficit in April was due mainly to a 6.4% drop in imports; in March the unexpected improvement stemmed primarily from a 23% jump in exports, causing concern that the economy was expanding so rapidly that inflation would increase and interest rates would climb.    &quot;Last month, there was some question as to whether we were cutting back imports at all. These numbers are more in keeping with what is supposed to happen,&quot; said Peter Canelo, a market strategist at Bear Stearns. &quot;It's not just a seasonal blip. This is for real.&quot;    Traders in other markets saw it that way, too. Both bond prices and the dollar surged. They escaped the degree of profit-taking that hit stocks.    But Mr. Canelo said he doesn't think the profit-taking of recent sessions is a major obstacle to further gains. &quot;I'd rather have the market build a base for a sustainable advance, rather than moving ahead too quickly,&quot; he said.    He added that the selling &quot;probably is leaving a lot of cash in institutional hands,&quot; which could be shifted back into stocks if the bond market continues rallying and interest rates decline accordingly.    &quot;I've been expecting to see more money come in here from institutions right along,&quot; added John Burnett, a senior vice president of block trading at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. &quot;Some institutions have committed some funds here, but basically they're still sitting on their hands.&quot;    Mr. Burnett said he doesn't know why institutional investors haven't been buying more stock than they have, but he added that any pickup in their activity &quot;could keep this market from sliding any significant amount.&quot;    Among blue-chip issues, International Business Machines rose 1 3/4 to 118 3/4, Merck increased 1 1/8 to 56 1/8, United Technologies gained 1 1/8 to 39 7/8, Aluminum Co. of America went up 1 1/4 to 51 7/8, and Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing climbed 1 3/8 to 64 1/2.    Another blue chip, Texaco, was the most active Big Board issue on composite volume of 12.3 million shares, which included a single block of about 7.7 million shares. Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts andamp; Co., which reportedly held a 4.9% stake in the company, was believed to have sold the block, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Kohlberg Kravis declined comment. Market rumors cited several possible buyers, including investor Carl Icahn, who is offering $60 a share for the company. Texaco fell 1/8 to 50 3/8.    Philip Morris fell 1 3/4 to 83 1/4 on Big Board composite volume of 3.9 million shares in the wake of the tobacco industry's first-ever defeat in a liability case.    Liggett Group, which was found partially liable for the lung cancer death of a New Jersey woman, fell 1/2 to 7 5/8. Among other tobacco stocks, RJR Nabisco fell 1 to 47, American Brands rose 1/4 to 45 1/8, and Loews, the parent of Lorillard, eased 1/4 to 65 1/8.    Several chemicals stocks were especially strong, with analysts citing planned price increases as a factor contributing to the gains. Dow Chemical rose 2 7/8 to 90, Quantum Chemical jumped 5 to 94 1/4, Great Lakes Chemical gained 2 3/4 to 61, Vista Chemical climbed 2 7/8 to 56, and Georgia Gulf rose 2 1/2 to 63 1/2.    While technology issues generally advanced along with the market, Hewlett-Packard plunged 3 to 55 3/8 on Big Board composite volume of 2.7 million shares. The company held a meeting with securities analysts, and some analysts who attended told the investor report that they didn't see any signs of improvement in the concern's financial outlook.    Murray Ohio Manufacturing fell 7/8 to 61 1/4. The company now expects to report net income of $3.75 to $3.85 a share this year, compared with an earlier estimate of $4 to $4.25 before costs related to the takeover offer by Electrolux of Sweden and the exploration of alternatives.    Payless Cashways fell 1 3/8 to 24 3/8 on news that a group led by investor Asher Edelman lowered its stake in the company to 9.1% from 9.9%. A management group is considering a leveraged buy-out of Payless, and Mr. Edelman said last week that he might make a competing offer.    Iowa Resources dropped 1 3/8 to 16 1/8. Some analysts expect the company to cut its common stock dividend in response to recent regulatory decisions setting its return on equity at less than 11% and ordering a $19 million rate cut, The Wall Street Journal reported.    The American Stock Exchange index gained 0.74 to 308.88. Volume totaled 13,300,000 shares, up from 8,640,000 Monday. There were 353 issues advancing, 258 declining and 271 unchanged.    Bergen Brunswig gained 5/8 to 23 1/2. The company reported profit from continuing operations of 51 cents a share for its third quarter ended May 31, up from 22 cents a share a year earlier.    ATandamp;E rose 3/8 to 9 7/8. The company said it signed additional lease agreements with FM radio stations for its wireless personal communications system. </TEXT></DOC>
