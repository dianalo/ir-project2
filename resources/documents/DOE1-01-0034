A one-monthintercomparison of dry deposition monitoring and measurement methodsat an Illinois grassland site included a detailed comparison of resultsfor sulfur dry deposition to buckets and other surrogate surfaces, aswell as fluxes measured by micrometeorological techniques (Dolske andGatz, 1984). Sulfur dry deposition fluxes measured by the bucket collectorswere consistently the highest of those measured by the various surrogatesurfaces. This work analyzes a portion of the existing dry bucket dataset to determine the effect of various screening criteria on the frequencydistribution of measured dry fluxes of each measured ion. 15 refs., 8figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
