The economyof wind energy will depend on other energy sources available as wellas the location of the windmill. Windmills made by Tuulitekniikka Kyare located in Kontiolahti, Kotka and in the archipelago near Uusikaupunki.The last one has been the test site. A windmill with vanes of 7 metresin diameter and a capacity of 7 to 10 kw costs about 100.000-120.000Finnish marks to build. The cost is mainly due to labor costs when themills are made one by one or few at a time. As a do-it-yourself projectone can make a simple windmill for heating purposes only for about 25.000Finnish marks. One can buy a ready made windmill with a capacity of 3000kwh at a price of 100.000 Finnish marks. It will probably last for fifteenyears and thus one kwh will cost about 2.2 Finnish marks. The windmillin Kontiolahti has by now produced electricity for 4.5 years withoutany repairs. Due to the absence of an electricity meter no exact productionfigures can be given but the estimate is about 3000 kwh per year. Assumingthat the price of energy is 0.30 marks per kwh the mill has so far yieldeda profit of 4000 Finnish marks.</TEXT></DOC>
