Noranda said the project would cost about one billion Australian dollars (US$811 million). It said the two companies each have a 50% stake in the pulp mill.    A spokesman for Noranda Forest said agreement has been reached between the two companies and the Tasmanian government, which must approve the project, on &quot;all the issues of substance.&quot; He said some obstacles remain to be cleared before a final agreement is reached. He declined to identify the obstacles. The company said it expects to resolve these difficulties before Christmas.    Noranda said the proposed mill's 440,000-metric ton annual capacity would make it the company's second largest pulp venture. The largest is the Northwood mill in Prince George, British Columbia, which can produce as much as 500,000 metric tons of pulp a year.    The mill will begin producing bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp in 1991, Noranda said. Noranda Chairman Alfred Powis said the pulp is used to make higher grades of paper and will be sold primarily in the Far East, but also to markets in North America and Europe.    Mr. Powis said he expects Broken Hill will take &quot;a somewhat larger&quot; role than Noranda in running day-to-day operations at the new mill.    Financing arrangements haven't been completed yet, he said.    Noranda Forest is a pulp and paper company controlled by Noranda, a resources concern. North Broken Hill is a Melbourne-based resources company, with interests in mining, forestry and oil and gas. </TEXT></DOC>
