The viewpoint of binary cartesianproduct file allocation thus produced allowed in the research the creationof allocations for two particular sizes of the set of stores such thatthe average processing time for partial-match queries was smaller thanthat of the best allocation technique found in the literature for thesesame two cases. It also provides a framework in which good allocationsfor other particular sizes of the set of stores, and possibly for generalsets of stores, might be found.</TEXT></DOC>
