REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Corazon Aquino on Mondaywished her exiled predecessor Ferdinand Marcos a happy birthday _ aslong as he spends it outside of the Philippines.   ``As a Christian, I pray that God will give him his blessingsfrom this day,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters on Marcos' 72ndbirthday. ``I am holding fast to what I believe is for the nationalinterest, and that is not to allow Marcos and his family to returnat this time.''   Mrs. Aquino has cited national security for refusing to allowMarcos to return from Hawaii, where he has lived since his ouster ina civilian-military uprising in February 1986.   Marcos has been hospitalized in Honolulu since January withheart, kidney, liver and lung ailments and is reported in criticalcondition.   Nearly 1,000 Marcos supporters held a peaceful rally Monday tomark the ex-president's birthday.   His followers published a full-page advertisement Monday in thenationally circulated Philippine Daily Inquirer extending birthdaygreetings and calling for his return ``in the interest of truenational reconciliation.''   Also on Monday, airports in Manila and Cebu were alerted toprevent a Marcos supporter, who also is related to Mrs. Aquino, fromslipping back into the country from the United States.   Bienvenido Alano, acting commissioner of immigration anddeportation, said the alert was ordered because of reports thatbusinessman Eduardo Cojuangco might enter the country.   ``We have information that Mr. Cojuangco has a plan to return,''Alano said in a radio interview. ``So I alerted immigration officersin Manila airport and in Cebu because the report is he will come invia Cebu. In any case, when we find out that he came in, we willdetain him at the airport.''   Cojuangco, a first cousin of Mrs. Aquino, fled the countryshortly before Marcos was ousted and has been living in SantaMonica, Calif. He has been linked to previous attempts to topple theAquino administration.   In another development, the official in charge of recoveringMarcos' alleged ``hidden wealth'' said his agency will need anincrease of more than $500,000 in its budget to continue the search.   The government claims Marcos and his backers embezzled up to $10billion during the 20 years that Marcos ruled.   Mateo Caparas, chairman of the Presidential Commission on GoodGovernment, asked the House Appropriations Committee to increase hisbudget from $950,000 to $1.5 million for 1990.   Caparas also said the commission needs more than $2 million topay American lawyers representing the Philippines in civil suitspending against Marcos in U.S. courts.   The government has said that so far it has recovered about $133million in cash and the money has been turned over to the landreform program.</TEXT></DOC>
