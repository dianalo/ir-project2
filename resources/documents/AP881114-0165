The Justice Department sent a memo to U.S. attorneys Nov. 4calling for detailed analyses spelling out the financial structureof narcotics trafficking, ``the involvement of legitimate andnon-legitimate businesses'' and other details about drugorganizations.   The directive was based on a recent speech in which AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh asked the prosecutors to outline thecorporate structure of narcotics trafficking ``so that we can fullyeducate the American public.''   The memo from Laurence McWhorter, director of the executiveoffice for U.S. attorneys, says that ``your analysis will become apart of a public document.   ``Your report should be based upon matters of public record ...as well as present investigations to the extent that suchinformation will not compromise sensitive ongoing investigations,''said McWhorter's memo.   ``You should take the extra step of circulating your report in`draft' form to the pertinent law enforcement leadership in yourDistrict to assure an accurate depiction of the problem and to guardagainst disclosure of sensitive information,'' the memo added.   The attorney general wants an interim report by Dec. 19 and afinal report by March 1.   The suggested format for the report includes relevant informationregarding accounting, banking, financing, communication, moneylaundering schemes, payment of `mules,' currency and tax fraud.   It also suggests an explanation of the impact of narcoticsbusinesses on crime, including the ``nature and extent of publiccorruption, if any.''   In his recent speech, Thornburgh said he wants to ``drag'' thenarcotics trafficking business ``out from under the rock where itlives and breeds'' so that the American public ``will betterunderstand and more enthusiastically support the difficult strugglein which we are engaged.''</TEXT></DOC>
