<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-62-1123 </DOCNO><TEXT>A thermocouple assembly for measuring the surface temperature of a firedheat exchanger tube is described comprising, a cold junction end havinga temperature readout instrument and a hot junction end having a temperaturesensing junction member, the ends being connected by sheathed thermocoupleconductors. The sheathed thermocouple conductors include an elongatedtubular metal sheath, and a pair of spaced thermocouple conductors withinthe sheath, electrical insulating material spacing and supporting theconductors within the sheath in insulating relation from each other andfrom the sheath. The hot junction end is defined by a thermojunctiontip. The tip includes a face in which the conductors end, sheath aresubstantially coplanar, a junction member contacting the face and weldedto the conductors at the face. The junction member is spaced from thesheath and insulating means disposed between the junction member andthe sheath to electrically and thermally.</TEXT></DOC>
