The experimental measurements forpure water, along with compressibility data from the literature, wereused to characterize physical adsorption within the Burnett-Isochoricapparatus using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (B-E-T) adsorption model coupledwith the sequential Burnett equations. The resulting adsorption constantswere used to correct the compressibility data for the mixtures and precisevalues were obtained for the second virial coefficients, enthalpies,and other derived thermodynamic properties. Interaction second virialcoefficients, B{sub 12}, and interaction third virial coefficient, C{sub112} and C{sub 122}, were also determined from the mixture virial coefficientsand compared with values obtained values obtained using prediction methodssuch as that by Tsonopoulos (1974). Also, the proper temperature dependencefor the binary interaction coefficient, was established. Dew points (+/-1K and +/- 14 kPa) were also measured for the above mixtures by notingthe change in slope of the isochores. The dew point pressures were predictedusing a priori methods such as that proposed by Eubank et al. (1986)for their natural gas-water mixtures, and compared with other experimentalmeasurements and with VLE prediction methods, such as they by Heidemannand Prausnitz (1977).</TEXT></DOC>
