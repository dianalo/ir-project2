Gilbert, already blamed for at least 11 deaths in the Caribbean,was on a path toward Texas Wednesday afternoon, forecasters said asthe National Weather Service issued a hurricane watch for thestate's entire coastline. But with the unpredictable storm threedays away, authorities met to review evacuation plans acrosshundreds of miles from the southern tip of Texas to New Orleans.   On the Bolivar Peninsula outside Galveston Bay, beachgoers andabout 3,000 residents were urged to leave by sundown and most werecooperating, said Police Chief Farris Collier of Crystal Beach.   The 1,600 students of the University of Texas Medical Branch onGalveston Island and about 200 patients also were being evacuated,said spokeswoman Leann Teymour.   The Army was setting up a ``crisis action center'' in Washingtonto coordinate dispatching active-duty military personnel andequipment from Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, and possibly Fort Blissin El Paso, to assist with evacuations, said Sen. Phil Gramm,R-Texas.   Andy Valence, mayor of the barrier island town of Grand Isle,La., about 80 miles south of New Orleans, ordered a generalevacuation of the island's 2,100 residents and visitors.   Mississippi's Gulf Coast residents kept officials busy answeringphone calls about Gilbert's path.   ``I think people are concerned, particularly after the closecall with Hurricane Florence last week,'' said Dusty Perkins,public information officer for the Jackson-based MississippiEmergency Management Agency.   Tampa Bay area officials, still mopping up from four days oftorrential rains last week, worried that Florida's central GulfCoast communities were especially vulnerable to Gilbert.   The ground remained water-logged, said Bob Anderson, SarasotaCounty's deputy director of emergency management, and floodwatersblocked the only two roads from Manatee County's barrier islandsand other evacuation routes.   Gilbert is a much larger and more dangerous storm than Florence,which hit southeastern Louisiana Friday night, flooding roads andknocking down power lines but doing little major damage.   ``You've got tropical gale force winds all the way out 250miles'' from the eye of the hurricane, said Bruce Piercy of theNational Weather Service in Miami.   Evacuations started earlier this week, when oil companies usedhelicopters and crew boats to take an estimated 10,000 workers fromoffshore rigs.   More evacuation orders were likely Thursday morning, even if thestorm's path remains uncertain, authorities said.   ``You cannot evacuate people at night and you can't evacuatepeople when the winds and rain have already started,'' said PortArthur, Texas, police Lt. B.D. Spradlin.   Grocery and hardware stores were swamped with shoppers andlumber and water supplies were reported in short supply throughoutthe region.   New Orleans residents lined up 10 to 15 deep at check out lanesin one hardware store where plywood for covering windows was thehot selling item.   A caravan of cattle trucks jammed a two-lane road out of coastalCameron Parish, La., where purebreds graze in the lush marshland.   In Corpus Christi, Texas, school was canceled for the rest ofthe week. In the nearby beach resort of Port Aransas, officialshanded out emergency passes to residents leaving town, to controlaccess and prevent looting in the event of a disaster.   Most of the damage would be to homes and low-rise buildings,which are generally designed to withstand winds of up to 90-100mph, said Kishor Mehta, president of the Wind Engineering ResearchCouncil and an associate at Texas Tech University's Institute forDisaster Research.   ``Gilbert could easily cause damage in the neighborhood of $5billion to $7 billion if it hits the right place,'' Mehta said.   U-Haul Marketing Co. President Alan Kirkhart described the sceneat the self-service rental center in Corpus Christi where hisoffice is located.   ``It's almost like a mass panic situation,'' Kirkhart said. ``Wehave so many people calling and coming in here that we had to starta waiting list, and it keeps growing before we can get moreequipment in.''   Because of a shortage of lumber, he said, some Corpus Christiresidents have driven as far as Austin and San Antonio to renttrucks and trailers, bringing plywood back with them to board uphomes prior to evacuating.</TEXT></DOC>
