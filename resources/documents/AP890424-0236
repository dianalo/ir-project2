It was run by an old classmate of mine, John Lyman _ amassage parlor in the Bambi Motel. Since then the motel burneddown. I think the neighbors...probably are glad.''   Moonshine? A Muskogeean, Gov. J. Howard Edmondson, put an end toit by persuading Oklahoma voters to legalize liquor in 1960, thesecond to last state to do so, a step ahead of Mississippi.   ``There's still a little moonshining going on,'' says ChiefSturm, ``but just for home consumption. You know, for tradition.''   Is Muskogee finally catching up to The Song after 20 years,getting straight-laced? ``A nice thought,'' says Sturm.   Even at the time of The Song, at least one potential potpurchaser didn't believe the business about marijuana.   As Lonzo ``Slick'' Smith recalls it, a kid came into hisbarbecue joint and asked where he could get some grass.   Slick has been in business at the same spot on Shawnee Boulevardfor 28 years. His barbecue can hold its own with any in theSouthwest, but it is his only product.   ``I had some old ratty Mexican cigarettes somebody had givenme,'' he recalls. ``They were terrible to smoke and worse to lookat. I handed the kid a few of them and he handed me $5.   ``He never came back, but the word got out that I was dealingthe stuff.''   Over the years, Muskogee's politics have been as rollicking asMuskogee's vice. On one Election Day a ballot box was tossed intothe Arkansas River lest it be counted.   Of all the town's politicians, John Monks would win the prize,although the vote would be close.   Other candidates would include, for example, a Muskogeewatchmaker named Wilbur Wright. Not a bad name for a politician.   In 1970, the year The Song was at its peak of popularity, Wilburpaid the filing fee and entered his name for labor commissioner, anobscure state office long since without purpose but somehow left onthe ballot.   Wilbur won unopposed.   Soon he was caught padding his expense account. He pleadedguilty and resigned.   Not to be dismayed, next election he filed again. His primaryopponent this time was a former state trooper named Will Rogers.Not a bad Oklahoma name either.   In a battle of names, the revered airplane inventor, dead 62years, won over the sainted humorist, dead 39 years.   At length, Oklahoma voters found a sensible solution. Theyabolished the job.   Incidentally, if you should notice an elderly gent wheelingaround Muskogee in a blue pickup with a big yellow palomino horsefor a hood ornament, that will be Wilbur Wright's brother, Orville.   John Monks is a horse of another color.   Monks is a big man with a big voice, square jaw, rusty hair,flashing eyes. He laughs easily and loud. He feels that herepresents a majority of Muskogeeans. ``Hell, they elected me tentimes, didn't they?''   Voters have never had a doubt where John Monks stands on issues.He's against.   He's against the feminists, against their Equal RightsAmendment, against the seat-belt law.``I know seat belts savelives, but people should have the freedom to choose.'' He's against``perverts'' and ``pantywaists'' but insists he is impartial. ``Iinclude both sexes.''   Above all, John Monks, a member of three veterans'organizations, is against communism.   His brightest moment in 20 years in the legislature _ his hazeleyes light up when he recalls it _ was his speech against a bill tooutlaw cockfighting in Oklahoma.   After expounding on the history of the manly sport, he pausedfor effect and delivered his peroration:   ``The first thing the communists do when they take over acountry,'' John Monks thundered, ``is to outlaw cockfighting.''   Simultaneously, he switched on a tape recording of roosterscrowing. In the gallery, his Muskogee supporters waved littleAmerican flags on sticks and crowed along, cock-a-doodle-do.   The bill went down to hilarious defeat.   ``No,'' John Monks confesses, ``Muskogee wasn't the way the songsaid it was, but that was the way it ought to have been.''   While Muskogeeans were sending John Monks to the legislaturethey were also sending Mike Synar to Congress. Rep. Synar is ratedby Americans for Democratic Action to be the most liberal of thenine-member Oklahoma delegation.   ``If you try to categorize our voters, you're on a fool'serrand,'' says Gene Wallace, Rep. Synar's aide in Muskogee.   ``Ninety-something percent of the voters in this district havelived in the same house for 20 years. Home ownership here is higherthan in most places in the United States. Our people understandtheir values if others don't. They like where they live and howthey live and see no contradictions in the way they vote.''   Muskogee, at the confluence of three rivers, grew out of one ofthe territory's oldest trading posts. It was the agency for theFive Civilized Tribes _ the old building still stands, now a museum_ when the U.S. drove those hapless souls out of the East, gavethem the eastern half of Oklahoma, then took great chunks of itback, including Muskogee. The town's population of about 42,000hasn't changed much in decades.   The state's first governor, whose name, Charles NathanielHaskell, is largely forgotten here, was from Muskogee. Merle RonaldHaggard, whose name is widely remembered, was not.   In fact, Haggard, an orphan at 9, spent more time in his youthin San Quentin (two years for armed robbery; pardoned by Gov.Ronald Reagan) than he ever spent in Muskogee.   Haggard's father was born in Checotah, 20 miles south of here.He was a Dust Bowl refugee and his son was born in 1937 in a boxcarin Bakersfield, Calif.   The songwriter, vacationing aboard his houseboat on California'sLake Shasta, was unavailable to talk about Muskogee. However, hisroad manager and drummer the past 21 years, Biff Adams, recallswell the origin of The Song.   ``Merle had the idea in his mind, a song practically written,about small-town America and people who were not hippies orprotesters,'' Adams recalls. ``It might have been any town, and itdidn't have to be literally accurate.''   He recalls the day in 1969 when the band bus was headed northout of Texas on Highway 69 on the way to a gig. They stoppedbriefly in Checotah where Haggard visited an uncle.   ``You wouldn't expect him to write that he was proud to be anOkie from Checotah, would you?'' said Adams. ``It doesn't fit.   But just out of town we saw a sign that said `Muskogee 20miles'.''   ``I bet they don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee,'' Merle Haggardsaid, reaching for his guitar.   The rest of the lines came easy.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 7</NOTE></DOC>
