But for too many businesses these days, one more certainly exists: If they are involved in any kind of dispute, even one involving tax claims, they may be labeled &quot;racketeers&quot; and dragged into federal court like career criminals to defend themselves and their reputations.    As a former prosecuting attorney, I welcomed the latitude Congress gave federal prosecutors in 1970 through the criminal provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to go after white-collar criminals and organized crime. But three years ago I discovered that this same law had revolutionized civil litigation and, in so doing, created a dangerous situation for legitimate businessmen and women.    I had become involved as a defending attorney in the case of a family-owned marina in western Michigan. The state of Michigan prosecuted the marina and four of its salesmen for failing to collect sales taxes, over a three-year period, on eight expensive boats that allegedly were misreported as &quot;sales for resale&quot; or &quot;interstate commerce&quot; -- sales on which buyers are not required to pay state sales taxes. The Michigan attorney general's office contended that the salesmen misrepresented the type of sales to gain a price advantage over competitors.    A jury determined that all of the salesmen were not guilty, but it convicted the corporation on five counts, and the maximum fine of $25,000 was imposed.    The case shocked the owners of the marina, the second largest in Michigan. Since its founding more than 30 years ago by a husband-wife team, the marina had enjoyed an excellent reputation. The husband and wife still owned part of the stock in the marina; the remainder was owned by their two sons.    Then came an even more devastating blow. No sooner had the dust settled, when the Michigan Department of Revenue accused the owners and salesmen of being racketeers, as defined under the civil provisions of RICO. They were charged with filing false sales tax returns and dragged into federal court, where the state demanded that RICO's treble damages and attorneys' fees be assessed against them.    Such a suit seemed impossible to me. Then I read the case of Department of Revenue v. Phillips, in which the federal Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals had reluctantly reinstated the state of Illinois's civil RICO case against the defendant, who was charged with filing false monthly sales tax returns. The court took &quot;solace in the fact that the Illinois Department of Revenue promised in oral argument that such tax collection cases will be few.&quot; However, the judges were skeptical. They added, &quot;We doubt, once the cause of action is established, that this will be true.&quot;    The Seventh Circuit went on to make a fervent plea to federal lawmakers, similar to that offered by the U.S. Supreme Court in its recent decision, H.J., Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. The court of appeals wrote, &quot;We can only hope that this decision appears to Congress as the distress flag that it is, and that Congress will act to limit, as only it is empowered to, the statute's application to cases such as the one before us now.&quot;    Thus far Congress has ignored such entreaties. Fortunately for my clients, however, the state of Michigan voluntarily dismissed its RICO action against the marina after determining that it could not prove the case. Because the individual employees had been acquitted and only the marina had been convicted of any wrongdoing, the state could not, under case law, obtain judgment against the enterprise. Nonetheless, the marina owners suffered considerable public embarrassment and humiliation at being linked in the reporting media to organized crime, as was charged in the RICO complaint. They are still struggling to recover their good name.    Next, Michigan's Revenue Division tried the same tactic against a service station operator and his two stations. This time, a federal judge, Robert E. DeMascio, ruled that the state was improperly trying to use the federal courts to collect taxes and obtain a penalty far greater than anything authorized by the legislature. Judge DeMascio wisely determined that RICO should not be stretched &quot;so far as to encompass a sovereign's attempt to prosecute its own citizens in a federal forum for state sales tax violations.&quot;    He also noted that the Illinois district court (whose decision was overturned reluctantly by the Seventh Circuit), had refused to allow officials in that state to bring a civil RICO action against an alleged sales tax violator. The lower court had reasoned that &quot;RICO should not become a vehicle for federal jurisdiction and damages in state sales tax cases.&quot;    Judge DeMascio predicted that if state revenue departments are allowed to pursue such tactics, &quot;federal courts would be barraged with state agencies' vindictive civil RICO actions against tax cheaters&quot; and would seek sanctions that state laws do not allow.    In other words, if the duly elected lawmakers in Michigan or any other state do not think it necessary or wise automatically to triple the recovery of unpaid taxes or enact a state version of civil RICO, why should they be allowed to seek such remedies in the overcrowded federal courts?    The federal courts never were designed to act as collection agencies for state and local taxes, yet, unless changes are made in the existing civil provisions of RICO, that is exactly what they will become. In fact, not only state governments but local entities as well are lining up to recover trebled local taxes that allegedly have been reduced because of bribes and gratuities to local officials.    Meanwhile, civil RICO continues to attract plaintiffs who want to turn general business disputes that belong in state courts into federal offenses. For example, a small consortium of contractors who consulted me had submitted the low bid for a large marina to be constructed on Lake Michigan. The second-lowest bidder recently filed a civil RICO action, claiming that misrepresentations were made by the successful bidders using the telephone, thereby committing federal wire fraud. No matter what the determination of the suit, the low bidders already have felt the sting of such poisonous words as &quot;racketeer.&quot;    Congress cannot undo the devastation that too many legitimate businessmen and women already have suffered from RICO. But it can prevent the unjust labeling of honest, reputable companies -- by state and local governments as well as by their private competitors -- if it finally limits the vast sweep of civil RICO. The time to reform the law is now.    ---   Mr. Sawyer was a member of the House Judiciary Committee until leaving Congress in 1985. He practices law in Grand Rapids, Mich. </TEXT></DOC>
