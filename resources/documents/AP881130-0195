(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A financial officer for politicalextremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. testified Wednesday he wroteLaRouche in 1984 that he suspected that former Secretary of StateHenry Kissinger was responsible for some of the movement's moneyproblems.   Richard Welsh told LaRouche's conspiracy trial that he suspectedKissinger's involvement after obtaining a copy of a letter Kissingerwrote to the FBI soliciting advice about his own security from theLaRouche organization.   LaRouche and six co-defendants contend that government harassmentimpeded their fund-raising capabilities and is at the root of afailure to pay back the bulk of more than $30 million in loans toLaRouche organizations.   LaRouche and the six associates are charged with conspiring todefraud those who lent the movement money by devising a scheme toavoid repayment.   The Kissinger letter to the FBI was obtained by the LaRouchemovement under the Freedom of Information Act, and admitted intoevidence at the U.S. District Court trial. Dated Aug. 19, 1982, andaddressed to former FBI Director William Webster, Kissinger wrote:   ``I appreciated your letter forwarding the flier which has beencirculated by Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr.   ``Because these people have been getting increasingly obnoxious,I have taken the liberty of asking my lawyer, Bill Rogers, to get intouch with you to ask your advice, especially with respect tosecurity.''   Welsh testified that he sent a memo to LaRouche in October, 1984,in the midst of LaRouche's second of three presidential campaigns.   ``You stated in the memo that Kissinger was behind the actions?''to hurt the LaRouche organization financially, asked Assistant U.S.Attorney Kent Robinson.   ``It was the primary but not the only suggestion I made,'' Welshtestified.   Welsh, however, did not specify how he thought that Kissinger,long a target of verbal assaults by LaRouche, could have createdfinancial problems for the movement by privately expressing concernfor his security.   Welsh also testified that a tax lawyer advised him and otherLaRouche staffers to file federal tax returns even though it was notclear that the law required LaRouche to do so.   Welsh said he met with the tax lawyer to see whether LaRouche wasobligated to file returns even if he had no income and all hisexpenses were paid for by organizations that were part of hispolitical movement.   Welsh told the jury he was told that the assistance to LaRoucheshould be treated as ``ordinary business expenses'' by the companiesand not as LaRouche's personal income.   LaRouche alone is charged in the case with conspiring to defraudthe Internal Revenue Service by not declaring the personal andhousehold expenses he received as income and by not filing federalincome tax returns since 1979.   Welsh said the tax lawyer ``recommended that a tax return befiled, not because it was required'' but because LaRouche was ``acontroversial public figure.''   In an effort to convince the jury that money spent for LaRouche'ssecurity was actually used for his personal expenses, theprosecution called to the stand Kathy Magraw, a LaRouche financialstaffer who testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution.   She acknowledged under prosecution questioning that the securityaccount paid for a $7,000 piano, cufflinks for LaRouche, shoes forhis wife, Helga, clothing, luggage, a $10 haircut for LaRouche andreimbursement for a purchase of wine.   Ms. Magraw said the account also paid expenses for guests whostayed at LaRouche's Leesburg, Va., estate.   Seeking to rebut the argument that the money was used improperly,LaRouche attorney William Moffitt attempted to question Ms. Magrawabout security expenses for two Latin American members of LaRouche'sorganization whose lives had been threatened by drug dealers.   However, U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. refused to allowthe defense to delve into the Latin American figures' backgrounds,thus scuttling efforts to show there were legitimate expenses in thesecurity account that were not for LaRouche's personal benefit.   LaRouche was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud,conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the IRS.The mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters ofcredit sent through the mails by the LaRouche organization.Conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 yearsin prison and fines of $3.25 million for LaRouche.   The six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mailfraud and conspiracy charges, which cover the years 1983 to 1987.   In the tax conspiracy count, the federal grand jury charged thatLaRouche failed to declare as income the personal and householdservices provided by his organizations.   On trial with LaRouche are his chief fund-raiser, William Wertz;his legal adviser, Edward Spannaus; and four fund-raisers: MichaelBillington, Dennis small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.</TEXT></DOC>
