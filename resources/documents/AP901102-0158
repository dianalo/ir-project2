Attorney General Asks FCC to Reconsider Nynex Consent Decree</HEAD><NOTE>EDS: SUBS last graf with 2 grafs to give Nynex comment</NOTE><BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York state officials say that based on newand ``extensive'' evidence of wrongdoing by New York Telephone, theFederal Communications Commission should reconsider a consentdecree that ended its investigation of the New York and New EnglandTelephone companies.   In a filing scheduled for delivery Monday to the FCC, RobertAbrams, the state attorney general, and Richard Kessel, executivedirector of the New York Consumer Protection Board, said New YorkTelephone's violations of commission rules on affiliatetransactions ``was far more extensive and had a far greater effecton NYT's rates than the commission believed when it adopted theconsent decree.''   A copy of the filing made available to The Associated Press onFriday also said the FCC had not given an explanation for agreeingto the consent decree and that it had foreclosed participation byNew York authorities into the investigation of the two Nynex Corp.subsidiaries.   On Oct. 4, the FCC announced that the two telephone companieshad agreed to make voluntary contributions totaling $1.4 million tothe U.S. Treasury. They also agreed to cut their long-distancerates $35.5 million to resolve allegations that they overchargedcustomers through a Nynex subsidiary, Materiel Enterprises Co.   In exchange, the FCC ended its investigation without finding anywrongdoing.   The FCC in February had said it intended to fine the twotelephone companies $1.4 million - a record amount - over apparentviolations of FCC rules governing transactions between regulatedtelephone companies and unregulated affiliates.   The FCC had ordered the companies to return $35.5 million tolong-distance customers because of alleged $118.5 million inovercharges to NYT and NET by Nynex Materiel Enterprises Co.(MECO), an unregulated Nynex purchasing subsidiary.   The companies agreed to the $35.5 million rebate, to be madewithin 30 days, and also said they would reduce their capitalaccounts by $32.6 million to ``remove the alleged excess profits onplant and equipment purchased from MECO.''   Local phone rates were not be affected by the rebates.   A few days before the FCC consent decree, New York state utilityregulators authorized a study into whether Nynex should be forcedto divest New York Telephone.   The new filing said evidence submitted during a rate increaseproceeding show that FCC methodology ``vastly understates theunjust and unreasonable charges ultimately passed on to New Yorkconsumers in their interstate rates.''   As a result, New York long-distance ratepayers ``have paid ratesinflated by NYT's imprudent overpayments to MECO and other Nynexunregulated affiliates.''   An FCC spokeswoman, Audrey Spivack, said the commission had notseen the filing and could not comment.   Nynex spokesman Peter Goodale said by telephone from New Yorkthat he had not seen the filing and could not respond to specifics.But he noted that the telephone companies already had taken stepsto comply with th consent decree, including making the $1.4million payment to the Treasury.   ``We've upheld our end of the bargain and we hope the FCC doesas well,'' Goodale said.</TEXT></DOC>
