(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By J.B.andP;  MilesandM;As bandwidth hunger besets both vendors and users, savvy network managers arelooking well beyond the traditional high-end limits of T-1 transmission toT-3's promised speeds of 44.736M bps or even higher.andM;Analysts and users agree that T-3 networks, or hybrid T-1/T-3 networks, willcatch on in the long term, owing to their lower transmission costs, increasednetwork availability and higher level of network-information integrity.andM;Managers interested in eventually upgrading from T-1's speed of 1.544M bps toT-3 should carefully check the features on today's fleet of T-1 networkingproducts to ensure a smooth transition, said James Davis, a Chicago-basedinformation consultant who spoke recently at a T-1/T-3 seminar in SanFrancisco sponsored by Data-Tech Institute, a computer education and trainingfirm based in Clifton, N.J.andM;The reason for such caution: T-3 is much more than three T-1s strungtogether.andP;  T-1 and T-3 use vastly different protocol sets -- for data''framing'' -- to control the signals responsible for smooth data transfer,Davis said.andP;  Complications can arise when vendors try to develop products forboth transmission methods.andM;''We are in the midst of a major protocol transition to meet higher bandwidthT-3 networking requirements,'' Davis said.andP;  This transition will require thatuser companies upgrade current T-1 channel banks, multiplexers and othernetwork processors to take advantage of the network control and signalingadvantages offered by the T-3 protocols, he explained.andM;Amid such transition, a buyer's best defense is education, he said.andP;  The moremanagers know about how the technologies are the same -- and how they'redifferent -- the easier the transition to T-3 will be.andM;Davis listed a number of categores that network managers should examine asthey seek to buy the most suitable multiplexer or other networking processorfor their present and future networking needs.andP;  These include types ofinterfaces supported, types of framing structures supported, drop-and-insertcapability, point-to-point or multipoint capability, data speeds and theability to support network management.andP;  Managers should look to the popularlyused Digital Signal level 3 (DS3) protocols, designed to meet the signalingneeds of emerging T-3 networks, because these are built upon older T-1protocols such as Digital Signal level 1 (DS1), for 1.544M-bps channels, andDigital Signal level 0 (DS0), for 64K-bps channels.andP;  Both DS1 and DS0 offerframing patterns that are still the basic building blocks for ensuinghigher-bandwidth signaling and channeling schemes, he said.andM;Along with DS3, new transmission schemes that include the same rate andpayload (28 DS1 channels at 1.544M bps) as DS3 protocols include: SYNTRAN(Synchronous Transmission), a synchronous version of DS3 introduced by ATandamp;Tseveral years ago, and SONET (Synchronous Optical Networks), a DS1- andDS0-compatible alternative to the DS3 scheme for fiber-optic technology thatemploys different signaling and framing techniques from either DS3 orSYNTRAN.andM;There are other network signaling and control protocols on the horizon aswell, all of which may or may not involve basic changes in the ways that datapackets are prepared and presented over the network.andP;  ''We are currently inthe midst of a transition from DS1/D4 protocols to DS1/ESF protocols,'' Davissaid.andM;DS1/D4 is a packet-framing scheme based on 12 data frames of 193 bits each(one for signal control and 192 for user data); ESF (Extended Superframe)employs the same basic framing structure as D4, but extends the framestructure from 12 to 24.andP;  This enables a more efficient use of the first, orsignaling, bit for error detection or network-control information.andM;Complicating this situation, especially in the multiplexer world, is the factthat at least three generations of multiplexers have been created since thepublic tariffing of T-1 facilities began in the early 1980s.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
