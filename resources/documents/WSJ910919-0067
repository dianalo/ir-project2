Fierce rival Salomon Brothers Inc. was sinking deeper intoscandal, which could only boost Goldman's standing amongsecurities firms and win it new clients. What's more, Goldmanwas already on its way to record pretax profits of perhaps$700 million to $900 million for the year ending Nov. 30,double what most other major securities firms stand to makein 1991.</LP><TEXT>   But the rumpled Mr. Rubin would have none of it. These arestill &quot;very uncertain times&quot; for Goldman and Wall Street, andthe firm would continue to be run as if disaster were aroundthe corner, he warned the partners gathered in the spartanlyfurnished 30th-floor auditorium. He wasn't kidding: In itslatest penny-pinching exercise, Goldman shocked some topexecutives by taking away their airline guides and otherperiodicals and unplugging their second phones.   Don't be fooled by the glum talk and frugality, though. AsSalomon stumbles in the scandal arising from Treasury-auctionviolations, Goldman Sachs is emerging as the strongest, mostprestigious securities firm on Wall Street. Its dominance ischallenged only by Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and giganticMerrill Lynch andamp; Co.   &quot;What Goldman has always nurtured is an image ofintegrity, which in times like this comes back to benefitthem,&quot; says Kenneth Leibler, former president of the AmericanStock Exchange. M. William Benedetto, a New York investmentbanker, says of Goldman, &quot;They really are the class act onthe Street.&quot;   Goldman has had its own problems, however, including thisyear's hasty shutdown of a junk-bond &quot;vulture fund&quot; thatinfuriated clients, and the still-unresolved Securities andExchange Commission insider-trading investigation of formerarbitrage head Robert Freeman. And no one can be sure Goldmanwon't ultimately be implicated in the Treasury-auctionscandal. But the firm has been mostly unscathed by the majorscandals that, since the mid-1980s, have ripped through manymajor securities firms and toppled more than one set of topexecutives.   Salomon is the latest in a string of major securitiesfirms to slip down Wall Street's totem pole. Such 1980sheavyweights as E.F. Hutton, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,First Boston Corp., the Shearson Lehman Brothers unit ofAmerican Express Co., Prudential Securities Inc. and GeneralElectric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. all had major traumas inrecent years. Hutton and Drexel never recovered.   Goldman's Mr. Rubin and his co-chairman, Stephen Friedman,declined to be interviewed for this article. They respondedto questions about Salomon in a statement: &quot;We absolutelyaren't trying to take advantage of their problems. . . .We're running the business like we always have. We're muchmore concerned with our own business.&quot;   In private, Goldman bankers aren't necessarily so gentle.Salomon investment bankers complain that Goldman and MorganStanley were the two firms that most aggressively sent theirclients free copies of &quot;Liar's Poker,&quot; which depicts Salomontraders as adolescents and gamblers. Goldman denies sendingout the books. &quot;It's not the nature of our people,&quot; anofficial says testily. &quot;Somebody could get fired over that.&quot;   In any case, when Salomon's interim chairman, WarrenBuffett, talks about his vision for a cleaned-up SalomonBrothers, he sometimes sounds as if the blueprint wereGoldman Sachs: tough but low-key, with an almost hokey focuson team play.   In speeches that any Goldman executive would love, Mr.Buffett has said he wants Salomon to retain itsaggressiveness but tone down the aspects of its culture that&quot;some might call macho, some might call cavalier.&quot; Hishand-picked chief operating officer, Deryck Maughan, has eventalked about &quot;a more open, a more cooperative&quot; SalomonBrothers. &quot;I like the term partnership,&quot; Mr. Maughan says.   Appropriately, Goldman is the last major securities firmthat still is a partnership. While others have become eitherpublicly owned (like Salomon, Morgan and Merrill) or units ofconglomerates (like Shearson Lehman and Kidder Peabody),122-year-old Goldman is owned and run by its 146 generalpartners. The advantage of a partnership is that, with topofficials' own money directly at stake every day, theowner-bosses theoretically keep extra close tab onoperations.   Goldman partners take a typically nervous view of thefirm's outlook. It and other securities firms have alreadybeen drawn into the Salomon scandal, in a way; they've beensubpoenaed for information on their dealings with Salomon andhave had to conduct costly reviews of their own tradingoperations. Goldman partners are worried about whetherSalomon officials caught in the scandal, such as formergovernment-securities trading chief Paul Mozer, will try toimplicate Goldman as part of plea agreements. While thefirm's executives vouch for Goldman's ethics, they fear thepossibility of getting pulled into the scandal.   Also, Goldman could easily get immersed in a relatedgovernment investigation, springing from the Salomon matter,into the years of false orders understood to have been placedby Wall Street firms for the debt of quasi-governmentagencies such as Federal National Mortgage Association, orFannie Mae. Most big securities firms and banks, includingGoldman, haven't been following the letter of the law in this&quot;agency&quot; market, and if the government wants to bring casesit can do so easily, Wall Street executives say. Goldman andother securities firms and banks say they support an overhaulof the market's guidelines.   So far, no major clients have publicly renounced Salomonfor Goldman. But major clients of Salomon's nationwide are,in fact, looking elsewhere.   In Maryland, for example, the $13 billion state pensionfund used to send most of its business to Salomon. But now,the state is talking with Goldman and about 10 other majorfirms about shifting the business. A decision isn't expectedfor several months.   &quot;We are actively looking at what the options are,&quot; saysHerbert Dyer, executive director of the Maryland fund. TheSalomon scandal caused him to &quot;step back a moment and ask ifthis is the firm that you thought it was.&quot; He seems to havefewer qualms about Goldman: &quot;They have a special place in ourlineup, because they have always been a premier firm.&quot;   Goldman is already positioning itself to pick up millionsof dollars in business that Salomon has lost. Goldman is oneof the finalists to take over a prestigious role in the saleof British Telecommunications PLC stock, a role that the U.K.government yanked from Salomon after the scandal broke.   Goldman also is expected to lure some Salomon personnel.Just a few days ago, Salomon U.K. economist Thomas Mayer,troubled by his firm's woes, jumped ship for a similarposition at Goldman. Others could follow.   The Goldman partners have little reason to be sympatheticto Salomon. People at Goldman say the firm'sgovernment-securities desk lost millions of dollars in theMay Treasury auction, when Salomon's government deskcontrolled no less than 94% of the available notes. It wasthis auction that led to the scandal. Goldman denies rumorsthat it fired traders after suffering the losses; it alsoheatedly denies speculation that it was the one that tippedoff the Federal Reserve Board to Salomon's auctionviolations.   Until the scandal, Salomon had been vying with Goldman inthe 1991 profits race. Salomon reported first-half net incomeof a record $451 million, easily the best of any publiclytraded securities firm. Goldman, which doesn't have to reportits results, is said to have earned even more than Salomonuntil a slowdown in the past three months. But now it's allGoldman, because much, if not all, of Salomon's first-halfprofits could be wiped out by fines and court settlements.   Salomon's sudden crisis worries Goldman's leaders. Mr.Rubin and Mr. Friedman are completing their first year at thehelm, and in meetings with partners they've repeatedlystressed that a securities firm's fortunes &quot;can changequickly and adversely.&quot;   A major embarrassment for Goldman was its controversialWater Street Corporate Recovery Fund. The $783 million fund,which bought junk bonds of troubled companies and then soughtto influence the companies' managements, infuriated someclients, who argued that the fund created conflicts ofinterest for Goldman. Goldman shut the fund down.   In addition to the Robert Freeman insider-trading affair,Goldman has also had to weather allegations of sexualharassment brought against a partner in 1989. The partnerresigned.   And the firm has caught heat in the British press the pastmonth for not disclosing in a timely fashion a major stake ithas in client Robert Maxwell's Maxwell Communication Corp.The stake was collateral for a Goldman loan to anotherMaxwell company. Goldman's late disclosure of the stakeviolated the U.K. securities law. In a statement, Goldmansays an &quot;unusual situation gave rise to a reportingobligation which was inadvertently overlooked.&quot;   All these problems haven't hurt the bottom line much.Stock and bond trading have produced the bulk of this year'sexpected record earnings. But the investment bankingoperations have come on strong after a weak start early inthe year. The second-biggest U.S. underwriter of initialpublic stock offerings, behind Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc.,Goldman saw its IPO market share soar to 19.2% throughmid-September, up from 12.3% for 1990. It raised $2.38billion for the issuing companies and collected $134 millionin fees, says Securities Data Co.   Despite the recent rebound in investment banking, Goldman-- which had tried to avoid layoffs -- surprised competitorsearlier in the year by cutting its banking staff by about10%; despite some new hirings in recent months, thedepartment's head-count still is down about 7% for the year.   Goldman this year has also made healthy profits in itsforeign exchange and commodity operations -- particularlyoil. Reflecting its focus on commodities, the firm recentlylaunched one of the biggest public-relations drives in thefirm's history to sell investors on a new commodity index andon the virtues of investing in commodity futures.   There isn't any love lost between Salomon and Goldman, andSalomon employees can sometimes be paranoid about theirarchrival. Months before the Salomon scandal broke, Salomon'sMr. Mozer -- now a central figure in the scandal -- got aphone call from a reporter asking questions about thegovernment-securities market. Mr. Mozer refused to answer anyquestions until he checked out the reporter's credentials.&quot;For all I know, you could be a spy for Goldman,&quot; heprotested.</TEXT></DOC>
