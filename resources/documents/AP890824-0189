(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Voyager 2 began its final approach toNeptune today, showing the planet's strange moon Triton to be abright pink, red and blue marble ringed by what could be asnow-covered glacier of frozen natural gas, scientists say.   At 9 a.m. PDT today Voyager was expected to be 472,056 miles fromNeptune, caught in the grip of Neptune's powerful gravity andfalling toward the fourth largest planet at a speed of 38,599 mph.   At 8:56 p.m. PDT Voyager will pass 3,042 miles from Neptune'scloud tops, closer than it has come to any other celestial object onits 4.4 billion-mile journey from Earth.   Researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory planned anall-night vigil as the most detailed images begin coming back fromthe spacecraft early Friday morning. It takes 4 hours and sixminutes for radio signals from the spacecraft to reach Earth.</TEXT><DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A team of scientists from the United States andCanada believe they have discovered the fatal gene defect thatcauses cystic fibrosis.   The team of molecular biologists scheduled news conferences todayin Toronto and Washington to report on the discovery, details ofwhich are to be published in the scientific journal Science nextmonth.   ``This is one of the most significant discoveries in the historyof human genetics,'' Dr. Ronald Worton, chief geneticist atToronto's Hospital for Sick Children's said Wednesday.   The discovery is a crucial step toward developing either a newtreatment or a cure for the inherited disease _ the most commongenetic defect in whites. About half of those who suffer from thedisease don't live to adulthood.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A move by five grocery chains against asynthetic hormone designed to boost cows' milk production may helpdelay government approval for its commercial use, says ananti-genetic engineering activist.   Five food chains say they are not selling milk from cows treatedexperimentally with the synthetic hormone, Jeremy Rifkin, head ofthe Foundation on Economic Trends, said Wednesday.   Bovine growth hormone, or BGH, is designed to boost cows'production by as much as one-third.   The decision by the food companies, as well as rising concerns indairy states, will ``put a lot of pressure'' on the Food and DrugAdministration to put off final approval of the hormone for generaluse, Rifkin said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The number of elderly people living alone willsurge in the next century, creating more demand for support servicessuch as home care to help them avoid nursing homes, researchers say.   ``The number of frail elderly, elderly with health limitationsand elderly living alone will all exceed the general increase in theelderly population,'' said a report by the Urban Institute, aprivate agency.   The elderly of the next century will have fewer children and willdivorce or remain single more often, leaving many without a``significant caregiver'' and heightening their need for public andprivate services, the researchers reported.   In a study titled ``The Needs of the Elderly in the 21stCentury,'' the researchers called for efforts to help prevent peoplefrom becoming disabled as they age, target services toward those whomost need help, and rework financing so needed services are moreaffordable for the elderly.</TEXT><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bank for children thinks a credit card isjust what its kiddie customers want, but one opponent says teachinga new generation how to borrow is the last thing this debt-plaguedcountry needs.   ``We think it teaches absolutely the wrong message,'' said LorenDunton, president of the National Center for Financial Education, anon-profit group that seeks to promote financial responsibility.   ``Our message is to save now so you can buy later, and they'repromoting the philosophy of buy now and pay later.''   The San Diego-based center plans to use its branches in 50 statesto ask parents and teachers to oppose a plan by the Young AmericansBank to provide credit cards to children ages 12 and older.   But the Denver-based bank, whose customers are all young people,said it is trying to teach the proper use of credit as part ofpersonal finance.   ``Our feeling is that credit cards are really a way of life, anda lot of us learn about credit in an undesireable way ... withoutany supervision or control,'' bank president Linda Sanders said.``Here that is done with control.''</TEXT></DOC>
