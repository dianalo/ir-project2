Tuck,the undersecretary of energy, told a nuclear industry group.   Tuck, in his first major public address since being confirmedlast month as the No. 3 official in the Energy Department, said thedepartment strongly supported nuclear power and would do everythingpossible to help the industry expand.   ``Rest assured that the Department of Energy will at everyopportunity advocate vigorously on behalf of nuclear energy,'' Tucktold the Nuclear Power Assembly, the industry's annual meeting.   ``We will make the case for nuclear power before the Americanpeople, and we will be forceful advocates,'' Tuck said. Hereiterated the department's recent vow to try to prevent New YorkGov. Mario Cuomo from tearing down the Shoreham nuclear plant onLong Island.   Shoreham got its operating license from the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission last month, but Cuomo and the plant's owner have agreedto dismantle it. State and local officials say Long Island couldnot be evacuated in the event of a severe accident.   Lando W. Zech Jr., chairman of the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission, told the nuclear assembly he was concerned by the factthat no nuclear plant had been ordered since 1978 and that nonecurrently was planned. He said the commission's recent decision tostreamline the licensing process could help the industry rebound.   Zech called the licensing decision ``perhaps the most importantchange ever made to the NRC's power reactor licensing process,''and said it would lead to safer reactor designs.   In another development, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., introduced abill Tuesday to abolish the NRC and replace it with a NuclearSafety Agency headed by a single administrator. He said thefive-member commission and its staff had undermined publicconfidence in nuclear power by becoming too cozy with the industry.   A similar bill passed the Senate last year but died in the House.</TEXT></DOC>
