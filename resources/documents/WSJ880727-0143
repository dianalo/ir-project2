A spokesman for the Canadian Association of Smelter andamp; Allied Workers said there &quot;definitely&quot; won't be a strike today by the company's 1,600 unionized workers. But he cautioned that major issues including wages, job security and pensions remain unresolved. Negotiations are continuing.    The Kitimat smelter produces 270,000 metric tons of aluminum, or about 25% of Alcan's Canadian output.    The union spokesman said the two sides agreed that a contract reached by Sept. 5 will be retroactive to July 24, when the previous three-year contract expired. Earlier, Alcan said it wouldn't agree to make a new contract retroactive.    A mediator, who was called in Monday at the company's request, left when the union refused mediation of the dispute, an Alcan spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
