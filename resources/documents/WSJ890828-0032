Ghattas, a key suspect in connection with the Kloeckner andamp; Co. oil trading case, can be extradited to West Germany, according to a Swiss Supreme Court decision.    The high court rejected an appeal by the Lebanese oil figure that sought to block a decision by the Swiss Justice Ministry to hand him over to West German authorities.    Mr. Ghattas, 58 years old, was arrested in Geneva in March at the request of authorities in West Germany, and a formal extradition request was submitted May 31. The Swiss Justice ministry granted the request June 26. He is accused of leading an illegal oil-trading scheme that cost West Germany's Kloeckner andamp; Co. 600 million marks ($306.8 million).    A spokesman for the Swiss Justice Ministry said Friday that Mr. Ghattas is expected to be extradited to West Germany in &quot;a couple of days.&quot; Meanwhile, he said, Mr. Ghattas remains in jail in Geneva.    A Gatoil spokesman said no immediate reaction to the decision was available. </TEXT></DOC>
