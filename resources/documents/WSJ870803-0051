Construction of the new shuttle will incorporate improvements ordered after the Challenger's destruction in the January 1986 accident that killed seven crew members and grounded the shuttle program.    Rear Adm. Richard Truly, chief of NASA's shuttle program, called the decision &quot;a major milestone in our return to safe, reliable and effective space flight.&quot;    NASA is modifying the other shuttles in its fleet and has said it plans to resume launches next year.    Pittsburgh-based Rockwell, which built the Challenger and the other orbiters, will begin work immediately and is expected to deliver the orbiter within 45 months.    The contract injects new life in the Rockwell shuttle operations. The aerospace, auto parts and defense concern began its space shuttle program in 1972, when it received a contract to develop and produce the first four shuttle orbiters. The last orbiter in that contract, Atlantis, was delivered in 1984, at which time Rockwell essentially closed its Palmdale, Calif., shuttle assembly plant. Rockwell did continue supplying spare parts for the shuttles.    As a result of this new contract, the Palmdale facility will reopen in 1988 with employment peaking at 1,000 in about 1989. Another 1,000 employees will be working on the shuttle at Rockwell's Downey, Calif., facility. Only 500 new jobs in total will be created. Edward Kennedy, a Rockwell spokesman, said many of those working on the shuttle in Palmdale will be those currently constructing B-1B aircraft.    New safety features will include improvements in onboard computers and changes in the brake materials, but essentially the shuttle will be the same as earlier orbiters.    Mr. Kennedy said between 45% and 50% of the $1.3 billion contract will go to subcontractors.    Contracts to be awarded later for engines and additional components will bring the shuttle's total cost to about $2 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
