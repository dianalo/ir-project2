KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate is racing the clock in a bid toratify the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty in the dozendays remaining before President Reagan meets with Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow.   The last obstacles to beginning floor debate were swept awayMonday, ending a process of intense scrutiny that began soon afterthe treaty was signed in early December.   Three Senate committees told Senate majority leader Robert C.Byrd, D-W.Va., that last week's agreement in Geneva betweenSecretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard Shevardnadze satisfactorily resolved disputes about how toimplement the treaty's on-site inspection provisions.   Byrd then announced he would call up the treaty for debatesometime today.   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty, signed atthe White House on Dec. 8 by Reagan and Gorbachev, would requirethe elimination of all U.S. and Soviet missiles with a range ofbetween 300 miles and 3,400 miles.   The decision to begin Senate floor action on the pact followedtestimony in which Shultz said that in the Geneva talks, ``we gotwhat we needed and wanted.''   Shultz said that included both the on-site inspection and aSoviet agreement that medium-range weapons using such futuristictechnology as particle beam generators are banned by the treaty.   Both issues had delayed consideration of the treaty on theSenate floor with Byrd vowing not to schedule action until theywere resolved.   Byrd said Monday that he had been assured by the Senate ForeignRelations, Intelligence and Armed Services committees that theproblems had in fact been resolved.   ``I feel satisfied that we're justified in taking up the treatyand I plan to do so,'' Byrd said.   Byrd said he hoped the treaty could be ratified by the May 29opening of the Moscow summit but could not guarantee it.   Finishing the treaty by the time of the summit will depend onthe nature of the debate and the number of amendments that areoffered, he said.   Byrd said he plans to call up the treaty and stay on it butnoted there may be some roadblocks.   For example, he said that if President Reagan vetoes the tradebill, an attempt to override that action would take precedence overthe treaty and would interrupt its consideration.   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said he may seek to make the Sovietdiplomatic note resolving the futuristic weapons issue a part ofthe treaty itself.   He said he would offer a reservation to the treaty of the kindthat requires agreement by the Soviet Union before the pact can gointo effect.   Chief U.S. arms control negotiator Max Kampelman told Warnerthat would send a potentially disruptive message to the Sovietsthat they cannot be trusted.   But Warner said the issue had taken five weeks to resolve andshould be nailed down.   Testifying before the Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday,Shultz reminded senators they shouldn't be alarmed at a rough spothere and there as the two superpowers struggle to put the treatyinto action.   ``We are breaking new ground with this treaty,'' Shultz said.``On-site inspection is a major step forward in arms controlagreements. We shouldn't be surprised if this process isn't alwayssmooth.''   But he said that as a result of the Geneva talks ``we and theSoviets not only agree on the rights and obligations established inthis treaty, but also on procedures to carry them out.''   ``The bottom line is that the verification provisions of thistreaty get the job done,'' he said.   In another development, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., dismissingallegations by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said there is no evidencethat a recent test of a Soviet sea-launched cruise missile from aland-based launcher violated the treaty because it flew less thanthe prohibited 300 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
