(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Brothers David and James Taggart will getto tell their side of the story this week in their trial on chargesof evading taxes on money diverted from the PTL ministry to financetheir lavish lifestyle.   After more than a week of compelling prosecution testimony in thebrothers' federal trial on tax-evasion and conspiracy charges,defense attorney Ben Cotten will begin his case sometime Monday.   ``I think there will be some surprises, just as there have beensome surprises on the prosecution side,'' Cotten said during a breakThursday.   He said in his opening statement that the case was not abouttaxes, but was ``a case about authorization, intent and doubt.'' Hesaid witnesses and documents would show his clients hadauthorization to use PTL credit cards and take out cash advancesfrom the highest levels at PTL.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter gave the jury the day offFriday. The prosecution was expected to rest its case after abouttwo hours of additional testimony Monday.   It's been more than two years since the Taggarts were fired byPTL following the resignation of Jim Bakker, the founder of thetelevision ministry which once took in more than $175 million inannual donations.   Bakker and Richard Dortch _ his former top deputy at thenow-bankrupt television ministry _ are scheduled to go on trial Aug.28 in Charlotte on 24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy.   The Taggart brothers joined PTL in the late 1970s as pianoplayers. Within a few years, David, 32, was Bakker's top personalaide and James, 35, became PTL's interior decorator.   Both were fired when the Rev. Jerry Falwell took over at thetelevision ministry after Bakker resigned in March 1987 followingrevelations of the Jessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.   Following a 16-month grand jury investigation into PTL'soperation under Bakker's leadership, the Taggarts were charged lastDecember with conspiracy and evading $487,000 in taxes.   They are accused of diverting more than $1.1 million in PTL moneyto their own use from 1984 to 1987 by taking large cash advances andusing blank ministry checks to pay off personal bills, and notreporting that money on their tax returns.   PTL financial officers have testified that David Taggartroutinely took large cash advances and failed to provide receipts tosubstantiate the advances, which was PTL policy.   Peter Bailey, PTL's vice president of finance during most of thetime the Taggarts were at PTL, testified that he once wrote off$215,000 in unsubstantiated cash advances to David Taggart.   Bailey testified the younger Taggart used four blank PTL checksto pay $140,000 in American Express bills.   Witnesses also testified that James Taggart was paid $10,000 amonth for his design work at PTL's Christian retreat in nearby FortMill, S.C.   Dozens of shopkeepers and friends of the Taggarts testified thatthe defendants went on spending sprees in the most exclusive storesin New York City, Florida, California and Europe.   They always stayed at the nicest hotels and dined in the mostexpensive restaurants, prosecutors say. On one occasion, theychartered a private jet to take them and a friend to dinner inLaguna Beach, Calif.   Prosecutors charge the Taggarts also used money donated to thetax-exempt religious organization to buy a $640,000 condominium inNew York. They also owned a $330,000 home in Charlotte and regularlypurchased hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of jewelery anddesigner clothes for themselves and friends, prosecutors say.   If convicted, the Taggarts each could be sentenced to 25 years inprison and face fines totaling more than $1 million.</TEXT></DOC>
