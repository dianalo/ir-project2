Among the projects was a600-square-foot prehistoric cave that Wozniak commissioned scientists from theCalifornia Academy of Sciences to build for his three children. It cost $1million.;    He also has built a mammoth home video arcade with video andpinball machines and air hockey tables.;    Now, the Apple Computer co-founderand well-known charity benefactor is proposing another massive addition thatwill nearly double the size of his 7,000-square-foot home. The5,625-square-foot addition is rather boring by Wozniak standards -- bedrooms,bathrooms, a family room and a garage expansion -- except for one feature.;   Indoor slide;  That is a two-story slide that loops from the house to a dirtplay yard. Originally it was to be a water slide starting inside the home anddropping to an outdoor swimming pool, but Wozniak decided against the pool,which would have been the home's second.;    Unlike most neighborhoodsquabbles, residents are not perturbed by Wozniak's large addition. Most of itwill be built below ground or into the hillside.;    The residents say theydon't like the traffic congestion created by construction crews along narrowSanta Rosa Drive. Wozniak's home sits at the entrance to the largesubdivision, and they say trucks, construction bins and portable restroomshave cluttered the road nearly non-stop for four years since he moved in.;   &quot;This just seems like another capricious addition unrelated to any real need.Steve just seems to have another idea about how to entertain his children. . .. Will it ever end?&quot; neighbor Jim Solomon asked the Los Gatos PlanningCommission during a public hearing last week.;    'Unable to stop building'; &quot;He seems to be unable to stop building,&quot; said Solomon, one of a half-dozenneighbors to complain at the hearing.;    The recently remarried Wozniak saidhe wants to expand the home because his family has grown.;    Wozniak'sarchitect, Robert Do Amaral, says not that many residents are upset, and infact, the subdivision homeowners group has approved the proposal.;    DoAmaral said he feels the Wozniak project has come under much stronger scrutinythan other projects in the hillside area. Do Amaral and Wozniak have drafted alist of measures they say will address the construction traffic.;    Townofficials say the contemporary, unimposing home, at its proposed 12,560 squarefeet with an additional 1,593-square-foot garage, will be the largest home inthe hilly, 60-residence Alta Vista subdivision.;    Materials flown in;  Theyalso say that in the past, Wozniak has flown in materials by helicopter andplans to do so for his new project, which may prompt officials to createregulations for low-flying air traffic in town.;    The town's planning staffhas recommended approval of Wozniak's proposal, saying it meets the town'scriteria. But at least two planning commissioners expressed doubts about thesize.;    &quot;I don't think the children's shelter of Santa Clara County is thatbig and they have 80 kids living there,&quot; Commissioner Patrick O'Laughlinquipped.;    The commission is scheduled to review the project again July 24.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CONNIE SKIPITARES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910630  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  710  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 30, 199100182132,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
