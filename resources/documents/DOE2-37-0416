Some analytical solutions are available in special cases,but usually a numerical solution is required. In spite of their limitations,these methods are widely used, particularly those based on: (i) continuousscavenging - fully mixed discharge; and (ii) continuous scavenging -displacement discharge.</TEXT></DOC>
