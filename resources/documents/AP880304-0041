The Moslem religious leader said the Koran, Islam's holy book,``forbids recognition of Israel.'' He argued against cooperatingwith peace initiatives aimed at ending the three-month uprising inthe Israeli-occupied lands.   Jarrar's remarks, criticial of the PLO's policy of seeking asettlement, provoked murmurs of disagreement from men sittingcross-legged along the wall of the mosque in this village 10 milesnorthwest of Jerusalem.   The dispute, reflecting deep political divisions of Palestiniansdespite the unity they have shown in confronting Israeli soldiers,soon grew into a shouting match.   It cut short the gathering of more than 150 men, an informaltown hall-type meeting where the heated exchanges continued outsidethe mosque under a tree despite a drizzle.   The first to challenge Jarrar, a charismatic speaker alignedwith the fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood, was a middle-aged manin a white headdress, who asked if there wasn't a peacefulalternative to street violence.   The 39-year-old preacher left no room for compromise and warnedthat anyone who recognized the Jewish state would be considered anenemy of Islam.   ``We don't have any common language with Israel. We have nothingto demand of them. We are in a state or revolt against Israel. Theconflict should continue until victory,'' Jarrar said, his deep,resonant voice cracking with emotion.   A bearded man in his 20s accused Jarrar of breaking ranks withthe Palestine Liberation Organization, which has endorsed aninternational conference to discuss peace with Israel.   ``The PLO represents all the people. There is no Islamic trend.There are only Moslems who support the PLO,'' shouted the youngman, a supporter of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization.   ``I represent the Islamic trend,'' said Jarrar, whose full blackbeard signified his fundamentalist allegiance.   A tall, muscular man rose to disagree with Jarrar's criticism ofSyria and the Soviet Union.   ``We are in need of Syria. There is a PLO delegation visitingDamascus now to create a good atmosphere for fighting Israel Weshould support an alliance with Syria,'' he said.   The man, whose comments indicated he was a supporter of thepro-Soviet Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestinefaction, blamed Jarrar for provoking the dispute.   ``We have differences, it is true. But we are all supporting theuprising and we should not discuss them now,'' he said.   Jarrar attacked the PLO position, saying Arafat only had agreedto a conference after losing his independent base in Lebanon, beingdriven out of Beirut by Israel and out of the northern Lebanesecity of Tripoli by Syria.   ``It's impossible to have a peaceful alternative while we are ina weak position,'' Jarrar said. ``I will not say there is apossibility of a political solution. It would be disastrous underthe current conditions.''   The infighting was also reflected in graffitti spray-painted onwalls near the mosque.   One slogan attacking the peace mission of Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz was signed by the Democratic Front and anotheranti-occupation slogan by ``Hamas,'' which means fervor in Arabicand is used by the Moslem Brothers, a movement founded in Egypt in1929 by a school teacher named Hassan Al Banna.   Israeli officials, especially those of the right-wing LikudBloc, have stressed the Islamic influence in the ongoing riots.They have argued that the fundamentalists threaten Western nationsas well as Israel.   The influence of the fundamentalists has grown since theviolence began Dec. 8. Islamic groups are especially strong in theoccupied Gaza Strip, where there are more refugee camps than in theWest Bank and poverty is widespread.   But PLO supporters appear to be in the vast majority in the WestBank, which Israel also seized in the 1967 Middle East war, andeven Jarrar said the riots were not an ``uprising of the mosques,''as he said some Israeli leaders had claimed.   ``Israel wants to frighten the West by saying thefundamentalists are playing an active role. Israel wants to justifyits oppression by saying they are fighting fundamentalists,''Jarrar said.   He said the riots had damaged Israel's image in the world, hurtthe Israeli economy by robbing it of Arab labor and tourism, andprevented the military government in the occupied lands fromimposing new and more harsh measures.   ``They thought we were sleeping or dead,'' Jarrar said. ``Ifthere is no other benefit of the uprising it is to show that wereject oppression.''</TEXT></DOC>
