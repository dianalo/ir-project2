(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man accused of killing seven people,including his wife and two daughters, will ask a court to awardpermanent custody rights over his surviving daughter to his Mexicanrelatives, his attorney says.   Ramon Salcido, a former winery worker, also is accused ofslashing 3-year-old Carmina's throat and leaving her to die in adump and rock quarry with her sisters. Carmina recovered and isliving with her maternal grandfather.   Public Defender Marteen Miller said Salcido is claiming hismother and his siblings have the same right to rear Carmina as therelatives of his dead wife, Angela Richards Salcido.   Salcido's mother, Valentina Bojorquez Armendariz, lives in LosMochis, northwest Mexico, and is married to a fisherman, EbitasioSeja, Salcido's stepfather. Salcido also has two adult sisters andtwo adult brothers living in or near Los Mochis, Salcido's hometown.   On May 10, Superior Court Judge Arnold Rosenfield grantedtemporary custody of Carmina to Robert Richards, her maternalgrandfather, after the toddler's release from Petaluma ValleyHospital.   The Press Democrat of Santa Rosa said in story published todaythat Salcido will contest any attempt by the court to grantpermanent custody to anyone other than members of his family.   ``She's my daughter and I love her. She's everything I have,''Salcido said in a telephone call to the newspaper Monday night.   Rosenfield set a hearing for Tuesday to determine Carmina'slegal status and permanent custody. Salcido probably will attendthe hearing, Miller said.   ``I'm appalled he's trying to maintain any relationship with herat all,'' said Richards' lawyer, James DeMartini. ``It's beyond mycomprehension.''   Salcido is accused of killing Carmina's two sisters, Sofia, 4,and Teresa, 2. The other victims included Salcido's mother-in-law,Marian Louise Richards; his sisters-in-law, Ruth Richards, 12, andMarie Richards, 8; and a co-worker at Grand Cru Vineyards, TracyToovey.</TEXT></DOC>
