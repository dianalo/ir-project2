Housing starts rose 2.4% in July to an annual rate of 1,489,000 units, the Commerce Department said. Starts of single-family units fell slightly, while starts of multifamily units rose for the first time in three months. The department also revised its June report to show an overall increase of 4.4%. The rise previously was reported at 5.1%.    &quot;That's likely to be the highest increase for the rest of the year as higher interest rates are going to have a much more serious impact on the industry,&quot; said Bob Sheehan, economist at the National Apartment Association.    Single-family units starts in July decreased by 0.8% to an annual rate of 1,089,000 units. In June, this sector saw an increase of 8.5%. In May, the rate declined 8.1%. Single-family construction starts in July were 5.4% below the July 1987 pace.    Economists remain pessimistic about the outlook for single-family housing starts, as this sector is usually more sensitive to interest rates than multifamily housing.    David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said he expects the long-term fixed rate on mortgages to be around 11.5% by the end of this year, and move up to 12% by the middle of 1989.    These rate movements will hurt the industry, Mr. Seiders said, but he doesn't see steep declines because the industry is already operating at a low level. &quot;We're not going to fall off any cliffs,&quot; he said.    Last year, construction began on 1,620,500 units, and this year, industry analysts expect the figure to be around 1,450,000 units. Although interest rates are expected to move up, economists noted that the long-term mortgage rate, which is just above 11% now, is below the 12.5% average rate for the past 10 years.    &quot;The housing sector is a sacrificial lamb every time the Federal Reserve decides to tighten monetary policy,&quot; Mr. Seiders said.    In July, multifamily unit starts rose 18.7%. This industry has been in the doldrums for much of the year because of high vacancy rates and changes in the tax laws. Multifamily housing starts fell 9.5% in June and 22% in May. The rebound in July reflects an easing of backlogs in permit approvals for this sector, Mr. Sheehan said. Last month's multifamily unit starts were 9.5% below that of July 1987.    The number of building permits issued for the various kinds of housing fell 5.4% in July after a revised June increase of 4%. The June increase had previously been reported at 3.7%. Although building permits are supposedly an indication of future construction starts, economists noted that this forecast hasn't been accurate in the past. The number of permits in July fell 6% from a year earlier. Permits for multifamily units dropped 24% in July, while single-family housing permits fell 0.9%.    The numbers are adjusted for seasonal variations. Before seasonal adjustments, the Commerce Department said construction has begun on 877,600 housing units in the first seven months of 1988, down 10.6% from the same period in 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
