(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A United Mine Workers strike against thePittston Coal Group has led to more than 1,180 criminal charges,mostly resulting from civil disobedience tactics reminiscent of the'60s civil rights movement.   The 3{-week-old UMW strike against Pittston operations inVirginia and West Virginia grew increasingly bitter last week as adaylong rally shut down this mountain town where coal trucksregularly rumble down the main street.   Miners' families joined in getting arrested and more than 200high school students walked out to support the union.   ``We're not wanting to violate the law,'' said UMW strikecoordinator Marty Hudson. ``We just want people to know whatPittston Coal has done.''   Union officials say Pittston, the nation's 15th largest coalcompany and second largest coal exporter, has violated labor lawsand refused to bargain in good faith.   Pittston dropped out of the industry's main bargaining group,the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, before talks started ona new contract last year, opting to work out its own agreement withthe UMW.   The rest of the major coal producers have reached agreementswith the union. But 15 months of negotiations have resulted in nocontract for Pittston.   The company canceled health insurance for 1,500 UMW retireeswhen the old contract expired Jan. 31, 1988. One strike deadlinepassed earlier this year when the union agreed to a 60-day coolingoff period requested by the governors of Virginia, West Virginiaand Kentucky.   Both sides agreed that wages are not a major issue in thecontract dispute. The sticking points are job security, employeeresponsibility for paying for health insurance, and Sunday workdays.   The UMW finally called a strike April 5, affecting about 1,700workers in Virginia and West Virginia. It did not strike Pittstonoperations in Kentucky, citing ``strategic reasons'' it will notexplain.   The uses forms of civil disobedience such as the sit-in to drawattention to its cause, but has updated them with new technology.Union officials carry beepers on the picket lines, and some havecar phones. Both sides videotape everything, sometimes aerially,for possible use in court. At times, security guards film picketsfilming guards.   Union members wear camouflage on the picket line, presumably tomake it more difficult to identify individual miners on videotape.   The campaign began April 18, when 37 wives and widows of UMWmembers staged a 30-hour sit-in at Pittston's headquarters inLebanon, in western Virginia.   By Friday, State Police reported arrests on 122 felony charges,mostly throwing rocks at non-union coal trucks, and 1,060misdemeanors, mostly sitting in roads and blocking entrances toPittston mines and coal preparation plants.   Authorities did not know how many people were arrested becausesome were charged more than once.   Arrests Monday sparked a rally at the Dickenson CountyCourthouse in this community just southeast of the Kentucky stateline that was attended by hundreds of sign-toting relatives andsupporters of UMW members.   The next day saw a walkout by students at three high schools whostaged their own rally at the courthouse. On Thursday, 70 studentwalked out at Lebanon High School and staged a rally outsidePittston headquarters.   ``We have said all along, since when they announced they woulduse civil disobedience, that it is merely a predetermined excuse tobreak the law,'' said Pittston spokeswoman Susan Copeland.   She said the UMW has ignored a Dickenson County circuit judge'sorder barring mass demonstrations at 17 Pittston operations.   ``They're just putting themselves above the law,'' she said.   Hudson says the civil disobedience, by keeping union membersoccupied, has prevented violence.   The union also has urged Pittston shareholders to ask at thecompany's May 9 annual meeting how long Pittston can operate duringa strike, even with replacement workers in some mines.   Union officials say their strike fund totals $100 million andcan be boosted at any time by increasing assessments on dues.Striking miners are paid $200 a week from that fund, and the unionis providing low-cost hospitalization insurance for those leftwithout benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
