Because most of IBM's new machines sport high-performance microprocessors that can handle expanded memory, fancier graphics and faster data-storage devices, new databases, spreadsheets, word-processing and communications programs that rival the performance of much larger mainframe computers will be possible.    But there's a hitch. According to Microsoft Corp., which along with IBM is developing a high-performance operating system to tap the full power of the new machines, users won't see the new operating system, much less new programs that run with it, until early or mid-1988.    &quot;It's not an overnight thing. It'll take a while to make all the new applications look really good,&quot; said William H. Gates, chairman of Microsoft. &quot;Still this is a major milestone because it will advance the standard of (personal computers) in general by switching over to a more graphical interface. That is something we've been crusading for for a long time.&quot;    With Microsoft's announcement that software developers will get on Aug. 1 the &quot;tool kits&quot; with which to build programs to run on the new operating system, called OS/2, however, there is at least some light at the end of the tunnel.    Lotus Development Corp., Ashton-Tate and other software companies were quick to say that they plan to write software that takes advantage of OS/2. Among other things, that means spreadsheets that can handle even more numbers, databases or filing systems that can be easily shared by many users and personal computers that can do several tasks simultaneously. Software companies will be disclosing details of their product plans over the next few weeks.    Roy Folk, executive vice president of Torrance, Calif.-based Ashton-Tate, said these new programs might not appear for &quot;a quarter or two&quot; after the final version of the new operating system is released early next year.    The arrival of a new operating system standard fully embraced by IBM also creates an opportunity for current giants of the personal computer applications software -- Lotus and Ashton-Tate -- to be dethroned by upstarts with better products. Microsoft is an equally big player in microcomputer software, but its strength is in operating systems, like OS/2 and the well-known MS/DOS, the internal &quot;traffic cop&quot; that controls the flow of data between the computer's components.    Analysts think Ashton-Tate might be particularly vulnerable, in light of IBM's decision to offer its own extended version of OS/2 that will include the building blocks for databases much like those used on its larger computer systems. Ashton-Tate's flagship product is a database called dBaseIII.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Microsoft shares gained $4 and closed at $95, Lotus rose $1.25 to $25.50 while Ashton-Tate fell $1.75 to $22.25.    Although IBM and Microsoft didn't offer any big surprises yesterday, many in the industry say it will be some time before the significance of all the facets of the announcements are clear. For some IBM users, though, the news has a familiar, disappointing ring.    &quot;The possibilities for new software are enormous, just as they were in 1984 when IBM introduced the PC-AT,&quot; said Richard J. Stuckey, a partner of Arthur Andersen's technical services organization. The AT, like many of IBM's new products, is built around an Intel Corp. 80286 microprocessor and requires the OS/2 operating system to tap its full power. &quot;This is very disappointing and serious for users, who have never gotten the value out of the ATs they paid for, and they still won't get it until 1988,&quot; Mr. Stuckey said.    &quot;The whole software side probably generates more questions than it answers. A lot of the software industry is going to take some time sorting it out,&quot; said Peter Tierney, vice president, marketing, at Oracle Systems Inc., which sells database software.    Indeed, some suggested that the news proved Microsoft's Mr. Gates right in his prediction that 1987 would be &quot;the year of confusion&quot; for the personal computer industry.    Take, for example, IBM's decision to use 3 1/2-inch disks on its new machines, instead of the 5 1/4-inch disks that it has used in the past. Most software companies say they'll offer programs on both sizes, but each of the three big software companies is taking a different approach. Microsoft said it will put both sizes in each box of its business software products. Cambridge, Mass.-based Lotus said it will sell the two sizes separately. And Ashton-Tate said it will sell one package with a 5 1/4-inch disk and, for $30 more, a package that includes both sizes.    Nevertheless, for the short term, nothing much has changed for software companies and their customers. &quot;It's a bend in the road rather than a big break,&quot; said Edward Belove, vice president, research and development, at Lotus, the largest personal-computer software company. Lotus and other companies say they plan to continue to enhance software that runs with the existing DOS operating systems, which still direct the inner workings of some nine million personal computers.    For the next several years, software companies and their customers will be forced to cope with different versions of the same programs. Today's software will run on the new operating system and on the new machines, for example. But software written specifically for OS/2 won't run on old machines other than IBM PCATs and compatibles.    Major software companies said they will offer versions of their programs for both the new and old operating systems. &quot;There is life in the existing DOS world,&quot; said Mr. Belove of Lotus. Companies that buy new machines are likely to pass the old ones down to lower rungs on the corporate ladder, he said.    Over time, though, the companies are expected to concentrate more on the new operating system. &quot;What it means for the customers, essentially, is a fairly painful migration process to the new environment, but it's probably worth it for the advantages they get,&quot; said John Page, vice president for research and development at Software Publishing Inc.    Microsoft's Mr. Gates, who concedes that terminology surrounding the new operating system and IBM's extended version causes some confusion, nevertheless contends that IBM's new products, coupled with its endorsement of OS/2, are &quot;a leadership thing rather than a fork in the road-type thing&quot; for users, software developers and even competing computer manufacturers. &quot;This just reinforces that IBM, rather than trying to close the industry off, is trying to remain the leader in such a way that it's a challenge for everybody.&quot;    Keeping pace with the challenge, however, will be costly for some software companies. &quot;We're always trying to juggle our resources,&quot; said Mr. Page of Software Publishing. &quot;I have to admit that this situation has made that worse. We'll be stretched tighter.&quot;    The software company that stands to benefit the most is Microsoft, which will earn an estimated $75 for each copy of OS/2 it sells. Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's vice president, systems software, said the company won't generate much additional revenue in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1988, but afterward OS/2 should &quot;contribute significantly,&quot; especially after manufacturers besides IBM are licensed to sell the system.    &quot;It's been a real coup for the guys at Microsoft,&quot; said Richard Sherlund, a software industry analyst for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;It just underscores how intimately intertwined the two companies are and how dependent IBM has been on the software expertise of the boys from Bellevue.&quot; (Microsoft was based in Bellevue, Wash., until last year. It now is headquartered in Redmond, Wash.)    IBM's planned extended edition of OS/2, priced at $795, offers database and communications software to make personal computers function better in conjunction with large, mainframe computers. Microsoft will benefit even if users decide to use the extended product because the basic OS/2 still will be required.    If IBM can convince companies to write software that relies on the database and communication portions of the expanded edition, it may have finally a found a way to offer something that the clones, its lookalike competitors, can't. Mr. Belove said Lotus expects to write software that takes advantage of these features. Although the same software could run on any machine equipped with the basic OS/2 operating system, Mr. Belove said, &quot;Those particular functions (the ones available to users with IBM's expanded edition) just wouldn't be available.&quot;    Fred Gibbons, president of Software Publishing, said he was surprised that IBM won't have the expanded edition of the operating system available sooner. (IBM said it would set a date sometime in the fourth quarter.) When it is available, software developers may have to choose between writing for IBM or for the rest of the industry, but for now, &quot;The good news is that the industry standard is still intact.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
