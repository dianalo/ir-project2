Radice also said it plans to file Chapter 11 petitions for most of its other subsidiaries soon. In its filing in bankruptcy court in Miami, Radice listed assets of $302.5 million and liabilities of $291.7 million. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors while it works out a plan of reorganization.    Radice officials expressed disappointment that attempts to meet demands of major creditors had failed. &quot;The company is continuing to discuss with interested parties the acquisition of individual properties, group divisional assets and a controlling interest in the company in an attempt to submit a plan of reorganization that is satisfactory to all parties,&quot; it said.    &quot;While there can be no assurance of the successful outcome of negotiations with such parties, a consummation of these transactions would make available the funds necessary to eliminate or reduce corporate debt and provide the foundation for possible reorganization of the company,&quot; Radice added.    In the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, Radice posted a loss of $6.9 million.    As a result of the Chapter 11 filing, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded the rating on Radice's 14 5/8 % subordinated debentures due in 2004 to Ca from Caa.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Radice closed at 87.5 cents, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
