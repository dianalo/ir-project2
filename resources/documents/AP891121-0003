And the killings of six Jesuit priests during the offensivegalvanized opposition in the United States to continued aid for therightist Salvadoran administration, which must be considered plusfor the leftist rebels.   But the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front paid a highprice for its achievements. They turned densely populated urbandistricts into battlefields, and the lives of tens of thousands ofworkers became a weeklong nightmare of death and destruction.   Residents of Soyapango, Zacamil, Mejicanos and Ciudad Delgado,the humble neighborhoods devastated by the fighting that began Nov.11, were angry at a government that sent warplanes to strafe andbomb guerrilla positions amid their homes.   But those same residents seem to have saved most of theirresentment for the rebels.   ``We just want `the boys' to leave, so we can go back to workand finish raising our children,'' said Porfirio Alvarez as he fledwith his wife and two daughters from Zacamil.   The guerrillas maintained fortified positions in and around acomplex of low-income apartment blocks there for four days.Virtually the entire non-combatant population evacuated under fire.   When it appeared most of the civilians had left, governmentforces subjected Zacamil to a six-hour barrage of bazookas, rocketsand cannon fire that left the complex smoldering and practicallyruined.   ``I know women whose sons are with the guerrillas, and I see howthey worry about their children and suffer when they are killed.They're human too. But because of them, we almost get killed. Ifthey would not have come, this would not have happened,'' saidMarta Rodriguez, sweeping her arm across her humble cinderblockSoyapango home hit by bullets and shrapnel.   It is difficult to imagine that the rebels made many converts inneighborhoods where the fighting was heaviest, but guerrilla chiefFacundo Guardado, interviewed at his command post near Mejicanos,said the display of strength, organization and morale wasmotivating adolescent men and women to ``incorporate themselves''into the struggle.   ``I hold the FMLN in high regard professionally,'' retired U.S.Army Gen. Fred Woerner told The Associated Press last week.   The war ``cannot be resolved militarily,'' said Woerner, whodrew up a strategic plan for the war in 1981 and was head of theU.S. Southern Command in Panama until the end of September.   Woerner said the guerrillas cannot be overcome until the rootsof war _ unfair distribution of wealth and pervasive socialinjustice _ are addressed.   In what appears to have been a response to the insurgent push, asquad of assassins murdered and mutilated six Jesuit priests andeducators considered leftist ideologues by the country's rabidright.   Two witnesses, who for the moment remain in hiding, reportedlysaw men in army uniform commit the massacre.   ``The time has arrived for President (Alfredo) Cristiani to makegood on his promise to control those officials in his governmentand in his party who in a good measure are responsible for thecivil war,'' Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said after theslayings.   ``In a time of reduced foreign aid, we must ask ourselves whatit is we are achieving with the dollars we send,'' said Sen. JohnKerry, D-Mass.   But President Bush said the United States should not ``underminea fragile democracy'' by withdrawing aid, and on Monday the Housevoted narrowly against restricting military aid. But the debate wasbitter and at times personal, and the issue had clearly becomecontroversial again.   The United States has provided more than $3.5 billion ineconomic and military aid to a succession of Salvadoran governmentsthis decade. It is generally conceded, even by U.S. officials, thatthe rebels would have won the war by 1985 had it not been formassive U.S. assistance.   The guerrillas said this year they are willing to abandon armedstruggle and convert the FMLN into a political party in exchangefor sweeping political, economic and social reform.   Rebel and government representatives sat down together inSeptember and October to try to find a way toward peace.   The government rejected the possibility of fundamental overhaulof the reigning system and limited its negotiating position to ademand that that the rebels lay down their arms and join ``thedemocratic process.''   When a bomb killed 10 unionists at a leftist labor federation,the rebels broke off talks.   Pope John Paul II late last week issued a call for truce and anexhortation to both sides to resume peace talks.   Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, saidboth sides have agreed in principle to heed the Pope's call and toaccept the church as mediator.   ``But the means of working this out are complicated and causingus a lot of work,'' Rosa Chavez said Sunday.   The rebel offensive against the capital appeared all but over byearly this week. It did not bring down the Cristiani government,but left it shaken.   With the capital and several provincial cites besieged andparalyzed and a protracted standoff apparently the best the armedforces could manage, leaders of the country's business andindustrial sectors reportedly talked with military and politicalelements about replacing the government with a provisional regime.   Diplomats said discussion of such a change, whether peacefullyor by a coup, was preliminary, a kind of worst-case contingency.But that it was talked about at all is another indication theguerrillas delivered a telling blow.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Douglas Grant Mine has covered the civil war inEl Salvador for two years.</TEXT></DOC>
