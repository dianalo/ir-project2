ThompsonandM;San Francisco -- As expected, U.S.andP;  District Judge William Schwarzer lastweek signed an order paring down Apple's lawsuit against Microsoft andHewlett-Packard, and many industry ob-servers said that all that's left ofthe original copyright-infringement case is a small, and most likelyunwinnable, core.andM;The decision, presented in tentative form in a court hearing the previousweek, reduced Apple's claims against Microsoft's Windows 2.03 to just 11interface elements, including overlapping windows and a few specific iconuses.andM;Schwarzer ruled that 178 other elements in Windows 2.03 would be excludedfrom the copyrightandM;phase of the case because they   are covered by the 1985 Apple-MicrosandM;oft license agreement   underandM;which Windows 1.0 was developed.andM;While outsiders called the decision a stunning blow to Apple, the Cupertino,Calif., company maintained a brave face.andM;&quot;We do not believe that the ruling should have a significant effect onApple's ability to show that Windows 2.03 and Hewlett-Packard's NewWaveinfringe Apple's copyrights,&quot; said Edward Stead, Apple vice president andgeneral counsel.andP;  &quot;When Microsoft moved from tiled to overlapping windows inVersion 2.03, it made a fundamental change that significantly altered theoverall appearance of its Windows product.andP;  Under the court's ruling, thatchange is unlicensed.&quot;andM;To make its case Apple will probably have to persuade SchwarzerandM;to look at Windows as more thanandM;the sum of its parts.andP;  His decision last week appears to point in the otherdirection, but Apple attorneys said they saw grounds for hope, citing inparticular a passage in which the judge wrote, &quot;The court will ...andP;  nowproceed to determine whether the use of those unlicensed visual displays incombination with licensed visual displays infringes Apple's audio-visualcopyrights.&quot;andM;Lawyers for Microsoft, however, are preparing legal moves that could end thecase before it ever gets to a jury.andM;Microsoft attorney David T. McDonald maintained that there are legalarguments for why the remaining interface elements are not Apple's tocopyright.andM;For example, he said, Apple cannot copyright windows if they are an idea thatcan be expressed only in a finite number of ways.andP;  &quot;Off the top of my head, Ithink there are only two ways to do windows: tiled or overlapping,&quot; he said.andM;In similar situations involv-  ing disputed software, he said, courts havedisallowed exclu- sive copyrights as anti-competitive.andM;Other industry observers view the question of originality as Microsoft's bestdefense against Apple's remaining claims.andM;&quot;It's well-known that the inspiration for the Apple Macintosh came fromXerox,&quot; said James Pooley, a Palo Alto, Calif., attorney specializing inintellectual-property cases.andP;  By continuing to pursue its claims, he said,&quot;Apple looks not only overly aggressive, but also hypocritical.&quot;andM;Whatever the outcome, analysts said, the case may have little significance tothe rest of the industry because the unusual licensing agreement has turnedout to be so central to the dispute.andM;The question will remain whether competitors who do   not sublicenandM;se through Microsoft, like HPandM;and IBM, are potentially infringing on Apple copyrights.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
