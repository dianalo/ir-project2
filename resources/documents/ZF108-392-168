 Industry analysts suggest theproblem is not so much the MRP II guidelines, but the inaccuratedata sources and shoddy implementation technique employed by manysoftware developers.andP;  Though fewer than two percent of the processmanufacturers (who comprise 40 to 50 percent of the world'smanufacturing plants) utilize MRP II software, part of the reasonis the difficulty they have in finding software that is suitablefor their particular operations.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     AutomationProcess ControlComputer-Aided ManufacturingResearch and DevelopmentStrategic PlanningCAD-CAMSoftware Design.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Automating manufacturing has never been easy, from the time early19th-century English weavers wrecked power looms for fear of losing theirjobs.andP;  Today's problems are less violent than the Luddite revolt, but just asreal.andM;Nor are troubles confined to the factory floor.andP;  A vital aspect ofmanufacturing automation is planning and control.andP;  This has gained muchattention in recent years, thanks partly to North American panic aboutJapan's successes.andP;  But the technology has had trouble delivering.andM;Right place, right timeandM;The first phase was Material Requirements Planning, or MRP.andP;  This was a mixof planning techniques and computer software to get materials to the rightplace at the right time.andM;It evolved into Manufacturing Resources Planning, with a broader scopecovering equipment, materials and labor.andP;  Since the initials were the same,this was dubbed MRP II.andM;But, perhaps because early adopters expected too much, MRP II has caused manydisappointments.andM;&quot;I think we were somewhat naive in what it would do,&quot; admits Colin Reay,market development manager at Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Inc. in Mississauga,Ont.andM;MRP II &quot;hasn't lived up to the promise,&quot; says Morris Berengut, a formerconsultant and now director of engineering at Women's College Hospital inToronto.andP;  He sees two reasons for that: high expectations and poorimplementation.andM;&quot;It's been blamed for a lot of things,&quot; agrees Ben Kaminski, president ofCAM-I Inc., an Arlington, Tex.andP;  research consortium ofmanufacturing-automation vendors.andP;  &quot;But it's a victim.andP;  It's a victim of baddata: it can't operate if it doesn't have the information it needs.&quot;andM;Too many MRP II users put the systems in place without taking a hard look atdata sources that would feed them, Kaminski says.andP;  They fell victim to thegarbage in, garbage out syndrome.andP;  MRP II systems gave poor results becausethey were fed inaccurate data.andM;&quot;We automated a mess and we had a faster mess,&quot; Reay says, &quot;and we had a veryexpensive mess.&quot; When outputs were inaccurate, adds Neil Kidwell, partnerresponsible for the Canadian industrial products practice of AndersenConsulting in Toronto, MRP II lost credibility.andM;&quot;It takes a lot of discipline,&quot; says Ron McArthur, program manager forcomputer-integrated manufacturing at IBM Canada Ltd. in Markham, Ont.andP;  Ifanything changes and the MRP system is not updated, &quot;the next time yougenerate a plan you're not going to be fully utilized or you're going to beoverbooked.&quot;andM;One problem for some users has been the difficulty in finding MRP II softwareto suit their own operations.andP;  Until the past couple of years, most MRPpackages were aimed at discrete manufacturers -- those who produce distinctunits such as bicycles, cars, chairs or computers.andP;  Process manufacturers --steelmakers, textile plants and most food processors, for instance -- had tojury-rig the software to meet their needs.andM;Support addedandM;John O'Connor, manager of manufacturing and financial systems at ChristieBrown andamp; Co. in Toronto, says when his company looked for an MRP II systemthree years ago, Prism, from Marcam Corp. of Newton, Mass., was almost theonly one made for process industries.andP;  Since then, he adds, other MRP vendorshave scrambled to add support for process-oriented plants.andM;The key difference is that Prism and systems like it do not depend on a workorder for each unit of output.andP;  Work orders work well in discretemanufacturing, but won't fit the process model.andP;  Instead, software forprocess manufacturing allows a more continuous schedule.andM;John Cingari, director of marketing for Marcam, says fewer than two per centof process manufacturers use packaged MRP II software.andP;  The reason, he says,is that a system designed for discrete manufacturers &quot;just does not work&quot; ina process environment.andP;  Yet process manufacturers make up 40 to 50 per centof the world's manufacturing, Cingari says.andM;Slow emergenceandM;Kidwell echoes that estimate.andP;  Process shops may account for more of Canadianmanufacturing than in other countries, he adds, thanks to our resource-basedeconomy.andM;Packaged MRP II software for process industries emerged slowly becauseprocess firms tend to be large, Cingari says.andP;  They developed their ownsystems, so the market did not attract package software vendors.andP;  Now thathas changed.andM;O'Connor says the jury is still out on the benefits of MRP at Christie Brown.andO;But he will say the company has learned something along the way.andP;  At first,MRP II was seen as technology to solve a problem.andM;&quot;We quickly realized that wasn't the answer,&quot; O'Connor says -- the answer hadto do with the whole way the company operateRd.andM;By zeroing in on education, communication, policies and procedures, hereports, &quot;we are starting to run the business better.andP;  We are working hard onour forecasting, for example -- we found that was an area that the company asa whole was weak in.&quot;andM;Christie Brown uses MRP II software in one of five Canadian plants so far:the headquarters plant in Toronto.andP;  That is the most complex operation,O'Connor says, and the company has spent a lot of time working out the bugs.andO;&quot;We believe now that it's a matter of rolling it out.&quot;andM;Having recognized the needs of process manufacturers, software developers canstart thinking about just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing.andM;Brock Telecom Ltd., a Brockville, Ont.andP;  telecommunications equipment maker,is starting to try out JIT.andP;  John Cousins, MRP II project manager at Brock,says MRP tools still provide paltry support for JIT.andP;  He feels the bestanswer will be to bypass the MRP II scheduling and use other methods more inline with JIT.andM;But IBM's McArthur thinks MRP II systems can adapt to handle JIT.andP;  The majorneed is to schedule in finer detail, he says, but &quot;I've seen JIT work withouthaving to go to daily planning.&quot;andP;  HP's Reay agrees.andP;  &quot;We really don't have tothrow everything away because we're going just-in-time,&quot; he says.andM;In their book Reinventing the Factory: Productivity Breakthroughs inManufacturing Today, Roy L. Harmon and Leroy Rd.andP;  Peterson of AndersenConsulting write &quot;many companies are finding that MRP II and just-in-time arecomplementary when MRP II is used for planning and JIT is used to manageexecution in the factory.&quot;andM;Kidwell says while existing MRP II software offers little support for JIT,the just-in-time concept can actually make MRP II work better.andP;  &quot;What mostcompanies have not done is figured out how to marry the two successfully,&quot; hesays.andP;  But JIT helps simplify operations, and once that is done MRP II willactually work better, he adds.andM;Manufacturers should start by simplifying the process, Kidwell advises.andP;  Thenthey should use MRP II for forward planning but rely on JIT for &quot;pullingmaterial through the factory.&quot;andM;MRP II will always be the main planning tool, says David Cahn, manufacturingand distribution marketing manager at Computer Associates International Inc.andO;in Garden City, N.Y.andP;  MRP II systems need links to software made for JIT, headds.andP;  Cahn says CA has those links today in its CA-CAS (ConsolidatedApplication System) MRP II software.andM;For years experts have preached the need to integrate manufacturingautomation, rather than installing systems in isolation.andP;  Users are startingto get the message, though many installations remain unintegrateRd.andP;  &quot;Many ofthese areas like engineering research will go off and get a CAD system and doelectronic design and do it better and cheaper and all that,&quot; McArthur says,&quot;and then they'll print it on paper.&quot;andM;Kidwell agrees that &quot;the term islands of automation still applies prettywidely.&quot;andP;  Perhaps this is not all bad: Kidwell says firms should focus onsimplification, automation and integration, in that order.andP;  Tying it alltogether right away may not be necessary.andP;  Companies should be careful,though, to have long-term plans and make sure what they buy can fit togetherlater.andM;Among the most useful areas of integration, Kidwell says, is linkingcomputer-aided design systems with materials planning and shop floor control.andO;Cahn at Computer Associates agrees that many CA clients want to link CAD andmaterials planning.andM;&quot;Integration of data is conceptually not difficult,&quot; Kidwell says.andP;  &quot;Thepractical matter is there's just a huge amount of work involved in goingthrough and building the specific bridges and gateways you need.&quot;andM;A key to doing this is establishing standards.andP;  The Manufacturing AutomationProtocol (MAP) and Technical and Office Protocol (TOP) are among thebest-known attempts, but neither is widely used yet.andP;  Another effort,Kaminski says, is the Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support (CALS)standard, being driven mostly by the U.S.andP;  government.andP;  Cahn adds that aParts Data Exchange (PDX) standard now in its second major review will helptie computer-aided design systems to other parts of the operation.andM;&quot;In the area of standards I think there's an awareness that's reallydeveloped in the last two years,&quot; Kaminski says.andP;  But standards move slowly:vendors are &quot;still fighting among themselves as to what the standards shouldbe,&quot; Kaminski says.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
