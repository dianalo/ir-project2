SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Army announced Monday it has temporarilygrounded its entire fleet of AH-64 attack helicopters while itinvestigates the cause of a crash in Florida last week.   The AH-64 Apache is the nation's newest and most sophisticatedhelicopter gunship. The Army now has 486 of them in its inventory.   The grounding follows last Thursday's crash in northern Floridaof an Apache gunship assigned to the Florida National Guard. Theco-pilot was killed and the pilot was seriously injured when thetail rotor came off the aircraft, the Army said.   The Army said it is analyzing the tail rotor assembly from thegunship that crashed in Florida. The enginering study is expected totake ``several days'' to complete, the service added, but could befinished in as little as two days.   The Apache fleet was last grounded in August 1987 whileinvestigators studied the failure of one component of the tailrotor. The Army said Monday, however, it had already ruled out thatproblem as a factor in last week's crash.   The Apache fleet was grounded twice in 1986, both times forrelatively minor problems.   The Apache is replacing the Cobra helicopter gunship as theArmy's primary attack helicopter. Designed to destroy enemy tanks,the Apache is a twin-engine copter and is loaded with Hellfire andHydra 7 missiles and a 30mm cannon.   It is built by McDonnell Douglas Helicopters, formerly HughesHelicopters, and costs roughly $13 million apiece.   The Army said its engineering analysis was being performed at theCorpus Christi, Texas, Army Depot under the guidance of the U.S.Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala.   While the Army has acquired 486 Apaches to date, 94 of those arecurrently out of service because of damage sustained during a freakwind storm on May 13 at Fort Hood, Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
