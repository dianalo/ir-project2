But it may not be an easy sell.    Since the crash, firms have been promoting a host of gold-linked investment vehicles as a way for investors to reduce risk in their overall portfolios. They've stepped up their marketing of gold coins and bullion, introduced new gold mutual funds, and promoted &quot;asset-allocation funds,&quot; which hold gold as part of a diversified asset mix.    This new push is part of a continuing trend to present gold as a legitimate, long-term &quot;defensive&quot; investment, rather than a short-term speculative one. While that isn't a new idea for many foreign investors, it differs from the traditional view in the U.S., where private investment in the metal was illegal until 1975.    &quot;No Swiss banker would be caught dead without a little gold in his portfolios,&quot; says Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors Inc., which manages gold mutual funds. By contrast, says Michael Freedman, president of Sheffield Management Co., conventional wisdom in the U.S. has held that &quot;only weirdos and kooks bought gold.&quot;    But skeptics believe that the push to polish gold's image is more the result of brokers' trying to drum up new business than a lasting change of heart about the metal. They say that while gold may provide a hedge against inflation, that's about all it does over the long run -- and thus investors may be better off with other long-term investments.    So far, continued softness in the price of gold indicates that U.S. investors haven't been enticed by the latest gold promotions. After their experience in October, investors &quot;still feel misled and confused by the financial establishment,&quot; says Steven Lake, vice president of the investment division at the World Gold Council, a mining-industry trade group. &quot;It's a sort of shoot-the-messenger syndrome.&quot;    Not that anyone can blame them. Investors who were led to believe that holding gold mutual funds would protect them in a market downturn were sorely disappointed Oct. 19. When the crash came, the mining stocks that make up the bulk of gold funds' holdings fell an average of 40%, several points worse than the market overall.    &quot;One of the biggest misconceptions in this business is the belief that gold stocks give the same kind of portfolio protection as the physical metal&quot; in terms of being insulated from stock market moves, says John Sack, first vice president and head of the retail precious-metals desk at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.    In the three months, six months, one year and five years ended June 30, precious-metals funds -- which concentrate mainly in gold -- were the worst performing of any of the mutual-fund categories tracked by the Mutual Fund Sourcebook, a quarterly survey of funds.    The metal itself has proved to be a somewhat better hedge against stock-market turbulence. The price of gold rose after the crash, for example, to $480 an ounce in October and to $500 an ounce at year end, compared to about $460 in August 1987. But the metal didn't sustain its gains for long and soon slumped again, to its current level of about $430 an ounce. The price remains under pressure because of increased production world-wide, and because the Federal Reserve Board's tough anti-inflationary policy makes gold less attractive by keeping interest rates high.    Still, a growing number of market professionals and many academics argue that, long term, gold has a place as a &quot;fringe&quot; holding -- generally about 5% of total assets -- in every diversified portfolio to protect against disaster.    Over long periods of time, they note, gold tends to closely track the price changes of a market basket of consumer goods. This aspect makes it a good store of value in times of political or economic unrest, particularly in times of high inflation.    Also, the metal's price tends to be negatively correlated with financial markets. When stocks and bonds do poorly, gold fares well, and vice versa. This means that even though the price of gold itself is very volatile, it can reduce the overall volatility of an investment portfolio when combined with paper assets. That's the rationale for including gold in asset-allocation funds, which diversify the mix of traditional balanced funds to include not just domestic stocks and bonds, but also real estate, foreign stocks and gold -- both bullion and mining companies.    Financial advisers suggest that investors looking for such diversification on their own should hold coins or bullion rather than gold funds because -- as seen in October -- these funds tend to track the stock market. Mr. Nichols, however, notes that some of the new funds may provide better hedges than in the past; he says that those that have hit the market since the beginning of the year have much more flexibility than older funds to hold gold bullion, rather than mining stock. While many older funds can hold no more than 10% of their assets in bullion, some newer funds have upper limits of as much as 49%.    Asset-mix specialists, however, are divided over whether gold investing really makes sense as a long-term holding in individual portfolios. While gold may be an effective hedge, it doesn't generate earnings or pay interest, so, over the long run, it isn't likely to rise in value by any rate greater than inflation. In other words, ignoring short-term speculative price swings, gold's real expected return -- or the return after inflation -- is close to zero. Consequently, investors shouldn't expect to reap high returns by holding it long term.    Wealthy investors with sizable international portfolios may benefit from the diversification that gold can provide, investment professionals say. But small investors, who may have most of their net worth in personal property, money-market funds and other short-term savings instruments, are likely to find that these assets behave similarly to gold in tracking inflation -- and therefore they may not need the extra protection.    &quot;I think it's disingenuous and self-serving to say investors should have 5% to 10% of their portfolios in gold at all times,&quot; says Charles Clough, Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist. &quot;If you're defensive, cash works fine.&quot;    Because gold's expected return after inflation is nearly zero, &quot;I'm not sure gold is a good long-term investment -- it's more of an emotional thing, a substitute for Las Vegas,&quot; says David Carisio, president of Fidelity Investor Centers, the discount brokerage arm of Fidelity Investments. In November, the company began offering gold bullion and coins to its customers.    Some widely published studies claim that gold does have positive inflation-adjusted returns, but the claims are based on the experience of the past couple of decades. What the studies don't stress is that &quot;while gold may have been the top performing asset in the past 15 years, that's because, unlike other commodities, it came from a base price that was unchanged for 40 years,&quot; says Michael Sherman, Shearson's chief investment strategist. The price was officially set at $35 an ounce in 1934, and it was held at that level for many years in a controlled market that put the dollar and gold at the center of the international monetary system.    When the controlled market began to fall apart in 1968, &quot;gold had to catch up with all the inflation that had taken place,&quot; Mr. Sherman says. But now, he adds, any cyclical gain in gold's price above the pace of inflation &quot;is basically speculation on future inflation.&quot;    ---                        Good as Gold?
