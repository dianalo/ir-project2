But the way their leadersconfronted crisis suggests the transition to democracy ismore advanced, and less vulnerable, in Argentina.   Faced last month by a rebellion by infantry officers, Argentina's President Raul Alfonsin was obliged to cede. Realizing his three-year-old democratic regime had no control over the armed forces, the president hastily drafted legislation aimed at ending human-rights trials that have infuriated the military. He acted because, in the view of his friend Alfredo Ferro, &quot;justice at any price and for all accused officers would mean an end to democracy.&quot;    Thus, the limits of democratic strength in a country long wracked by coups were demonstrated. The military, largely, got its way. Thousands of murders committed between 1976 and 1980 will go unpunished. &quot;This was dangerous,&quot; says Gary Wynia, Professor of Latin American politics at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., &quot;because history tells us if you cede to the military, they (the military) end up in the Casa Rosada Presidential Palace.&quot;    But the crisis also indicated that Argentine democracy has taken hold. President Alfonsin, through his own popularity, was able to call millions out into the streets to protest the rebellion and discourage an escalation.    For the first time in a half century, a civilian regime proved it was popular enough to prevent any party, class or interest group from making an open or tacit alliance with the armed forces. In what military expert Carlos Floria calls an &quot;unprecedented development,&quot; the army stood isolated and civilians united.    The reasons are rooted in recent Argentine history. The armed forces' &quot;dirty war&quot; against leftist subversion, its disastrous handling of the economy, and its humiliating defeat in the 1982 Falklands War left a lasting conviction among most Argentines that military government doesn't work. This has been reinforced by the country's good fortune in finding a president widely regarded as both competent and charismatic. He in turn has chosen a shrewd economic team that without fanfare has brought inflation down to its lowest level in 12 years.    Brazil, where the military handed over power to civilians in 1985, is different. Military rule, though widely resented, wasn't traumatic, and the current economic and political crisis has revealed that some nostalgia for authoritarianism exists. President Jose Sarney, who unlike President Alfonsin was not elected by the people, is widely regarded as weak and incompetent, and his popularity is at a low ebb. Finally, a series of economic teams have succeeded only in producing an annual inflation rate of over 800% that is clearly destabilizing.    President Sarney's reaction to this situation has increasingly appeared to be a growing reliance on the armed forces. He has used them to quash strikes, and they have responded with fervent declarations of alle giance. This process, in the view of many analysts, culminated this week with the president's declaration that he will stay in power for five years, or until 1990, whether the country's directly elected constituent assembly likes it or not.    Mr. Sarney, whose term was to have lasted until 1991 under an accord worked out with the former military government, claimed this was a gesture of compromise with the many politicians pressing for presidential elections next year and a handover in 1989.    But it was widely interpreted as an authoritarian move, distancing the president from the democratic assembly with the backing of the armed forces and some state governors. It was also a clear personal retreat to a more hard-line position. In 1985, the president had said he thought the assembly should determine the length of his mandate and that he personally favored a four-year term ending in 1989. He appears to have changed his position out of weakness.    So, while Argentina's fledgling democracy faces the problem of integrating the military into a society that has a stable leader, government and economy, President Sarney is governing a country undermined by inflation and institutional confusion in which his authority is at best uncertain.    His decision has set the scene for a possible constitutional crisis. Backed by the armed forces, he will be contested in congress and among the general public. Unlike President Alfonsin, his rule is tied to accords with former military rulers and his stand for democracy is therefore less clear-cut.    The economy is in chaos. At worst, some believe, the President's rule could degenerate into that of a figurehead for the military.    A coup, however, is generally ruled out, as it is in Argentina. The armed forces don't want one, nor does the bulk of society, and international pressure is against it. But while Argentina's democratic experiment seems slowly to be gaining strength, Brazil's now appears tenuous and confused. &quot;It's always said that Brazil is too big for the abyss,&quot; comments businessman Lawrence Pih. &quot;But the abyss is growing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
