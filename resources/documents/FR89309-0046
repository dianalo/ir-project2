Pursuant to 10 CFR Part 1022 (DOE's``Compliance with Floodplain/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements''),DOE has determined that this action would involve activities within a floodplain/wetlandsand, therefore, the following notice is submitted for public review andcomment.In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain/wetlandenvironmental review requirements (10 CFR Part 1022), DOE will preparea floodplain/wetland assessment for this site. The floodplain/wetland assessmentwill be incorporated into the environmental assessment to be prepared forthis proposed action. Maps and further information are available from DOEat the address shown below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Any comments are due on or before March 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Address comments to the Pittsburgh Energy TechnologyCenter, Department of Energy, P.O.

Box 10940, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, (412) 892-5709.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The proposed project is a field evaluationof the effectiveness of gas reburning-sorbent injection (GR-SI) technologiesin controlling NO<T2>x</T2> and SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from a coal-fired boiler equipped with a cyclone combustor.The evaluation will be conducted at City Water Light and Power (CWLP),Lakeside Station. Lakeside Station includes three coal-fired steam generatingelectrical units with a total net generating capacity of 100 MWe. The projectwill be conducted in Unit 7, a 33 MWe cyclone-fired boiler.Lakeside Station and the adjacent Dallman Station occupy a 75-acre siteon the northwest shore of Lake Springfield in Sangamon County, Illinois.Coal combustion and flue gas cleaning wastes are transported to an existingon-site waste disposal area located immediately north of Lake Springfield.This disposal area includes three ash ponds for wet disposal of fly ashand bottom ash from the two stations, and three dry landfill cells fordisposal of dewatered flue gas desulfurization sludge from Dallman Station.The flood zone map from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for theLakeside Station area shows that the power station is not located withinthe floodplain. However, the waste disposal area is located within the100-year floodplain of Lake Springfield, i.e. an area with a one percentchance of being flooded in any one year.The power station area does not contain wetlands. However, informationobtained from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service indicates that the existingash pond and dry landfill cells contain wetland areas. The ash pond containswetlands that are classified as lacustrine littoral unconsolidated shoreseasonal diked/impounded wetlands and lacustrine limnetic unconsolidatedbottom permanent diked/impounded wetlands. The dry landfill cells containwetlands that are classified as palustrine unconsolidated bottom intermittentlyexposed diked/impounded wetlands.The Illinois Department of Conservation, which compiled the wetlands mapfor the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, indicates that the ash pond andlandfill wetlands are so identified because they contain standing water,and not because they support aquatic life. The ponds and landfill cellswere excavated for the purpose of waste disposal, and did not contain standingwater or support aquatic life prior to excavation.Project construction will involve retrofit to the existing power plant.All construction will take place in the immediate vicinity of the boilerexcept pipeline installation, which will involve on-site construction ofa 1400-foot natural gas pipeline. Once the equipment has been installed,the GR-SI demonstration will operate for a period of 12 months.Construction of the GR-SI equipment will involve internal structural retrofitof the existing plant. The natural gas pipeline will be constructed entirelywithin the boundaries of the site and will not traverse floodplains orwetlands. The only project activity with the potential to impact the floodplainor wetlands involes use of the existing ash pond and dry landfill cells.Gas burning is not expected to change the properties of either the flyash or bottom ash produced. Sorbent injection will not affect the bottomash, but the fly ash will be altered to contain appreciable amounts ofcalcium sulfate and unreacted sorbent. The sorbent-modified fly ash willbe similar in character to the flue gas desulfurization scrubber sludgenow produced at the adjacent Dallman Station. Thus, the by-product materialsto be produced by Lakeside Station, Unit 7, during the GR-SI demonstrationproject will have esentially the same characteristics as the materialsnow generated at the CWLP plant.During the GR-SI demonstration, fly ash from Unit 7 will be collected dryand placed in the landfill cells. Bottom ash will continue to be sluicedto the ash pond. The annual waste generated by the CWLP plant during theGR-SI demonstration is expected to result in a 3.0 percent decrease inthe wet dispoasl requirement and an 11.2 percent increase in the dry disposalrequirement. The waste placed in the dry disposal cells as a result ofthe GR-SI project will consume approximately 0.5 percent of the remainingusable volume and will shorten the life of the cells by approximately 0.15years.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued at Washington, DC, this 2nd day of March, 1989, for the UnitedStates Department of Energy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.
