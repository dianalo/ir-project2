As a symbolic gesture, though, it gave employees the right to put no-smoking signs around their workspace.    That policy accomplished little. &quot;Smoke is no respecter of visible boundaries,&quot; a spokesman laments, and gripes continued -- from some nonsmoking employees, who make up 72% of the work force. Since then, Boeing has gotten tougher, imposing flat no-smoking bans at two subsidiaries.    Buffeted by complaints from nonsmokers and concerned about new studies of health risks, companies are concluding that they have to face the issue of smoking in the workplace. But what kind of policy they should adopt -- if any -- raises delicate management issues and has produced disparate corporate responses.    A halfway policy like Boeing's, for instance, often just aggravates nonsmokers. But a total ban risks offending smokers. Managers are also grappling with such intricacies as: Should a cigarette vending machine stay? Should smoking be allowed in company vehicles? What should be the policy when there are many small, far-flung offices?    &quot;To put in any policy requires changing corporate culture, and that's never easy,&quot; says John Pinney, executive director of Harvard's Institute for the Study of Smoking Behavior and Policy.    Many companies, as well as the tobacco industry, say the only policy that's needed is one that allows workers to exercise common sense. For instance, &quot;If a company has complaints, maybe moving a nonsmoker under an out-take air duct will resolve it,&quot; says Brennan Moran, a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute.    But other companies say that smokers and nonsmokers alike will accept restrictions -- if implemented correctly. That means, in part, plenty of employee communication, advance warning and free stop-smoking classes. Proponents of such rules claim that corporations stand to gain in the way of healthier and more productive workers, less absenteeism and lower insurance and maintenance costs.    A survey by the private Bureau of National Affairs last summer found that 36% of employers had smoking policies, and an additional 21% were studying them.    Those numbers are expected to rise considerably. Last week, in what is believed to be the nation's strictest smoking policy, the New York Public Health Council adopted rules that would require companies in the state to restrict smoking to designated areas. About 10 other states also have no-smoking policies.    And in December, the Surgeon General issued a report that linked an increased risk of lung cancer with inhaling cigarette smoke in the air. Among other concerns, that report has sharpened companies' fears of health-related suits from nonsmokers. The Tobacco Institute says scientists haven't proved that passive smoking poses any health risks.    The issue was also highlighted last month when Chicago-based USG Corp. announced that workers at its USG Acoustical Products Co. may be dismissed unless they stop smoking totally. USG defended the policy on grounds that mineral fibers used in producing acoustical tile might be especially hazardous to smokers.    Most companies approach the issue far more gingerly. Fellowes Manufacturing Co. in Itasca, Ill., for instance, adopted a no-smoking ban in December after studying the issue for several years, including conducting an employee survey and hiring a consultant. The company was originally concerned that a restrictive policy would anger smokers, and managers didn't like the idea of adding one more work rule, says James Fellowes, president of the closely held maker of office products.    But nonsmoker complaints, he says, combined with the &quot;growing evidence of the dangers and health risks of indirect smoke,&quot; persuaded the company. Beginning March 1, smoking will be permitted only in the cafeteria. On April 1, smoking will be banned everywhere, except during inclement weather when use of a smoking area will be provided.    The company rejected the more widely used option of providing special smoking rooms. &quot;The rooms inevitably fill up with smoke no matter how much ventilation, and they can be expensive to build and operate,&quot; says Mr. Fellowes. Their presence can also tempt smokers, leading to more unscheduled work breaks and antagonism from nonsmokers.    Other companies, like Texas Instruments Inc., feel the cost of such rooms is worthwhile because they provide a better place for smokers than forcing them to go outside the building. &quot;Our feeling was we needed to accommodate those who wanted to smoke,&quot; notes Gilbert Perkins, personnel director for the company's materials and control group in Attleboro, Mass.    Fellowes, like many companies, has tried to frame its policy so as not to alienate smokers. &quot;We've been very careful to describe it as a clean-air policy, rather than a no-smoking policy,&quot; says Mr. Fellowes. &quot;If any employees want to smoke away from the building, it will have no bearing on their employment.&quot;    That philosophy extends to cigarette vending machines. The company will keep them, hoping that lower demand will prompt the vending company to remove them. &quot;That removes us from the question of whether we are dictating personal habits,&quot; says Mr. Fellowes. (Boeing, on the other hand, dropped its vending machines, feeling it would be hypocritical to provide access to cigarettes.)    Despite pressure from nonsmokers, many companies contend that a total ban on workplace smoking is unenforceable and disruptive. New England Telephone Co., for instance, allows smoking in hallways and some bathrooms. The company felt that with 9,000 smokers, about one-third of its employees, enforcement would have been impossible, says Carlo Galvani, a manager for special projects.    Other companies say enforcing a smoking policy is no different from enforcing any workplace rule, and that violations are rare in any case.    But companies typically find themselves revising policies to satisfy employees. New England Telephone's original policy allowed smoking in all restrooms. After nonsmokers complained of heavy smoke in some bathrooms, however, smoking is now permitted only in restrooms on every other floor. Smoke wafting over hallway partitions also forced the company to permit hallway smoking only where the walls reach to the ceiling.    The company has also allowed managers to bend the rules in &quot;innovative&quot; ways to please both sides, says Peter Bertschmann, vice president for human resources. In some areas workers are allowed to leave for &quot;30-second breaks&quot; to take a few puffs on a cigarette.    Some companies, like International Business Machines Corp., have preferred a &quot;hands-off&quot; policy. Smoking at IBM is banned in clearly public areas, like elevators and copier rooms. Otherwise, employees are free to work out any conflicts, but nonsmokers' wishes prevail.    Smoking-policy advocates argue that such plans often lead to patchwork situations. Robert Rosner, executive director of the Smoking Policy Institute in Seattle, tells of one company in which the legal department permitted smoking while the public relations department -- some 10 feet away -- didn't.    Perhaps the most annoying policy in the eyes of nonsmoking advocates is one that permits smoking in private offices. &quot;That raises the ugly head of elitism and leads to erosion of employee morale,&quot; contends Rita Addison of Clean Air Associates, a Boston consulting firm.    Federal Express Corp. disagrees. It prohibits smoking in most areas but allows it in private offices, without loss of employee morale, says Fred Rine, managing director of health and safety. He adds that the policy fits the company's organizational structure. &quot;With 40,000 employees and 700 to 800 locations, you just can't police something like that,&quot; he says.    ---                          Off Limits   Companies with smoking policies currently restrict smokingin:    Meeting rooms                                 22%    Storage areas                                 20    Reception areas                               19    Hallways, aisles                              18    Open office areas                             15    Cafeterias                                    14    All areas                                      8   Source: Administrative Management Society</TEXT></DOC>
