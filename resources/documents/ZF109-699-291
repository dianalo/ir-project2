Enhancements Hewlett-Packard (HP) continues to take advantage ofits headstart in the Unix integrated office system market.andP;  NewWave Officefor HP's Unix platform (HP-UX) has been available since June, making HP thefirst major computer systems vendor to have its own integrated office systemon Unix.andP;  (See the April issue, Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  4, for a full review of NewWaveOffice).andP;  IBM and Digital Equipment still do not have Unix office offeringsother than third-party products such as Uniplex.andM;HP recently made some new announcements to enhance NewWave capabilities andclarified time frames for future products.andP;  The company also emphasizes thefact that its NewWave products are consistently shipping on time.andM;UNIX/386 SERVER.andP;  HP has added Unix/386 to its list of NewWave Office serverplatforms.andP;  HP has always intended to port OpenMail to Unix/386 (see&quot;OpenMail&quot; below) and will now expand its offering on this platform to afull-blown version of NewWave Office by mid-1991.andP;  In addition to mail, thiswill include shared resources (available now through LAN Manager/X andNewWave for DOS), network object-sharing, networked PC management, and someform of Information Access.andM;The company sees tremendous demand for the 386 Unix platform, certainly morethan for OS/2.andP;  One major benefit will be a scalable solution for Unixstarting at the 386 level up through the HP9000/800 series.andP;  HP anticipatesthat NewWave Office for Unix/386 will be available through its dealer channelas well as directly from HP.andM;THE NEWWAVE DESKTOP.andP;  The NewWave desktop software is the front-end clientsoftware for NewWave Office that provides the iconic/graphical userinterface, Object Management Facility (OMF), and the Agent facility.andP;  Thisstill runs only on DOS.andP;  The developer's kits for the NewWave desktopenvironment on Unix (OSF/Motif) and OS/2 (Presentation Manager) will ship inthe first quarter of 1991.andP;  We would expect to see the end-user NewWavesoftware on these platforms six to nine months later.andP;  These will be thedistributed versions of NewWave, using the Apollo Network Computing System(NCS) remote procedure call as the core technology.andP;  HP will implement a fulldistributed solution on Unix; OS/2 will involve a phased approach, with atleast some distributed components initially and the infrastructure to fullysupport distributed objects in the future.andM;HP expects the development of NewWave applications on both Unix and OS/2 toramp up much faster than it did on DOS.andP;  One reason is the excellentacceptance of NewWave on DOS and the fact that HP will not have to spend asmuch time and energy educating developers on the benefits of NewWave.andO;Committing to NewWave on DOS also required a commitment to Microsoft Windows.andO;Until the introduction of Windows 3.0, some of the larger DOS softwarevendors were torn between Windows and OS/2, and were reluctant to commit toWindows.andP;  Developing for NewWave on Unix and OS/2 does not entail the samegut-wrenching decision since Motif and Presentation Manager are pretty muchgivens on those platforms.andM;NewWave AdvanceLink.andP;  AdvanceLink is HP's terminal emulator for accessinghost applications.andP;  A NewWave version of AdvanceLink (on DOS only, initially)will be available for both Unix and MPE servers in the first quarter of nextyear.andP;  In addition to the terminal emulation capability AdvanceLink hasalways provided, this graphical user interface will add the followingcapabilities:andM;* The ability to include host applications in Agent tasksandM;* Cut-and-paste data transfer between host applications and otherapplications on the NewWave desktopandM;* The ability to execute a file transfer to the host simply by picking up anobject on the desktop and dropping it on the terminal emulator iconandM;NewWave AdvanceLink will also have a more robust command language fordeveloping programs that involve host applications.andP;  HP sees the systemadministrator using this to write terminal emulation programs and deployingthem to end users.andP;  The bottom line here is additional support from HP tolink existing applications into the NewWave environment without having torewrite these applications.andM;Information Access.andP;  HP's promised NewWave Information Access client will bedelivered by the end of this year.andP;  Currently, Information Access is anencapsulated application on the NewWave desktop.andP;  One significant benefit ofthe NewWave version will be the ability to use Agent tasks to storerepetitive queries and to integrate query results with reports, spreadsheets,etc.andM;OPENMAIL.andP;  HP is continuing its efforts with Uniplex to port its OpenMail toother Unix platforms.andP;  The objective is to make OpenMail the de facto Unixmail system.andP;  OpenMail will be available on IBM's AIX, Apollo Domain, SCOUnix/386, and Xenix/386 by the end of this year.andP;  Targeted for implementationin 1991 are Sun 3, Bull xps, Digital Ultrix, Pyramid 3X, ATandamp;T, MIPS 120, NCRTower, Altos 2000, and Convergent Technologies.andM;NewWave Mail.andP;  NewWave Mail, which provides a full graphical NewWave userinterface to the electronic mail system, is currently available for the MPENewWave Office server, connecting to the DeskManager mail transport.andP;  HP hasalso announced that the NewWave Mail client will be available for the UnixOpenMail server as well.andP;  This is in beta test now.andM;NETWORK PC MANAGEMENT.andP;  Currently, all NewWave Office client components(e.g., the NewWave environment and NewWave Mail) can be transparentlyinstalled from the server by the system administrator.andP;  The next enhancementwill be to enable the administrator to transparently install third-partyclient software on the network.andP;  The administrator will package up thesoftware, store it on the server, and indicate who and/or how many users canaccess the software.andP;  End users will then be able to access the WorkstationManager and see what third-party software they have access to.andP;  When a userpicks a third-party program, NewWave Office will download the software to theuser's workstation and configure it as appropriate.andP;  It will also keep trackin a database of the number of copies in use and limit the number of users tothat authorized by the administrator.andM;Transparent network installation of third-party software will be available onUnix and MPE servers by March 1991.andP;  It will also be implemented on theUnix/386 and OS/2 servers.andP;  The Workstation Manager is designed by HP to beserver independent (as is network object storage), enabling the company toeasily move it to other operating platforms.andM;The Workstation Manager will not initially use the HP/Apollo Network LicenseService (NLS) since NLS is currently only available on Unix and doesn'thandle the downloading of software to the PC.andP;  Merging the WorkstationManager with NLS is the next step, and it will most likely occur late nextyear.andM;IMAGE ARRIVES.andP;  HP's first NewWare document service, Advanced ImageManagement System (AIMS), is now available on HP-UX.andP;  HP AIMS is a toolkitfor creating image-capable applications that includes a 4GL and auser-interface builder.andP;  Currently, the front end runs on DOS and the serveron the HP9000 (HP-UX), with support for SCO Unix/386 coming.andP;  The clientsoftware is encapsulated and will be a full NewWare application in thefuture.andM;HP states that 10 VARs, including Arthur Andersen, have already signed up forAIMS development, and that 12 customers have systems installed.andM;Future enhancements to AIMS (by the end of this year) include:andM;* Software decompression.andP;  Images are sent across the network in compressedform to reduce the load on the LAN, and compression/decompression iscurrently handled by a hardware board in the PC workstation.andP;  With softwaredecompression, a PC without the board will be able to view the image as wellas convert it to a format that the PC can manipulate, such as Tagged ImageFile Format (TIFF).andP;  The only limitation will be that a PC without the boardcannot send the image back through the network since the board is requiredfor recompression.andM;* SCO Unix/386 support.andM;* Fax support (through HP OfficeFax; see &quot;Fax Gateway&quot; below).andM;* HP ScanJet and LaserJet support (for input/output) with the addition of newdrivers.andM;* OCR support through a third-party card (Calera).andM;* Support for HP's new rewritable optical disk, providing large storagecapacity for images.andM;FAX GATEWAY.andP;  HP OfficeFax is a new fascimile server that provides access tofax services for any mail user on the network.andP;  The fax server consists of aboard (Gammafax CPT fax card) and the HP OfficeFax software installed on adedicated PC (minimum is an AT compatible).andP;  The server can connect to eitherOpenMail on HP-UX or DeskManager on MPE.andP;  To the mail transport, the faxserver looks just like another remote user to whom mail is routed.andM;There are two benefits here.andP;  One is the ability to get network fax servicesthrough a single fax gateway.andP;  Another major benefit is the fact that anymail user on the network--including those on terminals and Macs--can accessthis fax server.andM;Electronic outbound fax material (text and graphics) can be sent directly tothe server by any user on the network.andP;  Incoming faxes are converted to TIFFand can be automatically stored, printed (on LaserJet or DeskJet for highquality output), or routed to the administrator for further handling/routing.andO;Faxes then routed to a PC user can be viewed, printed, or converted to anASCII format if the user has software that handles TIFF files.andP;  Theadministrator must handle all incoming faxes for terminal users (i.e., printand distribute, or route the fax to the user's printer).andM;Additional features include the ability to send any outgoing documents toboth facsimile machines and HP mail address simultaneously, the ability tospecify a time for sending the fax, automatic addition of a cover sheet,redial capabilities for busy phone lines, and confirmation of successful andunsuccessful fax transmissions.andP;  HP also provides administrative functionsand a full tracking system for fax traffic sent through the server.andM;As soon as OpenMail is available on platforms other than HP-UX, the HPOfficeFax server can be connected as well.andP;  The HP OfficeFax software costs$6,000; both the board and software are available now.andM;PORTABLE NETWARE.andP;  In the first quarter of 1991, NewWave Office will supportNovell's Portable NetWare on both its Unix and MPE servers.andP;  This will allowa Novell PC LAN to plug directly into an HP3000/MPE or HP9000/HP-UX NewWaveOffice server without a bridge.andP;  The advantage here is access to morepowerful servers (especially for large database applications) and portability(using the Novell APIs means support for multiple servers without having nochange the client software).andP;  HP states that there are a number of VARs whowant to write Novell server applications on the Unix platform to accomplishone or both of these objectives.andM;MAC CONNECTION.andP;  Terminal emulation access to NewWave Office for Apple'sMacintosh is already shipping.andP;  Coming by the end of this year will befile-sharing and print-sharing via Pacer for Macs connected to HP Unixservers.andP;  The Pacer software will make the HP-UX server look like anAppleTalk server to the Mac.andM;OS/2 ENHANCEMENTS.andP;  HP has recently committed to implementing networked PCmanagement on its OS/2 server platform.andP;  This was the one missing piece onOS/2 in the original NewWave Office announcement.andP;  NewWave Office for OS/2will now be fully equivalent to NewAve Office for MPE and Unix, with all thesame office services.andP;  The full OS/2 version will be available by mid-1991.andO;Components that will be available earlier on OS/2 include networkobject-sharing (available now through LAN Manager and NewWave on DOS) andInformation Access (targeted for November).andP;  Information Access will workinitially with DOS and OS/2 database products such as dBase and R:base.andM;LAN MANAGER FOR MPE.andP;  HP will implement HP LAN Manager/XL (Named Pipes) onits MPE platform by the end of March 1991.andP;  The benefit here is use of theLAN Manager APIs.andP;  HP intends to rewrite all of its transport code forclient/server applications for Named Pipes, including Information Access andNewWave Mail.andP;  By developing one strategic implementation on Pipes, HPreduces its development effort in deploying the applications on multipleserver platforms.andM;NEW DEVELOPERS.andP;  HP states that 16 additional VARs (for a total of 24) and 18new ISVs (for a total of 119) have now committed to developing NewWaveapplications.andP;  New customer accounts include Spalding Sports, Rich'sDepartment Stores, Hughes Aircraft, and Hercules Incorporated.andM;HP has developed an approach to piloting NewWave in customer accounts thatfocuses on two major steps: identifying a business problem for a group of 20people or less, and developing a set of metrics to measure NewWave's successover a period of three months.andP;  HP then sends a team in to assist in thepilot process.andP;  A major objective is to end up with information that enablesthe customer to cost-justify the implementation of NewWave.andP;  HP is findingthis approach very successful.andM;SUMMARY.andP;  HP is rolling out a comprehensive product line to implement itsNewWave office strategy.andP;  The key advantage here is that fact that enough ofthe products are available today to allow customers to seriously experimentwith solving real business problems.andP;  Although some necessary pieces arestill missing--such as distributed object management, NewWave client softwareon Unix and OS/2, and workgroup applications like calendar/schedulingservices--all are on the docket for future implementation.andP;  And developersupport, while not yet overwhelming, is growing steadily.andP;  All of this pointsto a solid foundation on which HP can continue to build and gain experience.andO;And we all know the value of experience in developing a true understanding ofuser requirements and tailoring products to provide appropriate solutions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
