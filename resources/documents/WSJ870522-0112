Jitters over inflation, Citibank's Third World debt write-off and the dollar spur a new pressure from Wall Street for an early reappointment. While the administration still hasn't decided, supporters of White House economist Beryl Sprinkel -- a contender for the job before Chief of Staff Donald Regan left -- say they have resigned themselves to the likelihood of another Volcker term.    Before the latest turmoil, the Fed chief told an associate that the &quot;odds are very high&quot; that he wouldn't stay after his term expires in August, even if asked, because his wife wouldn't stand for it. But those who know him believe he won't want to leave if the markets are unsettled or if his hard-won gains against inflation are threatened.    He isn't one &quot;to leave in the midst of a crisis,&quot; one friend observes.    CONGRESS WRESTLES with mounting partisanship and a crowded agenda.    Republicans step up efforts to block or slow major Democratic initiatives, especially in the Senate. Coming targets include the Defense authorization bill and public financing of congressional campaigns. In response, Democrats seek to unify their own ranks and devise strategies to make legislation veto-resistant. They will tie any possible tax increase to spending cuts and military spending.    Legislation of all kinds slows. Welfare revision moves to the back burner following House subcommittee Chairman Harold Ford's indictment. Appropriations bills await a budget resolution that is falling behind schedule. But aides predict a rush of action this summer, around the time the debt-ceiling issue comes up again.    WEBSTER INHERITS a troubled CIA and faces tough decisions.    The former FBI director and federal judge takes over an agency shaken by the Iran-Contra scandal and fearful of being hamstrung by congressional demands for more oversight. An early dilemma: whether to keep CIA officials who have been implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal or closely linked to predecessor Casey, or to clean house even at the expense of morale.    Webster's recent praise for Deputy Director Gates, closely associated with the Casey legacy, suggests that he may move more cautiously in making changes than many observers anticipate. Meanwhile, though, investigators study whether top CIA officials encouraged some officers to aid Nicaraguan rebels in defiance of a congressional ban.    A CIA man who had implicated the operations director and other superiors in efforts to help the Contras now has changed his story, investigators say.    VOLUNTARY AIDS TESTS for presidential candidates are favored by 62% of likely voters questioned in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. By an even larger margin -- of better than 2 to 1 -- the respondents also say candidates should voluntarily undergo tests to detect if they have used illicit drugs.    GEPHARDT'S STANCE on trade draws harsh criticism from presidential rival Jesse Jackson. The civil-rights leader describes the Gephardt amendment aimed at exporting nations as demagogic and defeatist, and says it invites retaliation. &quot;You get a big applause,&quot; Jackson says of the Gephardt trade position, &quot;but it's cheap.&quot;    SPECIAL PROSECUTORS looking into the Iran-Contra and Wedtech affairs grapple with turf issues over former Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger, whose activities figure in both investigations. Prosecutors want to prevent overlapping demands for witnesses, documents and grand-jury testimony.    DOLE SCORES a coup for his presidential campaign by signing on former New Hampshire Attorney General Thomas Rath. Rath, who had backed Howard Baker, provides Dole with Baker's list of supporters and contributors and increases the likelihood that New Hampshire's Sen. Rudman will give a vital endorsement to Dole in the first-in-nation presidential primary.    A FARM-CREDIT BAILOUT faces a rough time in Congress.    Lawmakers split over how to proceed. House subcommittee Chairman Ed Jones mulls legislation providing some $6 billion in new lines of credit or guarantees, but Senate Agriculture Chairman Leahy considers that far too high and wants to stretch out any aid so as to limit budget impact.    Most favor steps to protect farmers against foreclosure and provide them some interest-rate relief. But they are divided over other issues -- whether to set up a Chrysler-style bailout board to oversee the rescue effort and whether to create a secondary market for farm loans, dubbed FarmerMac or AggieMae. Legislation isn't likely to pass both houses until the fall.    Both agriculture panels want to move slowly, partly to force credit-system leaders and federal regulators to work out their continuing differences.    MINOR MEMOS: Three Pentagon offices have written contractors asking for information on regulatory duplication. &quot;Triplicate requests to reduce duplication,&quot; sighs an industry lawyer. &quot;Only in the Pentagon.&quot; . . . Addressing a pro-Israel audience, Shultz supports excluding the PLO from Mideast peace talks by bellowing: &quot;PLO? Hell no!&quot; . . . Noting the ambitions of many of her colleagues, Sen. Kassebaum suggests a new bumper sticker for senators: &quot;Honk if you're not running for president.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
