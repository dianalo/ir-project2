<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-0741 </DOCNO><TEXT>Some nuclear-based and non-nuclear analytical techniques have been usedto look for correlations between the results of workplace monitoringand biological parameters of exposed workers in various workplace environments.The analytical competence of the external beam thick and thin targetparticle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) analysis has been establishedfor elemental analysis of air particulates and biological materials.The capability of low-energy photon spectrometry (LEPS) has also beendemonstrated. Using the methods of PIXE and flame AAS, some studies havebeen performed on the elemental composition of air particulates, humanhead hair, nail and urine collected in different workplace environmentsin Dhaka. This report contains a brief account of this research alongwith an outline of future research projects to be carried out in thisand other related areas. 13 refs, 5 figs, 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
