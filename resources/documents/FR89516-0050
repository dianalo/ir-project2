It is indicated that these chargesare predicated on customer nominations of sales entitlements. Natural statesthat there are five basic components of the tariff: (1) The annual nominationof sales services, (2) the procedure and pricing formula for setting Natural'scommodity rate, (3) the determination of the total costs to be recoveredunder the GIDC, (4) the design of the demand charges to recover such costs,(5) the termination of the purchased gas adjustment (PGA), including billingout of the deferred account. Natural also requests pregranted abandonmentof reduced sales service which reflects customer nominations.Natural indicates that the GIDC rates would be recalculated annually andthe sales customers would be provided concurrently an opportunity to nominaterevised levels of sales service. Natural states that in lieu of its PGA,it proposes to implement a market-based procedure for setting its commodityrates. It is indicated that it would post rates for each month prior tothe end of the preceding month, subject to a cap based on a pricing formulaset forth in the application.Natural indicates that the costs of holding supply are essentially proportionalto annual entitlements levels within a certain range. Natural states thatfor the initial period commencing August 1, 1989, the total cost to Naturalof holding supply to meet the current entitlement levels of its customers(613 Bcf annually, with a 2.73 Bcf peak day) is estimated at $272,000,000,which equates to a Monthly Entitlement Demand Rate of 22.20 cents per millionBtu and a Daily Demand Rate of $4.15 per million Btu.Natural indicates that the GIDC consists of two demand charges, the onebased on daily contract quantities and the other based on monthly quantityentitlements.
