The authors synthesized and investigated samples of Kersil,activated by oxides of rare earth elements (Eu, Ce, Sm), as well as simultaneouslywith Eu and Mn in order to increase the light yield of luminescence inthe wavelength range 560-600 nm. The spectral-luminescence propertiesof Kersil can vary over a wide range owing to the purity of the Kersil.</TEXT></DOC>
