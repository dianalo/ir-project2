The study, released Monday by the Office of Commercial SpaceTransportation, said that most commercial rocket launches to orbitmust use one of six launch pads at the Cape Canaveral in Floridaand that the same pads are also in demand by the Department ofDefense and by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.   ``The single most significant potential constraint affecting thecommercial use of government launch ranges is the limited number oflaunch pads available,'' the study said.   Directors of the Eastern Space and Missile Command have made``significant progress'' in adapting to a sharply increased demandfor commercial launch services that followed policy changes afterthe Challenger accident, the report said. But potential commerciallaunch customers, many of whom are foreign companies, are stillconcerned about U.S. companies being able to launch satellites onschedule.   ``Many payload customers have stated that their misgivings about`flying American' are a direct result of past and current U.S.government policies,'' the study found.   The study also noted: ``Payload owners have expressed skepticismabout the ability of U.S. launch firms to meet their needs becauseU. S. launch firms rely on government facilities that are subjectto government policies.'' It said the customers worry that thelaunch range must accommodate U.S. national security needs ``whichwill affect the level of support that can be provided to commerciallaunch operations.''   The 1986 Challenger accident that destroyed a space shuttle andkilled seven astronauts delayed American space launches for morethan two years. President Reagan ordered that commercial payloadswould no longer be launched on the shuttle and laws were passed toencourage establishment of commercial launch services.   There now are at least seven U.S. commercial rocket launchcompanies competing with French, Chinese and Soviet concerns forthe commercial launch business of the world. The French Arianespacecompany now launches about half of all commercial satellites, thestudy said.   In addition to a shortage of launch pads, the Department ofTransportation study also found that policies by the Air Force,which controls the Florida commercial launch pads, are not ``userfriendly,'' a factor that affects the ability of U.S. companies tocompete. The report also said that Air Force safety reviewprocedures are time consuming and could cause delays, and thatshared launch range facilities, such as propellant storage depots,create delays in preparing for commercial launches.</TEXT></DOC>
