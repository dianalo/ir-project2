Various technical optionsof coal liquefaction have been analyzed on the basis of hard coal aswell as lignite - direct liquefaction of coal (hydrogenation) and differentpossibilities of indirect liquefaction, that is the production of fuels(methanol, gasoline) by processing products of coal gasification. TheTA study takes into consideration the entire technology chain from coalmining via coal conversion to the utilization of coal-based fuels inroad transport. The analysis focuses on costs of the various options,overall economic effects, which include effects on employment and publicbudgets, and on environmental consequences compared to the use of liquidfuels derived from oil. Furthermore, requirements of infrastructure andother problems of the introduction of coal-based fuels as well as prospectsfor the export of technologies of direct and indirect coal liquefactionhave been analyzed in the study.</TEXT></DOC>
