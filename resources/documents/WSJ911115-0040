Keating, in closing arguments yesterday, toldjurors that the former chairman of American Continental Corp.must be held accountable for an &quot;oral legacy&quot; ofmisstatements to company bondholders. Mr. Keating facescharges of securities fraud that are based largely on theaggressive sales tactics of his employees.   Summing up 10 weeks of witness testimony in the case,which accuses Mr. Keating of misleading investors about thesafety of American Continental bonds sold at branches of itsformer Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association unit, deputydistrict attorney William Hodgman compared Mr. Keating to anunscrupulous used car dealer.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Let me introduce you to the `lemon law' of California,&quot;Mr. Hodgman said, drawing a parallel to the state securitiesfraud statute that prosecutors claim can be used to convict atop executive for misrepresentations made by hissubordinates. None of the 53 witnesses produced by thegovernment was able to provide a &quot;smoking gun&quot;-evidencedirectly linking the Phoenix, Ariz., businessman to unlawfulsales tactics.   However, some of those who had taken the stand,particularly former Lincoln president Ray C. Fidel, drew apicture of Mr. Keating as a hands-on manager who controlledevery detail of his operation, including the sales pitchesmade by his employees. Mr. Hodgman urged jurors to &quot;draw aninference that the defendant knew bond buyers thought theywere making safe investments&quot; and intended to help misleadthem.   Mr. Fidel has pleaded guilty to six fraud counts and iscooperating with the government. But some of his testimonyapparently buttressed the defense. For example, he said heoften followed instructions of lawyers and accountants indetermining how to market the securities.   Prosecutors have attempted to deflect the jury's attentionfrom the role of the advisers. &quot;I'm not going to assert thatthe defendant, Mr. Keating, is solely responsible for whathappened, for these violations of California law, but he isthe individual who is most responsible,&quot; Mr. Hodgman saidyesterday.   The jurors' view of such statements will probably becrucial to their deliberations, expected to begin as early astoday, after Mr. Keating's lawyer, Stephen C. Neal, completeshis closing arguments.   The outcome of the trial will turn on the prosecution'sevidence alone, because Mr. Neal elected last week, in asurprise move, to rest his case without presenting evidenceto the jury.   &quot;I believe the people have fallen far short of proving thecharges. . . ,&quot; Mr. Neal said when he announced the move. Inaddition to defending the 18 securities fraud charges, Mr.Keating stands at the heart of a massive civil trial relatedto the 1989 failure of Lincoln, and federal criminalindictments are widely expected. Had Mr. Keating chosen totake the stand in his own defense, his testimony might havecomplicated matters in future proceedings.</TEXT></DOC>
