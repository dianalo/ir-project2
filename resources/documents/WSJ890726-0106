In a statement, Hooker said a group of bank lenders terminated an agreement signed earlier this month that called for 42 of Hooker's bank creditors to forgo interest payments and maintain their current level of credit lines to Hooker for four months.    Those banks, whose loans aren't secured by specific assets, are owed about A$900 million (US$674 million). The accord also called for Hooker's biggest lenders to provide additional credit lines to the cash-strapped company.    Separately, people familiar with Hooker's U.S. operations said that First National Bank of Chicago has started foreclosure proceedings on Hooker's 800,000-square-foot Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia, S.C., which is scheduled to be completed this fall. First National Bank of Chicago declined comment. J. Frank Haasbeek, president of L.J. Hooker Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of Hooker, was unavailable for comment.    The collapse of the moratorium appears to damp the chances that B. Altman and Bonwit Teller will receive badly needed fall merchandise. &quot;We haven't shipped B. Altman anything since mid-April, and this isn't going to make it better,&quot; said one New York supplier.    Frank DeRita, senior vice president, Congress Talcott Corp., a major factoring company, said, &quot;Everybody in the factoring industry was looking for cash deposits or for standby letters of credit to be established. It's unfortunate, since these two chains are viable retail businesses.&quot;    Factoring companies buy retail receivables from apparel manufacturers and in many cases act as their credit managers. As such, they exert considerable influence in the market.    One person familiar with the bank negotiations said the talks broke down mainly over Hooker's need to quickly raise short-term funds. As part of the debt moratorium, a group of 10 of Hooker's biggest lenders was expected to ante up an additional A$60 million to A$100 million in credit lines. But the banks demanded that, unlike their other loans, those new lines be secured with Hooker assets.    Hooker asked the banks for an immediate injection of A$55 million, one banker says, but the banks weren't satisfied that Hooker could provide sufficient security for the new loans. Furthermore, the banks became aware that Hooker needed more cash than the creditors had thought.    Hooker officials in Australia refused to comment beyond the terse statement, which also threatened legal action against the banks because they haven't made the additional funds available and are terminating the so-called moratorium on debt repayments.    But bankers close to the situation say Hooker's bank lenders effectively are forcing the company voluntarily to ask the Australian courts to appoint a provisional liquidator as early as today. If the company's directors fail to do so, the banks are likely to ask the courts to appoint one, bankers say. A provisional liquidator can either restructure the company or sell off its assets.    John Tierney, managing director of Bank of Boston's Australian unit, which has unsecured loans to Hooker, said, &quot;Everybody's prospects would have been better&quot; if the bank negotiations hadn't broken down.    Hooker's liabilities totaled A$1.92 billion as of March 31. Of that, Australian and other international banks are owed A$1.6 billion. In addition to the A$900 million in unsecured loans that was covered by the moratorium, Hooker owes an additional A$700 million that is secured against specific Hooker assets, mainly in the U.S.    First National Bank of Chicago, a unit of First Chicago Corp., and Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia are among the largest of the secured lenders, whose loans are less risky than the unsecured credits, bankers say. U.S. banks are owed about A$250 million in unsecured loans, according to Philip Phin, Hooker's chief financial officer.    Hooker shares closed yesterday on the Australian Stock Exchange at 36 Australian cents a share, down six cents from the previous close. Early this year, the shares were trading above A$2 each.    One big shareholder who isn't happy with the latest turn of events is David Marriner, managing director of Fulham Holdings Ltd., a small Australian property investment company. Since early this month, Fulham has built about a 16% stake in Hooker.    Mr. Marriner says he hasn't been able to talk to Hooker's bankers and likewise has been shunned by Hooker's board. &quot;We're sick of standing on the boundary line and not being taken seriously,&quot; he said, adding that Fulham may pursue some &quot;agressive options&quot; in the coming days. </TEXT></DOC>
