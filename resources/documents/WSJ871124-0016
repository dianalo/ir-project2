Main, president and chief operating officer, said.    The contract electronics maker anticipates net of $470,000 to $495,000 for the quarter, or about 17 cents a share, compared with the year-earlier net of $237,615, or seven cents a share.    Sales in the quarter increased about 70% to around $6.5 million from $3.9 million in the year-earlier period, Mr. Main said.    For the fiscal year, IEC expects to report a 49% increase in net to around $1.8 million, or about 65 cents a share. A year earlier, IEC posted net of $1.2 million, or 53 cents a share. In 1987, IEC had about 2.8 million shares outstanding compared with 2.3 million shares outstanding in the previous year. Sales for the year are expected to have increased more than 50% to about $24.2 million from $15.9 million a year earlier.    Mr. Main said he believes the strong showing in the fourth quarter will continue through 1988. &quot;I anticipate a strong 1988 with all quarters gaining,&quot; Mr. Main said.    He said the optimism reflects the continuing strength in the computer and electronics industries, particularly in the personal computer area. Mr. Main said smallbusiness owners, who previously were intimidated by the price and complexities of personal computers, are now buying them. Furthermore, computer makers are incorporating more power into midrange minicomputers, increasing their attractiveness to customers of midsized computers.    Mr. Main said that even if computer buying slows, IEC will benefit from peripheral sales as computer owners buy printers, backup systems and additional disk memory.    At the same time, he said, original equipment makers are turning increasingly to outside companies like IEC to assemble and make electronics parts, such as surface-mounted printed circuit boards and chassis assemblies. Mr. Main said these manufacturers have found that offshore producers can't react as quickly to market changes as domestic producers. </TEXT></DOC>
