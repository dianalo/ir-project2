(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former bingo lobbyist testifiedThursday that he gave $32,000 in cash to Gov. Ned McWherter's 1986campaign and thousands more to state legislators debating changesin the law.   James V. Long, testifying in the federal conspiracy and gamblingtrial of Democratic state Rep. Tommy Burnett and two co-defendants,said he didn't disclose the gifts, as required by state law.   Long, testifying under a plea bargain, was the government'sfirst major witness.   McWherter, who was speaker of the Tennessee House when the giftswere allegedly made, was vacationing in Florida and unavailable tocomment, said spokesman Ken Renner.   Renner said a quick review of the Democratic governor'sfinancial disclosure records showed Long contributed less than$4,000 to McWherter's gubernatorial campaign. However, thespokesman didn't rule out the possibility Long may have concealedsome donations.   Burnett, 47, is charged in a 10-count indictment with illegalgambling, conspiracy, mail fraud and perjury. His co-defendants,Knoxville bingo operator Virginia Hurst and Columbia businessmanE.E. Shutt, are accused of illegal gambling and conspiracy.   Long said the cash gifts ranged from $6,000 to Democratic stateSen. Jim Lewis to $100 to $200 to Democratic Lt. Gov. John Wilder.   Lewis said he received contributions from Long, but said allcame through normal, proper channels.   ``Jim Long said he gave me $6,000? No,'' Lewis said. ``He gaveme $400 at a fund-raiser. I was selling $100 tickets, and he boughtfour.   ``Jim Long did buy my supper occasionally and Jim Long had givenme at one time maybe $500, aside from the $400, at anotherfund-raiser. But that's the most he gave me,'' Lewis said.   Long, who was also named in the indictment, has pleaded guiltyto setting up and running illegal bingo games.   ``I knew the money I was making was illegal. All the money I wasspending was illegal, and I didn't report it,'' said Long. Heclaimed that in 1986 he made $150,000 to $250,000 from bingo.   Long told defense attorney Bob Lynch under cross-examinationhewas just following unwritten ground rules for lobbyists when hegave the legislators cash.   ``I didn't change the rules when I came to Nashville, I justfollowed along,'' he said.   Long was the fourth prosecution witness in the case.   Long pleaded guilty earlier this year in U.S. District Court inNashville and Memphis and in a state court in Memphis for his rolein setting up and operating illegal bingo games.   He testified Thursday that his plea bargain calls for him toreceive no more than five years in prison on each charge, with mostof the sentences to run simultaneously.</TEXT></DOC>
