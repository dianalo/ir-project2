After liberals blocked Mr. Bork's nomination to the courtin 1987, conservatives consoled themselves that Mr. Kennedy,who was easily confirmed to the seat, would be every bit asrightward-leaning.</LP><TEXT>   It hasn't quite worked out that way. While themild-mannered former federal appellate judge castsconservative votes on most issues and has helped push thecourt to the right on abortion and the death penalty, he isalso emerging as the court's leading proponent of free speechand the press. At times he displays flashes of concern aboutpolice searches and the rights of criminal defendants.   One Kennedy opinion last year upholding suspects'protection against self-incrimination, says Prof. YaleKamisar of the University of Michigan Law School, &quot;soundedjust like William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall,&quot; who untiltheir recent retirements were the court's strongest liberalvoices. Justice Kennedy interpreted Miranda vs. Arizona, the1966 decision requiring police to advise suspects of theirrights, &quot;more expansively than the Warren court read ititself,&quot; adds Prof. Kamisar, a prominent liberal scholar.   Some conservatives express disappointment with JusticeKennedy. &quot;What you think you see is not always what you'llget,&quot; says Thomas Jipping, a legal analyst with the FreeCongress Foundation. Justice Kennedy is turning out to be aless &quot;ideological type of justice&quot; than Mr. Bork would havebeen, and &quot;doesn't sift every case through a set of(conservative) principles,&quot; Mr. Jipping complains.   Conservatives' worst nightmare is that Mr. Kennedy mighteventually slip out of the conservative fold entirely.Indeed, Robert Giuffra, a New York lawyer who clerked forChief Justice William Rehnquist in the 1988-89 term, suggeststhe aberrations in the justice's voting record &quot;mightforeshadow a leftward shift&quot; in his overall philosophy. Otherformer clerks call it the &quot;Blackmun syndrome,&quot; a reference toJustice Harry Blackmun's evolution from a follower of formerChief Justice Warren Burger to an independent thinker who isnow on the left of the court's political spectrum.   Jane Kirtley, director of the Washington-based ReportersCommittee for Freedom of the Press, asserts that JusticeKennedy &quot;is more solid on our issues&quot; than anyone else on thecourt. Last June, he led the majority in the Masson vs. NewYorker libel case, which went against the magazine butincluded ample sympathy for press shortcomings. Given thatthe dispute involved allegedly deliberate misquotation anddefamation, Justice Kennedy's opinion &quot;was much better thanwe had a right to expect,&quot; says Ms. Kirtley.   Mr. Bork, based on his writings and judicial record, mightalso have defended the press in some cases. But JusticeKennedy has carried the First Amendment banner into astartling variety of areas. In December, he wrote a powerfulconcurrence in the court's decision striking down New York's&quot;Son of Sam&quot; law, under which the state confiscatedcriminals' profits from books or movies describing theirmisdeeds. He accused Justice Sandra O'Connor, in essence, ofnot going nearly far enough in her majority opinion. TheKennedy view, that &quot;the New York statute amounts to rawcensorship,&quot; would sweep away all laws targeting criminalauthors' income; the O'Connor opinion left that issue open.   In 1989 and 1990, Justice Kennedy concurred with thearguments of anti-government protesters when he joined 5-4majorities striking down laws that banned flagburning.   Stern about death-row appeals, he nevertheless broke fromthe other two Reagan appointees, Justices O'Connor andAntonin Scalia, and voted in a 1990 case to invalidate NorthCarolina's capital sentencing statute. The reason: Itrequired jurors to vote unanimously to find mitigatingcircumstances weighing against execution. Just last year,Justice Kennedy also cast the deciding vote in a 5-4 rulingthat a convicted Idaho killer's constitutional rights hadbeen violated because a judge sentenced him to death afterprosecutors indicated they wouldn't seek execution.   Justice Kennedy has written several opinions declaringthat almost any type of official racial preference, includinggovernment-sponsored affirmative action, violates theconstitutional guarantee of &quot;equal protection.&quot; But hesurprised legal scholars last year with his opinion in a caseinvolving whether a private party in a civil case could seekto exclude prospective black jurors.   Before trial, litigants generally may ask that potentialjurors be removed for specific reasons, such as a conflict ofinterest. Exercising so-called peremptory challenges, eachside may also strike a certain number of jurors withouthaving to give an explanation.   As government officials, prosecutors are barred incriminal cases from using peremptory challenges to remove allblack jurors. Justice Kennedy, writing for a six-personmajority, said private litigants are also prohibited frompicking juries based on race alone. His opinion turned onabstruse constitutional doctrine, but the theme was thatgovernment, and especially the judicial system, may nottolerate racial bias. Justice Kennedy also wrote the majorityopinion in a separate case last year, in which the courtruled that a criminal defendant of any race may challenge theexclusion of black jurors.</TEXT></DOC>
