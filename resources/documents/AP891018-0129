Other nations in the 49-member grouping of Britain and itsformer colonies, including Canada and host Malaysia, pressed forcontinued or stronger embargoes. Proponents said sanctions forcedPresident F.W. de Klerk to promise reforms and release blacknationalist leaders.   The exchanges on the weeklong summit's opening day heralded anew confrontation over South Africa, which quit the Commonwealth in1961.   ``We are much more likely to achieve our aim by givingencouragement than by trying to behave as if nothing significanthas happened,'' Mrs. Thatcher told a closed session of the summit.Her comments were reported by a British official, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   He quoted her as saying de Klerk took a ``major step forward''by releasing eight black leaders this week, allowing peacefuldemonstrations and being prepared to consult ``all shades ofopinion.''   Britain, a major trading partner of South Africa, argues thatsanctions hurt blacks and increase white resistance to change.   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia said sanctions``must not only continue but must be escalated'' to force an end toapartheid, the official policy of racial segregation that allowsSouth Africa's 5 million whites to maintain control over 28 millionblacks.   ``Sanctions work,'' Mahathir declared. ``Concern for the effectof sanctions on the blacks is misplaced. ... Investments andfinancial flows to racist South Africa must be completely stopped.''   In a blunt opening address, he also blamed industrializedcountries for pollution and accused them of ``manipulating'' theworld economy.   ``It is the developed countries which have most assailed ourenvironment,'' he said. ``Nuclear testing, excessive use of fossilfuels, private transportation, release of CFC into the atmosphere,massive wastage of paper, toxic chemical disposal _ all these andmore are the direct result of the lifestyle of the rich.''   Mahathir said rich nations have ``ganged up against the poor.They have arrogated to themselves the right to direct world tradeand to manipulate currencies to their advantage.''   Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, titular head of the Commonwealth,acknowledged Wednesday night that the organization has ``familydisagreements.''   ``Like all the best families, we have our share ofeccentricities, of impetuous and wayward youngsters and ofdisagreements,'' she told the heads of government at a banquet onthe royal yacht Britannia, but added: ``You have shown that it ispossible to make advances even on the most difficult problems.''   Canada wants the Commonwealth to maintain current embargoes onSouth Africa and oppose rescheduling of the foreign debt. But italso supports holding off on any new punitive measures for sixmonths to give de Klerk an opportunity for reform.   Debate on the issue was scheduled for Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
