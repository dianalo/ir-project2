Judge Patrick Morse upheld the right of two Chicago prostitutesto refuse to submit to the test, ruling that the law amounted tounwarranted search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendmentof the U.S. Constitution.   The women had pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation ofprostitution.   The law, approved by the Illinois General Assembly in 1987, tookeffect last year. , was one of a number passed by state lawmakersin recent years to deal with the spread of acquired immunedeficiency syndrome.   Al Tomaso, who prosecuted the case, said no decision had beenmade on whether to appeal the decision, but defense attorneys inthe case said he had advised them there would be an appeal.   State Rep. Ralph C. Capparelli, one of the sponsors of thelegislation, said he found it difficult to understand why the judgewould not allow mandatory testing of prostitutes.   ``Prostitutes are out there making business and they pass thedisease,'' he said. ``It's just one way of trying to control thedisease.''   The American Civil Liberties Union called medical experts whotestified the law would not prevent the spread of AIDS.   ``When someone listens to what an expert evaluation really is offorced testing, then it's quite clear that kind of approach isalmost never useful,'' said ACLU attorney John Hammell.   ``Women in prostitution don't want to die from AIDS, either.Condom use among prostitutes is extremely high.''   Fred Wellisch, an assistant Cook County public defender who alsoworked on the case, said the state law was weak in that there wasno reasonable basis to suspect the prostitutes had AIDS.   ``It was just the fact these people fell into aclassification,'' he said.   Under the law, a judge must order the AIDS test if a person wasconvicted of any of 13 sex-related offenses. The judge had thediscretion to release the results if deemed in the public interest.   Thursday's ruling comes as Gov. James R. Thompson is consideringwhether to sign legislation repealing a 1988 law that requirescouples to be tested for AIDS before being issued a marriagelicense.   A spokeswoman for the governor said Thompson had no immediatecomment on the judge's decision.</TEXT></DOC>
