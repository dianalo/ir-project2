(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Lazarev, Gregory L.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Developing software using the Smalltalk object-orientedprogramming language is different from using the standardwrite-from-scratch approach of conventional software development.andO;Existing code is 'shaped' for specific needs, which makesreusability of utmost importance.andP;  Reusability is based on theobject-oriented programming concepts of encapsulation, dynamicbinding, inheritance and others, as well as on the existence of anelaborate class hierarchy.andP;  Reusability in Smalltalk is examinedusing the prototype of the MeltingFurnace system as an example.andO;Among the other unique Smalltalk features discussed are windowinterfaces using the model-pane-dispatcher (MPD) paradigm, activevalues and dynamic compiling.andP;  The case study described is acomputer monitoring system for a steel foundry; it was developedusing Digitalk's Smalltalk/V 286 in only ten days.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Product:   Smalltalk/V 286 (Program development software) (Usage).andO;Topic:     Object-Oriented ProgrammingCase StudyProgram Development TechniquesSmalltalkApplicationsProgramming InstructionComputer-Aided ManufacturingControl SystemsFactory ManagementObject-Oriented Languages.andO;Feature:   illustrationprogram.andO;Caption:   Selected methods of the class MeltingFurnaceTop.
