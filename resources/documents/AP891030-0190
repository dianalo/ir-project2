Baker IIIexpressed concern Monday that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortegamay try to use alleged attacks by the Nicaraguan Contras as anexcuse to scuttle elections set for next February.   ``I worry that they (the Sandinistas) may be trying to lay apredicate to walk away from their commitment to hold elections,''Baker said in an interview with The Associated Press.   However, Ortega on Monday said that the elections would be heldas planned, regardless of the resolution of the dispute over theContras.   ``The elections are taking place in Nicaragua, period,'' Ortegasaid, speaking through an interpreter in an interview with NBCNews. ``With Contra or without Contra they are going to take place,definitely. With war or no war, that is, elections are takingplace.''   Ortega has said that, under certain conditions, he may not renewa cease-fire that the Sandinistas and the Contras agreed to inMarch 1988. Ortega has contended that the rebels havesystematically violated the agreement.   Baker said Ortega may be worried that opposition candidateVioleta Chamorro could have a ``real chance of winning if theelections are halfway free and fair.''   ``If there is a chance for democracy to win an election, maybethe approach hasn't been all wrong,'' Baker said, answeringskeptics who contend the administration has not applied enoughpressure on Nicaragua.   The administration was ``waiting and watching'' to see if Ortegawill call off a 19-month truce with U.S.-backed rebels.   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Ortega was atarget of mounting pressure from his Latin American neighbors notto follow through on his threat.   ``The issue pretty much goes back to President Ortega and theSandinistas in the sense of he's changed his position a littlebit,'' Fitzwater said. ``We, obviously, are urging that thecease-fire be maintained.''   After startling a hemispheric conference on democracy in CostaRica by announcing Friday that he would cancel the cease-fire,Ortega modified his position to say he would decide the matterTuesday.   A senior State Department official, briefing reporters on thecondition of anonymity, agreed with Baker that a decision by Ortegato abrogate the cease-fire would be merely ``a pretext to end theelection process.'' Recent polls show Ortega to be trailing theU.S.-backed presidential candidate, Violeta Chamorro, incampaigning for next February's elections.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., called Ortega's threat``regrettable. I hope it will be reconsidered.''   ``By all reports, both Nicaragua and Ortega are suffering...(because of) a blunder on his part,'' Foley said.   For his part, Bush said at least four Latin American presidentshad chastised Ortega and that Costa Rican President Oscar Arias,who won a Nobel Prize for his efforts to bring peace to the region,was ``furious.''   Chatting with several reporters he invited for a mid-day jog,Bush said he had been misunderstood in calling Ortega a little man,and that he had meant to say small-minded. He conceded that theNicaraguan leader, who is five-foot-ten, is not small of stature.   Bush said he would not speculate on whether he might seekrenewed military aid for the Contras if Ortega carries through onhis threat.   His spokesman, Fitzwater, said: ``Our purpose is still to get afree and fair election and to pursue the peace process.''   Administration officials privately said a request for militaryaid was extremely unlikely _ given strong bipartisan congressionalopposition to rearming the Contras.   Under an agreement reached last spring between the White Houseand Congress, humanitarian aid is to be continued to the Contrasthrough the Feb. 25 elections in Nicaragua.   Congressional leaders have vowed to adhere to that agreement _which also envisions the disbanding of the rebel group once freeand fair elections have been assured.   ``We have an agreement with the administration,'' Foley said onMonday.   With Ortega to announce on Tuesday whether he will continue thecease-fire, ``it's pretty much a case of waiting and watching tosee what he does and to make sure that our views are clear,''Fitzwater said.   He also said U.S. officials ``do not buy for one minute''Ortega's rationale for threatening to end the truce _ violations ofthe cease-fire by the Contras.   Fitzwater said that Sandinista violations, including breaking atreaty banning shipping arms to leftist rebels in El Salvador,``dwarf any violations by the Contras.''   The State Department official said that ``Latin leaders wereshocked and disappointed'' by Ortega's behavior at the Costa Rica.   ``I would note that this (Contras) is an army withoutammunition, by and large. They have not received any U.S. militarysupplies since February 1988, while the Sandinista is awell-equipped, well-supplied military force,'' the officialsaid.``So, the idea that the resistance would routinely attack theSandinista army is an unlikely event.''</TEXT></DOC>
