<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-1414 </DOCNO><TEXT>Presents an in-depth study of geological conditions and problems arisingwith plans for the extension of surface mining towards the foot of thecrytalline Ore Mountains in North Bohemia (Czechoslovakia). Geologicalmaps of the region are presented. Recommended actions as part of preparatorywork include more detailed studies of all geological aspects of the basinand adjoining mountains, including recent tectonic changes caused byapproaching mining activities. Furthermore, preparation of regional forecastsof tectonic deformations, widening on-going research into vertical componentsof recent tectonic movements, and an expansion of the network of seismicstations are recommended. Postponing mining of the technically most difficultseams is recommended until more experience is gained. 79 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
