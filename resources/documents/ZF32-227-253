(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Mountain Network Solutions Inc.andM;FILESAFE 1200andM;The physical installation of a FileSafe 1200 drive is virtually child's play.andO;Mountain's SCSI controller has a set of jumpers for IRQ, DMA channel and I/Oport number, with a wide range of choices to minimize possible conflicts withother cards.andP;  Several FileSafe 1200 drives can be daisy-chained together onthe same SCSI controller.andM;A DAT cartridge is inserted into a vertical opening in the front of theFileSafe 1200, and an LED on the front displays the physical operation inprogress: rewind, search, read or write.andM;The only glitch in the otherwise smooth software installation process is thatit must be run from the A drive, using either a 1.2M-byte 5-1/4-inch disk ora 720K-byte 3-1/2-inch disk.andP;  PC Week Labs successfully installed it from theB drive by first editing the batch-file installation procedure.andM;The Mountain FileSafe 1200 does not require the installation of DOS devicedrivers.andP;  Mountain provides two sets of software that run under DOS or insidean OS/2 DOS compatibility box.andP;  FileSafe is for backup of workstations, andFileTalk is for peer-to-peer backups across a network.andP;  FileTalk requireseither NetBIOS or Novell IPX, and is the only software reviewed that supportsboth for peer-to-peer backups.andP;  FileTalk invokes the FileSafe commands toperform backup and restore operations.andM;FileSafe displays and refreshes the estimated percentage complete, totalnumber of files to process and number of files to process while it isrunning.andP;  The FileSafe Tape command has no on-line help, but it does includea reference card that explains all command-line parameters.andM;FileTalk uses the Lambda Group's PIPES software to communicate between the PCwith the DAT drive and other workstations.andM;FileTalk installs as a TSR program on the workstation, occupying nearly 40Kbytes.andM;In PC Week Labs' tests, the FileTalk/PIPES mechanism performed slower thanFileSafe on a server drive, but it was far more flexible.andP;  A backup andrestore of 21M bytes of data on a server partition took a little more than 26minutes with FileTalk.andP;  FileSafe needed just six and a half minutes toperform the corresponding operations.andM;A pair of programs, AutoSet and AutoRun, manage unattended backup operations.andO;AutoSet is a menu-driven program for preparation of a backup schedule, whichincludes days of the week and time to initiate a backup, and the DOS commandor batch file to be run at that time for each backup event.andM;During PC Week Labs' setup, AutoRun displayed error messages that are notdocumented in the FileSafe manual.andP;  Once installed and operational, however,AutoRun managed unattended backups properly.andM;For command-line backups, FileSafe generates a concise exception report inASCII text format on a file.andP;  This report lists those files that were nothandled error-free and explains the cause of the exception.andM;------------------&quot;VITAL SIGNS&quot; DATAandM;Mountain Network Solutions Inc.andM;Campbell, Calif.andM;(800) 458-0300 or (408) 379-4300andM;Privately heldandM;Year established: 1977andM;Number of employees: 400andM;Gross annual revenue: Not disclosedandM;Gross annual earnings: Not disclosedandM;Source: Computer Directory on CompuServeandM;</TEXT></DOC>
