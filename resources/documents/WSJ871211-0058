But most of the over-the-counter issues hardest hit by such sellers are too small to have had much impact on the OTC indexes.    Adding to the confusion, some speculators -- attempting to catch the shrunken stocks exactly at their lowest price -- were pouncing on shares of depressed issues as tax-motivated sellers unloaded them. The result was a pricing hodgepodge with some of the most damaged stocks showing sizable gains yesterday, while others collapsed further.    If individuals sell stocks by the end of the year, they can write off their losses from the sales for tax purposes against a portion of their salaries and against investment gains from other sources.    The tax-motivated selling and speculating added to volume that had to be handled by the National Association of Securities Dealers automated quotations system yesterday, but the NASD computers handled the 150 million shares with relative ease. On Wednesday the Nasdaq computer system had shut down much of the day in a power outage.    A majority of the most-withered issues traded in heavy volume yesterday are listed on the National Market System, where before the crash many were priced at $10 a share and more. National Market System volume yesterday was 117 million shares, a record for post-crash trading.    The Nasdaq Composite Index edged down fractionally yesterday to 300.81, a 0.4% decline. The National Market System industrials were relatively flat at 116.43, a decline of only 0.1%. Thus neither market reflected the last-minute dip in prices that sent the Dow Jones Industrials down.    Analysts say the stocks most vulnerable to year-end tax-motivated selling by individuals this year are those that plunged farthest in the October crash and since then.    The giant stocks that institutions trade on Nasdaq are not particularly vulnerable to such tax selling because most of their holders are institutions. Furthermore, few of the largest OTC issues have declined much in price.    Among the giant issues that have tumbled more than 50% since their pre-crash highs, Intel yesterday fell 1 1/2 to 24; Liz Claiborne was off 1/4 to 13 1/4, Charming Shoppes fell 1/2 to 10 1/4, and First Executive Life was off 1/4 to 8 1/8. Food Lion Class B rose 1/4 to 11.    Some smaller stocks that had their gains pared by more than half in the crash and since include Enviropact, at 23 1/4 at the end of September, which yesterday fell 4 1/4 to 7 3/8. The company also blamed margin selling by its own former stockholders for part of the drop in its price. Comp-U-Check, a software stock, closed yesterday at 2, down 1 3/8. It has tumbled from 6 3/4 in September. Electronic Telecom Class A fell 1 1/4 to 2 1/2 yesterday. It started the year at 9 1/2. Miltope Group, a computer hardware issue, started the year at 16. Yesterday it fell 1 1/4 to 5.    Nellcor slid 1 3/8 yesterday to 9 1/2. It was at 19 1/4 just before the crash. Price Pfister, which makes water faucets, fell 1 to 6 1/2. It began the year at 18.    Meanwhile, some issues that have been repeatedly hit in recent weeks suddenly rebounded on relatively heavy volume yesterday. Antonovich, the furrier, down 78% for the year, yesterday rose 3/4 to 2 3/8. J. Bildner andamp; Son, the fancy grocer that has plunged from 11 1/4 earlier in the year, yesterday rose 1/2 to 2 1/4. </TEXT></DOC>
