The executions prompted threats of massacres by Sikh militants.Heavily-armed police and paramilitary units were on alert in thecapital, as well as in Punjab and neighboring states of HimachalPradesh and Haryana.   Scattered violence was reported in New Delhi and Punjab.   Satwant Singh, Mrs. Gandhi's bodyguard, and Kehar Singh werepronounced dead less than a half-hour after they were taken fromtheir tiny cells on death row and marched to the rain-soaked gallowsat New Delhi's Tihar Jail, a police official said.   According to a Home Ministry official, Kehar Singh proclaimed hisinnocence and Satwant Singh said he had no regrets. As the nooseswere tied around their necks, they shouted the Sikh warrior call,``Say the faithful, God is great!'' said the official, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   The executions capped four years of legal maneuvering that beganafter Mrs. Gandhi was gunned down Oct. 31, 1984, apparently inrevenge for an army raid she ordered on the Golden Temple, theholiest Sikh shrine.   The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected appeals by both men.   Satwant Singh was one of the two policemen who opened fire onMrs. Gandhi in the garden of her official residence. The other,Beant Singh, was shot to death minutes later by Gandhi's bodyguards.   Kehar Singh, Beant Singh's uncle, was convicted of helping plotthe assassination.   Satwant Singh, 30, and Kehar Singh, a 54-year-old formergovernment clerk, are not related. Like all members of the Sikhreligion, they take the Singh name, which means lion in Punjabilanguage.   Shortly before 8 a.m., the men were taken from their 8-by-8 footprison cells. With their hands tied behind their backs and theirlegs bound with iron chains, they were escorted by guards to thescaffold in the open courtyard, 25 steps away.   Caps were put on their heads and inch-thick ropes placed aroundtheir necks. Two hangmen then pulled the bolts that released thetrapdoors.   Relatives of Kehar Singh, including his son Rajinder and wifeJabsir, wept at a police barricade about a half-mile from the jail.   Police said no civilian was allowed to witness the execution.   Satwant Singh and Kehar Singh spent their final hours visitingrelatives and lawyers.   Satwant Singh's lawyer, R.S. Sodhi, described his client as``very, very composed'' and read a handwritten statement from him.   ``There is no greater privilege for a Sikh to lay down his lifefor the protection'' of the Sikh faith, the statement said. ``I wishI could be born again and again and each time lay down my life forthis.''   The bodies of the men were cremated, a Home Ministry officialsaid. Prison officials said the ashes would not be turned over torelatives for fear of violence.   In the northern city of Amritsar, wall posters threatened masskillings of Hindus. The head priest of the Sikh religion, DarshanSingh Ragi, told 300 people at a special prayer service that the men``did the right thing in killing Mrs. Gandhi.''   Police in New Delhi reported the stoning of buses near theprison. In Punjab, suspected Sikh extremists set fire to a bus inthe village of Vaunver, and security forces defused two bombs hiddenin the center of the town of Ludihana, police said. There were noreports of casualties.   Both men were convicted in 1986 and sentenced to death. Theconvictions and sentences were later upheld by the Delhi High Courtand the Supreme Court.   Another Sikh, Balbir Singh, also was convicted of conspiracy andsentenced to death. The Supreme Court, however, acquitted him forlack of evidence.   Four months before her assassination, Mrs. Gandhi ordered an armyraid on the Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh shrine. The temple wasbeing used as a armed base by militant Sikhs.   More than 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, died in the radi.   Gandhi's assassination caused anti-Sikh riots in northern Indiaby members of the Hindu majority. More than 2,700 people werekilled, nearly all of them Sikhs.   Sikh violence has increased since, and at least 2,440 people werekilled last year in Punjab, the only Indian state in which Sikhs arethe majority.   Sikh militants have fought since 1982 for a separate nation inPunjab. They claim discrimination by Hindus, who make up more than80 percent of India's 880 million people.</TEXT></DOC>
