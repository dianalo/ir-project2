Mr. Weil, 62 years old, has been Phibro's chief since1986; he will leave at year end. Though Mr. Weil denies hewas pushed, his retirement comes as Salomon's interim chiefWarren Buffett is forcing out some of Salomon's highly paidveteran executives. Mr. Weil, who helped build Phibro into aglobal oil trading force, has received a total of $13 millionin salary and bonus in the past two years, according toSalomon's proxy statement.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Weil will be succeeded by Andrew J. Hall, Phibro's41-year-old president and one of the most powerful oiltraders of the past decade. Mr. Hall's star has been risingat Salomon recently; he made about $20 million in salary andbonus last year and was named to the Salomon board inFebruary. Mr. Hall, who will remain Phibro president, alreadysets strategy for Phibro's global operations.   Phibro is one of the two major units of Salomon Inc.Salomon's investment banking arm, Salomon Brothers Inc., hasbeen embroiled in a Treasury-auction bidding scandal sinceAugust. Phibro Corp. had acquired Salomon Brothers in 1981,but was absorbed into Salomon Inc. after a subsequent powerstruggle.   In an interview, Mr. Weil said he had originally plannedto step down next year, but his decision to retire now &quot;hadabsolutely zero to do with&quot; Mr. Buffett's sweeping cutbacksat Salomon. Rather, he said, he recently realized that &quot;it'stime to step down&quot; after he had grown tired of the endlesstrips between Phibro's U.S. and Swiss offices; there were 16such trips this year alone, he said. Mr. Weil, who willcontinue to be a member of the Salomon Inc. board, said heplans to study law.   The retirement of the bearlike Mr. Weil comes at aturbulent time for Phibro, which is also the nation'sthird-largest independent refiner with 330,000 barrels ofdaily capacity. Phibro's earnings have nose-dived after arecord 1990 as a result of difficult oil-trading markets andtight refining margins.   In 1991's first nine months, Phibro had net income of $35million, down sharply from the $366 million a year earlier.Last year, Phibro earned more pretax profit than the firm'sflagship Salomon Brothers unit.   This year's profit pinch started early. In January, Phibrohad a loss of about $40 million amid a record one-dayoil-price plunge of more than $10-a-barrel at the start ofthe Persian Gulf war. Phibro then slashed about 10% of itsstaff in a restructuring program. It currently is innegotations to sell a 20% equity stake in its U.S. operationsto the Nigerian state oil company.   Nonetheless, Phibro is expected to wield more weightaround the Salomon empire under Mr. Buffett. In a recentnewspaper advertisement announcing Salomon's earnings, Mr.Buffett went out of his way to praise Phibro's efforts,despite its recent profit plunge. But Mr. Buffett also hasgone on record as saying that Salomon's highly paid stafferswill have to earn their compensation. Overall, 1991 bonuseswill be way down at Salomon when they are doled out in thenext few weeks; in October, Mr. Buffett took back $110million the firm had earlier earmarked for bonuses.   That ensures that, despite his promotion, Mr. Hall,Phibro's new chief, isn't likely to earn anywhere near the$20 million he got in 1990.   The poker-faced Mr. Hall has long been one of the mostaggressive &quot;long&quot; players in the oil markets; that is, heprefers owning physical barrels of oil or oil futures on abet that prices will rise. Although he hedges, the bets areoften huge, backed by Phibro's $1.18 billion in stockholderequity. Mr. Hall's bullish stance paid off handsomely lastyear amid the explosive rise in oil prices following Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait. This year, however, the price ofbellwether West Texas Intermediate crude oil has plunged 28%.   Mr. Hall joined Phibro in 1982 as a crude-oil trader andbecame executive vice president and a Phibro board member in1985. He earlier had worked for nine years at BritishPetroleum, where he held various positions in trading andsupply. He holds a master's degree in chemistry from OxfordUniversity.   In an interview, Mr. Hall downplayed his most recentpromotion. For the past couple of years, he has handled muchof Phibro's day-to-day operations while being groomed for thetop spot. Even with &quot;the impressive change in titles, I don'tsee any major changes resulting from it,&quot; Mr. Hall saidyesterday.   Despite his praise of Phibro, Mr. Buffett has angered theenergy unit's executives with his pledge to reject deals orclients that he deems to be too &quot;close to the line.&quot; InSeptember, Phibro executives were stunned when Mr. Buffettordered them to sever all ties with Marc Rich andamp; Co., one ofPhibro's biggest clients; Mr. Rich has been a fugitive fromthe U.S. since 1983 over tax charges.   Mr. Weil has been a Salomon executive vice president andmember of its board since 1987. He has worked at Phibro orits predecessor firms for 16 years; he served as chairman andpresident of Phibro Energy AG, where he was responsible forthe firm's non-U.S. crude oil and refined products tradingactivities. He joined Philipp Brothers AG as a managingdirector in 1975 after being in the textile business for theprevious 24 years.   &quot;I took over {the energy operation}, which was in itsinfancy, and made a very strong company out of it, and I'mvery proud of that,&quot; he said yesterday. Although he concededhe would have liked to step down amid stronger earnings, hesaid profit slumps are &quot;going to happen in a tradingcompany.&quot; But Mr. Weil added: &quot;We have never lost money.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
