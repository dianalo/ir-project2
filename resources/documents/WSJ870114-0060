In a two-hour interview last night, Tariq Aziz, foreign minister and second deputy prime minister, said, &quot;I don't think after this battle they will be in a position to make new attacks of any size. There will be exhaustion among them.&quot;    The foreign minister's remarks came at the end of a day of fierce fighting -- by both Iraqi and Iranian accounts -- on the ground near the strategic city of Basra and in the air, with both sides attacking each other's cities. A ground-to-ground missile fell on Baghdad early yesterday morning, reportedly killing a small number of civilians; in retaliation, Iraq bombed several Iranian cities, including Kermanshah, an Iranian training camp and air base.    According to Western and Iraqi sources, despite heavy losses, Iran continues to pour thousands more men into a tiny four-square-mile area surrounded on three sides by Iraqi troops and pounded relentlessly by Iraqi artillery. While Western sources expressed puzzlement at Iran's seemingly suicidal tactics, Mr. Aziz explained events this way: &quot;This is the final offensive begun in December that Iran has been threatening for over a year. If the Iranians lose this battle totally, it would be a very dramatic failure. So they would like to retain some territory to say that they have achieved something.&quot;    For the most part, Western sources agree with Mr. Aziz that Iranian casualties from this battle are likely to be so heavy that Iran will have to at least pause for a time before launching further attacks. Iraqi officials insist Iranian losses in this battle are greater than in the December fighting, which Pentagon officials estimated cost at least 15,000 Iranian lives. But Iraqi losses will be heavy, too. Iran reported yesterday that its forces again overran Iraqi troops in some locations.    Mr. Aziz, a former English teacher, is adept at delivering straight talk with diplomatic smiles that soften the harshness of his words. But even this silver-haired, cigar-smoking diplomat used tough words to describe America's arms sales to Iran. Mr. Aziz, who was Iraq's link to the U.S., is especially sensitive about the American deception over Iran. &quot;We felt this was an act of aggression,&quot; he said, &quot;without any moral or political justification.&quot; He said the sales had had a major psychological impact on Iran, and a negative military impact on Iraq.    The foreign minister charged that the U.S. decision to sell Iran antiaircraft and antitank missiles was a deliberate attempt to neutralize Iraq's clear superiority in aircraft and tanks. Iraq has admitted losing five planes in its bombing raids this past week.    &quot;It's already clear that the antiaircraft missiles have had an impact,&quot; he said. &quot;They got fresh equipment from you and that's why they are succeeding more.&quot; He said once the present fighting ends, Iraq will be able to determine if Iran has used American-made TOW antitank missiles to good effect.    The foreign minister also charged that the U.S. arms sales to Iran were responsible for Iran's determination to try to conquer Basra, Iraq's southern port, and an oil-rich region of Iraq on the border with Kuwait. Without Basra, Iraq would no longer be a Persian Gulf state. He said that before the U.S. arms sales, Iran had feared that any move on Basra would be seen by the U.S. as threatening to its interests in the Persian Gulf, particularly Saudi Arabia. &quot;But the U.S. removed the fear it would react to protect its interests in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia when it began selling arms,&quot; he said.    Mr. Aziz said American deception of its friends in the Middle East had destroyed U.S. credibility and created destabilizing uncertainties in the entire region.    &quot;The credibility of the U.S. has been damaged seriously in the whole region,&quot; he said. &quot;If a country relying on the U.S. feels it can be damaged, how can it feel safe with relations with the U.S.?&quot;    Asked what the consequences of a loss of U.S. credibility might be, Mr. Aziz said, &quot;It will weaken countries in the face of Iranian expansionism, in the face of terrorist blackmail, in the face of radical religious movements.&quot;    Mr. Aziz said Iraq had long been suspicious of U.S. intentions for several reasons. First, he said, Iraq had urged that if the U.S. opposed continuation of the war that President Reagan discuss that view with other Western leaders and with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. But he said Secretary of State George Shultz always demurred.    Furthermore, he said, when Iranian threats against Saudi Arabia and Kuwait increased, the U.S. urged the two Gulf states to grant America military facilities there rather than suggesting those states strengthen their ties with Iraq.    And, he said, the U.S. last year began planting doubts in Saudi and Kuwaiti minds about the Iraqi morale and ability to continue the war. &quot;If all this had been an intelligence operation,&quot; he said, &quot;I wouldn't have been surprised. &quot;What made it a very deep and dramatic surprise was that it was a presidential policy.&quot;    Mr. Aziz sought to downplay reports that the U.S. deliberately misled Iraq's army with faulty intelligence last year before an Iranian victory at Fao. &quot;There was a clear misinformation campaign,&quot; he said. &quot;But we never relied on the U.S. for our military intelligence.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
