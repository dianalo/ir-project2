Nomani   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/27/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><CO>   U</CO><IN>AIRLINES (AIR)</IN><LP>   ARLINGTON, Va. -- USAir Group Inc. said it would dismissby year end another 2,100 employees, many of them managers,in the deepest cut yet of its payroll and one of the largestlayoffs by an airline in years.   The action brings to 3,600 people the number of employeesthat USAir has fired or furloughed in recent days. Theairline holding company blamed the layoffs, which affect 7%of its 54,000 employees, on &quot;softening of passenger demand,poor economic conditions, escalating fuel costs and thecompany's need to reduce operating expenses.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The cuts also amount to a mid-course correction ofambitious expansion plans at USAir. USAir said it slashed its1991 projected capacity growth rate to a maximum of 2% from6%.   The layoffs at the nation's No. 6 air carrier are muchdeeper than Wall Street analysts expected and are sure tosend a chill through the airline industry. Most of theindustry's massive personnel cuts in recent years have comeat financially troubled carriers such as Continental Airlinesand Eastern Airlines, both units of Continental AirlinesHolding Inc. But USAir has traditionally been one of thecountry's most profitable carriers.   To be sure, USAir has been posting losses since itcompleted its merger with Piedmont Aviation Inc. last August.In the first half of 1990, USAir has piled up net losses of$113 million.   &quot;The cushion is gone, and they're facing a difficult,uncertain future,&quot; said Edmund Greenslet, an airlineconsultant at ESG Aviation Services. &quot;They can't sit aroundand wait.&quot;   Already, other airlines have been hunkering down inexpectation of waning demand resulting from a recession.Midway Airlines, a small Chicago-based carrier, startedlaying off some employees in May. AMR Corp.'s AmericanAirlines Chairman Robert Crandall has issued an edict to cutcosts in his company.   The USAir retrenchment, including Friday's move, affects500 managers, 211 pilots, 650 flight attendants and 2,100reservations, customer service and fleet service agents. Someother employees would also be affected.   USAir didn't say how much it expected to save as a resultof the layoffs. But it has been clear for some time that thecompany had fat to trim from its operating expenses. USAir'slabor costs have been among the highest in an industry wherepayroll is the biggest expense. Its merger with Piedmontincreased those costs.   USAir indicated that the layoffs might be expensive in theshort run. It said it is &quot;reviewing&quot; early retirement andvoluntary separation programs, which typically involveone-time payments to employees as compensation for leavingtheir jobs.   USAir announced the latest move after the close of tradingFriday. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,USAir stock closed at $14.375 a share, up 12.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
