Furthermore,there will be no adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States enterprisesto compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic or import markets.This action is not expected to substantially affect budget outlay or affectmore than one Agency or be controversial. The net result is to providebetter service to rural communities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background/Discussion </ITAG>Congregate housing is a unique form of Multiple Family Housing. It shouldnot be confused with or be considered an expansion of an elderly housingproject. Congregate housing consists of private apartments and centraldining facilities in which services are provided to tenants to enable themto remain independent. Tenants must not require the supervision or additionalservices provided by an intermediate health care facility. Although current FmHA regulations contain instructions on making congregatehousing loans, additional and more concise guidance is essential to improveprogram delivery and to aid in the development of successful congregatehousing. The major highlights of the proposed revisions include:Subpart E of Part 1944 <ITAG tagnum="15">_Arranges all instructions pertaining to congregate housing in specificareas. Differentiates between congregate housing and group homes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Provides additional design criteria for congregate housing and grouphomes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Describes support services necessary for congregate housing and grouphomes; lists specific information that must be provided to FmHA on eachservice component. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Provides that developers without actual experience or training inthe development and management of congregate housing consult with personsor entities experienced with same. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Expands the information required in market studies for congregatehousing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Contains Exhibit E which provides further guidance to applicantson the type of information needed at the preapplication stage.</ITAG>ExhibitJ of Subpart C of Part 1930 is added and: <ITAG tagnum="15">_Details the management requirements of congregate housing and grouphomes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Provides that developers without actual experience or training inthe development and management of congregate housing consult with personsor entities experienced with same. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Provides further guidance on eligible tenants. Distinguishes betweentenants who need the services to remain independent and tenants who donot need, but desire services to remain independent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Stipulates that tenants who need services to remain independent mustagree to use and pay for such services as a condition of occupancy. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Permits borrowers to maintain separate waiting lists for tenantswho need services to remain independent and those who do not need, butdesire services to remain independent.</ITAG>At the current time, the aforementioned regulations contain guidance oncongregate housing and group homes. As mentioned, all information on congregatehousing and group homes will be contained in specific locations ratherthan dispersed sporadically throughout the regulation. References changesand the removal of existing guidance on congregate and group housing arenot contained in this rulemaking document. The proposed instruction andexhibits to be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> are included in this rulemaking document. <ITAG tagnum="84">Programs Affected </ITAG>These programs/activities are listed in the Catalog of Federal DomesticAssistance under Numbers 10.415, Rural Rental Housing Loans and 10.427,Rural Rental Assistance Payments. <ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Consultation </ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule related Notice(s) to 7 CFRPart 3015, Subpart V, programs 10.415 Rural Rental Housing Loans and 10.427_RuralRental Assistance Payments are subject to Executive Order 12372 which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact Statement </ITAG>This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that theproposed action does not constitute a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment and in accordance with theNational Environmental Policy Act of 1949, Pub. L. 91-90, an EnvironmentalImpact Statement is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>This proposed rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). The undersigned hasdetermined and certified by signature of this document that this rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities since this rulemaking action does not involve a new or expandedprogram. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>7 CFR Part 1930 Accounting, Administrative practice and procedure, Grant programs_Housingand community development, Loan programs_Housing and community development,Low and moderate income housing_Rental, Reporting requirements. 7 CFR Part 1944 Administrative practice and procedure, Aged, Handicapped, Loan programs_Housingand community development, Low and moderate income housing_Rental, Mortgages,Nonprofit organizations, Rent subsidies, Rural housing.Therefore, as proposed, Chapter XVIII, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations,is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1930_GENERAL </ITAG>1.

Tenants who need the services to remain independent must agreeto use them as a condition of occupancy in the project. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B <T3>Tenant selection. </T3>Borrowers must meet the provisions of paragraphVI E of Exhibit B of this subpart. In congregate housing and group homes,a further critical dimension is added for the selection and placement oftenants. This involves determining the ability of a tenant to sustain independencewith the support services provided. Borrowers should be further guidedby the following in selecting tenants for congregate housing and grouphomes: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1 <T3>Congregate housing. </T3>a <T3>Tenant mix. </T3>Most tenants living in congregate housing will bepeople who can live independently who will be able to extend their independenceby using services available at the project. Some tenants may need servicesto enable them to remain independent. Borrowers must establish, in writing,a plan for ensuring an appropriate mix of tenants. The plan should establisha maximum percentage of tenants who need services to remain independent.We suggest that 15 to 30 percent of the tenants should need the servicesto remain independent. As existing tenants age, the percentage may increase.FmHA must concur with the proposed plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b <T3>Determining ability to be independent. </T3>(1) An evaluation of theability of tenants to sustain independence with the support services providedby the project must be made. This evaluation must be made by a qualifiedtenant selection committee, which includes a professional medical member,and presented to project management for concurrence. A tenant's likelihoodof sustaining independence as a result of living in congregate housingshould be verified by one of the following methods: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Certification by a physician or an agency responsible for supportservices as to a person's ability to remain independent with assistancefrom services. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) By the use of any objective guide, such as Exhibits B 10 and B10A of this subpart. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) When a determination is made concerning a tenant's need for services,he/she will be notified and placed on an appropriate waiting list and thetenant file and/or lease will be documented accordingly. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c <T3>Waiting lists. </T3>To sustain a balanced mix of tenants, managementmay maintain a separate waiting list for fully independent tenants andtenants who need services to remain independent. Management may choosetenants in order to assure a balanced project as described in paragraphV B 1 (a) of this exhibit. Selection of new tenants should be based onthe predetermined tenant mix ratio. If necessary to maintain a balancedproject, fully independent tenants may be chosen over tenants who needservices or vice versa. The other provisions contained in paragraph VIE of Exhibit B of this subpart concerning waiting lists are applicable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2 <T3>Group homes. </T3>A group home may limit occupancy to eligible developmentallydisabled, elderly or handicapped people. This limitation will be outlinedin the borrower's management plan. The following will apply to group homes:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a Tenants of group homes cannot be required to be a part of an ongoingtraining or rehabilitation program sponsored by the applicant or otherorganization. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b Prospective tenants may be selected from the local, regional and/orstate-wide market area, with priority preference in that order. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C <T3>Determining per unit rental rates for group living arrangements. </T3>A``unit'' in a group home consists of the space occupied by a specific tenanthousehold.

I further agree to use and pay for services as a conditionof continued occupancy if management determines that I cannot live independentlywithout them. If I am determined to need services but cannot afford them,I will voluntarily move from this project.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C <T3>Services provided to others than tenants of FmHA financed congregatehousing.</T3> If the meal facility serves others than the tenants of theproject, the applicant must obtain a lease from the service provider andrequire payment sufficient to cover the annual operating expenses, debtservices and reserve account attributable to the leased portion of theproject.

It applies in addition toall other applicable requirements contained elsewhere in this subpart.Congregate housing and group homes are types of section 515 rural rentalhousing that require a broader commitment from applicants to ensure thatneeded and desired services will be provided to prospective tenants. Theconcept may not be desired or feasible in all market areas. Congregatehousing is unique and has many components. It is not merely an elderlyhousing project with services. It must be designed and managed to meetthe needs of aging tenants. The management of congregate housing requiressupervision of support services and more interaction and oversight of tenants.We strongly recommend that applicants who have not dealt with this typeof housing obtain assistance from organizations or individuals who haveexperience in planning and designing congregate housing. (a) <T3>Congregate housing. </T3>Congregate housing will create an environmentthat will enable fully independent individuals to maintain their independencelonger by making available nutritious meals and other services. Congregatehousing will also help people who need some services to extend an independentlifestyle. (1) <T3>Eligible tenants. </T3>Eligible tenants are described in  andSection;1944.205(h) of this subpart and paragraph V A of Exhibit J of Subpart Cof Part 1930 of this chapter. Tenants who need the services to remain independentmust agree to use them as a condition of occupancy in the project. Fullyindependent tenants who do not want to participate in the services shouldbe encouraged to explore the availability of housing offered by noncongregateelderly projects. (2) <T3>Design criteria. </T3>Applicants must pay particular attention to thelayout of the structure and the effect of design elements on project managementand ongoing operations. Applicants should engage the services of an architectexperienced in congregate design. The initial planning of congregate housingshould include input on design considerations from project management toprevent the potential long-term affects of poorly conceived design on operations.Congregate housing must be planned and developed in accordance with SubpartsA and C of Part 1924 of this chapter. In addition, it must meet the followingdesign criteria: (i) Applicants must pay particular attention to the site requirements containedin andSection; 1944.215(p) of this subpart. Congregate housing should belocated as close to services and shopping as possible. Transportation mustbe made available to tenants of congregate housing, but the availabilityof transportation is not to be used as a substitute for good site location.(ii) Facilities needed to accommodate the services described in andSection;1944.224(a)(4) of this section must be designed in accordance with acceptablepractices. Specific design guidelines are provided in Chapter 1 of Guide2 of Subpart A of Part 1924 of this chapter. These facilities may be largerthan necessary to meet the tenants' requirements if they are needed inthe community and other sources of funds are available to pay a pro ratashare of the cost. (iii) The decreasing physical and mental capabilities of the tenants mustbe considered in the design. The walkways and corridors between livingunits and the support service facilities must be safe, comfortable andminimal in length. Handrails that comply with the Uniform Federal AccessibilityStandards must be provided on at least one side of all public corridors.(iv) Areas used by the tenants will be separated as much as possible fromareas needed for delivery of food and supplies and other building services.Interior spaces and finish materials must be residential in character anddesigned to help prevent tenants from becoming disoriented within the building(s).(v) Emergency lighting must be provided in every public space, corridor,stairway, elevator and other means of egress.(vi) The entrances to all living units must be on a route accessible tothe physically handicapped. Living units accessible only via exterior stepsor interior stairs will not be acceptable.(vii) The size of rooms and spaces in the living units must be comparableto units provided in other housing for the elderly. Kitchen facilitiesmust be provided in all living units and include, as a minimum, a cooktop,oven, sink, refrigerator and a food preparation surface.(viii) The bathroom and one bedroom in each living unit, and any publictoilet rooms, must be furnished with an emergency call system that is appropriatefor the size and management of the housing facility.(3)<T3> Management of congregate projects.</T3> Applicants must meet the provisionsof Exhibit J of Subpart C of Part 1930 of this chapter in managing congregatehousing. In addition to the elements of managing a typical rural rentalhousing project, congregate housing requires increased management experienceand skills. Delivery of services, oversight of tenants and the decisionmakingprocess of tenant selection adds a unique dimension to prudent management.The success or failure of a project will rely heavily upon management effectivenessand delivery of services. Applicants who are not experienced with congregatehousing must seek assistance from organizations or individuals experiencedwith congregate issues in developing the management and servicing plans.A separate plan detailing the delivery of services must be submitted withthe preapplication. Applicants must also submit separate budgets for operationand maintenance of the project and services.(4)<T3> Support services.</T3> Exhibit E of this Subpart must be addressedin planning services. Adequate services must be offered to extend the independenceof tenants and be reasonably priced to ensure affordability by very low-and low-income tenants. A wide variety of services may be offered; however,in most cases the following services should be provided:(i)<T3> Meals.</T3> Since some tenants will depend on the meal service astheir only sustenance, at least one cooked meal a day, 7 days a week, mustbe provided. There may be cases where the meal provider does not furnishmeals on a daily basis. On days the meal provider does not furnish meals,an alternate source must provide meals to tenants who are not inclinedto prepare their own meals. The following conditions apply to meals:(A) To ensure that the meals are wholesome and meet the needs of individualtenants, a professionally trained dietitian or nutritionist must be involvedin planning the menus.(B) The feasibility of sustained meal service may be dependent on the numberof people who elect to pay for it. Tenants who choose to live in a congregatefacility should be expected to participate in the meal program; therefore,applicants should solicit tenant participation in the meal service if theeconomic feasibility of the service depends on user charges.(C) If the entity that operates the service is eligible to accept foodstamps under the regulations of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) ofthe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the entity must beauthorized by FNS to accept food stamps from tenants for the purchase ofmeals.(ii) <T3>Transportation.</T3> Transportation must be provided to the projecton a fixed schedule based on tenant needs. Applicants are encouraged towork with public and private transportation sources to develop a dependableand economical method for providing this service. If these sources cannotprovide adequate transportation, the applicant must develop a project-sponsoredtransportation system.(iii) <T3>Housekeeping.</T3> Housekeeping services must be provided to tenantswho require assistance in keeping their units clean. Light housekeepingtasks, such as dusting, vacuuming, floor washing, bathroom cleaning andlaundry for bedding, generally should be provided on a weekly basis. Heaviertasks, such as oven cleaning, window cleaning and drapery cleaning, shouldbe provided periodically.(iv) <T3>Personal services. </T3>Limited nonmedical personal services must bemade available to tenants who need them to remain independent. Personalservices can include such items as assistance with personal hygiene, nutritioncounseling and general health screening.
