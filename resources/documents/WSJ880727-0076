The agricultural seed concern said the offer, which is commission free, is being made in response to the requests of some holders who have continued to keep an open account because of the cost or inconvenience of selling a small number of shares. The Des Moines, Iowa, company also cited the high cost of servicing smaller shareholder accounts as an additional reason for making the offer.    The company, which has 31.8 million shares outstanding, said participating shareholders will receive the average of the closing market prices for the days from July 25 through Aug. 31. The offer expires Aug. 31.    Pioneer's stock closed in national over-the-counter trading yesterday at $34.75 a share, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
