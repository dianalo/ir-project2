The U.S. likes to spend. Japan likes to save. And as the U.S. has run up record budget deficits, Japanese investors have emerged as some of the biggest buyers of U.S. Treasury bonds, snapping up nearly one-third of the paper at recent quarterly auctions.    But will they continue? It's a question that gives central bankers nightmares -- especially as the Japanese have recently lost some of their appetite for financing America's borrowings. &quot;It's crazy,&quot; said a senior official of the Bank of Japan last week. &quot;Yesterday, the interest-rate spread was 5.5%, and still we didn't see any big outflow&quot; of Japanese capital into U.S. government bonds. He was referring to the gap between the yields of long-term U.S. and Japanese government bonds.    With the May quarterly auction of U.S. Treasury bonds fast approaching, the concerns of monetary authorities in both Japan and the U.S. are growing more acute. Last week, amid talks between President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, the U.S. and Japan announced that they are adjusting their interest rates to stem the dollar's fall and make U.S. bonds more attractive to foreigners.    Regardless of whether the initiative succeeds, it has thrust into the spotlight the growing importance of Japanese capital in holding together the world economy. As money flows back and forth across national borders at ever-increasing velocity, pushing interest rates up and down and jarring both exchange rates and securities prices, any major shift in Japanese investment spending holds the potential for economic disruption.    Thus, influencing Japanese investor psychology takes on a critical importance in managing the fragile world economy. It's a psychology, financial analysts in Japan say, that is opportunistic, yet risk-averse, and almost as volatile as the financial markets themselves.    &quot;The Japanese are bull-market players, not bear-market players,&quot; says an American stockbroker in Tokyo. If they perceive that the dollar-yen rate is stabilizing as a result of credit-tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and simultaneous loosening by the Bank of Japan, analysts say, they might well start pouring money back into America. The next couple of weeks should show whether that will happen.    Messrs. Reagan and Nakasone Friday attempted to reassure the financial markets that the interest-rate coordination was more than just a gesture. In a joint statement, they pledged to continue their countries' close cooperation in restoring dollar-yen stability and said that &quot;a further decline in the dollar could be counterproductive.&quot;    A portent of the recent monetary turbulence came in March, when big Japanese institutions sold off billions of dollars in U.S. Treasury bonds. In reaction, the dollar plunged and interest rates shot up. Economists began warning about the dangers of rising inflation and even of a world recession.    Those dangers remain. &quot;It isn't a crisis, but the problems are getting bigger than before,&quot; says Shijuro Ogata, former deputy governor of the Bank of Japan and currently a senior official of the Japan Development Bank. &quot;The problems are more serious than last year, when the yen was at 180 and (Fed Chairman) Paul Volcker started to shout.&quot; The dollar has since fallen to about 140 yen.    Indeed, a full-scale retreat of foreign investors from the U.S. financial markets could spell serious trouble for the U.S. economy. Borrowing costs for home buyers and for business could soar, increasing the threat of recession. And a new dollar decline would probably worsen U.S. inflation and hobble the Japanese economy.    And yet, analysts in both countries see signs that the Japanese are tiptoeing back into the market. Two weeks ago, for instance, Mitsubishi Trust andamp; Banking Corp. bought $200 million of Treasury bonds. &quot;It was contrary, it was very different from what most Japanese institutions have been doing,&quot; says Kei Yanagisawa, a portfolio manager at Mitsubishi Trust. But, he adds, his bank couldn't resist the 8%-plus interest rate.    Some Tokyo officials predict that Japan's net purchase of foreign stocks and bonds will rebound after falling to about $6 billion in March, the latest month for which figures are available, from $11 billion in February. They also expect the big Japanese brokerage houses to remain major participants in U.S. Treasury bonds. That's especially true of Nomura Securities Co. and Daiwa Securities Co., which were awarded the status of &quot;primary dealer&quot; of U.S. Treasury securities in December.    Still, a mood of extreme wariness pervades the investment community. Even before the dollar's latest plunge, Japanese institutional investors had been busily diversifying their portfolios, shifting away from U.S. Treasury securities and into American stocks and British, German, Canadian and Australian government bonds. They were also putting more money to work at home.    &quot;It's not a carefully organized plan. People are moving into non-dollar securities in an opportunistic way,&quot; says Nobumitsu Kagami, managing director of Nomura Investment Management Co., which manages about $9 billion in assets.    In part, Japanese institutions are motivated by the simple desire to spread their risks. &quot;We have too much money,&quot; says Hiroshi Takeuchi, chief economist of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. &quot;Money goes into land. Money goes to buy stocks, art, golf memberships. We want to find a place where money will be comfortable.&quot;    Japanese investors have begun managing their portfolios more aggressively by searching the world for potential bull markets, and trading in and out of stocks and bonds in hopes of a quick capital gain.    They have also driven the Japanese stock market to speculative levels -- up almost 50% during the past 12 months -- in no small part through old-fashioned speculation. &quot;The whole nation is really trading on margin. That's a scary situation,&quot; says Mr. Kagami of Nomura Investment Management Co.    Over the past couple of years, corporations have turned more and more toward a form of investment nicknamed &quot;zaitech,&quot; or &quot;financial technology.&quot; They borrow from banks or issue bonds, then invest the money in financial assets, especially stocks.    It's a money game that is being abetted by the big Japanese banks, which are bulging with cash. &quot;There's a battle of survival in the banking world,&quot; says Rikio Takezawa, deputy general manager of Sanwa Bank Ltd. &quot;There's lots of pressure on bankers to lend.&quot;    Individual Japanese investors are also borrowing heavily from the commercial banks, often using as collateral their homes or other real estate that has skyrocketed in value in recent years, in order to invest in stocks and bonds.    A lot of the money sloshing around Japan has spilled over onto Wall Street, where price-earnings ratios are much more down-to-earth than in Tokyo. In March, the net purchase of foreign equities by Japanese investors exceeded $2.9 billion, a record.    A majority of analysts say it is inevitable that large amounts of Japanese money will continue flowing into U.S. stocks and bonds alike. The U.S. financial markets are large, liquid and increasingly global, and dollar investments are widely considered the safest haven in the world.    The prospects of a stabilizing yen-dollar rate and a widening spread between U.S. and Japanese bond yields are powerful inducements to investors who are comparison-shopping the global government-bond markets, analysts say.    Yet another factor likely to keep Japanese institutions in U.S. Treasuries is the sheer size of the investment they've already made. The more Treasury securities sold by the Japanese, the more likely the dollar will fall, further damaging the value of the U.S. dollar-denominated securities remaining in their portfolios.    &quot;If they divest, it's self-defeating,&quot; says Mr. Ogata of Japan Development Bank.    All of that has left many institutions in a quandary. &quot;It's a really difficult decision that people have to make at the moment,&quot; says Hidefumi Kashiwada, an official of the Life Insurance Association of Japan. &quot;Most think the high yen will continue, yet there are advantages to buying and holding Treasury securities.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
