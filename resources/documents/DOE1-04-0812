It is shown that the M/subi/-M/sub f/ relation obtained on the basis of mass estimates for thewhite dwarfs in clusters in our Galaxy [10] is apparently incorrect.Estimates of M/sub i/ and J/sub f/ for the stars for the clusters inthe Magellanic Clouds and comparison of these values with the theoreticallyobtained values show that the rate of mass loss by stars in the LargeMagellanic Cloud exceeds the loss rate in the Small Magellanic Cloud.The mass distribution of white dwarfs in galaxies must depend on theinitial chemical composition of the stars.</TEXT></DOC>
