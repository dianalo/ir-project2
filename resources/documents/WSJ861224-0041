The Parachute Creek facility is the only plant to be built of many that were proposed during the energy crisis. It is designed to heat oil shale, releasing from the rock a substance known as kerogen that then is processed into synthetic crude oil.    A company spokesman said the facility is producing at a rate of about 4,000 barrels a day in a series of runs. It isn't in continuous production, he said.    To date, Unocal has spent some $900 million at Parachute Creek. The facility is designed to produce 10,000 barrels a day and was to have been in production several years ago. A government contract guarantees Unocal a subsidized price that is currently about $35 a barrel and will rise in the future for the first 20 million barrels of synthetic crude produced by the facility.    Unocal has had extensive difficulties with the facility. While early experiments with scale models suggested that the plant's design was workable, the vastly larger production version literally choked on its own dust in many trial runs. Recent modifications have permitted the plant to run at reduced rates. But it is believed that full production can only be achieved with modifications that would cost about $500 million.    Unocal has declined to discuss details of its experiences at the site. The facility was the subject of a front-page article in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. </TEXT></DOC>
