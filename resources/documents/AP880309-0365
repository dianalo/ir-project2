On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for Aprildelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude oil,settled at $15.45 per barrel Tuesday, up 8 cents from Monday'sclose.   Among refined products, wholesale heating oil gained 0.08 centto 43.49 cents a gallon. Near-term contracts for wholesale gasolinedipped 0.23 cent to 43.71 cents a gallon.   Analysts said longer-term contracts for both crude and theproducts were stronger, reflecting sentiment that key world oilproducers may yet agree on ways to limit production and stabilizeprices.   In gasoline, for example, the September contract gained 0.41cent to 43.70 cents a gallon on hopes for firmer prices and astrong summer driving season.   Helping support prices Tuesday was Egypt's announcement thatnon-OPEC oil producers would meet today in London. Venezuela alsoreportedly called for more future meetings of the 13-nationOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, analysts said.   Members of both groups appear anxious to address the problem ofprice discounting by some oil producers, said Bob Baker, an analystfor Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   But analysts said meetings alone would not dissolve the world'soil glut.   ``There will have to be some kind of results or we'll continueto see these kinds of prices,'' said John Hill of Merrill LynchEnergy Futures.</TEXT></DOC>
