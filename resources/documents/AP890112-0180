Lee Hak-bong, a member of parliament from the party in power, theDemocratic Justice Party, was charged with taking bribes and withaiding corrupt relatives of Chun while he was Chun's chiefpresidential secretary.   Lee served as a top official at government security organizationsafter helping Chun seize power with military backing in 1980.   His was the first such arrest of a government lawmaker accused ofcorruption. Prosecutors in recent weeks have arrested governmentofficials on charges of extorting money from businesses, divertinggovernment funds, selling influence and forcing political donations.   Chun has denied any personal corruption, but his relatives,associates and former government ministers have been arrested orconvicted of dishonest practices. The former president went intorural exile last month after apologizing for misdeeds under his rule.   President Roh Tae-woo, once a close ally of Chun, asked Koreansto forgive his disgraced predecessor. But the opposition says itwill not agree to consider a pardon for Chun until he appears for aNational Assembly probe.   The opposition-controled assembly has been investigatingallegations of human rights violations and other wrongdoings underChun's seven-year rule, which ended in February 1988.   Prosecutors also on Thursday questioned Kim Ju-ho, former head ofthe Office of Supply, on charges of selling influence in importingrice from the United States.   The prosecutors spoke on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
