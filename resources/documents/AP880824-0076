(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A three-year undercover operation hasresulted in charges against 43 people accused of poaching blackbears for their gall bladders, which are prized in Asia asaphrodisiacs and medicine.   The federal-state probe was sparked by the danger poaching posesto the nation's black bear population, Gary Myers, executivedirector of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, said Tuesdayin announcing the charges.   During the investigation, agents bought 266 gall bladders, 85claws, 77 feet, four heads, nine hides and one live black bear cub,officials said.   Among the items displayed at a news conference Tuesday wereseveral plastic bags containing a bear's gall bladder, whichresembles a swollen, heavily veined lima bean.   The parts were sold to Asians in the United States and overseas,said Tim Hergenrader of the Tennessee wildlife agency. He said thegall bladder is dried and ground into a powder thought to be goodfor health and an aphrodisiac.   Bear claws are used to make jewelry, and heads are used astrophies, Hergenrader said.   Arrest warrants were issued in Knoxville, Asheville, N.C., andAtlanta for residents of the three states, and agents began makingarrests early Tuesday.   Hergenrader said the 43 people were charged with more than 130federal and state violations.   Officials estimate the black bear population in the southernAppalachians at about 2,000. The bears already are threatened by aloss of habitat. Areas in public land are set aside as bear habitatwhere hunting is prohibited.   Hergenrader said some of the bears were legitimately killed, buthe said it is illegal to sell any part of a bear no matter how orwhere it is killed.   Myers said studies of the black bears indicated that ``we weredriving our black bear population to extinction'' and that poachingaccounted for half or more of the annual bear deaths.   He described the poachers as ``a loose, informal network ofpeople who knew who you needed to see if you want bear gallbladders.''</TEXT></DOC>
