Theunpleasant surprise was that it turned out to be a terribleyear.   The collapse of the junk-bond market, a bank credit crunchand the sagging economy wiped out most leveraged buy-outs andother deals that needed debt financing. Then in August, thetrickle of activity remaining was shut off by Iraq's invasionof Kuwait, as skyrocketing oil prices made a hash of mostbusiness projections.</LP><TEXT>   As Wall Street began dismantling much of the 1980sdeal-making machinery, with heavy layoffs of both bankers andlawyers, the only consolation at year end was two big dealsthat showed Mandamp;A hasn't died out completely.   In a sign of the times, both deals were driven bycorporate strategy instead of easy credit. MatsushitaElectric Industrial Co. agreed to acquire MCA Inc. for $5.59billion to lock in a supply of movies for its TVs andvideocassette players. And American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.made a $6.12 billion hostile bid for NCR Corp. in an effortto buy success in the computer business where ATandamp;T's ownefforts have failed.   The volume of announced takeover bids world-wide fell 31%to $446.2 billion in 1990, according to Securities Data Co.The drop in U.S. deals, still the biggest factor in theworld-wide totals, was more dramatic. Announced bids for U.S.targets were down 46%, and down 60% from the high-water markof 1988, the year of the record $25 billion buy-out of RJRNabisco Inc.   The falloff in U.S. activity was illustrated by the factthat the largest U.S. deal completed in 1990, the $14.1billion acquisition of Warner Communications Inc. by TimeInc., was announced in mid-1989 and closed in January 1990.   By comparison, merger activity in Europe, where companiesare consolidating furiously before the advent of a unifiedmarket by the end of 1992, held steady in 1990, according toSecurities Data. Another sign of strong activity outside theU.S. was the year's largest completed deal, a $23.02 billionmerger of two giant Japanese banks.   Within the U.S., Lazard Freres andamp; Co. general partner FelixRohatyn observes: &quot;We saw the end of the megadeal. Theexpectation that we're going to have $10 billion to $15billion deals is pretty much over.&quot;   Stephen Waters, co-head of mergers and acquisitions atMorgan Stanley andamp; Co., said, &quot;I don't think people believed1990 would be as difficult as it wound up being until theKuwaiti invasion.&quot; After the invasion, Mr. Waters said, &quot;alot of acquisition decisions were just plain put on hold.&quot;   Mike Overlock, head of mergers and acquisitions atGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said the eclipse of corporate raidersand leveraged buy-outs, along with the weakening economy,&quot;resulted in less Mandamp;A activity, with fewer divestitures,restructurings and recapitalizations.&quot;   Leveraged buy-outs were down 69%, according to IDDInformation Services Inc. Forstmann Little andamp; Co. was one ofthe few LBO firms still buying, using its own subordinateddebt fund to help finance purchases of the GulfstreamAerospace unit of Chrysler Corp., and General InstrumentCorp. By contrast, Clayton andamp; Dubilier had to struggle tocomplete a $2-billion-plus buy-out of several low-techbusiness lines being sold by International Business MachinesCorp.   Many buy-out funds were sellers in 1990, looking forcorporations with a business reason to buy some of theirholdings. In two of the largest sales, Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co. sold Beatrice Cos. to ConAgra Inc. for $3.29billion, and sold Motel 6 L.P. to Accor S.A., a Frenchlodging company, for $2.3 billion.   With buy-out funds and corporate raiders on the sidelines,far more deals were friendly, negotiated mergers betweencorporations with common business interests, often to expandinternationally. &quot;The preponderance of activity that'soccurring now is corporate activity,&quot; says James Maher, vicechairman and head of investment banking at First Boston Corp.   In pharmaceuticals, the French firm Rhone-Poulenc S.A.acquired the U.S.-based Rorer Group Inc. Philip Morris Cos.acquired Swiss food giant Jacobs Suchard AG. And two Europeanauto makers, France's Renault and Sweden's AB Volvo, formed a$3.6 billion joint venture.   Several of the year's largest deals were sales ofstate-owned businesses by foreign governments eager to raisecash and generate new investment. New Zealand and Argentinasold their telephone companies, and Argentina sold itsairline. However, some of those big price tags were inflatedby counting Argentine debt at face value instead of itsdiscounted market value.   Many investment bankers idled by the deal slowdown alsofound work restructuring companies that took on too much debtin big deals of years gone by. The best known basket casesincluded Campeau Corp., which sought bankruptcy-lawprotection from creditors early in the year after buying twogiant U.S. retailers; Southland Corp., the convenience-storeoperator; and the Texas Air Corp. units Eastern andContinental airlines. Like privatizations, however, such workis slower, chancier and less lucrative.   With tougher state takeover laws and the proliferation ofcorporate anti-takeover devices, a few hostile biddersresorted to a weapon that had fallen into disuse, the proxyfight, to break down takeover barriers. Georgia-Pacific Corp.used the threat of a proxy battle to acquire Great NorthernNekoosa Corp., and BTR PLC drove Norton Co. into the arms ofa French rescuer. But two corporate raiders, Carl Icahn andHarold Simmons, lost proxy challenges against USX Corp. andLockheed Corp.   The bid-and-proxy model was even adopted by ATandamp;T in itssiege of NCR. Some investment bankers believe the willingnessof ATandamp;T, one of the most conservative U.S. corporations, towage a hostile takeover battle could prove a significantlegacy of the 1980s' merger mayhem.   Lazard's Mr. Rohatyn called the ATandamp;T move &quot;a watershed&quot;that &quot;may change the rules of the game for many people,because clearly it is as dramatic a change in corporatebehavior as was International Nickel's hostile bid {for abattery company} in the 1970s.&quot;   Just as there fewer deals done in 1990, there were alsomore failed deals, busted auctions, and buy-outs thatcouldn't get done. For the second year in a row, the mostprominent example was a union-led effort to acquire UnitedAirlines parent UAL Corp. After a $300-a-share buy-outcollapsed in 1989, a $201-a-share effort faltered during thesummer because of tight bank credit, and failed definitivelyafter the Mideast crisis sent jet fuel prices soaring. In1990's collapse, UAL stock fell from $171 to $85.   Other auctions that flopped included Hilton Hotels Corp.,whose stock fell from over $115, at the peak of takeoverspeculation in mid-1989, to under $27 a share in the spring;American General Corp., whose stock fell from over $50 tobelow $24 during a disappointing auction; Castle andamp; CookeInc., which decided against selling its Dole Food subsidiary;and Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc., whose stock fellfrom $25 to under $15 after canceling a plan to sell theentire company.   The stock-price carnage took its toll on takeover stocktraders, known as arbitragers. Many of Wall Street's bestknown arbs lost their jobs after suffering losses, includingWilliam Kaye of PaineWebber Inc., Guy Wyser-Pratte ofPrudential-Bache Securities Inc., Brian McVeigh of theBlackstone Group, and David Nolan of Spear Leeds andamp; Kellogg.   Few investment bankers expect any dramatic change in theactivity level for the coming year. &quot;I would look to 1991 asan evening-off year -- not way below 1990, but not coming inanywhere near the 1988-89 levels either,&quot; says Scott A.Levine, head of mergers and acquisitions at J.P. Morgan andamp; Co.One big swing factor will be the outcome of the Mideaststandoff.   ---             The Biggest Deals Completed in 1990                                                                                                                                         TRANSACTION       VALUE* BUYER          ACQUISITION       TYPE         (In billions)                                                                                                        Mitsui Bank    Taiyo Kobe        Stock                                                                                                        Time Inc.
