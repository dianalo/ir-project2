Signs of an involuntary cutback began to surface yesterdayeven as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriescalled an emergency meeting aimed at reducing output andreversing the price slide. The session is to begin May 2 inGeneva.</LP><TEXT>   The expectation that OPEC might regain productiondiscipline produced at least a brief turnaround in thedepressed oil market, pushing some crude prices up as much as$1 a barrel.   But just in the last week or so, the organization'sproduction already has been trimmed by 400,000 to 600,000barrels a day, according to confidential reports by people inand out of OPEC who monitor its production.   That puts total OPEC output at around 23.5 million barrelsa day -- still 1.5 million barrels over the ceiling but wellbelow the eight-year high of 24 million barrels a day thatwas reached only two to three weeks ago. That level of outputsent world petroleum prices skidding.   People who monitor OPEC output said the cutbacks appear tobe widespread and reflect a shortage of buyers -- and tankers-- for OPEC's flood of oil, and not any sudden resurgence inthe organization's ability to keep its chronic quota cheatersin line.   &quot;There is too much oil chasing too few buyers, and somemember countries are throttling back,&quot; said a senior OPECofficial.   The lower OPEC output is coming at a critical time forworld oil markets. Production probably isn't low enough yetto eliminate the oil glut, but it is likely to resurrectearlier industry projections of firming oil markets by latethis quarter, or certainly in the second half.   Barring recessions in the bigger oil-consuming nations,petroleum demand is widely projected to increase in thesecond half. For OPEC, that rise is expected to translateinto a gain of two million barrels a day or more from itscurrent level.   The second quarter is traditionally a sluggish period foroil demand. Although estimates vary widely, demand for OPECoil is estimated to be running at 21 million to 22 millionbarrels a day currently. But up until the last several days,OPEC continued to pump oil at much higher rates, averagingsome 23.8 million barrels daily in March.   As a result, OPEC oil has begun to back up in storage andat sea.   It is difficult to say exactly how much oil might be atsea at any given time. &quot;But it's safe to say that it's thehighest we have seen for this time of the year in the lasttwo or three years,&quot; said a European tracker of oil tankers.   Roy Mason, a Yorkshire, England, oil statistician andpublisher of Oil Afloat, which monitors tanker traffic,estimated that there are currently 430 million barrels of oilat sea. That's below the 450 million barrels on the water atthe beginning of this year but well above the 385 millionbarrels a year ago, he said.   More important, a larger than usual portion of the oilappears to be owned by producing countries instead of tradersor refiners, he said. &quot;What may well be true,&quot; he said, &quot;isthat there is more unsold oil on the water than in the pasttwo years.&quot;   It isn't for lack of trying that producers don't have morebuyers. Nearly all OPEC members -- from Saudi Arabia, thelargest exporter, to Ecuador, one of the smallest -- recentlyhave been sweetening pricing terms, offering new discounts.   Yesterday, Ecuador oil officials confirmed an offer toreduce the pricing formula for their export crude, calculatedon the basis of spot prices of some other crudes, by 40 centsa barrel. But not all customers have accepted the new offer,which came after lengthy negotiations. So Ecuador may have tostore even more of its oil in tankers in the Caribbean.   Ecuador isn't alone. Iran is said to have at least fiveand perhaps as many as eight so-called VLCCs (very largecrude carriers) full of unsold oil off Europe.   Energy Security Analysis Inc., which monitors supplies ofoil onshore, estimated 1.54 billion barrels of crude oil werein inventories at the end of March. That was up sharply fromthe 1.45 billion barrels it measured at the end of March1989.   Edward N. Krapels, president of the Washington firm, saidthat Energy Security's crude oil index is indicating a &quot;largesurplus&quot; for the first time in 15 months. The index measurescrude supplies in terms of days of refinery operations.   &quot;Sooner or later,&quot; said Mr. Krapels, &quot;there has to be aproduction response&quot; to the buildup of crude inventoriesbecause &quot;the buyers aren't there.&quot;   New tabulations show that production response already hascome from some countries. Several OPEC members aren'tproducing as much as their quotas allow. Although three bigPersian Gulf producers -- Kuwait, the United Arab Emiratesand Saudi Arabia -- remain above quota, their output appearsto be slipping. Current output of Saudi Arabia, OPEC'skingpin with a quota of 5.4 million barrels a day, is said tobe around 5.9 million. But much, if not all, the extra oil isunderstood to be going into storage.   The May 2 meeting of the oil ministers is intended toobtain voluntary cutbacks by all the overproducers. &quot;Weshould be able to get reductions at least for a couplemonths,&quot; said a senior official in one of the OPECdelegations.</TEXT></DOC>
