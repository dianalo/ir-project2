News Flash No. 2: Don't expect a repeat performance.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If a space project isn't fouled up, it got lucky,&quot; saysJohn Pike, a space analyst for the Federation of AmericanScientists.   Consider the differing fates of two big NASA projects. The$630 million Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, due to belaunched Thursday on the shuttle Discovery, is only one of 10large U.S. space projects that didn't overrun its budget,according to a study of 62 such projects by Mr. Pike. Thelesson of the upper-atmosphere orbiter is that its managerscombined political savvy with technological conservatism toshield the project from controversy and keep it moving aheadyear after year.   But that's the exception. The norm is more like the EarthObserving System, an environmental-satellite project that bysome estimates is now $13 billion above NASA's original costprojections, five years behind schedule and on the edge ofdisaster. Its managers overestimated their political supportand underestimated the technical challenges of the satellite.A White House panel plans to recommend soon that NASAradically revise the project, familiarly called EOS, tominimize additional delays and cost overruns.   &quot;EOS probably looked at the beginning like a blank check,&quot;says Gary Rottman, a University of Colorado scientist who hasdesigned instruments for both EOS and the upper-atmosphereorbiter.   The trouble is, many projects look like that at theoutset. According to Mr. Pike's study, the average spaceproject cost 2 1/2 times as much as promised and was 58%behind schedule.   The upper-atmosphere satellite, on the other hand, hasbecome a model at NASA for how to manage a big scienceproject. It grew out of a congressional requirement in 1976that NASA study the upper atmosphere for evidence ofdestruction of the ozone layer, which protects the Earth'ssurface from deadly ultraviolet rays. The satellite willmeasure a variety of chemicals at different altitudes tounderstand what causes the damage and how it spreadsglobally.   Managers of the atmospheric ozone satellite built on thatcongressional support by adopting realistic budgets and usingoff-the-shelf technology to reduce costs. Project scientistsquickly dropped plans for a four-satellite project -- deemingit too expensive -- and instead proposed a single satelliteto Congress. &quot;We read the tea leaves of what we could sell,&quot;says Carl Reber, the ozone satellite's chief scientist and aNASA veteran. &quot;We felt {a program of} over $1 billionwouldn't carry.&quot;   To cut costs and improve reliability, NASA managers basedthe spacecraft on a design that had been used several timesbefore, featuring plug-in modules for propulsion,communications and navigation. As a result, scientists whowere building unique atmospheric-measurement devices knewfrom the start how to tailor their instruments for the ozonesatellite. Exceptions weren't allowed.   NASA managers &quot;held the line,&quot; says John Gille, anatmospheric scientist at the National Center for AtmosphericResearch who has worked on the ozone satellite and itssuccessor, EOS. &quot;If scientists came in and said we could domore, they said no.&quot;   The ozone-satellite project hewed to its budget and neverbecame controversial in Congress or the White House budgetoffice. It proceeded almost unnoticed outside the spaceagency. &quot;We have been able to count on a plan,&quot; says MichaelLuther, the ozone satellite's manager at NASA headquarters.&quot;That's the No. 1 factor&quot; in a successful project, he adds.   EOS, by contrast, has been mired in controversy from thestart. Conceived in 1982 as a project to detect a broad rangeof environmental change on Earth, EOS was first included inNASA's space-station project, partly as a way to buildsupport among scientists and environmentalists for theproposed $40 billion station.   Later, the environmental satellite was split off from thespace station and became the centerpiece of the Bushadministration's environmental-change research program. Butthat gave the satellite an unfortunate new image as a crasheffort to study global warming -- even though it wasn'tsuited for that purpose. Project scientists planned to studychanges in Earth's environment for 15 years, starting aroundthe year 2000, providing far more data -- at a much laterdate -- than global-warming specialists needed.   The space agency proposed to build six of the largest,most complex satellites ever conceived for EOS and, to backthem up, one of the world's most sophisticated computersystems. The initial price tag: about $30 billion over 25years. Rather than cash in on support for environmentalprojects in Congress, the environmental satellite's vastscale ensured criticism by lawmakers and scientists whofeared it would rob funds from other projects.   The complexity of the spacecraft also meant NASA managerscouldn't use as many off-the-shelf satellite parts, making itdifficult for scientists to accurately predict the cost oftheir instruments. Privately, the environmental satellite'smanagers said the program's cost could easily rise bytwo-thirds to $50 billion. &quot;We keep restudying, rechangingthe numbers, reconfiguring the science,&quot; says Dr. Rottman,the University of Colorado atmospheric physicist.   Last year, the White House and Congress approved the startof the environmental-satellite project. But this year, bothhave backed off as the project's riskiness became apparent.The White House appointed a panel to recommend changes in thesatellite scheme, and the Senate ordered NASA to slash $5billion from the project's budget by the year 2000.   Albert Wheelon, a member of the White House panel andformer chairman of satellite-maker Hughes Aircraft Co., saysthe panel will recommend that the six gigantic EOS satellitesbe carved into 16 smaller ones. If scientists need to takesimultaneous readings of the environment, some satellites canbe launched together and flown in formation. By making thesatellites less complicated, panel members contend, NASA hasa better chance of avoiding technical problems that lead todelays and cost overruns.   The White House panel addresses another problem: the vaststretches of time it takes to get space projects off theground. The atomospheric ozone satellite is officiallyconsidered only two years behind schedule, accounting for thetime the launch was delayed because of the Challengerdisaster. However, the project was first proposed in 1978 andtook 13 years to get approved, designed, built and ready tolaunch -- four years longer than it took the U.S. to putastronauts on the moon.   So, says Edward Frieman, who headed the White House paneland is director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,the departments of Defense and Energy should be drafted tohelp get environmental data more quickly. His panel proposesthat the two departments launch a series of smallersatellites to study crucial elements of climate change suchas cloud coverage or ocean circulation -- missions usuallyreserved for NASA.   The White House report hasn't been made public yet, butNASA has been informed of its main recommendations andalready is grudgingly making the changes suggested. JeffDozier, the EOS project's chief scientist, says the programnow plans to launch a slimmed-down EOS satellite every 18months to 2 years. But he warns that the revised programwon't be able to do as much scientific research asanticipated because NASA will have to cancel some scientificinstruments to help pay for the additional spacecraft.   Moreover, scientists involved with both satellite projectsare skeptical that the Pentagon will do any better than NASAin launching scientific satellites quickly. Says Dr. Gille,the atmospheric scientist: &quot;The Defense Department is tryingto pull rabbits out of a hat.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
