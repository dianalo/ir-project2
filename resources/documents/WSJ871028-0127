Mr. Goldberg's mistake came straight out of the television program itself; but whereas there is no use worrying about television's accuracy or inaccuracy, what is printed in The Wall Street Journal becomes a permanent record.    In brief, the story about Marc Connelly is one of those transfers of jokes that always occur when a joke is good. The man really responsible for the line attributed to Connelly was, in fact, Nicholas Longworth when he was speaker of the House. Furthermore, his position gave the line its real point -- the point being that the speakership in Longworth's day was not the dingy partisan and money-raising post that it has now become. Instead, the speakership was what it was most recently in the time of the great Sam Rayburn, a high national office of extreme dignity.    A brash new member violated this dignity by stroking Longworth's bald head and saying that it reminded him of his wife's behind. When Longworth felt his head and quietly answered &quot;so it does,&quot; the purpose was to put brashness in its proper place.    Joseph Alsop   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
