Mosbacher told the Senate Commerce Committee at his confirmationhearing that he was concerned that U.S. manufacturers were losingground to foreign competitors in such areas as high-definitiontelevision.   Japan and other countries have been racing to develop thetechnology for clearer TV pictures with the prize amultibillion-dollar sales market for consumers worldwide.   ``We are losing the advantage we started out with in thehigh-technology area,'' Mosbacher said. ``It appears to me thatwhile it is very late in the game, it is not too late. We can getback in the game.''   Mosbacher said he did not have any specific recommendations tomake now but that this area would be a high priority once he tookoffice. He suggested there may be a need for new laws to waiveantitrust restrictions that would allow U.S. electronic companies towork together in developing high-definition TV.   ``A central challenge facing the Department of Commerce is tosupport U.S. economic growth and international competitiveness,''Mosbacher said in written testimony submitted earlier.   ``To meet this challenge we must promote a better climate forincreased U.S. exports (and) help American industry develop andapply new commercial technologies that will make us morecompetitive.''   Mosbacher was praised by many members of the committee and he wasexpected to have no trouble winning confirmation.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, introduced Mosbacher, a wealthyTexas oilman and longtime friend of President Bush, to the committeeas a ``friend, counselor, tough competitor and an internationalbusinessman.''   Bentsen, who was the Democratic vice presidential candidate andwas often critical of the Reagan administration's stance on trade,said he believed Mosbacher exemplified a new activism that Bushpromised in his inaugural address last Friday.   Committee Chairman Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., noted that theRepublican National Committee released on Monday a list of 249individuals and corporate representatives who gave at least $100,000to the Bush cause.   Common Cause, a citizen activist group, had urged the CommerceCommittee to delay Mosbacher's confirmation until the list was madepublic. Mosbacher, Bush's campaign finance chairman, raised morethan $25 million in large donations.   Hollings said that while the list of people willing to give$100,000 and more showed the need for limits on such contributions,he was satisfied with publication of the list and did not feel theissue would hold up Mosbacher's confirmation.   Among the goals Mosbacher cited in his Cabinet job were expandingU.S. trade, supporting research and development, working to clean upcoastal pollution and ensuring that next year's census was conductedfairly and accurately.   Mosbacher, one of four Texans named to the Bush Cabinet, has abackground very similar to the new president. Both were born towealthy Northeast families and went to Texas after World War II tomake their fortunes in the oil business.   Mosbacher proved to be more successful than Bush, amassing a networth reportedly topping $200 million as the head of MosbacherEnergy Co. of Houston, an energy development company with leasesalong the Gulf Coast from Texas to Alabama and in the Rocky Montains.   Mosbacher, whose fortune makes him the wealthiest member of theincoming Cabinet, cuts a dashing figure in a generally staid groupof Bush appointees.   He is an accomplished sailor who has won several internationalyachting championships and his third wife, Georgette, is a formermodel who has already made a big splash on the Washington socialscene.   Bush and Mosbacher became friends in the early 1960s withMosbacher often serving as a fund raiser for Bush's politicalefforts. Mosbacher was chief fund raiser for Bush's 1980 and 1988presidential campaigns and performed the same job for PresidentFord's 1976 campaign.   Mosbacher and Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III andTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady became known as the ``Big Three''during Bush's presidential bid last year, the three senior campaignadvisers to whom Bush turned most often for advice.   Because Mosbacher is one of Bush's oldest friends, many expectMosbacher to play a more influential role in setting economic policythan previous Commerce secretaries.   In announcing the nomination last month, Bush said that Mosbacherwould bring his ``tremendous energies to promoting U.S. exportsabroad.''   While administration of U.S. trade policy is considered thedepartment's most vital role, especially in an era of record tradedeficits, the far-flung agency also is home to the Census Bureau,the National Weather Service and the Bureau of Economic Analysis,which produces many of the government's statistical reports.   It is in the trade area, however, where Mosbacher will likelydevote most of his energies. While the trade deficit has improvedafter hitting an all-time high of $170.1 billion in 1987, manyeconomists fear the improvement is in danger of stalling out unlessthe new administration proves more successful than the Reaganadministration in removing foreign barriers to U.S. products.   The United States is currently fighting a ban imposed by the12-nation European Community on American beef treated with hormones.The Reagan administration on Jan. 1 began implementing $100 millionin trade sanctions against European products in retaliation for theEuropean decision to ban hormone-treated beef.</TEXT></DOC>
