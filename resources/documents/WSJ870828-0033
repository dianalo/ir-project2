The agency issued a warning to Gary Strobel, a researcher at Montana State University, and said he must have a &quot;responsible&quot; co-sponsor for any research application made to the EPA in the next year. Mr. Strobel in June treated American elm trees with a genetically altered strain of the bacteria pseudomonas syrinage, in an experimental attempt to retard Dutch elm disease. Although the scientist violated federal procedures, officials of the Agriculture Department and the EPA have agreed with Mr. Strobel that the mutated bacteria probably is harmless.    But those supporting stricter controls on such experiments say any genetically altered compound is potentially dangerous, especially when released into the environment. Jeremy Rifkin, of the Foundation on Economic Trends, and an outspoken critic of genetic engineering, termed the EPA decision &quot;inadequate and pathetic.&quot;    &quot;This is going to send a clear signal to scientists around the country that they can violate federal regulations,&quot; Mr. Rifkin said. He said his organization has petitioned the government to bar Mr. Strobel from receiving federal funds.    Jack Moore, EPA assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances, said the agency couldn't, under federal laws, impose a stricter sanction on a first offense. Asked if the ruling would be seen as a liberating precedent for other scientists, he said, &quot;I hope not.&quot;    Mr. Strobel still faces an internal hearing today at the university, where a committee has recommended destroying the trees involved in the experiment. The National Institutes of Health and the Department of Agriculture also plan to investigate whether the university violated federal regulations, and could move to cut off its federal funds.    Mr. Strobel has in the past described his actions as civil disobedience intended to challenge restrictive regulations, but yesterday he backed off this assertion. Mr. Strobel said he'd gotten mixed signals from federal regulators about the necessary authorization for the experiment. He said he used his own money for the test to avoid implicating the university and that his experiment was safe.    &quot;I'm not a harebrained, half-wit individual that's a loose cannon on the deck,&quot; Mr. Strobel said. </TEXT></DOC>
