The maker of paper and lumber said the business includes three mills and a converting plant that annually produce 225,000 tons of recycled paperboard and converted products. Annual sales are about $100 million.    Mead said the business is profitable but doesn't fit its long-term strategy of focusing on high-growth areas such as its paper and coated paperboard businesses. Mead said the sale won't have a significant impact on earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
