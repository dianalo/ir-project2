Individual gains of $1 million or so were common, with some windfalls topping 10 times that much.    October changed it all when the stock market crashed, erasing much of the earlier increase in the value of such options, which confer the right to buy shares at a specified price sometime in the future. Now, amid heightened uncertainty about the market's course, many executives and compensation planners believe the era of sure-fire options winners is over.    But if companies can't guarantee that option holders will have a chance to sell high, they can increase the probability that they'll be able to buy low. As a consequence, companies and their planners, rather than dropping options as a key part of executive compensation, are seizing on variations and alternatives.    Here are some of the things many companies are considering as they wrap up next year's compensation packages:    CANCEL AND REISSUE   In April, Businessland Inc.'s stock hit a high of $18.25. Come October, it plunged to $6.75, and with it plunged some of the hope employees had of profiting handsomely on their Businessland stock options. So the company decided to make things easier. It gave employees a choice of either keeping the high-priced options they had or canceling them and taking new ones at the current stock price. The offer was good only for options issued in 1987.    &quot;If you were an employee, wouldn't you rather have an option at $6.75 than at $18.25?&quot; asks Suzanne Crocker, Businessland's vice president for corporate communications. (One drawback of such plans, though, is that recipients must begin a new waiting period before the reissued options can be exercised.)    Unlike many other companies, which reserve stock options for senior executives, Businessland offers them to a wide range of managers and professionals, and even to administrative assistants. &quot;Options are given as incentives and rewards,&quot; says Ms. Crocker. When their price begins to exceed the underlying price of the stock, she adds, &quot;they're no longer such a great incentive.&quot;    High-technology companies in particular have followed this cancel-and-reissue route in the wake of the crash, because stock options often make up a large part of compensation in these typically start-up businesses. It is common for start-ups, which usually pay below-market salaries, to offer executives potentially lucrative option packages to lure them from bigger companies. When the market dropped, such companies &quot;had no choice&quot; but to cancel and reissue options, says Roy Brant, president of People Performance, a Los Altos, Calif., consulting firm. &quot;They lost the golden handcuffs.&quot;    ISSUE RESTRICTED STOCK   In the weeks after the crash, Michael Emig, a principal at the New York-based consulting firm Wyatt Cos., was busy fielding questions from concerned companies. &quot;Every one of them,&quot; he recalls, &quot;said, 'Do you have anything better than stock options?'&quot; Mr. Emig's recommendation: restricted stock.    Restricted stock differs from stock options in that it's an outright grant of actual shares. But there are strings attached. To get the full award, the recipient usually must achieve some performance objectives, such as meeting targets for return on equity or return on investments.    Like options, restricted stock ties the executives' interests to those of the company. However, the size of the award doesn't depend solely on appreciation. Once the conditions are met, the entire value of the stock is a gain for the executive. Thus, planners explain, restricted stock can provide a strong incentive in an uncertain market.    GIVE CASH   Right after the crash, many companies began to consider moving away from stock-based incentives to plans that accrue cash each year. &quot;People are becoming insecure,&quot; says Lance Berger, executive vice president of Hay Group Inc., a Philadelphia-based consulting firm. &quot;Now they want more fixed compensation. They want to opt for more security and less risk.&quot;    The cash could be used for long-term bonus plans that, like restricted stock, would be tied to performance objectives. Or it could be used to raise base pay -- a possibility that Mr. Berger cautions against. In an uncertain economic situation, he notes, &quot;the worst thing to do is to increase fixed costs.&quot;    ISSUE MORE OPTIONS   While the rising stock market was a boon to executives who held options that had been granted earlier, it was detrimental to those receiving more recent, higher-priced options. The reason is that a stock's price would have to rise even higher for the latecomers to benefit substantially.    Therefore, some companies are considering granting larger numbers of low-priced options to increase the potential for gain in the future.    However, warns Wyatt's Mr. Emig, the practice may anger shareholders: &quot;If you load up executives with options, it raises the question of what (they) are in this for -- to manage the company or get rich. Shareholders don't like to see executives getting something more advantageous than the shareholders themselves do.&quot;    STAND PAT   Some companies are just sitting tight with regard to options programs.    &quot;We're not too concerned with the market,&quot; says Frederick K. Hahn, manager of executive compensation at Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. &quot;This is a 10-year plan.&quot;    Because many large companies make annual stock-option grants, only the most recent ones were badly affected by the crash. Many older options lost only that portion of value gained during the final months of the overheated rising market.    Goodyear's stock, for example, leaped from a low of about $42 in January to a high of $76.50 in August when Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, made an abortive takeover run at the company. In October, the stock plunged to $35, but it has since recovered. It closed yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $61.75.    Thus, says Mr. Hahn, only one of the company's eight active option grants is &quot;under water&quot; -- that is, has an exercise price greater than the stock price.    As for canceling and reissuing the higher-priced options, he says the company never considered it. &quot;We don't think that's the way to go,&quot; he says. &quot;That's not fair to shareholders. They can't cash in and get a lower price&quot; on their stock.    ---                   Widespread Options   Percentage of companies with stock-option plans in 1986,broken down by type of business.
