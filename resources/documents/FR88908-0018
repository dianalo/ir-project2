The agreement settles charges by the Federal TradeCommission that the NYSCA violated section 5 of the Federal Trade CommissionAct by conspiring to increase the price paid by Group Health Incorporated,a third-party payer operating in New York State, for chiropractic servicesby first negotiating for higher prices, and then, when the negotiationsfailed, organizing a boycott by its members in order to force Group HealthIncorporated to increase its payments for chiropractic services.The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixtydays for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments receivedduring this period will become part of the public record. After sixty days,the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments receivedand will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make finalthe agreement's proposed order.The ComplaintOn September 9, 1987, the Commission issued a complaint charging that theNew York State Chiropractic Association had organized its members to coercehigher payments for chiropractic services from Group Health Incorporated(``GHI'').According to the complaint, GHI provides health care coverage through aparticipating provider system. Under this system, GHI and providers enterinto agreements under which the provider agrees to provide care to personscovered by GHI, and GHI agrees to pay the provider directly for that care.GHI depends on having a sufficient number of participating providers inorder to deliver care to persons with GHI coverage.The complaint alleges that, in 1984, the NYSCA agreed with some of itsmembers, and that some of its members agreed among themselves, to act asa united front to coerce an increase in payments to chiropractors. As partof this agreement, the NYSCA attempted to negotiate higher payments fromGHI. In December of 1984, according to the complaint, the NYSCA threatenedGHI that unless it raised its payments to chiropractors, the NYSCA's memberswould engage in concerted action against GHI. In May of 1985, after GHIrefused to meet the NYSCA's terms, the NYSCA began soliciting its membersto refuse concertedly to provide services to GHI as participating providers.In May and June of that year, the NYSCA delivered several hundred lettersto GHI on behalf of its members who were resigning from participation inGHI. In addition, many of the NYSCA's members sent resignation lettersdirectly to GHI. Shortly thereafter, GHI changed its coverage of chiropracticservices, and subsequently increased its compensation for particular chiropracticserivces, as the NYSCA had demanded.The complaint alleges that these actions have had, or have the tendencyand capacity to have, the following effects, among others:A. Restraining price and service competition among chiropractors in theState of New York.B. Increasing the prices that chiropractors in the State of New York arepaid for their services.C. Depriving GHI and its insureds of the benefits of competition amongchiropractors in the State of New York.The Proposed Consent OrderThe proposed order would prohibit the NYSCA from entering into or implementingany agreement or understanding among its members to deal with any third-partypayer on collectively determined terms. Examples of the conduct that wouldbe prohibited by this order are: (1) Negotiating on behalf of NYSCA memberswith third-party payers, and (2) communicating to third-party payers thatNYSCA members will refuse to enter into an agreement if any term of thatagreement is unacceptable to the NYSCA. This provision of the order wouldallow the NYSCA or its members to provide information to third-party payers,as long as providing the information were not part of an agreement to dealon collectively determined terms.The proposed order also contains a ``fencing-in'' provision that wouldprohibit the NYSCA, for a period of eight years, from providing adviceto any member on the desirability or appropriateness of any participationagreement or of any term of any participation agreement. This provisionincludes a prohibition on commenting on the desirability or appropriatenessof any participation agreement, or term of a participation agreement, andon advising any member to refuse to enter into, or withdraw from, any participationagreement. This provision of the order, however, would allow the NYSCAto provide information to its members about the terms of a participationagreement.Under the proposed order, the NYSCA would be required to distribute a copyof the order to each of its members, to publish this order in an issueof its newsletter, and, for a period of five years, to provide each newmember of the NYSCA with a copy of the order. The order also would requirethe NYSCA to file compliance reports with the Commission ninety days afterservice of the order, annually for a period of five years, and at suchother times as the Commission may require. In addition, the NYSCA wouldbe required for a period of five years to make certain records availableto the Commission upon reasonable notice. The NYSCA would also be requiredto notify the Commission prior to any proposed change to its structure,such as dissolution, which may affect compliance with the order.The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposedorder, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretationof the agreement and proposed order or to modify its terms in any way.The proposed consent order has been entered into for settlement purposesonly and does not constitute an admission by the NYSCA that the law hasbeen violated as alleged in the complaint.<ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
