The policy change, which federal sources indicate could be announced as early as tomorrow, will be aimed at reducing the threat of deportation, a constant source of fear among many spouses and children of amnesty candidates. But the measure is expected to stop short of providing blanket protection for families and probably won't benefit spouses who aren't currently eligible for legalization.    Under the new expected policy, children won't be deported if both parents, or a single parent, are eligible for legalization. But officials indicate spouses who aren't eligible can't receive the more lenient treatment.    Immigration officials declined to disclose fully the nature of the planned announcement. But officials acknowledged that INS representatives have been meeting frequently for the past week or so with Justice Department officials, an indication that details of such a policy change were being worked out.    Illustrative of the human drama is the case of 12-year-old Noel Flores Arias of El Salvador. A plea is scheduled to be entered this morning in Baltimore to help determine whether Noel, who isn't eligible for legalization, can remain with his parents.    The Immigration Reform and Control Act, which took effect Nov. 6, 1986, requires applicants for legalization to prove they had been residing illegally in the U.S. before Jan. 1, 1982. But members of an applicant's immediate family who arrived illegally after that date face the risk of being deported. As a result, many prospective applicants haven't come forward.    In the greater Los Angeles area, for example, an estimated 750,000 people are believed to be eligible for amnesty. But as of early this month, about 341,000 had applied for legalization, according to the INS district director's office. The fear of being separated from other family members is &quot;the overwhelming reason why people aren't stepping out,&quot; said Dan Verches, vice chairman of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, a Los Angeles community group.    &quot;Many come for advice,&quot; Mr. Verches said, &quot;and after we tell them what the requirements are, such as listing family members, they get discouraged and leave. They say they will think about it, but we don't see them again.&quot;    Until now, the law has required applicants to list the names of all immediate family members, including those who don't qualify for amnesty. So far, each family case has been resolved individually by INS district directors, who have been expected to base their decision on what the agency calls &quot;humanitarian&quot; grounds, a concept that hasn't been tested or defined.    Moreover, INS officials have contended that information collected on family members is being treated as confidential. They have repeatedly said that the information hasn't been used for enforcement purposes.    But many critics of the law and the way it has been administered aren't convinced. &quot;Given the past history of INS, I can't blame people for having fear,&quot; said Mary Ann Rodriguez, legislative assistant to Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), who recently introduced a resolution calling for INS to refrain from deporting immediate family members.    But the expected policy change may not go far enough to suit some critics and solve the family unity problems of Maria of Mexico or Julia from El Salvador. Deportation is something that weighs heavily on the mind of Maria, a 31-year-old Mexican mother in Houston who declined to give her last name for fear of deportation. Her husband qualifies for amnesty and her three youngest children are citizens by U.S. birth. But she and her seven-year-old son came in September 1982, about nine months after the amnesty cutoff date. Though her oldest child was born in Mexico, the bilingual first-grader insists the U.S. is now &quot;his country.&quot;    Said Maria in Spanish: &quot;I give thanks to the people here who have given us the opportunity to stay here.&quot; If the INS discovers her illegal status and orders her back to Mexico, she won't return alone but with her entire family of Mexicans and Americans, she said.    The case of Julia from El Salvador is more complex. She said she fled war rather than poverty. She had worked as a maid at a motel in Virginia for four years until she was apprehended by INS agents earlier this month. Her attorney, Anya Zykes, asked that the woman's last name not be used because of fear of reprisal. Julia said her father and brother had been executed in El Salvador before she fled to this country to join her husband, a maintenance man at the motel.    Her husband came to the U.S. before the amnesty cutoff date and is eligible for legalization. But she arrived later and thus isn't eligible. She and her 18-month-old daughter, who was born in the U.S., could be deported to El Salvador.    &quot;It isn't the losing of my job that I worry about,&quot; Julia said in Spanish. &quot;It's my family. It hurts me to think that I could be separated from my husband.&quot;    A hearing by the INS to determine her case has been scheduled for November. Meanwhile, her attorney, Ms. Zykes, is hoping to stall by litigating until Julia's husband can get his legal residency. &quot;Then he can apply for her,&quot; Ms. Zykes said.    If INS determines that Julia's case doesn't qualify on humanitarian grounds, Ms. Zykes said she will file for political asylum for her client. The backlog for that process is so large that the client would probably get to stay in the U.S. for at least three years.    And even if the INS deports her, Julia said she has already decided to pay a smuggler anywhere from $600 to $2,000 to bring her back to the U.S. &quot;I'll come back again,&quot; she vowed. &quot;I think everyone would want to do the same thing for the sake of family.&quot;    ---   Dianna Solis in Houston contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
