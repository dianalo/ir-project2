German coal can be used to manufacture itand manufacturing processes are available in West Germany for this purpose.By using methanol as alternative fuel to imported coal or natural gas,one achieves diversification of energy imports and a displacement ofimports to energy sources from other, less critical, areas. After testrig experiments and tests of the methanol fuel and the vehicles drivenby it by the petroleum and vehicle industries, a three year practicaltest of the petrol/methanol mixed fuel M15 was started in 1979 as a jointdemonstration project, by the Ministry of Research and Technology andindustrial firms. The target was to test the alternative fuel M15 andthe supply infrastructure in a large experiment and to demonstrate thereadiness for use of M15 vehicles to customers. Apart from energy consumptionand emission of exhaust gas, long term behaviour, practicality and technicalreadiness for use of M15 vehicles on the road were determined by technicalinvestigations on vehicles which were done continuously over the wholetime period or at given intervals, and these were continuously controlled.The investigations accompanying practical tests were performed by theBerlin project group and supplement the investigations done at the industrialfirms.</TEXT></DOC>
