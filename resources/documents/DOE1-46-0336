The utility of the patterns for structureelucidation is established by specific deuterium labeling of heme methylsof the terminal base product. On the basis of the know saturation ofring B in this isomer. The methyl resonance of the saturated ring isfound to have strongly attenuated contact shift. Thus, the heme methylcontact shift pattern is diagnostic for the saturated pyrrole in thehigh-spin state. This rationale is then applied to analyze the assignedNMR spectra of the initial and terminal acid sulfmyoglobin products,revealing that the same ring B is saturated in each isomer. In contrast,the heme methyl contact shift pattern in low-spin ferric complexes revealsthat the methyls both on the affected pyrrole and on the trans pyrroleare influenced similarly on sulfmyoglobin formation, precluding the useof this methyl shift pattern as a unique indicator of the site of saturation.Identification of exchangeable proximal histidine resonances for met-aquosulfmyoglobin complexes with shifts similar to that in native myoglobindictates inconsequential axial alterations in the sulfmyoglobins, whilelocation of downfield meso proton resonances analogous to those of thenative protein demonstrates the retention of the coordinate water inthe active site of met-sulfmyoglobin.</TEXT></DOC>
