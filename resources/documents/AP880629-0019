The state Supreme Court's Appellate Division voted 5-0 to vacatethe jail sentence Justice Stephen Crane imposed on Goetz lastOctober for third-degree criminal possession of a weapon.   The appeals court let stand the $5,000 fine, the 280 hours ofcommunity service, the five years' probation and the psychiatriccounseling that Crane ordered for Goetz.   Goetz, a 40-year-old electronics specialist, was acquitted lastJune 16 of all but the gun charge in the shooting of fourteen-agers in a subway in Lower Manhattan on Dec. 22, 1984. He saidhe shot them after they tried to rob him. The young men claimedthey were just panhandling money.   Goetz did not return telephone calls.   One of Goetz's lawyers, Mark Baker, said he was ``partlypleased'' by the decision. He said he was happy that the courtfound the sentence illegal but he said he planned to appeal otherissues in the case to the Court of Appeals, the state's highesttribunal.   Both the prosecution and the defense contended that thepunishment was illegal and that Goetz should have been sentenced toa year in jail.   The defense wanted a year's sentence because that would havemade Goetz eligible for release after two months. Because of aquirk in the law, a six-month sentence would have meant he was noteligible for parole until four months had been served.   The prosecution also argued that the law mandated a minimumsentence of one year.   In their opinion, the judges wrote that Crane could have imposeda shorter legal sentence if he had explained why the sentencerequired by law ``would be unduly harsh.''   ``Since the court expressly stated on the record that a definiteone-year term or an indeterminate term would not be unduly harsh,the split sentence was unauthorized and illegal,'' the judges saidin an unsigned three-page opinion.</TEXT></DOC>
