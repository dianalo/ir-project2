De Michelis, president of the EC's Council of Ministers, madethe statement after the first meeting of the so-called troika ofEuropean foreign ministers with Israel's new foreign minister,David Levy of the right-wing Likud bloc.   The meeting came as European leaders are putting increasingpressure on Israel to move toward peace with Palestinians, and asIsrael is seeking wider trade cooperation from Europe.   De Michelis said the visiting Europeans foreign ministers, whoincluded Jacques F. Poos of Luxembourg and Gerard Collins ofIreland, expressed to Israeli leaders their concerns about thesituation in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   The Italian official told a news conference that the EC waswilling to support any initiative toward Middle East peace even ifit does not conform to one adopted by European leaders at a summitlast month.   The summit in Dublin recommended an international peaceconference on the Middle East, including representatives from thePalestine Liberation Organization. Israel views the PLO as aterrorist organization and rejects the idea of an internationalconference.   ``We're open to examine all possibilities offered by allparties, of course also by the Israeli government,'' De Michelissaid after the meeting.   He said the EC would take into consideration Israel's views ofthe PLO but that Israel would have to find another ``realPalestinian interlocutor.''   He also said, however, that European leaders were worried thatMiddle East tensions could deteriorate dangerously unless stepswere taken quickly toward peace.   When asked whether Israel would be granted crucial economicconcessions as the 12-nation EC moved toward a single market in1992, De Michelis said that would depend on progress toward peace.   ``If the peace process continues, there will be a jump in thequality of economic cooperation in the entire region, and of courseIsrael has a special place in that,'' he said.   ``But,'' he added, ``if there is a deterioration, economic andsocial cooperation will become more and more difficult.''   De Michelis said the EC leaders were concerned that a wave ofSoviet Jews immigrating to Israel could adversely effect the 1.7million Palestinians in the occupied territories.   Levy noted that Europe does not face the dangers that Israeldoes in dealing with the Palestinians and its Arab neighbors.   The visit by the three foreign ministers was the first by ECleaders to Israel since Prime Minister Yizthak Shamir formed aright-wing government in June led by his Likud bloc.   The three ministers are to meet Tuesday with Shamir beforetraveling to Tunis for talks with the Arab League.</TEXT></DOC>
