 Courts and otherfederal courts cooperated to install the system less than two weeks afterEastern filed its case March 9 at the U.S.andP;  Bankruptcy Court, SouthernDistrict of New York.andM;Normally a court that handles cases as big as this one would have a muchlarger, minicomputer-based system, said Dennis Morey, program manager of theAdministrative Office's Federal Court Automation Program (Fedcap).andM;However, Eastern filed for protection before the New York court was scheduledto receive its system, so the court got an 80386 system for just that case.andO;&quot;They were in a panic on this,&quot; he said.andM;Eastern is seeking legal protection from its 1.75 million creditors underChapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, said Kathleen Farrell, thebankruptcy court's chief deputy clerk.andP;  In less than three weeks, the partiesproduced a docket with more than 70 filings and decisions, she said.andM;Court employees installed the system and trained the bankruptcy court usersin a little more than a week.andP;  Normally the process takes two months or more,Morey said.andM;Within nine to 12 months, the Administrative Office will install aminicomputer-based system in New York and train the employees to use it forother types of bankruptcy cases, Morey said.andM;A more typical court system would have 20 to 80 terminals linked to a UnisysCorp. 5000/80 or /90 minicomputer, he said.andM;The initial version of the New York court's system connects six Unisys UVT1224 terminals to the Compaq 386/25 through three six-port expansion boardsfrom Bell Technologies, Fremont, Calif.andP;  The U.S.andP;  Courts office plans toconnect three more terminals soon, Morey said.andM;Also attached to the system is a 2,400-bit/sec modem, a Hewlett-PackardLaserJet II printer and a Bell Technologies 60M tape cartridge backup system.andM;The Compaq has a 300M hard disk and uses Version 3.0 of the UNIX System Voperating system software from Bell Technologies.andM;Gary Bockweg, a senior court analyst at the Federal Judicial Center (FJC),the Administrative Office's sister agency, said the 386 system offersdramatic savings over the cost of a Unisys system.andP;  He said a court couldhave a full 80386-based, 20-terminal system for about $35,000, including thecomputer, terminals, software and the necessary wiring and other sitepreparation.andM;A similar setup built around a Unisys mini probably would cost three to fourtimes as much, including the necessary air conditioning, he said.andM;Installing the New York court's 386 system was made easier because theAdministrative Office had experience installing similar systems at 17 otherfederal courts, Morey said.andP;  Although only three of those courts have a386-based system and none of these is a bankruptcy court, the 386 systems use&quot;exactly the same software as on the minicomputer,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;One of theadvantages of UNIX is that it gives us vendor-independence.&quot;andM;Benchmark testing by the FJC found the 386 performed well with up to 12simultaneous, active users, Bockweg said.andP;  Because experience with thedocketing system shows that only about half those hooked up are active users,a 25-MHz 386 probably could support up to 24 users, he said.andM;&quot;All of our technical folks were amazed at the performance of that 386,&quot; hesaid.andM;The applications software is a customized version of the Integrated CaseManagement System software written by FJC programmers using C and the UnifyDBMS database from Unify Corp., Sacramento, Calif.andM;Staff members from the Administrative Office and two court-run trainingcenters work with clerks from a court to learn that court's unique proceduresand prepare a customized version of the common-core software in severalweeks, Morey said.andM;Because of the time pressure from the Eastern case, three employees from theAdministrative Office's training center at the Western District of Texascourt in San Antonio flew to New York to help that court customize thesoftware.andP;  At the same time, three people from the bankruptcy court flew toSan Antonio for abbreviated training focusing only on Chapter 11 filings.andM;Core software works well, he said, because all courts have a base of similarfunctions.andP;  Fedcap plans call for automated docketing systems at 94bankruptcy courts, 94 district courts and 13 appeals courts, Morey said.andM;Because the 386 systems have worked so well, court officials hope to issue arequest for proposals for hundreds more 80386 computers, Morey said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
