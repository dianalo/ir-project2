In a day of testimony thick with political rhetoric overtrade and jobs, McDonnell Douglas Executive Vice PresidentJohn Wolf told a subcommittee of the Joint Economic Committeethat the $10 billion cost estimate for a new jetliner programcited by rival Boeing Co. &quot;is frankly preposterous.&quot; He alsomaintained that the venture with the Taiwan concern will notrequire subsidies at all.</LP><TEXT>   An executive for Seattle-based Boeing, which hasrecommended U.S. government action to prevent foreignsubsidies for its rival McDonnell Douglas, told thesubcommittee that such an alliance would require about $10billion to begin producing the proposed long-range MD-12wide-body airliners -- more than double the $4 billion to $5billion McDonnell Douglas has estimated.   Foreign aircraft subsidies already are a volatile issuebecause U.S. officials are locked in an eight-year stand-offover alleged unfair subsidies from the four European nationsinvolved in the Airbus Industrie consortium, the world'ssecond-largest jet manufacturer.   The McDonnell Douglas plan calls for Taiwan Aerospace toput up $2 billion for a 40% share of the St. Louis company'sDouglas Aircraft Co. airliner operations, based in LongBeach, Calif. Another 9% could be sold to other Asian orEuropean partners, bringing the total capital raised to about$2.5 billion. McDonnell Douglas would retain majoritycontrol. Foreign partners would build substantial parts ofthe aircraft in Douglas-owned plants in their countries.   During his testimony and in an earlier interview, Mr. Wolfsaid at least $1.5 billion of the total Taiwan Aerospaceinvestment would be used to pay down long-term debt, bracingMcDonnell Douglas's balance sheet and allowing it to turn tolenders to help finance the project. He said the venture alsowould draw on revenue from sales of other aircraft models,and it would lease manufacturing sites to restrain costs.   For McDonnell Douglas, which relies on sales of two smalland medium-sized models of jetliners, survival in thecommercial business depends on its ability to expand itsproduct line. The MD-12 would compete against the popularBoeing 747 jumbo jets and also let McDonnell Douglas expandits &quot;family&quot; of jets with similar operating features.   Mr. Wolf said that a failure by his company to close thetransaction or a similar one could endanger 29,000 U.S. jobs.&quot;What we're really going for is survival,&quot; he said,explaining that the company will have no choice but to slowlywithdraw from the jetliner-making business if it can't addmore jet models.   The McDonnell Douglas plan touches a nerve in some tradeand labor circles, where it has been depicted as shippingprecious jobs and valued technology overseas. Companyofficials said there isn't any risk of exporting technology,and noted that co-production contracts in foreign countriesare common in the jet industry.   In his testimony, in fact, Mr. Wolf said that an agreementBoeing has for Japanese companies to have 20% participationin Boeing's new 777 wide-body jetliner actually is a worsedeal for American industry because it could help create along-term U.S. manufacturing rival in Japan.   Boeing disagrees that its 777 arrangement will stimulatecreation of a Japanese airliner industry.   Mr. Wolf previously has said he believes Boeing is tryingto saddle the McDonnell Douglas deal with regulations so thatit will die. But some committee members questioned the Taiwanplan.   &quot;The proposed sale is symptomatic of a much largerproblem,&quot; said Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.), the subcommiteechairman. He said he believes that foreign interests havetargeted the U.S. commerical aircraft industry, whichannually generates $100 billion in sales and produces nearlya $30 billion trade surplus.   In their separate testimonies, Mr. Wolf and Boeing VicePresident Larry Clarkson agreed that McDonnell Douglaswouldn't have the problems it does today without theexistence of subsidies at Airbus. That is a suggestionchallenged by Airbus, which maintains that McDonnellDouglas's problems evolved long before the consortium offeredjets that compete with the MD-80 and MD-11.</TEXT></DOC>
