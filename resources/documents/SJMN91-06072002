Spokane reps even traveled to hear him in San Jose, and Grinwent to Spokane to conduct some audition rehearsals.;    But now, amid greatsighs of relief by local symphony-watchers, Spokane has named another Sovietemigre -- Vakhtang Jordania -- as its music director. So Grin remains in therunning for San Jose -- at least until the next offer pops up on his faxmachine.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GRIN WON'T BE GOING TO SPOKANESOVIET STILL IN S.J. SYMPHONY RACE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Classical Music  </MEMO><TEXT>     San Jose already has lost candidate John Mauceri, another preseasonfavorite, at least in this critic's view, until his cancellation andwithdrawal last month.;    BERKELEY MINIMALIST composer John Adams' upcomingopera may be too political for its own good. Even with the Persian Gulf warnow over, the work is being treated with extreme caution and special securitymeasures.;    &quot;The Death of Klinghoffer&quot; is based on the 1985 Palestinianterrorist attack on the Mediterranean cruise ship Achille Lauro, whichresulted in the death of one passenger, an escape by air, an interception byU.S. jets, and a trial in Italy in which the terrorists were found guilty.;   The opus may prove as politically sensitive as classics of the genre such as&quot;The Marriage of Figaro,&quot; &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and &quot;Un ballo in maschera.&quot;;    Nextweek's world premiere in Brussels, Belgium, of this operatic collaborationbetween composer Adams and stage director Peter Sellars is being orchestratedwith a news brownout. There are no interviews, and, until two weeks before theMarch 19 opening, there were no press releases, either.;    The work, comingto the San Francisco Opera in the fall of 1992, opens in the Monnaie OperaHouse with Adams in attendance.;    The unsettled world situation is also afactor in the cancellation of upcoming tours to Western Europe by the New YorkPhilharmonic under Zubin Mehta and the St. Louis Symphony under LeonardSlatkin. The Philharmonic was to make an Easter tour, while the St. Louisorchestra was to have gone in February.;    THE COMPUTER-MUSIC studio atStanford University has aroused controversy over a concert coming Thursdaynight to Dinkelspiel Auditorium, because Norwegian composer Per Landa insistson passing out earplugs for those who will be hearing his high-volume music.;   &quot;That (high a sound level) is utterly against my philosophy, but I can't betyrannical,&quot; says studio director John Chowning. The concert also featurescomposers from Argentina and Stanford.;    On a more harmonious note, Chowningis working to bring over from the USSR the legendary Leon Theremin, whoinvented one of the first electronic instruments (named the theremin) around1924. Chowning met him on his recent Soviet visit and found him spry andactive at 95, eager to return to the United States, where he had lived for atime until 1938. Theremin once met with Lenin himself to demonstrate hisinstrument and apparently left the Red leader impressed with his revolutionarydevice.;    THE DEATH of New York composer Elie Siegmeister at 82 deprives themusic world of a live-wire author, raconteur, educator, and prolific composeron American themes. He studied abroad with Nadia Boulanger and had his musicplayed by Arturo Toscanini, who was never known to be a champion of Americanmusic. Five seasons ago the San Jose Symphony, under George Cleve, playedSiegmeister's &quot;Ozark Set.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Paul Hertelendy column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910312  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  601  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday March 12, 199100072002,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
