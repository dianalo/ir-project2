Then he'll jump aboard his Air Force jet and rush home havingabout 24 hours to shift gears, pack fresh laundry and head for theMiddle East to push a plan for Arab-Israeli negotiations thatneither side is excited about.   Shultz will pause patiently at NATO headquarters on Tuesday togive the West Europeans a blow-by-blow account of his talks withGeneral Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze.   He considers these briefings critical to the cohesion of theWest European alliance. It's also Shultz' way of making sure Moscowknows that the United States is on guard against any attempt todivide the allies.   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization will get a bigger andmore publicized boost on March 2.   President Reagan will hold a summit meeting with the 15 NATOWest European and Canadian leaders. The aim is to reinforce theidea that the trans-Atlantic alliance formed after World War IIremains the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy.   Hundreds of reporters, photographers and television cameras willmake sure the point is not lost on American and West Europeanaudiences.   And yet, high-powered diplomacy and public relations aside,maintaining American unity with Western Europe in a nuclear-nervousera is not always easy.   The Dutch and the Belgians did not want U.S. intermediate-rangenuclear weapons on their soil. The Danes opposed having the rocketsanywhere in Western Europe. Norway and Spain are self-declarednuclear-free zones. France, with its own nuclear force, does nottake part in various NATO deliberations.   West Germany in 1979 readily accepted the Pershing 2 and cruisemissiles that now will be withdrawn over three years. Butsignificant segments of the West German electorate and politicalspectrum wanted the United States to move on to negotiations to cutback battlefield nuclear weapons.   NATO decided in 1983 to scrap 1,400 of the oldest nuclear armsin Western Europe. But many of the American weapons that remain andare below the 315-mile intermediate range will be replaced withnewer ones.   ``No alliance allows its forces to defend itself ... withweapons from yesteryear,'' Assistant Secretary of State RozanneRidgway said Wednesday. ``Modernization is an ongoing process. Weare not prepared to defend Europe with weapons from the 1890s.''   Large numbers of the new arms would be deployed in West Germany.   She said the West German government supported the program andwas not pushing for negotiations to reduce the current tacticalarsenals.   ``There is no move for the removal of the tactical nuclearweapons from Europe,'' the U.S. official said.   Actually, the West Germans would have preferred giving toppriority to negotiating a reduction in tactical nuclear weapons nowthat the United States and the Soviet Union have signed a treaty toscrap 2,700 intermediate-range rockets.   But Shultz and the 15 Western foreign ministers resolved at aNATO meeting last year in Reykjavik, Iceland, to place three otheritems on the top of the agenda: a strategic nuclear weaponscutback, a ban on chemical weapons and eliminating the WarsawPact's edge in ground forces.   Now that the West Germans have backed off, the Reaganadministration can concentrate on still another problem: the futureof U.S. bases in Western Europe.   While Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has dropped alldiscussion of pulling Greece out of NATO, he has not withdrawn histhreats to close U.S. military bases on Greek soil. PortuguesePrime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva has threatened to scrap a treatythat allows American use of a base in the Azores Islands. And theUnited States is still looking for a home for the 72 F16fighter-bombers Spain is ordering out of the Torrejon base nearMadrid.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid is head of the AP's StateDepartment staff.</TEXT></DOC>
