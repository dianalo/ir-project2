The elevator operators' proposal wasto investigate the possibility of obtaining energy from waste by burningthe grain wastes in one of the power plant's boilers. The rationale topursue the concept of co-combusting grain wastes with regular stationfuel is the fuel savings that may be possible. With a heating value ofabout 14.9 MJ/kg, one tonne (1 Mg) of grain wastes could displace 0.94tonne of lignite with a heating value of 15.9 MJ/kg, which is normallyfired in two of the power plant's units. As an example, if 40,000 Mgof grain wastes could be burned annually, this would displace approximately37,600 Mg of lignite. Grain wastes, with a true cost (i.e. cost of truckingfrom grain elevators to the station) of about $10/Mg would be displacinglignite at a cost ranging form $33-$39/Mg, resulting in a projected annualbenefit ranging from approximately $840,000 to $1.1 million. This paperdescribes the activities undertaken to date to investigate the potentialuse of this novel product as a supplemental fuel for the power plant.2 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
