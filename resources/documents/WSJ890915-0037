Nervousness about the prospects for junk bonds in light of a cash squeeze at Campeau, a major issuer of high-yield debt, led market players to unload stocks of actual and rumored acquisition targets.    Blue-chip issues fared considerably better than the broad market, as the takeover-related selling had a relatively mild impact on those stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.63 to 2664.89.    By contrast, the number of New York Stock Exchange issues that declined in price reached a four-week high, and losers outnumbered gainers on the Big Board by nearly 3-1, as 1,108 issues fell while only 396 advanced.    Along with the takeover worries, traders cited uncertainty about today's release of several sets of U.S. economic data and the &quot;triple witching hour&quot; expiration of September stock-index futures and options.    &quot;Most institutions have made up their minds that they were going to be out of the market this week, because it was just too volatile and there were too many things going on,&quot; said Jack Baker, head of the equity block trading desk at Shearson Lehman Hutton.    Volume slowed to 149,250,000 shares on the Big Board from 175,330,000 the day before, largely because of a drop in futures-related program trading ahead of the September expirations. Rounds of buy programs related to stock-index arbitrage hit the market twice in the afternoon, but their impact was short-lived.    Among broader averages, the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 2.30 to 343.16, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index skidded 2.35 to 322.38, and the Big Board's Composite Index went down 1.34 to 190.95.    Although market activity has been light all week, traders predict that as many as 100 million shares will change hands on the Big Board at the opening as today's &quot;triple witching&quot; session begins. The heavy trading is generally expected to put additional pressure on prices, but traders and analysts say the economic data are likely to influence the extent of the selling.    Figures on August producer prices and the July trade deficit, along with three reports on the state of the industrial economy, are due today. If they should prove better than expected, Mr. Baker said, buyers will &quot;take up a lot of the slack.&quot;    But Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said the troubles faced by Campeau and others who have used junk bonds to finance acquisitions will continue to undercut the speculative interest that has boosted many stocks in recent months.    &quot;The whole takeover game will never be the same again. A lot of traders and speculators are really having their heads handed to them,&quot; he said. &quot;It's going to put a virtual end to the intensity of the speculation.&quot;    Toronto-based Campeau Wednesday announced widening losses at its Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores units and disclosed further details of its difficulties in meeting debt payments. But market players yesterday didn't distinguish among takeover stocks, as shares involved in already-arranged deals that don't require junk-bond financing fell along with those that are only rumored candidates.    Woolworth, recently named as a possible target for investor Meshulam Riklis, tumbled 3 1/4 to 64 3/4 in active trading. Other rumor stocks finishing high on the active list included Eastman Kodak, which went down 5/8 to 48 1/8 as 1.3 million shares changed hands in composite trading; Upjohn, down 5/8 to 36 3/4; and Valero Energy, down 1 1/2 to 17 1/4.    Circle K, the most active Big Board issue, fell 3/8 to 7 3/8 on 2.2 million shares after suspending its dividend and halting efforts to find a buyer. Warner Communications, which has agreed to be acquired by Time Warner for cash and preferred stock, declined 5/8 to 63 1/4 on 1.4 million shares.    Oil stocks viewed as potential targets retreated after the chief executive officer of British Petroleum's exploration unit denied speculation that BP plans an offer for a U.S. oil company soon. Phillips Petroleum fell 7/8 to 26 5/8 on 1.3 million shares, Unocal lost 1 5/8 to 54 1/2, Burlington Resources was unchanged at 47 1/2, Kerr McGee slipped 1 to 48 3/8, and Amerada Hess slid 1 1/4 to 41 3/4.    Oryx Energy, which agreed to acquire certain oil and gas properties from BP for $1.35 billion, retreated 2 1/4 to 38 7/8. BP fell 1/2 to 60 1/2 after climbing 1 1/8 Wednesday on anticipation of the sale, part of a restructuring of its exploration operations.    Takeover-related losses were especially evident in the airline and hotel groups, both of which had rallied recently on news of acquisitions and asset sales and on expectations that the activity would continue.    The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 25.96 to 1443.28, its sixth loss in the past seven sessions. UAL, the owner of United Airlines, fell 2 3/4 to 280 1/2; United's machinists union called for rejection of a $300-a-share offer from a group that includes management, the airline's pilots union and British Airways. AMR, the owner of American Airlines, plunged 4 1/8 to 77 5/8; Delta Air Lines skidded 2 7/8 to 71 5/8; USAir Group dropped 1 3/8 to 46 5/8; and Southwest Airlines eased 1 1/8 to 26 3/4.    As for hotel and casino issues, Hilton Hotels dropped 2 3/8 to 102 5/8, Holiday fell 1 5/8 to 80, Marriott slipped 3/8 to 38 3/8, Caesars World skidded 1 3/4 to 35, and Ramada lost 3/8 to 14 3/8.    Stocks of major banks and brokerage firms also fell victim to nervousness about the takeover and junk-bond markets. In the banking sector, Citicorp went down 1 1/4 to 30 5/8 on 1.3 million shares, and Bankers Trust New York fell 1 5/8 to 51 7/8; among brokerage issues, Merrill Lynch retreated 3/4 to 32 1/8, Morgan Stanley Group lost 1 1/2 to 76 3/4, and Salomon slid 5/8 to 25 3/4.    Bank of New York dropped 2 1/8 to 50 amid rumors that the company holds a large portfolio of Campeau bonds. The company denied owning any of the bonds but acknowledged having a working-capital loan outstanding to one of Campeau's department-store units.    Precious-metals stocks, a traditional haven for investors in times of uncertainty, outgained all other Dow Jones industry groups. Battle Mountain Gold advanced 1/8 to 14 3/8, Homestake Mining rose 1/4 to 15, and ASA climbed 5/8 to 42.    Other metals stocks that avoided being caught in the market's retreat included Phelps Dodge, which closed unchanged at 67; Asarco, which rose 1/2 to 34 7/8; and Magma Copper, which gained 1/4 to 7 in American Stock Exchange trading. Drexel Burnham Lambert began coverage of the copper producers with buy recommendations, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.    Stocks of generic-drug makers, which some analysts are telling investors to hold onto despite the industry's recent regulatory problems, posted gains. On the Big Board, Par Pharmaceutical went up 1/4 to 5 7/8 and Biocraft Laboratories added 7/8 to 19 1/4; Bolar Pharmaceutical gained 1 5/8 to 19 7/8 and Halsey Drug rose 3/8 to 6 1/8 on the Amex.    Monsanto fell 4 3/4 to 113 3/4. Analysts at a number of firms, including Morgan Stanley, Prudential-Bache Securities and Mabon Nugent, lowered their earnings estimates after the company advised them of a slowdown in sales of its Roundup herbicide.    Hexcel dropped 1 7/8 to 24 7/8. Drexel lowered its estimates of the company's 1989 and 1990 earnings, citing a downbeat presentation at an aerospace conference that the firm sponsored.    AMRE was an exception to the rule among takeover stocks as it advanced 1 1/2 to 9 1/4 after news that three top executives are holding talks about a possible management buy-out.    The American Stock Exchange Index dropped 2.83 to 380.94, its steepest decline since late June. Volume totaled 12,510,000 shares, compared with 15,110,000 Wednesday. There were 184 issues advancing in price, 396 declining and 273 unchanged.    Unicorp American went down 3/4 to 3 3/8. Unicorp Canada withdrew an offer to reorganize the company, which said it plans a liquidation of its real estate portfolio and the suspension of its quarterly dividend. </TEXT></DOC>
