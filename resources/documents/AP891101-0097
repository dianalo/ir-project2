(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge ruled that a fundamentalist couplewho took to heart the Biblical admonition against sparing the rodabused their children by spanking them with a stick and paddle, afamily supporter said today.   The ruling, made in a closed-door juvenile proceeding thatraised the question of how far adults may go in disciplining theirchildren, endorsed social workers' decision to take the youngstersfrom their parents in August.   The parents, Stephen and JoAnn DeCosta of Rumney, still faceassault charges brought separately in a criminal indictment earlierthis year.   Former Gov. Meldrim Thomson, who was called as a characterwitness but never testified, said he learned that District JudgeEdwin Kelly ruled Tuesday that the DeCostas abused their 3-year-olddaughter and 7-year-old son.   Thomson said the judge also ruled the couple abused their otherchildren, a 9-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter.   There was no immediate confirmation of the ruling. The rulingmeans the children will remain in state custody for up to 18 monthsunless the parents regain custody on appeal or the family isreconciled through counseling.   The state brought abuse charges against the parents afterspankings left the children's rear ends red and bruised,authorities said.   Court clerk Phil Tapply confirmed a decision was reached butwould not say what it was.   Andrew McEvoy, the DeCostas' lawyer, declined to comment today,citing a state law that prohibits talking about child abuse orneglect cases.   Mrs. DeCosta, citing the same statute, would not comment.   The family's supporters maintain that the state is unjustlypenalizing the DeCostas because their religious beliefs dictatethat parents should use corporal punishment on their children. Theyalso say the statute barring discussion of the case is harming thefamily by leaving it unable to answer rumors.   Judy Bell, a lawyer for the Division of Children and YouthServices, said earlier that such charges brought by the divisionare ruled either ``founded'' or ``unfounded.'' State officialswould not discuss the decision.</TEXT></DOC>
