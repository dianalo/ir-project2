The main and lobar bronchicould be demonstrated almost without exception in the standard examinationof the thorax. Segmental bronchi were delineated in an average of 81%of the cases (512 image matrix) or 74% (256 image matrix) respectively.The lowest identification rate was seen in the segmental bronchi of themiddle lobe and lingula being 38% (512 image matrix) and 18% (256 imagematrix), respectively. Increase in the identification rate of the segmentalbronchi of the middle lobe and lingula was achieved only after reducingthe slice thickness from 8 mm to 4 mm, the yield being now 87% (512 imagematrix) and 82% (256 image matrix), respectively, whereas the remainingsegmental bronchi could be made to show up almost without exception.The standard parameters are sufficient for routine examination of thebronchial system. If imaging is diagnostically not satisfactory, reducingthe slice thickness yields improved imaging, especially of small bronchi.</TEXT></DOC>
