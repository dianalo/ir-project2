This Notice concludes the Agency's administrativeSpecial Review of the risks and benefits of dinocap which was initiatedin a <T4> Federal Register</T4> notice of January 9, 1985 (50 FR 1119). When the Notice of Preliminary Determination concerning dinocap was publishedon October 29, 1986 (51 FR 39577), supporting documents were made availableto any requesting party. After carefully evaluating the risk/benefit information,the Agency concluded in the Preliminary Determination that the risks posedby the use of dinocap outweighed the benefits of continued registration,unless certain modifications to the terms of registration were made. TheAgency proposed to require closed mixing systems, additional protectiveclothing, application from vehicles with enclosed cabs for some uses, restrictionof use to certified applicators for agricultural uses, and a teratogenicitywarning statement on product labels for agricultural use as well as productsregistered for use in home gardens and home lawns. The Agency's preliminary determinations were submitted to the FIFRA ScientificAdvisory Panel (SAP) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) forreview pursuant to sections 6(b) and 25(d) of FIFRA. Comments were alsosolicited from the registrants and any other interested parties. Afterreviewing all comments, the Agency has determined that the use of dinocapproducts as currently registered will result in risks to mixer/loadersand applicators that are not outweighed by the benefits of the use of dinocap.By making modifications to the terms and conditions of dinocap registrations,as detailed in this Notice, the Agency has determined that the benefitsof the use of dinocap will outweigh the risks of such use. These modificationsare:1. The Agency will require all dinocap labels to bear the statement, ``Useof this product may be hazardous to your health. This product has beendetermined to cause birth defects in laboratory animals.'' 2. The Agency will lower the rate of application of liquid formulationsof dinocap for use on pears to 0.47 lbs./acre. 3. For the use of dinocap as a wettable powder on apples, the Agency willrequire mixer/loaders and applicators to use additional protective clothingand equipment not currently required. When warm weather conditions makethe use of certain protective clothing impractical, applications for thisuse will be from a vehicle with a closed cab. 4. For the use of dinocap as a wettable powder on pears, or as a liquidor wettable powder on grapes and field cucurbits, the Agency will requiremixer/loaders and applicators to use additional protective clothing andequipment not currently required, and will require that they make all applicationsof dinocap for these uses from a vehicle with a closed cab. This Notice is organized into seven units. Unit I is the introduction,describing the chemical background and regulatory history of dinocap, andthe legal basis of the Special Review process. Unit II summarizes the Agency'sanalyses of the risks and benefits of dinocap, as presented in the PreliminaryDetermination (51 FR 39577), and described in greater detail in the TechnicalSupport Document, issued October 14, 1986. Unit II also responds to thecomments of the Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP), U.S. Department of Agriculture(USDA), and Rohm and Haas Company, the registrant and only other commenter,on the Agency's analysis of the risks and benefits of dinocap use. UnitII also contains the Agency's final position on the risks and benefitsof dinocap. Unit III contains the complete text of the comments of theSAP and USDA and discusses their comments as well as comments of Rohm andHass that were not addressed in Unit II. Unit IV describes the Agency'sfinal determinations and the regulatory actions required by this Notice.Unit V describes various procedural matters including procedures for requestinga hearing. Unit VI discusses the public docket for this Special Review.Unit VII is the bibliography. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Introduction </ITAG>A. Chemical Background Dinocap is the common name for a mixture of the cis- and trans-isomersof 2,4-dinitro-6-octylphenol crotonate and 2,6-dinitro-6-octylphenol crotonate;about 85 percent of technical dinocap is composed of these compounds, theremainder being poorly characterized reaction products. Dinocap, a fungicide,is registered to control powdery mildew diseases, and also has limiteduse as a miticide. About 100,000 pounds of active ingredient are appliedannually in the United States. Rohm and Haas is the sole producer of technicaldinocap and markets end-use products containing dinocap; other companiesbuy technical dinocap from Rohm and Haas and formulate it into end-useproducts as well. There are about 80 federally registered products containingdinocap, 20 intrastate products, which have been called in for Federalregistration, and 4 special local needs registrations issued pursuant toFIFRA section 24(c).Apples account for about 92 percent of the annual use of dinocap; applicationis made to apples from early spring to late summer. An estimated 30 percentof the U.S. apple acreage and up to 80 percent of certain varieties aretreated. Dinocap is also applied to other fruits, vegetables, and ornamentalcrops. Its home garden use accounts for less than 1 percent of all dinocapuse. There is negligible greenhouse use.B. Regulatory HistoryOn January 9, 1985, EPA issued a Notice of Initiation of Special Reviewof Registrations of Pesticide Products containing  dinocap (50 FR 1119)based on the Agency's determination that pesticide products containingdinocap met or exceeded the risk criteria in 40 CFR 162.11(a)(3)(ii)(B)for producing a ``chronic or delayed toxic effect in test animals.'' Specifically,the Special Review was initiated because laboratory studies in rabbitsdemonstrated that dinocap has the potential to produce teratogenic effects.The Agency determined that dermal and inhalation exposure to dinocap maypresent significant risks to pregnant women who apply the product. The risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 162.11(a)(3)(ii)(B) have been supercededby new criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7(a)(2), which provide that a SpecialReview may be conducted if the use of a pesticide ``may pose a risk ofinducing in humans an oncogenic, heritable genetic, teratogenic, fetotoxic,reproductive effect, or a chronic or delayed toxic effect, which risk isof concern in terms of either the degree of risk to individual humans orthe number of humans at some risk * * *.'' Dinocap also exceeds the newcriteria. Based on an evaluation of the available information, includinginformation received in public comments to the Notice of Special Review,on October 14, 1986, EPA issued a Notice of Preliminary Determination andNotice of Availability of the Technical Support Document and a Draft Noticeof Intent to Cancel. In the Preliminary Determination the Agency announcedits proposed decision to cancel registrations of dinocap products unlesscertain modifications were made to the terms and conditions of registration.These proposed modifications were:1. All products for all uses (pears, apples, grapes, field cucurbits, greenhouseuses, field roses, peaches and apricots, and home lawn and gardens) mustbear a teratogenicity warning statement. 2. All wettable powder formulations for use on pears, apples, grapes, fieldcucurbits, greenhouse uses, field roses, peaches and apricots must be packagedin water soluble bags. 3. All ground boom, airblast and mist blower applications to pears, apples,grapes, field cucurbits, greenhouse uses, field roses, peaches and apricotsmust be made from enclosed vehicles. 4. App1icators must wear long-s1eeved shirts and long pants, and will alsobe required to wear chemical-resistant gloves when exiting the vehicleor while repairing equipment. 5. All products for use on pears, apples, grapes, field cucurbits, greenhouseuses, field roses, peaches and apricots must be classified for restricteduse, with the additional requirement that certified applicators be physicallypresent while the application is taking place. For liquid products for use on peaches and apricots, and wettable powderproducts already packaged in water soluble packaging for use on peachesand apricots, there were adequate margins of safety. The Agency believedthat these modifications would provide adequate margins of safety, takinginto consideration risks and benefits, for all categories of mixers, loaders,and applicators. In the Preliminary Determination, the Agency also noted that the manufacturerof technical dinocap, Rohm and Haas, was developing a dinocap technicalproduct of higher purity than the currently available dinocap. Currenttechnical dinocap is an approximately 80 to 85 percent pure mixture ofthe cis- and trans- isomers of 2,4-dinitro-6-octylphenol crotonate and2,6-dinitro-6-octylphenol crotonate, the remainder consisting of otherreaction compounds. There was some evidence, based on a teratogenicityscreening test performed by the Agency at Research Triangle Park, NorthCarolina, that the isomers of dinocap were not developmentally toxic (Ref.21). If this evidence were confirmed, it would indicate that the developmentallytoxic component of dinocap is the other reaction products. Therefore, apurer technical dinocap should be less developmentally toxic, since itwould contain less of the developmentally toxic component. The new technicalmaterial is about 95 percent pure. On January 14, 1988, the Rohm and HaasCompany applied to amend the registration of its current technical dinocapproduct to reflect the new, purer form of dinocap. The Agency is reviewingthis application to amend the registration of dinocap, and will decidewhether to approve the amended registration pending the submission andreview of required studies. This Notice addresses only the current, lesspure, dinocap formulation. The most common formulation of dinocap is as a mixture with another fungicide,mancozeb. Mancozeb and several related pesticides, collectively calledthe ``EBDC fungicides'', are also undergoing special review. This Notice,however, concerns only the risks and benefits of dinocap. Following review of public comments on the Preliminary Determination andall available data, the Agency has determined that the risks of developmentaltoxicity remain; however, these risks can be reduced to acceptable levelsif the modifications specified in Unit IV of this Notice are made. TheAgency will cancel the registrations of dinocap products and deny applicationsfor registration of such products which have not complied with the modifiedterms and conditions of registration set forth in this Notice within 30days of publication or receipt of this notice by the registrants, whicheveroccurs later. C. Legal Background Before a pesticide product may be lawfully sold or distributed in eitherintrastate or interstate commerce, the product must be registered by theEnvironmental Protection Agency [FIFRA sections 3(a) and 12(a)(1)]. A registrationis a license allowing a pesticide product to be sold and distributed forspecified uses in accordance with specified use instructions, precautions,and other terms and conditions. In order to obtain a registration for apesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act,as amended (FIFRA), an applicant for registration must demonstrate thatthe pesticide satisfies the statutory standard for registration. The standardrequires, among other things, that the pesticide perform its intended functionwithout causing ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment,'' underFIFRA section 3(c)(5). The term ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment''is defined under FIFRA section 2(bb) as ``any unreasonable risk to manor the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmentalcosts and benefits of the use of any pesticide.'' This standard requiresa finding that the benefits resulting from the use of the pesticide exceedthe risks resulting from use, when the pesticide is used in compliancewith the terms and conditions of registration or in accordance with commonlyrecognized practices. The burden of proving that a pesticide satisfies the statutory standardis on the proponents of registration and continues as long as the registrationremains in effect. Under section 6 of FIFRA, the Administrator may cancelthe registration whenever it is determined that the pesticide causes unreasonableadverse effects on the environment. The Agency created the Special Reviewprocess to facilitate the identification of pesticide uses which may notsatisfy the statutory requirements for registration and to provide an informalprocedure to gather and evaluate information about the risks and benefitsof these uses. A Special Review is initiated if a pesticide meets or exceeds risk criteriaset out in the regulations at 40 CFR Part 154. The Agency announces thata Special Review is initiated by publishing a notice in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Registrants and other interested persons areinvited to review the data upon which the review is based and to submitdata and information to rebut the Agency's conclusions. Such data and informationmay rebut the Agency's conclusions by showing that the Agency's initialdetermination was in error or by showing that use of the pesticide is notlikely to result in any significant risk to human health or the environment.In addition to submitting evidence to rebut the Agency's initial determination,commenters may submit relevant information to aid in the determinationof whether the economic, social, and environmental benefits of the useof the pesticide outweigh the risks of use. After reviewing the commentsreceived and other relevant material obtained during the Special Reviewprocess, the Agency makes a decision on the future status of the pesticideregistrations.The Special Review process may be culminated in several ways, dependingupon the outcome of the Agency's risk/benefit assessment. If the Agencyconcludes that all of its risk concerns have been adequately rebutted,the pesticide registration will be maintained unchanged. However, if allrisk concerns are not rebutted, the Agency will proceed to a risk/benefitassessment. In determining whether the use of a pesticide poses risks whichare greater than the benefits, the Agency considers possible changes tothe terms and conditions of registration which can reduce risks, and theimpacts of such modifications on the benefits of use. If the Agency determinesthat such changes reduce risks to the level where the benefits outweighthe risks, it may require that such changes be made in the terms and conditionsof the registrations. Alternatively, the Agency may determine that no changesin the terms and conditions of a registration will adequately assure thatuse of the pesticide will not pose any unreasonable adverse effects. Ifthe Agency makes such a determination, it may seek cancellation, and, ifnecessary, suspension. In either case, the Agency must issue a Notice ofIntent to Cancel the registrations. If the Notice requires changes in theterms and conditions of registration, cancellation may be avoided by makingthe specified changes set forth in the Notice. Adversely affected personsmay also request a hearing on the cancellation of a specified registrationand use, and if they do so in a legally effective manner, that registrationand use will be continued pending a decision at the close of an administrativehearing. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Risk and Benefit Assessments and Evaluation of Comments </ITAG>A. Summary of Toxicological Studies Used to Support the Preliminary DecisionThe effect of concern for dinocap is developmental toxicity. The Agency``Guidelines for the Health Assessment of Suspect Developmental Toxicants''(51 FR 34028) define developmental toxicity as including (1) death of thedeveloping organism, (2) malformation, (3) altered growth, and (4) functionaldeficiency. Teratogenicity is considered to be synonymous with structuralanomalies, i.e., malformations. Rohm and Haas have submitted two oral teratology studies of dinocap (Refs.1 and 2); the effects observed were primarily neural tube and skull malformations.These studies, described on pp. II-1-2 of the Technical Support Document,showed the oral teratogenicity no-observed effect level (NOEL) in the rabbitto be 0.5 mg/kg/day. Based on these studies, a Special Review was initiatedbecause of the Agency's concern that exposure to dinocap posed a risk ofteratogenic effects to humans. After the initiation of the Special Review, Rohm and Haas submitted a dermaldose-range finding study (Ref. 3) and a primary dermal teratology studyin rabbits (Ref. 4). Dermal exposure to technical dinocap during the periodof organogenesis produced dermal irritation in rabbits at all dosage levelstested (25, 50, 100 mg/kg/day). Frank systemic toxicity in the dams wasobserved in the 100 mg/kg group as evidenced by significant decreases infood consumption and body weight gains observed during the dosing period.There were several indications of developmental toxicity seen in this study.The incidence of litters with skeletal abnormalities was increased in alltreated groups (11.8, 18.7, 20.0, and 21.4 percent, for the control, 25,50 and 100 mg/kg/day groups, respectively). An increase in both litterand fetal incidents of ``skull, bone islands'' was found at the highestdose tested (100 mg/kg/day). The occurrence of extra skull ossificationcenters, considered to be a form of fetal toxicity, is unusual. Reducedfetal weight was also observed at the 100 mg/kg/day dose. Developmental toxicity in the form of reduced fetal weight was observedat the highest dose (100 mg/kg/day). Since statistically significant decreasesin fetal weight were noted at the 200 mg/kg/day dose (Ref. 3), the decreasein fetal weight noted at the 100 mg/kg/day was regarded as potentiallytreatment-related. Scoliosis (lateral curvature of the spine), previouslyobserved in the oral studies, was also present in the dermal study butdid not attain a statistical difference. Three of the 40 treated litters(affecting 1 litter in each of the 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day groups) hadscoliosis as compared to 3/155 of the historical control litters. Further,an increase (not statistically different) in the incidence of skull abnormalitieswas found at the 100 mg/kg/day dosage level. The findings in the 100 mg/kg/daydose could be biologically significant and a dermal development toxicityNOEL was therefore established at 50 mg/kg/day. Because of the dermal study, in the Preliminary Decision the effect ofconcern for dinocap was broadened to the general endpoint of developmentaltoxicity rather than the narrow definition generally associated with theterm teratogenicity. Teratogenicity, as noted before, is usually consideredto be synonomous with structural anomalies. Because all four manifestationsof developmental toxicity are of concern, the Agency Guidelines directthat developmental toxicity risk assessments be based on the NOEL for themost sensitive manifestation. The Agency used the dermal NOEL rather thanthe previously established oral NOEL because most of the dinocap exposureto applicators, the group at highest risk, is via the dermal route. 1. <T3>Scientific Advisory Panel comments on the toxicological data base.</T3>The Agency's proposed decision to cancel the uses of dinocap (unlesscertain modifications were made to the terms of registration) was submittedto the Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) for review in accordance with section6 of FIFRA. The Panel's report, which is reprinted in its entirety in UnitIII of this document, noted several comments on the dinocap developmentaltoxicity data. First, the Panel agreed that the weight-of-evidence supportsthe conclusion that dinocap is a developmental toxicant in the rabbit bythe oral route. Second, the Panel believed that the small group size andlimitation of studies to one species limited the certainty of calculatedmargins of safety. They believed that the dermal data were inconclusiveand the data could not be used to establish a confident NOEL and marginof safety. The Panel offered several possibilities for improving the dataset. They suggested that teratology studies be done in another species,first by the oral route. Other suggestions and comments of the Panel arediscussed in Unit II.B. of this document.The Agency does not agree with the SAP that the available dermal teratologystudies may not permit calculation of MOS's for dinocap. The study hasbeen carefully reviewed and judged adequate for risk assessment purposes.The number of animals tested was in accordance with Agency guidelines.The Agency does not believe that limitation of dermal data to one species,the rabbit, invalidates any conclusions on risk. The developmental toxicityseen in the dermal teratology study in rabbits is consistent with the developmentaltoxicity seen in the oral teratology studies in rabbits and another testspecies. Two oral studies using CD-1 mice (Refs. 7 and 20) demonstratedthe developmental toxicity effects of dinocap. Further, it is Agency policyto use data obtained by the expected route of human exposure, when suchdata are available. In the case of dinocap, agricultural workers are primarilyexposed by the dermal route; thus, data from the dermal developmental toxicitystudy are most appropriate for risk assessment. 2. <T3>Other comments on toxicology studies. </T3>Rohm and Haas commentedon the dermal dose selected as the NOEL for dinocap, saying that the effectsobserved were not statistically significant nor dose-related, and thatthe reduced fetal weights observed were within historical controls. As noted in the Preliminary Determination, and as the SAP has agreed, oraldevelopmental toxicity studies in the rabbit have shown a developmentaltoxicity NOEL of 0.5 mg/kg, with a variety of neural tube-related anomaliesobserved at dose levels of 3.0 mg/kg and greater. In dermal testing inthe rabbit, at dose levels of 0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg, compound-relatedteratogenic findings did not appear to be statistically increased at anydose level. However, indications of structural abnormalities (skull, delayedossification) and altered growth were observed at 100 mg/kg. Altered growth(decreased fetal weight) became significant at the 200 mg/kg. Althoughthe incidences at the 100 mg/kg dosage level were not statistically differentfrom concurrent and historical control ranges, they still were biologicallyrelevant in light of the positive trend. As per the consensus obtainedfrom a workshop organized by the Agency (Ref. 22) an adverse developmentaleffect occurring at the statistically significant 1evel at the highestexposure level (i.e., 200 mg/kg/day) can be considered treatment relatedeven at lower doses (i.e. 100 mg/kg/day) in which the observed differencein incidence from the concurrent control value may not achieve statisticalsignificance. A dermal developmental toxicity NOEL was therefore conservativelyestablished by the Agency at the next lower dose, 50 mg/kg/day. The Agencyhas used this value in calculating margins of safety in the Final Determination.B. Exposure and Risk Determinations 1. <T3>Summary of exposure and risk assessment in the Preliminary Determination.</T3>The exposure assessment used in the Preliminary Determination consideredonly dermal exposure of mixer/loaders and applicators from the agriculturaland home uses of dinocap. Although inhalation was cited as a route of exposurein initiating the Special Review, it was not exhaustively evaluated becauseit comprises only a small component of total exposure (usually less than1 percent) and does not significantly affect margins of safety. Dietaryexposure was not considered at length becauae worst case calculations atthe time of the initiation of the Special Review showed that food residuesof dinocap at tolerance levels were within adequate margins of safety (andless;100)for the risks of developmental toxicity. Farmworkers who do not mix, load,or apply dinocap have adequate margins of safety (andless;100) for the risksof developmental toxicity even if the farmworkers reenter treated areason the same day that dinocap is applied (Ref. 15). At the time of the Preliminary Determination, dinocap labels for agriculturaluse required that mixer/loaders wear protective gloves, boots, coveralls,a face shield or goggles, and a chemical-resistant apron. The exposureanalysis in the Preliminary Determination assumed that agricultural mixer/loaderswore the protective clothing required on the label, and that applicatorswore a long-sleeved shirt and pants (Refs. 16 and 23). It was also assumedthat the same person did both the mixing/loading and application. It wasestimated that approximately 825 applicators were women. Other assumptionsregarding exposure are detailed on pages II-7 and II-8 of the TechnicalSupport Document. In estimating the range of likely exposures for workers involved in applicationof dinocap, the Agency used a standard methodology in which exposure datafor other pesticides, ``surrogate data'', are used to derive exposure estimates(Ref. 10). Surrogate studies are used to estimate dermal exposure to pesticidesbecause the factors that most influence pesticide dermal exposure are formulation,application method, and application rate. These factors are more relatedto a pesticide's use patterns than to the properties of the pesticide itself.Thus, by knowing the formulation, application rate, and application methodof a pesticide, and by knowing the average area of a crop to be treated,it is possible to estimate dermal exposure to a pesticide on the basisof how much of the pesticide a mixer/loader or applicator handles. Therefore,dermal exposure to dinocap was calculated by combining the results of surrogatestudies with information about dinocap use patterns. The following Table1 shows the estimated range of combined mixing/loading and applicationexposures to dinocap by crop and formulation type. The Agency used theseexposure values in calculating Margins of safety in the Preliminary Determination.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1._Combined Mixer/Loader and Applicator Exposures to Dinocap(in mg/kg/day) Used in the Preliminary Determination </T4><H1>Crop </H1><H1>Formulation </H1><H1>Combined exposure</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Peaches/Apricots <D>Liquid </D><D>0.11-0.16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Wettable powder </D><D>0.14-0.21 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Pears <D>Liquid </D><D>0.50-1.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Wettable powder </D><D>0.66-1.6 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Apples <D>Liquid </D><D>0.40-0.50 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Wettable powder </D><D>0.53-0.66 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Grapes <D>Liquid </D><D>0.66-1.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Wettable powder </D><D>0.88-2.3 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Field cucurbits <D>Liquid </D><D>0.16 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><D>(0.084-1.9)\1\ </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Wettable powder </D><D>0.36 </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D/><D>(0.28-2.1)\1\ </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Field roses <D>Liquid </D><D>0.21-0.26 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Wettable powder </D><D>0.27-0.35 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Greenhouse uses <D>Liquid </D><D>0.16-0.25 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Homeowner garden <D>Liquid </D><D>.0056-.022\2\ </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Dust </D><D>.0016-.0084 </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Homeowner turf <D>Liquid </D><D>.016 </D><F>\1\ Geometric mean (range). Dinocap is applied to field cucurbits byground booms rather than by air blast sprayers; exposure values from thesurrogate database for ground boom applications range over three ordersof magnitude, with most of the data points at the lower end of the range.Because of this wide range, a geometric mean exposure was calculated forfield cucurbits rather than a simple weighted mean. A geometric mean ismore representative under these conditions because it is less influencedby outlying data points. Both the geometric mean and the range are shownhere, however. </F><F>\2\ In the Technical Support Document, the higher end of this rangewas reported to be 0.222 mg/kg/day; the correct value is 0.022 mg/kg/day.The MOS calculations for this use have been recalculated with the lowervalue throughout this Notice.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Risks presented by developmentally toxic pesticides, such as dinocap, areexpressed in terms of ``margins of safety'' (MOS). The margin of safetyis a safety criterion used to assess hazard and is defined as the ratioof the no-observed effect level (NOEL) to estimated daily exposure. Generally,the Agency becomes concerned when the margin-of-safety for a particularuse of a developmentally toxic pesticide is less than 100. In determiningrisk from dinocap exposure, the Agency also evaluated available pharmacokineticdata in order to establish the internal absorbed dose. At the time thedermal teratology study was submitted, Rohm and Haas also submitted a dermalpharmacokinetic study of dinocap in female rabbits and in rhesus monkeys.In the pharmacokinetic study in female rabbits, conducted as an adjunctto the rabbit dermal teratology study (Ref. 6), the doses used were thesame as those in the dermal teratology study. It was found that 5.1 percentof the applied dose was absorbed. In the dermal penetration study of dinocap in rhesus monkeys (Ref. 24),it was determined that the dermal absorption rate was 15.7 percent. Thehigher absorption rate found in monkeys vs. rabbits was reflected in themargin-of-safety calculations in the Preliminary Determination. This wasdone because it was assumed that the dermal kinetics in monkeys was similarto humans.

The Panel suggested that additionaldermal teratology studies be conducted when absorbed dose reaches a steadystate, so that dose could be measured accurately. Where appropriate theysuggested using urinary metabolites to quantify the dose that gets metabolizedas well as determining exposure on the basis of metabolite levels in plasmaand tissue. They expressed concern that dermal absorption estimates inhumans reflected only the concentration of dinocap on the skin surfaceand not the dose delivered to potential target tissues. In regard to the SAP's first and last comment above, the Agency notesthat its calculations in the Preliminary Determination did reflect an estimateof absorbed dose, based on rabbit and monkey pharmacokinetic data, andnot just the concentration of dinocap on the skin. The Agency believedit had achieved a reasonable estimate of internal absorbed dose. Because of the many variables involved in attempts to determine absorbeddose from measurements based on metabolite levels in urine, plasma andtissue, this would not be a practical approach at this time. That metabolitedata would not be relevant is especially true in this case, in which theregistrant is actively providing the basic data to support the registrationof a new technical material; the new material appears to be less developmentallytoxic than the dinocap under Special Review. The Panel also commented that they were not convinced that the 50 percentreduction in exposure attributed to the use of long-sleeved shirts andlong pants was appropriate. Although not stated, the Panel's concern appearsto be that the value is too high, i.e., penetration through clothing maybe higher than 50 percent. Rohm and Haas objected that the 50 percent valueunderstates the amount of protection provided by protective clothing. Protectiveclothing is defined in 40 CFR 170.2(d)  as including a long-sleeved shirtand long pants. EPA recognizes that no single value will accurately represent the extentto which protective clothing reduces pesticide exposure for every individualwearing such clothing. In fact, data show that there is considerable variationin the protection level afforded by wearing protective clothing, both betweenindividuals and for the same individual under different conditions. Thus,it is very difficult to characterize the impact on exposure from wearingprotective clothing. When assessing the impact of wearing protective clothing on exposure todinocap, the Agency used surrogate monitoring data, that is, monitoringdata collected for other pesticides applied under conditions similar todinocap. The dinocap exposure study submitted by Rohm and Haas monitoreddermal exposure underneath water-resistant rainsuits. The Agency did notuse these data because it believes the use of water-resistant clothingis atypical. The use of surrogate data is necessary because many variablesare encountered when conducting exposure monitoring studies in the field.Some of these variables, such as weather and the care exercised by applicators,cannot be controlled by the supervisor of the study; because of these uncontrollablefactors, experimental results can vary widely. Thus, the Agency believesthat a more scientifically reliable assessment of the value of protectiveclothing results from using a broad range of surrogate exposure data thanfrom relying on the results of a few studies or even a single study ofa pesticide of special concern, since the more limited data base wouldnot be as likely to reflect the wide range of variables affecting exposure. The surrogate data base shows great variability in pesticide penetrationvalues, but with most data points in the 5 to 10 percent penetration range.Davies (Ref. 5) reported that ethion penetration through the clothing ofmixers averaged 28 percent, and 17 percent for airblast applicators. Maddy(Ref. 12) determined that the penetration of dinoseb through the outerlayer of the clothing of mixer/loader truck drivers averaged 2.0 and 2.3percent on the first day of the study, and 240 and 1.2 percent on the nextday. For hand wand applicators, the average penetration of dinoseb was6.6 and 170 percent for one applicator, and 5.9 and 72 percent for a secondapplicator. Nigg (Ref. 13) reported that the mean penetration of dicofolthrough the shirts of mixer/loaders and applicators ranged from 1.3 to35 percent, with the penetration on any given day ranging from 0 to 300percent. In a later report, Nigg (Ref. 14) reported the penetration ofpesticides through Tyvek, a fabric designed to have low penetration, torange from 0 to 23 percent.The penetration values which exceed 100 percent suggest, in effect, thatprotective clothing in these instances has very little or no protectivevalue. Penetration values larger than 100 percent are possible becauseof the method by which penetration is calculated; it is the ratio of theamount of pesticide found in external patches to the amount of pesticidefound in patches within the applicator's protective clothing. Occasionallylarger amounts of pesticide are found inside the clothing than outside,due to ``wicking'', the movement of pesticide through the material of theprotective suit by capillary action, and to other indirect routes of internaldeposition. In sum, the available data on the impact of protective clothing show awide range of penetration values. A few measurements of pesticide depositionare greater within the protective clothing than on the outside of the clothing,suggesting that the clothing had little or no protective value. Most datapoints, however, show considerable reduction in exposure, with the mostcommon penetration of pesticide through clothing in the range of 5 to 10percent. EPA does not believe that more sophisticated statistical analysisof the data_for instance, to determine mean, median, or 90th percentilelevels_would be appropriate, given the limited nature of current data andthe large degree of variability in the data points. In light of the above, the Agency agrees, in a sense, with both the SAPand Rohm and Haas objections to the assumption that protective clothingwill reduce dinocap exposure by 50 percent. For some individuals, exposureto covered areas of the body may not be halved by wearing protective clothing,but for many, exposure to these areas is likely to be reduced by considerablymore than half. The Agency, however, continues to believe that the useof the 50 percent penetration value is appropriate in initially assessingthe impact of wearing protective clothing. There are not sufficient data available to identify a single statisticallyvalid value for clothing penetration. While the clustering of data pointsin the range of 5 to 10 percent penetration is suggestive of what mightbe typical, there are enough excursions above that range to create a needto employ a safety factor. The 50 percent penetration figure was chosenbecause it incorporates an ample safety factor above the 5 to 10 percentpenetration values typically seen in the surrogate data base and includesmany of the outlying excursions representing higher penetrations as well.Furthermore, the 50 percent figure does not overstate the data, in thatit does not represent an attempt to capture every excursion beyond 5 to10 percent penetration. These examples of extremely high penetration valuesare interpreted as outliers which are not likely to be representative oftypical experience. As an additional step in its risk assessment, EPA determined whether,and to what extent the use of different penetration values would affectthe Agency's regulatory decision for each use. This ``sensitivity'' analysiswas based on the risk/benefit finding that for every use the costs of theproposed regulatory measures (the ``benefits'') were exceeded by the risksassociated with continued unregulated use resulting in MOS's of less than100. In essence, then, the MOS's above 100 were found to not cause unreasonableadverse effects and thus require no additional regulation, while MOS'sless than 100 were found to cause unreasonable adverse effects and thusrequire additional regulation. The questions posed by the sensitivity analysiswere, does the use of different clothing penetration assumptions move theMOS above or below 100, and what is the range of penetration assumptionswhich will not cause the MOS to move above or below the 100 threshold? For all formulations for peaches and apricots and liquids used in greenhousesany clothing penetration assumptions from 0 to 100 percent would give MOS'sgreater than 100. Thus, the use of any clothing penetration assumptionhas no effect on the Agency's regulatory position. For wettable powderformulations for grapes and field cucurbits, the clothing penetration wouldhave to be 0 percent in order for the Agency not to propose regulatorychanges. Because it is highly unlikely that protective clothing affords100 percent protection, the use of any prudent protective clothing assumptionshas little effect on the Agency's regulatory position. For wettable powder formulations for pears and liquid formulations forgrapes and field cucurbits, any clothing penetration assumption from 10to 100 percent protection would have resulted in MOS's below 100. The frequencyof excursions above 10 percent penetration make an assumption of 10 percentor less penetration imprudent; thus, the use of any prudent protectiveclothing assumptions for these uses would have little effect on the Agency'sregulatory position. For the wettable powder formulation for use on apples,by far the most used formulation, any penetration value from 100 to 30percent would result in a MOS less than 100. Again, the frequency of excursionsabove 30 percent penetration make a 70 percent protection assumption imprudent.Thus, the use of any prudent protective clothing assumptions for theseuses would not affect the Agency's regulatory position. For liquid formulations on apples, any penetration value less than 50percent would result in a MOS greater than 100. Thus, the protective clothingassumption could affect the Agency's regulatory position. For pears, atthe reduced application rate required in the Final Determination, any valuefrom 60 to 0 percent penetration would result in a MOS greater than 100.Although there are instances of excursions above 60 percent, these incidentsare likely to be unusual. Although a different clothing protection assumptioncould affect the Agency's regulatory position for this use, such an assumptionwould not likely represent a typical use situation.For wettable powder formulations used on field roses, any value from 70to 0 percent penetration would result in a MOS greater than 100. The proprietyand impact of using different clothing penetration assumptions for thisuse would be similar to those described for pears above. Finally, for liquidformulations for field roses any value from 0 to 90 percent penetrationwould result in a MOS greater than 100. Because clothing penetration valuesgreater than 90 percent are considered very unusual, the use of any reasonableclothing protection value would have no effect on the Agency's regulatoryposition. For all the uses for which the Agency is requiring the use of enclosedcabs to increase MOS's to acceptable levels, the Agency would have hadto assume a protective value for areas of the body covered by protectiveclothing of almost 100 percent, in order not to impose this requirement.In conclusion, the 50 percent penetration value used by the Agency in itsrisk assessment reflects a number of scientific and policy judgments. Thesurrogate data base provides some scientific guidance for the choice ofan appropriate clothing protection factor. However, policy considerationsalso contribute significantly to the decision. Public health policy concernsrequire that a safety factor be employed when, as here, the data do notprovide a precise answer. Economic concerns also require that the choiceof a safety factor not represent an unrealistic and over-protective choice.For these reasons, the Agency believes that the 50 percent penetrationvalue represents an appropriate choice. 3. <T3>Other comments on exposure and risk assessment. </T3>Rohm and Haascommented that the Agency has used different penetration values at differenttimes, citing the Alachlor Position Document 1 (80 percent) and the DinocapTechnical Support Document in its assessment of exposure from home andgarden application of dinocap (90 percent). The Agency notes that the alachlor document estimated the reduction inexposure by going from no clothing to protective clothing and gloves. However,in retrospect, the Agency agrees that it was inconsistent to use 90 percentreduction for home and garden situations involving dinocap; the value wasbased on a Kurtz and Bode study (Ref. 11), submitted by Rohm and Haas.The Agency believes that the penetration value established for agriculturaluses (50 percent) is also appropriate for home and garden applications.The increased estimated exposure values do not significantly affect themargin of safety calculations for home and garden use. Rohm and Haas also commented that the Preliminary Determination was incorrectin stating that dinocap labels are ambiguous or silent on requiring applicatorsto wear gloves. The labels clearly require the applicator to use protectivegloves or an enclosed cab. The Agency agrees that all dinocap labels clearly require that applicatorsuse protective gloves, and has assumed that gloves are worn in its calculationsof applicator exposure for the Final Determination. Rohm and Haas questioned the time and acreage estimates for grapes andfield roses used in the exposure assessment. They proposed that the acreagethat can be treated in a normal day be calculated by assuming a treatmentrate of 4.9 acres/hour over a 6-hour treatment day. This would result ina maximum treated area of 30 acres per day. This calculation method, whichassumes a smaller treatment area per day, would reduce mixer/loader andapplicator exposure, because the Agency assumes that exposure is basedon total amount of pesticide handled per day, which in turn is based onacreage treated per day. The Agency does not accept this approach to calculating acreage treated.The Agency's estimates of treatment areas per day are based on contactswith growers, agricultural extension experts, and university personnel.According to these sources, growers will work as long as 18 hours to completespray operations, and so a 12-hour spray period, as assumed in the PreliminaryDetermination, does not appear unreasonable. Rohm and Haas commented that the 1.5 lb a.i./acre application rate on pearswas unrealistically high, and should be reduced to 0.47 lbs. a.i./acre.The Agency notes that 1.5 lb. a.i./acre application rate on pears is themaximum label rate for the liquid concentrate formulation (Ref. 17). Thelabel states the application rate for pears to be 20 to 48 oz/acre of the4 lb. a.i./gal formulation; this is equal to 0.625 to 1.5 lb. a.i./acre.The label rate suggested for the wettable powder is 0.5 lbs. of a 19.5percent a.i. formulation per 100 gallons of water, 600 to 800 gallons tobe used per acre. This is equal to 0.58 to 0.78 lbs. a.i./acre. However,based on Rohm and Hass' comment, the Agency will reduce the maximum applicationrate for liquid formulations of dinocap for use on pears to 0.47 lbs. a.i./acre. 4.<T3> Conclusions on exposure and risk assessment.</T3> The Agency has adjustedits final exposure/risk calculations based on the comments received anddiscussed in Units II.B.2. and 3. (50 percent penetration value for protectiveclothing worn by home and garden applicators, gloves assumed to be wornby applicators, and reduced application rate for pears) as well as on informationdiscussed below that was received after the Preliminary Determination wasissued. Specifically, the Agency determined that apparent procedural deficienciesin the monkey dermal penetration study (Ref. 24) may render it invalid,and therefore no conclusions on dermal absorption can be based on thisstudy at this time. The Agency also learned that the rabbit pharmacokineticstudy (Ref. 6) involved only one isomer of dinocap and that isomer hasbeen shown not to be developmentally toxic in a study conducted by theAgency (Ref. 21). The material tested for dermal absorption is not thematerial that is developmentally toxic and the resulting absorption valueof 5.1 percent used in the Preliminary Determination can no longer be usedin calculating margins of safety for dinocap. Thus, in the final calculationsof dinocap margins of safety the Agency divided the NOEL, 50 mg/kg/day,by the estimated applicator exposure in mg/kg/day, without making a species-specificadjustment for dermal penetration. This procedure has the effect of assumingan equivalent dermal absorption of dinocap for humans and rabbits, independentof any specific estimate of the rate of such absorption. The effect onthe calculated margins of safety in the Final Determination, compared tothe Preliminary Determination, is to increase margins of safety by a factorof three, since the previous adjustment including a three-fold greateradsorption by monkeys (15.7 percent) compared to rabbits (5.1 percent). The following table, Table 3, shows (1) estimated exposures and marginsof safety resulting from use of label required protective clothing, (2)estimated exposures and margins of safety resulting from use of protectiveclothing required in the Final Determination, and (3) estimated exposuresand margins of safety resulting from use of protective clothing and enclosedcabs required in the Final Determination.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration 3 925</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG> C. Benefits Assessment and Evaluation of Comments 1.<T3> Summary of benefits assessment in the Preliminary Determination.</T3>In the Preliminary Determination, the Agency assessed at length the benefitsof the continued use of dinocap on a major site, apples, and a minor site,ornamentals. Use on ornamentals was selected because of concern about thepossibility of high exposure to home gardeners. The Agency has solicitedcomment from registrants and user groups on the economic importance ofdinocap for the remaining uses (pears, grapes, field cucurbits, greenhouseuses, peaches and apricots, and home lawn and garden) but has receivedno further information. Therefore, the remaining sites were not reviewed.The Agency believes dinocap is much less important to these sites, basedon the small percentage of dinocap used on those sites and the small percentageof those sites to which dinocap is applied. This section summarizes thePreliminary Determination's assessment of the benefits of the apple andornamental uses of dinocap; these benefits are discussed at greater lengthon pp. III 1-14 of the Technical Support Document. About 30 percent of the U.S. apple acreage is treated with dinocap, mostlyin the East and North Central regions. Dinocap is usually applied to applefoliage as a spray. The principal application method is by airblast sprayer.The target pest is powdery mildew, but dinocap also provides some controlof mites. Although there are other fungicides registered to control powderymildew, resistance by the powdery mildew fungus has been reported for someof them; no dinocap resistance either by powdery mildew or mites has beenreported. The alternatives to dinocap are described at length on pp. IV4-6 of the Technical Support Document. If dinocap registrations were canceled for use on apples, the Agency estimatedtotal short term cost increases of $3.9 million per year, ranging from$1.2 to $6.7 million per year. These increases would be regionally distributed:Northwest, $25,000; North Central, $883,000; and East, $3 million. Based on recent production budgets (Ref. 19), the average total variableproduction cost per affected acre would increase less than 1 percent inthe Northwest, and 5 percent or less in the North Central and East regions.Costs per affected acre would increase $6.37 in the Northwest, $5.25 inthe North Central, and $6.76 in the East. Based on these estimates, onthe average number of acres per farm by region, and on the regional variationin number of dinocap treatments, the total cost increase per year to atypical affected grower would be $170 to $690 in the Northwest, $530 to$1310 in the North Central, and $1030 to $2310 in the East. The unavailability of dinocap would not be expected to affect the quantityor quality of apples available to the consumer, but there might be a slightincrease in short term retail prices because of increases in productioncosts. Dinocap is used only to a very limited extent for powdery mildewcontrol in ornamental plants. For both home and garden and commercial ornamentaluse, dinocap has a negligible market share. There are numerous alternativepesticides which provide equal or better control. There might be an increasein treatment costs if dinocap registrations were canceled for this use. 2.<T3> Comments on the benefits assessment.</T3> There was only one commenton the benefits of the use of dinocap. Rohm and Haas commented that theAgency's estimate of the volume of use of dinocap, 500,000 pounds a year,was overstated by a factor of 5. The Agency's estimates were based on general survey data, which are inexactfor relatively small-volume pesticides such as dinocap. The Agency hasaccepted Rohm and Haas' estimation of the volume of use of dinocap, andwill use a 100,000 pound annual usage figure instead. 3.<T3> Conclusions on benefits assessment.</T3> Rohm and Haas did not questionthe Agency's per-acre estimates of the benefits of dinocap usage, and thereforethe Agency has lowered its estimate of benefits by a factor of five toreflect the reduced usage estimates. The Agency does not believe that thisreduction in overall benefits will occur disproportionately from one regionto another, so benefits have been uniformly lowered for each region. Theshort term cost increase for the U.S. apple production is now estimatedas $.78 million (range of $.24 to $1.3 million) per year. This impact wasregionally distributed as follows: Northwest_$5,000; North Central_$176,600;and East (where dinocap use is concentrated) $600,000. The Agency has alsorecalculated the percentage of acreage treated with dinocap based on revisedagricultural census data and data usage provided by the registrant; thisrecalculation lowered the Agency's estimate of the number of applicatorsexposed to dinocap (Ref. 18) to 11,650 before adjustments were made forthe reduced usage noted by Rohm and Hass in their comments. A five-foldreduction in the number of applicators based on reduced usage gives anestimate of 2,330 applicators. Assuming, as was done in Preliminary Determination,that 5 percent of dinocap applicators are women, the number of women applicatorsthat might be at risk is now estimated to be 117.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Comments of the Scientific Advisory Panel, Secretary of Agricultureand Rohm and Haas </ITAG>As required under sections 6 and 25 of FIFRA, the Agency provided its PreliminaryDetermination to the Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) and the Secretaryof Agriculture for their comments. Unit III also includes general commentsfrom Rohm and Haas. Most of the comments submitted by the SAP and Rohmand Haas were addressed in Unit II, Risk and Benefit Assessment. A. Comments of the Scientific Advisory Panel <ITAG tagnum="81">Comments of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide ActScientific Advisory Panel </ITAG>A Set of Scientific Issues Being Considered by the Agency in Connectionwith the Special Review of Dinocap. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) ScientificAdvisory Panel (SAP) has completed review of the data base supporting theEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA) preliminary decision to cancelmost of the registrations of dinocap unless certain modifications to theterms and conditions of registration are made by the registrants. The reviewwas conducted in an open meeting held in Arlington, Virginia, on November20, 1986. All Panel members, except Dr. Harold L. Bergman and Dr. JohnJ. Lech, were present for the review. In addition, Dr. Bernard Schwetz,Chief of the Systemic Toxicology Branch of the Toxicology Research andTesting Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, servedas an <T3>ad hoc </T3>member of the Panel. Public notice of the meeting was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on Friday, October 24, 1986. Oral statements were received from staff of EPA and from Dr. David R. Streelmanof Rohm and Haas Company. In consideration of all matters brought out during the meeting and carefulreview of all documents presented by the Agency, the Panel unanimouslysubmits the following report. Report of Panel Recommendations <ITAG tagnum="81">Dinocap </ITAG>The Agency requested the Panel to focus its attention upon a set of scientificissues relating to the Special Review of dinocap. There follows a listof the issues and the Panel's response to each issue: 1. <T3>The weight-of-evidence supports the conclusion that dinocap is a developmentaltoxicant. </T3><T3>Panel Response: </T3>The Panel agrees that the weight-of-evidence supportsthe conclusion that dinocap is a developmental toxicant in laboratory animals,specifically in rabbits, by the oral route. 2. <T3>The dermal exposure to dinocap can be estimated using available data.</T3><T3>Panel Response: </T3>The Panel is disappointed with the apparent qualityof the data relating to human exposure to dinocap. The Panel is not convincedthat the 50 percent exposure level is appropriate for workers wearing protectiveclothing. The data appear to show that the applicator is at greatest risk.More attention to the applicator's use of protective clothing and/or restrictionto certified applicators may be required. Regarding the exposure assessment, the Panel believes that the plasma/urinary/tissuelevels of metabolites should be used as an index of human exposure, ratherthan concentration on skin surface. 3. <T3>That margins of safety were appropriately estimated using availabledevelopmental toxicity data, dermal absorption estimates and applicatorexposure. </T3><T3>Panel Response: </T3>The Panel is not certain that the human exposureestimates are suitable. The dermal teratology studies may not permit thedetermination of a margin of safety. The small group sizes, the lack ofestimation of dose, and limitation of teratology studies to one species,limit the certainty of the calculated margin of safety. These data areinconclusive, in the Panel's opinion, and this situation prevents the useof these data to establish a confident no-observed effects level and marginof safety. There are several possibilities for improving the data set: obtain teratologystudies in another species, first by the oral route. Alternatively or additionally, do dermal teratology studies when absorbeddose has reached a steady state, so that dose can be determined accuratelyor, where appropriate, use urinary metabolites to quantify the dose thatgets metabolized. Parallel human dosimetry vs. urinary metabolites couldbe conducted. It should be noted that the Panel is concerned that the dermal absorptionestimates in humans reflect only the concentration of dinocap at the skinsurface and not the dose delivered to potential target tissues. As notedpreviously, the Panel wishes to express the need to determine human exposureon the basis of metabolite levels in plasma/urine/tissue, etc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For the Chairman: Certified as an accurate report of Findings: Stephen L. Johnson, ExecutiveSecretary, FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel, Date: November 25, 1986. The Agency's response to the issues raised by the Panel are found in UnitII of this document. In brief, the Panel expressed concern about the confidencelevel in margins of safety calculated from the rabbit dermal teratologystudy. The Panel's focus of concern appears to be lack of supporting urinary,plasma and tissue data to derive an internal absorbed dose. In the PreliminaryDetermination, the Agency did estimate internal dose by utilizing rabbitand monkey pharmacokinetic studies. However, subsequent to the issuanceof the Preliminary Determination, the Agency discovered that the rabbitdata was not conducted on the developmentally toxic component of dinocapand that the monkey study was invalid. The Agency is no longer using thesestudies and has calculated margins of safety in the Final Determinationby dividing the NOEL determined from the rabbit dermal teratology study(50 mg/kg/day) by the estimated applicator exposure expressed in mg/kg/day.The Agency believes that the 50 mg/kg/day NOEL is still appropriate notwithstandingthe concerns raised by the Panel.B.

Dr. Hickey indicatedthat, other than the expense of converting current equipment or purchasingenclosed cab tractors, the system is practical and desirable; he notedthat some growers already use enclosed cab tractors. Generally, expert opinion holds that enclosed cab tractors are alreadyin use, and therefore the Agency considers them as a practical regulatoryoption to reduce exposure to dinocap. However, for those smaller scalegrowers who do not already have enclosed cab tractors, purchasing one couldbe a major expense. It is not known how many eastern growers already haveclosed cab tractors; however, the Agency believes that for those growerswho have pickup trucks which could be fitted to pull airblast sprayersthe costs would not represent a major expense. In addition to the comment by the Secretary on water soluble packaging,Rohm and Haas submitted data showing that water soluble packaging is notpractical for the DikarandCx.175; formulation of dinocap, since the mancozebcomponent embrittles the packaging material. This embrittlement and thesubsequent rupturing of containers of DikarandCx.31; which could be expectedto occur, would occasionally result in very high exposures to dinocap fromaccidents and from clean-up operations. The Agency accepts this commentand will withdraw its proposal to require water soluble packaging for theDikarandCx.31; formulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Final Determination </ITAG>In the Preliminary Determination, the Agency proposed several modificationsto the terms and conditions of registration of dinocap products. The Agency'sproposals were based on its determination that the uses of dinocap as currentlyregistered posed unreasonable adverse effects to applicators and mixer/loadersand the changes in the terms and conditions of registration were necessaryto ensure that the benefits of use outweighed the risks of use. The requirements specified in the Preliminary Determination were listedin Unit I of this document and are discussed in detail in the TechnicalSupport Document. Based on an evaluation of the comments received in responseto the Preliminary Determination as well as additional information receivedsubsequent to its issuance, the Agency has determined that the uses ofdinocap continue to pose unreasonable risks to human health. Therefore,in order for the benefits of use to outweigh the risks of use, and to avoidcancellation, registrations of dinocap products must be modified to meetthe terms and conditions specified in Unit IV. A. and B. of this document.A. Product Label Requirements Based on margins of safety calculated in the Final Determination, severaluses of dinocap will require no label changes except the change specifiedin Unit IV. A.1. below. Those uses that do not require any label changesexcept the change specified in Unit IV.A.1. include: (1) Liquid and wettable powder formulations used on peaches/apricots,and field roses. (2) Liquid formulations used on pears, apples, and in greenhouses. (3) All home and garden uses. 1. All products must bear a developmental toxicity warning statement asfollows: Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product hasbeen determined to cause birth defects in laboratory animals. 2. All liquid formulation products that bear uses for pears must limitthe maximum application rate to 0.47 lbs./acre. 3. All wettable powder formulation products that bear uses for applesmust bear the following label statement for use on apples: During the mixing and loading of concentrated dinocap, wear a protectivesuit of one or two pieces that covers all parts of the body except thehead, hands, and feet. Wear chemical-resistant gloves, chemical-resistantapron, and chemical-resistant shoes, shoe coverings, or boots. Wear gogglesor a face shield. A hood or hat may also be worn. Whenever possible it is recommended that application be made from a vehiclewith a completely enclosed cab. All vents and windows of the cab shouldremain closed during application. During application from a vehicle witha completely enclosed cab, wear a long-sleeve shirt and long pants. A cleanset of protective clothing and equipment as defined here must be availablein case you must exit the cab in treated areas for repairs or other reasons.Always wear protective gloves upon exiting the cab. Remove protective clothingand equipment before reentering the cab to prevent cab contamination. If application from a vehicle with a completely enclosed cab is not possibleand during repair and cleanup of equipment or reentry into treated areasprior to drying of the spray, wear a protective suit of one or two piecesthat covers all parts of the body except the hands, feet, and head. Wearchemical-resistant gloves and chemical-resistant shoes, shoe coveringsor boots. A hood or hat may also be worn. During airblast or mist blowerapplication a protective hood or wide brim hat must be worn. Warning: Wearing the protective suit for the prolonged periods requiredfor application may produce heat stress at temperatures above 85 anddegrees;Fon a cloudy day or 80 anddegrees;F on a sunny day. Application of this productmust be conducted from enclosed cab vehicles when the temperature exceeds85 anddegrees;F (80 anddegrees;F on sunny days) or delayed until the temperaturedrops. After application of the pesticide is completed, remove all clothesand shoes. Shower using soap and water. Redress only in clean clothes.Do not use contaminated clothing. Wash non-disposable protective clothingand protective equipment with soap or detergent and water after each use.Personal and non-disposable protective clothing worn during use must belaundered separately from household articles.

Wear goggles or a face shield. A hoodor hat may also be worn. This product <T3>must</T3> be applied from a vehicle with an enclosed cab. All ventsand windows of the cab should remain closed during the application. Duringapplication, wear a long-sleeve shirt and long pants. A clean set of protectiveclothing and equipment as defined below must be available in case you mustexit the cab in treated areas for repairs or other reasons. Always wearprotective gloves upon exiting the cab. Remove protective equipment beforereentering the cab to prevent cab contamination. Wear the following protective clothing during equipment repair, equipmentcleaning, and during reentry to treated areas before spray has dried: Aprotective suit of one or two pieces that covers all parts of the bodyexcept the hands, feet, and head, chemical-resistant gloves and chemical-resistantshoes, shoe coverings or boots.

Personaland non-disposable protective clothing worn during use must be launderedseparately from household articles. Clothing or protective equipment heavilycontaminated or drenched with dinocap must be destroyed according to stateor local regulations. Heavily contaminated or drenched clothing cannotbe adequately decontaminated.B. Basis for Modification to Terms and Conditions of Registration 1. <T3>Developmental toxicity warning statement on all labels. </T3>The Agencybelieves this statement is necessary for all products to ensure that applicatorsand mixer/loaders as well as home and garden users are aware that thisproduct is a developmental toxicant in test animals and that users willtherefore be more likely to follow use directions carefully and wear requiredprotective clothing. Imposition of this label requirement will not increasecosts to growers and therefore will not diminish the benefits of use ofthis chemical. 2. <T3>Reduced label rate for pears. </T3>Based on information submitted bythe registrant that 0.47 lbs./acre is the maximum rate used in actual practicethe Agency is requiring that label rates reflect this lower use rate. Withouta reduction in the label rate, applicators would have to wear the sameprotective clothing required for wettable powder formulations used on applesin order to achieve an acceptable margin of safety. Imposition of the reducedapplication rate will not impact on growers and consequently will not diminishthe benefits of use of this chemical. 3. <T3>Protective clothing requirement for wettable powder formulations foruse on apples. </T3>In order to achieve acceptable margins of safety, theAgency is requiring that applicators and mixer/loaders wear the specifiedprotective clothing and apply dinocap from an enclosed cab when weatherconditions make it impractical to wear all the required clothing. Acquiringthe protective clothing required by this Notice should result in only minorcosts to growers since the additional protective clothing is already requiredfor mixer/loaders and most growers perform both mixing/loading and application.Therefore, the minimal cost increases that may be incurred for protectiveclothing does not appreciably alter the benefits of use of wettable powderformulations of dinocap on apples. 4. <T3>Protective clothing and enclosed cab requirement for liquid and wettablepowder formulations for grapes and field cucurbits and all wettable powderformulations for pears. </T3>In order to achieve acceptable margins ofsafety, the Agency is requiring that applicators and mixer/loaders wearthe specified protective clothing and apply dinocap from an enclosed cab.Some growers already have tractors with enclosed cabs. For those growerswho do not have such tractors, a pickup truck, available in most farm operations,can be used to pull spray equipment in many application situations. Somesmall scale growers might face an expense of several thousand dollars inpurchasing a tractor with an enclosed cab or a pick up truck, or retrofittinga tractor with an enclosed cab. The Agency believes the additional costsof acquiring enclosed cab equipment, minimal in most cases, will not significantlydiminish the benefits of dinocap for these uses. 5. <T3>Summary. </T3>The Agency has concluded that if the modifications tothe terms and conditions of registration of dinocap products as specifiedin this Notice are made, the benefits of use outweigh the risks of continueduse. The Agency is not imposing the restricted use classification, noris it requiring the use of closed mixing systems, both measures proposedin the Preliminary Determination, because if the modifications to the termsand conditions of registration of dinocap as specified in this Notice aremade, the benefits of use outweigh the risks of continued use, and suchfurther measures are unnecessary. C. Existing Stocks Provisions Pursuant to FIFRA section 6(a)(1), ``the Administrator may permit the continuedsale and use of existing stocks of a pesticide whose registration [is cancelledpursuant to this Notice] to such extent, under such conditions, and forsuch uses as he may specify, if he determines that such sale or use isnot inconsistent with the purposes of [FIFRA] and will not have unreasonableadverse effects on the environment.'' For purposes of this Notice, ``existingstocks'' are defined as any quantity of dinocap products subject to thisNotice that has been formulated, packaged and labeled for use and is beingheld for shipment or release or has been shipped and released into commerceprior to the date by which the registration of the product is cancelledpursuant to this Notice. The Agency has determined that, for cancelled dinocap products, i.e., thoseproducts for which the registrant did not make the label changes requiredby this Notice, no further shipment, distribution, or sale of existingstocks will be permitted after 6 months from the publication date of thisNotice unless such products are stickered with the labeling required bythis Notice. Registrants may petition the Agency to allow the sale anddistribution of unstickered existing stocks. Such a petition should beaccompanied by risk and benefit data which the registrant believes wouldallow the Agency to determine that the benefits of use exceed the riskfor the duration of use of such stocks. The Agency is allowing 6 monthsfrom the date of this Notice before requiring cancelled products to bestickered in order to have an enforcement policy consistent with the provisionsprovided for products for which the registrant is making the label changesrequired by this Notice. In the event that all dinocap products subjectto this Notice are cancelled pursuant to this Notice, the Agency will notallow the sale and distribution of any existing stocks of these cancelledproducts from the date of cancellation unless such products are stickeredwith the label provisions required by this Notice. Dinocap products for which registrants are making the label changes requiredby this Notice may not be released for shipment, distributed or sold bya registrant 6 months from the publication date of this Notice unless suchproduct bears an amended label. Such dinocap products may not be distributedor sold by anyone else 6 months after the publication date of this Noticeunless such product bears the amended label <T3>or </T3>is stickered with the amended label. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Procedural Matters </ITAG>This Notice announces the Agency's determination to cancel all registrationsof products containing dinocap and deny registration to all applicationsto register products containing dinocap unless certain modifications aremade to the terms and conditions of registration. This Unit explains howregistrants may apply to amend their registrations for dinocap productsto comply with the terms and conditions discussed in Unit IV.A. of thisdocument. Under sections 6(b)(1) and 3(c)(6) of FIFRA, applicants, registrants,and certain other adversely affected parties may request a hearing on thecancellation and denial actions that this Notice initiates.
