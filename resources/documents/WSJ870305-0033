DorfmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PN LABORAIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pan American World Airways said it is sharply cutting its management staff and freezing salaries, and asked its labor unions to help cut labor costs 20%, or $180 million a year.    Pan Am and its unions have been in discussions for several weeks over possible steps to help the ailing airline.    The carrier said it is eliminating 464 management positions and freezing all management salaries, moves that it said will reduce payroll expense by approximately $30 million on an annual basis. An additional $50 million of other expenses under management control are also being eliminated, the company said.    After the job cuts, the company will have 1,935 management employees. The layoffs will take effect April 1, and employees will be notified by the end of next week.    The top two officers, Chairman C. Edward Acker and Vice Chairman Martin R. Shugrue, said they would demonstrate &quot;their personal commitment&quot; to reducing management costs by immediately taking a 20% pay cut.    Mr. Acker currently receives $500,000 a year and Mr. Shugrue $300,000, the company said; their proposed cuts would reduce Mr. Acker to $400,000 and Mr. Shugrue to $240,000.    A company spokeswoman said the proposals given the unions, together with the management cuts, would produce total annual savings of about $260 million.    &quot;It is imperative that we begin discussions immediately to obtain the maximum benefits for 1987,&quot; Mr. Shugrue told the Pan Am Joint Labor Council. The council represents four unions whose 20,000 members comprise pilots, flight engineers, flight attendants and clerical and other workers.    &quot;Management is leading the way, but with 40% of our operating expenses represented by labor costs, we must have the cooperation of our labor unions if we are to make additional improvements to our 1987 operating plan,&quot; he said. &quot;In today's competitive airline environment, it is essential that Pan Am bring its unit costs down to a level comparable with other major carriers.&quot;    Last month, the unions proposed wage and work-rule changes they said would save the airline as much as $600 million over the next three years, in exchange for an increased stake in the airline's parent company, Pan Am Corp. The company rejected the proposal, saying it wasn't in the best interest of shareholders and offered &quot;only temporary relief&quot; to its cost problems.    The four unions in the council said the management proposal showed that the company had &quot;begun to acknowledge the merit&quot; of the union's previous proposals.    But the union leaders cited several items that &quot;remain outstanding.&quot; These were &quot;the amount of common stock to be issued in exchange for the concessions, the numbers and availability of board seats, the form of employee protections, and possible management changes.&quot; However, the company said it hadn't offered any company stock or any job guarantees in its latest offer.    The unions said they were &quot;preparing a response for the company.&quot;    However, the union statement continued, &quot;even with concessions and other changes, there remains the question of whether the company has a business plan to insure its long-term profitability, particularly in light of TWA's proposal to acquire USAir.&quot; Trans World Airlines yesterday made a surprise bid to buy the shares of USAir Group Inc. it doesn't own for $52 each.    Thus, the unions said, &quot;until such time as the unions are satisfied that the company has a plan which will insure job security, the unions are continuing to seek a merger partner for Pan Am.&quot;    Pan Am has told employees it may be forced to sell its new Northeast shuttle operation in an effort to become profitable this year.    AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, recently said it wouldn't consider making an offer for Pan Am, but left open the possibility it might bid for some of Pan Am's assets.    For their part, the Pan Am unions have hired Rothschild Inc. as investment adviser to help find a buyer.    Mr. Acker, Pan Am's Chairman, has said Pan Am Corp. will report a net loss of more than $400 million for 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
