ClaraBarton, for instance, might never have founded the American Red Cross,and her counterparts in other countries might never have founded sistersocieties. Life would truly have been different in our land for peoplewho needed blood, or evacuees left homeless by floods, or accident victims,or countless others. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">A century and a quarter after Solferino, we have real reason to celebratethe victory for humanity and for international cooperation that sprangfrom that battlefield. Today, 145 national societies of the InternationalRed Cross offer help without regard to race, creed, cause, or nationality.Like many of these societies, the American Red Cross provides assistanceon several fronts, including health and safety, disaster relief, blood,and social services. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Every day, the American Red Cross battles the devastation left bynatural disasters. Last year, the Red Cross clothed, fed, or sheltered450,000 disaster victims, and through the generosity of the American peopleit provided individuals with $122 million in disaster relief. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Red Cross also assists military personnel, last year alone helpingmembers of the Armed Forces and their families 2.5 million times. Dailyit relays 4,000 messages of birth, death, and illness to military postsworldwide. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The American Red Cross battles potential threats to the blood supplyby collecting, and testing for disease, more than half of our Nation'sblood supply. Last year, four million volunteers donated blood to the RedCross, restoring life and health to millions of blood recipients. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Red Cross also fights hazards to health and safety by trainingin cardiopulmonary resuscitation, first aid, swimming, water and boatingsafety, and preparation for parenthood and babysitting. Last year, sevenmillion Americans successfully completed Red Cross courses. Last year,Red Cross chapters also distributed 67 million AIDS brochures and urgedthe public ``to get the facts.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Red Cross also combats social and economic problems; it helpsyoung mothers, assists the aged, the homeless, and the destitute, and helpsimmigrants learn English. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These are some of the reasons we all rejoice in the vision and themission of the American Red Cross, especially in this 125th anniversaryyear of the International Red Cross. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States ofAmerica and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, by virtueof the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the UnitedStates, do hereby proclaim the month of March 1988 as American Red CrossMonth. I urge all Americans to continue their generous support and readyassistance to the work of the American Red Cross and its more than 2,800chapters, 1.4 million adult members, and three million youth volunteers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighthday of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight,and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredand twelfth. <ITAG tagnum="65">andPres; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">[FR Doc. 88-2160 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Filed 1-29-88; 10:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="50">Billing code 3195-01-M<FTAG tagnum="4705"/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">American Red Cross Month, 1988</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
