The fighting broke out Saturday night and lasted into earlySunday in the Black Sea city of Sukhumi, capital of the AbkhazianAutonomous Republic, Tass said. The region is administered byGeorgia.   Said Tarkil, ideology secretary for Abkhazia, said Abkhazianswere protesting a decision by the Georgian government to restrictthe number of Abkhazians enrolled at the city's branch of TbilisiState University.   Abkhazians, outnumbered by both Georgians and Russians in theirhomeland, have protested alleged discriminiation in the past.   Georgia also decided to separate the Sukhumi branch from theother campuses, Tarkil said in a telephone interview from Sukhumi,900 miles south of Moscow.   ``The Abkhazian side is against this. It is inadmissable todivide a university according to nationalities,'' Tarkil said,adding that a commission from the national parliament also opposedthe division of the university.   Tarkil said that the fighting raged over a large part of the cityand involved not only students, ``but all segments of thepopulation.''   The Tass report said ``measures are being taken to render help tothose wounded, to restore public order and tranquility. Thesituation is now being controlled by police and troops of theInterior Ministry,'' which runs the national police force.   Tass said Sunday that 11 people died and 127 were hurt in theweekend fighting. It did not specify the nationalities of thevictims or give their names. The Georgian news agency Gruzinformtoday said the death toll was at 14.   ``In the clashes, stones, sticks, firearms and cold steel wereused,'' said a joint report by Tass and Grunzinform.   Gruzinform said police and military units were patrolling thecity and adjoining areas. ``The situation is tense,'' an employee ofthe news agency said in a telephone call.   The senior official in Georgia, Communist Party First SecretaryGivi Gumaridze, rushed to Abkhazia along with law enforcementofficials seeking to restore order.   Party and government officials ``appealed to the population to berational and responsible and assist law enforcement authorities instabilizing the situation,'' the report said.   Abkhazia, a region of 535,000 people, lies along the Black Seacoast in the Caucasus Mountains of the southern Soviet Union,adjacent Turkey. Abkhazians in the region number 91,000.   The weekend fighting is the latest in a series of ethnic disputesand other unrest since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985,bringing a greater tolerance of dissent.   The ruling Communist Party's Central Committee is to meetsometime this month to discuss the nationalist problems that haveaccompanied Gorbachev's reforms.   In March, demands by Abkhazians for independence sparked clasheswith Georgians and led to nationalist rallies by Georgians in therepublic's capital, Tbilisi.   In April, 20 people were killed when troops armed with sharpenedshovels crushed a pro-independence rally in Tbilisi. That incidentis under investigation by a commission of the national parliament.   The neighboring republic of Azerbaijan and the Nagorno-KarabakhAutonomous Republic also have been the scenes of bloody ethnicclashes, as have the republics of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan inrecent weeks.   In Uzbekistan, Uzbeks attacked minority Meskhi Turks in late Mayand early June, killing 100 people. The minority was resettled therefrom Georgia during Stalin's rule.   Native residents in Kazakhstan rioted against ethnic groups fromthe Caucasus mountains in June. They complained the settlersreceived preferential treatment in housing and other benefits.   Like the largely Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, whichis seeking to be free of administrative control of Azerbaijan, theAbkhazians have been seeking autonomy from Georgia.   Nagorno-Karabakh has been placed under the administrative controlof Moscow, but Abkhazia is still administered by Georgia.</TEXT></DOC>
