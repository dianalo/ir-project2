He also acceptedthe argument that steep tobacco-consumption declines inCanada in recent years are due to sharply higher taxes andchanges in public attitudes rather than the ad ban. A pack of20 cigarettes in Canada now costs about (US)$4.50, twice asmuch as in the U.S.   On a separate point, Judge Chabot ruled that the federalad ban also is unconstitutional because it infringes on thejurisdiction of Canada's provinces.   Tobacco companies and anti-smoking groups here said thiswas the first successful legal challenge of such a ban thatthey know of. They said the ruling could have a broad impactoutside Canada. Several countries already have or areconsidering tobacco-ad bans. The European Community hasproposed one that would apply across the 12-nation EC. Canadais widely seen as a model for governments trying to reducesmoking through a combination of regulation and taxation.   U.S. tobacco and food concern RJR Nabisco Holdings &quot;wasvery interested in the trial,&quot; said Colin K. Irving, anattorney for the company's Toronto-based RJR-Macdonald Inc.unit. &quot;They feel the Canadian judgment could have an impactin the U.S. and elsewhere.&quot;   RJR-Macdonald and Imperial Tobacco Ltd., a unit ofMontreal-based Imasco, filed separate challenges to the adban. The suits were heard together before Judge Chabot. &quot;I'msure it will have an effect&quot; on the EC's proposed ban, saidSimon V. Potter, an attorney for Imperial Tobacco.   &quot;I think {the ruling} will be used by the tobacco industryto intimidate other governments,&quot; said Andreas Seibert, apolicy analyst with the Canadian Council on Smoking andHealth. The anti-smoking group and the Canadian CancerSociety both said they were &quot;appalled&quot; by the court decisionand urged the Canadian government to appeal the ruling.   Canadian Health Minister Benoit Bouchard said he was&quot;disappointed&quot; by the ruling. He said the government willstudy the judgment over the next few days to decide whataction to take. Judge Chabot and the tobacco companies expectthe case will eventually end up in the Supreme Court ofCanada.   It isn't clear whether the ad ban would remain in effectpending an appeal. Imperial Tobacco and RJR-Macdonald insistthat the ban is dead unless and until a higher court reversesJudge Chabot's ruling.   Imperial and RJR-Macdonald said they will beginadvertising again but said it's too early to tell exactlywhen, or how much they will spend. The Canadian TobaccoManufacturers' Council said the industry is prepared todiscuss some voluntary restrictions on tobacco advertisingwith the government. Canadian tobacco companies stoppedtelevision and radio advertising voluntarily in 1972.   Imperial, RJR-Macdonald and Rothmans, Benson andamp; Hedges Inc.together hold about 98% of the Canadian cigarette market.Rothmans, Benson andamp; Hedges is 40%-owned by Philip Morris and60%-owned by Rothmans of Toronto, which is in turn 71%-ownedby Rothmans International.   Before the ad ban took effect Jan. 1, 1989, tobaccocompanies were spending about 88 million Canadian dollars(US$76 million) a year on advertising. &quot;It was a real nicepiece of business,&quot; said Peter Greene, president and chiefexecutive of Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Compton Hayhurst Ltd. inToronto. The agency and its predecessor firms have held theRothmans, Benson andamp; Hedges account for 30 years. Since theban, they've done consulting work for Rothmans.   Mr. Greene said the tobacco companies will probably treadsoftly if Judge Chabot's ruling stands. &quot;I would be surprisedto see terribly aggressive marketing,&quot; Mr. Greene said. &quot;Youreally wouldn't want to push too hard.&quot;   Magazine executive Jean Pare hailed the ruling. &quot;Cigaretteads never forced anybody to smoke,&quot; Mr. Pare said. Before theban, tobacco advertising represented 3% to 4%, or aboutC$300,000 to C$400,000, of annual ad revenue at L'actualite,one of the magazines he runs as president of the Quebecdivision of Maclean Hunter Ltd., a Toronto publishingconcern. Magazine publishers were particularly incensed bythe ad ban because U.S. magazines account for 65% of magazinesales in Canada, and they're loaded with cigarette ads; theban doesn't apply to foreign publications.   &quot;This is an historic judgment,&quot; said Mr. Potter, theImperial Tobacco lawyer. He said it means &quot;the state can'tdictate what you can hear, see or read about a legalproduct.&quot; Even if tobacco is a danger to public health, JudgeChabot said, &quot;There isn't any proof that advertising itselfis a danger to public health. As Aristotle said, the word`dog' never bit anyone.&quot;                                                                                                          GSDandamp;M Wins Clouded Pitch                                                                                                          GSDandamp;M emerged the clear winner in the competition for theestimated $20 million Candamp;S/Sovran bank account -- or did it?   The Austin, Texas, agency won the big Southeastern bank'saccount on Friday -- just four days after Candamp;S/Sovran formallyagreed to merge with NCNB Corp. Now it is unclear whetherGSDandamp;M will hold onto its new client after the merger. Theshop must go head-to-head against Bozell's Dallas office,which handles the estimated $30 million NCNB account.   Such a predicament is a bit ironic for both agencies.Candamp;S/Sovran's review resulted from the merger last year of twoother banks, Citizens andamp; Southern Corp. and Sovran FinancialCorp. And Bozell won the combined NCNB business only lastyear after a shoot-out with Atlanta agency McKinney andamp; Silver.That competition stemmed from NCNB's merger of its Texasunit, handled by Bozell, with its Charlotte, N.C.-based mainoperations, handled by McKinney andamp; Silver.   The announcement also comes less than two weeks after aproposed merger of Chemical Banking and Manufacturers Hanoverraised the possibility that they, too, will consolidate theirad accounts. Chemical's major agency, Della Femina McNamee,and Manufacturers' main agency, McCann-Erickson, would be thetop contenders for the combined account.   Candamp;S/Sovran said its agreement with GSDandamp;M &quot;will be deferred. . . in light of the pending merger with NCNB.&quot; But the twobanks' advertising will probably be combined eventually --and industry executives said Bozell stands a better shot atwinning the account for the merged bank, to be known asNationsBank. NCNB initiated the merger talks and is seen asthe stronger of the two partners.   But it could take as long as three years for the banks tofully combine their operations, and a decision on advertising&quot;could be as far down the road as 1994,&quot; an NCNB spokesmansaid.   In winning the Candamp;S/Sovran account, GSDandamp;M beat out theincumbents -- WPP Group's Ogilvy andamp; Mather and Earle PalmerBrown -- as well as much bigger agencies including finalistsYoung andamp; Rubicam and Omnicom Group's DDB Needham unit. Despitethe account's clouded future, GSDandamp;M President Roy Spencesaid, &quot;I'm just celebrating the fact that we took on the bigboys and kicked butt.&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          CONSOLIDATION: Northern Telecom, a unit of Canada's BCE,will consolidate its estimated $12 million ad account, nowsplit between Backer Spielvogel Bates and J. Walter Thompson,at Thompson by year's end, executives close to the accountsaid. Thompson, a unit of WPP Group, has handled the largerU.S. product advertising assignment for the maker oftelecommunications equipment. Backer, a unit of Saatchi andamp;Saatchi Co., has done corporate-image work as well asEuropean advertising for Northern Telecom, with billings inthe $3 million range, the executives said.                                                                                                          BATTERIES: Duracell denied speculation that its adaccount, now handled by WPP unit Ogilvy andamp; Mather, was beingreviewed. The agency couldn't be reached for comment. Ads forthe battery maker, which spent $50 million last year onadvertising according to tracking service Leading NationalAdvertisers, have been overshadowed by the Energizer bunnycampaign from rival Eveready, a unit of Ralston Purina.                                                                                                          WHO'S NEWS: John R. Blaney was named executive director ofworld-wide clients, a new post, at Ogilvy andamp; Mather. Mr.Blaney continues in his current post as world-wide managementsupervisor on the agency's Unilever account.</TEXT></DOC>
