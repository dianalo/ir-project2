After moving sideways in light activity for more than three months, bond prices have had wide swings lately, much to the delight of many bond traders. &quot;It's great to see volatility back again,&quot; says Alan Bozian, a first vice president of Union Bank of Switzerland. &quot;It's very hard to make money when the market is stable.&quot;    The dollar's sharp drop in the foreign-exchange markets dominated the credit markets for much of last week, helping to propel bond prices sharply lower Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. But the mood quickly changed Friday after a Labor Department report indicated that the economy isn't growing as rapidly as analysts had thought.    While many traders contend that the dollar remains shaky, the Labor Department figures have aroused renewed hope for lower interest rates in coming weeks. The number of workers on nonfarm payrolls rose only 164,000 last month, well below the 225,000 to 230,000 increase that many forecasters had expected. Moreover, the department revised its February estimate to a 236,000 increase from its original estimate of 337,000.    The jobs report indicated the economy &quot;ended the quarter on a gloomy note, with a likelihood for weakness in the second quarter,&quot; said Lawrence N. Leuzzi, managing director and economist at S.G. Warburg Securities Inc. He expects interest rates &quot;to zigzag lower as a function of this economic weakness we see.&quot;    But a report being issued today by the National Association of Purchasing Management is likely to create additional uncertainty about the economy's prospects and may lead to even more volatility in the credit markets. The association said a survey of purchasing managers at 250 industrial companies indicates that the industrial economy &quot;continued its growth in March at an improved rate over February.&quot;    Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee, said he is &quot;very surprised&quot; at the apparent discrepancy between the association's survey results and the Labor Department report Friday. &quot;About all I can offer is that I am a big believer in our numbers,&quot; he said. He said those numbers indicate that the industrial economy ended the first quarter with &quot;healthy, if not substantial, improvement,&quot; and that &quot;the sharp rise in the growth of new orders assures a good beginning for the second quarter.&quot;    Nevertheless, the Labor Department report was &quot;exceedingly weak,&quot; said Charles Lieberman, senior vice president and director of financial markets research at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. &quot;These numbers indicate the economy is performing badly.&quot; In view of economic &quot;weakness&quot; in many foreign nations, &quot;The implication is that interest rates probably should decline on a global basis,&quot; he contended.    Mr. Lieberman predicted that the yield on the Treasury's latest 30-year bonds will drop back to about 7 1/2% &quot;fairly quickly.&quot; The issue yielded 7.86% late Friday after having surged to 7.94% Thursday. As recently as March 26, its yield was 7.55%, which was little changed from the 7.49% level as of Dec. 31.    The Labor Department report &quot;increases the chance we could see rates come down again in the next few months,&quot; said Robert H. Chandross, vice president and chief economist of Lloyds Bank in New York. &quot;What looked like a rebound in the U.S. economy (earlier this year) is petering out.&quot;    The Labor Department report, combined with prospects for &quot;slow&quot; growth in West Germany and Japan, &quot;creates an environment in which central bankers and finance ministers could feel compelled to take stronger action to stimulate world economic growth,&quot; Mr. Chandross contended. &quot;The possibility of another round of coordinated cuts in interest rates by central banks is very real,&quot; he said.    Despite Friday's rally in the bond market, prices still wound up the week well below where they began, and there still is widespread apprehension about the dollar's fate in the currency markets. Investment managers fear that a lower dollar would mean higher inflation in the U.S. as prices of imports rise and thus would discourage the Federal Reserve from easing credit conditions. Also, if the dollar falls further, foreign investors may shun U.S. securities, leading to higher interest rates.    &quot;The dollar's decline, exacerbated by the announcement of retaliatory trade action by the U.S. against Japan, represents a challenge to recent international accords and raised the specter of inflation,&quot; said Henry Kaufman, chief economist of Salomon Brothers Inc. In the latest issue of his weekly publication, &quot;Comments on Credit,&quot; he said the bond markets remain &quot;highly sensitized&quot; to movements in the dollar.    ---   Friday's Bond Activity   Bond prices surged after the Labor Department reported an unexpectedly small increase in the number of workers on business payrolls last month and lowered its February figure sharply. Some actively traded Treasury issues jumped seven-eighths of a point, or $8.75 for each $1,000 face amount, erasing similar declines Thursday.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 rose to 95 27/32 from 94 31/32 Thursday, while the yield fell to 7.86% from 7.94%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 climbed to 98 from 97 10/32, as the yield declined to 7.54% from 7.65%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. rose 7.44 points Friday to close at 1382.74. It ranged between 1374.94 and 1387.21.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills declined. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills fell to 5.50% bid from 5.51% Thursday, while the latest six-month bills fell to 5.70% bid from 5.80%.    Major banks last week raised their prime lending rate to 7 3/4% from 7 1/2%, a move initiated Tuesday by Citibank and followed quickly by Chase Manhattan Bank. The prime rate, which is used by banks as a base for rates on loans to many small and medium-sized businesses as well as on numerous types of consumer loans, had stood at 7 1/2% since August. </TEXT></DOC>
