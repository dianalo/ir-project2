In the studies, 24 psychologists argued that childrens'testimony must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, ratherthan categorized either as totally useless or as completelyreliable, as the judicial system has tended to do.</LP><TEXT>   Many of the conclusions of the studies, collected in avolume titled &quot;The Suggestibility of Children'sRecollections: Implications for Eyewitness Testimony,&quot; arecontradictory. But the researchers agree that even thoughchildren can provide key testimony in child abuse and othercases, they can also easily be manipulated by lawyers. Theysay that a child's testimony can be affected by stress orlong delays between an event and a court appearance.   &quot;For too many years, people have accepted the simplisticslogan `Children don't lie,'&quot; said Douglas Besharov, formerdirector of the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect.&quot;Some children lie and some don't. Some fantasize and somedon't. This volume will help everyone involved in thelitigation process understand the complexity of these casesand the need for sophisticated and unbiased professionalanalysis of child testimony.&quot;   In interviews, psychologists who participated in thestudies said that extensive training was necessary forlawyers, police officers and other professionals whointerview children. They recommended the followingguidelines:   -- Ask open-ended questions to elicit as much informationas possible, and avoid detailed yes/no questions, which putwords into a child's mouth.   -- Make sure children understand questions. In one study,children said &quot;yes&quot; when asked if a researcher had touchedtheir &quot;private parts&quot; -- but when asked to point to thoseparts, they touched their ears and arms.   -- Avoid repeating questions; harping on one aspect of astory tends to reduce a child's confidence in his answers.   -- Question children in a non-threatening environment.Allow them to testify in court with one-way mirrors so theydon't have to confront their alleged attackers face-to-face.   While calling for standard procedures for interviewingchild witnesses, the researchers acknowledged thatprofessionals must remain flexible. Concluded Marc Lindberg,a psychology professor at Marshall University in Huntington,W.Va.: &quot;We can't give a recipe of how to squeeze the truthout of a young kid.&quot;   ---   PLAGIARISM VERDICT for TV miniseries theme music is setaside.   Ruling that he may have erred in instructing the jury, afederal judge in Los Angeles ordered a new trial in a casethat pitted an amateur composer against Paramount Picturesover rights to the musical theme from &quot;The Winds of War.&quot;   The studio, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc.,produced the miniseries, which was broadcast on the ABCtelevision network in 1983. A jury ruled that JohnWoodbridge, of Deerfield, Ill., who said he composed themusic, could share some of the show's revenue earned byParamount and co-defendant Capital Cities/ABC Inc.   Judge David V. Kenyon said he may have confused the jurorswhen he gave them the legal definition of &quot;substantialsimilarity,&quot; which must be proved in such cases.   Michael Polin, a Los Angeles attorney for Mr. Woodbridge,said the ruling was a surprise because it wasn't related tothe most controversial issue in the case -- whether Paramounthad access to the material it allegedly copied. &quot;The jurycouldn't have cared less about the jury instruction onsubstantial similarity, because they were given plenty ofother instructions,&quot; he said.   A spokesman for Paramount said the studio is &quot;delightedthat the judge decided to grant a new trial.&quot;   ---   PINK SLIP guidelines are issued by New York barassociation.   Big law firms in New York City, hit hard by the recession,have fired hundreds of lawyers to cut costs. But Conrad K.Harper, president of the Association of the Bar of the Cityof New York, said that many law firms have &quot;not been candid&quot;with young lawyers and have issued public statements that thelawyers were being axed because of poor job performance.   &quot;The stigma of being fired the first year after law schoolcould haunt lawyers for the rest of their lives,&quot; Mr. Harpersaid.   The bar recently sent letters to the city's law firmssuggesting that they should &quot;not state or imply that atermination caused essentially by economic considerations wasbased on performance evaluations.&quot; The bar also said lawfirms should give fired lawyers no fewer than three monthsnotice and offer them free support services.   The bar association has no authority to punish firms thatfail to follow the guidelines, Mr. Harper said.   ---   NOTED: Edwin I.
