Israeli officials claim some gangs operate under direct order ofthe PLO. But Palestinians maintain that at least some of themurders have been carried out in defiance of PLO Chairman YasserArafat.   With 132 Palestinians killed for alleged collaboration in the22-month-old Palestinian uprising, there are fears that theexecutions are getting out of hand. Palestinians complain thatordinary citizens are being intimidated by the frequent murders.   In Nablus last week, the Red Eagles killed a 24-year-oldupholstery worker and wheeled his body through the streets of theWest Bank's largest city in a pushcart, presumably as a warning toothers.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, a school guard was found burned todeath in his car Oct. 5 and graffiti signed by the ``PalestinianRevolutionary Eagles'' took responsibility the slaying.   A senior Israeli defense official on Tuesday confirmed a reportin The New York Times that security forces had discovered documentslinking the Revolutionary Eagles in Gaza to Yasser Arafat'smainstream PLO faction Fatah.   One letter quoted by the Times says slayings should be blamed onthe little-known Eagles group in order to deflect blame from thePLO.   The Times said, however, that the documents could be forgeries.If genuine, the papers could give credence to Israel's repeatedarguments that Arafat is sponsoring murder despite his claim tohave renounced terrorism in December.   Israeli officials have frequently cited the slayings ofPalestinians by fellow Arabs as reason for the United States tohalt its dialogue with the PLO, begun after Arafat's statement onterrorism.   The pace of the killings has quickened as the uprising hasdragged on without political gains. Of the 132 slayings byPalestinians since the revolt erupted in December 1987, 110occurred this year alone.   At least 601 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiersor civilians during the revolt, and 40 Israelis also have died.   Palestinian sources say the murders of some supposedcollaborators claimed by such groups as the Abu Jihad Phalangistsare ordered by opponents of Arafat's policies.   The Red Eagles in Nablus are believed backed by the PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical Syrian-based PLOfaction that opposes Arafat's efforts to negotiate an agreementwith Israel.   In Nablus, residents of the Yasmina quarter where the BlackPanthers operate say the gang is murdering people despite appealsfrom PLO-backed uprising leaders and Arafat himself.   They say the gang's members, believed to be 10 men ages 19 to25, wander freely through the dark, twisting alleys of Yasmina,often armed with knives, hatchets or pistols.   ``People are scared to death,'' a 32-year-old Yasmina shopkeepersaid. ``They are afraid to leave their houses.''   The shopkeeper, like others who agreed to discuss the BlackPanther slayings, would not allow his name to be used out of fear.   Nablus residents and local journalists said the Black Panthershave carried out 15 or 16 of the 20 slayings in the city, most ofalleged collaborators but also including prostitutes and drugdealers who some activists consider enemies of the uprising.   The Black Panthers are allied with Arafat's Fatah PLO faction,but local Fatah officials say the gang's members are running out ofcontrol, ignoring orders in uprising leaflets that any killingsmust have the approval of the revolt's leaders.   ``They are not educated enough to be judges. They are workingagainst the intefadeh,'' said one Fatah leader in Nablus.   Two weeks ago, residents listened carefully to an appeal fromArafat on the PLO's radio station in Iraq urging more control inslayings of collaborators. They say the statement was clearly aimedat the Black Panthers.   Neither Arafat nor uprising leaders have condemned collaboratorkillings outright, however, and there is widespread support forkilling Palestinians who endanger the lives of activists byinforming on them.   Arafat, in an interview early this month with a London-basedArabic-language newspaper, said he gave authority to uprisingleaders to order murders of those proven to be collaborators.   ``The unified command has the right to kill all those whocooperate with the enemy,'' he told the Al-Quds Al-Arabia.</TEXT></DOC>
