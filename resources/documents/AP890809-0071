A statement released by the party's information center said theJuly 28 kidnapping of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and two relatives wasa ``terrorist crime of piracy.''   Israel has offered to trade Obeid and all Shiite prisoners itholds for three Israeli servicemen and the 16 Western hostages heldin Lebanon.   ``The Zionist enemy has suffered a bitter dismay because of hisfailure to achieve his objectives from the crime of abducting SheikObeid,'' Hezbollah said.   ``It is clear that things have backfired adversely on the enemyafter this foolish crime. It has become impossible to release theIsraeli POWs and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked,''it said.   ``Moreover, the refusal of the enemy to release Sheik Obeid andhis two relatives, and his linkage of the problem of the ZionistPOWs with that of the hostages might hurt the West and furthercomplicate the hostage issue,'' the statement added.   Hezbollah, Iran's main ally in Lebanon, is believed to be theumbrella group for extremist factions holding most of the hostages.   ``We contend that past efforts for the release of the Westernhostages in Lebanon is passing through the greatest setback becauseof the foolhardiness committed by the racist Zionists, who appearperfectly willing to sacrfice all others for their selfishinterests,'' the statement said.   It repeated its urging that the West pressure Israel to freeObeid.   Israeli officials have said Obeid admitted under interrogationthat he took part in planning terrorist attacks, including theabduction of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in southLebanon Feb. 17, 1988.   Hezbollah said Israel is lying about the reported confessions.   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, an extemist groupmade up of pro-Iranian zealots, said July 31 that it had hangedHiggins in retaliation for Israel's refusal to free Obeid.   Higgins, 44, commanded a 76-man observer unit attached to theU.N. Peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he was kidnapped.   There are eight Americans among the 16 hostages in Lebanon. Thehostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
