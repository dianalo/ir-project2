LAN, and a new industry was born.andO;By 1988, over 2 million new computers were being connected to the Etherneteach year.andP;  Other &quot;standard&quot; LAN technologies have emerged as well, and eventhreaten to outstrip Ethernet in terms of nodes shipped.andP;  The firstgeneration of networking is a reality.andM;Originally expected to support relatively high-performance systems, thefirst-generation LAN has found its greatest market in connecting personalcomputers and workstations.andP;  The PC LAN business has been growing veryrapidly; market seers predict that by 1990 the industry will ship over 5.5million networked PCs.andM;First-Generation LANs are characterized by signaling rates in the range of 1to 10 MB per second; copper-based media; VLSI implementations of physical anddatalink layers; and ill-defined network management standards.andP;  They providebasic services (file transfer, electronic mail, and the like) for PC-classequipment, and also facilitate access to shared resources.andP;  They have proveninadequate, however, in meeting the many higher-performance requirements ofengineering workstations, graphics modeling systems, mini-computers, andother UNIX-dominated environments.andM;With the first generation firmly established, LANs are maturing and becomingmore functional.andP;  Services and applications have evolved--first to takeadvantage of the increased link bandwidth, and then to create newcapabilities.andP;  The development of LAN technology is itself driven by advancesin other fields.andP;  Representatives at ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories report thatphysical signaling rates are doubling every 14 months (in the lab), andindustry analysts report that comute power is doubling every 12 months.andP;  As aresult of dramatic progress on several fronts, there is incredible pressureon the industry to supply higher-performance networks that move data at leastan order of magnitude faster than Ethernet, while maintaining theinter-networking environment developed during the first generation.andM;Early in 1983, even before the earliest Ethernet chip sets were indistribution, work was started on the first example of second-generationpublic LANs--the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).andP;  FDDI has been indevelopment for the past five years as a project of the X3T9.5 TechnicalWorking Group under the X3 Accredited Standards Committee of the AmericanNational Standards Institute (ANSI).andP;  In recent years, the X3T9 standardscommittee and its subcommittees have developed and standardized interfacessuch as SCSI, IPI, and the streaming tape interfaces.andP;  The X3T9.5 membershiporiginally consisted of representatives of manufacturers interested indeveloping a high-bandwidth serial &quot;channel&quot; interface for mainframes.andM;In 1983 work was completed on the Locally Distributed Data Interface (LDDI),a 50 MB-per-second &quot;channel-like&quot; interface loosely based on Control DataCorp.'s Loosely Coupled Network (LCN).andP;  LDDI was a broadband network thatsupported seven nodes and could physically connect systems over a totaldistance of 1 kilometer.andP;  It was obvious even then that higher bandwidth wasnecessary and that the connectable number of nodes should be on the order ofhundreds or even thousands.andP;  The goal was to extend the communications on thecomputer floor, to allow disk drives to be located significantly farther fromthe mainframe, and to support distributed multiprocessor computingenvironments.andM;The FDDI is the first standard LAN that specifies the use of optical fiber asit primary media.andP;  FDDI's data-transfer rate of 100 MB per second is an orderof magnitude faster than Ethernet's.andP;  Its bit error rate (BER) isapproximately six orders of magnitude better, and its ability to support upto 1000 connections--at distances of up to 2 kilometers between networknodes--shows that it's more extensible.andP;  For these reasons and a host ofothers, FDDI has become a focal point for the optical fiber industry and ashowcase for technology now available.andM;FDDI provides layered data services, with specifically identifiedinterdependencies.andP;  The layering in FDDI conforms to the InternationalStandards Organization (ISO) Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection(OSI).andP;  Like earlier standards, FDDI deals only with the Physical and DataLink Layers, the lowest two in the model (see Figure 1).andM;The FDDI standard is contained in five separate but interrelated documentsthat follow the early lead of the IEEE 802 standard, which subdivides the OSIlayers.andP;  The OSI Physical Layer is described in two separate documents: theFDDI Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) Document describes those attributes ofthe physical layer that are solely dependent on the optical fiber mediaselected; the FDDI Physical Layer Protocol (PHY) Document describes theencoding, decoding, and non-media-dependent requirements of the FDDI PhysicalLayer.andM;The FDDI Data Link Layer is subdivided into Media Access Control (MAC) andLogical Link Control (LLC) sublayers.andP;  FDDI does not specify LLC, butexplicitly supports the use of both standard (IEEE 802.2) and non-standard oruser-defined LLC protocols.andP;  FDDI fits the 802 model (see Figure 2).andP;  Becauseof this attribute and FDDI's high bandwidth, it is the ideal choice for useas a backbone network to interconnect 802 standard LANs in a campusenvironment or within a business or research facility.andM;The fifth document is Station Management (SMT), which provides the controlnecessary at the station level to manage processes in the FDDI layers, sothat a station may work cooperatively on the ring.andP;  It provides services suchas station insertion and removal, station initialization, fault isolation andrecovery, scheduling policies, and collection of station statistics.andM;Media Access Control.andP;  The FDDI MAC provides a data service similar to theIEEE 802.5 token ring.andP;  Three types of packet data services--SMT, LLC, andimplementor--are defined.andP;  Each MAC provides SMT data service, and MACs inpeer and slave stations normally provide all data services.andP;  Data packets areconveyed in frames, and each frame is explicitly labeled with its packettype.andP;  Labeling limits vulnerability to inadvertent or deliberateinterference among data services coexisting in the same ring.andM;The FDDI LLC frame format is compatible with IEEE 802.2 LLC, and supports allhigher-layer protocols supported by LLC.andP;  Alternatives to the standard LLCmay be more efficient for specific applications (such as packet voice) or maybe desirable for support of nonstandard, higher-layer protocols.andP;  Explicitimplementor frame types are provided to permit proprietary implementations tocoexist and to prevent interference with future MAC extensions.andP;  In addition,frame types are reserved for future standardization.andM;The FDDI MAC uses a timed token protocol for ring scheduling.andP;  This protocolprovides three classes of service: synchronous, restricted asynchronous, andpriority asynchronous.andP;  Synchronous service guarantees both throughput andresponse-time limits to one or more concurrent users.andP;  Synchronous bandwidthis allocated in advance using the SMT protocol, and is dynamically assignedby the MAC protocol.andP;  Unused synchronous bandwidth is allocated to theasynchronous services on the ring.andP;  Restricted asynchronous serviceguarantees both throughput and response-time limits for one extended dialog(burst-mode transmission) at a time.andP;  Restricted bandwidth is dynamicallyallocated and assigned by the MAC protocol, and any unused restrictedbandwidth is wasted.andM;Priority asynchronous service is FDDI's normal mode of access.andP;  It supportsmultiple, independently programmable priorities (with arbitrary granularity),and provides fair distribution of throughput and response time among users ateach priority level.andP;  Priority bandwidth is dynamically allocated andassigned by the MAC protocol.andP;  Unused bandwidth at one priority level isavailable to lower-priority users.andP;  This service operates more efficiently asthe offered load increases, although response time deteriorates.andM;The FDDI MAC is a published ANSI standard, and at present is an approved ISOstandard.andP;  It is being edited for ISO publication.andM;Physical Layer Protocol.andP;  The FDDI PHY implements full-duplex physicalconnections.andP;  A physical connection consists of a pair of physical links eachon a separate, counter-rotating FDDI ring.andP;  Each connection existsindependent of other connections in the network.andP;  This provides for automatictransmission system (PMD) fault isolation, and permits concurrentinitialization of all working connections.andM;The FDDI PHY uses a group code for transmitting both data and controlsignals.andP;  This code represents each data quartet (4 bits) as a unique symbol.andO;Data and control symbols are encoded as groups of (5-baud) intervals, so thecode is called a 4b/5b code (with a run length of 3).andP;  The code has a nominalbandwidth of 125 megabits per second, which achieves a data rate of 100megabits per second, or 800 percent efficiency (the nominal efficiency of aManchester code, by comparison, is 50 percent).andP;  In addition to the dataquartets, the code provides a unique starting delimiter sequence to establishthe framing boundary, a robust set of control indicators for MAC, and a setof line states for physical connection management.andM;Elasticity is required in any ring of non-trivial size, because it isimpractical to hold constant the physical propagation delay of a ring.andP;  Givena variable propagation delay, it follows that the number of bits in the ring,the frequency of the bits, or both of these, will also vary.andP;  To maintainring continuity, the number of usable bits entering and leaving any stationmust be kept equal.andP;  The mechanism to compensate for short-term variations inthe frequency of the ring is called an elasticity buffer.andP;  The amount ofelasticity required is a function of the maximum drift between those stations(in space and time), where the number of bits can be adjusted.andP;  Low-speedrings with a limited number of stations can operate with widely separatedadjustment points.andP;  The IEEE 802.5 (IBM) ring, for example, has elasticity atone station and adjustment is possible only when a token arives.andP;  Anotherproprietary token ring--Apollo's Domain Network--has a nominal amount ofelasticity in each station.andM;In FDDI, each PHY entity has enough elasticity to absorb the maximumvariation within a frame.andP;  This elasticity buffer is adjusted during thepreamble time between frames.andP;  Both the required and the available ringelasticity are scaled according to the number of PHY entities in the ring.andO;To ensure stable ring operation, a smoothing function minimizes thecumulative effects of sampling and quantizing errors across multiplestations.andP;  The FDDI elasticity buffer operates independent of the physical orlogical topology, and permits flexibility in the design of the clockingsystem within individual stations.andM;Each FDDI physical link has a continuously clocked signaling stream.andO;Multiple links may be driven from a common clock, or each link may beindependently clocked.andP;  Any clock source that meets minimum accuracy andjitter requirements may be used.andP;  The required long-term accuracy is 50 partsper million (including maximum variation due to temperature, voltage, andaging).andP;  Each station is permitted to have a stable, independent frequencyreference.andP;  This promotes stable transmitter and receiver operation on eachlink and prevents jitter accumulation across multiple links.andP;  Multiple linkscan be initialized concurrently, independent of the network configuration.andO;The FDDI clocking system simplifies clock distribution within stations, clockfault isolation, and specification of clocking in the standard.andM;The FDDI PHY has been approved as an ANSI standard and was recentlypublished.andP;  PHY is also an approved ISO standard, and is being edited for ISOpublication.andM;Physical Layer Medium Dependent.andP;  The FDDI PMD uses a light-emitting diode(LED) optical transmitter, operating at a wavelength of approximately 1300nanometers over multimode-graded index fiber.andP;  This fiber propagates lightalong multiple paths or modes, with the delays along all paths matches so asto limit signal dispersion.andP;  PMD specifies a maximum optical attenuation of11.0 dB, and a minimum fiber bandwidth of 250 MHz.andP;  Within thesespecifications, multiple (or even mixed) fiber sizes are permitted with linklengths of up to 2 kilometers (assuming 500 MHz/km fiber).andP;  The maximum linkbit error rate is one bit in 2.5x10.sup.10 at maximum attenuation and minimumbandwidth, with error rates below 10.sup.12 expected in normal operation.andM;The FDDI PMD uses a duplex Media Interface Connector (MIC), which is designedto be used by untrained personnel in an office or campus environment.andP;  Itincorporates polarization and keying to prevent incorrect physicalconfigurations.andP;  The PMD standard specifies the MIC receptacle as theinterface for interoperability, with a reference MIC plug in an appendix.andO;MIC attenuation is not specified, but available components have demonstratedtypical attenuation of 0.5 dB.andM;The FDDI PMD contains an optinal optical bypass function for stationsattached to the trunk ring.andP;  This function maintains dual-trunk ringoperation when attached stations are not operating, providing tolerance bothfor multiple faults and for parallel ring throughput.andM;The PMD bypass function makes available a choice of technologies, includingmechanical and solid state switches.andP;  Station switching times of up to 25milliseconds and ring interruption times of up to 15 milliseconds arepermitted.andP;  Use of optical bypass is optional, depending on the applicationand configuration.andM;Work has begun on a single-mode PMD standard that will employ a laser diodeoptical transmitter operating over single-mode fiber.andP;  This transmissionsystem will support longer link lengths (up to 40 km) and will be upgraded tohigher data rates (1 GB per second).andM;There is also significant interest in developing both a ruggedized system formilitary use and harsh industrial environmentals, and a low-costimplementation based on a single (non-redundant) ring.andM;While MAC and PHY have been developed in an environment of relative harmony,PMD has been more controversial.andP;  There were few vested interests when theMAC and PHY documents were generated, and the development was done in anatmosphere of cooperation among the major systems houses.andP;  Now, however, theoptical fiber and components manufacturers do have significant vestedinterests.andP;  The &quot;connector wars&quot; lasted for almost three years and resultedin numerous rounds of standards document balloting, lost time, and lowproductivity.andP;  Finally, in June 1988, the PMD Draft ANSI Standard (dANS) wasforwarded (in a rare frenzy of common sense) to the X3 Standards Committeefor further processing.andM;Station Management.andP;  Possibly the most controversial standard is StationManagement.andP;  Work on the FDDI SMT standard has been hindered by seriousdisagreements on scope and objectives.andP;  In this instance it is the majorsystems houses (DEC, IBM, etc.) that are at odds, and the reasons are simple:Station Management deals with all the issues surrounding the FDDI's actualoperation and the necessity of integrating it fully into the overall systemsstrategy of a supplier.andP;  This situation is particularly disturbing, becauseit points up the fundamental differences between the networking designs ofmany major suppliers.andM;Stated bluntly, SMT is a political football.andP;  While no on interest group isstrong enough to force the issue, it seems there are several that are capableof blocking decisions they don't like.andP;  The prognosis is not good.andP;  Nodefinitive standard for communications management functions has ever beensuccessfully produced, to our knowledge, by a standards committee.andP;  InJanuary 1987, we believed it was feasible to produce a draft SMT standardthat year.andP;  Today, it appears that SMT is still about a year away.andP;  In a veryreal sense, SMT is a victim of FDDI's success.andM;Industry Impact.andP;  Although FDDI has been a long time in the making and doesnot have the bandwidth required for many proposed future applications, it ishaving a major impact on the industry.andP;  FDDI is an enabling technology: teincreased bandwidth, greater extensibility, and lower error ratescharacteristic of FDDI provide a much-improved platform for applicationdevelopment in comparison with any of the first-generation networks.andM;FDDI is suitable for its originally intended use as a high-performance,extended, backend, distributed multiprocessor/peripheral LAN, but it is alsothe ideal technology for &quot;backbone&quot; LAN applications.andP;  A backbone LAN is ahigh-bandwidth facility used to interconnect first-generation LANs.andP;  BecauseFDDI uses the same addressing scheme as 802.X LANs and provides the sameservices to LLC, it is an easy for FDDI to bridge to any 802.X LANs as it isfor them to bridge to themselves.andP;  With ten times the bandwidth of Ethernet,FDDI can support these bridging operations and interconnect high-performanceperipherals--such as database servers--and users.andM;Some concerns remain, however.andP;  To establish an efficient backbone structure,low-latency bridges, routers, and gateways must be developed.andP;  This is not afunction of FDDI alone, but of upper-layer protocol processing as well.andO;Existing implementations attempt to provide these services by runningsoftware on general-purpose microprocessors.andP;  The results have beendisappointing because of the complexity of the existing protocols (TCP/IP,TP-4, and others).andP;  Recently, developments in high-performance &quot;transfer&quot;layer protocols, including the Xpress Transfer Protocol (XTP), have beencause for optimism.andM;A transfer protocol is a recombination of transport and network layers of theOSI Reference Model--the combination of TCP (Transport) and IP (Network), forexample.andP;  This kind of protocol--characterized by highly streamlined,efficient algorithms--can be implemented in software for existing systems orbe rendered directly in VLSI for higher-performance requirements like thosefound in Cray's HSX or the new ANSI High-Speed Channel (HSC).andP;  Often referredto as &quot;lightweight&quot; protocols, they are anything but lightweight, as theyreduce latencies and increase both functionality and throughput.andM;High-performance backbone networks depend on the FDDI and transfer protocoldevelopments that will yield low-latency gateways and allow nodes actually to&quot;sink&quot; the increase bandwidth.andP;  Sinking the increased bandwidth will becomeeven more important in years to come, as the bandwidth of all networksincreases and applications are developed to process increased amounts ofdata.andP;  Today, only the highest-performance VME implementations can sink FDDIbandwidth--and they can do little else.andP;  A number of system-relatedissues--having to do with the operating system, memory speed, and datamanagement (how many times data is copied around within the system)--combinesto defeat throughput.andM;The most extensive use of FDDI will likely fall into the category ofsecond-generation &quot;front-end&quot; networks.andP;  Systems now produced by such vendorsas Ardent, Silicon Graphics, and Stellar have the processing power that wasfound only in computer rooms just one year ago.andP;  These systems need theincreased performance possible with FDDI; in fact, for many of theapplications being proposed for such systems, FDDI bandwidth is insufficient.andM;For the next few years, however, only the top end of the market will be ableto capitalize on the opportunities that result from advances in networktechnology.andP;  The primary reason for this is cost.andP;  Initial FDDIimplementations for VME and Multibus systems will very likely cost between$7500 and $10,000, given the cost of VLSI, fiber-optic transmitter/receivers,and other components.andP;  Memory will most likely be the major consideration.andO;The high-link bandwidth available on FDDI (8 to 10 MB per second) will easilyflood the I/O capacity of most existing systems.andP;  This will necessitate afundamental redesign of many systems so that they can take advantage ofFDDI's capabilities.andM;For example, a typical VMEbus configured as a network adapter can sinksomewhere between 2 and 10 MB per second, provided that little else is goingon in the system.andP;  At the top end, this means a system can sink the FDDIbandwidth and do nothing else.andP;  If you try to throw in a few disk operationsor run a second process at the same time (a normal occurrence), there isreally no contest: the sustained throughput on the FDDI will bury the node.andM;It is unlikely that FDDI will find acceptance in PC-class machines for manyyears.andP;  The operating system, memory speed, bus architecture, and a host ofother system-related design limitations--as well as costconsiderations--conspire to limit its applicability.andP;  As these systems areredesigned, their new architectures may give them the ability to handle FDDIbandwidth, making lower-cost FDDI implementations more prevalent.andM;The raw bandwidth available with FDDI could have a significant effect on thedesign of the next generation of networked hardware.andP;  Increased bandwidthwill become one of the fundamental design criteria for networked systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
