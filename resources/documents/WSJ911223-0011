As a former public-high-schoolboard member, I can attest that it is vital that the publicbe exposed to such worst-case scenarios so that citizens ofother school districts have a chance to avoid making similarerrors.   You touched on a vicious-circle syndrome: The essence isthat many communities around the country are approaching arealization that their public schools are, in fact, a primaryagent in the rapid final decline of their overallcommunities.</LP><TEXT>   Let me explain. You cited the homeowner in a fine Holyokeneighborhood with a home assessed at $230,000. But hecouldn't sell it for $150,000 two years ago. To make ageneral statement, the home obviously had a market value ofsomething less than $150,000, nowhere near the &quot;assessed&quot;$230,000. Why would home-market values decline soprecipitously? His taxes (most of which go to the schools)are at the $1,800 level, having apparently increaseddramatically over the past several years. As property taxesgo up, the amount of mortgage a prospective home purchasercan carry goes down. Ipso facto, sooner or later, propertyvalues decline, leading to more iterations of communityimplosion.   &quot;Precipitous&quot; is the right adjective for this syndrome.School districts can tax and tax apathetic communities overmany years with a high degree of impunity. But then anexternal event comes along to precipitate a rapid downwardspiral. In Holyoke's case it's the usual one -- an economiccontraction manifesting itself in a variety of ways,including declining state aid. The whole effect is not unlikethe breaching of an earthen dam.   We soon will be seeing many more Holyokes around thecountry.   John G.B. Howland   Glenview, Ill.   ---   As an American, I was ashamed to read about the refusal ofHolyoke, Mass., voters to fund their school systemadequately. Any society that would permit such a neglect ofits children's education surely has lost some fundamentalsense of moral duties. My shame was heightened by theconclusion from this story that Holyoke voters' decision wasin part motivated by racism.   As a 29-year-old working person who makes the maximum FICApayments, I was incensed to read of older Americansbegrudging the cost of educating young Americans. Mygeneration will be paying the Social Security and Medicaidbenefits for those same older Americans for the next 20 or 30years. The benefits many of them receive (particularly thosewho have already retired) will far exceed the money they paidinto the Social Security system. By the time I retire,actuarial predictions suggest that the Social Security fundwill be near bankruptcy.   I marvel that the voters of Holyoke do not realize thatthey will continue to pay for their decision not to fundeducation with the costs of higher crime and a lessproductivework force.   L. Michelle Boeckman   Dallas   ---   If Holyoke is &quot;collapsed,&quot; then our school system inOklahoma in the 1930s was a veritable black hole. And yet wenever thought of ourselves as deprived. At the schoolreunions there are lots of people who are near the top oftheir professions and businesses, and quite a few Ph.D.s. Butmostly they seem to be happy people, interested in the world,surrounded by friends and family, and looking backcontentedly on full and useful lives. At the very least, thatcollapsed school system taught us to read and write andcalculate as well or better than contemporary graduates. Canit be that the attitude of our parents and teachers countedfor more than the things Holyoke lacks?   John W. Bowling   Troy, Ala.</TEXT></DOC>
