Ask the users ofMicrosoft Corp.'s Windows software.   Many users gripe that Microsoft has oversold the program'sbenefits. They complain that hidden costs utterly dwarfWindows' $99 street price. They cite slow performance,occasional &quot;crashes&quot; that halt their computers and awkwardincompatibilities with other software products. Says LonnyCordell, a Texas Instruments Inc. programmer, &quot;Once you getinto Windows, you see its tarnished edges.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The problems are being trumpeted in user magazines anddiscussed on electronic bulletin boards. They are causing anunexpected embarrassment for Microsoft, by far the industry'sdominant company.   Windows also is shadowed by a legal dispute betweenMicrosoft and Apple Computer Inc., which filed suit threeyears ago alleging that Microsoft borrowed portions ofWindows from Apple's Macintosh system software. On Wednesday,a U.S. judge boosted Apple's chances in the pending case, butthat isn't likely to slow acceptance of Windows. The ruling,says Charles Saile, manager of PC services at Rohm andamp; HaasInc., &quot;won't make any difference&quot; to his plans to adoptWindows.   Part of Windows' problem is its incredible success. Theprogram has so many benefits that sales have totaled astaggering 2.75 million copies since it was introduced inMay. Every major software developer is busily producingsoftware that works with it. With so many users andsupporting products, more difficulties are bound to arise.   Users also may be holding Windows to a higher standardthan other programs. Defenders of Windows note that it'scommon for glitches to bedevil new software programs. Theyadd that most of the trouble with Windows stems from itsorigins as simply a jazzy add-on to the DOS operating systemsoftware. &quot;Windows wasn't originally designed with networkingin mind,&quot; so now it must change to meet new requirements,says Rebecca A. Bailin, a software consultant in Sausalito,Calif.   Even with these problems, Windows is still fast on its wayto becoming a standard program on personal computers,analysts say. Microsoft itself says that it has correctedsome problems already, and that others were the result of thefailure of other software makers to adapt their applicationsto Windows. Microsoft vows to release an upgraded version ofWindows later this year, which it says will fix othershortcomings.   &quot;Windows is good; it can always get better,&quot; says BradSilverberg, the Microsoft vice president in charge of theproduct, which makes it easier to use International BusinessMachines Co. PCs and compatibles. It does this by allowingusers to control their machines by pointing at icons ormaking selections from menus on the screen with the help of adevice called a mouse, not by the traditional method oftyping strings of nonsensical characters.   Still, some critics say Microsoft has sold Windows hard --too hard. The British Committee of Advertising Practicerecently asked Microsoft to &quot;immediately withdraw&quot; an ad thatclaimed that switching from a non-Windows spreadsheet to aWindows spreadsheet program would save a person 147 minutes&quot;each working day.&quot; Rival Lotus Development Corp. complainedthat the average spreadsheet user only works on a spreadsheetfor 120 minutes a day. Microsoft contests the ad committee'scharge, noting that it was leveled after the ad &quot;had run itscourse.&quot;   Meanwhile, corporate buyers criticize Microsoft'sprediction that switching 500 users to Windows would boostproductivity so much that a company would save $500,000 inthe first year and $3 million over three years. When a groupof 14 companies organized by Microsoft and Corporate SoftwareInc., a Needham, Mass., software distribution firm, analyzedtheir own results, they concluded that it would actually cost$670,000 in the first year and save just $600,000 over threeyears.   &quot;It's not just a $99 commitment,&quot; says Charles Saile,manager of PC services at Rohm andamp; Haas Inc. in Philadelphiaand a study participant. &quot;For a person to convert over toWindows is probably going to cost $1,200 to $2,000, dependingon how many packages they put up, the memory upgrade and alsotraining.&quot;   Others complain of problems that are more subtle, but justas maddening to a frequent PC user or a manager of PCnetworks. Applications sometimes run painfully slowly onWindows, if they are stored on a computer elsewhere on thenetwork. Simply installing Windows on hundreds of PCs can bea huge chore. The current version doesn't allow for batchinstallation, meaning each copy of Windows must be installedindividually. Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash.,plans to include batch installation in its next release ofWindows.   Training is another time-consuming problem. Microsoftpredicted that workers would need just eight hours oftraining before they became proficient in Windowsapplications, such as word-processing or spreadsheet tasks.But the companies in the Corporate Software study concludedthat 20 to 30 hours of training was needed. And now,Corporate Software is establishing a hotline to answerquestions for users in order to relieve company PC managersfrom being deluged. It predicts customers will happily pay$150 a user for three months of questions.   Sometimes, Windows can chew up more than time. Windowslets users switch quickly from one application to another,but in the process, users sometimes learn their PC doesn'thave enough internal memory to handle multiple applications.A little white box pops up on the screen that says,&quot;Unrecoverable application error.&quot; When that happens, &quot;youlose whatever you were working on,&quot; says Mark Tebbe,president of Lante Corp., a Chicago-based computerconsultancy. Mr. Tebbe, who sometimes runs nine separateapplications at once, is enamored of Windows, but says ittook him months to fine-tune his computer to avoid losingwork.   For PCs on computer networks, more problems appear. DavidKahn, president of D. Lawton Associates, a Natick, Mass.,computer consulting firm, says he tells his small businesscustomers, &quot;if you don't really need it, don't bother.&quot; Mr.Kahn says that to make Windows work on PCs connected to thepopular Novell Inc. network, he has to update 15 Novellutility programs and every sub-routine for connecting to thenetwork. &quot;You may be faced with two days worth of maintenancejust to be compatible with Novell, and this is a programbilled as Novell-compatible. You can imagine my customers getangry.&quot;   A spokeswoman for Microsoft counters that &quot;there are noknown problems with Windows and Novell on network.&quot; She saysthe two companies have worked together since May to fix anyglitches.   Such glitches aren't always the fault of Windows.&quot;Sometimes, its the fault of the hardware, and sometimes theuser gets confused and does something wrong by playing withthe icons,&quot; says Jack Bauman, manager of end-user computingat Hughes Aircraft Co., Long Beach, Calif. &quot;A little bit oftraining usually clears that up,&quot; he adds.   PC managers wooed by Microsoft say they're confident itwill correct many of the problems in the next version. Andthey remain enthusiastic about Windows' future. &quot;Windows is agiant step in the direction of making software easier touse,&quot; says Owen Greeson, vice president, sales and marketing,for software supplier Automated Design Systems Inc., Atlanta.David Gusman, systems officer at Society Corp., Cleveland,says: &quot;It's a more intuitive way to use a computer.&quot;   But present problems continue to confound them. LindaShultz, a PC manager at Hercules Inc., Wilmington, Del.,complains that sometimes when she moves her mouse to click onan icon, the icon starts moving around the screen instead ofstarting up the indicated program.
