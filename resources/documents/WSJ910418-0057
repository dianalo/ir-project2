According to the American Petroleum Institute, whichreleased its weekly U.S. oil statistics late Tuesday afterfutures trading had closed, gasoline inventories on Fridayhad fallen to 204.2 million barrels.</LP><TEXT>   The figure was 2.3 million barrels less than those of aweek earlier. It also was the lowest level in more than 15years, according to the Pegasus Econometric Group of Hoboken,N.J., and was just slightly below what the industry considersits minimum operating needs to avoid tight supplies.   The result of the API report was a renewal of the gasolinerally. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasolinefor May delivery jumped 1.89 cents a gallon to settle at74.18 cents. The June contract was up 1.16 cents a gallon to71.04 cents.   The rally in gasoline spilled over into some of the otherfuels markets. In U.S. futures trading, May heating oil wasup onehalf cent a gallon to 56.13 cents.   Crude oil also was affected despite indications of morethan ample supplies. But trading in crudes generally waslackluster. Generally, the markets that firmed up werelighter grades which yield more gasoline and are traded inthe U.S. and European futures markets.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for Maydelivery rose seven cents a barrel to $21.71. The June crudecontract was up six cents to $21.30. On London'sInternational Petroleum Exchange, the Brent blend crudefutures were up three cents to eight cents a barrel.   Prices of fuels in Europe also rose slightly, although theincreases weren't nearly as much as those in the U.S.&quot;Gasoline's strength is largely an American phenomenon,&quot; saidEdward N. Krapels, president of Energy Security AnalysisInc., a Washington concern that monitors oil markets andinventories world-wide.   Among the reasons for the strength, Mr. Krapels said, isthe reduced production of gasoline because of shutdowns ofrefineries in both the U.S. and Europe for annualmaintenance. Low imports of gasoline into the U.S. fromEurope &quot;have been an important part of the story,&quot; he added.   By mid-May, however, Mr. Krapels expects gasolineproduction by U.S. refineries to be back up. Also, he said,&quot;imports by then should be up to 400,000 to 500,000 barrels aday.&quot;   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of futures contracts for corn,wheat and soybeans fell. Traders were disappointed by reportsthat the Soviet Union probably won't be getting a largeamount of economic assistance from Japan anytime soon. Sometraders had thought that the outcome of Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev's visit to Japan might be amultibillion-dollar line of credit to Moscow. So far,however, nothing of that scale has materialized. Moscow needscredit in order to arrange imports of farm commodities. Itsrequest for $500 million in credit guarantees from the U.S.continues to face many obstacles. Meanwhile, recent rains insome wheat-growing regions are increasing the prospects ofthe coming harvest, prompting farmers to sell some of theircrops stored since last year.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices surged on speculation that thenationwide railroad strike will interfere with coppershipments. Copper for May delivery closed at its high of$1.11 a pound. Besides the U.S. rail strike, labor unrest inAfrica and South America also fueled speculation of supplydisruptions. As the price rose, additional buying based ontechnical factors kicked in to push the price to its high,which is an area of technical resistance, traders said. Alsocontributing to copper's strength was the stock market'srally, which gave copper traders &quot;a certainhigh-spiritedness,&quot; said one trader. &quot;If you view the stockmarket as a leading indicator, stocks are saying theeconomy will rebound, and that will be good for copper aswell,&quot; said John E. Gross, a West Nyack, N.Y., metalsconsultant. Copper's performance yesterday was entirely dueto expectations, he added, because the supply and demandsituation hasn't improved. In fact, copper stocks haveincreased significantly because of weak demand, he said.Because copper closed above $1.10, Mr. Gross expectsadditional buying by commodity funds based on technicalfactors.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices fell on estimates of higher worldproduction this year. Coffee for July delivery ended 0.85cent a pound lower at 93.65 cents. F.O. Licht, a statisticalfirm, raised its estimate of world coffee production for1990-1991 to 93.3 million 132-pound bags, said CelesteGeorgakis, senior analyst at Cargill Investor Services.That's considerably higher than its previous estimate of 91.7million bags, but still below last year's production of 94.4million bags, Ms. Georgakis noted. Estimates for Arabicacoffee were lowered by one million bags to 64 million, butRobusta coffee estimates were raised by 2.8 million bags to29 million, she said. Both coffees are used by roasters, Ms.Georgakis said, but there has been a tightness in supplies ofthe higher-quality Arabica coffee. She expects coffee pricesto continue to trade within their recent range of 91 cents to93 cents. Separately, a Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange seatin New York sold for $69,000 yesterday, down from $70,000 inthe most recent sale on April 1. The current bid is $66,000and the offer is $71,000. A year ago, a seat was sold for$86,000.</TEXT></DOC>
