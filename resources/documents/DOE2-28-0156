These primary projects are competingto transport natural gas from sources outside California to the Bakersfield,California area for use in enhanced-oil-recovery projects. In each case,producers of crude oil in the San Joaquin Valley would use the naturalgas as boiler fuel to create steam, which would then be injected intothe oil fields to produce crude oil not recoverable by primary recoverymethods. Some of the steam would be used to generate electricity. TheFEIS was prepared under the direction of the FERC and SLC staffs to satisfythe requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the CaliforniaEnvironmental Quality Act.</TEXT></DOC>
