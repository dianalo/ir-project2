Much of the data has been released from confidentialindustry files and thus allows, for the first time, a full appraisalof the subject. Contents include - Types and Distribution of Ice, MechanicalProperties, Measurements of Ice-Structure Interaction, and Analysis ofIce Failure and Design Ice Loads. This work is completed with a fullliterary review and subject index.</TEXT></DOC>
