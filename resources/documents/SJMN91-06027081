Our captured airmen are likely to have endured beatingsand torture beyond our comprehension in an effort not to utter the words ourwar protesters clamber eagerly to declare on national television: that the waris crazy.;    It's difficult to reconcile the protesters' claim to support thetroops, what with their vocal denunciation of the effort for which thosetroops risk their lives.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  EXPELLING SADDAM IS A WORTHY CAUSE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     I support the world's military response to Iraq's barbaric despot, and I'mdeeply grateful for the men and women who put it on the line for the rest ofus. If the effort to expel Saddam Hussein is not a worthy one, I fear tocontemplate the one that is.;    -- Beth Connor; Los Altos;  VICTORY WILLBELONG TO WHOEVER'S LEFT; If I could speak to President Bush and SaddamHussein, I would say: War does not determine who is right -- only who isleft.;    -- K.G. Silkett; San Jose;  WE AT HOME FACE MOST PAINFUL TIMES;George Bush refers to &quot;the times that try men's souls.&quot; How are we tried? Byhaving to think before we drive? By having to commit resources to thedevelopment of alternative sources of energy besides oil?;    The times thattry the souls of &quot;the men&quot; in the United States are those that see legislationsuspended which would have ensured funds for education . . . that see wholefamilies in homeless shelters and on the streets . . . that see aid todependent families slashed . . . that see greed corrupt our banking system . .. that see cavernous gaps expanding between those who use unlimited access tofunds to be elected to positions of power, and those who live the spirit ofthe principles which drove our forefathers to leave security behind and riskall to establish a better life.;    What are we not being told? Are the eventsin the Persian Gulf merely practical labs for testing the latest technology?Are they a lazy and simplistic means of preventing massive unemployment ofmilitary personnel? Or are they simply the incompetence of immature men whohave never learned to eat their broccoli?;    -- Fran McBrien; San Jose;  WHATABOUT STATUS OF PUERTO RICO?; With the world debating Kuwait and Lithuania,what about the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico?;    Does President Bush intendto give statehood status to Puerto Rico, or independence?;    -- BruceBloomfield; San Jose;  DECISION TO ENLIST; IS A PERSONAL ONE; On Jan. 21 youran an article about East Side Union High School District giving lists ofgraduating seniors to military recruiters. According to the story, therecruiters have been telephoning these 17- and 18-year-olds as often as twicea day.;    My son is a junior at a local high school. His school experience ispart of a process of maturing, of gaining tools and methods to think throughsituations that will occur in his life. It is an education about our world andhis responsibilities to that world and to himself.;    I believe that thedecision to join the military is a choice that should be made with verydeliberate thought and soul-searching. Basic to the decision is: &quot;Am I willingto take another person's life?&quot; That is not a question that a high schoolstudent would normally ask, but war is not normal.;    I do not want my son'sname released to military recruiters so he can be harassed or influenced aboutthe military. I do not want him or any other son or daughter offered up torecruiters for war. I do want all students to have the time to do their ownsoul-searching and to make their own decisions.;    -- Kathy Workman; Soquel; DON'T SHELTER US; FROM HORRORS OF WAR; The news is so unbalanced about thewar. What about Baghdad and its innocent civilians? Let us see the fullhorrors of what we are doing.;    Let us see the end result of that hugebuildup of weapons in the 1980s. Supposedly, the best brains in the countrywere working on weapons in that decade. Let us see what those brains haveproduced.;    How pitiful we have become! The world's superpower has beenreduced to barbaric behavior in order to deal with a barbarian. I feel a deepsense of shame at our inability to cope with Saddam without such exaggeratedviolence. We have become like him.;    Don't restrict the news. Publish everygrim and tragic photo so that we can see war for what it is.;    -- BeverlyAinscow; Sunnyvale  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910127  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  757  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday January 27, 199100027081,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
