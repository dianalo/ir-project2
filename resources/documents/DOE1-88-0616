A computer-graphics-basedsystem was developed that provides an operator with an improved methodof planning, evaluating, and directly controlling robot motions. Duringthe direct control of a remote manipulator with a joystick device, theoperator requires considerable sensory information in order to performcomplex tasks. Visual feedback which shows the manipulator and surroundingworkspace is clearly most important. A graphics program which operateson a Silicon Graphics IRIS workstation was developed that provides thisvisual imagery. A unique obstacle collision warning feature has alsobeen incorporated into the system. Obstacles are monitored to determinewhether any part of the manipulator comes close or strikes the object.The graphics system developed has advanced man-machine interaction inthat improved operator efficiency and confidence has results.</TEXT></DOC>
