British Telecom, the telephone company, ended its own service ayear ago and announced Friday that it was indefinitely suspendingthe other privately run ``chatlines'' effective Monday.   ``We have taken this action in the public interest followingacute and growing public concern over chatlines, which we feel hasbrought the whole service into disrepute,'' said a company statement.   Critics of the party lines _ with which people can call a numberand speak to like-minded strangers _ welcomed news of the cutoff butexpressed worry over those in debt to the telephone company.   Costs for the services were 66 cents per minute during peak hoursand 44 cents per minute during off-peak times. Newspapers haveprinted stories of parents facing phone bills of $5,000 to $10,000run up by their children.   Although British Telecom said it could not waive high bills ``wewill work out a way in which an account can be paid which is bestfor the family,'' said Duncan Lewis, director of products andstrategy.   The Independent Chatline Association, which represents most ofthe 100 companies providing the services, was holding emergencytalks to consider the news.   British Telecom was privatized in 1984 but remains the country'smain telephone company, with monopoly privileges and a near-monopolyon services.   A final decision on the party lines, which are enjoying widepopularity in the United States, is expected after the Monopoliesand Mergers Commission publishes the results of a study on Feb. 28.</TEXT></DOC>
