CFTC officials said the case is only the first of a seriesit expects to bring in the next few months. But the complaintcomes just two weeks after federal prosecutors suffered asetback in a similar case in Chicago. In that case againstthree Chicago Mercantile Exchange traders, the jury reachedguilty verdicts on only eight of more than 100 charges.</LP><TEXT>   The CFTC charged Douglas Friedman of Forest Hills, N.Y.;Michael Pomerantz of Scarsdale, N.Y.; Lawrence Beck of FortLee, N.J.; John King of Old Bridge, N.J.; and MSP TradingInc., a firm owned by Mr. Pomerantz. All are registered withthe CFTC as floor brokers, although Mr. Friedman tradesprimarily for his own account, the CFTC said. Messrs.Pomerantz, Beck and King declined to comment; Mr. Friedmancouldn't be reached.   The CFTC hasn't determined the amount of damages it isseeking in the nine-count administrative complaint, and noneof the defendants has settled the case.   Federal investigators swooped down on New York's majorcommodity exchanges in May 1989, seizing records and issuingsubpoenas to as many as 50 futures traders as part of a probeof possible criminal and civil violations. The investigation,which was much smaller than the separate Chicago undercoverinvestigation, focused on several alleged trading abuses,according to people familiar with the New York inquiry.   The agency said that 34 times between July and December1988, Messrs. Pomerantz, Beck and King executed, with Mr.Friedman's help, noncompetitive buy and sell transactions oncrude oil-futures trades for customers on the New Yorkexchange's floor. The CFTC said the transactions allowed thebrokers to trade for their own accounts, against theircustomer orders.   The CFTC alleged that Messrs. Pomerantz, Beck and King,helped by Mr. Friedman, deceived customers and defrauded ortried to defraud customers. It also said that Mr. Friedman,helped by the others, engaged in fictitious sales and causeduntrue prices to be reported.   The alleged misdeeds, which will be decided at a hearingby a CFTC administrative law judge, carry potentially massivepenalties. The Commodity Exchange Act allows the CFTC to finethe traders $100,000 for each violation, several of which mayhave taken place in each trade, the agency said. The tradersalso could have their trading privileges revoked.   The four probably won't be the last CFTC targets in theNew York investigation. &quot;I am confident there will be furtherrecommendations of charges to the commission,&quot; said DennisKlejna, the agency's enforcement director. The commissionmust approve any recommendation by the enforcement division.   The charges will be closely watched, coming on the heelsof the first decision in the Chicago case. While prosecutorsin that case had obtained guilty-plea agreements from severaldefendants, much was riding on the recent jury trial. Thejury's verdict left the government's case uncertain.   But Mr. Klejna said he didn't give all that much thoughtto the Chicago decision. &quot;What happened in Chicago has notemboldened us or discouraged us in any way,&quot; he said. TheCFTC complaint is an administrative charge, which carries alesser burden of proof than that of criminal cases.   One Chicago lawyer suggested that the CFTC could bestrengthened by the Chicago decision. The CFTC has been&quot;doing the job, and what it's said about the market over theyears is borne out&quot; by the failure of prosecutors to provewidespread fraud in the Chicago markets, said JohnTroelstrup, a partner at Gottlieb andamp; Schwartz. Now, he added,he expects to see the CFTC act more aggressively towardexchange activities.</TEXT></DOC>
