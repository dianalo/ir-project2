'Delhi34' and Phaseolus vulgaris L. 'Pinto' to 0.15 ppm SO/sub 2/ or 0.10 ppmNO/sub 2/ resulted in increased % dry weight compared with control. Theexposure of these species to these gases in mixture resulted in decreaseddry weight compared with control. Few of these changes were statisticallysignificant. The exposure of S. tuberosum and Z. mays to a variety ofconcentrations and durations of SO/sub 2/ and/or NO/sub 2/ showed similartrends. The gas mixtures had a negative effect on % dry weight comparedwith the control, although not all of the changes were statisticallysignificant. The single gases were associated with a mixture of positiveand negative changes in % dry weight compared with the control; all thestatistically significant changes were increased % dry weight. Theseresults suggest that single gases at these concentrations may be beneficial,while their combination may be harmful.</TEXT></DOC>
