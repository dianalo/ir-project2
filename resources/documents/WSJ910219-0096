The sale is the latest step in the family's plans toreduce debt and to focus more on real estate and other&quot;strategic&quot; businesses, including oil exploration andproduction and forestry.</LP><TEXT>   The shares in the British food and spirits company werebought by a group of British securities houses and dispersedamong various institutional investors. Toronto-based GWUtilities, which also has energy interests, plans to use partof the proceeds to retire #181.5 million in bank debt. A GWUtilities spokesman said the company has net cash of about250 million Canadian dollars (US$217 million) following thesale, compared with net debt of C$1 billion at the end of1990.   Meanwhile, the Reichmanns' closely held holding company,Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd., appears to have failed inits year-long attempt to sell a 20% equity stake in its U.S.real-estate holdings. Olympia andamp; York officials had said thesale was proposed as part of the company's plan to smooth thetransition from the Reichmann brothers to their children. Thestake has been valued at between $600 million and $800million.   Real-estate executives said no serious negotiations weretaking place with any of the dozen or so institutions Olympiaandamp; York had hoped would be interested in the purchase. Theysaid Olympia andamp; York would likely change the terms of the salelater. For now, these executives said, the matter isn't ahigh priority for the company.   An Olympia andamp; York spokesman added that &quot;discussions&quot; werebeing held with two institutions, but made clear that thetalks weren't expected to produce a deal in the near term.   One of the two institutions Olympia andamp; York referred to isbelieved to be the California Public Employees RetirementSystem. A Calpers spokesman confirmed the pension fund hadmet with Olympia andamp; York officials once, in December. &quot;Theymade a presentation to us, and we chose not to act on it,&quot; hesaid.   Olympia andamp; York officials have taken pains to emphasizethat the company's efforts to sell assets don't mean it isstrapped for cash. &quot;The 20% sale was conceived as a strategicmove in relation to the long-term interests and successionplans of the Reichmann family,&quot; said John Zuccotti, presidentof Olympia andamp; York's U.S. subsidiary. &quot;It was not born of thecurrent circumstance in which the real-estate industry findsitself.&quot;   Like all investors with large U.S. real-estate holdings,Olympia andamp; York has suffered setbacks, but these aren'tconsidered to be on the order of the problems afflictingother developers. Of its 12 Manhattan office towers, only oneisn't meeting its debt service, an Olympia andamp; York spokesmansaid. The mortgage on that building, which once housed thedefunct investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., isbeing serviced by general Olympia andamp; York funds, the spokesmansaid.   Olympia andamp; York's greatest challenge at the moment iscompleting its Canary Wharf real estate development inLondon, which eventually is expected to cost #4 billion.Olympia andamp; York already has invested more than #1 billion inthe project and has secured #500 million in long-term bankfinancing. Negotiations for an additional #600 million infinancing have been slowed by Britain's property market slumpand by worries about the economic fallout from the war withIraq, said an Olympia andamp; York spokeswoman in London.   The sale of the Allied-Lyons shares comes just afterOlympia andamp; York received C$350 million as its portion of aspecial dividend paid by GW Utilities. The Toronto companymade the payout following the sale of its 82% stake inConsumers Gas Ltd. to British Gas PLC.   Olympia andamp; York has proposed selling its controlling stakein Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd., which owns Canada'slargest oil pipeline. The sale, which could ultimately raiseas much as C$680 million for Olympia andamp; York, is conditionalon a complex proposal by the Reichmanns to reorganize thefamily's energy holdings.   Olympia andamp; York also has proposed acquiring the 10.7% of GWUtilities it doesn't already own for C$30 a share, or a totalof C$125.7 million.</TEXT></DOC>
