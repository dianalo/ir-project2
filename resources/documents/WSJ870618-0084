The Houston FBI office announced yesterday that it is in the midst of a criminal probe of several federally insured financial institutions in the Houston area that it expects will lead to &quot;a number&quot; of fraud prosecutions. Separately, it is understood that a federal grand jury in Dallas has issued subpoenas for banking records and other documents concerning more than 250 North Texas individuals involved in Sandamp;L operations, real estate sales, land development and investment.    Andrew J. Duffin, the FBI special agent in charge at Houston said agents are looking into &quot;insider&quot; fraud and self-dealing transactions such as improper loans by a bank or thrift to its own officers, loans to cronies of bank and Sandamp;L officials or to entities in which the managers of the bank or thrift have a personal financial stake.    &quot;We're putting the criminal element -- if they happen to be in a bank -- on notice that we are committed to ferreting out bank fraud in Houston,&quot; Mr. Duffin said.    The federal investigations in Houston and Dallas come as 31 banks have failed in Texas so far this year, already exceeding the 26 Texas banks that collapsed in all of 1986. So far, four Texas Sandamp;Ls have been placed into receivership by the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp., which insures thrift deposits; three Texas thrifts were placed into receivership by the FSLIC in all of last year.    What's more, top managers at several other Texas savings and loans have been replaced by regulators who say that management was part of the problem at the institutions. More Sandamp;Ls would be liquidated, federal regulators say, but the FSLIC insurance fund is broke and there aren't enough funds for regulators to close the institutions and pay insured depositors. Federal regulators say there are at least 20 and possibly as many as 40 insolvent Texas thrifts still operating.    Fraud is being recognized as a leading cause of problems in financial institutions, federal officials say. Banking regulators say that fraud, self-dealing and insider abuse are problems in about a third of the nation's bank failures. A congressional study concluded recently that fraud and other misconduct are the leading causes of failures for California Sandamp;Ls. The report concluded that fraud at many thrifts has &quot;reached epidemic proportions.&quot; It said evidence of &quot;serious insider misconduct&quot; was found in most of the 30 California thrifts that failed in the past three years. The failures cost the now-insolvent FSLIC $3.7 billion.    Houston ranked second to New York City last year, with $196.6 million in gross losses from bank fraud, the FBI said.    Mr. Duffin's remarks came at a Houston news conference at which he announced the indictments by a Houston federal grand jury of two former directors of First Commercial Bank of Texas, a small Houston bank that failed earlier this year. In addition, Michael S. Byers, the former president of the bank, pleaded guilty to conspiring with one director to issue a letter of credit without the consent of the board of directors. Under federal bank regulations, loans and credit arrangements extended by a bank to a director must be approved by the directors of the bank.    The two former directors who were indicted are Glenn R. Wingate, Conroe, Texas, and Refugio Gonzales of Humble, Texas. The FBI said Mr. Byers, who also is from Humble, issued separate letters of credit to Mr. Wingate and Mr. Gonzales for their businesses, in which Mr. Byers also had interests.    Neither Mr. Byers, nor Mr. Wingate nor Mr. Gonzales could be reached for comment.    In Dallas, U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins said recently that at least five attorneys from the fraud section of the Justice Department in Washington will be moving to Dallas this summer to form a bank fraud task force that plans to investigate North Texas banks and Sandamp;Ls. In addition, the Dallas FBI staff is adding several agents to conduct an investigation of Texas financial institutions. An FBI spokesman declined to elaborate. </TEXT></DOC>
