(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Employees at an elegant mall have not beenable to figure out why a duck chose a planter outside the complexto prepare for motherhood, but they're making her comfortable asshe sits on her nine eggs.   ``We have a layette all planned out, and a shower in theworks,'' said Mary Ellen Brigman, who works at Saks Fifth Avenue atthe Somerset Mall. ``And a makeover. After nine kids at once, she'sgoing to need it.''   The duck has spent about a month at the mall sitting on her eggs.   When the eggs hatch in about two or three weeks, the HumaneSociety may move the duck and her brood to a nearby lake.   No one is sure why the duck moved to the mall.   ``Maybe she's a country duck who wants to be citified,'' saidMagda Marudas, a personnel supervisor for Saks. ``Or just a classyduck.''</TEXT><DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The big cheese is back.   The ``Belle of Wisconsin,'' a mammoth, 20-ton block of cheddarcheese, has returned home after a yearlong tour of the UnitedStates.   The cheese _ measuring 20 feet long, 6 feet wide and 6 feet talland weighing 40,060 pounds _ arrived in Milwaukee this weekendafter touring 350 cities in 36 states.   ``In the metropolitan areas, they didn't care much for it. Therewas so much else going on,'' said Pat Patterson, 59, who drove theBelle's custom-made semi-trailer truck some 55,000 miles in thelast year.   ``But in the outlying areas and in the suburbs there was a realgood reaction, especially among the children,'' he said. ``Some ofthem asked questions like `How much milk did it take?' or `How manycows did it take?'''   The Belle will begin a second tour of Wisconsin later this weekthat will end at the State Fair in August. The block will then besliced into one-pound chunks and sold around the country.   Created by cheesemaker Dave Simon, of Little Chute, in March1988 and sponsored by the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, the Bellewas marketed as the largest block of cheese ever.   Wisconsin is the No. 1 cheese producer in the country, with anannual output of more than 1.9 billion pounds.</TEXT></DOC>
