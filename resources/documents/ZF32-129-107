Van NameandM;and Bill CatchingsandM;We gripe a lot.andP;  It's a big part of our job.andP;  Sometimes, though, we complainso much that you could easily believe we don't like anything.andM;That's not the case at all.andP;  We actually like some products quite a bit -- somuch, in fact, that we use them regularly in our lab.andP;  None of them isperfect, and none of them is as showy as the hottest new server.andP;  On theother hand, they all work well, and they're all reliable enough that we canand do depend on them.andM;The following products are some of what we consider to be the necessities ofmodern networking life.andP;  Xircom pocket network adapters: Two of today'shottest technologies are networks and portable computers.andP;  One of the first-- and still one of the best -- links between the two is Xircom's line ofpocket network adapters.andP;  Other firms, such as D-Link, now also make goodpocket adapters, but Xircom was there first and still has the broadestproduct line.andM;When we receive a new portable for testing, one of the first things we do islink it to our network.andP;  All we have to do is copy the right driver filesonto the portable's hard disk, attach the Xircom pocket adapter to theportable's parallel port, and we're in business.andM;The same process works equally well, of course, with desktop computers --andyou don't even have to open them up or fiddle with interrupts.andP;  When we needto run a few quick tests on a new system or maybe just download some filesfrom one of our servers, a Xircom adapter is often the fastest path to ournetwork.andM;Western Digital-compatible Ethernet boards: Western Digital's 8-bit WD8003and 16-bit WD8013 Ethernet adapters are two of the safest bets in networking.andO;No, they aren't the fastest boards around, but they are about the most widelysupported.andP;  Everything seems to work with these boards, a fact that makesthem great for all the testing we do on our Ethernet LANs.andM;Of course, we aren't the only ones who've noticed the widespread support forthese boards.andP;  Other network-adapter vendors also offer WesternDigital-compatible boards.andP;  We've had very good luck, for example, with theHayes EtherMate 8 boards, which have worked as Western Digital stand-inseverywhere we've tried them.andM;Shiva's FastPath 4: Like most organizations today, we have both Macs and PCs.andO;For linking PC Ethernet LANs with Macs, or for linking LocalTalk Macs withEtherTalk Macs, we usually turn to FastPath.andP;  This little box is simple toset up: Just connect the LocalTalk and Ethernet cables, and then plug it in.andO;You do have to load a few files onto one of the Macs, but that's a relativelyeasy process.andM;9,600-bps V.42/V.42bis modems: Once you've stepped from 2,400 bps to 9,600bps, it's hard to go back.andP;  Toss in the added speed from V.42bis compressionand the reliability of a V.42 link, and you're likely to get hooked.andP;  We are.andM;We move a lot of data between our main lab and a smaller, satellite one.andO;Those transfers take valuable time.andP;  High-speed modems reduce that time and,therefore, pay for themselves quickly.andP;  We rely regularly on the Hayes, ATITechnologies and Digicom modems, but many others we've tested work well also.andM;Quarterdeck's Manifest: All PCs have problems, but networked PCs tend to havemore problems than most.andP;  When you're trying to figure out just what isloaded on a PC and where all of its RAM went, there's no substitute for agood system-information program.andP;  Several solid packages are available,including Touchstone Software's CheckIt and Merrill andamp; Bryan Enterprises'InfoSpotter, but we most frequently use Quarterdeck's Manifest.andM;Manifest doesn't provide the most comprehensive set of system facts, but whatit does offer is clear and easy to read.andP;  It also works quickly and reliably,two attributes that are particularly important in those troubleshootingsituations where everybody's already on edge.andM;Microsoft serial mice: More and more PCs come with Windows or a DOS shellalready installed, and those graphical programs demand a mouse.andP;  If you don'thave one ready when you have to set up or test a new system, you're in for alot of needless hassle.andP;  Because everything in the PC world works with aMicrosoft serial mouse, a small stack of them should be part of any labmanager's hardware closet.andM;The Hewlett-Packard LaserJet IIIsi laser printer: We know the IIIsi isn't aperfect network printer -- we offered a recipe for the perfect printer in anearlier column -- but it's the closest thing out there today.andP;  The IIIsi isfast, can sit right on your Ethernet or Token-Ring networks and producesgorgeous output.andP;  We use it for all our big print jobs, where its speedtranslates into noticeable time savings.andM;We know that none of these products is particularly showy, and few will stealany headlines from NetWare or LAN Manager or VINES.andP;  All of them, however, dotheir jobs, and do them well.andP;  That's a lot in today's industry.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
