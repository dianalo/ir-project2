Once again the dollar was a big moving force in major overseas stock markets. As it firmed, it helped Tokyo prices recover and sharply boosted share prices in London and Frankfurt.    Monday, the Nikkei stock average posted a record one-day point loss of 831.32. An hour after the Tokyo market opened Tuesday, the average was down nearly 266 points. Forty minutes later the average was down a record 1066.90.    Prices started to recover as banks and trusts entered the market, drawing other buyers from the sidelines. The Nikkei average ended with a loss of 182.55 at 22889.86.    Turnover rose to 1.1 billion shares from one billion shares Monday. Despite the rebound in prices, the market was filled with losing shares, which outnumbered winners 622 to 276.    Steel, construction and securities stocks softened across a broad front. Blue-chip electrical shares were up.    Traders didn't point to any specific news to account for the huge early sell-off. They did say, however, that investors are cautious because of the volatile foreign exchange market and uncertainty over the outlook for economic growth in the U.S. and Japan. As a result, buying demand was soft.    &quot;It's not that the market went down because something happened,&quot; one trader said. &quot;A lot of people were watching from the sidelines and, when those banks and trusts came in, they started following them in.&quot;    Dealers were divided, however, over how prices will move the rest of the week after the market reopens following a national holiday Wednesday. Some say a correction is probably over while others think prices will sink some more.    Construction shares suffered broad setbacks, including Taisei, down 20 yen to 1,190 yen ($8.55), and Kajima, off 40 at 1,940. Theses issues had been advancing for some time on anticipation of vigorous government efforts to expand domestic demand. However, their sharp gains through last week made investors cautious.    Steel issues fell, including Nippon Steel, down 25 at 345; Kawasaki Steel, down 5 at 235; and Nippon Kokan, down 10 at 325.    Securities stocks continued to lose ground after recent sharp gains. Daiwa Securities fell 100 to 3,300, Yamaichi Securities 90 to 2,710, Nikko Securities 70 to 2,730 and Nomura Securities 50 to 5,450.    Shares of electrical concerns, which would benefit if the dollar regained some strength, were up. Sony rose 150 to 2,870, Hitachi gained 42 to 910 and Toshiba advanced 38 to 763.    Other export-oriented blue-chips rose, including Fanuc, up 400 to 4320; Fuji Photo Film, up 270 to 2,870; NEC, up 110 to 1,600; and Matsushita Electric Industries, up 100 to 1,600.    Also aiding these issues, dealers said, were reports suggesting easing trade tensions between Japan and the U.S.    In London, stock prices rose sharply after major banks cut their base lending rates and Imperial Chemical Industries reported better-than-expected net income.    The Financial Times 30-share index surged 24.2 to 1589.4, and the 100-share index advanced 35.5 to 2022.1.    Imperial Chemical said net income jumped 58% in the first quarter, and its stock price rose 65 pence to 12.32 pounds ($20.44).    Almost all stock groups gained. Those showing particularly strong increases included building materials, construction contractors, motors, brewers and distillers, food retailers, textiles, chemicals, oils and insurers.    British Petroleum rose 35 pence to 9.14 pounds; the company raised its offer for the shares of Standard Oil that it doesn't already own to about $7.9 billion.    Mining stocks fell as the price of gold dropped. The gold mines index plunged 23.5 to 440.1, and gold shares in Australia and South Africa plunged.    Frankfurt stock prices, meanwhile, rebounded after two declining sessions as investors tracked the dollar's upturn.    The U.S. currency's gain overnight on reports that the U.S. views a further dollar decline to be &quot;counterproductive&quot; was the main factor pushing prices higher, brokers said.    Big international blue-chip shares led the market's advance, including auto, electrical and banking issues.    Deutsche Bank gained 22 marks to 638.5 marks ($356.13), Commerzbank rose 11.3 to 269.5 and Dresdner Bank was up 8.5 to 340.5.    Among auto makers, Daimler-Benz gained 34 to 990, Bayerische Motoren Werke was up 24 to 569 and Volkswagen moved up 7.9 to 347.4.    The report that AEG boosted its net operating earnings to 130 million marks ($72.5 million) in 1986 from 100 million marks in 1985 sent the share up 4 to 312.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
