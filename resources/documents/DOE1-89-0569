The method recommended here includes theessential points: computing reflection coefficients with the use of Zoeppritzequation, modeling the observation system in seismic data acquisitionand the stack process, and making the modeling research of thin bed.The template of relative amplitudes of reflection waves from oil andgas reservoirs, which was plotted using this method, can be employedto predict the reflection characters of oil and gas reservoirs. The exampleshave proved that the reservoir reflection characters predicted by thismethod are more similar to the true ones, and in predicting the gas reservoirthis method is particularly better than other methods. Future steps inhydrocarbon indication will be first to predict by this method the reservoirreflection characters to search for the anomalies due to reservoirs onseismic section, and second to determine the reservoir by making amplitude-offsetanalysis before stack.</TEXT></DOC>
