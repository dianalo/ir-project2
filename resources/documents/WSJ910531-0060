Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, here on a long-scheduledvisit, said the U.S. will provide 72% of the estimated $300million needed for the next stage of developing the Arrowmissile, a defensive system being designed in Israel.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Cheney said the U.S. Air Force would deliver 10older-model F-15 fighters, valued at a total of $65 million,as the first step in fulfilling a congressional authorizationto give Israel as much as $700 million in spare equipmentfrom U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force stocks.   A U.S. official said the timing of Mr. Cheney'sannouncement, immediately on the heels of the president'sarms-control proposal, was a coincidence, and that the U.S.will persist in its effort to get various countries to agreeon Middle East arms restraints.   Israeli officials were guarded in their comments on thearms-control proposal, saying they needed to study itsdetails. One provision calls for Israel to stop furtherdevelopment of its nuclear arsenal if its Arab enemies agreenot to pursue nuclear weapons programs.   Avi Posner, a spokesman for Israel's prime minister,Yitzhak Shamir, said the Jewish state places &quot;greatimportance&quot; on President Bush's efforts to get both armssuppliers and their buyers in the Middle East to agree tolimit the arms race.   Mr. Posner pointed out that Israeli officials earlier hadcalled for limits on conventional arms. As for PresidentBush's suggestion that Israel shut down its plutoniumproduction facility at Dimona, he repeated the same obliquepolicy statement that Israel traditionally uses when it isquestioned about its secrecy-shrouded nuclear program:&quot;Israeli policy is that it will not be the first to introducesuch weapons into the Middle East.&quot;   Squaring President Bush's new arms-control plan with priorU.S. arms commitments to Israel will present the Bushadministration with some difficult decisions. Congress, inits efforts to reward Israel for its restraint during thePersian Gulf War, last year authorized the U.S. services togive Israel as much as $700 million of spare equipment andanother $200 million of equipment to be stored in Israel forpossible U.S. use.   Although Israel has requested far more equipment than thelaw permits, defense officials say the U.S. militaryservices, facing severe budget cuts, are reluctant to give upequipment for shipment to Israel.   Meanwhile, Israeli officials are worried that PresidentBush may be unable to persuade all the nations that supplyarms to Arab nations to limit their sales. Of particularconcern to the Israelis are the Chinese and North Koreans,both of whom have recently sold missiles to Syria.   Israel's Arrow missile, an outgrowth of U.S. &quot;Star Wars&quot;technology, is designed to replace the Patriot as Israel'smain defense against attacking missiles. A faster, moreaccurate and longer-range weapon than the Patriot, the Arrowis designed to track and destroy missiles before they reachTel Aviv or other Israeli population centers. Theshorter-range Patriot sometimes hit Iraqi Scud missiles overtheir targets, showering Israeli cities with heavy debris, onsome occasions including intact warheads.</TEXT></DOC>
