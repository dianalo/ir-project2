Col. Oliver North's Virginia home, according to congressional investigators.    House and Senate committees investigating the affair are focusing on three 1986 payments, totaling nearly $15,000, that they have traced back to the operation.    The panels last week voted to compel Glenn Robinette, a private security consultant, to testify under a grant of immunity. A former Central Intelligence Agency operative, Mr. Robinette has said that he paid an estimated $2,000 for an automatic gate on Col. North's property, and the Washington Post yesterday reported that he had provided a sophisticated electronic security system for the fired White House aide's home.    Mr. Robinette, who was unavailable for comment, is a longtime associate of Thomas Clines, a former CIA officer who was part of the covert arms network overseen by Col. North and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord.    Federal law prohibits government officials from accepting any gratuity from private individuals connected with their official duties. More broadly, the payments are important as investigators try to establish whether members of the network benefited personally from arms sales to Iran and the Nicaraguan Contras. </TEXT></DOC>
