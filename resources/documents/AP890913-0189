HighCommissioner for Refugees.   The office registered 61,345 arrivals in countries of firstasylum in South East Asia and Japan from January through August,just before seasonal conditions traditionally slow down the exodus.   The outflow compared with 45,500 for last year and 74,000 in1981. Hong Kong reported 32,000 arrivals during the first eightmonths, almost twice the 1988 total of 18,400, the U.N. group said.   In recent weeks, there have been numerous fights in the crowdedHong Kong camps, and cholera has broken out among other Vietnameserefugees living in primitive conditions on outlying islands.   Most of the newcomers in the British colony face forcedrepatriation as ``economic migrants'' because only those boat peoplewho arrived before June 16, 1988, were automatically considered tobe fleeing political persecution and thus eligible for refugeestatus.   In June, a 60-nation conference in Geneva formally endorsed aplan to curb the outflow but did not commit itself on how to dealwith economic refugees.   Hall said it was still too early to assess the impact of theconference, saying there were ``definite signs of abatement'' insome regions.   The measures adopted by the Geneva conference call for efforts toencourage the voluntary return of migrants who are refused refugeestatus. So far, only 260 have gone back despite formal assurances byCommunist Vietnam that they are welcome and need not fear anyreprisals.   Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, said Wedneday thatVietnam remains opposed to any forced return of the boat people.   The Vietnamese official also said negotiations with Washingtonwere continuing regarding the 94,000 former detainees of Vietnamese``re-education'' camps who have been promised new homes in theUnited States along with their families. He said this program wouldinvolve roughly 500,000 people.   He spoke to reporters after a two-day meeting in Geneva withWestern businessmen.</TEXT></DOC>
