President Bush and the leaders of the six other large,industrialized western democracies will meet through Sunday. Alongthe way, they will take time for lavish dinners, fireworks displaysand festive parades organized by French President FrancoisMitterrand to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the FrenchRevolution.   Almost as gleaming as the French celebrations has been theperformance of the world's economy.   In contrast to the gloom-and-doom forecasts following the October1987 stock market crash, growth in 1988 and through the first halfof this year has been stellar.   Virtually all the summit nations enjoyed an acceleration ofeconomic activity last year with total growth for the seven nationsaveraging 4.2 percent, the best showing in four years.   Such a performance clears the way for other topics to take centerstage.   Bush, attending his first economic summit, hopes to use themeetings to assume the mantle of leader of the Western alliance oneconomic and environmental issues, much as he did on militarymatters in May with his troop reduction proposals at the NATO summitin Brussels, Belgium.   Bush has said the environment is coming on like a ``freighttrain'' as an international issue and leaders of the other summitnations _ Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada _are facing growing political pressure to do something as well.   The president arrived in Paris after unveiling relatively modestaid proposals for Hungary and Poland during his history-making tripto the economically troubled nations. He looked to his summitpartners for similar commitments to boost economic and democraticreforms in Eastern Europe.   ``I'm going to tell them that there is dynamic change takingplace in Eastern Europe,'' Bush told reporters during the flight toParis from Budapest, Hungary.   The recent turmoil in China will also be a primary topic when theseven leaders hold their discussions at a modernistic arch on theoutskirts of Paris. But the talks are unlikely to produce any callsfor new sanctions in retaliation for the crackdown on dissent inChina. Most of the Western leaders fear that any further isolationof the Beijing government might derail economic reforms the countryis undertaking.   Not that there aren't economic concerns as well.   Trade imbalances have begun to widen again with the threat thatan unruly rise in the dollar could make America's trading woes evenworse in the coming year.   Inflation is on the rise, as well, although U.S. leaders insistthat the increase is a blip and not the start of a long-term problem.   There is also the seemingly intractable problem of the $1.2trillion debt burden that has depressed growth in the developingworld for over a decade.   As for environmental concerns, Bush is bringing alongEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly to helpexplain the administration's new proposals to cut carbon monoxideand the pollutants that cause acid rain.   The talks also are expected to cover such topics as depletion ofthe ozoe layer, global warming, deforestation and ocean dumping.   Reilly said he was expecting something of a race between thesummit leaders ``to be the greenest of all on this issue.''   Bush is also looking to the summit to give a boost to hisadministration's Third World debt proposals. On March 10, TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady unveiled a strategy emphasizing debtforgiveness and interest-rate reductions instead of simply addingnew lending to the huge debt burden being carried by developingcountries.   The administration's desire to present the summit with an earlysuccess story got a boost over the weekend with the announcment thatnegotiators for the commercial banks and Mexico were near a bargainon a debt-reduction package for the Third World's second largestdebtor.   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, one of the dozens ofworld leaders in Paris for the bicentennial celebration, saidThursday that the negotiations were at a critical stage and urgedthe summit nations to back the Brady plan.   The communique that will formally end the summit is expected toendorse the overall principals of the Brady debt plan and theJapanese, who already have pledged $4.5 billion to support thedebt-reduction effort, are coming to Paris with an even largerlending program to help the Third World.   The United States is likely to be criticized for what the otherparticipants view as a high-handed approach taken by the Bushadministration to remove trade barriers by threatening stiffsanctions against nations that fail to remove trade barriers Americafinds onerous.   Bush, in a pre-summit press conference, defended his targeting ofJapan, Brazil and India for possible sanctions if talks oneliminating barriers do not produce results.   While the U.S. trade deficit narrowed for the first time in sevenyears in 1988, there is concern that the rising dollar, which makesAmerican products less competitive overseas, will halt theimprovement with the U.S. deficit still at record levels.   The summit countries, beginning in 1987, have tried to coordinatetheir economic policies in such a way as to keep the dollar's valueon foreign currency markets within narrow ranges.   But earlier this year, despite those efforts, the dollar brokethrough the upward boundaries, leading some to question whether theeconomic coordination process was in need of a drastic overhaul.   However, just in recent weeks, the dollar finally fell backwithin the accepted ranges, taking the pressure off the summitleaders to come up with any significant new agreements aimed atdollar stabilization.   With the economy now in a record seventh year of peacetimeexpansion, Brady said the United States and the other summitcountries are not anxious to embark on broad new initiatives.   ``Nobody should be mistaken about the fact that we have very,very good economic conditions around the world,'' he said. ``Solet's not try and fiddle with the controls too much when you've gotthat kind of backdrop.''
