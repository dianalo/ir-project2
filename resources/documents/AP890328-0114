(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eight people stood in silent vigiloutside the Three Mile Island nuclear plant Tuesday to mark the10th anniversary of the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident.   The group held lighted candles and took up places about 50 yardsfrom the plant gate at 4 a.m., the hour on March 28, 1979, whenalarms pierced the air, warning of a water blockage that meltedpart of the plant's core.   ``It was an accident that changed the world as people knew it,''said anti-nuclear organizer Gene Stilp of Harrisburg. ``It was asafe atom no more.''   Commemorative events Monday included a march and rally outsidethe plant that drew more than 100 sign-carrying participants.   Judy Richards, 38, said the protests ``reinforce people's badfeelings about this place, and hopefully makes a difference topeople who work at the island. It's good to keep it current inpeople's minds, because the danger is here, every day.''   Tuesday morning, TMI Unit 1 puffed white steam into the inkypre-dawn sky, signaling that the reactor deep inside the plant waspumping heated water and driving steam turbines.   Ten years ago, in the adjacent Unit 2, water was blocked on thesteam side of the reactor and a pressure relief valve on theradioactive side stuck open. Within three hours, loss of coolingwater caused half of the 150-ton core to melt, and 20 tons ofuranium fuel and debris streamed to the reactor bottom. Water stillin its lower reaches of the vessel prevented a meltdown through thesteel reactor vessel.   Radioactive gas was released to the atmosphere and within days,tens of thousands of nearby residents had fled for safer areas.   Gordon Tomb, a spokesman for GPU Nuclear Corp., the utilitysubsidiary that operates the plant now, said extra people had beenassigned to the main gate this morning.   ``Over the years, these demonstrations have been peaceful and wedidn't expect anything different this year,'' he said.   As for the anniversary itself, Tombs said: ``We're inclined totake the opportunity to note the lessons from the Unit 2 accidentand remind ourselves of the importance of remembering thoselessons.''   The health effects of the accident continue to be debated.Various studies found no evidence of increased human cancers. Butanti-nuclear activists claim the studies were flawed and say theyhave seen evidence of increased cancers and vegetation mutations.   The nearly $1 billion cleanup of Unit 2 should be completed latenext year. At dawn, only three protesters remained, their candlesflickering as photographers took a last round of shots.   ``Even though the numbers were small, people are tired after 10years, everyone still has strong feelings,'' said Sean Downey, oneof the protesters.   ``The accident it not over ... it's still in effect.''</TEXT></DOC>
