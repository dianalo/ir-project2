First California Savings Bank of Orange, with $226.9 million in assets, was closed by the Bank Board and will reopen today as First California Savings. The new, federally chartered mutual association will be under the management-consignment program of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.    The Bank Board approved a new board for the association and contracted with Great American Savings Bank in San Diego to provide a management team.    The savings bank became the 23rd institution to come under the program in 1987 and the fourth in California. The program allows the FSLIC to stabilize the operations of an institution while it seeks a long-term solution to its problems.    The North Dakota banking commissioner closed Citizens Bank of Ray, in Ray, N.D. The two offices of the failed bank, which had assets of $12.1 million, are to reopen today as branches of First National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Williston, in Williston, N.D. Citizens Bank held deposits of $11.4 million in 2,400 accounts.    The American National Bank, Afton, Wyo., was closed by federal authorities, and the FDIC approved the transfer of its insured deposits to Star Valley State Bank, a state-chartered bank also in Afton. The failed bank's sole branch won't reopen.    American National had assets of $10.6 million, and $9.9 million in 2,600 deposit accounts, including $240,000 in six accounts that exceeded the federal insurance limit of $100,000. Uninsured depositors and creditors will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds realized from liquidation of the failed bank's assets.    Administration of the transferred insured deposits will be funded by an equivalent cash payment from the FDIC. The acquiring bank is paying the FDIC a premium of $5,000 for the right to receive the transferred deposits and will have an exclusive 60-day option to buy the failed bank's assets.    The failures bring the nation's total thus far this year to 147. It was the second bank in North Dakota to fail this year and the third in Wyoming. </TEXT></DOC>
