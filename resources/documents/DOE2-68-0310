Themethod consists of: cooling the feed stream to a temperature effectiveto cause at least a portion of the carbon dioxide in the feed streamto condense to a liquid; introducing the cooled, pressurized feed streamfrom step into a separator vessel wherein the stream is separated intoa first liquid bottom fraction (consisting essentially of carbon dioxide)and a first vapor fraction (comprising methane and/or nitrogen and carbondioxide); recovering the first liquid bottom fraction; taking the firstvapor fraction as a first overhead gas stream from the separator vesseland conveying the first overhead gas stream to a stripper tower and introducingthe overhead gas stream into the bottom portion of the stripper tower;passing the first overhead gas stream upwardly through the stripper towerunder conditions effective to separate the stream into a second liquidbottom fraction (consisting essentially of carbon dioxide) and a secondvapor fraction (comprising methane and/or nitrogen and carbon dioxide);introducing the cooled second vapor fraction from into a reflux accumulatorvessel wherein the cooled vapor fraction is separated into a third liquidbottom fraction (consisting essentially of carbon dioxide) which is recoveredand reintroduced into the top portion of the stripper tower; and a thirdvapor fraction (comprising methane and/or nitrogen and carbon dioxide)which is discharged or recovered.</TEXT></DOC>
