Kellogg Co., the oil-industry engineering and construction unit of Henley Group Inc., La Jolla, Calif.    The sale may indicate that Henley is raising capital to bid for the 85.3% of Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. that it doesn't already own.    Dallas-based Dresser said it will pay cash for the Kellogg unit, but didn't disclose how much. Industry observers estimated the price at $100 million to $200 million. Dresser said it expects to complete the acquisition in January, subject to governmental approvals.    The pending sale raises the prospect that other Henley asset sales may follow. The company, which has interests in manufacturing, engineering and financial services, has been actively negotiating to acquire Santa Fe Southern, which could cost Henley as much as $8.5 billion.    Henley earlier this month said it was talking to Santa Fe Southern, a railroad, energy and real estate concern, about an offer of cash and securities valued at $63 for each Santa Fe share. The stock closed at $49.625, down 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.    Henley is particularly well-structured for asset sales. The company, created in 1985 through a spin-off of dozens of operations unwanted by their Allied-Signal Inc. parent, is designed to nurture its troubled units with an eye to their eventual sale. Thus far this year, Henley has sold and distributed minority stockholdings in three revitalized subsidiaries.    Meanwhile, the purchase of Kellogg is another step in Dresser's plan to focus its business in the oil industry. Dresser designs and builds oil-field, refining, mining and construction equipment. Kellogg, based in Houston, is an engineering and construction management company. It builds gas-processing plants and oil refineries, and makes chemicals and fertilizers. About 80% of its revenue comes from international business.    Dresser officials have said that they believe the oil industry is on the verge of a turnaround and that the company wants to be poised to take advantage of that. A spokesman said Dresser is &quot;still interested&quot; in further acquisitions in the oil services industry.    The company has been raising cash for such purchases by selling its businesses that aren't related to oil services. Last year, Dresser sold four industrial materials and electronics divisions and several real estate holdings. And earlier this month, Dresser sold its Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co. unit to Rosenkranz andamp; Co. for $220 million.    The sale of those units has left Dresser with about $500 million in cash, the spokesman said; about $100 million will be used to complete an 11.5 million-share buy-back program begun in August 1986. In addition, the company is planning to sell other industrial products units that could bring as much as $200 million, the spokesman said.    In Big Board composite trading Friday, Dresser shares closed at $22, unchanged. In national over-the-counter trading, Henley shares closed at $20.75, up 25 cents.    The purchase of Kellogg would boost Dresser's annual revenue by about 25%. Kellogg had revenue of about $900 million in 1986, Henley said. In fiscal 1986 ended Oct. 31, Dresser earned $9.6 million, or 12 cents a share, on revenue of $3.7 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
