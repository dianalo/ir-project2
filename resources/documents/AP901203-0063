(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Russians asking questions aboutbasketball over the Moscow-to-Washington hot line? The Cold Warreally must be over.   Experts manning the hot line, which was rededicated today aftera $4.7 million upgrade, see evidence of glasnost in testtransmissions from the Soviets.   ``The project has helped keep the peace all these years and thisupgrade allows us to have state-of-the art communications,'' Lt.Gen. Jerome B. Hilmes, director of information systems in theoffice of the Secretary of the Army, said at a ribbon-cuttingceremony today.   Routine, maintenance-related dispatches have actually becomechatty.   ``Could we ask an unofficial question about basketball?'' theSoviets asked last February over the communications link set upafter the Cuban missile crisis to avert the accidental outbreak ofwar. ``Could you please tell us how our Kurtinaitis performedagainst your snipers?''   The Soviets were referring to Rimas Kurtinaitis, a 6-foot-5 starfrom Lithuania. The National Basketball Association had invitedKurtinaitis to challenge eight NBA stars in a three-point shootingcontest in Houston. ``Snipers'' apparently was the Soviets'translation of long-range basketball shooters.   ``We'd like to know how he feels in the NBA,'' the Sovietsasked.   ``Friends,'' the Americans technicians and linguists on the hotline replied, ``in the local newspaper it says that Kurtinaitis isfeeling fine, but there are no results from the competition.They'll probably be in tomorrow's paper.''   ``Several years ago,'' said Tom Brothers, manager of the hotline station at Fort Detrick, ``you would have never seen that.''   Technicians working at Fort Detrick in Frederick make sure theemergency communications link is available to President Bush andMikhail Gorbachev.   The hot line, established in 1963, allows the superpower headsof state to circumvent normal diplomatic channels and exchangewritten messages. There never was a red phone in the Oval Office,an image popularized in many movies.   The modernized operation includes updated transmitters andreceivers, control consoles and two new saucer-shaped satellitedishes. Replacement parts were becoming scarce for the old dishes.   ``At this station we never know when the president is using it.What we do is make sure the hot line is available to him,''Brothers said. ``Our checks are to make sure the Earthstation-to-Earth station link is OK.''   This is the line's third upgrade. The first hot line, atrans-Atlantic teletype cable, was prone to interruptions,including one caused by a Finnish farmer who cut a cable with hisplow the very first year. In the 1970s, a manhole fire north ofBaltimore cut off the cable's primary circuit. About the same time,American telephone workers accidentally cut the line's cables.   Today, each hot line message goes to the Soviet Union threedifferent ways - over a land cable and through two satellitesystems. The duplication ensures messages arrive at the Kremlin, orthe White House, during a crisis.   Any message Bush sends to Gorbachev is encoded and taken to anundisclosed terminal point in Washington. It is transmitted to theFort Detrick Earth station, 50 miles northwest of the nation'scapital, where the signal is enhanced and relayed to two Sovietsatellites.   The satellites, 22,300 miles above the equator, beam the messageto antennae south of Moscow.   The message is also sent to Moscow via Intelsat, anAmerican-owned commercial satellite system based in Etam, W.Va.   Since 1986, the presidents have been able to accompany theirwritten messages with maps, charts or other graphics.   ``It takes a matter of seconds for our communications to reachthe Soviet Union,'' said Brothers, one of 13 Field EngineeringCorp. employees who work at the Fort Detrick station.   Presidents have used the hot line more than 15 times in its27-year history, said Norm Covert, a spokesman for Fort Detrick.   One of the most notable uses was during the six-day Arab-Israeliwar in 1967. President Lyndon B. Johnson advised the Soviet Unionof U.S. ship and aircraft movements in the Mediterranean followingan Israeli attack on the USS Liberty.</TEXT></DOC>
