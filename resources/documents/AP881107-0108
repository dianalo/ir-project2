In an address opening the World Congress on Climate andDevelopment, former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt spelled outthe ecological evils that have plagued the Earth with droughts andfloods and threatened ultimate destruction of the environment.   He also pointed to the emergence of Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev and the imminent change of the U.S. presidency as a hopefor new attention on the environment.   ``I think one should not be too optistimic about it, but regardit as a first step'' that Washington and Moscow have made someprogress on arms control and regional conflicts, Brandt said at areception following his speech.   Referring to what he and other delegates see as a need toredirect spending from defense to environmental recovery, Brandtsaid the superpower initiatives ``could lead to substantially moreproductive talks on transfer of funds from the one to the other.''   The congress, which has drawn more than 400 participants fromEast and West and from industrialized as well as developingcountries, aimed to get the diverse nations and interests workingtogether to slow down a trend that portends drastic environmentalchange.   Former Swedish Prime Minister Ola Ullsten pointed to this year'sdrought in the United States as an example of climatic consequencesthat are ``emptying the world's food baskets.''   If U.S. farmers are hit by an equally severe drought in 1989,food shortages will result, Ullsten said.   ``We are not talking about the distant future, we are talkingabout next year,'' he warned.   While the assembled ecologists were shelled with a barrage ofenvironmental warnings, organizers said the aim of the conference isto work out practical solutions.   ``We do not want to create a sense of panic here or a stampedethat would have the consequence of limiting action to a small numberof countries that have the resources to react,'' said Hans-JurgenKarpe of the University of Dortmund's Institute for EnvironmentalProtection.   But he and others concede a sense of urgency must be instilled inthe public to counter the ``greenhouse effect'' _ the buildup ofgases in the atmosphere that swaddle the Earth and keep in too muchof the sun's heat.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency predicted in a draftreport issued last month that the warming trend is expected to raisethe average global temperature by 2 to 4 degrees by the middle ofthe next century.   It also could destroy coastline, cut deeply into U.S. crop yieldsand create water and energy crises affecting much of the nation, thereport said.   New measuring equipment pioneered by Canadian researchers hasalso disclosed recently that the hole in the Earth's protectiveozone layer exposes an area as large as the United States.   That gaping hole in the southern seam of the ozone lays bare theunpopulated Antarctic region. But some scientists fear the northernhemisphere is in for a similar breakdown of the barrier that shieldsthe Earth from the sun's cancer-threataning ultraviolet rays.   ``The Antarctic ozone hole is half the world away from Canada,but there is the threat of an Arctic ozone hole developing, and thatis close to a lot of Canadians,'' said John Reid, an atmosphericscientist from the Department of the Environment in Canada.   The problems, their causes and consequences are clear, theorganizers of the Hamburg conference say. What is needed is a planof action for curbing mankind's polluting habits.   Some of the participants, such as Michael Glantz of the NationalCenter for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., contend theenvironmental alarms being set off over global warming arepressuring societies to act without knowing what action to take orwhether climatic stability is a desirable objective.   ``There are always winners and losers, even in environmentalissues,'' Glantz said at the opening of the four-day congress.   ``Many of the predictions have positive consequences for somecountries, such as heavier rain in regions that are currentlyplagued by drought,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
