The EPA announced that the maker of ethyl parathion,Cheminova of Denmark, voluntarily agreed to stop selling thepesticide for use on fruits, vegetables and orchards by theend of the year. But citing the chemical's toxicity, the EPAsaid it is also proposing to ban its use on field crops,which represents 60% to 80% of the chemical's use in the U.S.The agency expects it will take at least 18 months to ban thepesticide entirely.</LP><TEXT>   Linda Fisher, the agency's assistant administrator forpesticides and toxic substances, said that beginning Jan. 1use of parathion will be subject to severe protectiverestrictions and limited to nine field crops.   Although there is no concern about health effects fromeating food treated with parathion, EPA records show thegreatest threat is to farm workers. An EPA study recorded 52accidental deaths between 1965 and 1980 due to exposure tothe pesticide. The agency said parathion is also the onlypesticide linked to a death from contaminated clothing thathad been laundered, and to three deaths of workers who hadre-entered treated fields.   Steven Jellinek, a spokesman for Cheminova in the U.S.,said the company will vigorously contest the EPA's proposalto ban parathion's remaining use on nine field crops,including wheat, alfalfa, barley, corn and sorghum. &quot;Webelieve that the remaining uses are inherently low-riskbecause they're applied by air. There's no re-entry byharvesters, unlike some fruits and vegetables,&quot; he said.   Mr. Jellinek said the company wasn't releasing estimatesof sales losses under its voluntary agreement to stop sellingparathion for use on 90 crops, or of the effects of the totalban proposed by the EPA.   Parathion has been under criticism from environmental andfarm-worker advocates for years. Al Meyerhoff, a lawyer forthe Natural Resources Defense Council, hailed the EPA actionbut said, &quot;it's about 30 years overdue.&quot;   Cesar Chavez, president of the United Farm Workers ofAmerica, complained that significant use of parathion willcontinue during legal proceedings on the proposed ban,allowing possible contamination not only of farm workers butof air, soil and water near field crops that are sprayed.   The EPA said parathion substitutes are available and wouldhave a negligible effect on prices for producers andconsumers. Mr. Jellinek, however, said farmers with smallerprofit margins could feel an economic impact because theywill have to resort to a variety of chemicals to achieve thesame results as parathion.   Besides deaths, parathion has been linked to chronicillnesses, including loss of concentration, irritability,memory problems and depression. In addition, the agency said,there is evidence of bird kills and hazards to aquatic lifethat form the food chain for fish.</TEXT></DOC>
