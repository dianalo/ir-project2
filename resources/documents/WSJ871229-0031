The Electronic Industries Association of Japan issued a report on developments in the computer chip industry since the signing of the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement in September 1986.    President Reagan imposed 100% tariffs on $300 million of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, saying Japan had violated the 1986 agreement to open its home market wider to American-made semiconductors and to stop &quot;dumping&quot; chips at unfairly low prices in other countries.    The report said progress has been made in opening Japan's computer chip market to foreign producers, and called the U.S.'s retaliatory trade sanctions against Japanese goods &quot;groundless.&quot; A recent survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry showed the market share of foreign-made semiconductors was 12.7% in June-August of this year, up from 10.3% when the trade pact was signed.    The report also pointed to the U.S. government's acknowledgment that Japanese chip producers weren't now dumping products in third-country markets. In November, the U.S. lifted $84 million of tariffs, after a U.S. Commerce Department report that Japanese chip manufacturers had stopped dumping chips in third-country markets.    The move followed a decision in June to lift $51 million of the trade sanctions because of Japanese compliance with the semiconductor agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
