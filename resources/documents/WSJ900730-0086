The butterfly was supposed to come out of the cocoon spunlast August when Arnold Staloff was hired with much fanfareas president of the Comex. He had been head of new productdevelopment and marketing at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange,where he led the development of currency options. The ideawas for Mr. Staloff to produce a string of new contracts thatwould reinvigorate an exchange whose volume depends on gold,silver and copper.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Staloff resigned May 1. During his tenure no newproducts were listed, though one of his creations, a vehicleknown as a gold participation contract, will be sent nextweek to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission forapproval. The butterfly's wings were clipped, it is widelybelieved in the New York futures community, because Mr.Staloff was ill-prepared to negotiate the highly politicalwaters of the Comex.   Mr. Halperin, who was an executive vice president at theComex before Mr. Staloff's appointment, left the exchange totake a similar position at the New York Mercantile Exchangeshortly after he lost the top job to Mr. Staloff.   &quot;I only had to fill two shopping bags and walk about 80feet down the hall,&quot; says Mr. Halperin, 47 years old, abouthis most recent move from the New York Merc back to theComex. But there is, according to some traders, a world ofdifference between the busy, expanding Merc and the Comex,which has barely grown in the past five years.   Comex prides itself on being the world's largest metalexchange, but its trading volume in futures and optionsincreased only 12% from 1985 through 1989. That minusculerise includes several periods during which the copper marketwas extremely active. During the same five years, the NewYork Merc's volume jumped 390%, and trading on all U.S.futures exchanges increased by 80%.   Mr. Halperin says he isn't troubled by volume. &quot;A fewweeks ago, people were saying the gold market was dead. Thenwe get a little shakeout in the stock market and volume picksup to 50,000 to 60,000 contracts a day,&quot; he notes.   What is important, he says, is that he expects the Comexto earn a profit of $6 million to $8 million this year. Hesays that trading volume is significantly above theexchange's break-even point.   For over a year the Comex and the Merc have held talksexploring merger of the two exchanges. Mr. Halperin wasclosely involved in the talks when he was a vice president atthe Comex and at the Merc, and at both exchanges he wasviewed as a strong advocate of a merger.   One Merc official asserts Mr. Halperin's return to theComex strongly indicates that he believes a merger isunlikely. But Mr. Halperin says that a merger is no threat tohis job security. &quot;Because of my knowledge of bothinstitutions it wouldn't be difficult for me to work out myposition in a combined organization,&quot; he says.   One Comex floor trader says he believes the probability ofa successful merger is no more than 50%. Mr. Staloff, theformer Comex president, says regardless who is president, &quot;amerger will depend upon convincing 25 or 30 influentialmembers at both exchanges that it is a good idea.&quot; He addsthat those people are not necessarily on the exchanges'boards.   Mr. Halperin's career has been concerned mostly withfinancial, administrative and operational matters. Now hemust try to find new products that will appeal both to floortraders and the investing public. He says the Comex's boardhas recently approved the idea of trading gold contracts withsuper-long maturities of as much as five years -- currently,futures are listed as far out as 23 months -- and he adds theboard is also looking at gold options with only five-daylives.   Mr. Staloff says that as long as the metal markets remainactive, the exchange is viable. But, he adds, &quot;I don't knowhow any exchange can survive with products in only one area.&quot;He notes that the Philadelphia exchange has thrived byexpanding from a base in stocks into options on stocks andcurrencies. But Mr. Staloff cautions that launching newproducts is never easy.   Several members of the Comex say the exchange is enteringa new inward-looking era and that Mr. Halperin is the rightperson for the presidency. One floor trader and former Comexboard member notes, &quot;He is a superb administrator and hewon't shake up anything.&quot;   But Mr. Halperin says the Comex will continue to look fornew products, and adds, &quot;I don't view the death of theMoody's {Investment Service corporate} bond contract and thelow volume of the aluminum contract as failures. The realityof new products is that only one in 20 succeed. If you can'tdeal with the contracts that don't succeed you can't reap therewards {of those that do}.&quot;   He cites the perseverance that the New York Merc has hadwith its energy contracts as an object lesson for the Comex.&quot;By not being afraid of failure, they succeeded,&quot; he says.Recalling that the Comex's fortunes used to be tied to rubberand hides, he observes, &quot;If we had stuck with them wewouldn't be trading anything today.&quot;   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Crude oil prices are expected to remain stable in comingweeks. The sharp swings both downward and upward are expectedto halt based on the new OPEC accord, which set a totalproduction quota of 22.5 million barrels until the price formajor OPEC crudes reaches $21 a barrel. Although the formerquota was lower by 400,000 barrels, less oil will actually beproduced if all cartel members adhere to their newallocations.   Crude prices will likely edge up in coming months aswinter demand for fuel begins to come into play andburgeoning global inventories are whittled down. There waslittle price reaction to the accord of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries Friday because the agreement&quot;came out as advertised,&quot; says Ted Eck, chief economist forAmoco Corp. Gasoline prices, however, have climbed in recentdays as supplies of the car fuel in the Northeast tightened.Analysts and traders say that the number of gasoline cargoesfrom Europe have declined as demand for the fuel there pickedup.                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Rain forecast for much of the Corn Belt over the weekendjust ended is likely to keep futures prices from mounting anysustained rallies this week, analysts say. Rumored increasesin demand in the form of export orders may fuel briefrallies, but they will be more than outweighed by theprospect for bountiful U.S. supplies of grains and soybeansat harvest time.   Soybean futures prices jumped Thursday on rumors that theSoviet Union would use a portion of the proceeds from planneddiamond sales to increase its imports of soybean meal andcorn. But prices retreated Friday under pressure from the wetweather forecasts.   Besides, the Russian diamond sales ought to be viewed as alonger-term negative for the commodity markets, says DanielMarkey, president of Agri Analysis, Chicago. &quot;It's a sign ofdesperation. If they have to sell diamonds to buy grain atthese prices, how are they going to be able to afford ourgrain at higher prices?&quot; Mr. Markey says.                                                                                                          Copper                                                                                                          Futures prices rose last week, particularly Friday. TheSeptember contract closed three cents a pound higher at$1.2590, and most months rose to new life-of-contract highs.However, as visible supplies of copper mounted, some analystsquestioned whether the gains can be sustained.   Technical considerations appeared to outweigh fundamentalsFriday. For example, traders actively bought contracts whenthe September contract rose above $1.2450. In the process,they ignored increases in exchange warehouse supplies and areport of weak economic growth in the second quarter.   London Metal Exchange copper stocks Friday rose 17,225tons to 84,975 tons and Commodity Exchange supplies were up653 tons to 13,088 tons. The London exchange increase wasabout as expected, but over the past three weeks these stockshave risen 41,000 tons, a significant quantity.   The U.S. gross national product rose 1.2% in the secondquarter, below expectations and down from a 1.7% rise in thefirst quarter. Also a negative for copper demand was that theGNP increase for 1989 was revised down to 2.5% from 3%.   The Mineroperu mine strike in Peru, which began Thursday,is about 50% effective, and a settlement is expected thisweek. According to one analyst, &quot;There is generally anoptimistic view of the strike because of the cooperative toneof the talks.&quot;   If the technical strength in futures continues to prevail,the analyst says, September futures could rise to as high as$1.29 a pound, which would be an important resistance level.</TEXT></DOC>
