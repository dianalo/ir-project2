The Canadian dollar is flirting with a 13-year highagainst the U.S. dollar despite a steep drop in Canadianrates, and analysts say the currency doesn't seem ready tofall any time soon. That's because global investors arechasing still-attractive yields in Canada's bond market,Canada's inflation rate is declining, and the nation'seconomy is recovering.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I don't see any reason for the Canadian dollar strengthto turn around at this point. Overall, I still think it'sgoing to continue to appreciate,&quot; says Thomas Benfer, aforeign exchange marketing representative at the Bank ofMontreal in New York.   Late Friday here, the Canadian dollar was quoted at 88.59U.S. cents, slightly higher than 88.56 cents late Thursday.Last Tuesday, the Canadian dollar traded as high as 88.65cents, its strongest level since July 1978. It reached thatpeak despite recent sales by the Bank of Canada.   Although the Canadian dollar stalled late last week andsome traders anticipate a downward correction in the nearfuture, the upward trend is expected to remain intact.   In Tokyo early Monday, the dollar was trading at 120.05yen, down from Tokyo's close Friday of 129.85 yen. Meanwhile,the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6940 marks, up a bit from1.6928 marks at Friday's close.   The link between a currency's performance and a nation'sinterest rates is usually tight. Traders tend to shun acurrency when rates fall and buy when rates rise. But theCanadian dollar is bucking the trend even amid a gradualeasing by the Bank of Canada that has brought Canada'sshort-term rates down nearly six percentage points in thepast 17 months.   The Bank of Canada began easing in May 1990 when its bankrate was about 14%. On Thursday, the bank rate was set at8.33%, the lowest level since Oct. 29, 1987. The bank rate isthe Bank of Canada's charge on loans to depositoryinstitutions.   That credit relaxation hasn't hurt the Canadian dollarbecause Canadian yields are still high enough to lure globalinvestors, analysts say. In Canada, 91-day Treasury billsyield 8.11%, compared with 5.09% on three-month U.S. Treasurybills.   Despite falling rates, investors believe &quot;it makes sense&quot;to invest in Canadian dollar-denominated issues, says PaulBabirad, an economist at the Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto.   Canadian dollar bond issuers have brought plenty ofwell-received supply to the market this year. In the Eurobondmarket, for example, this year's Canadian dollar sectorissuance is expected to total about 18 billion Canadiandollars (US$15.9 billion), about three times more than lastyear's C$6.34 billion (US$5.6 billion).   The capital moving into the Canadian bond market lookslike money &quot;that is probably there to stay,&quot; says Mr. Benferof Bank of Montreal. He concedes, however, that the Canadianbond markets could run into trouble if supply begins toexceed demand.   But analysts say optimism about Canada's inflation pictureand economy should continue to fuel demand for both Canadiandollar-denominated investments and the Canadian dollar.   Canada's inflation rate, at 5.8% in August, was downsubstantially from 6.8% in January. The Canadian governmenthas projected that inflation will fall to 3% by the end of1992 and to 2% by the end of 1993.   There is &quot;broadening perception&quot; that Canada is winningits fight against inflation, says John Grant, chief economistat Wood Gundy Inc. in Toronto. As for the economy, he says,&quot;a relatively strong expansion is getting under way.&quot;   Because of the Bank of Canada's credit relaxation, therewill likely be a strengthening in residential constructionand plenty of inventory building in the next four quarters,he says.   Mr. Grant says the economy will probably grow at a 4%annual rate in 1992 after contracting at an annual rate of0.7% this year. But he says it's unlikely that exports willhelp the economy along because the strength of the Canadiandollar is making Canada's goods expensive for foreigners.   While currency watchers agree on the causes for theCanadian dollar's firmness, there's no solid consensus on itslikely course in the next six months. Mr. Benfer says a riseto 90 cents isn't out of the question, but Mr. Babirad ofRoyal Bank of Canada says a trading range of 88 to 89 centsis likely.   According to Mr. Grant, the Canadian dollar may be &quot;in thepeaking process.&quot; He says there will likely be furtherdeclines in Canada's rates, which in turn will pull theCanadian dollar down toward 87 cents.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold forcurrent delivery settled at $359.90 an ounce, up $1.10.Estimated volume was a light 2.3 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was quoted at $360.65 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
