More than half went to Mexico. ``Facing growing violence fromcocaine traffickers in their own countries, the governments ofLatin America are fighting back,'' the department said in astatement.   These countries are building rural mobile police units,eradicating coca plantations and looking for new crops for peasantgrowers, it said.   ``The U.S. government is working with a number of Latin Americangovernments to build up their own capabilities for eradication andinterdiction,'' the statement issued by the press office said. ``Weare committed to helping these governments and will continue toprovide training and equipment.''   Two years ago, Congress required that U.S. airplanes andhelicopters used on anti-drug missions remain udner U.S. ownership.The statement issued today was in response to inquires prompted byan account by the Knight-Ridder news service.   State Department officials said on Tuesday that Bolivia hadmounted machine guns on six U.S. helicopters under a drug-fightingcontract with the Pentagon while Peru and Guatemala have hiredAmerican civilian pilots.   Americans are flying five helicopters in Peru and two aircraftto spray fields in Guatemala, the officials said.   The disclosure followed the Knight-Ridder story that said theState Department had amassed a force of 150 aircraft and planned touse U.S. civilian pilots to fly armed missions against drug tradersin Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia.   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley called the story an``exaggeration.'' She and Catherine Shaw of the department'sInternational Narcotics Office then disclosed the Pentagon contractwith Bolivia and the hiring of civilian pilots in Peru andGuatemala.   But Mrs. Oakley said the 29 helicopters and planes acquired onorder to combat drugs ``are not for combat. They are not used foraggressive actions like bombing airstrips or cocaine laboratories.I am not aware of plans for their future use in that regard.''   In all, 16 U.S. helicopters and planes are in South Americancountries to combat drugs, the officials said. But except for thesix helicopters in Bolivia, none has weapons mounted aboard, Mrs.Oakley said.   She said, however, that local law enforcement agents may becarrying weapons aboard those aircraft.   The Knight-Ridder story identified Ann B. Wrobleski, theassistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters,as ``commander in chief of the air wing.''   Aides to Mrs. Wrobleski said she was attending an internationaldrug conference in The Hague that was not open to the press andcould not be reached for comment.   Mrs. Oakley called the story ``an exaggeration and anoverdramatization of the congressional mandated role of thedepartment'' in combating drugs.   The six helicopters in Bolivia are Huey models, each one able tocarry a crew of three and eight passengers. The M60 machine gunsare mounted in doorways on swivels.   Ms. Shaw of the international narcotics office said Boliviaarmed the helicopters under a contract with the Defense Department.   In all, she said, the United States has title to 29 helicoptersand planes in the anti-drug wing, not the 150 reported byKnight-Ridder.   Of these, Ms. Shaw said, five Bell helicopters have beendelivered to Peru, six Hughes helicopters to Bolivia, a C123 Cargoplane to Peru, two agricultural spray planes to Guatemala and twoto Colombia.   She said the two in Colombia may be flown by American civilians,as well, but she was not certain.   Two other planes are used for training, while the others in thewing of 29 will be delivered later, the State Department officialsaid.   Congress authorized $55 million for the operation. Under a 1986law, the United States must maintain title to the planes.Previously, American planes would be turned over to other countriesto use in their campaigns against narcotics.</TEXT></DOC>
