In addition, Southern New England Telephone Co., a unit ofSouthern New England Telecommunications Corp., which servesConnecticut, also reported flat earnings, and Centel Corp.,based in Chicago, reported a 44% drop in net income.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;U S West is weathering the recession the best of thegroup, largely because it is the least dependent on thebusiness sector for growth,&quot; said Daniel Reingold, atelecommunications analyst at Morgan Stanley. Other BabyBells' earnings trends, he said, &quot;range from slightlydisappointing to very disappointing.&quot; Many analysts see alackluster year ahead for the Bells because their comeback islikely to lag the general economy.   All of the Baby Bells felt the impact of cuts ininterstate access charges associated with the FederalCommunications Commission's adoption of &quot;price cap&quot;regulation.   U S West                                                                                                          The Denver company said revenue from telephone operationswas relatively flat as rate reductions erased gains fromgrowth in access lines and calling volume. Dick McCormick, US West's president and chief executive officer, said thecompany &quot;experienced solid revenue growth&quot; in non-telephonebusinesses, including cellular phone operations and directorypublishing. The number of cellular customers rose 46% to223,000. Capital expenditures rose 22%, reflecting networkimprovement projects.   Revenue rose 1% to $2.44 billion from $2.42 billion theyear before. U S West said that the number of customertelephone lines grew 2.9% to 12.7 million at the end of thequarter from 12.3 million at the end of the 1990 period.Minutes of long-distance calling rose 9%.   U S West's per-share earnings remained flat at 73 centsbecause the company offered 16.1 million shares of commonlast May.                                                                                                          Bell Atlantic                                                                                                          Revenue for the quarter for the Philadelphia Baby Belldeclined slightly to $3 billion from $3.02 billion the yearbefore, primarily as a result of lower investment levels atits financial services group. Chairman Raymond Smith saidthat &quot;Key business volumes in our telephone companiescontinued to grow, although at a slower rate than in thefirst quarter of 1990, due to recession.&quot;   The recession also damped cellular phone usage andcellular customer growth as well as business volumes at thecompany's Business Systems Services unit. Over the past 12months, the company added about 63,000 new cellular phonesubcribers, bringing the total to 270,000. Operating expenseswere $2.31 billion, compared with $2.36 billion.   The number of customer telephone lines grew 2% to 17.6million at the end of the first quarter compared with totalaccess lines at the end of the 1990 quarter. Interstateminutes of use rose 5.2%.                                                                                                          BellSouth                                                                                                          Gains in business volumes partly offset revenue reductionsunder new state and federal regulatory plans at this BabyBell, based in Atlanta. &quot;Although we continued to seeincreases in some business volumes during the first quarter,previously announced rate reductions and declining economicconditions adversely affected our results,&quot; said JohnClendenin, BellSouth's chairman and chief executive.   Revenue was $3.54 billion, up from $3.52 billion a yearearlier. At the same time, expenses rose 2.7%. The number ofcustomer telephone lines in service at the end of the firstquarter rose 3% to 17.7 million compared with a year earlier.   Nonregulated businesses, such as cellular phone and pagingservices, continued to gain, though at a somewhat slowerpace.   Nynex                                                                                                          The weak economy in the Northeast continued to hurt Nynex,based in New York, which stepped up its cost containmenteffort by announcing a new management retirement incentiveplan targeting 1,200 to 1,500 managers. &quot;The softness in theeconomy continues to be reflected in reduced demand fortelecommunications products and services,&quot; said WilliamFerguson, chairman and chief executive. He added, however,that service improvements, cost cutting, and organizationalchanges are putting Nynex on track for long-term growth oncethe economy improves.   Telephone revenue growth was flat, with total customertelephone lines rising a modest 1.7% to 15.3 million comparedwith the year before. The cellular business was also weak,with operating income for the first quarter dropping 38.8% to$9.3 million as customers cut back on usage of their cellularphones and operating expenses rose. The number of cellularcustomers at the end of the quarter rose to 267,221 from228,984 a year earlier.   ---                           1991             1990                        in      per      in      per     %                     millions  share  millions  share   chg.
