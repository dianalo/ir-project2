Telephone number (202) 732-4194.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Secretary amends the rules governingthe collection of debts arising under programs administered by the Departmentof Education by offset against payments of salary of a Federal employee,or against amounts payable to a former Federal employee or the beneficiaryof such an employee from an account under the Civil Service RetirementSystem or Federal Employee Retirement System, referred to generally inthe rules as the Federal retirement account of the employee. These rulessimplify and expedite the current salary offset procedures by making themmore consistent with those used under Part 30 for collection by offsetagainst Federal income tax refunds. The revised regulations are consistentwith the requirements of the Debt Collection Act and of government-wideregulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), exceptthat employees are given 65 days to respond to the pre-offset notice, ratherthan the 30 days required under the Act and under OPM rules.The rationale for the adoption of these rules is stated in the preambleto the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, at 53 FR 15336-15337. With minorexceptions, the final regulations are those rules described in the NPRM;that rationale is therefore adopted here by reference.Only one written comment was received in response to the NPRM. The commenter,an institution participating in the Perkins Loan Program under title IVpart E of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, suggested thatthe Secretary assist institutions of higher education in collecting defaultedPerkins loans held by the institutions by salary offset under these rules.Perkins loans are made by institutions from a fund composed of Federaland institutional capital contributions, and the Department has an equitableinterest in these loans; however, the loans are payable to the institution,and the United States has no right to payment on its own account unlessthe institution relinquishes its interest in the loan and assigns the loanto the Department. Because the statute authorized salary offset only tocollect debts to which the United States is entitled to be repaid, 5 U.S.C.5514(a)(1), the Secretary declines to adopt the suggested use of salaryoffset for loans not yet assigned to the Department.The Secretary has revised andSection;andSection; 31.4(c), 31.5(a)(2), and 31.10(c)slightly to clarify the effect of a failure by the employee to meet deadlinesin this part. First, these changes clarify that the Department providesthe documents, hearing, or opportunity to resolve payment of the debt byagreement to any employee who so requests, whether or not the request ismade within the deadlines in this part. Second, consistent with 5 CFR 550.1104(d)(9),if the employee makes a request for a hearing after the deadlines in theseregulations, the Department delays the start of an offset, or suspendsan offset already commenced, only if the employee provides proof satisfactoryto the Department that the employee lacked notice of the proposed offset,or that factors beyond the control of the employee prevented him or herfrom making the request for a hearing, until the deadline had passed. However,the Department will routinely send pre-offset notices both to the residenceand the work address of the employee. Therefore, a debtor currently employedby a Federal agency who claims lack of notice must demonstrate more thana mere change of home address in order to show that delay or suspensionof the offset is justified. The Secretary has adopted a sixty-five dayperiod for requesting a hearing, more than twice as long as that mandatedin the statute and in OPM rules, in order to minimize the likelihood thatfactors over which the employee may lack control, including misrouted ordelayed mail, illness, or absence from one's residence on travel or vacation,would significantly prejudice the ability to make a timely request fora hearing. The Secretary therefore expects that only in the most unusualcircumstances will he exercise this discretion to defer or suspend an offsetfor an employee who does not request relief in a timely manner under theserules. The Secretary reconsidered the provision of andSection; 31.5.(d) of the NPRMthat would have required employees who were offered oral hearings to confirmwithin ten days of the date of the offer that they would appear for a scheduledhearing; this period has been lengthened in this final rule to allow 15days for employees to confirm their intention to appear. 34 CFR 31.5(d).In addition, the Secretary has adopted, for consistency, the definitionof agency used in the OPM regulations, 5 CFR 550.1103, and made conformingrevisions to the definitions of agency and employee in these rules. 34CFR 31.2.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291.
