As the weak hurricane's remnants slipped out of Texas and intoLouisiana and Arkansas on Monday, the Gulf Coast island city ofabout 62,000 quickly returned to normal. Crews picked up downedpower lines and trees, and only one school was closed by a powerfailure.   ``We've had much more serious storms,'' Galveston Mayor JanCoggeshall said. ``But for the people who did have damage, it wasvery serious for them.''   Jerry, a relatively small hurricane, grew unexpectedly from atropical storm to a hurricane early Sunday and roared ashore laterthat night with winds gusting to 100 mph.   As it swept across Galveston Island, Jerry toppled trees andpower lines, tore off roofs and shattered windows in cars andhomes. The hurricane also spawned a half-dozen tornadoes in thearea, but damage generally was confined to roofs and power lines.   Damage was estimated between $5 million and $8.25 million afterground and aerial surveys Monday, Ms. Coggeshall said.   Power was restored Monday for most of about 75,000 HoustonLighting andamp; Power Co. customers who lost at the height of the storm.   The hurricane also churned up the Houston Ship Channel,crumpling four Houston Lighting andamp; Power transmission towers builtto withstand 90 mph winds. Customers were not seriously affected,but downed wires halted traffic on the ship channel, which likelywould be closed until today, utility spokeswoman Geri Konigsbergsaid.   Three people were killed when a pickup apparently was swept offGalveston's protective seawall Sunday. The bodies of a 26-year-oldCoast Guardsman and his 2-year-old daughter were found Sunday onthe seawall's rock jetties; the body of a 19-year-old CoastGuardsman was found Monday.   Though Jerry barely brushed Louisiana, it stirred up enoughwaves to eat away more of the delicate coastline of the barrierisland and popular resort community of Grand Isle. Mayor AndyValence said he would request federal and state help to build morejetties in vulnerable areas.   ``We're so sensitive, so vulnerable that when the water hits ourvery soft sand, it just crumbles and disappears,'' Valence said.   He said high tides were only about 2.3 feet above normal, butmore than four feet of beach was eroded in some areas.</TEXT></DOC>
