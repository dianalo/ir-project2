And the scrapbook of the '80s could hardly be complete without acollection of out-of-focus instant photographs of long-heldhostages in Lebanese captivity, sent out from time to time by menwaging what they deem to be holy war.   For most of the decade there have been American hostages in theMiddle East. The names and faces have changed, but not the torment.   Ten years ago there were 52, in Tehran, and the hostage impassewas a crisis that helped undo a president, ending only as anothercame to office.   Now there are eight, in Beirut, and the air of crisis has longsince yielded to a grim, seldom spoken concession that for all itsmight, there seems to be nothing the United States can do to forcethe safe release of its people.   The standing government statement is a demand thathostage-takers and their sponsors free all the captives, and thatthe United States is pursuing every possible avenue to that end.   But there are no known avenues.   President Bush calls the situation one of enormous frustration.``It's on my mind an awful lot,'' he said in a review of his firstyear in office.   The U.S. hostages are among 18 Westerners kidnapped and believedheld in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent ofThe Associated Press, has been held longer than any other hostage _nearly five years now. He was seized in Beirut on March 16, 1985.   They are held by militant Shiite Moslems aligned with Iran, withdifferent factions claiming to control groups of hostages. Andersonand Thomas Sutherland are held by a group calling itself IslamicJihad, or holy war. It has made one demand from the beginning,offering to free them in exchange for 15 Shiite Moslems jailed inKuwait for terrorist bombings.   The administration stands firm on the no-deals policy declaredby Ronald Reagan, who secretly breached it with the Iranarms-for-hostages dealings disclosed in 1986.   The new Iranian government said at one point last fall that itwould seek to help gain the hostages' release if the United Stateswould free assets frozen during the Tehran hostage crisis. Assetsdisputes are in the hands of an international tribunal in TheHague, which has been releasing funds it determines to belong toIran. The administration insists there is no link, although afterone decision releasing assets to Iran, Bush said he hoped it mighthelp the situation.   It hasn't so far. Nor have administration suggestions ofimproved relations that could benefit Iran should the hostages bereleased.   One American hostage, Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, was killed,and his captors issued a photograph of his hanging body last summerafter Israel kidnapped a Shiite leader in southern Lebanon. WhileBush denounced the brutality, there was no retaliation. He was saidto have been preparing reprisals in the event death threats againsta second hostage were carried out.   But the plight of the other American hostages limits U.S.options.   A week after he took office, Reagan had said he wouldn't standfor hostage episodes. ``Our policy will be one of swift andeffective retribution,'' he said in welcoming the Tehran embassyhostages seized on Nov. 4, 1979, and held until his inaugurationday, Jan. 20, 1981.   It was a warning on which he could not deliver when his ownhostage problems began three years later with the kidnappings inLebanon.   Lacking options or answers, Bush has uttered no such warnings,and has played down the hostage situation he inherited.   The number is small, the victims are isolated and unseen. It isan unrelenting problem, but not a crisis forcing its way onto thenational agenda.   Nevertheless, the haunting figures of Americans held hostagestand as symbols of the 1980s, and as unfinished business in thenew year.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
