This new technique, in combination withthe theoryfor the calculation of the resonance frequency spectrum ofa rectangularparallelepiped specimen, enables us to determine the high-temperatureelastic properties of single-crystal materials. The first applicationof this new device was to determine the elastic stiffness constants ofsingle-crystal corundum up to 1825 K.</TEXT></DOC>
