Eleven dead in Mitchell's Plain, four dead in Lavender Hill, two dead in Khayelitsha. In all, church groups said 25 people died (police confirmed 12 deaths) and more than 100 were injured in the black townships around Cape Town Wednesday night and Thursday morning, just as white voters were returning Mr. de Klerk's National Party to power, albeit with a greatly reduced majority. The promised &quot;new South Africa&quot; looked distressingly like the old one.    &quot;Mr. de Klerk's president's seat sits now in a pool of blood,&quot; said the Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent opponent of apartheid, the government's system of racial segregation. &quot;If he doesn't move quickly, nothing that he says, politically or otherwise, will have any meaning whatsoever.&quot;    One day after the election, the clock is already ticking away double-time on Mr. de Klerk's campaign promises to scrap the remnants of apartheid and to begin negotiations on a new constitution that will bring the black majority into national politics for the first time.    Expectations are high, both here and abroad, that Mr. de Klerk will move swiftly to carry out these reforms after he is formally elected president by the white parliament next week. Should he delay, or outright renege, the election-night violence could turn out to be the prelude to another cycle of unrest, similar to the one between 1984 and 1986 that culminated in the government declaring the present state of emergency. Also, the international sanctions that were prompted by the emergency, and which have severely strained the country's economy, would surely intensify.    Even though the National Party lost 30 seats in this week's election (it now has 93 out of 166), Mr. de Klerk called the results a &quot;clear mandate&quot; for his reform goals. Pushing for even more extensive reform is the liberal Democratic Party, which increased its strength in the white parliament to 33 from 20 seats. The pro-apartheid Conservative Party, which bitterly opposes any concessions to blacks, posted the biggest gains, winning 17 additional seats for a total of 39. However, the Conservatives didn't do as well as they predicted they would, and most political analysts believe the party's support has peaked at about 32% of the white electorate.    &quot;Seventy percent of the whites voted for parties favoring renewal and reform . . . and granting political rights,&quot; Mr. de Klerk said a news conference. Still, he wouldn't say how, or where, he would begin, referring only to his party's five-year &quot;action plan,&quot; a document filled with grand rhetoric but few specifics.    The plan is vague enough to leave Mr. de Klerk with two paths toward reform. The first is the well-worn road of the National Party, which involves trying to co-opt the country's more moderate black leaders into separate political structures that would enable the whites to maintain control. The second is a pioneering trail that accepts the inevitability of majority rule and negotiations with black movements, like the African National Congress, about genuine power-sharing. Both, undoubtedly, lead to the risk of more resistance, the first from anti-apartheid activists, the second from right-wing white vigilantes.    The election results, which showed a trend to the left, combined with other pressures, may steer Mr. de Klerk toward the more adventurous path. For everywhere he turns, he hears the same mantra of demands -- release, lift bans, dismantle, negotiate -- be it from local anti-apartheid activists or from foreign governments: release political prisoners, like African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela; lift bans on all political organizations, such as the ANC, the Pan Africanist Congress and the United Democratic Front; dismantle all apartheid legislation; and finally, begin negotiations with leaders of all races.    International bankers, who are coming under mounting pressure from anti-apartheid activists not to reschedule the $8 billion of South African foreign debt that starts falling due in mid-1990, are looking for signs from the government that it will begin acting on these demands. And so are some members of the U.S. Congress, who say they are willing to give Mr. de Klerk a couple of months, perhaps until the beginning of next year, before pushing ahead with stricter sanctions measures.    Furthermore, when Commonwealth leaders gather in Kuala Lumpur Oct. 18, the African members -- as well as Australia and Canada -- will press British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to abandon her anti-sanctions stand.    Internally, the many anti-apartheid organizations, under the umbrella of the Mass Democratic Movement, vow to continue defying apartheid laws and state-of-emergency restrictions. The first flashpoint could come Oct. 7, when the umbrella group has scheduled a nationwide anti-apartheid conference to work out a position on talks with the government, should they ever occur.    &quot;We won't accept the old way of being ruled in this country,&quot; says Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest black labor federation. &quot;We are taking our future into our own hands. We will eliminate apartheid on our own. They can either join us, or respond with violence.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
