The program will replace a series of five-year, Reaganadministration steel trade pacts that expire Saturday.   Negotiators in the office of U.S. Trade Representative CarlaHills have been meeting this week to finalize pacts with theEuropean Community and other leading steel-exporting nations,including Japan, South Korea and Mexico.   Now, it is up to Congress to pass legislation implementing theprogram. A bill containing President Bush's proposal to extend thepacts passed the House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday, but hasyet to be considered by the full House or the Senate.   ``Congress needs to get a new program enacted as soon aspossible to prevent steel-exporting countries from taking advantageof the situation,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., a sponsor ofthe bill. ``We don't want to send the world a signal that it isalright to begin dumping steel in the U.S. again.''   She said the sponsors have adopted an informal ``no-amendment''rule because ``if we start to tinker with it again, the whole thingcould unravel.''   The Reagan program lasted five years, but the scaled-down Bushversion only lasts 2{ years.   U.S. Trade negotiators had a difficult time in 1984 getting somesteel-exporting nations to agree to annual, product-by-productceilings on the volume of steel to be shipped to the United States.   Those negotiations took six months, but Williams said pactrenewals could be signed by Sunday even though traderepresentatives were given only 45 days this time around.   ``There is no country with which we are dealing that I am notconvinced will enter into a voluntary restraint agreement and aconsensus agreement on time,'' Williams said.   In the consensus agreements, nations are being asked by the Bushadministration to commit to steps designed to remove governmentsubsidies or other barriers to free steel trade.   Steel labor is backing the Bush program, but has doubts aboutwhether a meaningful consensus on free trade can be achieved.   ``We have many reservations about whether that's possible,''United Steelworkers President Lynn Williams said in an interviewThursday. He is not related to his Bush administration namesake.   The steelworkers had pushed for an extension of five years _ not2{ _ of the product-by-product pacts. But the union leader said,``We don't want to undercut the president's program. We'll wait andsee how it plays out.''</TEXT></DOC>
