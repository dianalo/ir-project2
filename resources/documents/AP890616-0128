Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said PresidentBush deplores the persecutions of Chinese demonstrators but has nocurrent plans to impose further sanctions on China.   Two diplomats in San Francisco last week were given U.S.permission to remain in the country. A State Department officialspeaking on condition of anonymity said today ``there have beenadditional Chinese officials who have asked for protection in theUnited States.''   Such diplomats are covered under Bush's recent order that grantsany Chinese citizen permission to stay in the United States untilJune 1990, the official said.   The Chinese diplomats have not formally asked for asylum, butcould do so in the future, the official said.   He source declined to specify the number of Chinese diplomatsinvolved, and said he could not confirm a report that two diplomatsin the Chinese Embassy in Washington had sought such protection.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has been negotiating withChinese Ambassador Han Xu to resolve a dispute over the Chinesedissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, who are being shielded in theU.S. Embassy in Beijing.   Speaking of administration plans with regard to China, WhiteHouse press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We continue to watchthe situation. We'll continue to measure it as we go forward.Sanctions are always a part of that review, but we have nothing toannounce.''   Fitzwater, speaking a day after the Chinese government sentencedsome protesters to death, declined to characterize Bush's reactionto the current effort by Beijing to rewrite the story of the bloodyprotest and its claim that no demonstrators were killed.   But he said anyone who has seen the television reports knows whathappened, despite the Chinese propoganda attempts.   ``Those matters all speak for themselves ... The pictures and thereality of the reporting has been so dramatic that these kind ofefforts stand beside them so starkly that I wouldn't even want totry to diminish that by giving it words,'' Fitzwater said.   Fitzwater read from a prepared statement, saying, ``Thepersecution of people for the exercise of basic human rights such asthe freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of thepress is of course deplorable.''   Further, he said, ``The aspirations expressed by the peoplekilled in Tiananmen Square and those who are being persecuted todaywill not be stilled by harsh repression.''   ``We believe that dialogue and reform, not arrests and showtrials, are the route which offer the best hope for stability inChina.''   The comments bolstered those of a top administration officialThursday that the United States still can do business with Chineseleader Deng Xiaoping despite his military crackdown and the massacreof hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of people.   Bush has been reluctant to affix blame for China's bloodshed buthas said it would be ``extraordinarily difficult'' for the UnitedStates to have normal relations with officials responsible for themassacre of students and workers participating in pro-democracyprotests.   However, the administration official, a top policymaker in Bush'sinner circle who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S. tieswith China involve ``a very important relationship with a veryimportant country.''   Despite the crackdown, the official said, ``China has come a longway since 1972'' when Washington re-established ties with Beijing.The official called China ``a great, important country in the world,and we have great stakes there.''   ``I think they have made a decision that they're going to restoreorder and that they're going to try to rediscipline the system,''the official said. ``It is not so clear that they have made a majorreversal in course and will not resume a path like they were onbefore. I think it's premature to make that decision.''   The official appeared open to continued contacts with Deng,China's senior leader, who has praised the military for its bloodyassault against Chinese citizens.   ``He is the head of a very major country. There are lots of headsof government and state who do things that we don't like that we dobusiness with,'' the official said.   ``Are you suggesting we should not have done any business with(Soviet leaders Nikita) Khrushchev, (Leonid) Brezhnev, anybody whohas done anything wrong?'' the official asked.   Saying it was premature to say China has abandoned reforms, theofficial added, ``It is not so clear that they have made a majorreversal in course and will not resume a path like they were onbefore.''</TEXT></DOC>
