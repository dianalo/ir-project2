Pronouncing themselves disappointed after a six-day trip toSouth Africa that included a meeting with President F.W.de Klerk,the lawmakers said all the significant components of the apartheidsystem of racial inequality remained in place.   ``The government seems to be clinging to the fantasy thatsomehow conflict in South Africa can be reduced and the pressuresfrom without will be eased while the white minority continues tohold to power and privilege,'' said Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich.,chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa.   Unless far-reaching reforms are made soon, ``there will be agrowing movement in the Congress and internationally to intensifysanctions,'' said Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo.   The Africa subcommittee will begin hearings next month onproposals to further restrict U.S.-South African economic ties,Wolpe said. Congress in 1986 barred the importation of SouthAfrican coal, steel and agricultural products, imposed bankingrestrictions and cut direct air links between the two countries.   Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., has introduced a bill that wouldprohibitvirtually any commercial links with South Africa. A versionof the bill cleared the House in 1988 but died in the Senate,lacking the support of Republicans who had backed the 1986sanctions.   Another House bill would impose credit restrictions.   The Bush administration has spoken against tightening sanctionsas long as de Klerk, who assumed power in August, appears to bemoving toward reform. But Wolpe said he was encouraged by theattitude of administration officials who had agreed to discuss thematter.   ``We've been speaking much more with one voice'' than during theReagan administration, which had an ideological aversion tosanctions, Wolpe said.   There have been improvements since de Klerk assumed power inAugust, said Wolpe, Wheat and Rep. Constance Morella, R-Md., whowere in South Africa Jan. 4-9. Some political prisoners have beenfreed and the government is allowing opposition rallies, they saidin a joint statement.   But hundreds of political prisoners remain in jail, some underdeath sentences, and politically motivated trials continue, theysaid. Likewise, purported relaxation of speech restrictions havebeen offset by harassment of opposition voices in the media, theysaid.   For that reason, even the expected release of jailed AfricanNational Congress leader Nelson Mandela would be little more than a``public relations gimmick'' without genuine reforms, Wheat said.   There is ``an enormous gap between some of the highly publicizedinitiatives taken and the much broader reality that is still inplace,'' Wolpe said.   He said discussions with leaders of a cross-section of SouthAfrican society, including government and opposition figures, ledthe Americans to believe forms of persecution were getting worse.   There have been recent reports of political assassinations bydeath squads ``that appear to be operating under the direction andsanction of police and government authorities,'' Wolpe said.   De Klerk has said he wants to negotiate a new constitution thatwould bring blacks into the national government within five years.However, he opposes black majority rule and envisions a mechanismthat would give whites veto power on major policy decisions.</TEXT></DOC>
