Seven out of ten vehicles had a first-testparticulate emission level lower than a predetermined cutoff point of0.35 g/mi. (The California PM certification standard for 1985 light-dutydiesel vehicles is 0.4 g/mi.) Attempts were made to regenerate the particulate-trapoxidizers on the three vehicles that exceeded the 0.35 g/mi PM leveland the vehicles were retested. Two of three retested vehicles passedthe PM cutoff level.</TEXT></DOC>
