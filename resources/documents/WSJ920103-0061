Accustomed to leading the nation's growth,California is suffering economic decline and a public-sectorbudget crunch. Accustomed also to setting political trends,the state heads toward a November election that may settlecritical issues for years ahead.   Politicians in Sacramento face, belatedly, the need to putpublic expenditures on a Jenny Craig-size diet. Economically,California needs to stanch the outflow of small and midsizebusinesses that have been its lifeblood. While the electionwill come too late to restore robustness in 1992, when thevote comes it will be a seminal referendum. The elements:</LP><TEXT>   Goodbye, Gerrymander. The state supreme court has resolveda deadlock between the Republican governor and legislativeDemocrats by drawing new districts for the people'srepresentatives that have in mind the people and not therepresentatives. This should give full measure to GOPstrength, just as the ballot qualification of a new GreenParty threatens more havoc for the Democrats.   Welfare Check. The revived conservatism of Gov. PeteWilson's rhetoric puts state politics in a new light. After adismal year in which he played to the wishes of statistpoliticians and media and lost his taxpaying support base,Mr. Wilson now defines the world in terms of those whoreceive government benefits vs. those who provide them. He'stargeting the AFDC program in a ballot initiative. In directdollars, welfare is a small piece of California's spendingproblem but it leads to much else. Analysts see Mr. Wilson'splan lopping 25% off the state's high benefits, offering lessstill to newcomers from lower-paying parts of the U.S. anddiscouraging teen-age mothers from starting welfarehouseholds by not letting the checks follow them to a newhome.   This could begin to dent the double-digit percentageincreases in social-service spending in California,especially if it tamed the out-of-control Medicaid tiger. Tohelp do that, the governor's initiative also empowers hisoffice to make other spending cuts, without legislativeapproval, when the budget is seriously out of balance (as atpresent).   Choice Voice. Another ballot item will give Californiaparents of moderate income an escape from the educationbureaucratic Blob. A proposition hatched by entrepreneurialbusiness interests would offer parents a $2,600 voucher foreach child taught outside of the public schools. This is themost fundamental reform likely to be decided in any electionnext fall.   Powerful teachers' unions and those within the sway of theschool establishment are gearing up for a fierce fight todefeat it. Nothing less than California's future work force,even its civic culture, can be said to ride on the outcome.The result is likely to depend on how concerned the state'saffluent voters are about the other half of the population,whose torments they rarely share.   Faulting Lawyers. The trial-attorney grip on the statelegislature is a part of its basic corruption, and nowheredoes this hit Californians more squarely in the pocketbookthan in auto insurance. RAND's Institute for Civil Justicehas added its weight to the case for a no-fault alternativeto the current litigation-driven system. Savings of perhaps20% are projected from limiting legal fees and thewealth-redistribution device known as &quot;pain and suffering.&quot; Acore group is deciding this week on taking the matter to theelectorate and around the committee roadblocks of AssemblySpeaker Willie Brown's henchmen.   Tax Redux. No California polling would be complete withouta revenue question or two. At present, at least a pair areexpected: one to repeal the sales tax on &quot;snacks&quot; thatGovernor Wilson got enacted, and another to prevent the useof public-pension funds to balance the state budget. Theremay also be attempts to stiffen or loosen requirements forvoter approval of local taxes and fees.   Ominously, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear acase asserting that Proposition 13 violates the Constitutionbecause owners who recently bought property have to payhigher taxes than longtime owners. A ruling overturning thelaw would unleash the Godzilla of the tax revolt, rearrangingCalifornia's entire fiscal picture and forcing a battle thatwould dwarf everything else on this most memorable ballot.   That's more than enough for any democracy to handle in oneyear (along with the chore of electing a President of theUnited States). At least California broadcasters needn'tworry about their advertising sales come fall's balloting,though like everyone else they'll have to pay bills and meetpayrolls in the intervening, and unsettled, year. Yetsometimes the benefits of a contested election are realizedeven before it's held. And recent experience suggests thatthe rest of the nation will feel the influence of the choicesCalifornia makes at its current crossroads.</TEXT></DOC>
