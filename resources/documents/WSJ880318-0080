The new unit, Rangeline Corp., will concentrate initially on arranging procurement of gas supplies and transportation services, for customers of the parent company, Kansas Pandamp;L said. The company added that Rangeline will engage primarily in unregulated activities, including arranging natural gas or fuel oil sales, gas transportation, cogeneration planning and energy consulting services.    The unit was established to take advantage of the deregulation of the natural gas market that has occurred during the past several years, the company said.    Kansas Pandamp;L is a utility company that serves more than one million gas customers in Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Nebraska and 300,000 electricity customers in Kansas. </TEXT></DOC>
