Researchers will use their terminals to send messages at anyhour to electronic ``mailboxes.'' The messages can be retrieved atany time by other members of the seminar sponsored by the Instituteof Space Sciences in Moscow, part of the Soviet Academy ofSciences, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Researchin Boulder, Colo.   The opening ceremonial exchange between Washington and Moscowwas timed to coincide with a two-day, face-to-face conference onglobal warming in Moscow sponsored by the institute, thecorporation, the U.S. Natural Resources Defense Council and theInstitute for Resource Management, an environmental researchorganization headed by actor Robert Redford.   The computer exchanges will be ``a lot more collegial than yourtypical international conference,'' permitting the informal sharingof tentative ideas, trying out of approaches and asking ``whatif?'' questions, said Irving Mintzner of the World ResourcesInstitute, one of the researchers taking part.   The World Resources Institute was host to the Washingtonceremonies.   The electronic set-up is ``a workshop, I like to say,''commented Elena Loshchenkova, senior staff scientist of the Moscowinstitute.   One of the organizers of the electronic seminar, formerastronaut Russell Schweickart, said a real conference would takeweeks to organize and would cost at least 10 times more ``for thesame productivity.''   Last year, Schweickart, Walter Orr Roberts, retired president ofthe University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, and Roald Z.Sagdeev, director of the institute in Moscow, were blocked fromusing Apple Corp.'s Macintosh computers in the Soviet Union becausethe Pentagon considered that machine's graphics programs toosensitive to provide to a potential adversary.   Climate scientists are big users of computer graphics becausetheir results frequently take the form of global maps.   The organizers decided to go ahead using machines compatiblewith IBM Corp. personal computers, which have less advancedgraphics capability than the Apple machines.   But recently the export ban on Macintosh was lifted, and ``fouror five'' have been taken to the Soviet Union for use in theprogram, Schweickart said.   The electronic seminar is being supported by a grant from theRockefeller Brothers Fund. The seminar also has free use of1,050-word per minute satellite and land circuits of the EuropeanSpace Agency linking the United States, Europe and the Soviet Union.   Asked if the exchanges would be monitored by the twogovernments, Schweickart said, ``Who knows and, in part, whocares?''   The ``greenhouse effect'' refers to the buildup of gases in theatmosphere that trap heat normally radiated out to space. The mostimportant of these gases is carbon dioxide resulting from theburning of fossil fuels.   U.S. scientists generally agree that sometime in the nextcentury the average temperature of the earth will be three to eightdegrees Fahrenheit warmer than it is now.</TEXT></DOC>
