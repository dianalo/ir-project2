The decision Friday stemmed from a lawsuit the National SecurityArchive, a nonprofit group that compiles documents on nationalsecurity and foreign policies, brought against the DefenseDepartment for its refusal to classify the organization as aneducational institution or a representative of the news media.   Either category would mean the group would not have to paycertain ``search-and-review'' charges for Freedom of InformationAct requests, a potentially substantial benefit. Search-and reviewfees at the State Department, for example, vary from $8 an hour to$30 an hour.   Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, writing the unanimousdecision for the three-member panel, said National Security Archivewas entitled to media status because it planned ``to act, inessence, as a publisher'' for books such as its chronology of theIran-Contra affair and a 1,000-page index of documents about U.S.involvement in El Salvador.</TEXT></DOC>
