When such products are made in bacterial cells,gene constructs that yield large quantities of the desired product areemployed using multicopy bacterial plasmid replicons. The continuingpresence in the cell of a plasmid carrying the desired genes commonlycan be assured by the addition of a selectable gene to the plasmid repliconand by growth selection under selective conditions. This review of plasmid,partitioning is intended to point out that the plasmid stability is animportant practical consideration in the genetic manipulation of microorganismsthat are to be introduced into the environment. While the mechanismsthat affect plasmid stability are still incompletely understood at themolecular level, the current state of knowledge allows manipulationsthat can achieve either the goal of stable inheritance or the goal ofunstable inheritance, if desired. It is hoped that the next few yearswill lead to more information at the mechanistic level.</TEXT></DOC>
