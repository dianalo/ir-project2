A quite important branch of this cycle is played by the managementof radioactive waste. In Brazil there are one nuclear power plant inoperation (626 MWe); mining and milling industry, a fuel fabricationplant; three nuclear research institutes including a radioisotope productionfacility; some accelerators and about 2000 institutions (medicine, industry,agriculture, research centers etc) widespread throughout the countryutilizing radionuclides on a large scale. In Brazil there is not a definedfinal repository to receive the radioactive waste produced in the country.Instead, all radioactive wastes produced must be treated insuch a waythat: - The volume of the waste is minimized as much as possible - Therelease of radionuclides into the environment is as low as possible -The radioactive materials are immobilized for storage over long periodssafely and preventing them to contact the biocycle. Discussions are madeconcerning the Brazilian policy and the waste treatment research programcarried out by the Instituto de Pesquisas Energeticas e Nucleares (IPEN),scientific branch of the National Comission of Nuclear Energy (CNEN).</TEXT></DOC>
