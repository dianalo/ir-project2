General Partners threatened to call a special meeting to replace the GenCorp board and to consider other proposals if it isn't allowed to compete with other possible bids.    General Partners, formed by AFG Industries Inc. and Wagner andamp; Brown to acquire Akron, Ohio-based GenCorp, made a $2.2 billion, or $100 a share, tender offer on March 17. GenCorp has said that it is evaluating the offer. The company is expected to make a comment on the bid at its annual meeting tomorrow. AFG is an Irvine, Calif.-based glass-making concern. Wagner andamp; Brown is a Midland, Texas, oil and gas company.    In the letter sent late Friday, General Partners reiterated an earlier comment that it might be willing to negotiate a higher price &quot;if (GenCorp) can demonstrate additional value to us.&quot;    A spokesman for GenCorp declined to comment on the General Partners letter.    The letter said that General Partners is aware that GenCorp may be reviewing &quot;alternative transactions which provide the GenCorp shareholders with consideration other than cash.&quot; The letter added that General Partners may have enough equity capital to offer cash and securities with a greater value than GenCorp could provide in such alternative transactions.    &quot;We also believe that GenCorp's board has an obligation to present any alternative transaction it may propose to the GenCorp shareholders in an environment permitting any other offerer, including ourselves, to compete.&quot;    General Partners asked that it &quot;be given access without restriction to the same information available to GenCorp's managers and advisers in constructing&quot; any alternative proposal GenCorp may be considering. General Partners also requested that it be given an opportunity to bid on a &quot;competitively equal and fair basis&quot; should GenCorp propose to accept another buyer's bid.    General Partners also renewed its request that GenCorp redeem its &quot;poison pill&quot; so that its tender offer, scheduled to expire April 15, can &quot;proceed directly to the shareholders.&quot; Last month, GenCorp's board adopted a rights distribution that would enable GenCorp holders, in the event of a hostile takeover, to buy stock in the surviving company at half price.    The letter also urged GenCorp against combining any alternative proposal &quot;with defensive features designed to discourage or eliminate the possibility of superior competing proposals.&quot;    General Partners holds 2.2 million, or 9.8%, of GenCorp's 22.3 million shares outstanding. GenCorp is involved in tires and plastic products, aerospace and defense products, and broadcasting. </TEXT></DOC>
