Inspections were also carried out to determinethe extent of tampering with emission control systems. Emission levelswere compared to Environment Canada's suggested exhaust emission testlimits, and the effects of tampering on emission levels were assessed.Emissions from the majority of vehicles were found to be within the suggestedlimits. Tampering resulted in significantly higher concentrations ofcarbon monoxide and hydrocarbons in vehicle exhaust. 4 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
