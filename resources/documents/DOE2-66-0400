However, as a result of the growth of multiprocessorcomputer technology during the past ten years, a new class of concurrentprogramming languages have evolved with primitives to create concurrentprocesses and allow them to communicate. This paper describes an adaptionof one such language called Multi-Pascal to describe and simulate neuralnetworks. Each neuron is represented as a concurrent process in the language,and connections between neurons are implemented with interprocess communicationprimitives. The language Multi-Pascal was originally designed for writinghighly parallel application programs for multiprocessor computer systemswith large numbers of processors. The first generation of these multiprocessorsystems is already commercially available at reasonable prices, and representsan ideal hardware vehicle for continuing research in neural network simulation.</TEXT></DOC>
