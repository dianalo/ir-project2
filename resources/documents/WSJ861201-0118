Ceco said the lawsuit, which sought class-action status, was filed in September but served on the company Wednesday. The lawsuit, by Three Bridges Investment Group, alleges that the management group's September offering price of $50.50 a share in cash and debt is &quot;grossly unfair and inadequate&quot; and seeks an injunction to halt the proposed buyout.    Ceco denied the allegation. Attorneys for the stockholders group didn't return phone calls for comment.    The management group, known as MC Co., is led by Erwin Schulze, Ceco's chairman and president, and includes descendents of Ceco's founder, C. Louis Meyer. The group controlled 18% of Ceco's shares at the time of the offer. In addition, Ceco's board approved the offer adding another 7% of the company's shares to the group's control.    MC Co.'s offer included $35.50 cash and junior subordinated debentures with face value of $15 for each Ceco share. The debentures, which won't pay interest for the first five years, are likely to be traded at a discount.    In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with debt that is paid with money generated by the acquired company's operations or through asset sales.    Ceco said Friday that MC Co. obtained a promise of $160 million in credit from five banks for the buyout. In addition the construction company said an investment banking group said it has buyers for an additional $20 million of MC Co.'s senior subordinated debentures and proceeds would be available to MC Co. as needed.    For the six months, Ceco earned $5.4 million, or $1.09 a share, on sales of $321.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
