L. No. 100-670 has made it possiblefor owners of patents directed to new animal drugs and to veterinary biologicalproducts that are not biotechnology-generated to apply for extension ofthe term of such patents in a manner similar to the owners of patents directedto human drugs, food additives, color additives, and medical devices. Anew animal drug or veterinary biological product is biotechnology-generatedif it is primarily manufactured using recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA,hybridoma technology, or other processes including site specific geneticmanipulation techniques. The primary purpose of this rule change is torevise the present regulations contained in 37 CFR Part 1, Subpart F, toinclude the two additional categories of subject matter that can now formthe basis of patent term extension. These regulations set forth proceduresthat govern the content and submission of applications for the extensionof a patent term to the PTO, and procedures governing the extension determinationand issuance of patent term extension certificates by the PTO.Initial guidelines directed to the preparation and filing of applicationsfor patent term extension as authorized by Pub. L. No. 100-670 were publishedas ``Guidelines For Extension of Patent Term For New Animal Drugs or VeterinaryBiological Products Under 35 U.S.C. 156 as Amended'' in the Official Gazette.1097 <T3>Official Gazette </T3>63 (December 27, 1988). A notice of proposedrulemaking was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 7, 1989, at 54 FR 9507 and in the OfficialGazette. 1100 <T3>Official Gazette </T3>128 (March 28, 1989). No oral hearing was conductedon these proposed rules. One written comment was received. The only written comment received was directed to the proposed amendmentto andSection; 1.710(a). The proposed amendment indicated that a patent iseligible for extension of the patent term if the patent claims a producteither alone or in combination with other ingredients that read on a compositionthat received permission for commercial marketing or use. The proposedmodification was objected to because of the implication that patent termextension would not be available for composition patents where the claimedcompositions do not read on the composition (new drug) approved by theFDA. Such an interpretation, it was argued, would unfairly and narrowlyinterpret the statute. The comment noted that where a marketing applicantseeks approval of multiple dosage forms or compositions of a new drug,the right to obtain patent term extension is triggered at the time thefirst new drug application is approved. In a typical situation, an injectabledosage form to be used for acute indications will require a lesser developmenttime and be approved more rapidly than the oral dosage form of the sameactive ingredient intended for chronic administration. It was representedin the comment that justification for the drug development program mighthinge on the expectation of an extension of an oral composition patent.If there were patents on both the injectable dosage form and the oral administrationform containing the same active ingredient, which were mutually exclusivefor the purposes of this illustration, the new drug holder, it is argued,should have a choice of which patent term to extend based on the firstapproval of a new chemical entry (NCE) drug. Finally, the comment suggestedthat the proposed amendment to andSection; 1.710(a) with respect to compositionpatents stands in marked contrast to the situation which applies in thecase of method of use patents. It is alleged, in the comment, that therule in effect allows an extension of a method of use patent whenever theclaimed method of use embraces the use of the active ingredient. Accordingto the comment, where an NCE drug is first approved for the treatment ofarthritis, a patent limited to an analgesic use of the NCE drug may beextended. (Note the requirement in andSection; 1.740(a)(4) to identify theuse for which the product was approved.) These remarks made in this comment raise a substantive issue relating tothe eligibility of patents for patent term extension under 35 U.S.C. 156that is not addressed in the rules. The exercise of the Commissioner'srulemaking authority under 35 U.S.C. 6 and 156 can neither enlarge norreduce the scope of eligibility of a patent for patent term extension under35 U.S.C. 156. Secondly, the proposed amendment to andSection; 1.710(a) isclearly couched in terms which are permissive without either explicitlyor implicitly excluding other possibilities. The proposed amendment wasmade in response to many inquiries received over the years since enactmentof 35 USC 156 as to whether a formulation or composition claim in a patentcould form a basis for eligibility for patent term extension. Finally,the PTO has a long-standing policy of not addressing an issue in advanceof receiving an application presenting the issue for determination. Theissue of whether a patent is eligible for patent term extension that couldnot be enforced in either the original or extended term against the approvedformulation or use that allegedly would give rise to eligibility has notbeen addressed yet by the PTO.PTO experience to date did involve consideration of two applications thatwere filed based on approval of the human drug product OCUFEN OphthalmicSolution, which contains the active ingredient Flurbiprofen [2-(2-fluoro-4-biphenylyl)propionic acid]. Relevant claims from the two patents that were the subjectof the applications for patent term extension were as follows:<ITAG tagnum="16">I. Patent 3,755,427 (issued August 28, 1973)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Claim 2. 2-(2-fluoro-4-biphenylyl)propionic acid.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">II. Patent 3,793,457 (issued February 19, 1974)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Claim 1. </T3>A therapeutic composition useful in the treatment ofpain, inflammation, and pyretic conditions which comprises a compound selectedfrom the group consisting of 2-(2-fluoro-4-biphenylyl) propionic acid,[2-(2andmin172;-fluoro-4-biphenylyl) propionic acid, and 2-(2,2andmin172;-difluoro-4-biphenylyl)propionic acid in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipentthe amount of said compound present in said composition being an amounteffective against at least one of said conditions.</ITAG>Claim 2 of the earlier issued patent is directed to the active ingredientper se, whereas claim 1 of Patent No. 3,793,457 is directed to a formulationwhich can contain Flurbiprofen in an amount which was effective in thetreatment of pain, inflammation, and pyretic conditions.However, since the approved indication for Ocufen was for the inhibitionof intraoperative miosis, it was not immediately apparent to the PTO whetherthe andmin172;457 patent claimed the product within the meaning of 35 U.S.C.156. Our view was that the 1984 Act was intended to restore to those patentowners a portion of the enforceable term of an appropriate patent of theirchoice which was lost due to Government required regulatory review forthe product covered by the patent prior to the commercial marketing ofthe claimed product or the use thereof. If the patent could not be enforcedagainst an infringer who was making, using, or selling an ophthalmic solutioncontaining Flurbiprofen for the treatment of intraoperative miosis, itwas questioned how the restoration of the lost patent term due to the regulatoryprocess for the approved product is appropriate under the statute.In this case, the applicant for patent term extension submitted evidencethat Flurbiprofen, in an amount of 0.0004% to 0.1%, has anti-inflammatoryactivity in the eye when topically administered. The approved label showedthat Ocufen contained 0.03% of the active ingredient and stated that theproduct is ``a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory product for ophthalmicuse.'' The specification of the andmin172;457 patent indicated that usefulcompositions preferably contain 0.1-90% by weight of a compound of theinvention. Thus, the dosage of the active ingredient for the indicateduse clearly overlapped the effective dosages specified in the functionallanguage of claim 1 of the andmin172;457 patent. On the basis of this evidence,the PTO concluded that the later issued patent claimed the product. Asboth patents were determined to be eligible for patent term extension,applicant was permitted to choose the single patent term to be extended.35 U.S.C. 156(c)(4).<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Specific Rules</ITAG>Section 1.710(a) specifically sets forth the existing policy and practicerelating to eligibility of patents claiming a composition or formulationthat includes the active ingredient. A patent is considered to claim theproduct at least in those situations where the patent claims the activeingredient per se, or claims a composition or formulation which containsthe active ingredient(s) and reads on the composition or formulation approvedfor commercial marketing or use.Section 1.710(b) revises the definition of human drug product in paragraph(b)(1) to make the definition conform to Pub. L. No. 100-670. A new paragraph(b)(2) is added to expand the definition of ``product'' in andSection; 1.710(a)to include a new animal drug and a veterinary biological product, but notone that is primarily manufactured using recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA,hybridoma technology, or other processes including site specific geneticmanipulation techniques. Present paragraph (b)(2) is redesignated as paragraph(b)(3). It should be understood that the discussion here of new animaldrugs and veterinary biological products is limited to the animal drugsand products defined in Pub. L. No. 100-670.Paragraph (e)(2) of andSection; 1.720 is revised to indicate that the conditionsgiven therein concern a patent for a product other than one recited inandSection;1.710(b)(2), due to the exclusion of biotechnology-generated newanimal drugs and veterinary biological products in Pub. L. No. 100-670.A new paragraph (e)(3) is added to andSection;1.720 directed to the provisionin 35 U.S.C. 156(a)(5)(C), which permits the term of a patent directedto a new animal drug or veterinary biological product to be extended basedon a second or subsequent approval of the active ingredient provided allthe following conditions exist: (a) The patent claims the drug or product,(b) the drug or product is not covered by the claims in any other patentthat has been extended (``covered by the claims'' means that the drug orproduct would infringe a claim in the other patent), (c) the patent termwas not extended on the basis of the regulatory review period for use innon-food-producing animals, and (d) the second or subsequent approval wasthe first permitted commercial marketing or use of the drug or productfor administration to a food-producing animal. A new portion is added toparagraph (f) directed to the case where eligibility is to be based on35 U.S.C. 156(a)(5)(C). In this latter case, the application must be filedwithin 60 days of the first approval for administration to a food-producinganimal.Paragraph (a)(4) of andSection; 1.740(a) is amended to (1) eliminate ``human''as a modifier for ``product'', (2) add the Public Health Service Act andthe Virus-Serum-Toxin Act to the list of appropriate statutes, and (3)add a requirement to indicate the use for which the product was approved.The first two amendments are necessary to comply with terms of 35 U.S.C.156 as amended, and the third amendment is necessary to a determinationof eligibility where, for example, the application is based on a secondor subsequent approval of an active ingredient, but the first approvalfor administration to a food-producing animal. Paragraph (a)(9) is amendedto eliminate the requirement to set forth the statement, beginning on anew page, that the patent for which patent term extension is sought claimsthe approved product or a method of using or making same, and the requiredshowing listing each applicable claim of the patent and demonstrating themanner in which each applicable claim reads on the approved product ora method of using or making same. This change is made because the informationrequired by this paragraph is within the province of PTO review and thereis no need to have such information recited in a readily segregable sectionof the application. Paragraph (a)(10) is amended to indicate that, as appropriate,the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of Agriculturewill determine the applicable regulatory review period. Paragraph (a)(10)(i)is amended to recite that a Product License Application is a type of applicationthat may be recited in an application for term extension of a patent claiminga human biological product. New paragraphs (a)(10)(ii) and (a)(10)(iii)are added to set forth the type of tests or applications that are to beconsidered for determination of the applicable regulatory review periodfor patents claiming a new animal drug or a veterinary biological product.Present paragraphs (a)(10)(ii) and (a)(10)(iii) are redesignated as paragraphs(a)(10)(iv) and (a)(10)(v), respectively. Paragraph (a)(10)(v) has beenamended to reflect that approval of a medical device could be made throughthe use of a product development protocol. Paragraph (a)(13) is amendedto indicate that the duty to disclose any information material to the determinationof entitlement to the extension sought applies also to the Secretary ofAgriculture where the regulatory review was conducted by the USDA.Section 1.741(a)(2) is amended to acknowledge that regulatory review maytake place under more than one Federal statute and that each appropriatestatute should be listed. This amendment is intended to apply to a situationwhere a human biological product is tested under an investigational newdrug (IND) application pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct, but is approved under the Public Health Service Act. The amendmentis not intended to include a situation where approval is sought for useof a particular medical device with a specific drug product which may requireapproval under more than a single provision of law. The product that formsthe basis of an application for patent term extension must be either amedical device or a drug product; it cannot be a combination of those separateproducts. See the file history of U.S. Patent No. 4,428,744 for an exampleof the application of this principle.Section 1.741(a)(5) is amended to recognize that the Secretary of Agriculturemay determine the length of the regulatory review period where the regulatoryreview of the product takes place at the USDA. The section is further modifiedto point out that a determination of the length of the regulatory reviewperiod is made under 35 U.S.C. 156(g), and not the length of the patentterm extension that is made by the PTO under 35 U.S.C. 156(c).Section 1.765(a) is amended to recite that a duty of candor and good faithis owed to the Secretary of Agriculture in patent term extension proceedingswherein the USDA is involved.The title of andSection; 1.775 is amended to reflect that the section isdirected to calculating patent term extension for human drug, antibioticdrug, and human biological products. Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d)are amended to indicate that the determinations are being made for anyof a human drug, an antibiotic drug, or a human biological product. Sections(c)(1) and (c)(2) are amended to refer merely to a ``product'' rather thanto a ``human drug product'' or a ``drug product'' in order to make thesections clearer.Section 1.778 is added to set forth the manner of calculation of the patentterm extension for an animal drug product.Paragraph (a) specifies that the extension will run from the original expirationdate of the patent as shortened by any terminal disclaimer.Paragraph (b) of andSection; 1.778 provides that the patent term will beextended by the regulatory review period for the product but reduced, whereappropriate, by the time periods provided in paragraph (d).Paragraph (c) defines how the regulatory review period is to be calculated.The period is determined by counting:(1) The number of days in the period beginning on the earlier of the datesa major health or environmental effects test was initiated on the drugor an exemption under subsection (j) of section 512 of the Federal Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective for the drug and ending on thedate an application was initially submitted for the drug under section512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and(2) The number of days in the period beginning on the date the applicationwas initially submitted for the approved drug under subsection (b) of section512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and ending on the datethe application was approved under the section.The added total of the days determined in subparagraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2)constitutes the regulatory review period, which is then reduced, whereappropriate, by the time periods described in paragraph (d).Paragraph (d) of andSection; 1.778 modifies the term of the patent extensionby indicating that(1) The time period determined from paragraph (c) would be reduced, whereappropriate, by_(i) The number of days in the period of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) ofandSection; 1.778 that were before the date on which the patent issued;(ii) The number of days in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of andSection; 1.778during which it is determined under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(2)(B) that applicantdid not act with due diligence; and(iii) The number of days equal to one-half the number of days remainingin paragraph (c)(1) afer the paragraph (c)(1) determination has been reducedin accordance with paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of andSection; 1.778(half days to be ignored for subtraction purposes);(2) Adding the number of days determined in paragraph (d)(1) to the originalexpiration date of the patent as shortened by any terminal disclaimer;(3) Adding 14 years to the date of approval of the application under section512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;(4) Comparing the dates obtained from paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) witheach other and selecting the earlier date;(5) If the original patent issued after November 16, 1988, by_(i) Adding 5 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and(ii) Comparing the dates obtained from paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(i)with each other and selecting the earlier date;(6) If the original patent issued before November 16, 1988, and(i) If no major health or environmental effects test on the drug was initiatedand no request was submitted for an exemption under subsection (j) of section512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act before November 16, 1988,by_(A) Adding 5 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and(B) Comparing the dates obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(6)(i)(A)with each other and selecting the earlier date; or(ii) If a major health or environmental effects test was initiated or arequest for an exemption under subsection (j) of section 512 of the FederalFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was submitted before November 16, 1988, andthe application for commercial marketing or use of the drug was not approvedbefore November 16, 1988, by_(A) Adding 3 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and(B) Comparing the dates obtained from paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(6)(ii)(A)with each other and selecting the earlier date.Section 1.779 is added to set forth the manner of calculation of the patentterm extension for a veterinary biological product.Paragraph (a) specifies that the extension runs from the original expirationdate of the patent as shortened by any terminal disclaimer.Paragraph (b) of andSection; 1.779 provides that the patent term would beextended by the regulatory review period for the product but reduced, whereappropriate, by the time periods provided in paragraph (d).Paragraph (c) defines how the regulatory review period is to be calculated.The period is determined by counting(1) The number of days in the period beginning on the date the authorityto prepare an experimental biological product under the Virus-Serum-ToxinAct became effective and ending on the date an application for a licensewas submitted under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act; and(2) The number of days in the period beginning on the date an applicationfor a license wsa initially submitted under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act andending on the date a license was issued.The added total of the days determined in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2)constitutes the regulatory review period, which is then reduced, whereappropriate, by the time periods described in paragraph (d).Paragraph (d) of andSection; 1.779 defines the term of the patent extensionby indicating that:(1) The time period determined from paragraph (c) would be reduced, whereappropriate, by_(i) The number of days in the periods of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) thatwere on and before the date on which the patent issued;(ii) The number of days in the periods of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2)during which it is determined under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(2)(B) that the applicantdid not act with due diligence; and(iii) One-half the number of days remaining in the period defined by paragraph(c)(1) after that period is reduced in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1)(i)and (d)(1)(ii) (half days being ignored for purposes of subtraction);(2) Adding the number of days determined in paragraph (d)(1) to the originalterm of the patent as shortened by any terminal disclaimer;(3) Adding 14 years to the date of the issuance of a license under theVirus-Serum-Toxin Act;(4) Comparing the dates for the ends of the periods obtained pursuant toparagraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) and selecting the earlier date; (5) If the patent was issued after November 16, 1988, by_ (i) Adding 5 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and (ii) Comparing the dates obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5)(i)with each other and selecting the earlier date; (6) If the original patent issued before November 16, 1988, and (i) If no request for the authority to prepare an experimental biologicalproduct under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act was submitted before November 16,1988, by_ (A) Adding 5 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and (B) Comparing the dates obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(6)(i)(A)with each other and selecting the earlier date; or (ii) If a request for the authority to prepare an experimental biologicalproduct under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act was submitted before November 16,1988, and the commercial marketing or use of the product was not approvedbefore November 16, 1988, by_ (A) Adding 3 years to the original expiration date of the patent as shortenedby any terminal disclaimer; and (B) Comparing the dates obtained pursuant to paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(6)(ii)(A)and selecting the earlier date. Section 1.785(b) is amended to indicate that, in those instances wherean applicant is seeking patent term extension for two or more patents basedupon the same regulatory review period, the applicant will have the rightto elect which patent is to have its term extended. In the absence of theelection by applicant, the Commissioner will extend that patent havingthe earliest date of issuance. Other ConsiderationsThe rule change is in conformity with the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (Pub. L. No. 96-354), Executive Orders 12291 and 12612,and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theChief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration that the rulechange will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354).The rule change setting forth procedures allowing owners of patents directedto new animal drugs and veterinary biological products to apply for extensionof patent term would not be expected to result in any adverse economicimpact on small entities because patented drugs are generally not commercializedby small entities. The PTO has determined that this rule change is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291. The annual effect to the economy will be less than$100 million. There will be no major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, state, or local government agencies, orgeographic regions. There will be no significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.The PTO has also determined that this notice has no federalism implicationsaffecting the relationship between the National Government and the Statesas outlined in Executive Order 12612. The rule change contains a collection of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>. which has been approved by the Office of Management andBudget under control number 0651-0020. Preparation of an application forpatent term extension is estimated to take approximately sixty hours, includingtime for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden to the Officeof Management and Organization, Patent and Trademark Office, Washington,DC 20231, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Officeof Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. (Paperwork Reduction Project0651-0030) No comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspectof this collection of information were received in response to the noticeof proposed rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 37 CFR Part 1</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Authority delegations (Governmentagencies), Conflict of interest, Courts, Inventions and patents, Lawyers.For the reasons given in the preamble and pursuant to the authority grantedto the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks by 35 U.S.C. 6 and 156, thePTO is amending Part 1 of Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations asset forth below. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart F_Extension of Patent Term</ITAG>1.
