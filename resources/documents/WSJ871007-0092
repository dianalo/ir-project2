He didn't have to look long for a buyer.    Masao Nangaku, a billionaire Japanese real estate developer who recently bought the Dunes Hotel andamp; Country Club in Las Vegas, quickly snapped up stately Schloss Gymnich for 28 million marks ($15 million). He plans to turn the 800-year-old moated castle, where the government used to put up the likes of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, into a luxury hotel.    &quot;Is nothing sacred to the Japanese?&quot; carped a German magazine. And the news service DPA declared: &quot;Gymnich's glorious heritage is now a thing of the past.&quot;    It is a refrain heard more and more in West Germany. &quot;This is the tip of the iceberg of a Japanese invasion,&quot; says Willy Koenen, the Duesseldorf real estate agent who brokered the Gymnich sale. Buying up real estate and investing in manufacturing plants, the Japanese have boosted their annual private direct investment in Germany more than fivefold since 1983, to 1.3 billion marks ($705.9 million) last year.    To be sure, Japan still makes the largest chunk of its overseas investment in the U.S., and its biggest presence in Europe is in Britain. But investment here is catching up, reflecting Germany's reliable work force, stable labor relations, good subcontractors and strategic distribution location.    Germany is particularly ambivalent about how to respond. Germans have always admired Japan. They welcome jobs produced by Japanese investment and, because their own economy is export-driven, traditionally advocate free trade. But the Germans take immense pride in their own status as an industrial powerhouse and fear any erosion; Germans think their products are better.    Japan's rising activity in Europe partially reflects the increasingly wary reception its traders are receiving in the U.S., the destination of 40% of Japanese exports. And, as Japan seeks to sell more in Europe, it is increasing direct investment as a way of avoiding trade restrictions. Some Japanese auto makers now ship cars to Europe from their U.S. plants to avoid European barriers on imports from Japan.    Japan's business expansion in Germany is already beginning to strain the German side of the mutual admiration society. Germany has filed a number of dumping complaints against Japan with the European Community, and there are rumblings of protectionist sentiment. In particular, the German auto industry -- a source of intense national pride -- is increasingly alarmed at inroads by Japanese imports. German sales of Japanese cars soared 135% between 1982 and 1986, accounting for 15% of the market last year.    Unless something is done, warns Carl Hahn, chairman of Volkswagen AG, Japan's market share &quot;could grow too quickly.&quot; He urges short-term EC regulation of Japanese auto imports. Britain, France and Italy already sharply limit Japanese car imports.    At the same time, German auto makers are moving to collaborate with the Japanese. In June, VW agreed to joint production in Germany of Toyota Motor Corp.-designed pickup trucks beginning in 1989. Daimler-Benz AG, meanwhile, is negotiating with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. to coproduce and distribute commercial vehicles in Europe. VW and Daimler hope the links will help them in the Japanese market. Officially, Germany is still determined to extend the welcome mat to the Japanese. &quot;We are liberal and expansive,&quot; says Siegfried Boettcher, an Asia expert at the Economics Ministry. &quot;After all, one-third of our production goes abroad.&quot;    German state governments in particular covet the injection of Japanese capital and jobs. About 10,000 Germans work for Japanese employers. They range from branch operations of such consumer-electronics makers as Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Ltd. to small producers of such products as eyeglass frames, disposable cigarette lighters, gears and measuring instruments.    The highly industrialized state of North Rhineland-Westphalia is a prime beneficiary. Of the about 650 Japanese companies operating in West Germany, about 400 have their headquarters there. Even the depressed Ruhr Valley, beset with steel- and coal-industry layoffs, has profited. Since the 1950s, when the Ruhr Valley was booming, the Japanese have made Duesseldorf a focal point for their operations in Germany. Today, about 18,000 Japanese live in Germany, most of them around Duesseldorf, and 4,500 of them are businessmen. By comparison, only 3,000 Germans live in Japan, 450 of whom are businessmen.    There are frictions. German companies are troubled by the incentives being offered by regional governments to lure Japanese companies. These include low-cost factory sites, subsidies totaling as much as 40% of the amount invested and generous housing arrangements for executives' families. The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg is so eager to attract Japanese investment that it is setting up an industrial park for Japanese high-technology concerns that will offer such services as a Japanese restaurant and a Japanese school.    &quot;There should be no special subsidies,&quot; argues Bernhard Welschke, head of the Asia department of the Association for German Industry, who notes that Japanese companies may get subsidies that their German competitors don't. Moreover, Mr. Welschke charges, the Japanese decimate West German markets by selling cheaply to gain market share. &quot;In 1969, the Japanese were destroying the German market for cutlery,&quot; he says. &quot;In 1972, they started to destroy the German market for cameras, and in 1975 it was photocopiers.&quot;    &quot;As soon as the Japanese have the market rolled up, then the prices are raised and profits come back,&quot; he says.    German businessmen also complain that Japan's trade success is increasingly one-sided. While Germany absorbs 4.5% of Japan's exports, Japan purchases just 1.7% of Germany's exports. Germany ran a trade deficit with Japan last year of 15 billion marks, one-third of Europe's deficit with Japan.    Moreover, many, but not all, German companies attempting to do business in Japan have had rough going. Acknowledging this, Japan's ambassador to West Germany warns expectant German exporters: &quot;The gate is open, but perhaps inside it's like a labyrinth.&quot;    There are exceptions. In 1986, almost a quarter of all automobiles imported by Japan were Bayerische Motoren Werke's BMWs. Using its own distribution system in Japan, BMW sales there rose 27% in the first six months from the year-earlier period. Volkswagen and Daimler-Benz also boast rising sales in Japan.
