Officials in Beirut denied reports that the hijackersfound haven in Beirut.   The 24 passengers and seven crew members from the Kuwait AirwaysBoeing 747 that was seized April 5 left Algiers airport at 3:20p.m. (12:20 p.m. EDT). They were freed Wednesday.   KUNA, Kuwait's official news agency, said an official and publicreception was planned for tonight. Most of the former hostages areKuwaiti.   The hijackers had demanded that Kuwait free 17 imprisonedterrorists, which Kuwait rejected. But there were reports thatKuwait agreed to commute the death sentences of three of theprisoners.   Before the hostages left aboard a Kuwait Airways Boeing 767,Kuwaiti official Ahmad Fahd said all were found fit to travel aftermedical examinations at the military hospital in Algiers. Fahd wassent here to oversee the crisis.   The nine hijackers, who had killed two Kuwaiti hostages, werebelieved to have left Algeria after slipping out of the plane aheadof the hostages at dawn Wednesday.   KUNA, citing unidentified Algerian sources, said Algerianmediators promised the hijackers safe passage to travel to Beirutor Tehran.   Western diplomats in Algiers, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said they believed the hijackers went to Beirut.   CBS, without naming sources, said today that the hijackers hadarrived in Beirut. But Beirut airport officials, also speakingprivately, told The Associated Press that the hijackers had notarrived.   The plane was seized April 5 on a Bangkok-to-Kuwait flight with112 aboard and diverted to Mashhad, Iran, where the terroristsreleased 57 hostages.   Freed passengers said they believed more gunmen boarded atMashhad with submachine guns and dynamite, which was later wired tothe plane's doors.   After three days in Mashhad, the plan flew to Larnaca, Cyprus.During five days there, the hijackers beat two Kuwaiti securitymen, shot them to death and dumped their bodies from the aircraft.The hijackers let 13 more hostages go in exchange for fuel thatbrought them to Algiers.   Several days before giving up, the hijackers freed an ailingpassenger.   Throughout the ordeal, the hijackers demanded that the PersianGulf sheikdom free 17 pro-Iranian extremists imprisoned for the1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies there.   Kuwait steadfastly refused, and its rulers were lauded by theirpeople on Wednesday for standing firm. But there was some angerexpressed in Kuwait because the hijackers had been allowed to gofree.   The deal also provoked criticism from the United States, Britainand the International Air Transport Association, a Montreal-basedtrade association that represents 170 international airlines.   ``They are not only hijackers but murderers,'' Secretary ofState George P. Shultz said in Finland on Wednesday while en routeto Moscow for pre-summit talks.   Western intelligence officials have said they believe two of thehijackers were Lebanese nationals under U.S. indictment for the1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner in which a U.S. Navy diver wasslain.   Rodney Wallis, security director of the International AirTransport Association, told The Associated Press: ``We can assumewe have not heard the last'' of the hijackers. ``We now have thepossibility that a number of trained hijackers could lead missionsof their own.''   Neither Algeria nor Kuwait would disclose terms of the deal.However, NBC News reported that unidentified U.S. officialsbelieved the Algerians provided the hijackers with letters or tapesfrom the 17 prisoners in Kuwait so friends and relatives could seethe prisoners had not been harmed.   A U.S. official in Washington said efforts were made to assurethe hijackers the 17 were not mistreated. But the official,speaking on condition of anonymity, did not confirm the thehijackers were given letters or tapes.   KUNA said the hijackers left the plane in two shifts 10 minutesapart on Wednesday. The hostages staggered down the gangway 20minutes later. Among them were three cousins of the Kuwaiti ruler,Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.   An Algerian air force transport plane force took off shortlythereafter. It is rare for military aircraft to use the civilianHouari Boumedienne airport, and there was speculation hijackerswere aboard.   Algerian officials would not discuss the flight or its occupants.   Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, who led the Algerian mediators,announced the drama's end without giving details and said the fateof the hijackers was the ``concern of Algeria'' alone.   KUNA said the crisis ended ``without any deal'' concerning the17 imprisoned pro-Iranian extremists, but there were reports Kuwaitagreed to commute the death sentences that had been given to threeof the 17 prisoners.   A Kuwaiti official in Algiers, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said he believed an understanding may have been reachedthat would commute the sentences to life in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
