Bennett, a research staff member at the IBM T.J.andP;  WatsonResearch Centre in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., and his collaborate, Prof.andP;  GillesBrassard of the University of Montreal, demonstrated their secret signalmachine, called a &quot;quantum public key distribution device,&quot; at the EurocrytConference meeting.andP;  (For an article explaining the use of crytography incomputer security, see Computing Canada, May 24, 1990, p. 1).andM;The scientists said it is the first communications system ever built to use afundamental physical law, the &quot;uncertainty principal,&quot; to protect the secrecyof messages.andM;Bennett and his collaborators work with very faint flashes of green light,generated by an ordinary diode of the type commonly used as a power-onindicator in electronic appliances.andP;  Each flash is so dim that it is unlikelyto contain more than one photon, the least-detectable unit of light energy,and is far too faint to be seen.andM;The uncertainty principle says that such a faint light flash cannot bemeasured without disturbing its properties.andP;  Two such properties are&quot;rectilinear polarization&quot; (whether the electric field associated with thelight is oscillating vertically or horizontally) and &quot;circular polarization&quot;(whether the electric field is rotating to the left or to the right relativeto the direction of propagation).andM;Either one of these properties can be measured on a light flash as dim as asingle photon, but doing so makes the value of the other property random.andM;Bennett built the apparatus with the help of IBM summer student John Smolin,now at UCLA.andP;  For Bennett, whose research has been in theoretical fieldssince he came to IBM in 1973, the project was, he said, &quot;a great deal offun.&quot;andM;Although the present version of the apparatus operates a distance of only 13inches, the range could be extended to several miles or more once moretransparent optical fibers become available.andP;  At that time, the device couldbecome a practical means of secure communications.andP;  Bennett will build a newversion of the device that uses an optical fiber and will operate over adistance of several hundred meters.andM;Meanwhile, Bennett said, the device demonstrates the complexity of therelationship between information and the signals used to transmit it.andP;  &quot;Suchdistinctively quantum phenomena are quite scarce,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
