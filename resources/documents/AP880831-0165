AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Miguel de la Madrid believes hisbiggest accomplishment is maintaining social order while keepingthe country from going bankrupt, an aide said.   De la Madrid, who planned to deliver his final state of thenation message on Thursday, came to power on Dec. 1, 1982. Mexicowas nearly bankrupt after a collapse in oil prices, inflation wasrampant and the value of the peso was plunging.   While he is proud of keeping Mexico solvent and relatively freeof unrest, ``his frustration was not being able to do the things hewould have liked because of the economic limitations,'' said theaide, who spoke on condition of anonymity Tuesday.   But de la Madrid's efforts to reform a corrupt political systemproduced Mexico's most democratic election since his InstitutionalRevolutionary Party gained power in 1929.   One hundred seats to be divided in proportion to the nationalvote were added to the lower house of the legislature, giving theopposition an opportunity to win a larger role. Oppositioncandidates were permitted to win local elections, especially in thenorth.   The PRI itself instituted primaries on the municipal level,although a disagreement about presidential primaries was one factorin a split that helped the left-wing opposition, which groupeditself as the Democratic Front.   The result was a July 6 presidential election that saw theopposition win nearly 50 per cent of the popular vote and aforceful voice in Congress. But the opposition contended the PRImaintained its grip on power only through massive fraud.   A long wrangle in the Chamber of Deputies ended with the PRItaking 260 seats and a divided opposition 240 _ 139 for the leftistFront and 101 for the rightist National Action Party. The left alsowon four of 64 seats in the Senate, the first time the PRI has everlost Senate seats.   De la Madrid, a Harvard-trained economist, renegotiated aforeign debt that now stands at $104 billion while resistingpressure for a moratorium on payments. His administration tooksteps to reduce the role of the state in the economy, although manylarge industries, such as petroleum and banking, remainnationalized.   Some of the steps were painful, and the peso plunge cost Mexicanconsumers about 50 percent of their buying power during de laMadrid's six-year term.   He also had to deal with the September 1985 earthquake in MexicoCity, which killed about 9,500 people.   De la Madrid downplayed Mexico's high profile role in CentralAmerica, avoiding open friction with the United States overconflicts in Nicaragua and El Salvador while working for regionalsolutions.   He had a good working relationship with President Reagan andargued that Mexico could not be solely responsible for stoppingdrug trafficking. De la Madrid said the drug problem starts at theconsumer level in the United States.   De la Madrid prepared the way economically for his chosensuccessor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who was largely responsiblefor the regime's economic measures as de la Madrid's Planning andBudget secretary.   In addition to loosening tight state control of the economy, dela Madrid brought Mexico into the General Agreement in Trade andTariffs to force Mexican industralists to compete abroad anddomestically.   When inflation hit nearly 150 percent in 1987, de la Madridunited government and private business in a belt-tighteningeconomic solidarity pact that helped reduce inflation to 43 percent in the first six months of 1988. Government figures for Augustshow a rate of below 1 percent.   De la Madrid suffered harsh criticism from both left and right.Leftist presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas called for amoratorium on debt payments, saying that they are hobbling economicdevelopment. The National Action Party wants economic privatizationto go farther, faster.   The political reforms changed the political structure of thiscountry and shook the PRI. Salinas, who won with the lowestpercentage ever for a PRI presidential candidate, said after theelection that ``the era of the one-party rule is over.''   Referring to the drop in popular support, de la Madrid told agroup of labor leaders Tuesday that the party made mistakes.   But he added, ``There is no threat to the system. We willregroup, will will fight more strongly. We are strongly enough tokeep reactionaries from the left or the right to take power awayfrom the Mexican Revolution.''</TEXT></DOC>
