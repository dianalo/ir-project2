The justices, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments thatuse of the racketeering law violated the protesters' free-speechrights.   The protesters were sued successfully by operators of theabortion clinic.   Similar lawsuits, each invoking the federal RacketeeringInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), have been filedagainst anti-abortion activists in cities such as Pittsburgh,Chicago and Brookline, Mass.   Antonio Califa, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer inWashington, recently wrote: ``The ACLU believes that civil RICO'spotential for chilling First Amendment rights of expression isenormous.''   The concern centers on the possibility political protesters willbe labeled ``racketeers'' and held financially liable for doingnothing more than expressing their views.   But in upholding a $108,000 award against the 26 Philadelphiaprotesters last March, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals saidtheir actions ``went beyond ... constitutional rights of speech andprotest.''   The protesters on four occasions from 1984 to 1986 unlawfullyentered the Northeast Women's Center in Philadelphia. According totrial testimony, protesters threw medical supplies on the floor,damaged equipment, assaulted the clinic's employees and harassedpatients.   ``An assistant district attorney who witnessed a demonstrationtestified that the demonstrators' activity rose to a `frenzy' andthat he delayed leaving the center out of fear for his phsyicalsafety,'' the appeals court noted.   It added: ``Civil RICO could appropriately be applied todefendants' intimidation and harassment of the center resulting inthe destruction of its property.''   Michael McMonagle, executive director of Pro-Life Coalition ofSoutheast Pennsylvania, said ``this is one battle in a long war. Weintend to continue our efforts to non-violently save children andmothers from abortion at the abortion facilities. This case willnot deter that one bit.''   The 26 protesters are members of the coalition.   Edmond A. Tiryak, attorney for Northeast Women's Center, said``this decision shows that our society will not tolerate the use offear and intimidation by religious fanatics to impose their will onwomen seeking abortion services.''   In other action, the court:   _ Agreed to decide whether a Texas man who murdered a deputysheriff 10 years ago may raise the issue of his mental retardationin a new attack on his death sentence.   The court's decision, expected sometime in 1990, could clarifythe scope _ and retroactive effects _ of its decision last June 26that allowed states to execute mentally retarded killers but nly ifjurors were allowed to take a defendant's mental condition intoconsideration.   _ Agreed to use the case of a convicted California robber todispel some uncertainty over when items seized in a police searchmay be used against criminal suspects.   The court said it will hear an appeal by Terry Brice Horton,sentenced to 8 years and 8 months in prison for robbery, illegalfirearms possession and other charges.   _ Overturned a fine against a Pennsylvania newspaper forpublishing conversations of a bookmaker whose customer's telephonewas tapped by police.   The justices ordered a state court to reconsider a $1,000 fineand $17,409 in lawyers' fees imposed against The Easton Express.The newspaper carried a story based on wiretap transcriptsaccidentally placed in public court records.   The high court said the case should be restudied in light of thejustices' ruling last June that spared a Florida newspaper fromhaving to pay damages to a rape victim whose name it published.   _ Agreed to resolve a dispute in the federal prosecution of ninePuerto Rico men accused of robbing $7.2 million from a Wells Fargodepot in Connecticut six years ago.   The justices said they will decide whether all the taperecordings made during court-authorized electronic surveillance ofthe defendants may be used as trial evidence.   A federal appeals court ruled that some of the tapes may not beused as evidence because they were not sealed for safekeepingquickly enough.   In the abortion-protest appeal acted on today, lawyers for the26 protesters decried ``an unprecedented and dangerous expansionof'' the federal law primarily aimed at fighting organized crime.   ``Under the 3rd Circuit's interpretations of RICO ... MartinLuther King was a racketeer when he trespassed on private propertyand conspired with others in an attempt to change the businesspolicies of owners of segregated lunch counters,'' the appealcontended.   ``So, too, is anyone participating in a sit-in against apartheidwith the goal of changing the investment policies of auniversity,'' the appeal said, arguing that no RICO violationshould be found if no economic profit motive exists.   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case sothe court could consider whether a profit-making element is neededfor RICO prosecutions. Four such votes are needed to grant review.   Lawyers for the clinic urged the justices to reject the appeal,and accused the 26 protesters of deceptively trying to portraytheir demonstrations as peaceful.   ``Those individuals who engaged in peaceful and protectedactivities are not and were never parties to this case. The (26)are those who exceeded the bounds of protected activity and engagedin violent and unlawful activities,'' the clinic's lawyers said.   The case is McMonagle vs. Northeast Women's Center, 88-2137.  </TEXT></DOC>
