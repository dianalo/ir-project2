While mourning the 87-year-old emperor, they were relieved to seean end to the six turbulent decades of Hirohito's Showa era and thesmooth transition to Heisei, or ``achieving peace,'' the name givenEmperor Akihito's reign.   Some stores turned off advertising signs for two days afterHirohito died Jan. 7, but Japan had been prepared by his longillness and it was business as usual for most people, a turningpoint rather than a traumatic loss.   Until Hirohito renounced his divinity after World War II,emperors were regarded as living gods. Polls in recent yearsindicated a small minority of Japanese still considered him one.   Akihito is seen as an ordinary person, which some welcome andothers regret.   ``Hirohito represented the darker side of Japanese history,''said Gregory Clark, professor of Japanese studies at SophiaUniversity in Tokyo.   ``With the appearance of a new emperor, there's a fresh startgoing on. You can see it particularly in the stock market, and Ithink it will spread to other areas.''   In the first three trading days after the emperor died, the mainindex of the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained 933.91 points, or 3.1percent.   ``He wasn't a god, but he was somehow different from ordinarypeople,'' said Hiroko Gotoh, 22. ``I don't think I've changed insidebecause of his death, but I have a feeling an era has changed inJapan.''   Fears were expressed that rightists would use Hirohito's death toincrease imperial power. Akihito quickly indicated, however, that hewould be closer to the people and perhaps let more light through the``chrysanthemum curtain'' surrounding the imperial family, whichuses the flower as its symbol.   In his first public statement, the new emperor wore a plainWestern morning suit and spoke in straightforward language insteadof the classic Chinese-style ``chokugo'' his father used on the sameoccasion in 1926. The speech and some other transition rites,private in the past, were televised.   Akihito, 55, said he would try to ``constantly be at one with thepeople'' and would join with them ``to preserve the constitution ofJapan.''   That was widely interpreted as a message to those in thegoverning Liberal Democratic Party and elsewhere who have called forchange in the document imposed by the United States after theJapanese surrender, which renounces war and gives the emperor noreal political power.   ``It was quite significant that he said he would protect theconstitution,'' Clark said. ``Normally a Japanese monarch would nottake such a political position.''   As the first emperor who never was considered divine, Akihitowill have an opportunity to shape the imperial institution's futureand define its place in society.   Cabinet decisions on the transition raised questions about thegovernment's attitude toward the imperial system, which pastofficials used to foster a sense of Japanese racial and culturaluniqueness and to rally support for the invasion of much of Asia.   Opposition parties criticized the government decision to sponsorportions of Hirohito's funeral, scheduled Feb. 24, and two othertransition rites linked to the Shinto religion. They saidsponsorship might violate constitutional separation of religion andstate.   Several families who protested government-mandated schoolmemorials to Hirohito by keeping their children home reportedreceiving death threats.   The Shinto origin of the rites illustrates the close ties betweenthe former state religion, based in nature, and the emperor, who isdeclared by myth to be a direct descendant of the sun goddess.   Polls indicate most Japanese support the current imperial system,which defines the emperor as the ``symbol of the state and the unityof the people,'' but not head of state.   People who want to restore imperial divinity and increase themonarch's role as spiritual leader find themselves with a newemperor who ``will never become a living god because he is toohuman,'' said Kenichiro Sembon, senior editor of Asahi Journal, aleading liberal news weekly.   ``Why should such an ordinary person become an emperor?'' hesaid. ``Now is a good time for us to start thinking about that, andabout all aspects of the imperial system, including whether we needthe system at all.''   Clark commented: ``I wonder whether the ultra-nationalists willbe able to maintain their interest in a pacifist emperor.''   Groups on both the left and right identify the imperial systemwith militarism and nationalism.   ``What I fear is that an emperor without Hirohito's popularitymight cause the imperial system to become more remote from thepeople, and rightists might use force to try to bring the systemback into prominence,'' a senior politician of the governing partysaid privately.   Akihito's conduct before becoming emperor already has inched openthe doors of the secretive Imperial Household Agency, which overseesroyal affairs.   His father was tutored by war heroes chosen by courtchamberlains. Akihito studied with ordinary students and was tutoredby American pacifist Elizabeth Gray Vining, who is said to havegiven him a sense of the equality of all people.   He is the first Japanese monarch to select his own wife, andchose a commoner with a Western-style education. Akihito and EmpressMichiko raised their three children themselves, ending the imperialpractice of separating children from parents.   News accounts said Akihito and Michiko frequently have been atodds with the Imperial Household Agency.   ``Reforming the Imperial Household Agency is the most seriousproblem facing the new emperor,'' said Takeshi Maezawa, ombudsman ofthe conservative Yomiuri, Japan's largest newspaper. ``Japan won'tbe able to move fully into the 21st century under the agency'scurrent situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
