Glenda Brawley probably will not be arrested as long as sheremains in the Queens church, state Attorney General Robert Abramssaid Wednesday.   ``That decision is in the hands of the sheriff,'' said Abrams,the special prosecutor in the investigation.   ``But I think he and I agree that if we charge that churchtoday, that would be precisely what the advisers for the Brawleyfamily would want in terms of their agenda and another chapter ofthe media circus they have performed.''   Mrs. Brawley, 33, spent Wednesday in the Ebenezer BaptistChurch, where more than 400 supporters gathered in the evening fora prayer service, giving her a standing ovation.   ``We will never back down! We will never give up! We will neverbuckle under! We will never apologize!'' the Rev. Al Sharpton, oneof Mrs. Brawley's advisers, told the gathering.   In Poughkeepsie, where a grand jury investigating the case metagain Wednesday, Abrams said: ``If Glenda Brawley chooses to exileherself, confine herself, jail herself, in a particular church, andshe wants to do it for a day, 10 days, 30 days, that's her choosing.   ``It's only going to be added to, and on top of, a 30-dayeventual jail sentence she will have to serve for her violation ofthe court's order.''   Dutchess County Sheriff Fred Scoralick refused to say whataction, if any, was being taken. On Tuesday, the department issueda statewide arrest warrant for Mrs. Brawley.   Sharpton said, ``We're going to stay here until the warrant iskilled.''   Tawana Brawley, 16, disappeared for four days in November andwas found wrapped in a plastic bag about 10 miles from herWappingers Falls home.   Some of her hair had been chopped off, animal excrement wassmeared and racial epithets were scrawled on her body.   In sketchy interviews with authorities, she said she had beenabducted and sexually abused by six white men, one of whom had apolice-style badge. A hospital found no evidence of rape.   Her mother was sentenced Monday to 30 days in jail for defying agrand jury subpoena, but she had been given until Wednesday tocooperate. Mrs. Brawley made no statements Wednesday.   Sharpton and lawyers Alton Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon Mason sayMiss Brawley and her mother won't cooperate with the grand jury,which they claim is biased against blacks.   They have accused authorities of conspiring in a cover-up andare demanding a new special prosecutor.   ``We've got the facts and the evidence,'' Sharpton said duringthe prayer service, addressing Abrams and Gov. Mario Cuomo. ``Allyou've got to do is call our bluff and give us an impartialprosecutor. Give us a prosecutor and tell us to put up or shut up.''   Cuomo on Wednesday supported Abrams' handling of the case.Referring to the Brawley advisers, he said: ``They say in effect noblack person gets justice in this state, and therefore they willnot participate.   ``If they were to be utterly logical, then no black personshould ever pay a parking ticket, no black person should ever paytheir income taxes nor serve on a jury nor in any way participatein this society. And that's an absurdity. I think most of thisstate and most of the country recognize it for what it is.''   The attorney general has said that if there is no cooperationfrom the family the grand jury would likely wind up itsinvestigation in about a month.</TEXT></DOC>
