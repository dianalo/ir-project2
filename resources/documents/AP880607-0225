But, considering the state of the industry, if savingsinstitutions are not able to supply the money needed by theinsurance fund, ``there's only one other source, and that'sultimately the taxpayer,'' he said.   Wolf said some 500 savings and loans across the country areinsolvent, and 20 of them are ``what we would classify as hopelesslyinsolvent.''   Two institutions closed Monday are neither the best nor the worstin the country, and there are a number of other large ones that willwind up costing about the same when they fail, he said.   The record $1.35 billion payment to depositors in two failedCalifornia savings institutions is likely to renew debate over howlong the fund that insures thrifts can last without congressionalaction.   So far, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has gottenby without taxpayer money. Congress last August provided for aninfusion of $10.8 billion over three years, to be raised by sale ofbonds paid off by the industry. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board,the agency in charge of thrift institutions, has used $2.9 billionof that borrowing authority.   The FSLIC, which guarantees deposits up to $100,000, is paying$1.14 billion to American Diversified Savings Bank and $209 millionto North America Savings and Loan Association. Both are located inCosta Mesa, Calif.   The American Diversified transaction is FSLIC's largest cashpayout in the agency's 54-year history, according to the top federalSandamp;L regulator, M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan BankBoard.   The agency has spent more on assistance transactions, including$2 billion a month ago to help Southwest Savings Association inDallas acquire four insolvent Sandamp;Ls, and $1.3 billion in November tobail out Vernon Savings and Loan Association, also of Dallas.   But in those cases most of the help came in the form of notes,promising payment if needed, and guarantees against certain futurelosses.   The two California transactions drop the insurance fund cashbalance from $3.2 billion to $1.9 billion. However, another $465million in revenue is due this month from insurance premiums paid byhealthy Sandamp;Ls.   All told, including insurance premium payments by Sandamp;Ls, the fundshould have about $20 billion to work with over three years andabout $30 billion over 10 years.   However, the GAO says that may not be enough. About 500 of thenation's 3,120 federally insured Sandamp;Ls are considered insolvent andthe GAO says it will cost $26 billion to $36 billion to clean up themess.   Private analysts put the price tag even higher _ at about $50billion.   Problems ahead for the thrift industry include Texas, where 143of 281 thrifts are ailing. Sunbelt Savings Association in Dallasalone recorded a $1.2 billion loss in the first quarter of this year.   In California, the rescue of the second largest Sandamp;L holdingcompany in the nation, Financial Corp. of America in Irvine, isstill pending. The Robert M. Bass Group of Fort Worth, Texas, isnegotiating with the bank board over a takeover. Estimates of thecost of that bail out run into the billions.   Wall says the bank board has all it can responsibly spend through1990. But should more money be required, there are basically threesources where Congress will look.   The first is the industry. George Gould, undersecretary of theTreasury, estimates the industry could finance something less than$15 billion. That's vigorously opposed by Sandamp;L lobby groups.   The second is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which has $18billion to insure deposits in 13,650 commercial banks. Commercialbanks and their regulators are already moving to try to head thatoff.   The third source would be tax funds, not an easy proposition toget by Congress in an age of budget limits.</TEXT></DOC>
