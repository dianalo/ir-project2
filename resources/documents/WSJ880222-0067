Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FRB </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In the midst of negotiations for a combination with crosstown rival RepublicBank Corp. about 15 months ago, a team of InterFirst Corp. executives pored over Republic's books.    What they saw shocked them. Everybody knew that InterFirst was in trouble, but Republic's public statements hadn't hinted of any similar problems. After they saw Republic's loan portfolio, however, &quot;it was hard to say which bank was worse,&quot; says a high-level former InterFirst executive involved in the examination.    Nevertheless, both sides agreed that a union provided the best chance for them to survive the Texas banking crisis. An intrastate merger, all the rage in banking circles because of the potential for sharp reductions in operating costs, was just the ticket for their ailing institutions, they reasoned.    Thus was forged First RepublicBank Corp., the Lone Star state's largest banking concern and the nation's 13th largest. Now, amid rumors about an imminent takeover -- which the bank denies -- and federal regulators preparing a possible rescue, that bold merger strategy is in deep trouble. Considerable cost savings have been achieved. But in view of Texas's severely depressed economy, it is questionable whether that will be enough for the two institutions, which reminded one bank analyst of &quot;two drunks trying to hold each other up.&quot;    First RepublicBank's latest troubles hit recently, as a team of 65 federal bank examiners began reviewing the institution's financial condition. The audit was scheduled sometime ago. But the timing couldn't have been worse, coming as word also leaked out that First RepublicBank's certificates of deposit had got the lowest rating possible from a closely watched bankrating service. That service is provided to customers of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods, a New York investment banking firm specializing in bank stocks.    Last week ended with withdrawals accelerating; First Republic's banks have lost a total of $1.14 billion in average deposits since December. The company's stock sank to a record low of $1.50 a share in heavy composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading of its debt slumped in secondary markets. And regulators have been &quot;running fire drills&quot; in case a bailout is needed, according to a top official at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    A federal rescue of First Republic could require as much as $4.5 billion, equaling the record bank bailout of Chicago's Continental Illinois Corp. in 1984.    No one is saying that First RepublicBank -- which isn't related to San Francisco's First Republic Bancorp -- has reached that point. In an interview, the company's top executives outline an aggressive strategy to raise capital and earnings power by shoring up troubled real-estate loans and paring some $2 billion in problem loans from its portfolio. But some banking experts think that a bailout may be inevitable if the weak Texas economy doesn't stabilize this year and losses reach the $450 million level privately projected by the banking concern.    Meanwhile, the bank's crisis-management team, part of which met over the weekend, has retained outside consultants. Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., First Republic's New York investment banker, is apparently advising the company and helping it search for capital.    Throughout the difficult week, Gerald W. Fronterhouse, First Republic's embattled chairman and chief executive, insisted that the bank would endure. &quot;Gosh darn, I don't know how many times I have got to say this: We have no plans to merge with any institution,&quot; the 51-year-old former petroleum engineer said wearily in a telephone interview yesterday. &quot;We are confident that we will be successful.&quot;    Hardly anyone could have expected any of this a few years ago, when Texas banks were blossoming as regional giants, talking of making Dallas and Houston major money centers and investing brashly in one Texas-sized real-estate project after another. &quot;It's a sad and unbelievable transformation,&quot; says James J. McDermott Jr., a top Keefe Bruyette analyst, who wistfully recalls crisscrossing the state in the heady days of the early 1980s to study banks basking in strong profits from the Sun Belt boom. &quot;These guys were on top of the hill, and now they are being buried by the hill.&quot;    The slide in the state's banks began slowly when the price of oil plunged from a high of nearly $40 a barrel and slipped briefly below $10 a barrel in 1986 -- and swept the Texas economy down with it. Many of those ambitious commercial real-estate developments, bankrolled largely by Texas banks and thrift institutions, began to unravel in a seriously overbuilt market. Almost overnight, Texas banks were transformed from lenders and investors to foreclosers and liquidators.    As the depth of the real-estate lending crisis dawned on bank officials and regulators, loan-loss reserves soared, profits vanished and capital bases eroded. One by one, big Texas banks fell. Last May, Chemical New York Corp. acquired Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. In June, Republic picked up InterFirst. In January, First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles completed its purchase of Allied Bancshares Inc. When no buyer stepped forward for Houston's troubled First City Bancorp. of Texas Inc., the FDIC assisted Chicago banker A. Robert Abboud in a $1.5 billion bailout that is expected to be completed soon.    In addition, federal thrift regulators are orchestrating a complex $6 billion to $7 billion rescue effort that encompasses as much as a third of the state's savings and loan institutions.    But First RepublicBank was going to be different. Despite the growing problems in Texas banking, it intended to emerge as the region's dominant bank. To do so, it bought troubled InterFirst in a $544 million stock swap. At the time, InterFirst was saddled with $1.2 billion in bad loans, 7.4% of its $16.7 billion in assets. That barely fazed its crosstown suitor. &quot;Shoot, we can handle that,&quot; a cocky Mr. Fronterhouse, RepublicBank's chairman, said at the time.    However, other major banking companies wouldn't touch InterFirst without FDIC assistance. When Security Pacific Corp., a big bank holding company based in Los Angeles, was considering making an offer, it privately proposed -- apparently unbeknown to InterFirst -- an FDIC guarantee on the Dallas bank's bad loans that could have tapped the insurance fund for up to $2 billion. &quot;The FDIC was willing to give financial help, and Republic waltzes in and takes InterFirst without anything,&quot; a source close to those negotiations says. &quot;I was dumbfounded.&quot;    Republic wasn't exactly the Rock of Gibraltar, either. When InterFirst's board met in December 1986 to vote on the RepublicBank takeover, a director confides, Robert H. Stewart III, InterFirst's chairman and chief executive, recommended the deal, largely because of his concern about surviving alone in Texas's depressed economy. But he also said that Republic's loan portfolio wasn't in as good a shape as its public reports had led outsiders to believe.    The two troubled institutions were counting on the benefits of an intrastate banking merger, which has become a hot new strategy. By combining with a neighbor rather than some distant operation, bankers hope to gain economies of scale and greater market share in a specific region. Most of all, they figure that as much as 25% can be squeezed out of operating costs by eliminating duplicate services.    Furthermore, RepublicBank's takeover of InterFirst in a stock transaction was well below book value, enabling the combined company to write off some bad InterFirst loans and thus preserve capital without damaging profits.    But the hardscrabble Texas economy soon wilted such hopes. The cost savings ran $140 million a year but were more than wiped out by losses from soured real-estate deals. Last fall, First RepublicBank updated its property appraisals; the loan-review committee was stunned by the deterioration in property values. In the second half of 1987, an added $1.5 billion in loans had turned bad. That led to record losses, of $347.8 million in the fourth quarter and $656.8 million for all 1987.    The bad news at First Republic reverberated through Dallas. The huge fourth-quarter loss came as some other banks in the state were stabilizing. The contrast heightened concern among regulators and depositors. The bank became the subject of gossip and rumor at cocktail parties. Leaks to the newspapers intensified.    A siege mentality set in at the company's headquarters. At one point, Mr. Fronterhouse invited the publisher and top editors of the Dallas Times Herald to the bank and pressed them to rein in their banking reporter. After The Wall Street Journal reported the bank's projected $450 million loss three weeks ago, Mr. Fronterhouse interrogated top officers about whether they had leaked the contents of a memo containing the forecast. A First Republic executive proposed lie-detector tests to trace the source of a leak from a Saturday meeting of the policy committee. Mr. Fronterhouse rejected the idea.    Employee morale sank as the company proceeded with its post-merger plan to lay off 800 to 1,000 of its 15,239 employees. Some 2,100 workers had already left last year. An energy lender, one of many who departed voluntarily, says he couldn't see a resurgence of energy business for some time. &quot;I had a heart-to-heart discussion with my boss, and he agreed,&quot; he says.    Of more concern than new loans was depositor confidence. Dal-Tile Corp., a privately held tile maker, says it moved some accounts to the Texas Commerce Bancshares unit of Chemical New York to reduce its exposure at First Republic below the $100,000 threshold for federal insurance. Up to $2 million of Dal-Tile's money flowed through First Republic daily in payments received and bills paid. &quot;We do have loyalty to First Republic,&quot; says Charles Nies, Dal-Tile's financial vice president. &quot;We won't pull the other accounts unless service deteriorates.&quot;    Meanwhile, competitors have been picking off accounts, in some cases pointing out to customers First Republic's weakened condition. One small bank collected about $1.5 million in new deposits from First Republic on Friday. &quot;The phone was ringing off the wall all day,&quot; the bank's president says. At River Oaks Bank, Houston's largest independent bank, customers &quot;are calling us before there's an opportunity for us to get to them,&quot; says Robert C. Hewell, the chief executive.    Charles Pistor, a First Republic vice chairman, insists that the outflows, some of which were seasonal, are manageable. Most of the funds came out of the company's Dallas bank, which accounts for only a third of First Republic's deposits, he says. He adds that the bank hasn't had to draw emergency funds from the Federal Reserve.    Mr. Pistor says he expected some withdrawals after Keefe Bruyette downgraded the bank's CDs to a level that carries the explanation &quot;very serious problems, risk at all maturity levels.&quot;    To survive, First Republic must hack away at its pile of nearly $4 billion in nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate, which made up an alarming 15.9% of the company's $33.2 billion in assets at year end. The unpaid interest on those loans in the fourth quarter alone totaled $106 million, Mr. Fronterhouse says.    The company's strategy is to spin off, restructure or recapitalize those assets to reduce their drag on earnings. Basically, it is still a go-it-alone strategy. Mr. Fronterhouse contends that there aren't many other choices. There won't be any out-of-state rescuer, he adds, because &quot;there's not a lot of interest in a Texas bank, as reflected in our stock price.&quot;    First Republic contends that it has enough qualified buyers to handle that much property, including several deep-pocket prospects that could handle $200 million loan packages. Getting rid of those questionable assets would ultimately generate capital and earnings, Mr. Fronterhouse says. Adds Joseph R. Musolino, a First Republic vice chairman, &quot;There is a substantial increase in interest in Texas property.&quot;    First Republic has sold $43 million of foreclosed real estate since June and is negotiating to sell an additional $35 million. Most of it has been priced at 90% of First Republic's book value on the property, although Mr. Musolino concedes that some current negotiations might fall through.    But the bank has a long way to go before it can declare its crisis over. Its common stockholder equity capital, the clearest measure of its ability to absorb losses, was $812 million at year end, a slender 2.4% of assets. Overall, the company has $3.24 billion in capital, or 9.4% of assets. But that includes loan-loss reserves and preferred stockholder equity.    To raise capital, Mr. Fronterhouse is trying to sell the company's headquarters building and is considering the sale of its credit-card business. He has also ordered managers to slash operating budgets. Customer-entertainment budgets are being halved, and travel budgets are being shaved 15%.    At a top-level management meeting last month, Mr. Fronterhouse trotted out Robert L. Crandall, the chief executive of American Airlines and its parent, AMR Corp., and a First Republic director, to deliver a strong message on the importance of cost-cutting. Mr. Crandall, by reputation a ruthless cost-cutter, told managers to approach the budget process as if their jobs, and the bank's future, were at stake.    First Republic's fate is likely to be decided this year. Federal regulators aren't sure that the bank can absorb another year of big losses. What the bank really needs, they say, is an improved state economy.    The company has two stated goals -- to achieve $140 million in cost savings from the InterFirst consolidation and to survive. The former has been achieved. As for the latter, &quot;It's not clear whether they can pull off what they set out to do,&quot; says Paul M. Horvitz, a banking professor at the University of Houston and a former FDIC research director.    ---      First RepublicBank Corp.'s Troubled Condition                           1985         1986         1987* Net income (In millions)            $140.2       $54.0       ($656.8) Non-performing loans (In millions)            $541         $853         $3,922 As a percentage of total assets          3.54%        5.68%        15.86 Common stock price       $33.13       $19.00       $3.75   Note: Parantheses indicate loss   *Preliminary.
