America's major trading partners in Europe and Asia see Mr. Bush as continuing President Reagan's opposition to protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress, and his commitment to arms control and other measures designed to ease Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union.    &quot;This is a great relief to us to see (Mr. Bush) elected,&quot; said Hong Kong's director of trade, Michael Sze, because &quot;we can look to him to continue the free-trade policies of the Reagan administration.&quot; Added an Indonesian trade official: &quot;Protectionist pressure in Congress will remain, but it's good that Bush can fight that like Reagan did.&quot;    Japanese officials don't see a Bush presidency necessarily easing any of the areas of friction between Tokyo and Washington -- including trade, investment and military spending -- but are pleased they won't have to develop a new working relationship with an unfamiliar administration. &quot;We are confident the process we have learned over the past eight years will be able to solve pending issues,&quot; said Yukio Okamoto, a Foreign Ministry official.    While Japanese officials don't think policies would have been much different under Mr. Dukakis, even the best efforts by a Dukakis administration and Tokyo would have taken at least a year to develop &quot;true channels of communications,&quot; said Kazuo Aichi, a ruling-party legislator.    The reaction was similar on foreign policy. Noting that the president-elect has repeatedly pledged to continue Mr. Reagan's approach to international matters, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said: &quot;I don't foresee a rise in (superpower) tension. More likely a rapprochement, a fresh dialogue that could give a new impulse to this policy of openness (in Moscow).&quot;    Indeed, one of Mr. Bush's first acts -- announcing that James A. Baker III would be his secretary of state -- seemed proof of continuity on foreign policy. Mr. Baker, who was Mr. Bush's campaign manager, served the Reagan administration as chief of staff and secretary of the Treasury and is familiar to many world leaders.    Even Moscow commented that Mr. Bush's election shows the American public supports Mr. Reagan's arms control efforts. &quot;We note with satisfaction that the American electorate express their views with regard to the continuation of arms control negotiations and for expanding cooperation between the U.S.A. and the Soviets in all possible areas,&quot; said a Foreign Ministry spokesman.    Radio Moscow added: &quot;The Soviet Union proceeds from the understanding that a dialogue between the two nations will be continued with the new administration, in the interests of nuclear disarmament and world peace.&quot; The official Soviet radio also commented that Mr. Bush had won, in part, by portraying Mr. Dukakis as &quot;a weakling&quot; on foreign policy.    Some observers expressed hope that Mr. Bush would diverge from Mr. Reagan's policies. &quot;We were expecting Bush to win,&quot; commented veteran Egyptian diplomat Tahseen Bashir. But he added: &quot;We hope that he learned from the mistakes of the past eight years in our area, where lack of action leads to disaster and creative action bears fruit to all people in the region.&quot;    Other foreign-policy experts said they expect Mr. Bush's Latin American agenda to grow beyond what they called Mr. Reagan's obsession with Nicaragua's Sandinista government, and tackle concerns from Mexican stability to debt relief.    &quot;Bush in fact has a greater appreciation of the importance of Latin America, in particular Mexico and Central America, than probably most any of his predecessors,&quot; said Georges Fauriol, director of the Latin American Studies Program at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. Said William Rogers, former assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs: &quot;I think because it makes sense and because he comes from nearby Texas, Bush would first make a major policy statement on Mexico.&quot;    &quot;I don't think he will want to go to the mat with Congress on the Contras,&quot; added Mr. Rogers, who sees an end to the U.S. policy of backing the anti-Sandinista guerrillas in Nicaragua, which has been a constant theme of the Reagan administration. Yet in Miami, Contra director Adolfo Calero, calling Mr. Bush &quot;a strong friend of the Nicaraguan resistance,&quot; said the victory would keep alive the rebels' chances of winning new U.S. military aid. And Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega called for face-to-face talks with the president-elect and said he didn't believe Mr. Bush would &quot;fall into the stupidity of . . . repeating a policy which has already been tested and has failed.&quot;    Brazil, the Third World's biggest debtor, also welcomed the Bush victory. Brasilia had worried that a Dukakis administration would have had a more protectionist tone, making it more difficult for Brazil to export to the U.S. and therefore service its $118 billion debt.    &quot;The Republicans are hard, but clear (on free trade),&quot; Foreign Minister Roberto de Abreu Sodre said before the U.S. election results were known. &quot;If they win, we know the rules of the game.&quot;    While many Europeans welcomed the continuity they see in a Bush presidency, enthusiasm seemed moderated by doubts about Mr. Bush's ability -- given an incoming Congress that is even more Democratic than the present one -- to deal with crucial problems, including the U.S. trade and budget deficits and the specter of protectionism.    While Sweden's premier, Ingvar Carlsson, said the Bush win had &quot;underscored continuity in American foreign policy,&quot; the director of London's Institute for European Defense and Strategic Studies voiced doubt about Mr. Bush's ability to deal with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Institute director Gerald Frost said, &quot;There is no doubt we have the best Soviet Communist Party leader for a very long time. His ability to connect ideas, to play to people in constituencies in the West . . . is outstanding.&quot; Whether Mr. Bush &quot;is capable of dealing with that situation remains to be seen.&quot;    It also isn't clear to some Europeans how Mr. Bush will reconcile U.S. defense commitments to Europe with Washington's urgent need to cut its trade and budget deficits.    &quot;We have to find out now whether (Mr. Bush) is sufficiently tough or determined to either meet those (defense) costs, or whether he's going to have sufficient skill to encourage Europeans to do more,&quot; Mr. Frost said. </TEXT></DOC>
