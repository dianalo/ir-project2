Ten years after the Iran hostage crisis poisoned U.S.-Iranrelations, 61 percent in the Media General-Associated Press pollsaid Washington should offer to resume normal ties if Iran got theAmericans in Lebanon freed.   Support was somewhat lower for releasing Iranian assets lockedin U.S. banks in trade for the hostages' freedom, with 50 percentin favor. And respondents overwhelmingly rejected paying ransomdirectly to the captors, with 85 percent opposed.   Respondents divided evenly on the idea of direct negotiationswith the hostage takers, while most favored indirect negotiations.A majority favored military action, but that fell to a minority ifthe hostages might be killed in the effort.   Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are held inLebanon, most by groups believed loyal to Iran. Iran has offered tohelp free the captives if its assets held in U.S. banks werereleased.   It is unclear to what extent Iran controls the captors, if atall. In the poll, though, 72 percent said they believed Iran doescontrol the hostage takers, and 79 percent said Iran supportsinternational terrorism.   Iran and the United States have been estranged since Nov. 4,1979, when Iranian students, apparently with official support,seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 Americans hostage.   They were held for 444 days, crippling President Carter'sadministration and contributing to his defeat in the 1980 election.A rescue attempt failed, killing eight servicemen, and theprisoners were freed only on Jan. 20, 1981, the day of RonaldReagan's inauguration.   Reagan and now President Bush have labored with another hostagecrisis, the Americans captive in Lebanon. Longest held is Terry A.Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,kidnapped in March 1985.   Washington's official position has been that negotiating for thecaptives' release would encourage more hostage taking. Forty-sevenpercent in the poll nonetheless favored direct negotiations, while45 percent opposed the idea. The rest were unsure.   A majority, 55 percent, favored indirect negotiations through athird party such as the Red Cross.   Respondents at first blush supported military action, with 62percent favoring the use of U.S. forces to try to free thehostages. But if the hostages might be killed in a rescue attempt _something strategists have been unable to rule out _ just 43percent supported it.   Military action was more popular with men and with people whodescribed themselves as conservatives, while liberals and womenwere more apt to favor some form of negotiation. Fifty-four percentof the women supported direct talks with the hostage takers,compared with 40 percent of the men.   The poll found some dismay at the length of the crisis, with 54percent saying the United States has not done enough to try to freethe hostages. Yet there was a split in expectations of whether theyever will be freed: Forty-two percent thought they would, 37percent thought not, and 21 percent were unsure.   The survey was conducted by telephone Sept. 14-24 among a randomsample of 1,071 adults in the continental United States, and had amargin of error of 3 percentage points.
