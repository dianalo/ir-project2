The spatial resolution of DSA images of 6'' field size of imageintensifier using a 1024 x 1024 x 12 bit matrix is better than thoseusing a 512 x 512 x 8 bit matrix and is not inferior to that of conventionalangiography. IADSA using this system may replace conventional film-screenangiography.</TEXT></DOC>
