The Ukraine's Donetsk basin, the Soviet Union's largestcoal-producing area, and other coal regions were paralyzed by thesummer strikes. Miners went back to work after the Kremlin promisedto meet virtually all their demands for better working conditions,improved supplies of consumer goods and more financial independence.   But Ukrainian miners' representatives say those promises havenot been kept. They voted Thursday against immediately resuming thegiant strike but decided to poll workers to see how much supportthere was for renewing it.   Alexander Nikolaevich Tupikin, a member of the Donetsk strikecommittee, said by telephone that the decisions of all individualmines and work shifts should be known by Tuesday.   On that day, a council representing workers from throughout theregion will meet, ``sum up all the opinions and decide what thenext step should be,'' he said.   Soviet officials have said a renewed round of miners' strikescould force a rationing of heat and light as the winter sets inbecause of a reduction of coal.   Earlier this month, the Supreme Soviet legislature passed a lawbanning strikes in such vital areas as energy, defense andtransport.   The law didn't stop 18,000 miners in the northern region ofVorkuta from holding a one-day strike Thursday to demand theKremlin make good on the promised benefits, as well as end theCommunist Party's monopoly on power.   The strikers decided to return to work at all but one mine afterhearings on the illegal strike began in regional court, Vorkutastrike committee member Sergei Masolovich said by telephone.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Thursday ``strongadministrative measures through the prosecutor and the court''might be taken to discourage wildcat strikes.</TEXT></DOC>
