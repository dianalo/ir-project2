As of Friday, oil prices have plunged exactly $4, or nearly 25%, from the day last May that Tenneco announced it was planning to sell its oil company. And although Tenneco's oil assets could still fetch the predicted $5 billion to $7 billion, recent oil-price uncertainty may well damp the sales price.    Based on different companies' oil-market forecasts, &quot;the price could be $2 billion to $3 billion apart,&quot; said Ron W. Haddock, executive vice president American Petrofina Inc., Dallas, which bid for Tenneco's more than 400 gasoline stations as well as its oil reserves along the U.S. Gulf Coast.    Tenneco, which has far-flung interests in manufacturing and other industries, is selling its major oil company to reduce its swollen debt load. Friday was the deadline for submitting bids, and a Tenneco spokesman said the company expects to announce the winners within two weeks and to complete the sales before year end.    Picking winners -- or a single winner -- could be laborious because Tenneco has broken up its oil and gas properties into eight geographic regions and is selling its gasoline stations separately from its Louisiana refinery. Companies were able to bid on any package as well as make an offer for the whole unit.    With last week's price volatility and other factors in mind, oil company officials were scrambling to meet the deadline. &quot;We're just waiting for a phone call&quot; from a potential bidding partner, said an edgy executive with one large company that was planning a bid. But to Tenneco, a change in industry long-term perceptions is more significant than the one-day price collapse of Friday, when most crude oil prices fell by 50 cents a barrel or more.    &quot;From a whole variety of contacts -- both commercial companies and some of our dealings with the major OPEC producers -- there is a growing feeling that an extended period of lower prices may be in the offing,&quot; said Dennis Eklof, a director at the consulting firm, Cambridge Energy Research Associates. &quot;The psychology of the situation is such that it will affect the bids,&quot; he added.    But other industry officials dismissed the recent price downturn. &quot;Some of the Tenneco gas reserves are good for 20 years, possibly as long as 30 years,&quot; said an exploration and production official at a major oil company. &quot;The pricing for a year, or even two years, doesn't have a heck of a lot of impact on the cash-flow stream for a number of years.&quot;    And although Friday's oil-market selloff may have confirmed companies' bearish price outlooks, the major oil company official doubted that companies lowered their bids at the last minute. &quot;If you're going to lower your bids, your concern is the big boys won't change,&quot; he said.    In fact, industry speculation continues to suggest that the biggest of the big boys, Exxon Corp., bid aggressively for prized assets -- or perhaps the entire package of properties. A mid-level Exxon executive said a few months ago that he doubted the giant could move swiftly enough to make a bid for everything Tenneco is selling. Nevertheless, Exxon has been criticized for funneling its tremendous cash flow into repurchasing its own stock rather than into acquisitions.    &quot;If Exxon decided to make a takeout for the whole thing,&quot; said an industry official, &quot;they'd do their analysis just like everybody else -- and then add a billion dollars to it.&quot; Exxon wouldn't comment on whether it made a bid, citing company policy, as did other potential bidders.    Another big question mark is Tenneco director Joe Foster, the disgruntled head of the oil company who voted against the sale. Mr. Foster was trying to arrange a leveraged buy-out of the unit, and reportedly has arranged financing for a bid, though industry sources were skeptical of his ability to compete with the likes of Exxon, Shell Oil Co. and others.    Mr. Foster couldn't be reached, though in the spring, before the sale announcement, he spoke optimistically about the oil company's outlook. &quot;Come the early '90s, there are going to be some good opportunties,&quot; Mr. Foster said at the time.    The rich stakes combined with lowered price expectations have ruled out bids by many small and medium-sized oil companies; industry officials say individual packages could sell for between $500 million and $2.5 billion or $3 billion.    One drawback on the biggest property -- Tenneco's prized Gulf of Mexico oil and gas reserves -- involves a condition imposed by Tenneco: The owner must agree to sell most of the natural-gas production to Tenneco's pipeline unit at often-disadvantaged spot-market prices. In addition, Tenneco has insisted that the buyer of any property assume such liabilities as employee severance costs, industry officials said.    Some major companies, including Phillips Petroleum Co. and Texaco Inc., said they didn't bid because of internal financial constraints. Another major, Unocal Corp., isn't expected to bid, and some industry officials questioned whether Amoco Corp., which just completed a $4 billion acquisition in Canada, would go after more properties. </TEXT></DOC>
