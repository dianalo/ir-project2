The Fed announced Tuesday it was raising its discount rate to6.5 percent from 6 percent, to help curb inflation and to accountfor the recent rise of open-market interest rates.   The discount rate is the interest the central bank charges onloans to member banks. A change in the closely-watched rate is themost dramatic move the Fed can make in signaling its creditpolicies.   Because the banks set their interest rates based on how much itcosts them to borrow money, many economists predict other rateswill edge higher due to Tuesday's action. That likely will meanconsumers will have to pay more for credit on houses, cars anditems charged on credit cards.   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we had another (bank) prime ratehike by Friday,'' said David Resler, chief economist for NomuraSecurities Inc.   Financial markets reacted quickly to Tuesday's move, with thedollar soaring and stock and bond prices falling sharply.   The dollar jumped to 135.15 Japanese yen in New York from133.725 yen late Monday, and rose sharply against other majorcurrencies.   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell28.27 points to 2,079.13 amid speculation of further rateincreases. It was down 33 points more by midday today.   In the credit markets, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bondfell by about $10 per $1,000 face amount, while its yield jumped to9.19 percent from 9.10 percent late Monday.   A month ago, major banks boosted their prime lending rates to9.5 percent, the highest level in more than two years, from 9percent in response to rising interest rates in the credit markets,which had boosted the banks' cost of borrowing.   The prime is a key rate used to calculate a range of fixed andadjustable-rate corporate and consumer loans.   Many economists had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on themoney supply this week, but few were expecting a discount rate hike.   ``The (credit) markets have been screaming for a discount rateincrease for quite some time; the surprise was in the timing ofit,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers HanoverTrust Co.   ``Not only is the Republican convention coming up, but we're inthe middle of a Treasury refunding,'' in which the government isauctioning off $22 billion in new notes this week to pay off itsold debts, Kellner said.   ``I don't think inflation is any worse today than it was lastyear,'' said Kellner.   Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko SecuritiesCo. International Inc., defended the discount-rate hike.   ``It's the Fed's job to throw cold water on the economy when itstarts overheating and that's what it appears to be doing rightnow,'' he said.   Among recent signs of economic strength was the Julyunemployment rate, which at 5.4 percent was near its 14-year lows.   Tuesday's increase brings the discount rate to its highest levelsince April 1986, when it was lowered to 6.5 percent from 7 percent.   The hike was the second since Alan Greenspan replaced Paul A.Volcker at the Fed's helm a year ago. On Sept. 4, the central bankraised the rate for the first time in three years, to 6 percentfrom 5.5 percent.   While September's increase also was taken in response toinflationary fears, some analysts later cited it as a contributingfactor to the Oct. 19 stock market crash.</TEXT></DOC>
