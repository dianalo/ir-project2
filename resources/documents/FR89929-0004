Becauseof the exigent circumstance of the Office being newly created and requiringfunds to operate, the regulation is adopted effective on publication inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>September 29, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Jerome L. Edelstein, Deputy Director,Regulations and Legislation Division, (202) 906-7057, or Christopher T.Curtis, Attorney, (202) 906-6077, Office of Thrift Supervision, Departmentof the Treasury, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20552.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Section 9 of the Home Owners' LoanAct of 1933 (``HOLA''), as amended by the Financial Institutions Reform,Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (``FIRREA''), authorizes the Directorto fund the Office's general expenses by imposing fees on savings associationsand related entities. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 9 authorize theDirector to impose examination fees, in proportion to assets or resources,on savings associations and their affiliates. These provisions are comparableto the statutory authority under which the Office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency (``OCC'') assesses fees to cover the expenses of its operations.(See 12 U.S.C. 482.) Section 9(k) states that the Director may assess anadditional fee to cover direct and indirect expenses of the Office on institutionsfor which the Director is the ``appropriate Federal banking agency'' undersection 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Section 9(<T3>1</T3>) authorizes the Director to establish a working-capital fund,which would be funded by charging any or all of the foregoing fees at ratesin excess of actual expenses. In addition, section 9(g) authorizes theDirector to impose additional, specific fees to recover the costs of examinationsof the fiduciary activities of savings associations that exercise fiduciarypowers and of examinations of any savings association or affiliate in excessof two per year. Under section 9(j), the Director may, in his discretion,assess fees to cover the costs of processing applications and other submissionsto the Office. The Director hereby adopts this temporary emergency regulation to implementhis authority to collect fees to fund the Office's operations pending establishmentof a permanent funding mechanism. This regulation provides for generalassessments on savings associations under paragraph (a) of section 9, proportionalto assessed institutions' assets, and enables the Director to establisha working-capital fund as authorized by the statute. In addition, the regulationprovides authority for the Director to assess, on an interim basis, otherfees authorized by the statute: examination fees to be assessed on affiliatedentities, fees pursuant to section 9(k), fees to cover the costs of fiduciaryexaminations, and fees to cover the Office's costs of processing applicationsand other submissions. Under this regulation, the Director will calculate the assessment on savingsassociations under section 9(a) as a simple percentage of assets and willapply the same percentage of assets to each institution assessed. (A differentpercentage may determine assessments on affiliates, reflecting the separatestatutory treatment of assessments on affiliates.) This approach implementsthe statutory directive that the assessment be ``in proportion to the [association's]assets or resources.'' However, the Director believes that other approacheswould also be consistent with that statutory directive. For example, itwould be within the Director's statutory mandate to base the assessmenton a sliding scale of assets_<T3>e.g.</T3>, a particular percentage of assets up to 100 million dollars,and a different percentage of assets over 100 million dollars. The OCCfollows such an approach under a similar statutory scheme. The Directoris not tied to the approach embodied in the present interim regulation,and may adopt a different approach in the future as he deems appropriate.In drafting this regulation, the Director has looked as appropriate toregulations that had been promulgated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board(``Bank Board''), the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation andthe OCC. For example, the regulation's provision in paragraph (f) for collectionof certain examination fees is drawn from an equivalent regulation of theFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, 12 CFR 563.17-1(a) (1988).The Director is also adopting a collection process used by the Bank Boardand the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to collect insuranceassessments and examination fees. (See Bank Board Resolution No. 86-777of July 31, 1986.) Member institutions of Federal Home Loan Banks (``Banks'')that are subject to fees and assessments under this regulation will berequired to establish demand deposit accounts at their Banks and to authorizethe Banks to allow the Director to collect amounts due the Office fromthe institutions by direct debit of those accounts. The Federal HousingFinance Board has adopted a regulation requiring the Banks to participatein this payment mechanism, thereby satisfying the Banks' obligation undersection 9(f) of the HOLA to collect fees and assessments for the Directorupon request (54 FR 36760, Sept. 5, 1989). Institutions not members of a Federal Home Loan Bank shall pay their feesand assessments to the Office upon receipt of notice (except for any processingfees that the Director may impose under section 9(j) of the statute, whichshall accompany submissions to the Office). The Director may also use thispayment mechanism in other circumstances in which it may be appropriate.Following the example of the OCC, see 12 CFR 8.7, the Director will chargeinterest on overdue assessment and fees. The interim assessments that this regulation authorizes are necessary becausethe Office does not have access to funds that were in the accounts of theFederal Home Loan Bank Board on the date of enactment of the FIRREA; thestatute assigns those funds to the Federal Housing Financing Board. Nordoes the Office have access to monies in the FSLIC Resolution Fund. Thestatute assigns that Fund to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.The Bank Board may borrow from the Fund, but only to assist it in windingup its affairs or to pay for its employees or property used in performingfunctions for this Office. This Office must therefore raise funds directlyfrom the institutions that it regulates to compensate employees transferredto it and to pay other costs that it incurs. The interim assessments arecontemplated to be levied only on savings associations, because only theyare covered by the data base and payment system established by the BankBoard which the Office, in the interest of expedition, will use to collectthe assessment. Because savings associations are the core group in theOffice's regulatory mandate, and because the Office's interim expenseswill not be great, funding those expenses by an assessment on savings associationsis equitable. The Director does, however, reserve the authority in theregulation to assess the other entities of an interim basis should thatprove to be necessary and feasible. <ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Procedure Act</ITAG>The Director is adopting this regulation as a final rule effective on publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, without the usual notice and comment periodor delayed effective date provided for in the Administrative ProcedureAct, 5 U.S.C. 553. Those requirements may be waived for ``good cause.''5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), 553(d)(3). The Director finds that good cause existsbecause of the urgent necessity of establishing a mechanism to meet theOffice's immediate funding needs following its establishment by enactmentof the FIRREA. Similarly, providing notice and comment procedures and adelayed effective date would be contrary to the public interest becausethe Office could not immediately discharge its statutory responsibilities.The Director is continuing to consider the subject of this regulation andwill publish for comment a proposed regulation establishing a permanentfunding mechanism incorporating the various fees and assessments that HOLA,as amended by FIRREA, authorizes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this regulation,the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) do not apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The aggregate effect of this rule, intended to raise funds for the Officefor a period of only a few months, is expected to be small. In terms ofExecutive Order 12291, the rule is not likely to ``result in: (1) An annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) A major increase incosts or prices for consumers, individual industries, or geographic regions;or (3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.''The rule is therefore not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of the ExecutiveOrder, and does not require a Regulatory Impact Statement. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 502</ITAG>Assessments, Federal home loan banks.Accordingly, the Director hereby adopts part 502, subchapter A, chapterV, title 12 Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below.
