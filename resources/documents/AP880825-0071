This correspondent, traveling by motor launch from the Thaimainland, found no Burmese immigration officials at their posts andwas told all army and police units had withdrawn Wednesday to anarea about one mile from this prosperous market town.   The pullout, student leaders said, came after President MaungMaung announced that the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party wouldnext month hold an emergency congress to consider popular demandsfor a return to democracy.   About 300 workers, merchants and students today marched throughVictoria Point, known as Kawthaung in Burmese, asking others tojoin them in further demonstrations in coming days. Two jeeps werepacked with students.   ``We'll continue to demonstrate. We want elections as soon aspossible,'' said student leader Nyi Htwe, calling Maung Maung'spromises of democracy ``a political trick.''   He said there was support among demonstrators for Aung Gyi, aleading dissident released today from nearly a month'simprisonment. But the 21-year-old Rangoon University senioradmitted uncertainty over Burma's future.   ``Only Lord Buddha can know what will happen in the future,'' hesaid, speaking at the student headquarters set up in the town'shigh school.   Nyi Htwe claimed the intelligence network set up by studentorganizations in Rangoon was reporting that authorities in otherBurmese cities similarly had surrendered control and in some areaswere cooperating with anti-government forces.   He said a volunteer defense group was being organized among thetown's 80,000 residents to help maintain law and order.   Students said that they carried no weapons and there had been nobloodshed as demonstrators confronted troops in the town last week.   They described some soldiers applauding as protesters gatheredoutside a military compound pleading with them to refrain fromusing force. They said about 70 soldiers from the Mergui-based101st Division had been stationed in the town, armed with automaticweapons and U.S.-made M-79 grenade launchers.   In earlier demonstrations in Rangoon and other areas, troopsopened fire on crowds of protesters and hundreds of casualties werereported.   Nyi Htwe said he and about 100 other students from Rangoon hadarrived at Victoria Point in July to begin directinganti-government agitation. He said most of the students were formerresidents of the town, located on an island off the southern tip ofBurma, about 490 miles southeast of Rangoon.   University and high school students have spearheaded theuprisings against 26 years of authoritarian rule, but Buddhistmonks, laborers, professionals and even government civil servantsswelled their ranks as the protests intensified.   The town appeared calm despite the ongoing demonstrations.   The central market was open and passers-by looked at postersaffixed to walls of low-slung houses.   One poster showed ousted President Sein Lwin, widely heldresponsible for ordering troops to fire on protesters, with an M-16rifle and a bandoleer stuffed with bullets slung around his neck.It read: ``Sein Lwin is Rambo.''   Another depicted Ne Win, who resigned as Burma's leader lastmonth, as a dog perched on a chair with Maung Maung sitting underhim and Sein Lwin off to one side and labeled ``running dog.''   Maung Maung, although a civilian, has been closely associatedwith Ne Win and the authoritarian system for decades and isconsidered unacceptable by many anti-government protesters.   Victoria Point is one of the few points along the Thai-Burmeseborder where Thai nationals are officially allowed access. Most ofthe border is controlled by ethnic minority rebels fighting theRangoon government.   The town has prospered and its population has mushroomed becauseof trade with Thailand and two-way smuggling. As tension mounted inrecent weeks, Burmese authorities closed the entry pointintermittently.   But after a 20-minute boat ride from the Thai town of Ranongtoday, no officials were at dockside to inspect border passes.</TEXT></DOC>
