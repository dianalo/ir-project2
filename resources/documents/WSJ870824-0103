Since then the terrorist Tamil Tigers have laid low, but trouble still stalks the Colombo government.    At least 70 people have died in Sinhalese protests against the peace plan. Mr. Jayewardene has handed over part of his authority to the Indian army, which has sent 6,000 troops and three warships to Sri Lanka to help enforce the accord. And on Wednesday the Sri Lankan president barely escaped an apparent assassination attempt that left at least 15 members of Parliament wounded, and one dead. The July 29 accord may yet backfire, leaving the Marxist Tamil Tigers to feed off the carcass of a pro-Western, capitalist democracy.    Mr. Jayewardene had little alternative but to accept Indian intervention. In the past, when he has asked the Reagan administration for arms and help in counterinsurgency training, he's been met with a quiet no, and a nudge toward India.    That kind of response from the U.S. poses a problem for both Mr. Jayewardene and Mr. Gandhi. India's southern state of Tamil Nadu has been the refuge and chief source of arms for the guerrillas who threatened Sri Lanka in the first place. Sri Lanka, with its relatively small, 38,000-man military force, can't simply dismiss Indian intrusions.    Two months ago, for example, the Sri Lankan army was engaged in a reasonably successful campaign against the guerrillas. When Mr. Gandhi then sent the Indian air force to drop food and medicine into some of the besieged rebel territory, Mr. Jayewardene was powerless to stop the planes. Small wonder, then, that Mr. Jayewardene made the huge concession of promising a largely self-governing homeland to Sri Lanka's Tamils.    So far, Mr. Gandhi seems determined to honor his part of the bargain. From their new posts in Sri Lanka, his troops have been collecting truckloads of weapons from the guerrillas. But the New York Times reports that the Tamils have surrendered only a small fraction of their weapons. True, Wednesday's grenade attack on President Jayewardene and his colleagues most likely was made by Sinhalese extremists. But if there have been no fresh Tamil terrorist attacks, neither has there been much news about shutdowns of Tamil Tiger hideouts in southern India.    However honorable his intentions, it's not at all clear that Mr. Gandhi has the ability to shut down the Tigers for good. Back home, he has plenty of his own problems, from a surly bureaucracy to Sikh terrorists to restless Gurkhas to troubled borders with Pakistan and China. He walks a fine line in dealing with the separatist movement in India's own Tamil state.    Should Mr. Gandhi's intentions be thwarted by the political pressures he faces in his own country, it is hard to see how Mr. Jayewardene could do much about it. Those 6,000 Indian peacekeeping troops could prove hard for Mr. Jayewardene to dislodge.    We trust that both Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jayewardene are fully aware of the dangers they face. But it wouldn't hurt, even at this late date, if the Reagan administration offered Mr. Jayewardene more help. </TEXT></DOC>
