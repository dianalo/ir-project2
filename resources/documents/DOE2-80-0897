The 'carrot' is built around the 'inevitability'of congressional action on acid rain, and the 'stick' implies what willhappen if agreement on a control program is not reached. There is costlylegislation strikingly similar to the so-called acid rain 'compromises'- the 1970 Clean Air Act. Investment by private industry has resultedin the greater use of lower sulfur coals and in the coal industry's commitmentto providing a cleaner and more efficient fuel with the result that airquality is better than 10 years ago, and sulfur dioxide emissions havedropped 28% since 1973. There is also continuing development of cleancoal technologies offering alternatives to FGD. The proposed acid rainlegislation could have serious economic consequences for utilities andconsumers.</TEXT></DOC>
