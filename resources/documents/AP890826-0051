The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules, saidfour hours of predawn shelling subsided after 7 a.m. intointermittent exchanges of machine gunfire and 60mm mortar roundsacross the city's dividing Green Line.   He said two people were killed and nine wounded in the artilleryduel, which also targeted Christian ports north of the city andSyrian gun emplacements in Moslem west Beirut.   The Cyprus government today halted daily flights by militaryhelicopter between Cyprus and Lebanon's besieged Christian enclave,sources reported.   A Lebanese embassy source, speaking on condition of anonymity,confirmed the ban and called it ``a temporary measure.''   The Cyprus government declined comment, but one source said theban was imposed because Lebanon violated an agreement to use theflights for humanitarian purposes only and was using them to carryChristian military personnel.   The helicopter flights and a daily hydrofoil service between theChristian port of Jounieh and the Cypriot port of Larnaca, next tothe airport, have been the Christian enclave's only links with theoutside world.   By police count, 796 people have been killed and 2,231 woundedsince the fighting began March 8 between Christian army commanderGen. Michel Aoun's troops and Syrian forces backed by Moslem militiaallies.   The spokesman said ``the intensity of the Syrian-Christianclashes has diminished noticeably'' since Soviet envoy GennadyTarasov arrived Wednesday on a mission to halt the latest round ofviolence in Lebanon's 14-year-civil war.   Tarasov, who heads the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Middle Eastdepartment, talked with Aoun and Moslem Lebanese leaders beforeleaving Friday for Damascus for meetings with Syrian officials.   Syria, a close Soviet ally, claims to be in full agreement withMoscow over Lebanon, which it considers within its sphere ofinfluence. But Tarasov's talks with Aoun contradicted the Syrianrefusal to accept the Maronite Catholic general as a negotiatingpartner.   Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' against Syria. He saysSyria's 40,000 troops, in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate, have betrayed their mission by fighting on theMoslem side.   Tarasov said after meeting Aoun on Friday the Soviet Union``strongly believes there are no military solutions to the Lebaneseproblems.''   A source close to Aoun, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthe general told Tarasov of his ``full readiness to cooperate withthe Soviet effort'' on Lebanon.   He said the Soviet envoy was working on ``a formula accepted toall for stabilizing the security situation and lifting theblockade'' imposed by Syria on the 310-square-mile Christian enclavenorth of Beirut.   Syria and its allies laid siege to the enclave in retaliation forAoun's March 6 blockade of illegal militia-run ports south of Beirutaimed at retrieving lost taxes estimated at $100 million annually.   A senior Moslem official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said Tarasov ``offered Soviet guarantees covering the security partof a plan to defuse the situation and address the political crisis.''   Lebanon's Moslems, who make up a majority of the country'spopulation, are seeking political reform guaranteeing an equal shareof power with the traditionally dominant Christians.   The Moslem official said the Soviet mission focused on reviving athree-member Arab League mediation committee's peace effort inLebanon.   The committee, comprising leaders of Morocco, Saudi Arabia andAlgeria, said July 28 it had reached an impasse because Syriarefused to agree to setting a timetable for pulling its troops outof Lebanon.   Syrian-Christian clashes escalated sharply after the committee'sreport, which Aoun considered a victory for his cause.   The Moslem source said the Soviet diplomatic effort ``did notcontradict'' the deployment of a flotilla of French warships in theeastern Mediterranean off the Lebanese coast.   ``The Soviet effort is the carrot and the French naval buildup isthe stick,'' the source said.   He added that the French naval presence ``is a message'' to theSyrians and their allies that ``storming through the (Christian)enclave is not permitted.''   ``It is the same message that Tarasov delivered at the diplomaticlevel,'' he saidl.   There have been reports the Syrians and Moslems militias wereplanning to launch massive ground attacks against the enclave, hometo about 1 million Christians.</TEXT></DOC>
