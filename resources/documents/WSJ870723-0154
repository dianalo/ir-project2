The increase in the department's consumer price index, which amounted to a 4.3% compound annual rate, included a 1.5% rise in energy costs. For the first six months of the year the index has risen at a 5.4% annual rate, largely because of the surge in energy. A big decline in oil prices was the primary factor holding the index to a 1.1% rise in 1986.    June's 0.4% rise is unlikely to rekindle the fears expressed earlier this year that a dangerous acceleration in inflation was beginning. Moreover, the increase is well below the 0.9% rumored yesterday in some financial markets.    Still, several economists suggested that while a turnaround in energy was expected this year, the rise has been sharper and longer than was generally anticipated. &quot;We just can't kick energy,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University. &quot;An issue we thought would be behind us is still around. Energy prices are going to be higher in 1987 than we thought a few months ago.&quot;    Joel Popkin, president of an economic consulting firm here, said, &quot;It's clear energy is going to be the big question mark during the rest of the year.&quot; Last month's rise reflected spurts in the price of gasoline and electricity.    Food prices also increased sharply last month, rising 0.7% after a 0.6% rise in May. The department said the jump reflected substantial increases in the cost of beef, pork, fresh fruit and vegetables. Poultry prices, however, fell for the 10th consecutive month.    Excluding food and energy, which sometimes vary widely from month to month, consumer prices rose 0.2% after a 0.3% rise in May. Mr. Popkin said, &quot;Excluding food and energy, inflation has been quite low in the last three months.&quot;    A bright note in the report was an 0.8% drop in apparel costs. Earlier this year sharp rises in clothing prices, which are sensitive to imports, raised fears that the decline of the dollar in foreign-exchange trading was causing significant price increases in the U.S. Mr. Popkin said, however, that the drop in apparel prices, along with moderation in the prices of home furnishings and some recreational goods, suggests that the dollar's drop isn't having much effect.    Several economists suggested that a relatively sluggish economy and modest wage gains are leading consumers to resist price increases. &quot;You can't push cost pressures on to American consumers,&quot; said Mr. Ratajczak.    The figures are adjusted for seasonal variation. Before adjustment, the consumer price index rose 0.4% in June and stood at 340.1% of its 1967 average, up 3.7% from a year earlier. Beginning with the January report, the department has revised the index to reflect new consumer-spending patterns and population shifts, among other things. For comparison purposes, the department said the old index rose 0.6% in June before adjustment.    The index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, a measure that includes half the number of people covered by the broader index and is used in adjusting for Social Security and retirement benefits, increased 0.4% in both May and June. Before adjustment, this index was up 0.4% to 334.9% of its 1967 average and was 3.7% above a year earlier.    The Labor Department said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers fell 0.4% in June after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors. These earnings rose a revised 0.6% in May. Previously, the department said earnings gained 0.4% in May.    The latest figure reflected a 0.2% increase in average hourly earnings and a 0.3% decline in hours worked.    Weekly earnings of U.S. workers averaged $311.81 after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors, down from $312.01 in May. Before seasonal adjustment, average weekly earnings rose to $312.55 from $310.76.    Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for June.                                       % change from                                    May          June                                    1987         1986   All items ...................... 0.4          3.7   Food and beverage .............. 0.7          5.1   Housing ........................ 0.3          2.8   Apparel ....................... -0.8          4.9   Transportation ................. 0.5          2.6   Medical care ................... 0.7          6.8   Entertainment .................. 0.1          3.1   Other .......................... 0.6          5.9   June consumer price indexes for various metropolitan areas(1967 equals 100), together with the percentage increasesfrom June 1986, were:   U.S. City Average ............. 340.1         3.7   Chicago ....................... 345.0         4.4   Detroit ....................... 330.2         2.9   Los Angeles ................... 344.2         3.9   New York ...................... 340.6         5.5   Philadelphia .................. 339.0         5.4   San Francisco ................. 353.5         2.8   Dallas-Fort Worth ............. 354.1         2.7   Houston ....................... 341.5         2.5   Pittsburgh .................... 338.9         3.1</TEXT></DOC>
