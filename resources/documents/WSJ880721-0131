But the plans mark a scaled-back approach from NBC's original intentions. In addition, the new channel will charge cable operators twice the rates charged by Financial News Network Inc., the cable channel that will be NBC's biggest rival in the business-news field.    In a bid to entice local cable systems into carrying the new channel, General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit also said it will offer to share 20% of the venture's ad revenue with local operators, starting in its third year, if they sign up early for the new service. That would rebate several million dollars a year to the locals, reducing the channel's higher per-viewer charge.    NBC announced the new plans yesterday for CNBC (Consumer News and Business Channel). It is the first cable channel ever started by a broadcast network, at a time when cable has siphoned away millions of network viewers.    NBC had first announced plans to buy its way into the cable business last May by acquiring the Tempo Television channel. Then tax complications forced it to scrap the purchase and lease time on Tempo instead, offering two separate services: business news in the daytime and sports at night.    Now NBC will offer only one combined service, airing sports news only on weekends and airing business news around the clock during the week. That approach aims at filling what NBC sees as a gap in nighttime business news and in consumer news that can appeal to women viewers, advertisers' favorite audience, said Thomas S. Rogers, an NBC vice president.    &quot;The whole key to this is the 24-hour-a-day business news service,&quot; Mr. Rogers said. &quot;Most people work during the day, and a service that airs only in the daytime isn't as attractive.&quot; He hopes to lure women viewers by adding softer feature stories on education costs, personal finance and health costs, he said.    FNN, the biggest financial channel with 30 million subscribers, offers hard-core markets and business news from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, followed by a sports-scores service (including hourly business updates) from 8 to midnight and the TelShop home-shopping service from midnight to 6 a.m.    But David Meister, FNN's president, countered that NBC faces huge programming costs if its new cable channel plans to deliver live business news for all 24 hours of each day. And if CNBC merely reruns earlier reports late into the night, &quot;then it won't have any specific advantage over us.&quot;    &quot;If they're going to program live, it will be very cost-inefficient, and ultimately the cable operators will have trouble paying for it,&quot; Mr. Meister said. NBC plans to charge local cable systems seven cents per subscriber for the new channel, while FNN, which started seven years ago, charges only 3.5 cents per subscriber currently and will charge 5.5 cents beginning in July 1989.    Such issues have led some people in the cable business to question whether NBC has broader ambitions in mind than merely a financial-news channel.    Only a tiny part of the $300 million a year NBC spends on its extensive news operations is devoted to business news. Some in the industry wonder whether NBC might eventually offer all kinds of news on CNBC as a way to further exploit its big news investment.    That would mean competing directly against Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s Cable News Network. NBC has previously been interested in buying all or part of Turner's 24-hour news channel. Starting a rival to CNN might be greeted with suspicion by some cable operators that would be asked to carry the channel, since they themselves own a stake in Turner Broadcasting and, in turn, in CNN.    The new CNBC is likely to start out with about 10 million subscribers early next year. It will be able to draw on the seven million subscribers across the U.S. who tune in to the Tulsa, Okla.-based Tempo channel, which ceases operation upon the debut of CNBC. An additional four million subscribers will get CNBC as part of the offerings of various cable systems owned by Tele-Communications Inc., the largest U.S. cable company, which now is acquiring Tempo's parent, Tempo Enterprises Inc. Other TCI-affiliated systems reaching an extra four million viewers will have the option of signing up for the new NBC service. </TEXT></DOC>
