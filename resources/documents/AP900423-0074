The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by LarryWollersheim of Aspen, Colo.   Still pending before the justices is an appeal by the Church ofScientology of California aimed at overturning a $2.5 million``emotional distress'' award won by Wollersheim.   A California appeals court ruled that the church must payWollersheim $500,000 in compensatory damages and $2 million inpunitive damages.   A trial jury had awarded Wollersheim $30 million in damages butthat amount was reduced by the appeals court.   Scientology was founded by L. Ron Hubbard, who died in 1986.   Scientologists believe they can progress toward spiritualawareness through private sessions in which members' skin responsesto questions are monitored by an electronic device called anE-meter, which Hubbard invented.   The church calls such monitoring sessions ``auditing.''   Wollersheim, a Scientologist from 1969 to 1979, said churchmembers harassed him and tried to drive his novelty business intobankruptcy. Scientology officials denied the charges, but a jury inLos Angeles ruled for Wollersheim.   Upholding the jury's finding that church officials inflictedemotional distress on Wollersheim, the state appeals court lastAugust said, ``There was substantial evidence to support a factualfinding that the auditing, as well as other practices in this case,were conducted in a coercive environment.''   The state court therefore ruled that the church's assertedreligious freedom could not shield it from having to pay thedamages award.   Lawyers for the church are arguing in its appeal that theConstitution ``prohibits courts from imposing emotional distresstort liability based upon peaceful religious practices bypermitting juries to determine that such practices constitutecoercive persuasion.''   The still-pending appeal also raises a due-process challenge tothe $2 million punitive damages award, an issue the justicesalready have under study in another case.   In Wollersheim's appeal rejected today, he accused Scientologyof being ``a mockery of religion'' and a ``religious front.'' Butthe appeal did not appear to ask the court for any remedy except aformal declaration that Scientology is not really religion.   In response, lawyers for the church told the justicesWollersheim's appeal sought ``an advisory opinion (that) could haveno possible effect on the outcome of this case in its presentposture.''   The case is Wollersheim vs. Church of Scientology of California,89-1367.</TEXT></DOC>
