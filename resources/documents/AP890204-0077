HEATH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Diplomatic and political sources havelinked the new president, Gen. Andres Rodriguez, with drugtraffickers and cast doubt on his pledge to lead Paraguay into a newera of democracy.   Rodriguez, who led the bloody coup that ousted President AlfredoStroessner on Thursday, was sworn in as president Friday.   Rodriguez, who held the No. 2 position in the military and wasconsidered a strong Stroessner ally, immediately promised democraticreforms and more human rights protections, but he failed to providedetails.   The coup leader had no comment today on Stroessner's fate. OnThursday, he gave the 76-year-old Stroessner 12 hours to leaveParaguay, a deadline that apparently passed unenforced. Heapparently remained under house arrest.   ``The new president finds himself in a very difficult situation''because of his professional and personal ties to Stroessner, anopposition political leader said today. Rodriguez's daughter ismarried to Stroessner's son, and the generals share twograndchildren.   ``Aside from the strictly political question, this involvesfamily ties,'' the leader said on condition of anonymity.   Up to 200 soldiers, mostly Stroessner loyalists, were killed inbattles with Rodriguez's troops beginning Thursday night, accordingto estimates from Roman Catholic Radio Caritas. The government andhospital officials have refused to comment on the death toll.   By Friday afternoon, Stroessner, Paraguay's president and armycommander-in-chief for 34 years, was under arrest, Rodriguez wassworn as the new president, the armed forces proclaimed loyalty tohim, and the population was quiet. Not even the staunchlypro-Stroessner wing of the ruling Colorado Party rallied toStroessner's side.   In addition to Stroessner, about 30 of his followers werearrested. There was no word of their fate today.   Unconfirmed reports said Friday that Stroessner was going toChile. Gen. Mario Mardones, Santiago police commander, said hebelieved Stroessner was leaving Paraguay today, ``but we do not knowwhere to. Not necessarily Chile.''   Rodriguez initially was enthusiastically endorsed by oppositionleaders who hoped he would offer them a political opening thatStroessner and the militant wing of his party did not.   But academics, foreign observers, and even some Paraguayanleaders already are hinting at a dark side of Rodriguez.   ``He has an exceedingly unsavory reputation,'' John HoytWilliams, a professor of Latin American history at Indiana StateUniversity in Terre Haute, Ind., told the New York Times.   ``I mean really bad, and that's an understatement .... Rodriguezreportedly has provided protection, air fields and an air taxiservice to people smuggling drugs northward,'' Williams said.   The Cox newspaper group, citing a classified U.S. StateDepartment report, said on Friday that Rodriguez is considered bylaw enforcement authorities in Paraguay to be the country's No. 1drug trafficker.   A Western diplomat in Asuncion, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said today that reports are common in Paraguay thatRodriguez allows cocaine traffickers to use an airstrip he owns indeserted Chaco Province along the border with Bolivia.   However, he added, ``Absolutely no proof of that has ever beenoffered.''   Rodriguez, the son of a small-scale farmer, definitely livesbetter than his army salary would seem to allow. His house in aplush neighborhood is a mansion with a fountain in thewell-manicured front yard.   In his biography, ``Paraguay Under Stroessner,'' U.S. academicPaul Lewis said Rodriguez made his fortune from the whisky andcigarette concessions in the early 1960s. It claims he later turnedbigger profits by allowing his extensive property near Asuncion tobe used for drug-trafficking airstrips.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about U.S. reportsof Rodriquez's alleged drug ties, told reporters, ``We won'tcharacterize our relationship to him at this point.''   However, Paraguay's new leader has vowed to press for democracyand ``respect the human rights of everyone to make democracy areality.''   Several thousand citizens cheered Rodriguez, five rows of medalson his shirtfront, as he took the oath of office in the 19th centuryNational Palace.   But Rodriguez, commander of the powerful First Army Corps, saidnothing about elections nor how long his presidency would last.   The coup was provoked when Stroessner, who has been reported inpoor health since prostate surgery five months ago, tried to forceRodriguez into retirement. The dictator's recent shakeups of thearmy also caused widespread resentment among his officers.   Stroessner, who took power by coup in 1954, tortured and killedopponents during his early years in power, human rights groups said.Others were jailed indefinitely, convicted of political crimes orforced into exile. The U.S. government labeled his government adictatorship in 1986.   Under his rule, Paraguay became a haven for fugitive Nazis, drugtraffickers and former dictators. Among the refugees were JosefMengele, the doctor at the Auschwitz death camp, and oustedPresident Anastasio Somoza of Nicaragua.</TEXT></DOC>
