If approved by a federal judge, the class-actionsettlement will bring RJR's total payment to suchshareholders to about $125 million in connection with thecompany's $25 billion buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co. The food and tobacco conglomerate still faces aclass-action suit by former bondholders.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The management team would love to get rid of all lawsuitsrelated to the LBO, and we're almost there,&quot; said Lawrence R.Ricciardi, RJR Nabisco's general counsel, explaining thedecision to settle. In addition to the bondholder suit, atleast three private lawsuits brought by shareholders whoremoved themselves from the class actions are pending. RJRdenies the allegations in all the suits.   Notice of the latest settlement is scheduled to be mailedto shareholders today, plaintiffs' lawyers said. U.S.District Judge Michael B. Mukasey plans to consider approvingthe settlement at a hearing in June. Mr. Ricciardi, the RJRattorney, said some of the settlement is covered byinsurance.   The class action was brought on behalf of former RJRNabisco shareholders and employee stock-option holders whosold their stock after March 30, 1988, but prior to the Oct.20 buy-out. After a public bidding war, KKR eventually paid$109 a share to take control of the company. Prior to thebidding, RJR Nabisco stock traded in the high $40 and low $50range.   The lawsuit alleges that RJR Nabisco's management beforethe buy-out withheld important information about thepossibility of a deal. If the information had been public,the lawsuit alleges, the shares would have traded at a higherprice and class members might have held their shares inanticipation of a deal.   In preparing for a possible trial, plaintiffs' attorneysinterviewed more than 20 RJR Nabisco officials, including F.Ross Johnson, the former chairman. The attorneys neverexpected to get the full $50-plus difference between the LBOprice and the amount the class members received when theysold. But they were preparing to argue that top RJR Nabiscoofficials were reviewing $75-a-share offers as early as April1988 and that public knowledge of the talks would have raisedthe stock price considerably.   Specifically, the class action covers three groups ofshareholders: anyone who sold RJR Nabisco stock after March30, 1988, but prior to the Oct. 20 buy-out; those whoresponded to a May 1988 stock buy-back offer by RJR Nabiscoat $53.50 a share; and those former employees who sold theirstock options back to the company at $53.50 in August 1988.   The payout for class members depends on who they are andwhen they bought and sold their shares. Those who held stockclosest to the buy-out date before selling can expect to getmore than others under the terms of the settlement. That'sbecause plaintiff attorneys allege that the company held backmore evidence as the buy-out grew closer -- such as meetingswith investment bankers and creation of special &quot;goldenparachute&quot; contracts for top management officials -- throughthe summer of 1988. RJR has denied that these actions wererelated to the buy-out.   Employee option holders who sold their shares back to thecompany in August 1988 for $53.50 stand to get up to $8 ashare. Shareholders who bought their RJR Nabisco shares afterMarch 30, 1988, and sold them back to the company in the Maystock buy-back will receive a maximum of 10 cents a share.   In December, a Delaware state judge approved a settlementof a class action brought on behalf of shareholders at thetime of the buy-out. Those plaintiffs alleged that thecompany unfairly favored KKR's $109 offer over a competingbid by Mr. Johnson, then the company chairman. Thatsettlement, up to $55 million, will give shareholders from 11cents to 22 cents a share.   ---   FEDERAL GOVERNMENT is found liable for own mess inSuperfund case.   A federal judge in Philadelphia ruled that the U.S.government will have to pay part of the cost of cleaning up aformer rayon manufacturing plant in Virginia because thegovernment supervised operations there during World War II.The case is apparently the first to extend liability fortoxic dumping from a company to the federal governmentbecause the former War Productions Board oversaw theoperation.   Lawyers involved said the decision, handed down by U.S.District Judge Clarence C. Newcomer, in Philadelphia, hassignificant implications for Superfund cleanup sites wherethere was strong federal supervision and involvement in theperformance of government contracts. The most prominentexample is heavily polluted Love Canal near Niagara Falls,N.Y., where lawyers for Occidental Petroleum Corp. contendthe U.S. Army contributed to the problem by dumping rocketfuel in the 1940s and 1950s.   Occidental attorney Thomas H. Truitt, at the Baltimorefirm of Piper andamp; Marbury, said the Philadelphia decisionbolsters Occidental's contention that the federal governmentshares responsibility for such dumping.   The Philadelphia case involved a rayon manufacturing plantin Front Royal, Va., that was formerly owned by FMC Corp., aChicago chemical and machinery company. FMC bought the plantin 1963 from American Viscose and sold it in 1976 to AvtexFibers-Front Royal Inc. Avtex, in turn, filed for bankruptcyprotection after the Environmental Protection Agency placedthe site on the nation's priority list of Superfund cleanupsites in 1986.   None of the owners denies that it is liable for the costof cleaning up heavy metals and other pollutants dumped atthe site. But FMC sued the Department of Commerce, thesuccessor of the War Productions Board, on grounds that theWPB shared liability. From 1942 through 1945, the boardhelped manage and control the plant to boost production ofrayon tire cord, a substitute for natural rubber.   The board oversaw a plant expansion, leased governmentequipment for construction, obtained labor, set productionspecifications and &quot;knew or should have known that thedisposal or treatment of hazardous substances was inherent&quot;in rayon production, Judge Newcomer wrote in his opinion.   It's not certain how many other Superfund sites involvecontractors that were subject to such extensive governmentmanagement. A Justice Department lawyer who argued the casesaid through a spokeswoman that he didn't know.   But because government involvement in this site was sogreat, the opinion may have a limited impact on sites notsubject to similarly stringent federal control, said FMCattorney Neil Epstein, at the Philadelphia firm of HangleyConolly Epstein Chicco Foxman andamp; Ewing.   (FMC Corp. vs. Dept. of Commerce, U.S. District Court,Philadelphia, 901761)   ---   Baker andamp; Botts, a 430-lawyer firm based in Houston, willopen a Manhattan office May 1.
