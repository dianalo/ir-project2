Lungburdens of rats exposed to charged or neutralized mineral aerosols werefound to be not significantly different, but lung burdens of rats exposedto either a toxic dust (quartz) or a relatively non-toxic dust (titaniumdioxide) scaled with respect to exposure concentration and increasedprogressively with exposure time. Lung burdens of these rats decreasedwith time post-exposure and transfer to lymph nodes appeared to commencewhen the lung burden reached a threshold which was higher (1800{mu}m)for the non-toxic dust than for the toxic dust (900{mu}m). For rats exposedto coalmine dusts collected from either an anthracite mine or one mininga low rank coal, retention post-exposure appeared to be greater for theanthracite dust with significantly faster transfer to the lymph nodesthan for the low rank dust.</TEXT></DOC>
