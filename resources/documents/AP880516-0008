It wasn't enough. But there is evidence the government's``coups'' did at least improve Chirac's losing score.   In a 48-hour span, Chirac's conservative government welcomedhome three hostages from Lebanon, attacked a rebel cave hideout inNew Caledonia to rescue 23 other hostages while killing 19separatists, and flew a French secret agent home from her PacificIsland exile.   Suddenly, people in cafes were asking if Chirac _ who had beentrailing far behind in polls _ might win after all. A previouslydespondent Chirac campaign staff regained hope.   But when the results were counted May 8, Socialist PresidentFrancois Mitterrand waltzed to re-election with 54 percent of thevote to Chirac's 46 percent.   Because French law makes it illegal to publish polls in the lastweek before an election, it is difficult to be certain what effectthe late-breaking news had on voters' decision _ beyond saying itwas not enough to sway the election.   The final public polls, taken immediately after the April 24first-round vote that eliminated all candidates except Mitterrandand Chirac, found the president leading with from 53 percent to 57percent of the vote, which was not far from the final result.   ``All these efforts concentrated miraculously in one little weekwere not enough,'' Edwy Plenel and Georges Marion commented in adouble-bylined article in the left-leaning daily Le Monde.   ``The `coups' did not pay off. At best, in a zero-sum game, theydid not change the tendency. At worst, the bloodshed obscured thelives saved and the gap was widened.''   Patrice Desaubliaux, writing in the conservative newspaper LeFigaro, came to almost the same conclusion: ``The events thatoccurred between the two rounds do not seem to have had theslightest effect.''   But there is other evidence suggesting there was at least someimpact on voters in the final days.   There were reports that the Chirac campaign's private trackingpolls showed the premier gaining more than a percentage point onMay 5 _ when news of the twin hostage liberations was published _but falling back to his previous level in the next two days.   A survey of voters as they left the polls, done for thenewspaper Le Parisien and the magazine L'Evenement du Jeudi, foundthat 8 percent of Chirac's voters made up their minds in the finaldays of the campaign, compared with just 4 percent of those whovoted for Mitterrand.   The same poll found that 13 percent of those questioned said therelease of the French hostages in Lebanon affected their vote,while 41 percent said it did not change their decision and the restwould not respond.   Among Chirac voters, the hostage release made a difference for21 percent, but it was cited by only 7 percent of those who choseMitterrand.   Similarly, the exit poll found the operation to rescue the 22police and one assistant prosecutor held captive in New Caledoniawas an element in the decision of 14 percent of all French voters.But 22 percent of Chirac's voters said the operation had an effect,compared with only 8 percent of Mitterrand supporters.   The pre-election drama began May 4, when Chirac announced to acampaign rally that the last three French hostages held by ShiiteMoslem extremists in Lebanon had just been freed.   Chirac was the first to shake the hands of magazine writerJean-Paul Kauffmann and diplomats Marcel Carton and Marcel Fontainewhen they stepped off the plane in Paris the next day.   As they were flying home, Chirac ordered an attack on Melanesianseparatists who had been holding 23 hostages in a remote islandcave. All were freed unharmed, while 19 of the New Caledoniancaptors were killed.   Then, on May 6, the government announced that Dominique Prieur,convicted of manslaughter in the sabotage of the protest shipRainbow Warrior, but considered a heroine by many in France, wasbeing flown home early from a Pacific atoll because she waspregnant.   The New Zealand government denounced Mrs. Prieur's return as aviolation of the agreement under which she had been allowed toleave prison.   All three events were credited to Chirac who, as premier,controlled the government's day-to-day business.   As president, Mitterrand's role is more detached, and he was notexpected to reap much benefit from the events, which were popularbeyond the ranks of Chirac supporters.   Mitterrand's aides said Chirac dutifully kept the presidentinformed of the government's actions in the closing days of thecampaign.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Charles Campbell is news editor in the AP Parisbureau.</TEXT></DOC>
