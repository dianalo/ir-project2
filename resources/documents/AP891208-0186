But sitting ducks can fight back,geophysicists said Friday.   As the American Geophysical Union ended its five-day fallmeeting, suggestions for reducing death and destruction fromnatural hazards included requiring tornado shelters in mobile homeparks, planning land use to avoid quake and slide damage, andsteering incoming asteroids away from Earth.   An asteroid two-thirds of a mile wide hits Earth about every300,000 years, and today it could kill more than half Earth'spopulation because of climate and direct effects of a blast equalto 7.7 million Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs, said Clark Chapman ofthe Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., and DavidMorrison, of NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View.   Conservatively assuming a 50-year human lifespan, that means anyperson has about a one-in-6,000 chance of being killed by anasteroid during their lifetime, compared with an American'sone-in-20,000 chance of dying on a plane crash or one-in-50,000chance of being killed by a tornado, said the pair, who wrote thebook ``Cosmic Catastrophes.''   ``This is, in fact, a real hazard,'' Chapman said. ``We're in ashooting gallery.''   Even a small asteroid impact ``could be mistaken for a nuclearattack,'' he said. ``It might trigger a nuclear attack.''   One asteroid passed within 500,000 miles of Earth this year,about twice the moon's distance, and a small one devastated anuninhabited part of Siberia in 1908. So it makes sense for societyto better evaluate likely consequences of a collision and usetelescopes to provide years' notice of incoming asteroids, Chapmansaid.   ``It's within our technical capabilities to design a spacemission to nudge the asteroid out of the way'' by using specialrocket engines or perhaps H-bombs, although bombs might break anasteroid into more deadly fragments, he said. ``It would be anApollo-project level of expense.''   Most scientists discussed more common natural disasters duringFriday's session.   ``It's absolutely imperative we insist mobile home parks havesecure underground shelters'' in tornado and hurricane-proneregions, said Joseph Golden, senior meterologist for the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   Golden said home designers need to pay more attention towind-resistant cladding for buildings, and build homes withinterior closets and bathrooms, which often are the only parts of ahouse left standing after a bad hurricane.   Better effort also is needed to predict hurricane tracks andintensities, and to learn if building codes are adequate fortypical wind speeds, he added.   U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist Robert Tilling said 25,000people died during the Nevado del Ruiz volcano eruption in Colombiain 1985 because local officials ignored hazard maps, signs ofimpending eruption and formal warnings by scientists.   He called for better communication between scientists andofficials, increased monitoring of volcanoes that now go unwatchedin developing nations, and improvements in predicting volcanicactivity.   Earl Brabb, a USGS geologist, said it is ``a national disgrace''that there is a lack of aerial photographs to identify areas proneto deadly landslides, which cause tens of billions of dollarsdamage globally each year.   The agency has prepared detailed landslide susceptibility mapsfor San Mateo County, south of San Francisco, and county officialsused the maps to rezone hazard areas to very low density housing,Brabb said.   The Geological Survey also operates a landslide warning systemin the Bay Area and is establishing one in Honolulu. Warnings arerelayed to the public through the Weather Service and news media.   ``If your house is adjacent to a steep slope or at the top of asteep slope, you might consider going to a motel for the weekend''after a warning, Brabb said.   Geological Survey seismologist William Ellsworth saidresearchers are getting better at making long-term forecasts ofwhich segments of faults are prone to destructive quakes.   He said emergency officials believe public safety during thedeadly Oct. 17 San Francisco Bay area quake was improved becausepeople made preparations after scientists warned in 1988 that theSan Andreas Fault was due for a jolt near the bay's south end.   Scientists need to spend more time identifying specific sitesprone to quake damage, and be more aggressive using such knowledgeto influence land-use decisions, such as construction on filledland vulnerable to intense shaking.   Mark Meier of the University of Colorado urged more detailedstudy of future sea level rises so society can ``save a lot ofmoney'' with land use planning designed to prevent damage fromstorm surges and other effects.</TEXT></DOC>
