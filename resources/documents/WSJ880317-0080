Ocelot said the sale is &quot;one important step&quot; in its efforts to return to financial health. For Toronto-based Imperial Oil, the acquisition follows December's 680 million dollar takeover of another financially troubled Canadian oil concern, Sulpetro Ltd.    Ocelot is involved in oil and gas and chemical production and oil field services such as contract drilling. It said 80 million dollars of the total selling price is dependent on future natural gas prices. It said the proceeds will be used mainly to reduce its 770 million dollars of debt.    Ocelot said its sale involves a minor volume of oil output and about 70 million cubic feet of daily natural gas output, amounting to &quot;less than half&quot; of its oil and gas assets. Ocelot's oil and gas production in British Columbia and Saskatchewan aren't affected, and it retains its exploratory properties in Alberta.    For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Ocelot had a loss of 43 million dollars, compared with a year-earlier loss of 65.4 million dollars. Revenue was 84.8 million dollars, down 27.6% from 117.1 million dollars. Results for the year aren't yet available.    Ocelot said the transaction is subject to approvals from regulatory and other authorities. A definitive purchase agreement between Ocelot and Esso Resources Canada Ltd., a unit of Imperial Oil, is expected to be completed soon, it said. An Esso Resources spokesman wasn't immediately available for comment.    Before the announcement, Ocelot's Class A stock closed yesterday at 10 dollars and the Class B stock closed at 8.625 dollars, both unchanged, on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Imperial Oil's Class A stock closed in Toronto at 56.50 dollars, down 50 cents, and the Class B stock closed at 54.25 dollars, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
