The five people, who turned in seven assault rifles, intend todonate the $2,100 they received to families of the victims in theStockton schoolyard shooting, a spokesman for the group said Friday.   ``We do not want to profiteer or benefit from their tragedy,''said Jeff Fox, spokesman for a group of Van Nuys real estate officeworkers.   Fox, 37, said the five parents were shocked by the Jan. 17shooting that killed five children and wounded 30 others, includinga teacher at Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton in northernCalifornia.   The killer, Patrick Purdy, used a semiautomatic AK-47 assaultrifle to shoot the pupils and then used a pistol to kill himself.The incident has focused attention on the destructive capabilitiesof the easily purchased weapons.   City Councilman Nate Holden, who originated the buyback idea,said a tally Friday evening showed that 42 AK-47s and two Uzimachine pistols had been turned in.   Holden, who will pay the value of the weapon up to $300, said hepaid a total of $9,841.88 for the weapons.   The Los Angeles Police Department has supported the campaignagainst the military style rifles favored by street gangs, and hashelped publicize procedures for safely bringing the weapons to itsstations.   People with police receipts showing they had returned a gun werepaid from a $50,000 political committee fund that Holden, a mayoralcandidate, set aside Tuesday.   Those who turned in weapons had a chance to pick up an additional$300 by taking a copy of the police receipt to radio station KIIS-FMin Hollywood from Thursday morning through Friday morning.   Lynn Anderson-Powell, KIIS president and general manager, saidshe didn't care if people made money off the giveaway.   ``Our purpose was to decrease the number of guns on the street.... We feel that's that many fewer lives that may be needlesslytaken in violence,'' she said.   One woman bought 13 AK-47s and turned them in Thursday, not forthe $300, but ``to get them off the shelf,'' said Holden.   Holden said the unidentified woman paid a total of $5,191.88 forthe 13 high-powered weapons, and didn't make a profit by turningthem in to authorities.   She was paid $3,900, or $300 per rifle, by KIIS-FM, and Holdensaid his office reimbursed her for the remaining amount.   Meanwhile, Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif., introducedlegislation in Congress on Friday to outlaw the possession ofsemiautomatic firearms.   Berman's bill would require civilian owners of fast-firingweapons to turn them over to a law enforcement officer within 30days after the bill takes effect. Violators would face $5,000 finesand five-year prison terms.   The National Rifle Association called Berman's plan a ``stupidpiece of legislation'' and said it would mount a strong lobbyingcampaign to defeat the bill.</TEXT></DOC>
