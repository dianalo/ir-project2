Millions of commuters had to find other ways to work and mosttook to the roads, creating huge traffic jams and frazzled nerves.   It was the fourth nationwide rail strike and the 10th strike onLondon's sprawling subway system in 11 weeks. The capital's busesoperated normally.   A dock strike for job guarantees and walkouts for higher pay bypublic service employees at city halls nationwide made things worse.   The wave of industrial strife is the worst in Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher's 10 years in power, despite tough new laws by hergovernment restricting strikes and outlawing sympathy actions.   Employment Secretary Norman Fowler hinted that new anti-strikelegislation could be introduced by the fall.   ``You don't suddenly start changing the law in that instant way,but we have been looking at the law in recent weeks,'' he said.   After a breakdown in negotiations Tuesday night, state-runBritish Rail and leaders of the three rail unions resumed talks withthe help of independent mediators. They later adjourned to let unionleaders hold private discussions.   Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the National Union ofRailwaymen, said he was not hopeful of a speedy settlement. ``Thereis a lot of work to be done,'' he said.   With annual inflation running at 8.3 percent, British Rail raisedits offer of a 7 percent increase to 8.8 percent Tuesday night, butthe unions objected to the strings attached.   British Rail wants to pay the increase only after all disputeshave ended and to replace national pay bargaining with regionalnegotiations. The unions want to make the extra pay retroactive toApril 10 and to retain national bargaining.   In the other disputes, public services operated by city hallswere paralyzed on the second day of a 48-hour pay strike by nearly500,000 employees. The strike shut libraries and local tax officesand hurt care for the handicapped and elderly.   Port employers claimed a national dock strike was cracking on itssecond day, with nearly 1,000 of the country's 9,400 registered dockworkers defying the Transport and General Workers Union by going towork.   However, the union stood by its claim that 96 percent of theworkers were on strike and had shut down major ports like Tilbury,Liverpool and Southampton.</TEXT></DOC>
