(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lobbyist for bingo and racing interestshas pleaded guilty to bribing a state legislator and relatedcharges, the first convictions in a 3-year-old investigation ofgambling-related industries.   W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker, formerly the state's chief bingoregulator, pleaded guilty Thursday in state court to bribing stateSen. Randy McNally to pass a bingo-related bill and attempting tobribe him to vote for another bill legalizing betting on horse races.   Walker also pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy, extortion, andtax charges.   Under a plea bargain, in return for his cooperation with theinvestigation and his guilty pleas Walker would face a maximumsentence of 10 years in prison and an unspecified fine. He faced upto 28 years and a $600,000 fine.   Walker was the first person to be found guilty in thefederal-state investigation dubbed ``Rocky Top,'' after a popularTennessee song. It began in 1986 with reports that bingo operatorswere paying state officials to ignore violations of laws regulatingthe industry.   ``It is a large-scale investigation,'' said U.S. Attorney JohnGill of Chattanooga. ``We do expect a significant number ofindictments and it's certainly possible that the investigation maygo into 1990.''   Prosecutors said they are are looking into allegations that otherlegislators, besides the one state senator, were bribed but wouldn'tgive details.   In his state pleas, Walker admitted twice offering bribes tostate Sen. McNally, who reported the offers to the Tennessee Bureauof Investigation and was not charged.   In the attempted bribery case, Walker admitted offering McNally$10,000 to vote for a bill to legalize pari-mutuel betting on horseracing when it moved to the Senate floor in April 1987. The billeventually passed by one vote; McNally voted against it and was notpaid.   McNally said Walker occasionally boasted of payoffs he had madeto other legislators. But McNally declined to identify those namedby Walker and said he had no other evidence other payoffs were made.   Walker faces up to 10 years on the state bribery charges.   He also pleaded guilty Thursday in Chattanooga to filing a false1985 federal income tax return that omitted payoffs from bingooperators, and to a conspiracy count that charged he knew ofwidespread illegal gambling operations.   Also Thursday, Walker pleaded guilty to an extortion charge inanother federal court, in Nashville. He was accused of accepting$15,000 from bingo operators in 1985, when he was chief bingoregulator in the secretary of state's office.   Bingo is exempt from state gambling law when operated forcharity. But The Tennessean newspaper, which has investigated theindustry, reported that only $2.6 million of the $124.7 millionraised by bingo operators in 1985-87 could be traced as having goneto charity.   No specific sentencing date was set in the Chattanooga court, butin Nashville, U.S. District Court Judge John Nixon set sentencing onthat count for April 4. He said the hearing would probably bepostponed to allow Walker to testify before grand juries.   The probe includes the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, theInternal Revenue Service and the FBI.</TEXT></DOC>
