Oleg Gordievsky, whose new book is being serialized in TheTimes, said he saw the Wallenberg file in the archives of theSoviet security agency.   Soviet officials tried to recruit Wallenberg shortly after theRed Army moved into Budapest in 1945, Gordievsky reportedly wrotein the book. When Wallenberg refused, he was taken to the SovietUnion and shot, ``not later than 1947,'' The Times reported.   The Times has been serializing Gordievsky's book, ``KGB: TheInside Story of Its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbachev,''which was coauthored by Christopher Andrew. Gordievsky's account ofWallenberg's death was not included in the excerpts but reported ina short news story in Wednesday's editions.   Soviet authorities said in 1957 that Wallenberg died in 1947 inMoscow's Lubyanka Prison. However, Wallenberg's relatives and othermembers of the Wallenberg Commission have pressed forinvestigations of reports that the diplomat was still alive.   He would be 77 today if still alive.   Members of the commission including Wallenberg's half-brother,Guy von Dardel, went to Helsinki, Finland, last month in the hopeof pressing President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev to discuss the case at their summit meeting.   Swedish authorities have relayed reports to Soviet authoritiesthat Wallenberg was seen in the 1950s and '60s, with less reliablereports of sightings continuing into the 1980s.   The commission said last month Soviet authorities never lookedinto the prison's records, although in 1957 the Soviets said theyhad examined the records.</TEXT></DOC>
