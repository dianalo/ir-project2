Izzo, vice president of A.T.andP;  Kearney, a Chicago-based managementconsulting firm.andM;Of the work that has been shifted, about 30% is being done by the softwareand 70% is being done by end users, according to Ted Klein, president of theBoston Systems Group in Boston.andP;  Tired of waiting for MIS to deliver overdueapplications requests, and frustrated with delivered products that do notmeet their needs, users have been bypassing MIS for the last several years.andO;The proliferation of easier-to-use interfaces and more powerful software nowseems to have fixed the handwriting on the wall.andP;  MIS can adapt to a new roleor lash themselves to the mainframe and wait for the heave-ho.andM;Most agree that the need for MIS is still important, but as a revampedorganization that focuses on leadership, training and strategy.andP;  Asprocessing moves from the back room to the front line, control systems arebreaking down, Izzo said, requiring new control systems.andP;  He maintained thatMIS needs to be the catalyst for this change, putting together anarchitecture that embraces the changes, deciding what decisions are safe forusers to make and offering judgments on good and bad uses of tools.andM;Is MIS taking this initiative?andP;  In most cases no, Izzo admitted.andP;  The driveis most often spearheaded by directors of business units or from afar by topmanagement.andP;  MIS' resistance to taking on the challenge reflects their fearof losing control, both of hierarchical positions and of data.andM;Mike Purcell, a software engineer for corporate information services atBaxter Healthcare Corp. in McGaw Park, Ill., said the first reaction of MISto client/server is likely to be overly conservative.andP;  &quot;It's a concern of,Let's not give users so much rope that we all hang.'&quot;  They see local-areanetworks (LANs) and client/server technology as a combination of complexityand immaturity, he said.andM;Purcell said Baxter has been using LANs as production systems for about fiveyears, but they are just starting to run a distributed operationsenvironment, shifting from character mode to GUI mode and adding databases tothe LANs.andP;  &quot;We are rolling LANs out now, but error rates are still going up,&quot;he said.andM;Numerous operating and integrity issues remain to be addressed.andP;  Purcellnoted.andP;  For instance, he asked, how do you run hybrid applications on thesame LAN?andP;  Departments that have minis and LANs and have sent their people toLAN Manager training now have the ability to run their own applications, hesaid.andP;  But the same system is also running enterprise-wide applicationssupported by the central MIS group.andM;&quot;Who owns what when the database server and communications are shared?&quot;andP;  hesaid.andP;  You could opt to keep them separate, he added, but it may not beaffordable.andM;This shift of control from MIS to power users in business units has cutapplication development time, but it often means economies of scale are lost,and security, compatibility and standard procedure issues are overlooked.andM;&quot;It's impossible to stop it,&quot; said Izzo of end-user application development.andO;He added that if central IS is spending $15 million a year, user groupsthroughout the organization are probably spending between $8 million and $ 10million.andP;  What is necessary to recognize and take advantage of this shift,said Izzo and others, is a revamped MIS] organization that acts as architectand facilitator rather than as doer and dictator.andM;&quot;IS is living in the past,&quot; he said, while technology has changeddramatically around them.andP;  BSG's Papermaster agreed that MIS needs to bereorganized--starting with the reporting structure.andM;REPORTING STRUCTURE OUTDATEDandM;Traditionally, he said, MIS reports to the CFO, who puts a heavy emphasis onaccounting and finance and tends to hold a conservative, centralized view ofoperations.andP;  Instead, MIS should report to the CEO or COO, so that itsstrategic direction parallels the strategic direction of the organization,Papermaster said.andP;  MIS should be proactive instead of reactive and help usersfind the right resources.andM;This is one reason for MIS' resistance; they often do not have the skills toprovide the new services--GUI development, support for PCs, local-areanetworks (LANs) and wide-area networks (WANs)--and the people skillsnecessary for increased interaction with users.andM;Papermaster stressed that Cobol programming is very different than GUIdevelopment, where there are overlapping windows and data entry objects.andP;  Theprogrammer/developer must be in much closer contact with users.andM;&quot;Client/server computing brings work closer to the user,&quot; said Papermaster,which is often hard for traditional MIS staff.andP;  &quot;Those that don't interactwon't be around for long,&quot; he warned.andP;  There are also not enough GUIdesigners out there, he said, so companies are training those willing tolearn.andP;  He suggested it is easier and safer to take an open-minded MISdeveloper who understands data modeling, data integrity and database designand train them in GUi development, than to take a PC hacker and try to givethem the necessary systems background.andM;Most agree the need for Cobol programmers will not go away, but the pace ofgrowth in the field has slowed.andM;The fundamental shift to client/server will produce more work than MIS canhandle, Papermaster said, but they need to step in and say, &quot;We'll helpmediate which tools to use and facilitate their use.&quot;andM;In the meantime, miniature MIS shops are materializing in end-user groups, amix of new hires from outside, user-friendly MIS staff who have been luredaway from the central group and, more often than not, power or techie userswho have informally been handling systems support or applications developmenton an ad hoc basis.andM;In addition to applications developers, the move to client/server systemsalmost always calls for a network administrator or workstation coordinator tohandle LAN support, new software releases and problems with distribution.andO;Some companies are handling network support by outsouring; others are formingMIS/user groups to establish and monitor LAN standards.andM;&quot;This is as much a validation of an informal skill set as the creation of anew position,&quot; said David Connor, vice president of Cambridge, Mass.-basedLotus Development Corp.'s Consulting Services Group.andP;  Companies are startingto impose formal training on particular skill sets that have been held bypower users, he said, and &quot;job descriptions will develop around those roles.&quot;andM;This is the case at Baxter Healthcare, where network administration is doneby a key contact in the user department.andP;  It is also the case at the HumanServices Agency of Merced County, in Merced, Calif., which issues benefitsfor Families with Dependent Children, food stamps and Medicaid.andP;  The agency,with help from Andersen Consulting, has developed an expert system,workstation-based welfare system, called Magic, that will be a proto-type formajor assistance programs throughout the state.andM;The agency began the pilot in August 1990, and by October 1, they expect tohave all public assistance cases converted.andP;  Approximately 15,000 familieswill receive public assistance through the Magic system, according to JohnCullen, director of the agency.andP;  About 70% of the typical mainframeprocessing used for case management functions has been offloaded from themainframe to the 386-based workstations, he said.andP;  They will have about 250workstations when the cutover is complete.andM;Since the new system was installed, the agency has added two people to handleLAN support--previously general analysts with a welfare perspective.andP;  Theagency sent them to LAN Manager training and expert system training andreclassified them as DP analysts.andP;  Two additional people from the user sidewere added to form a help desk.andP;  &quot;These people work on the floor with familyassitance reps to help troubleshoot or give one-on-one training,&quot; Cullensaid.andM;Position changes did not stop there.andP;  MIS hired four fulltime people asprogrammers and systems analysts to handle continuing and new systemsdevelopment.andP;  As for case management, the workers who processed cases used tobe called eligibility workers, positions that were considered modifiedclerical work.andP;  Now that they are being asked to navigate through the Magicsystem in all three of the agency's areas--Aid to Families with DependentChildren (AFDC), Medicaid and food stamps--they have been trained andreclassified as family assistance reps.andM;&quot;This gives everyone a better understanding and expectation of what theposition entails,&quot; Cullen said.andP;  The new system lets a family deal with oneperson instead of three to handle their account, and has cut three visits toone and approximately five hours of processing time to two hours.andP;  Benefitsthat used to take a week to be issued can now be issued in a day.andM;Those workers involved in enterprise-wide moves to client/server could notstress enough the importance of top management support for the process.andM;&quot;It's the most important element if you are instituting major,across-the-board changes,&quot; Papermaster said.andP;  They do not need to becompletely involved, he added, but they have to be committed, and the morevocal and participatory they are, the better.andP;  Others acknowledged thathigh-level support is not necessary if the goal is simply to meet end-userrequirements and provide off-the-shelf tools with limited file sharing.andM;Merced County's Cullen said last year's No.andP;  1 agency priority was thedevelopment of Magic and this year's No.andP;  1 priority is its installment.andO;&quot;Top to bottom, everyone needs to be committed,&quot; Cullen said.andM;Simple support is not enough, though, according to Sid Adelman, seniorconsultant in the Finance Industry and Services Consulting Group for IBM inLos Angeles.andP;  Top management needs to understand why moving to client/serveris important and have a means of measuring success.andP;  &quot;Most companies don'thave good measurement systems in place,&quot; Adelman said.andP;  The old systems andthe old market order prompted questions like, &quot;'Is it on time?' and 'Is it onbudget?'&quot;  The new systems are more complex and so are the questions, Adelmansaid.andP;  &quot;How fragile is the system?andP;  How expandable?andP;  Does it meet thestrategic needs of the business?andP;  Will it in five years?&quot;andM;Hard questions need to be asked about personnel as well--Who can be trainedto do this job?andP;  Who is unwilling to accept change?andP;  How do you rewardpeople?andM;&quot;If the compensation system is based on the number of people working for you,you have to change that,&quot; said Jay Stright, manager of employee systems forChevron in San Ramon, Calif.andP;  With decentralized systems, it is no longer avalid measure.andM;ROLE OF TRAINING GROWINGandM;Training is the other element seen as absolutely vital to the effective useof client/server systems.andP;  It will play a dramatically increasing role in theorganization as major corporations put their mission-critical programs onclient/server systems, thereby requiring more formalized skills andprocedures, said Lotus' Connor.andM;&quot;It takes more than saying.andP;  'This is your new job description,'&quot; saidStright.andP;  &quot;Changing skills sets takes time.&quot;andP;  Chevron implemented the firstphase of its client/server system in 1989, and it did not go as well as itshould have, he said.andP;  &quot;When you introduce a new technology into businesstoday, it's like throwing bricks into a rushing river.&quot;andM;Chevron's benefits administrators can now navigate through the systemthemselves, allowing the agency to be much more responsive, but he noted thatthe training process took several years for them to fully understand thesystems.andP;  &quot;Those changes don't happen overnight; it takes years to optimizethe use of the client/server architecture,&quot; Stright said.andM;&quot;You are reengineering people's heads, and it should be done in aproactive--not reactive--way,&quot; said Papermaster.andP;  He added that it shouldbegin top down with education about the process, then move on to coverdevelopment skills, network design, programming, methodologies and so on.andM;Training is taking place both internally and externally, but Papermastermaintains it is almost always more effectively done outside because employeestend to listen to outsiders more.andP;  Other consultants agreed that training isbecoming a major outsourcing issue, and if done internally may call for a newtraining group.andP;  It is also important for management to voice why thetraining is important to people's jobs, said IBM's Adelman.andP;  &quot;Too often,employees don't really know why they're there,&quot; he said, and the opportunityfor learning is wasted.andM;Users and consultants agreed that to facilitate the transition toclient/server, you must accept that changes take time, often years, andexamine how your organizational structure works with or against thetechnology.andM;&quot;If you don't understand that you're impacting the organization, you'll be introuble,&quot; Stright said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
