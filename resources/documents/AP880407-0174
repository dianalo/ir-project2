Kirk Jr.on Thursday added his voice to that of New York Gov. Mario Cuomo insuggesting that presidential hopeful Albert Gore Jr. tone down hisnegative campaigning.   Kirk said that Cuomo's suggestions that the Tennessee senatorrefrain from further attacks on Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis``are helpful and are on course as far as I'm concerned.''   The party chief also said Sen. Paul Simon's decision to suspendcampaigning made the remaining Democratic contests all the moredecisive.   ``The process is doing what it was designed to do: narrow thefield and pull from the field the strongest possible contender,''he told a news conference.   Asked whether he thought Gore would have to quit if he doespoorly in the April 19 primary in New York, Kirk said he did notwish to ``prejudge the results.''   On the subject of Gore's attacks on his rivals, Kirk said, ``Ispoke a year ago about the importance of resolving to keep thedebate and the dialogue positive and not involved in any negativecampaigning.''   ``For the most part, we've been quite successful in that regard.The admonitions that have been addressed to Sen. Gore by Gov. Cuomojust help to make sure we can continue to talk about the issues ina positive way.''   On whether Cuomo himself might become the nominee in a brokeredconvention, Kirk insisted the Democratic nominee would be chosenfrom among the candidates now running.   ``There is a game going on on the field. That's where thenominee's going to be chosen from,'' he said.   Meanwhile, Kirk said that Jackson would have ``significantrepresentation'' on the party's platform committee, regardless ofwho eventually becomes the nominee.   He disputed a reporter's suggestion that Jackson's influencemight result in a more liberal platform than would otherwise beproduced.   ``The fact that Jesse Jackson is running and doing well is animportant constructive force within the Democratic party and shouldnot be looked upon as an overwhelming problem,'' Kirk said.   At the same time, he appeared to temper slightly his earlierassertion that the party's 1988 platform be kept sparse and bland,saying the party would not ``sound a retreat from'' issues it hadchampioned in the past, including the Equal Rights Amendment andabortion rights.   Asked specifically about abortion, Kirk said, ``I think ourparty has always embraced the rights of privacy, the rights ofindividual choice.''   However, Kirk suggested that the platform would address theseissues in a way that would not be divisive and which would giveDemocratic candidates a document ``to run with and not shy awayfrom.''   Although Kirk's suggestion last December that the party platformbe kept vague won the support of other Democratic leaders and theAFL-CIO, it was criticized by a variety of interest organizations.   Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard, chairman of the platform committee,said that state and regional hearings will be held on the platformin the coming months. However, Blanchard said he would not permitthe platform hearings to turn into an ideological battleground.   ``I'd like to think that someone will read it other thanopponents. I hate to work on something that will collect dust,''Blanchard said.</TEXT></DOC>
