Authorities did not give details of the predawn arrest of JuanRamon Matta, 43. He has lived openly in Honduras since escaping in1986 from a Colombian prison, where he was held on charges ofinvolvement with the notorious Medellin drug cartel.   ``This arrest is a major milestone in our worldwide assault onillegal drug trafficking,'' said Stanley E. Morris, director of theU.S. Marshals Service in Washington.   Honduran government sources said privately that President JoseAzcona Hoyo met with top civilian and security officials to discussthe case of Matta, who is wanted in the United States on drugcharges.   The U.S. Marshals Service announced in Washington late Tuesdaythat Matta had been taken into U.S. custody.   Spokesman Stephen Boyle said Matta was at an undisclosedlocation ``in U.S. jurisdiction'' and would be taken to a federalprison in the United States ``before dawn (Wednesday).''   Morris said Matta ``was placed on a commercial airliner destinedfor the United States at approximately 7 p.m. EDT.''   A U.S. law enforcement source, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said authorities also want to question him about thedeath of Enrique Camarena Salazar, a U.S. Drug EnforcementAdministration agent who was kidnapped, tortured and killed inGuadalajara, Mexico, in 1985.   The Marshals Service said Matta is believed to have become aleader of a group of traffickers that controlled the flow ofillegal drugs from Mexico.   Carlos Lorenzana, Matta's lawyer, said in a telephone interviewabout 60 heavily armed policemen using helicopters arrived at hisclient's home at 5:45 a.m.   He claimed Matta, as a Honduran citizen, could not be extraditedto the United States ``because the constitution forbids it.''   Asked later Tuesday about Matta being in U.S. custody, thelawyer said: ``I don't know anything yet, but if Matta is found inthe United States that's a kidnapping, not an extradition, becausehe is a Honduran and protected by the political constitution.''   A source at the U.S. Embassy, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said extradition was legal and ``our governmentmaintains its position of taking Matta to our country, where hewill face trial in five courts for drug trafficking.''   Lorenzana said Matta was taken to a special police facility atLa Venta, 12 miles east of the capital.   U.S. authorities link Matta's return to Honduras to an increasein transshipment of Colombian cocaine through this Central Americancountry.   Allegations have been made of involvement by top Honduranmilitary officials.   The government denied the reports in February. Azcona saidcritics were trying ``to discredit the armed forces and mygovernment, which has taken a series of actions to combat the drugtraffickers.''   Matta told The Associated Press in February he makes his livingin cattle ranching, construction and the tobacco, spice and coffeetrade. His wealth has been estimated at up to $2 billion, but heputs it at about $5 million.   He said the charges against him were ``a lie, a story,'' andclaimed U.S. agents tried three times in the past year to kidnaphim.   Matta said then he never again would leave Honduras. ``If Iappear in the United States, it is a kidnapping by American agents.If I am killed, it is the DEA,'' he said at the time.   It apppeared that after fleeing Colombia he went to theDominican Republic but was expelled after officials determined hewas wanted in the United States.   The Marshals Service said this expulsion was based on a U.S.warrant for Matta after he escaped from Elgin Federal Prison Campin Florida in 1971. He was serving a five-year sentence forillegally entering the United States and using a fraudulent visa.   Warrants charge him with escape from federal custody, conspiracyto smuggle cocaine, possession with intent to distribute coccaine,engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and other charges.</TEXT></DOC>
