(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The governor has rejected a request toreduce the prison sentence of a killer who left death row to becomea model inmate and a nationally recognized prison journalist.   Wilbert Rideau, who is serving a life sentence, was originallysentenced to death for a 1961 bank robbery in which he kidnappedthree employees, shot and wounded two of them and killed the thirdby slitting her throat.   Although Rideau, 47, has been praised by prison officials for hisbehavior behind bars, his previous bids for a reduced sentence havebeen rejected because of strong opposition from Calcasieu Parish lawenforcement officials and the victims.   Gov. Buddy Roemer cited the same reasons in issuing his decisionWednesday.   ``Given the horrible nature of this crime, the fact that bothsurviving victims oppose clemency and the fact that Calcasieu lawenforcement officials oppose clemency, I deny Rideau's plea for areduced sentence,'' Roemer said.   A reduced sentence would have made Rideau eligible for parole.   Rideau was arrested shortly after the robbery and murder andconfessed in front of television cameras. He spent 10 years on deathrow until the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state's capitalpunishment law in 1972.   With his sentence commuted to life in prison, he became the firstblack to gain a position on the prison magazine, the Angolite, andis now editor.   Rideau has said his journalism is proof of his rehabilitation.   He is one of the most visible inmates at the Lousisiana StatePentitentiary at Angola, frequently appearing on national televisionshows. He and other editors have been singled out for nationalrecognition by organizations ranging from private foundations to theAmerican Bar Association.</TEXT></DOC>
