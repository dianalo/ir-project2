Times.andP;  &quot;Networking requiresEthernet or better -- FDDI.andP;  I'd really like FDDI over twisted-pair[cabling].&quot;andM;Several network suppliers are racing to develop products that will do justthat: send 100-Mbps FDDI signals over twisted-pair cabling.andM;SynOptics Communications Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., and Cabletron SystemsInc. of Rochester, N.H., are among several vendors working with the AmericanNational Standards Institute on a standard for FDDI on twisted-pair cabling.andM;Designed as a fiber-optic networking protocol, FDDI -- on either fiber-opticor twisted-pair cable -- is at least 10 times faster than Ethernet.andP;  Becauseof its high speed, FDDI is seen as a promising technology for networkbackbones, routers and bridges.andP;  But the target distance set by the ANSIcommittee for FDDI on twisted-pair cabling is only 90 meters.andM;Some analysts predict that FDDI will be driven to the desktop by trends suchas client/server computing and high-performance graphics workstations.andP;  TheU.S.andP;  market for fiber-optic nodes will grow from 3,000 in 1990 to more than300,000 in 1994, according to Forrester Research Inc., a Cambridge,Mass.-based research company.andM;However, FDDI is an expensive option.andP;  The average cost for FDDI, includingfiber-optic adapters, hubs, cables and connectors is $11,650 per port,according to Forrester.andM;&quot;I expect the cost of twisted-pair FDDI will be 40 percent less than thefiber-optic alternative,&quot; said Nick Schommer, FDDI product marketing managerfor SynOptics.andM;Although the recently formed ANSI committee handling the subject has barelybegun its work, SynOptics demonstrated its version of FDDI over IBM Type 1shielded twisted-pair cabling at the InterOp networking show in San Jose,Calif., last month.andP;  The company has licensed its FDDI technology to fouradapter-card vendors that plan to ship products in the first quarter of 1991,when SynOptics is scheduled to ship FDDI interfaces to its System 3000intelligent wiring center.andM;Cabletron, as well as Santa Clara, Calif.-based National Semiconductor Corp.,andO;announced last month that it is working on an FDDI transceiver for shieldedtwisted-pair cable to be available in 1991.andP;  Cabletron, however, is notannouncing plans for FDDI products on unshielded twisted-pair cabling becausethe ANSI committee has not decided if it is feasible over the 90-meterminimum distance.andP;  In addition, it may be two years before any copper-basedFDDI standard is settled, according to Chris Oliver, director of engineeringand manufacturing at Cabletron.andM;&quot;Unshielded twisted-pair is harder to drive a great distance because ofcross-talk and other technical problems,&quot; Oliver said.andP;  &quot;It will take morework to develop [FDDI] for unshielded.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
