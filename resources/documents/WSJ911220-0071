The apparelchain was virtually the sine qua non of upscale career women,and no lesser establishments than Bloomingdale's and SaksFifth Avenue were next in line on his acquisition list.   Mr. Brooks had impressive credentials. A demandingperfectionist, he had risen by 1975 to the top spot at Lord andamp;Taylor, the flagship chain of Associated Dry Goods Corp. Witha flair for the sizzle side of marketing, and an ability tolog long, intense days, he could boast to financial backersthat &quot;nobody has ever lost money investing in me.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But when Mr. Brooks went to AnnTaylor in order to run hisown show free of corporate control, one fervently sought goalstill eluded the multimillionaire: success for his only son,Thomas. Thomas Brooks, a music major who had dropped out ofcollege and had a weight problem, was well enough liked, buthe was low-key and lacking his father's intense drive. Thesenior Mr. Brooks -- single-minded on this issue as on everyother -- soon sought to remedy the situation by forcing hisson's promotion to president of the newly acquired apparelchain.   Less than three years later, 38-year-old Thomas Brooks isout of a job, and his 64-year-old father soon will be. Thedream of a family retail dynasty lies in tatters followingthe son's embarrassing brush with the U.S. Customs Servicefor trying to spirit a handful of expensive watches into thecountry. Meanwhile, AnnTaylor's sales lately have beensinking rapidly; sales at company-owned stores open a year ormore were off 10.3% in November.   And another ambitious father has learned a hard but notuncommon lesson: When the son is pushed forward too fast incorporate America, trouble often follows.   Many corporate chief executives do yearn for theirchildren to succeed them. But &quot;all the typical problems youhave with succession planning are magnified&quot; when a child isthe heir apparent, says Dee Soder, a psychologist whosepractice includes 20 CEOs. If a son doesn't excel, the fatherfeels he has failed &quot;not only as a boss . . . but as afather.&quot;   But while many corporate offspring fail to fulfill theirfather's lofty hopes, rarely does a corporate chieftain'sdream of succession end with the dramatic down-fall of bothfather and son.   Joseph Brooks impressed the retail industry at the helm ofLord andamp; Taylor from 1975 until early 1987. (He left after itsacquisition by May Department Stores Co. dashed his hopes ofbecoming parent-company CEO.) During his tenure he restoredLord andamp; Taylor's glamour and quadrupled its revenue. He stagedlavish charity events and installed bevelled mirrors on the20-foot columns of the Fifth Avenue store. And a veteranbuyer says Mr. Brooks would even remind lingerie staffers&quot;that we always should carry black strapless bras&quot; to promotethe chain's classy evening-wear image.   But his frustration on a personal level was building.Though his son had joined Lord andamp; Taylor in 1985, Thomas heldonly a variety of low and midlevel management jobs.   Things changed quickly when the senior Mr. Brooksspearheaded a leveraged buyout of Campeau Corp.'s AnnTaylor,then a 119-store chain with annual sales of $274 million. Mr.Brooks never owned more than 4% of the shares -- MerrillLynch held most of the rest, and currently holds some 56%.But he was chairman and chief executive, and &quot;he felt like itwas his company,&quot; says Harold Leppo, who had been his secondin command at Lord andamp; Taylor.   Mr. Brooks quickly moved AnnTaylor's executive officesfrom the main Manhattan store to luxurious quarters twice aslarge in a nearby skyscraper, where he liked to show off hisblack marble bathroom. When he traveled short distances,suppliers say, he rode in a stretch limousine.   He readied bids for other store chains and envisionedcreating a retail holding company. AnnTaylor had 12 vicepresidents when he arrived. He jumped the number to 44, manyfrom Lord andamp; Taylor. One was his son, Thomas.   Then seven months after the leveraged buy-out, Mr. Brooksfired AnnTaylor's No. 2 executive, Michele Fortune. There hadbeen months of conflict over matters such as personnel, and&quot;one day he said, `Don't come to work tomorrow,'&quot; says Ms.Fortune, now an executive at TJX Cos. &quot;I was just in theway.&quot;   Mr. Brooks's new choice for president and chief operatingofficer? His son, Thomas. The chain's three directors fromMerrill Lynch objected that the 38-year-old had scantexperience. Although Thomas had held retailing jobs for abouta decade, the highest level he'd reached was a regional vicepresident for Lord andamp; Taylor while his father was at its helm.But after months of debate they relented, figuring the seniorMr. Brooks would be making all the decisions anyway.   Publicly, the son displayed the role of hands-on heirapparent, telling an interviewer in early 1990 he had justbeen in Hong Kong &quot;putting the fall season together.&quot; Infact, he merely greeted suppliers and &quot;then would disappear,&quot;says a former AnnTaylor executive who was on the trip, JeanGilbert. She adds that he had just lost weight, and &quot;spentmost of the trip going for fittings on his suits.&quot; (Like hisfather, Thomas Brooks declined several requests for aninterview.)   Joseph Brooks also portrayed Thomas as playing animportant role, but it wasn't easy to escape the father'slarge shadow. When both men attended a lunch for investors atBoston's Harbor Hotel, Thomas sat away from the head tableand made no public remarks. Company presidents typically siton the dais at such functions, &quot;except when you have a verydominant father&quot; as chairman, says Janet Kloppenburg, aretail analyst for Robertson Stephens andamp; Co. Stephens acted asco-manager when those who led the AnnTaylor LBO brought thecompany public in an initial stock offering last May.   As a public company, AnnTaylor has had its ups and downs,as the stock's course indicates. The shares jumped from $26to $36 by July, but swooned to a low of $12 last month aftersales dropped in late summer. They closed at $13.25 on theNew York Stock Exchange yesterday, down 25 cents. Industryanalysts partly cite the recession for the stores' salesdrop. But they also blame Joseph Brooks's strategy of holdingprices steady by allowing the use of cheaper materials.   Joseph's aspirations for his son began to unravel onSunday, Oct. 6. Customs inspectors at John F. Kennedy Airportstopped Thomas and an AnnTaylor clothing supplier as theyreturned from a business trip to Asia and Europe. Thomas wasdetained for trying to avoid duties on about a half-dozenwristwatches worth between $125,000 and $140,000, apparentlyto add to a collection he keeps as a hobby. His attorneys andCustoms officials are still discussing a proposed civilpenalty. It could be as high as $125,000 because in March1984 he had had a similar Customs run-in. At that time hepaid a $1,669 penalty for neglecting to declare $6,982 worthof goods at Los Angeles International Airport, according toCustoms documents -- a fact his father's confidants believethe son kept secret from him.   News of the JFK incident didn't sit well with AnnTaylor'sthree board members from Merrill Lynch. They held a specialSaturday meeting by telephone with Joseph and Thomas, the twoother directors.   &quot;One of the Merrill Lynch people said {to him}, `Thiscalls into question your integrity,'&quot; says Joseph J. Schumm,an AnnTaylor executive vice president who took part in thecall. Merrill Lynch directors demanded a probe by AnnTaylor'soutside counsel &quot;to make sure there were no improprieties ofany kind&quot; involving the chain in the JFK incident, Mr. Schummadds.   The young AnnTaylor president, who earned $390,000 insalary and bonus last year, clearly had lost Merrill Lynch'sconfidence. He believed that he should quit immediately overwhat he told his father was a stupid act, acquaintances say.But, they add, his father disagreed. That Saturday night andmuch of Sunday, Joseph argued with his son over the issue.   &quot;Tom was saying, `I'm going to resign,'&quot; a friend of hissays. &quot;Joe kept saying, `Think it over. Think it over.'&quot;Joseph is said to have felt that a stupid personal mistakeshouldn't jeopardize his son's rapid professionaladvancement. But in defiance of his father, Thomas submittedhis resignation.   On Monday, Oct. 14, AnnTaylor tersely announced that its38-year-old president and chief operating officer wouldresign Nov. 15 to &quot;pursue other interests.&quot; No successor wasnamed. Thomas now is unemployed.   Joseph Brooks took it hard. His calls every other day toMerrill Lynch directors about corporate matters tailed offdramatically. His daily barrage of marching orders to staffmembers -- often waking them at 6:30 a.m. -- also dried up.On some days, he seemed to talk about only one subject: hisson.   Meanwhile, the business was deteriorating. Unable to shakehis doldrums, colleagues recall, Mr. Brooks repeatedly askedhimself aloud: &quot;Why did this happen? Who did this to my son?&quot;   Merrill Lynch directors saw a changed man when they metOct. 23 to hear a report from Skadden Arps Slate Meagher andamp;Flom. The outside law firm concluded that the JFK incidentdidn't involve any AnnTaylor merchandise, but did find minordiscrepancies in Thomas's expense accounts. The elder Mr.Brooks became emotional, visibly distraught over his son'sdeparture. He was so overcome, he didn't object when MerrillLynch directors proposed tapping as president a strongoutsider who might become chief executive within two years.The board quickly hired an executive recruiter.   Over the next two weeks, Joseph Brooks occasionally seemedhis old self, summoning managers and making presentations toinvestors. Trying to revive Wall Street's flagging interest,he told a group of institutional investors that he had madesome merchandising mistakes and said that his son chose toresign rather than embarrass the company. The senior Mr.Brooks &quot;was more down to earth and humble&quot; than usual, saysJeffrey Edelman, a retailing analyst at C.J. Lawrence Inc.   By early November, Merrill Lynch directors were growingincreasingly worried about the deterioration in AnnTaylor'ssales and their leader's ability to keep running the show.Then came another blow: Headhunters said the best candidatesfor president were people who would spurn an heir-apparentpost and insist on becoming chief executive right away. &quot;Joeis such an intense, driven man that a number of peoplewouldn't consider&quot; playing second fiddle to him, says Mr.Schumm, the executive vice president.   So, through a go-between, the directors informed Mr.Brooks that his son's expected replacement instead wouldbegin as chief executive -- and that he, as incumbent CEO,would have to retire from all of his posts with the companywhen the outsider arrived. &quot;This is a great company. . . . Wewant the strongest possible successor {to Joseph Brooks} thatwe can attract,&quot; explains Gerald S. Armstrong, an AnnTaylordirector and an executive vice president of Merrill LynchCapital Partners Inc., which handled the LBO.   Gloom evidently turned to near-despair for Mr. Brooks.&quot;The finality finally hit him&quot; once he realized that MerrillLynch was ousting him, a colleague says. One day, hedismissed some people from his office. Then he broke down andcried.   The sadness contrasted vividly with the driving ambitionthat had characterized Mr. Brooks's long career andcontributed to his lofty goals for his son. Even in highschool in Philadelphia, he showed panache. &quot;Joe was alwaysthe epitome of fashion,&quot; wearing navy blazers, button-downshirts and gray flannel pants, remembers Albert Nipon, aformer classmate and a Leslie Fay Cos. executive.   Throughout his career, his empathy for subordinates'personal troubles made many intensely loyal. A receivingclerk in Lord andamp; Taylor's basement once confided to Mr. Brooksthat a relative was dying of cancer. Without the knowledge ofthe clerk, who was a Roman Catholic, &quot;he called CardinalO'Connor and had a mass said for her family at St. Patrick'sCathedral,&quot; says Brendan Fahy, the clerk's former supervisor.&quot;That made her whole life.&quot;   But Mr. Brooks's ego and domineering style irritatedothers. &quot;If you were in his office and you touched his desk,he screamed at you for leaving fingerprints,&quot; recalls Ms.Gilbert, the ex-AnnTaylor executive. &quot;The business was hislife,&quot; Mr. Leppo says.   That life, at least at AnnTaylor, now seems over. On Nov.13, AnnTaylor made its second somber and unexpectedannouncement in less than a month: Joseph Brooks would leavesometime next year after the appointment of his successor.Remnants of his hoped-for dynasty remain: Two daughters stillhold lower-level executive jobs at AnnTaylor.   The chairman, who was paid nearly $2 million a year,stopped coming to work early this month, and an operatingcommittee of five top executives took over. When Mr. Brooksleft, he took along 30 photographs of himself posing orshaking hands with celebrities. The pictures used to blankettwo walls of his office. Last Friday, a workman wasrepainting the walls to cover the holes.   &quot;He acted as a caring father, but not as a CEO,&quot; is howMr. Schumm, the AnnTaylor executive vice president, sums upthe sad affair. &quot;That's the danger of nepotism.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
