(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Texaco Inc. has asked a federalbankruptcy judge to authorize a credit agreement allowing thecompany to borrow up to $3 billion to finance its reorganizationplan.   The $3 billion is a vital part of the giant oil company's effortto extricate itself from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and would be one ofthe largest amounts ever made to a company emerging from thatprocess.   Texaco sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 lastyear to avoid liens stemming from a $10.3 billion award grantedrival Pennzoil after a Texas jury found Texaco had illegallyderailed Pennzoil's takeover of Getty Oil Co.   After months of failed appeals and negotiations, areorganization plan was reached with Texaco under which Pennzoilwould get a cash settlement of $3 billion.   In a financial disclosure statement filed earlier this year,Texaco told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Schwartzberg it would need$5.6 billion to fund the reorganization plan, of which $2.4 billionwould be cash on hand and $3.2 billion would be borrowed.   According to papers filed in bankruptcy court Tuesday, 20 to 30banks were involved in the negotiations for the loans.   The loans would be made to Texaco, Texaco Refining and MarketingInc. and Texaco Overseas Holding Inc. and would be secured bycollateral.   The papers said that the collateral could include the stock ofTexas Caltex Petroleum, Texaco CAnada, Deutsche Texaco AG, reservesof oil and gas or other assets.   The debt would be repaid within three years, with an initial$1.5 billion payment occuring within 12 months, $500 millionpayment on the second anniversary and the rest paid the followingyear.   If approved, the plan would become effect April 14.   The rate of interest would decline as Texaco's credit ratingimproved, the papers said.   A hearing on the matter was set for March 22.</TEXT></DOC>
