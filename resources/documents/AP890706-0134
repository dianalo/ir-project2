Q: Yes, Mr. President, despite your recent success at the NATOsummit, Mr. Gorbachev seems to have enjoyed far greater popularityin Western Europe than you do. Why do you think that is, and whatcan you do about it?   Bush: You know something? I don't really care about that. I'm notinterested in that. I am delighted that he enjoys popularity inEurope. I am delighted when he goes to Germany. I am pleased when hegoes to France. It is good for world peace that he takes thosetrips, and I expect he will be delighted when I go to Poland andwhen I go to Hungary, for we will be well received in thosecountries. So we shouldn't view the relationships between East andWest, or between the United States and the Soviet Union on who seemsto be popular at the moment. We're not going to get into theinternational poll business _ even though I read with keen interesta recent poll taken by the US Information Agency or somebody of thatnature pointing out that the standing of the United States _ I'lltry to be modest _ was pretty darn good in Europe following the NATOsummit. But I would make a tremendous mistake as president of theUnited States if I was concerned about Mr. Gorbachev's popularityvis-a-vis my own in terms of some poll. It's irrelevant. What'simportant is how are we going to handle these major questions thatwe're asked here _ arms control, or economic recovery, and freedomand democracy in Eastern Europe? These are the questions.   And I might add parenthetically, you mentioned those figures, orstandings _ I don't know whether you're accurate or not _ but evenif they are, it doesn't mean I ought to go to Eastern Europe to tryto go one up, try to establish a popularity level in Poland orHungary. That's not what sound foreign policy is about. We want tosee these countries in Eastern Europe move more down the road towarddemocracy, down the road toward freedom. And so, I have to resistgetting into _ into this popularity thing, other than to say I'mpleased, and I mean it. I am very pleased that his standing is goodin Europe, because that enables us then, to work not onlybilaterally, but through NATO and the Pact to improve things for thepeople. So it doesn't really concern me.   Q: Mr. President, Solidarity has asked for Western aid of some$10 billion over three years to fend off what they call ``economicdisaster.'' Is there any realistic propect of the Paris summitcoming up with that kind of sum from the West?   Bush: I do not want to go into sums, but I doubt that there willbe an instant grant of any $10 billion. But the summit, the G-7,will be addressing itself, themselves, to this concept of what do wedo to help economic recovery? But I said, in these countries, as Isaid in my opening statement, though, I think there is a _ must be a_ recognition on the part of the Solidarnosc leaders and the part ofthe government leaders from all stripes in Poland, that economicreform is essential if the West, through multilateral institutionsor bilaterally, can do its, do its upmost. The economic reform isessential if we're going to be able to help the way we'd like. But Ihaven't heard the $10 billion figure that, from Solidarnosc, but Idon't want to raise expectations by saying I think we can achievesuch a number, something of that nature.   Q: May I follow up?   Bush: Please.   MORE</TEXT></DOC>
