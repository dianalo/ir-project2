Prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange collapsed as aresult of the move by Canadian officials.</LP><TEXT>   The Canadian announcement, which provoked protests fromthe U.S. lumber industry and from U.S. congressmen, threatensto rekindle a 1980s' lumber trade quarrel.   &quot;The United States can't afford to let this action by theCanadians go unanswered,&quot; said Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.).&quot;The United States must take action under U.S. trade laws tolet the Canadians know we won't sit idly by as they back outof the softwood lumber agreement.&quot;   The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in Washingtonsaid it regretted Canada's decision to terminate theagreement, officially known as a memorandum of understanding.&quot;We will urgently review the situation,&quot; the office said. &quot;Inconsultation with Congress and our industry, we will beconsidering all options, including imposition of a U.S.import tax, if appropriate, to offset any existingsubsidies.&quot;   Canada entered into the agreement to prevent the U.S. fromimposing what was expected to be a stiff countervailing dutyon imports of Canadian lumber. The U.S. lumber industrycontended that such a levy was warranted by the practice ofCanadian provinces of selling timber to Canadian lumbercompanies at below-market administered prices. Canadianprovinces own more than 90% of Canadian timber.   The U.S.-Canada agreement initially imposed a 15% levy onCanadian lumber exports to the U.S. to offset the timberprice advantage of Canadian lumber producers. With U.S.consent, the levy has been eliminated on most Canadian lumberexports to the U.S. as a result of increases in the timbercharges of major lumber producing provinces, includingBritish Columbia.   Canadian Trade Minister Michael Wilson said the lumbertrade agreement &quot;has served its purpose and the time has comefor Canada to exercise its right of termination.&quot; Thetermination is to take effect Oct. 4. On that day, Canadawill stop collecting any export tax on lumber exports to theU.S. The tax currently generates about 40 million Canadiandollars annually (US$35 million), down from C$400 million in1987 when all lumber exports were subject to the levy.   Mike Apsey, president of the Council of Forest Industriesof British Columbia, said that since the agreement was signedin 1986, timber costs and other charges &quot;have increaseddramatically for our producers.&quot; Canada's share of the U.S.lumber market has declined to 26%, the lowest level in 13years, from a peak of almost 33% in 1985.   By terminating the agreement, Mr. Apsey said &quot;Canada hasregained its ability to determine forest policy and timberpricing issues in this country without having to check withWashington.&quot;   C.T. Howlett Jr., chairman of the U.S. Coalition for FairLumber Imports and a vice president of Georgia-Pacific Corp.,Atlanta, warned that the agreement's termination &quot;willinevitably lead to more subsidized lumber imports and areturn to the devastation that subsidized Canadian lumbervisited on the U.S. industry in the mid-1980s.&quot; Thecoalition's members include associations of U.S. lumbermanufacturers and major lumber producers.   Mr. Howlett said the coalition will &quot;pursue vigorously&quot;trade remedies under U.S. trade law including import fees onCanadian lumber.   Canadian government officials predicted that theagreement's termination will have little impact on thestumpage fees set by the provinces for their timber, mainlybecause of domestic pressure. &quot;The Canadian public has becomeincreasingly concerned with forest stewardship and renewal,&quot;the government said. As a result, it said provinces haveenacted policies that have increased timber costs to industrysignificantly since 1986. &quot;If anything, this trend is likelyto continue, given the fact that the public pressure forbetter forest management is expected to intensify,&quot; thegovernment said.   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Septembercontract, trading without a price limit, settled at $188.60for each thousand board feet, off $6.50, while the Novembercontract ended the day at $186, off $5, the daily pricelimit.   Lorenzo Merrill, forest products analyst for LehmanBrothers in Eugene, Ore., said that when the tax iscompletely removed by late fall he expects lumber to trade inthe $150-to-$160 range. &quot;We are at the end of the{construction} season and no one wants to take any inventoryrisk by buying lumber this late in the year,&quot; said Mr.Merrill. He said he expects lumber producers to sell futuresto try to protect their production.</TEXT></DOC>
