The most horrifying aspect of that tragedy was that it was largely man-made. The Marxist government refused to allow relief groups into rebel-occupied areas, and hundreds of thousands died of starvation after brutal resettlement programs interrupted planting. A similar sordid story soon may be repeated in Mozambique, a drought- and war-ravaged country in southern Africa. Once again Western aid may do more to prop up a repressive regime than feed the suffering.    A famine in Mozambique now threatens an estimated 4.5 million people. The U.S. government has promised $75 million in emergency food aid, but all aid will be channeled through the Marxist regime. U.S. policy has been to avoid any contact whatever with RENAMO, the anti-communist resistance that has waged an increasingly successful civil war against the government since 1975. Yet at least a third of the population lives in RENAMO-controlled areas.    According to Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, the Agency for International Development, which is in charge of U.S. assistance, &quot;has offered the lame excuse that they cannot locate anyone from RENAMO to talk to. In fact, there is a RENAMO office here in Washington that is practically beating down the door of the State Department to ask for aid. . . . I call on the State Department and AID to get off their duffs . . . and start the food flowing to people who do not have much time left.&quot;    The famine-aid debate has spilled over into the fight over confirmation of Melissa Wells as the next U.S. ambassador to Mozambique. Mrs. Wells has described RENAMO members as &quot;bandits,&quot; the same term used by the Marxist regime, and -- echoing the State Department -- says they have no popular support, a view challenged by many journalists.    In hope of weaning Mozambique away from the Soviet orbit, the State Department and Mrs. Wells also have played down both the brutal nature of the regime and its ties to the Eastern bloc. Free-lancer Sam Levy reported from Mozambique on this page last year that the regime's &quot;totalitarian inspiration&quot; is clear and that, as in Ethiopia, there have been mass deportations to brutal rural work camps. Mozambique still calls the Soviet Union its &quot;natural ally,&quot; and hosts military advisers from the Soviet Union, Cuba, North Korea -- and Ethiopia.    On May 1, a bipartisan group of 28 senators blocked consideration of the Wells nomination in what Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd called &quot;unprecedented opposition&quot; to an ambassadorial candidate. A showdown vote is expected tomorrow.    Barring compelling circumstances, a president is entitled to have the people he wants in executive-branch positions. Our concern is not so much with Mrs. Wells but with the State Department's policy on Mozambique, which has gone astray in forswearing any contact with or aid to RENAMO.    President Reagan recently said he would be reviewing U.S. policy on Mozambique. Such a review is long overdue. The first question it must answer is why AID is denying needed supplies to millions of people whose only crime is that they do not live under the control of a brutal dictatorship. </TEXT></DOC>
