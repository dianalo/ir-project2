The Fed, by a 6-0 vote, approved the regulations, which rewardinstitutions for directing their deposits into prudent investmentssuch as government securities and home mortgages.   Starting Dec. 31, 1990, banks will have to hold capital _representing the stockholders' investment in the institution _ of7.25 percent of loans and other assets. The minimum will increase to8 percent two years later. The current standard is 6 percent.   But banks will get a break for certain kind of investments. Theywill only have to hold half as much capital for home mortgages,one-fifth as much capital for mortgage-backed securities sponsoredby government agencies and no capital for U.S. government securities.   Diane Casey, director of regulatory affairs for the IndependentBankers Association, a trade group, said the rules may have theeffect of making more mortgage money available.   ``You will see banks that have ceased making mortgage loanslooking again at mortgage loans because the risk-weighting is suchnow that they can afford to make them,'' she said.   The regulations could also provide a wider market in the UnitedStates for government securities, which have increasingly been soldto investors in Europe and Japan, she said.   Board member Wayne Angell objected to the zero risk rating forgovernment securities, saying, ``There is always some risk.'' Healso said the 20 percent rating for many mortgage-backed securities``is on the side of inadequate'' and complained, ``I see in front ofme a document that doesn't do much.''   However, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said the regulations, bytheir nature, ``cannot be better than merely satisfactory.''   Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said the regulation was ``animportant first step. ... It may be unsatisfactory relative to someideal, but I think it's highly satisfactory to where we were.''   Beginning with the effective date of the rule _ Feb. 15 _ bankswill have to show that they are working toward meeting the stifferrequirements by the 1990 and 1992 deadlines.   An earlier version of the rules was approved by the FederalReserve on Aug. 3. Board member Martha Seger, who dissented at thetime, was not present at Friday's meeting.   Fed staff members said they hoped by the end of 1990 to developstandards that would adjust banks' capital according to theirvulnerability to changes in interest rates. The standards adoptedFriday apply to the risk of default.   Other federal banking agencies _ the Office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency, which regulates nationally chartered banks, and theFederal Deposit Insurance, which oversees federally insured statechartered banks _ are expected to approve similar capital guidelinessoon. The Fed regulates bank holding companies and banks that belongto its system.   The rules bring U.S. regulations into conformance with aninternational agreement adopted a year ago in Basel, Switzerland, bythe Fed and the central banks of 11 other major industrializedcountries.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which supervised savingsinstitutions, is working on risk-based capital rule, but no actionis expected until at least March.</TEXT></DOC>
