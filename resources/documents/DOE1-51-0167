<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-51-0167 </DOCNO><TEXT>Tectonic subsidence curves show that the Illinois, Michigan, and Willistonbasins formed by initial fault-controlled mechanical subsidence duringrifting and by subsequent thermal subsidence. Thermal subsidence beganaround 525 Ma in the Illinois Basin, 520-460 Ma in the Michigan Basin,and 530-500 Ma in the Williston Basin. In the Illinois Basin, a secondsubsidence episode (middle Mississippian through Early Permian) was causedby flexural foreland subsidence in response to the Alleghanian-Hercynianorogeny. Past workers have suggested mantle phase changes at the baseof the crust, mechanical subsidence in response to isostatically uncompensatedexcess mass following igneous intrusions, intrusion of mantle plumesinto the crust, or regional thermal metamorphic events as causes of basininitiation. Cratonic basins of North America, Europe, Africa, and SouthAmerica share common ages of formation, histories of sediment accumulation,temporal volume changes of sediment fills, and common dates of interregionalunconformities. Their common date of formation suggests initiation ofcratonic basins in response to breakup of a late Precambrian supercontinent.This supercontinent acted as a heat lens that caused partial meltingof the lower crust and upper mantle followed by emplacement of anorogenicgranites during extensional tectonics in response to supercontinent breakup.Intrusion of anorogenic granites and other partially melted intrusiverocks weakened continental lithosphere, thus providing a zone of localizedregional stretching and permitting formation of cratonic basins almostsimultaneously over sites of intrusion of these anorogenic granites andother partially melted intrusive rocks.</TEXT></DOC>
