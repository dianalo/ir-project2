(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The light green leaves of some trees inthe middle of the dark green forest of Michigan's Lower Peninsulahave the fragile look of spring's new growth, and some scatteredtrees show exposed, brown branches.   The thinner growth is evidence of a ravenous little caterpillar_ the juvenile stage of the gypsy moth _ that is making lifemiserable for uncounted people across the United States.   And the drought is increasing the damage, as trees alreadyweakened by lack of water try to fight off the effects of repeateddefoliation by the hungry caterpillar.</TEXT><DATELINE>NARSINGHPUR, India (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rainshowers over northern India in thepast week have raised hopes of a good harvest after three years ofdevastating drought.   Farmers have dispatched tractors and bullock teams to plow theirdusty brown fields so they can begin sowing the summer crop.   ``If it keeps raining, it will be fantastic,'' said Ram Phal, afarmer in Narsinghpur, 25 miles southwest of New Delhi. ``I canhear frogs croaking at night and that means a good monsoon.''

A massive criminal investigation of Pentagon contractingpractices is centered on the passing of secret information toprivate consultants, who in turn sold it to contractors.   The system wasn't widely talked about between the DefenseDepartment and contractors and so ``my mouth fell open'' when acontractor she had never met called to ask her for aninterpretation of a document she had written, testified Caroline A.Chewning, who works for the Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency as a program management officer.</TEXT><DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new Airbus 320 that crashed at an air show wasflying too low for the load it carried and the pilot did not havetime to maneuver it out of danger, officials said Monday followinga preliminary investigation.   Three passengers were killed and 50 injured as the jetlingercrashed into the woods Sunday during a demonstration flight nearMulhouse in eastern France.   Daniel Tennenbaum, chief of the Civil Aviation Authority, saidthe Air France jet was flying at 30 feet.   In Mulhouse, prosecutor Jean Volff said: ``The A320 passed at 30feet altitude, which is completely outside the technical norms whenit is carrying passengers.''   He said the normal minimum altitude for such conditions was 100feet and added, without giving details, that the pilot had``disconnected the automatic controls at the moment of the accidentand was in manual control.''   Tennenbaum told a news conference in Paris the fullycomputerized aircraft needed eight seconds to respond to thecommand of pilot Michel Hasseline and only five seconds wereavailable because of the low altitude.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Communities may ban picketing aimedspecifically at someone's home, the Supreme Court ruled by a 6-3vote Monday.   The court, saying ``there simply is no right to force speechinto the home of an unwilling listener,'' ruled that such bans donot necessarily violate free-speech rights.   But the justices unanimously rejected arguments that publicstreets in residential neighborhoods are not the type oftraditional public forum where freedom of expression is protected.   The court therefore said communities may not ban pickets frommarching through a residential neighborhood, or even walking backand forth along a block on which the home they want to target islocated.   The decision is a defeat for anti-abortion activists who werebarred from picketing a doctor's home in the Milwaukee suburb ofBrookfield, Wis.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 24-year-old junior securities analyst forMorgan Stanley andamp; Co. was accused Monday along with a Hong Kongbusinessman of making $19 million in illegal profits in an insidertrading scheme.
