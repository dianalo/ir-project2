ChairmanWilliam Seidman suggested that any restructuring of thesavings-and-loan bailout system include consolidating thegovernment's liquidation activities for failed banks andthrifts.   In a letter to Sen. Robert Kerrey (D., Neb.), Mr. Seidmanproposed that the Resolution Trust Corp., which disposes ofthe assets of failed thrifts, be empowered to carry the sameduties in commercial bank insolvencies. Currently, the FDICdisposes of assets of failed banks. Mr. Seidman heads bothagencies.</LP><TEXT>   The FDIC chairman rejected a proposal under review inCongress to streamline the bailout process by abolishing theRTC's dual board structure; the agency has one board todirect day-to-day operations and another to formulate overallpolicy. He also objected to proposals to sever formal tiesbetween the FDIC and the RTC.   &quot;If anything, probably we should be moving towardconsolidating the liquidation function,&quot; Mr. Seidman said.&quot;We would not recommend separating the two organizations atthis time, unless the plan is to turn the RTC into aseparate, permanent real-estate disposal organization forgovernment agencies.&quot;   The banking industry acknowledges that consolidation ofliquidation activities could improve efficiency and savings,but it still opposes the notion. Industry officials note thatthe FDIC's liquidation operations are backed by insurancepremiums charged to banks, while RTC activities are backed bytaxpayers.   &quot;We've got a lot of reservations about it,&quot; said MarkBerneko, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association.&quot;It amounts to having the banks penalized for the collapse ofthe savings-and-loan insurance fund.&quot;   Mr. Seidman's proposal appears to resurrect and expand onthe concept behind a now-defunct agency, the Federal AssetDisposition Association. FADA, a quasiprivate governmentagency once charged with asset disposition, was killed byCongress in 1989 after coming under scrutiny for poorperformance.   &quot;That doesn't mean the model can't be made to work,&quot; saidSenate Banking Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.). &quot;That'snot to say I'm an advocate of that, but I'm going to give ita look. We're going to look at ideas like that.&quot;   Recognizing that Congress wants changes, the RTC initiatedan internal review of the operation several weeks ago. Anagency official familiar with the review said the examinationis continuing, but that Mr. Seidman's proposal signals itsdirection.</TEXT></DOC>
