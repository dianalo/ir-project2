Key to the struggle is the group of 20 swing Democrats organized by Oklahoma Rep. McCurdy. At least seven -- including Texans Chapman, Bustamante and Andrews -- say they would vote no as of today. Four more are leaning against.    Democratic leaders rush to draw up their alternative regional-aid plan before Wednesday's scheduled Contra vote. Some lawmakers, including McCurdy, want a look at the alternative before deciding on the Reagan plan. The president turns up the heat to retain GOP support, meeting with 10 shaky Republicans; so far, only New York's Houghton has said he will vote no. Democrats are confident but note Ortega's history of ill-timed maneuvers and Reagan's planned appeal to the nation Tuesday night.    &quot;President Reagan has six more days -- and so does Daniel Ortega,&quot; says one aide.    REAGAN'S BUDGET should be less contentious than it has been in years past.    Democratic leaders are especially wary of another spending squabble after the bad publicity over congressional excesses in last month's spending resolution. Moreover, broad defense and domestic spending numbers were set in last fall's spending accord between the White House and Congress, vastly reducing areas for friction.    One big winner in the new budget is Transportation Secretary Burnley, who persuaded the president to double OMB's figure for new air-traffic controllers. Anti-drug programs will get a 12% increase. But Social Security chief Hardy is a loser; she failed to win elimination of the earnings cap on retirees under age 70, even though Reagan has called the cap &quot;an injustice.&quot;    CANDIDATES JOSTLE for an edge on the issues as voting nears.    Bush and Dole ads both extol a line-item veto, though the issue largely fails to stir voters. The GOP candidates trade more-telling blows over Social Security; Kemp scores in New Hampshire with tough attacks on both the front-runners, accusing them of supporting benefit cuts.    Trade fuels Gephardt's Iowa rise but doesn't help in low-unemployment New Hampshire. Gore, with an eye on the South, stresses his moderate defense views, while Dukakis hits at Contra aid in Iowa. Strongly pushed by retirees' groups, long-term health care emerges as a surprising issue; Simon and Gephardt are seen as the prime beneficiaries.    Except for Jackson, candidates in both parties avoid criticizing Israel's rough handling of Palestinian disturbances, for fear of offending Jewish voters.    CHANCES FADE that Volcker will be named to the bipartisan commission to find a way to shrink the federal deficit despite the hopes of those who pushed for the panel. Volcker himself hasn't expressed great interest, congressional Democrats already have made their choices, and Republicans fear Volcker might call for tax increases.    ROYAL TREATMENT: Federal election reports show the Teamsters' PAC bought 1,000 copies of Speaker Wright's book in 1986, a deal that under his unusually favorable royalty arrangement earned him $3,250. &quot;I'd like to sell a million of them like that,&quot; the publisher says. All told, the book cleared $55,000 for Wright.    JESSE'S COS: Bill Cosby tapes commercials for Jackson's presidential campaign, urging voters to forget about electability and listen to what the candidate is saying. But the Jackson campaign says it isn't sure when -- or if -- the spots will be used.    REAGAN'S CLAIMS of economic progress in his State of the Union left out some salient facts. Though the budget deficit has declined to 3.4% of GNP from 6.3%, as Reagan said, the gap was only 2.6% when he took office in 1981. And his claim that Americans &quot;climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate&quot; in more than a decade was true because of a huge increase in poverty during his first two years in office.    DRIFT AND UNCERTAINTY beset Justice over Meese's problems.    To avoid conflict-of-interest problems, the attorney general is forced to delegate important decisions on the Teamsters lawsuit, independent-counsel litigation and other matters to senior officials. Inquiries into his conduct will drag on; congressional probers vow to continue hearings well into the presidential campaign.    Preoccupied by his own problems, Meese has moved slowly to find a new No. 3 official to replace Stephen Trott, nominated months ago to the appeals court. The attorney general's role in shaping administration policy is also diminished. His initiatives on revising liability laws and reducing juvenile-delinquency grants fall by the wayside.    Prosecutors step up pressure on former Meese associates Chinn and Wallach to get them to testify against him -- so far apparently without success.    MINOR MEMOS: The New Hampshire GOP sells T-shirts bearing a picture of Dukakis with a red slash through it, and the motto: &quot;No Dukes.&quot; . . . Round two? Bush's next scheduled live TV interview, a week from Sunday, will be on an ABC program including Sam Donaldson. . . . Late for a press briefing, White House spokesman Fitzwater quips: &quot;Are you going to judge my whole career by this one episode?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
