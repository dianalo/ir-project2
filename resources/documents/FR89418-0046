On December 9, 1988, petitionerfiled a request for alignment of the countervailing duty and antidumpingfinal determinations. This postponement was approved under section 705of the Act and published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 13, 1989 (54 FR 6562). On March 29, 1989, in accordance with Article 5, paragraph 3 of the Agreementon Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI, and XXIII of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT Subsidies Code), we notifiedU.S. Customs to terminate the suspension of liquidation in this investigationas of April 1, 1989. Petitioner withdrew its request for a public hearingon March 3, 1989, and respondents withdrew their requests on March 8, 1989.We received written comments from petitioner on March 16 and March 20,1989, and from respondents on February 23 and March 20, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedules </T3>(HTS), as provided for in section1201 <T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS sub-headings. The HTS sub-headings are provided for convenience andCustoms purposes. The products covered by this investigation are industrial belts and componentsand parts thereof, whether cured or uncured, formerly provided for underTSUSA item numbers 358.0210, 358,0290, 358.0610, 358.0690, 358.0800, 358.0900,358.1100, 358.1400, 358.1600, 657.2520, 773.3510, and 773.3520 and currentlyclassifiable under HTS item numbers 3926.9055, 3926.9056, 3926.9057, 3926.9059,3926.9060, 4010.1010, 4010.1050, 4010.9111, 4010.9115, 4010.9119, 4010.9150,4010.9911, 4010.9915, 4010.9919, 4010.9950, 5910.0010, 5910.0090, and 7326.2000.The merchandise covered by this investigation includes certain industrialbelts for power transmission. These include V-belts, synchronous belts,round belts and flat belts, in part or wholly of rubber or plastic, andcontaining textile fiber (including glass fiber) or steel wire, cord orstrand, and whether in endless (i.e., closed loop) belts, or in beltingin lengths or links. This investigation excludes conveyor belts and automotivebelts as well as front engine drive belts found on equipment powered byinternal combustion engines, including trucks, tractors, buses, and lifttrucks. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs </ITAG>Because the Government of Israel (GOI) and Magam United Rubber IndustriesLtd. (Magam) withdrew their questionnaire responses, this determinationis based on the best information available.For each program found to be countervailable in prior countervailing dutyinvestigations involving Israel, we used as the best information availablethe highest rate ever found for that program in previous countervailingduty determinations or administrative reviews involving products from Israel.We did not conduct a verification, since respondents withdrew their responsesfrom the record of the investigation. Based upon our analysis of the petition, written comments from petitionerand respondents and prior Israeli cases, we determine the following: I. Programs Determined to Confer Subsidies We determine that subsidies are being provided to manufactures, producers,or exporters in Israel of industrial belts under the following programs:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. The Encouragement of Capital Investment Law (ECIL) Grants </ITAG>The purpose of the ECIL is to attract capial investment to Israel. In orderto be eligible to receive various benefits under the ECIL, including investmentgrants, drawback grants, capital grants, accelerated depreciation, andreduced tax rates, the applicant must obtain ``approved enterprise'' status.(ECIL interest subsidy payments and tax programs are listed below under``Programs Determined Not to Be Used''.) Approved enterprise status isobtained after review of information submitted to the Ministry of Industryand Trade, Investment Center Division. Using our <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Potassium Chloridefrom Israel </T3>(49 FR 35122, September 14, 1984) as the best informationavailable, we determine that the provision of investment grants under thisprogram confers a subsidy on exports of industrial belts from Israel andthat the estimated net subsidy for all producers and exporters of industrialbelts from Israel is 1.18 percent <T3>ad valorem. </T3> <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Exchange Rate Risk Insurance </ITAG>The Exchange Rate Risk Insurance Scheme (EIS), operated by the Israel ForeignTrade Risk Insurance Corporation Ltd. (IFTRIC), is aimed at insuring exportersagainst losses which result when the rate of inflation exceeds the rateof devaluation and the New Israeli Shekel (NIS) value of an exporter'sforeign currency receivables does not rise enough to cover increases inlocal costs. The EIS scheme is optional and open to any exporter willing to pay premiumsto IFTRIC. Compensation is based on a comparison of the change in the rateof devaluation of the NIS against a basket of foreign currencies with thechange in the consumer price index. If the rate of inflation is greaterthan the rate of devaluation, the exporter is compensated by an amountequal to the difference between these two rates multiplied by the value-addedof the exports. If the rate of devaluation is higher than the change inthe domestic price index, however, the exporter must compensate IFTRIC.The premium is calculated for all participants as a percentage of the value-addedsales value of exports. IFTRIC changes this percentage rate periodicallybut, at any given time, it is the same for all exporters. In determining whether an export insurance program provides a countervailablebenefit, we examine whether the premiums and other charges are adequateto cover the program's long-term operating costs and losses. In the lastIsraeli investigation, <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Industrial PhosphoricAcid from Israel </T3>(52 FR 25447, July 7, 1987) (<T3>Phosphoric Acid</T3>), we found that this program conferred a countervailablebenefit. Using our determination in <T3>Phosphoric Acid </T3>as the best information available, we determinethat this program confers an export subsidy on exports of industrial beltsfrom Israel. For the preliminary determination we used the rate calculated for thisprogram in the <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain FreshCut Flowers from Israel </T3>(52 FR 3316, February 3, 1987) as the bestinformation available with respect to the amount of the subsidy. For thisdetermination, we are using the rate calculated in <T3>Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review: FreshCut Roses from Israel </T3>(54 FR 10395, March 13, 1989), since it is nowthe highest rate found for this program in all previous countervailingduty determinations and administrative reviews. On this basis, we determinethat the estimated net subsidy for all producers and exporters of industrialbelts in Israel is 9.18 percent <T3>ad valorem. </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">C. Long-term Industrial Development Loans </ITAG>Prior to July 1985, approved enterprises were eligible to receive long-termindustrial development loans funded by the GOI. In <T3>Phosphoric Acid, </T3>we determined that loans under this program areprovided to a diverse number of industries. However, the interest ratescharged on these loans vary depending on the development zone locationof the borrower. The interest rates on loans to borrowers in DevelopmentZone A are lowest, while those on loans to borrowers in the Central Zoneare highest. In the absence of government and company questionnaire responses and verifiedinformation, we assume, as the best information available, that the producersand exporters of industrial belts in Israel are not located in the CentralZone. Therefore, we determine that this program confers a regional subsidyon exports of industrial belts from Israel. Using the rate calculated inthe <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Oil Country TubularGoods from Israel </T3>(52 FR 1651, July 7, 1987) as the best informationavailable, we determine that the estimated net subsidy for all producersand exporters of industrial belts in Israel is 5.02 percent <T3>ad valorem. </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">D. Encouragement of Research and Development Law (ERDL) Grants </ITAG>Petitioner alleges that research and development grants equal to 50 percentof approved project costs are available under ERDL where such activityis directed at export expansion. Using as the best information availableour determination in <T3>Phosphoric Acid, </T3>we determine that this program confers a subsidyon exports of industrial belts from Israel and that the estimated net subsidyfor all producers and exporters of industrial belts in Israel is 0.04 percent<T3>ad valorem.</T3>II. Programs Determined Not to be UsedUsing as the best information available the non-use of the following programsin previous investigations, we determine that the programs below were notused by manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Israel of industrialbelts during the review period. For a full description of these programs,see the <T3>Preliminary Determination.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">A. </ITAG><T3>Certain Benefits Under the Encouragement of Capital Investment Law(ECIL)</T3>1. <T3>Accelerated Depreciation Under Section 42</T3>2. <T3>Direct Reduction of Corporate Tax Under Section 47</T3>3. <T3>Interest Subsidy Payments</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">B. </ITAG><T3>Labor Training Grants from the Ministry of Labor</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">C. </ITAG><T3>Special Export Marketing Financing from the Bank of Israel</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>On June 30, 1988, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Israel. Section705(a)(2) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat:A. The alleged subsidy is inconsistent with the Agreement, andB. There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.We generally consider the following factors in determining whether importshave been massive over a relatively short period of time: (1) The volumeand value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends (if applicable); and (3)the share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports. 19 CFR 355.16(f)(53 FR 52306, 52350)In our preliminary determination of critical circumstances we used importstatistics for the basket TSUSA categories applicable to industrial beltsand determined that imports of the subject merchandise in the basket TSUSAcategories from Israel were not massive over a relatively short period.For our final determination, however, we decided not to rely on basket-categoryimport statistics. Instead, we are using an approach adopted in the recentantidumping determinations on antifriction bearings. In these determinationsthe Department assumed massive imports when import statistics were basedon basket TSUSA categories and respondents did not supply information oncompany-specific exports of the subject merchandise or the informationsupplied could not be verified. See, for example, <T3>Final Determinations of Sales at Less than Fair Value: AntifrictionBearings (Other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from theFederal Republic of Germany </T3>and <T3>Final Determinations of Sales at Less than Fair Value: AntifrictionBearings (other than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from theUnited Kingdom. </T3>The Commerce Department made these final determinationson March 24, 1989.In this investigation we have circumstances which are similar to thosein the antifriction bearings investigations. The import statistics arebased on basket TSUSA categories and respondents withdrew their responses.Therefore, as best information available, we are assuming that importsfrom Israel have been massive over a relatively short period of time.As described above, we have determined, on the basis of the best informationavailable, that the GOI provides export subsidies on the merchandise underinvestigation. Article 9 of the GATT Subsidies Code prohibits the use ofexport subsidies on non-primary products. However, Article 14 providesan exception for developing countries, provided they do not use ``exportsubsidies on their industrial products * * * in a manner which causes seriousprejudice to the trade or production of another signatory'' (Article 14,paragraph 3).For a developing country like Israel, then the issue is whether we findthat export subsidies are causing ``serious prejudice'' to U.S. trade orproduction of industrial belts. Under section 771(7)(c)(iii) of the Act,the ITC evaluates all relevant economic factors bearing on the state ofthe industry, including actual and potential decline in output, sales,market share, profits, productivity, return on investment, and capacityutilization. Thus, in making its preliminary and final injury determinations,the ITC considers trade and production in the United States. We concludethat, in principle, serious prejudice can exist where material injury toa U.S. industry occurs by reason of imports benefiting from export subsidies.Based upon the information in the record and the ITC's affirmative preliminarydetermination of August 14, 1988, we conclude that serious prejudice existswithin the meaning of Article 14, paragraph 3. Therefore, we find thatIsrael's export subsidies on industrial belts are inconsistent with theGATT Subsidies Code.For the reasons discussed above, we find that critical circumstances existwithin the meaning of section 705(a)(2) of the Act. If the ITC's finaldetermination should be negative, our critical circumstance finding willbecome moot; in any event, under section 705(a)(4)(A) of the Act, the ITCmust make its own affirmative determination of critical circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="84"><T3>Comments </T3></ITAG><T3>Comment 1: </T3>Petitioner claims that the Department should countervailall subsidy programs found to be used in prior Israeli cases at the highestrate calculated for each program, including programs subsequently foundto have been discontinued. In making its determination on the basis ofthe best information available, the Department must adversely infer thatrespondents failed to supply information on possible new programs thatmay have been created to replace the discontinued programs. The Departmentshould use the subsidy rates applicable to the discontinued programs asthe best information available for the new programs that may have beenestablished. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>Since respondents withdrew their responses fromthe record in this investigation, the Department made its final determinationon the basis of the best information available, using as the best informationits findings from past countervailing duty determinations or administrativereviews concerning products from Israel. In addition, to calculate a countervailingduty rate in this investigation, the Department used the highest countervailingduty rate previously found in any final countervailing duty determinationor administrative review for each of the programs. In so doing, the Department has adversely inferred that respondent hasused each of the ongoing programs previously found countervailable, andthat respondent has realized from each program a benefit equal to the highestbenefit found in any countervailing duty determination or administrativereview. Petitioner has not provided any evidence of new programs that mayhave been established to replace the programs discontinued. Therefore,the Department sees no reason to make additional adverse inferences. <T3>Comment 2: </T3>Petitioner claims that the Department should recognizethe existance of a new program granting a partial risk guarantee for unsuccessfulexport marketing activities and should determine that this program is countervailable.(This program was briefly mentioned in the government response, which,as noted above, was subsequently withdrawn.) Petitioner suggests usingthe exhange rate risk insurance scheme as a proxy for quantifying the benefitof the program. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We disagree. Both the GOI and Magam withdrew theirresponses from the record of this investigation. Consequently, the Departmentmade its determination on the basis of the best information available.As the best information available, the Department used the conclusionsreached in past Israeli cases. The Department considers it inappropriateto use a portion of the withdrawn response concerning an export marketrisk guarantee while disregarding the remainder of the responses. As setout in our response to <T3>Comment 3, </T3>we have refused to consider information from the withdrawnresponse concerning respondent's location within the Central Zone. It wouldbe inconsistent and inappropriate for the Department to pick and chooseinformation from the withdrawn response, using information unfavorableto respondents but not using information favorable to respondent. Furthermore,we note that petitioner has not supplied any substantive information withrespect to this possible other program, nor has it described how it mightbe countervailable. <T3>Comment 3:</T3> Respondents maintain that the Department failed touse the best information available in its preliminary determination fortwo of the programs under investigation: ECIL Grants and Long-Term IndustrialDevelopment Loans. Respondents indicate that benefits under these programsvary by zone and that no benefits are received by firms located in theCentral Zone. Respondents state that Magam is located in Central Zone andhave supplied a letter from the Government of Israel attesting to thisstatement. Respondents conclude that the Department should find that Magamhas received no benefits under these programs, since it is located in theCentral Zone.Petitioner claims that the Department should not accept incomplete informationsubmitted by Magam indicating that it may be within the Central Zone and,therefore, may be precluded from receiving preferential interest ratesunder the ECIL.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The GOI and Magam chose to withdraw their questionnaireresponses in this investigation. Therefore, we were unable to verify anyof the information needed to make this final determination. Under the provisionsof the Act, we must verify all information used in our final determination.Because we were unable to verify any information in this investigation,it was necessary to make this final determination on the basis of the bestinformation available. It would be contrary to the provisions of the Act and Department practiceto use partial information provided by respondents in the absence of completeand accurate questionnaire responses which were subject to verification.If the Department were to follow such a practice, potential respondentswould have no reason to respond to the Department's questionnaire and would,instead, provide only information favorable to their case. Obviously, thiswould be an unacceptable result. See <T3>Association Colombiana de Exportadores de Flores </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>Slip op. 89-3 (Ct. Int'1 Trade, January 6, 1989).<T3>Comment 4: </T3>Respondents claim that the Department should not makean affirmative determination of critical circumstances, since imports fromIsrael account for a small percentage of U.S. consumption of the subjectmerchandise.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> Because the Department's import data on the subjectmerchandise are based on basket TSUSA categories, we would normally lookto respondents for accurate data on exports of the subject merchandiseto the U.S.In this case, however, respondents have withdrawn their responses, thuseliminating our usual alternative source of import statistics. Therefore,as best information available, we are assuming that imports from Magamhave been massive over a relatively short period. Since, in this case,there are also export subsidies inconsistent with the agreement, as explainedin the critical circumstances section of this determination, we have madean affirmative determination of critical circumstances. See our discussionof this issue in the section of this notice on critical circumstances.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> Petitioner asserts that, in the scope of investigationat the preliminary determination, the Department listed only four of the18 HTS items corresponding to the nine TSUSA numbers. Petitioner requeststhat the Department list all 18 numbers in its final determination.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> The scope of this investigation has not changedsince the initiation. The petition included nine TSUSA item numbers andfour HTS sub-headings that petitioner believed corresponded to the TSUSAnumbers.The Harmonized Tariff Schedule went into effect on January 1, 1989. Basedon a January 1989 ITC publication, petitioner requested that the Departmentexpand the four HTS sub-headings to eighteen sub-headings.We consulted with the respondents in each country subject to concurrentcountervailing and antidumping investigations involving industrial beltsand received no objections to the petitioner's request.In our preliminary, as now, we note that the written description of theproducts covered by the investigation is dispositive. The HTS numbers areprovided for convenience and customs purposes as to the scope of the productcoverage.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>As noted above, the questionnaire responses in this investigation werewithdrawn. Therefore, we did not conduct a verification. In accordancewith section 776(c) of the Act, we made our final determination on thebasis of the best information available.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with our preliminary affirmative countervailing duty determinationpublished on December 2, 1988, we directed the U.S. Customs Service tosuspend liquidation on the products under investigation and to requirea cash deposit or bond equal to the duty deposit rate. This final countervailingduty determination was extended to coincide with the companion final antidumpingdeterminations, pursuant to section 606 of the Trade and Tariff Act of1984 (section 705(a)(1) of the Act). Under Article 5, paragraph 3 of theGATT Subsidies Code, provisional measures cannot be imposed for more than120 days without final affirmative determinations of subsidy and injury.Therefore, on March 29, 1989, we instructed the U.S. Customs Service todiscontinue the suspension of liquidation on the subject merchandise enteredon or after April 1, 1989, but to continue the suspension of liquidationof all entries, or withdrawals from warehouse, for consumption of the subjectmerchandise entered between December 2, 1988, and March 31, 1989. Sincewe are now making a final affirmative determination of critical circumstances,the suspension of liquidation becomes retroactive to September 3, 1988,which is 90 days prior to the date on which liquidation was first suspended.We shall instruct the U.S. Customs Service also to suspend liquidationon all unliquidated entries made between September 3, 1988, and December1, 1988. If the ITC issues a final affirmative injury determination, wewill reinstate suspension of liquidation under section 705 of the Act onthe date of publication of the countervailing duty order and again requirea cash deposit on all entries of the subject merchandise in an amount equalto 15.42 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification</ITAG>In accordance with section 705(d) of the Act, we will notify the ITC ofour determination. In addition, we are making available to the ITC allnonprivileged and nonproprietary information relating to this investigation.We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and business proprietaryinformation in our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not disclosesuch information, either publicly or under an administrative protectiveorder, without the written consent of the Assistant Secretary for ImportAdministration.If the ITC determines that material injury, or the threat of material injury,does not exist, this proceeding will be terminated and all estimated dutiesdeposited or securities posted as a result of the suspension of liquidationwill be refunded or cancelled. If, however, the ITC determines that suchinjury does exist, we will issue a countervailing duty order, directingCustoms officers to assess countervailing duties on all entries of industrialbelts from Israel entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption,as described in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.This determination is published pursuant to section 705(d) of the Act (19U.S.C. 1671d(d)).<ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy N.
