<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-90-1009 </DOCNO><TEXT>The mechanism of interaction between benzene or toluene suspensions ofthe Cp/sub 2/ZrH/sub 2/, Cp/sub 2/ZrH(Cl), Cp/sub 3/ZrH complexes andspin traps (ST) at 20 deg C has been studied by the ESR method. Certainnitrozo compounds and {alpha}-phenyl-N-tert.-butylnitron have been usedas ST. The complex character of zirconium complex interaction with STis established. The primary stage of this interaction is, probably, electrontransport from zirconium hydrides to electron acceptors with zirconiumradical-cation formation. Both zirconium radicals-cations and zirconium-centeredradicals can serve as radical generators in the reactions studied.</TEXT></DOC>
