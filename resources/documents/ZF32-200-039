(Products).andO;Product:   Plus Development Hardcard (Hard disk drive) (Design andconstruction)Microsoft Windows (Graphical user interface) (Usage).andO;Topic:     Hard DiskDisk DrivesStorage CapacityBoards/Cards.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Last summer, we worried about the big decisions in bringing in Windows 3.0:training costs, new applications costs, buying mice, adding memory and,often, upgrading users from 286 to 386SX or 386DX platforms.andP;  Half the timespent in my consulting practice last summer was devoted to working withclients on Windows-yes/Windows-no decisions.andM;Now, in this winter of our slowly fading discontent with Windows, we'reworrying about the little things -- like, for example, users who complainthat their hard disks, which once had a comfortable 10M or 20M bytes ofstorage space left on them, are now full.andM;Although we all talked a lot about disk capacity last summer, those wordsoften went unheard.andP;  It was a lot more fun to talk about SX vs.andP;  DXperformance, to ask whether we could wait for 1991's wave of 16-inchhigh-resolution color monitors and cards, to debate the mouse vs.andP;  trackballquestion, to speculate about SIMM prices and whether people would be happywith &quot;only&quot;4M bytes of RAM.andM;So hard-disk capacities in existing PCs got short shrift.andP;  You can alwayssqueeze a lot more on there, right?andP;  People would just have to develop betterwork habits and clean out all those old files.andM;But people don't like to give up their old files, and they don't want to getrid of programs they haven't used in years.andM;The result, for a lot of users I work with, is that the hard-disk gas gaugeis running pretty near full.andM;For me, the answer has been to turn to the latest versions of one of the verybest products I've ever put into clients' computers: the Plus DevelopmentHardcard.andM;Over the years I've spec'ed literally thousands of Plus Hardcards for clientcompanies' machines.andP;  The failure rate has been so low as to be almost nil.andO;More important, the satisfaction rate -- with the product's high performanceand reliability -- and with Plus' sensational support -- has been incrediblyhigh.andM;Of all the great products that have become something like corporate standardsin this business -- AST SixPaks, Hayes 1,200-bps modems, NEC monitors and soon -- I think the Plus Hardcards may be the best I've ever dealt with.andP;  Theywork.andP;  Period.andM;So when I first turned to Plus' newer 105M-byte Hardcard II XLs as a fast andcost-effective way to give users we'd &quot;Windowed&quot; a little breathing room, Ididn't worry about how they'd stand up.andM;And that has turned out to be just about right: They still just ...andP;  work.andM;The economics of Hardcards aren't so hot for new-machine setup.andP;  The105M-byte Hardcard sells for about $700 on the street; you can usually get an80M- to 100M-byte hard disk installed in a new box for less than that.andM;But they really shine as second hard disks in existing machines.andP;  Installinga second hard disk in an old PC is for most people like getting a root canaljob: something to be avoided at all costs.andM;It's a messy job at best.andP;  Watching you shuffle drives in and out of drivebays and bend crooked drive rails with heavy pliers does not inspireconfidence in the heart of the average PC user.andM;And there are way too many little glitches with hard-disk controller cards,once you lash a second hard disk onto them.andP;  Sure, you can fix the problem.andO;Just find that controller-card manual from three or four years ago.andM;What?andP;  You can't find it?andP;  You're not even sure you ever got it? And when youcall them, WD says they've made hundreds of BIOS changes since they made thatcard?andM;Buy a Hardcard.andP;  Drop it in.andP;  Add a device driver to the CONFIG.SYS file.andO;Add a line to the 386ENH group in the Windows SYSTEM.INI file if necessary.andO;Turn the machine on.andP;  Watch it run.andP;  Watch the happy user breathe deeply onceagain.andM;It takes five minutes, 10 if you schmooze a little.andP;  The PC user loves you.andO;And you go back to your shop confident that you won't be popping that boxopen again for a long time.andM;Because it works.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
