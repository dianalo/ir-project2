Factions in the House Energy and Commerce Committee are finallyexchanging proposals in quiet negotiations that started only afternine renegade Democrats led by Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., politelygrabbed the reins from warring chairmen.   In the Senate, George Mitchell, D-Maine, is openly threatening aparliamentary end-run around Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,an acid-rain control foe who has refused floor time to the Mitchellclean air bill that has been ready for debate since last September.   And on both sides of the Capitol, a new phrase has entered thevocabulary of lawmakers and environmental lobbyists trying to breakthe clean air logjam: Michael Dukakis.   Their message is clear: the Clean Air Act will be strengthened,possibly with the White House occupied by a man perceived to have astronger environmental commitment than Ronald Reagan or George Bush.   Mitchell's name is creeping into this scenario. He is acandidate to succeed Byrd next year when the West Virginian stepsdown from the Senate's most powerful post.   ``Hopefully, those who've tried to stop any legislation willlook at a new majority leader in the Senate and the possibility ofa Democratic administration in the White House and see that this isthe year to work out acid rain,'' says Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,the environmentalists' point man in the House.   Time is running short. Congress, which will take time off forthe national political conventions and its own re-electioncampaigns, has set an Aug. 31 deadline for action.   That is the stopgap date set last December as the Clean AirAct's deadline for metropolitan areas to meet standards for maximumlevels of ozone and carbon monoxide or risk sanctions like a ban onconstruction of new pollution sources.   More than 60 areas are not expected to attain the standards. Thedebate in Congress is over how much more time they should be givento reduce air pollution and what steps they must take to complywith the health-based standards.   The biggest apparent stumbling block on the House side iswhether to force automakers to produce vehicles with cleaneremissions and install equipment to capture polluting gasoline fumesduring refueling.   These are not pleasant questions for the powerful Energy andCommerce chairman, John Dingell, D-Mich., who comes from anautomaking district.   The acid rain component of the clean air struggle is far morecomplicated for lawmakers trying to combat coal-burning plantemissions that produce the fallout some scientists say poses humanhealth risks and harms lakes, coastal waters and building facades.   Byrd illustrates part of the complications. West Virginia notonly has power plants that would need improvements under theMitchell bill but also a high-sulfur coal industry in the northernpart of the state. It could be hurt if power plants switch tocleaner fuel like natural gas to meet the bill's requirements.   Most of the utilities that would be affected by an acid rainbill are in the Midwest. Lawmakers from that area don't want to seetheir constituents' electricity bills run up by expensivesmokestack scrubbers to clean up emissions.   Western lawmakers like the idea of being able to sell theirlow-sulfur coal to the Midwest. But many don't like Waxman's ideaof a surtax on electric bills nationwide to soften the blow onMidwestern ratepayers.   The power companies, like the Reagan administration, don't wantany acid rain legislation at all. These foes argue that scientistsare divided over the effects of acid deposition and that the nationshould await the arrival of clean-coal technology being soughtunder a $2.5 billion research program.   Southerners are not bystanders. Acid rain problems have shown upfrom Florida to Texas. Northeasterners, downwind from Midwesternutilities, want action, as does the environmental lobby.   Mitchell says he has been negotiating with colleagues, includingByrd, to get his bill to the floor. He said in an interview lastweek that supporters will take direct action if the leadershipdoesn't call the bill up for debate.   ``Clearly, there will be an effort to tack it on to somethingelse as an amendment,'' said Mitchell, one of 48 senators who havewritten Byrd asking for floor time.   Tina Evans, a Byrd spokeswoman, says the majority leader ``hasno plans to call up an acid rain bill.'' She quoted Byrd as saying:``Any senator may at any time call up an amendment to any bill. Iwould not be surprised if this is tried with acid rain.''   Meanwhile, the clock is ticking toward Aug. 31 with somesupporters of tougher air pollution control laws vowing to opposeanother deadline extension.   ``This really is a race with the clock,'' says Swift, addingthat his so-called Group of Nine hopes to have its own acid rainplan drafted in two weeks in an effort to get movement on thisissue in Energy and Commerce.   Waxman, co-sponsor of a tough acid rain bill with Rep. GerrySikorski, D-Minn., says he soon may call his health subcommitteeback to the table to try to win approval of a clean air package andthrow the issue to Dingell's full committee.   Waxman suspended bill-writing efforts nearly two months ago, hispanel still evenly split over the acid rain control question.</TEXT></DOC>
