Thailand, Syria and Iran are the only non-communist countriesthat ban the sale of U.S. cigarettes, Smith told reporters at ahearing Tuesday on his group's petition to force Thailand to allowthe sale and promotion of American cigarettes.   Under threat of trade retaliation, South Korea, Japan and Taiwanhave opened markets to American cigarettes since 1986, offsetting adecline in U.S. domestic sales.   Thailand's government runs a tobacco monopoly. The cigaretteassociation filed a petition with the U.S. trade representativeseeking government intervention after informal discussions withThailand ``didn't seem to be making headway,'' Smith said.   ``I hope it will be resolved toward the end of the year,'' Smithsaid at the hearing before a special committee of the U.S. traderepresentative. Carla Hills, the U.S. trade representative, is torecommend to President Bush by May 25, 1990 whether to formallyaccuse the Southeast Asian country of unfair trade practices andorder reprisals.   The tobacco exporters are facing opposition in the United States,however, with health organizations and other critics comparing theirpursuit of Asian markets to the 19th Century ``Opium War'' triggeredby efforts of British merchants to force China to import narcotics.   The argument for selling cigarettes abroad resembles that used inthe Britain in 1840 _ ``that if Britain did not profit from the saleof opium, someone else would,'' said Dr. Anne Marie O'Keefe, vicepresident of Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights.   ``When we are pleading with foreign governments to stop the flowof cocaine, it is the height of hypocrisy for the United States toexport tobacco,'' said U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.   But Gov. Jim Martin of North Carolina, the major U.S.tobacco-growing state, said that by raising health concerns, ``theThais speak out of both sides of their mouths in a simple effort toprotect the Thai cigarette monopoly.''   The Thai government did not testify but two Thai witnessespredicted the aggressive promotion of foreign cigarettes wouldreverse a decline in smoking recently achieved by a 15-year campaignagainst tobacco use. They justified the government tobacco monopolysystem as a means of regulating and discouraging consumption undertheir national health policy.   ``Where is the concern for humanity once felt by the UnitedStates?'' asked Thai Parliament member Surin Pitsuwan. He saidpromotion of U.S. cigarettes in Thailand could distract the Asiancountry from working with the United States against growing of opiumpoppies and trafficking of heroin and other hard drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
