Phil Henderson, vice president and general manager of HarrisGovernment Information Systems Division.andM;The weather system is the latest in a series of contracts the FAA has awardedas part of its National Airspace System plan.andP;  The NAS plan will upgrade thenation's air traffic control system.andM;The Harris system generates weather information especially pertinent toaviation weather forecasting, company officials said.andP;  The system gathersinformation from many sources, including National Weather Servicealphanumeric and graphic information, radar weather data and satelliteimagery from the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite and thePolar Orbiter Satellite, company officials said.andM;Control center meteorologists will have interactive workstations with thecapability to generate, annotate and display alpha-numeric imagery andgraphic weather products, company officials said.andM;In addition, each control center may have up to nine briefing terminals ateach site.andP;  The air traffic controller supervisors and the traffic managementunit will use these to get up-to-the-minute weather data to help direct theen route traffic.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
