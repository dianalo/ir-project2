Seib (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> TRE EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush said that, in his own mind, he has narrowed his search for a running mate to just a few candidates with whom he is comfortable.    But, in an interview in his White House office, Mr. Bush refused to say precisely how many candidates he is considering. &quot;I'm not discussing numbers at all,&quot; said Mr. Bush, who is expected to become the Republican presidential nominee at his party's convention in New Orleans in two weeks. &quot;We're going through a procedure that has really just been started, and it's going to include polling in some areas, and a little more will seep out on what names might be there, what I think we need to know from polling.&quot;    Mr. Bush has asked aides to begin background checks on potential running mates, and some recent reports have said that he is weighing a dozen or more candidates. But asked whether he actually was comfortable in his own mind with only a &quot;handful&quot; of candidates, Mr. Bush replied: &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot;    Among those Mr. Bush is believed to be seriously considering are Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, both former opponents for the Republican presidential nomination; Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip in the Senate and a friend of the vice president and his family; and, possibly, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, among others. In addition, the Bush campaign is considering the option of naming a woman to buoy the vice president's low popularity among female voters.    Mr. Bush reiterated that he doesn't plan to announce his choice until the Republican convention, which begins Aug. 15. Indeed, one aide said last week that Mr. Bush may try to keep his choice secret until Thursday, the final day of the convention.    Mr. Bush insisted that he is keeping his thoughts about the choice strictly to himself. &quot;This is something that is in here,&quot; he said, tapping his chest.    And he emphatically denied that he is &quot;Mondale-izing&quot; his search for a running mate, a reference to the process used by Walter Mondale, the 1984 Democratic presidential candidate. Mr. Mondale was accused of considering a long list of possible vice presidential nominees more because they represented certain interest groups than for their personal qualifications.    Mr. Bush said his search for a running mate is &quot;totally different from that.&quot; And, in an apparent slap at Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, who campaigned with several prospective vice presidential nominees before announcing his choice, Mr. Bush added: &quot;You're not going to see me marching arm-in-arm around somebody&quot; or appearing with potential running mates to check their popularity on the stump.    Mr. Bush also refused to discuss the plans of Treasury Secretary James Baker, a close friend from Texas who is expected to resign his cabinet post soon to lead the Bush general election campaign. But President Reagan is expected to announce Mr. Baker's departure either late this week or next week, before the Republican convention. The president is expected to announce at the same time his nomination of investment banker Nicholas Brady of Dillon Read andamp; Co., Inc., another good friend of Mr. Bush's, to succeed Mr. Baker.    Deputy Treasury Secretary Peter McPherson will serve as secretary until Mr. Brady can be confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Brady, a former New Jersey senator, is expected to be quickly confirmed and assume the Treasury post in September. </TEXT></DOC>
