(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker's brother assured followers atthe Jim and Tammy ministry on Sunday that the once-powerfultelevangelist was doing well in prison and his work would continue.   ``He sends his love to everyone,'' Norm Bakker told acongregation of about 175 at the storefront church at a shoppingmall. ``He says not to be concerned about him, that his spirits areup and that the Lord is looking out for him.''   Tammy Faye Bakker was staying Sunday at a $37.50-a-night room atthe Colony House motel in Talladega, Ala., about 40 miles east ofBirmingham, where her husband is being held awaiting transfer to aMinnesota prison.   Hotel managers instructed employees to block calls to Mrs.Bakker. However, desk clerk Debbie Bussey said Mrs. Bakkerregistered under another name on Friday and visited her husbandSaturday at the Talladega Federal Correctional Institution.   ``She said, `You can tell them I've been with him all day,'''Mrs. Bussey said.   Brian Ross, a prison spokesman, said he was not aware if Mrs.Bakker had been to the prison and couldn't comment in any event.``That's not public information,'' he said.   Prison officials said Friday that Bakker was expected to betransferred to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn.,within 10 days.   The 49-year-old PTL founder was sentenced Tuesday to 45 years inprison for defrauding supporters and diverting $3.7 million ofministry funds to support his lavish lifestyle.   Norm Bakker visited with his brother last week and said he hadbeen given a blue jumpsuit _ ``his favorite color'' _ and wasenjoying prison meals. ``He even had pizza once,'' he said.   Bakker's cellmate is ``a fine fellow ... who's trying to teachJim to make his bed military style,'' Norm Bakker told followers atthe ministry's church-studio.   The Rev. Gene Kennett of Erie, Pa., who preached in place of theBakkers, said the ministry would continue to operate while Bakkeris in prison.   ``We have not been evicted and our offices and prayer lines areopen,'' he said in response to reports that the mall's owner hadasked the ministry to pack up.   But Kennett confirmed that the ministry was looking for a newsite and would hold its last service at the mall next Sunday.   Kennett also said financial problems have forced the suspensionof the television gospel hour the ministry had been broadcastingtwice a week to a small number of stations.   ``Tammy will return to television when our present indebtednessis raised,'' he said. ``Your prayers, love and concern are verymuch needed at this time.''</TEXT></DOC>
