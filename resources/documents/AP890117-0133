The reason is simple mathematics. Those who declined outsideincome would receive the proposed $45,500 raise _ from $89,500 to$135,000 _ without giving up anything in the tradeoff.   But those who have been collecting outside fees would lose thatincome, offsetting a large chunk of the raise.   President Reagan has proposed the 50 percent increase for 2,498people _ members of Congress, top federal executives and Cabinetmembers. The proposal would become effective automatically unlessboth houses of Congress vote it down by Feb. 8 _ something notlikely to happen.   Lawmakers favoring the increase, however, have said they wouldgive up their outside fees if the raise goes through.   To illustrate the winners and losers, consider the case ofthree-term Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La. The chairman of theSenate Energy Committee received $47,625 in outside fees in 1987 andkept $34,940, near the maximum he could retain under Senate rules.   Johnston would receive a $45,500 raise, but after taking intoaccount the loss of his outside fees, he would be ahead by only$10,560.   On the other hand, two-term Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who takesno outside fees, would be $45,500 richer before taxes if he acceptedthe raise. However, Levin said he would not accept the salary hike.   Senators are permitted to keep outside fees totaling up to 40percent of salary, a current cap of $35,800. Any amount over thatfigure goes to charity.   House rules are different, allowing members to keep 30 percent ofsalary, or $26,850.   The outside fees normally come from special interest groupsseeking influence in Congress.   Levin said acceptance of honoraria leaves ``a terrible appearancethat somehow or other we're for sale. It's long overdue that we sayno to special interest groups putting dollars in our pockets.''   As for the pay bonanza he would receive, Levin said it isn'tjustified.   ``There's just no way to justify this pay hike at this time,'' hesaid. ``We have a huge deficit. The Congress will be asking theAmerican people for some shared sacrifice. You can't lead in thatkind of an issue by taking a pay increase yourself.''   An official of the self-styled citizen's lobby, Common Cause,said the important issue is eliminating outside fees, not the sizeof the raise.   Ann McBride, Common Cause senior vice president, said, ``Theissue is, we've got to get rid of this corrupt system. Specialinterest money should not be financing our public officials. We needto pay our public officials at an appropriate level.''</TEXT></DOC>
