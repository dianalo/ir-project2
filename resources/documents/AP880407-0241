The plane was refueled after the hijackers fired at securityguards at the Masshad airport and threatened to force the pilot tofly with the little fuel left in the jet's tanks, said the officialIslamic Republic News Agency.   It first quoted the hijackers as saying the plane would leave atmidnight (4:30 p.m. EDT), in a dispatch filed only two minutesbefore that time, and said later the departure had been delayeduntil 6 a.m. (10:30 p.m. EDT). The second departure time passedwith no new word from IRNA.   No destination was given.   According to IRNA, Iranian officials asked the hijackers for theextension to provide time for the Turkish and Pakistani primeministers, Turgut Ozal and Mohammed Khan Junejo, to talk to Kuwaitiofficials in an effort to convinve them to accept the hijackers'demand.   The hijackers, said to number five to seven, want Kuwait to free17 pro-Iran extremists convicted and imprisoned in the Persian Gulfsheikdom for bombings at the U.S. and French embassies there in1983.   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Ozal spoke by telephone withPrime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran on Thursday.   It said Musavi told Ozal his government wanted to end theincident without ``any unhappy event,'' but added: ``Of course youshould know that our possibilities are limited and therefore wehope the Kuwaiti government will understand the restrictions in theholy city of Mashhad and fulfil its humanitarian duty, in trying tobring the problem to a peaceful end.''   Thirty-two people were released from the plane early Thursdayand, along with 25 freed earlier, left Mashhad for Kuwait, theagency reported. The British Foreign Office said early Friday thatthe passengers had arrived in Kuwait.   The hijacking occurred early Tuesday, as the plane with 112people aboard was flying from Bangkok to Kuwait.   When IRNA reported the original departure time, it said ``thereare still obstacles on the runway,'' placed there earlier byairport officials to keep the jet from taking off.   On the third day of the drama, the hijackers said they placedexplosives throughout the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747, which stillhad 55 passengers and crew aboard, IRNA reported.   Among the hostages are three members of Kuwait's royal family.One appealed to Iranian authorities to provide jet fuel, IRNA said.   ``We're very tired and our brothers (the hijackers) are veryserious in their threat to blow up the plane,'' Fadel Khaledal-Sabah told the control tower by radio, IRNA reported.   The hijackers fired several shots out of the plane Thursdayafter repeating their demand for fuel, IRNA said. It did notmention casualties.   Iranian media and some of the freed hostages have described thehijackers as masked, Arabic-speaking men armed with pistols andhand grenades.   One of the passengers, Josef Degeorgi, 53, of Austria, told TheAssociated Press the gunmen carried handguns and claimed to havehand grenades. He said there were seven and that all wore masks.   In London, freed British passenger Jean Sefton was quotedThursday as saying that two of the hijackers offered her pillowsand drinks and chatted with her daughters in English.   ``We didn't have time to be frightened, things happened sofast,'' Ms. Sefton told London's Daily Mail.   IRNA had reported that Iranian officials were refusing to supplyfuel or food to the hijackers unless the passengers and crew werereleased. But the refueling went ahead without any more releasesreported.   IRNA paraphrased an Iranian negotiator, Deputy Prime MinisterAli-Reza Moayyeri, as saying a Kuwaiti negotiating team in Mashhad``does not take the issue (of the hijacking) seriously.''   Kuwait has rejected the hijackers' demands.   The Kuwait News Agency reported that the government sent aletter to Musavi praising Iran's efforts to end the hijacking butopposing any moves to allow the plane to leave.   Numerous acts of terrorism in Kuwait have been blamed on ShiiteMoslems acting with backing from Iran, which acccuses Kuwait ofaiding Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war. Kuwaiti diplomats were broughthome after their embassy in Tehran was ransacked.   Bahraini sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidpassports held by five alleged Bahrainis aboard the plane must befake.   They said that when the passport numbers were provided byauthorities in Bangkok and checked in Bahrain, they did not matchwith the names given.   No positive breakdown by nationality of the remaining hostageswas possible, due to discrepancies between lists released by IRNAand by the airline's offices in Bangkok.</TEXT></DOC>
