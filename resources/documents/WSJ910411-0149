One you did not mention was the allies' readiness andhow Soviet briefings helped prepare the allied armed forcesfor such an overwhelming victory.   The Soviet Union warned the U.S. that it would not be soeasy to fight Iraq's ground forces, which were well-trained,tested by fire and obedient. The Americans drew the necessaryconclusions from our warning.</LP><TEXT>   Possessing a six-to-one superiority in air strength, theAmericans carried out an air-ground operation that wascarefully planned and repeatedly tested during exercises inthe past eight to 10 years. The classic scenario is that, ifthere is approximate parity between the warring sides, thisoperation should begin with active air raids lasting for fiveto seven days, to be followed by offensive actions by groundforces.   Since the coalition forces were not threatened from thesea or the air, nothing interfered with their intentions.That is why the air-strike part of the operation lasted 40days. By the end of the first month the coalition forces haddestroyed the system of managing the Iraqi state and armedforces.   In the 40 days of air raids the allies destroyed themilitary capacities and civilian economic projects of Iraq,inflicted heavy losses on its ground forces and destroyedtheir morale. On the 41st day the coalition forces begantheir ground operation.   Taking into account the situation in the area and thespecifics of the enemy, the Americans and their allies wereacting expediently. There was no conceivable reason forbeginning the ground operation any sooner, thus inevitablysustaining heavy losses.   I would not speculate that the defeat of Iraq means thedefeat of Soviet hardware and military science. The defeat ofthe U.S. in the Vietnam War did not mean that Americanweapons or its military science were inferior.   The U.S. and other coalition forces in the Gulf were armedwith the latest weaponry, while Iraq was armed mostly by armscreated 10 to 12 years ago. Experts refer, in particular, toT-72 tanks, but I would not call them the latest Sovietweaponry. The MiG-29s are modern aircraft indeed, but Iraqhad only a few of them and they were hardly used.   As far as military strategy goes, we have never trainedthe Iraqi army, and the corps of Soviet specialists in Iraqdid not include a single military adviser. Iraq carried outits combat and operational training in line with the Britishsystem. Iraqi officers were trained in the Soviet Union, butthis hardly means that we trained the Iraqi army.   The developments of any war, in particular such alarge-scale war as in the Gulf, are always closely followedand analyzed by military specialists. I am convinced that theworld will draw lessons from the war in the Gulf, where thelatest weaponry, such as radar-evading aircraft, automatedcontrol systems, high-accuracy munitions, the air-to-surfaceand sea-to-surface cruise missiles and guided aviation bombs,were used.   U.S.S.R. Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov did say at recentparliamentary hearings that we need to improve the structureand equipment of our air-defense system. Mind you, improve,rather than overhaul it completely, as you suggest. However,we should analyze the Persian Gulf War in detail andintroduce corresponding amendments to our militarydevelopment.
