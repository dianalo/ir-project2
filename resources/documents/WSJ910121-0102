Last week, the Military Airlift Command, a part of theDefense Department, said it might need more cargo capacity tomove supplies and equipment in support of Operation DesertStorm.</LP><TEXT>   Under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program, aircraft forcivilian carriers can be commandeered by the military instages. The first phase was activated on Aug. 17, and themilitary acquired the use of 41 aircraft. Under stage two,which was put into effect last week, the government can ask20 civilian carriers for a total of 140 more aircraft.   A Military Airlift Command spokesman at Scott Air ForceBase near here said that of the 181 jets that could be calledup, about 40 would be used to haul cargo.   United Parcel Service of America Inc., Greenwich, Conn.,said that under the second phase of the program it could berequired to make a total of seven jets available for the wareffort.   Federal Express Corp., Memphis, Tenn., said it hascommitted a certain number of jets to the war effort, but itwouldn't be specific. Federal Express has about 200 aircraftin its jet fleet.   A spokesman at Northwest Airlines, a unit of NWA Inc., St.Paul, Minn., said the airline would provide the military withthree Boeing Co. 747 freighters, which are used for its cargobusiness, and three passenger 747s. The spokesman said theairline &quot;isn't expecting any cancellations&quot; as a result ofthe action.   Trans World Airlines made one Lockheed Corp. L-1011available to the military, according to people familiar withthe transaction. TWA, based in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., is expectedto provide additional planes that could include Boeing Co.747s. It isn't clear if the military call for additionalplanes is prompting TWA to cut many of its unprofitableinternational flights, a plan that is expected to beannounced tomorrow, and redeploy the planes as militarycharters.   Pan Am Corp., New York, is negotiating to provide themilitary with two Boeing Co. passenger 747s that can beturned into cargo planes by stripping the jets of its seats,galleys, carpet and other items, people familiar with thecompany said. Those planes were reconfigured so they now haverear cargo doors. The planes apparently would be charteredbecause they aren't included in the pool of planes Pan Am hasavailable for stage two of an airlift. A Pan Am spokeswomanwasn't available for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
