The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were beingbuilt at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.49 million unitslast month after advancing 4.4 percent in June.   Housing starts had dropped a sharp 12.1 percent in May to theslowest pace in three years, and rising mortgage rates were blamed.   The June-July rebound was attributed to stabilized mortgagerates, but last week the Federal Reserve boosted the discount rate,the interest it charges for loans to member banks.   This move was widely interpreted as the opening salvo in arenewed battle by the central bank to drive up interest rates tofight inflation. As a consequence, a variety of other interestrates, including the banks' prime lending rate and mortgage rateshave moved higher.   Fixed-rate mortgages rose to 10.57 percent by the end of lastweek and analysts predicted mortgages would soon top 11 percent.   ``I believe we have seen the peak for housing starts this yearas rising interest rates cut into sales,'' said Richard Peach, aneconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association ofHome Builders, said his organization was so concerned by the Fed'scredit-tightening moves that he asked Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan in a letter for ``a more even-handed approach.''   ``Clearly, the Fed views the housing industry and other interestrate-sensitive sectors of the economy as being sacrificial lambs,''Seiders said.   Sales of homes and other high-priced items usually are the firstto fall off when the Federal Reserve tries to dampen borrowing byraising interest rates.   Michael Sumichrast, an economist and publisher of a constructionindustry newsletter, said that if mortgage rates climb to 11.5percent or higher, it would spell disaster for the housing industry.   He said home sales already have been hurt by big price increasesin many parts of the country.   ``I don't think you can sell houses at 11.5 percent to 12percent mortgage rates in this market because of the priceincreases,'' Sumichrast said.   Analysts say another worrisome sign is that housing permits,considered a good barometer of future activity, fell in July by 5.4percent to an annual rate of 1.41 million units. It was the biggestpermit decline since January.   James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions, said the drop in housing permits probably reflectsbuilders' fears of rising mortgage rates.   He said the impact of higher rates should be moderated by aconsumer shift toward adjustable rate mortgages, which carry alower initial rate.   The July increase stemmed from a big jump in starts ofmulti-family construction, which offset a small decline insingle-family units.   Single-family homes were being built at an annual rate of 1.08million units last month, down 0.8 percent from the June level.   Construction of multi-family units shot up 12.1 percent to anannual rate of 409,000 units following a 6.2 percent decline inJune.   The multi-family sector has been depressed for nearly two yearsbecause of the adverse effects of the 1986 tax law on real estateinvestment, but some analysts said the steep decline in apartmentconstruction finally may have bottomed out.   By region, housing starts were strongest in the Middle West,climbing by 12.1 percent to an annual rate of 296,000 units.Construction rose 9.2 percent in the Northeast to an annual rate of262,000 units.   Construction fell 3.2 percent in the West to an annual rate of368,000 units, and it slumped 1.2 percent in the South to a rate of563,000 units.   For the first seven months of 1988, housing starts have beenrunning 10.6 percent below the level of the same period in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
