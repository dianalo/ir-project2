(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Donna Rice says she has ``basically losteverything'' since her notorious liaison with former Sen. Gary Hart,and now wears false buck teeth and sunglasses so people won'trecognize her.   ``It's just been real hard,'' the model said Saturday in a speechat the 15th annual Institute on the Ethics of Journalism atWashington and Lee University. ``I do live in a state of having towatch my every move. ... Imagine the kind of person you most dislikeand think of people thinking of you as that kind of person.''   Ms. Rice blamed her predicament on irresponsible reporters,although she noted that some journalists maintained professionalconduct. She said she agreed to appear at the seminar only becauseshe hoped to help others avoid similar experiences.   ``I basically lost everything I had worked for all of my life,''she said _ her reputation and credibility as well as her livelihood.   Ms. Rice said she has tried to stay out of the public spotlightafter being ``basically a fugitive for months. ... a prisoner ofperception.''   She said she is recognized frequently in public, and has tried tohide her appearance by pulling her hair back.   In addition, she added. ``I have a disguise. I have buck teeththat I put on. They cost me 80 bucks. You guys want to see?''   When the audience said yes, Ms. Rice donned a pair of glasses,bent over and inserted the false teeth. She stood upright, lookinglike quite a different person.   ``I hope,'' she said, ``time will eventually take care of all ofthis.''   Ms. Rice's liaison with Hart destroyed Hart's bid for the 1988Democratic presidential nomination. Hart withdrew from the race inMay 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
