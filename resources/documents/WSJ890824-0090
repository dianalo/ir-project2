Wellman also will retire about $179 million of Fiber Industries debt and $20 million of Fiber's preferred stock. Wellman plans to fund the deal by issuing $115 million of common stock and paying with bank debt and its own cash.    The transaction is subject to clearance by regulators and a vote by shareholders of closely held Fiber Industries, which is based in Charlotte, N.C. Wellman said, however, that it has obtained enough proxies from Fiber's holders to approve the transaction. The companies expect to close the transaction within 90 days.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Wellman shares rose $1.50 to $29.375.    Thomas M. Duff, president and chief executive officer of Wellman, called the proposed acquisition of Fiber Industries &quot;a natural fit in that they service the parts of the polyester-fiber market that we don't.&quot; For example, both companies make polyester staple, but Wellman's is used in carpet and in fillings for pillows and comforters, while that of Fiber Industries is blended with cotton for sheets, upholstery and apparel.    Wellman estimates that between 20% and 25% of the Fiber Industries product line can be made using recycled plastic, including plastic derived from consumer recycling programs. Wellman has agreements to buy plastic from recycling programs run by, among other entities, Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., the Houston waste-management company. In 1988, Wellman recycled more than 350 million pounds of plastic and fiber.    Fiber Industries was formed through a 1988 leveraged buy-out of assets from Hoechst Celanese Corp., a subsidiary of West Germany's Hoechst AG. </TEXT></DOC>
