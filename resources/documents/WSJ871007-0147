The body won't have any decision-making or regulatory powers but is designed to &quot;maximize the safety of the operation of nuclear power stations by exchanging information, encouraging comparison and stimulating emulation&quot; between utilities the world over, said Lord Marshall of Goring, the chairman of Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board and of yesterday's meeting, at which 140 utilities were represented.    No specific measures were adopted at the close of the two-day meeting, but first steps are likely to include the setting up of a common data base, participants said.    As it has at other nuclear safety meetings since the disaster at its Chernobyl nuclear reactor last year, the Soviet Union openly endorsed the idea of increased cooperation on safety matters.    In announcing the agreement in principle to set up the organization, participants made clear they aren't seeking to duplicate the work of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations-affiliated agency that groups countries at a government level to formulate common safety standards. Instead, they said, the body would complement the IAEA by leading to a faster exchange of technical information between utilities without going through government channels.    Officials said the new body should be operating within a year, and will have headquarters either in London or in Vienna. </TEXT></DOC>
