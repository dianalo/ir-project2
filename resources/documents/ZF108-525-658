 He returned to Bell in February 1986 and rejoined Telecom Canada thisspring.andM;He spoke to Computing Canada editor Martin Slofstra at Bell Canada's officein Toronto.andM;Telecom CanadaandM;Ottawa-based Telecom Canada is the association of Canada's majortelecommunications companies: AGT, Bell Canada, B.C.andP;  Tel, Island Tel(P.E.I), Manitoba Telephone System, Maritime Tel andamp; Tel, NBTel, NewfoundlandTelephone, SaskTel and Telesat Canada.andM;Telecom Canada is managed by a board of directors consisting of one seniorexecutive officer from each of its 10 member companies.andP;  These directorsappoint a full-time president to direct the overall operations of TelecomCanada and to ensure that nationwide policies and programs are compatiblewith plans and activities of the individual members.andM;CC: You began at Bell Canada and have had a number of assignments.andP;  Whichhave you liked the best and why?andM;Farrell: I guess I can honestly say that I really can't recall an assignmentat Bell or Telecom Canada that I really didn't like.andP;  If you're looking at achallenge, I think probably the job in regulatory was the more challengingbecause of the time period, which was 1972 to about 1980.andP;  I do recall inthose times we were faced with rampant inflation in the country and almostannual visits to the regulator to try and improve our earnings position.andP;  Sothat was a very trying time, very difficult time, but a very challenging andvery interesting assignment.andM;Marketing and sales is always great to be associated with.andP;  There's a lot ofhype and there's a lot of activity and innovation and the people in thosefunctions generally seem to display a higher degree of involvement,motivation in terms of wanting to make things move.andP;  So that was a greatassignment.andP;  But Telecom Canada I believe will probably turn out to be one ofthe most interesting.andM;CC: The recent inauguration of your national fibre optic network I think is avery significant milestone.andP;  Why?andM;Farrell: When I'm asked that question, I like to go back a little bit.andP;  Itwill be 60 years in 1991 since we formed Telecom Canada.andP;  When we formedTelecom Canada, most of our services to western Canada went through theUnited States.andP;  So we formed Telecom Canada -- at that time it was called theTrans Canada Telephone System -- to build and construct facilities in Canada.andM;The next major milestone was the construction of the microwave system.andP;  Atthe time, the people in Telecom Canada had to have a fair amount of vision,in my opinion, because it wasn't clear as to what that great capacity thatbecame available would be used for.andP;  But within 10 years, we had to build asecond one.andM;In the '70s, the pressure on industry was to come forward with services thatmet the needs of the computer industry.andP;  So we introduced Dataroute and thenDatapac.andP;  Now as we turn into the '80s, you will see that long-distancetraffic in the latter part of the '80s was growing 15 to 20 per cent peryear.andP;  Just tremendous.andP;  And an increase in demand for data services of allkinds, on-line, banking, you name it.andM;We saw, first of all, that the analogue technology that had served us so wellwas fast becoming a way of the past in the sense that it wouldn't meet futureneeds effectively as digital.andP;  In 1975 and 1976, Telecom Canada membercompanies decided to go digital.andP;  That was a very significant milestone.andP;  Atthat time we were looking clearly at fibre.andP;  But fibre to us was maybe five,six years away ...andP;  in the intervening years, we went digital radio.andM;About 1985, we came to the conclusion that as we saw growth rates developingover the '90s and into the turn of the century ...andP;  that we would have tohave a facility there that was readily expandable and the obvious choice wasfibre.andP;  So in April of 1985 we made that decision.andP;  Our plan was to have theinitial system in service by about the middle of 1991.andP;  And as you now see,we beat that by almost a year, or a little better than a year.andM;In some cross sections, for example, Toronto to Montreal, we're in asituation where we have to now start building the second Telecom Canada fibrenetwork in order to meet demand.andM;CC: Is the intention to link more metropolitan centres?andM;Farrell: It'll probably surprise you, that if you went into Edmonton orCalgary today you would probably find that most of the central offices thereare interconnected with fibre.andP;  The same is true in Toronto, Ottawa,Montreal, likely Vancouver as well.andP;  In other words, fibre is an integralpart of the infrastructure that's in place today.andM;It would also surprise you probably to know that by the end of 1991 orthereabouts, Telecom Canada will be, probably be 100 per cent digital in itsswitching, and probably close to 90 per cent in its transmission.andM;CC: When does this transformation in the network to all digital extend to thebusiness user?andM;Farrell: I will speak for a company I know well.andP;  Bell Canada, at the end of1989, was at about 47 per cent digital capability.andP;  In other words, of allthe switching they had, they're about 47 per cent.andP;  The objective that Bellhas is to be essentially digital by 1995.andP;  When I say essentially, read 90per cent.andM;I expect that the same type of objectives have been set in all the telecomcompanies and in fact some of them may achieve it earlier than Bell.andM;CC: What will that mean to the services offered?andM;Farrell: There's tremendously increased functionality when you go to digital.andO;Generally speaking, a lot of the services are software-based or have a largecomponent of software.andP;  This provides greater flexibility in introducing andproviding new services.andM;CC: It looks like the telecom technology infrastructure is going in place,but the regulatory infrastructure in Canada is not.andP;  Should we be movingfaster on this front?andM;Farrell: I really hope that we don't repeat what they did in the U.S.andP;  Westarted to work on telecom legislation ...andP;  it is now 16 years later and westill have no legislation.andP;  Where it's going to end up is difficult to say atthe moment, but I do hope that we get to a situation some time in the not toodistant future where there is indeed a consensus on what the regulatoryframework and legislative framework that we're going to be operating under isgoing to be.andP;  I think most companies would be very concerned if we ended upwith dual regulation.andP;  In other words, one part of the business regulated byone body, and another part by another body.andM;So hopefully it will sort itself out.andP;  We've been at it 16 years, hopefullyin the next year or two ...andP;  reasonable minds will prevail.andM;CC: I think that people have trouble understanding what Telecom Canada is allabout.andP;  It's not a typical corporate structure at all.andM;Farrell: No, it's not.andM;CC: It's probably a changing thing.andP;  It depends on the time and the issues ofthe day.andP;  It's not a static thing?andM;Farrell: That's right.andM;CC: So where is it going?andM;Farrell: Where's it going?andP;  A lot will depend on telecommunicationslegislation, what that will entail.andP;  It will also depend, I think, to a largedegree on what happens if, Rogers and CNCP (now Unitel), for example, file(for long distance) and if there is a decision made.andM;This will clearly force us to think out how we want to change, or if we haveto change in that type of environment.andP;  My expectation is that we would haveto change.andP;  But for the moment I think that the proof of the success ofTelecom relates to the success that we have in telecommunications in thiscountry.andM;When you look back on the first microwave system, when you look back atDataroute, when you look back at Datapac, when you look at Envoy, when youlook at iNet ...andP;  you look at the decision to go digital across the country,you look at the fibre decision, you look at the Megaroute, Megaplan,Megastream decisions.andP;  For an organization to have that success in anenvironment where you have 10 members, where you require unanimous vote to besuccessful, I think, speaks well for how successful Telecom Canada was.andM;CC: What would you want the profile of Telecom Canada to be for the next twoor three years.andP;  What kind of image should it have, more of a background roleor should it be at the front?andM;Farrell: You will continue to see Telecom Canada collectively again, thecollective Telecom Canada making tremendous yards in respect to technologyevolution, continuing our thrust on digital, continuing our thrust to makesure that we have the capability to maintain the confidence of our customers.andM;So from a Telecom Canada perspective I think you'll continue to see more andmore demonstrating that we are the leader in telecommunications in thiscountry.andP;  Maybe it's time to put your trust again back in thetelecommunications industry.andP;  They've done pretty well for the past 120years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
