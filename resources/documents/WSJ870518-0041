Political analysts blamed the results on party disunity over recent Soviet nuclear-arms proposals. Mr. Kohl said the arms issue, as well as agricultural policy, hurt his party. In recent weeks, West Germany has come out in favor of reducing agricultural surpluses and costly subsidies to farmers.    The Christian Democrats, known by the acronym CDU, failed to win an absolute majority of the vote in Rhineland-Palatinate for the first time in 40 years. A coalition there with the small Free Democratic Party, or FDP, is now practically a foregone conclusion.    The CDU fell to 45.1% of the vote in Rhineland-Palatinate, from 51.9% in 1983. The Social Democratic Party received 38.8%, compared with 39.6% four years ago, and the Free Democrats garnered 7.3%, up from 3.5%.    The Social Democrats, meanwhile, won a majority of the vote in the city-state of Hamburg, their traditional stronghold.    The incumbent Social Democrats, or SPD, won 45%, a strong recovery from the 41.7% they won in the November election that resulted in a deadlock with the opposition Christian Democrats.    The Christian Democrats took 40.5% of the Hamburg vote, down from 41.9% in November, while the liberal Free Democrats jumped to 6.6% from 4.8%.    By winning more than the 5% of the vote needed for representation in state government, the liberal FDP in Hamburg is now able to form a coalition with the Social Democrats. If this were to take place, it would be the first such coalition since the two parties teamed up on a national level in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during the chancellorship of Social Democrat Helmut Schmidt. It would be a political anomaly in a country where the Free Democrats form a coalition on the national level with the Christian Democrats. </TEXT></DOC>
