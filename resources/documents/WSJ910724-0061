The practice, however, should be disclosed to customerswhen they open accounts with securities firms andperiodically thereafter, the report said.</LP><TEXT>   Led by former Securities and Exchange Commission ChairmanDavid S. Ruder, the six-month study of so-called payments fororder flows responds to a proposal by the Midwest StockExchange to expand SEC regulation of such cash payments.Critics charge that the payments are siphoning businesss awayfrom the exchanges to off-exchange dealers and may ultimatelyraise investors' trading costs.   The study focused only on dealers who put together smallorders from individual customers and offer brokers cashpayments for these orders. It didn't look at the practiceamong dealers competing for big trades from institutionalinvestors.   Payments for order flows take many forms, including cashpayments by dealers of one cent to two cents a share for somestock trades; the &quot;swapping&quot; of order flows, or reciprocalagreements in which market-making companies send business toone another; routing trades to exchanges that offer discountsand other advantages, such as free services; and&quot;soft-dollar&quot; payments such as research materials and tradingservices. The report concluded that cash payments aren'tsubstantially different from other kinds of incentives.   Proponents say such payments increase competition amongdealers and ultimately hold down investors' costs. &quot;Customersget faster and more efficient executions,&quot; said Bernard L.Madoff, chairman of a securities firm that bears his name andis heavily involved in making payments to brokers in returnfor customer orders.   But critics say any cost savings should be directly passedon to customers. &quot;The money paid by market-makers tobrokerage firms should be passed on to customers penny forpenny,&quot; said Craig Long, general counsel of the Midwestexchange in Chicago. There's such confusion among dealersabout the practice, Mr. Long said, that the Midwest exchangeappealed to the SEC to give the industry some guidance.   The Midwest exchange, whose members say they are losingbusiness to off-exchange dealers because of the practice,also wants the SEC to require brokers to disclose thepayments in their confirmations of trades to customers. Butthe NASD report stopped short of recommending such frequentdisclosure, which it said would be administrativelydifficult.   In an interview, Mr. Ruder said he was &quot;startled todiscover the wide variety of practices that are carried outby virtually all parts of the industry,&quot; ranging from cashpayments to providing trading services for brokers.   &quot;The effect on investors,&quot; Mr. Ruder added, &quot;is that thatultimately the cost of execution {of a trade} for aparticular broker is decreased.&quot; Interviews with numerouscompanies indicated that brokers in turn held down theircosts to investors, he said. But he conceded that thecommittee had no way to measure whether those costs had beenpassed on to customers.</TEXT></DOC>
