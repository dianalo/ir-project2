The crowd filesinto the movie theater, buzzing in anticipation over &quot;DickTracy.&quot; The lights dim. All eyes turn to the screen. And then-- commercials for Diet Coke and American Express.   What's wrong with this picture?</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is a Walt Disney release. That's the sameDisney that trumpeted its new policy, as of March, to bantheaters from running ads before its pictures. Yet here atthe Hampton Arts theater in New York, and at dozens of othertheaters owned by Cineplex Odeon across North America,commercials run before every showing of the Disney flick. Adsair before Disney's &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot; too. In all, CineplexOdeon is showing Disney films on 170 of its more than 1,550screens, and isn't banning ads on any of them.   Disney and its competitor Warner Bros., which has asimilar ad-ban policy for its films, are finding that grandproclamations are one thing, but enforcing an ad ban in movietheaters is something else altogether. The problem is thattheater chains such as Cineplex Odeon have long-runningcontracts with advertisers, contracts that will last formonths or even years to come. &quot;We can't force people to breakcontracts,&quot; says a Disney spokeswoman, and &quot;we've got to playsome Cineplex houses because there's so many of them.&quot;   The upshot: the Disney and Warner ad bans may not looklike bans at all to the average man on the street.   Cineplex isn't the only chain showing ads before Disneyand Warner pictures. Cobb Theaters, a Southern chain based inBirmingham, Ala., with 300 screens, is doing it as well.Cobb, too, had pre-existing agreements with advertisers. ButCineplex, with over 1,550 screens, is the largest playerrunning the ads. Aside from the commercials it runs beforevarious Disney releases, it also allows ads before the TimeWarner films it is showing on some 230 screens, including&quot;Gremlins II&quot; and &quot;Driving Miss Daisy.&quot;   The ads promise to be around for a long while. Aspokeswoman for Cineplex, based in Toronto, declines to sayhow long the theater chain's contracts with advertisers run,but says: &quot;There certainly is some time to go on certaincontracts. We aren't talking about something that woulddisappear almost immediately.&quot; Advertisers say such contractstypically run several years. Cobb executives declined tocomment.   The Disney spokeswoman says a number of other theaterowners were able to renegotiate agreements with advertisersand to pull ads from Disney releases. For those that arestill running ads because of pre-existing contracts, thespokeswoman says Disney hopes that the contracts won't berenewed. &quot;We would hope the theaters think twice aboutshowing advertisements at all,&quot; she says. Warner executivescouldn't be reached.   Advertisers, though, say they have no plans to leave showbusiness, not as long as they can still see their ads on thesilver screen. Their contracts with such chains as Cineplexhave put them in a position where they barely have to thinkabout the Disney and Warner ad bans. &quot;Right now,&quot; says aCoca-Cola spokesman, &quot;we have to view it for us as businessas usual.&quot;   Although he won't speculate on what will happen afterCoke's contract with Cineplex expires, the spokesman says:&quot;As long as theater owners provide us an opportunity toadvertise in their chains, we will continue to evaluate thatand take advantage of it. We view theater advertising as aneffective form of advertising.&quot;   The Cineplex spokeswoman declined to comment on how thechain will entice such current advertisers as AmericanExpress, Coke and the Los Angeles Times to stay on aftertheir contracts expire, if Disney and Warner films are nolonger part of the ad package. The movie chain is faced witha touchy situation.   &quot;We have good relationships with all the studios,including those who have said they're opposed to screenadvertising, and we intend to continue those good relations,so we will accommodate things they feel firmly about,&quot; thespokeswoman says. But, she adds, &quot;Obviously, we have adifference of opinion. Cineplex believes {screen advertising}is appropriate and can be entertaining.&quot;   ---   RJR's `Mr. Fit' Ads                                                                                                          R.J. Reynolds Tobacco agreed not to run ads that,according to the Federal Trade Commission, misrepresented thefindings of a government study on smoking.   In 1986, R.J. Reynolds, a unit of RJR Nabisco, ran aseries of print ads, one of which discussed a study funded bythe National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. The ad claimedthat the institute's so-called &quot;Mr. Fit&quot; study providedscientific evidence that smoking isn't as hazardous as thepublic had been led to believe.   In a complaint filed in June 1986, the FTC claimed thatthe ads misrepresented the study's findings. The FTC saidthat R.J. Reynolds, among other things, failed to disclosethat the men in the study who quit smoking had asignificantly lower rate of heart disease than men whocontinued to smoke.   Under the settlement, R.J. Reynolds agreed not tomisrepresent in future ads the purpose or results of thestudy. A spokeswoman for the company said that R.J. Reynoldsstill believes that the ad didn't distort the report'sfindings. But she added that the company agreed to thesettlement because of the length and the cost of thelitigation.   &quot;We decided to accept the settlement and put the matterbehind us,&quot; she said.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
