The technologyprevents the growth of marine life on the surfaces of vessels and structuresin contact with ocean waters. Scope: This grant will aid in the further development of a patented techniquefor application of long-lined copper alloy claddings to prevent the foulingof undersea surfaces with marine growth. The objectives to be achievedinclude: the selection and testing of bond coat (electrically insulatinglayer between strucutre and copper alloy protective coat) materials forsteel, fiberglass, concrete and wood; optimize coating applicaion equipmentto operate at production levels over large surfaces; develop ``in-mold''process for applying coatings to fiberglass hulls during production; improvingbond coating application methods; evaluation of improved coatings and techniques;analysis of potential markets. The probability of attaining these objectivesis very high as several years have been spent by the personnel involvedin this project in the development of the invention to its current position.Eligibility: Based on receipt of an unsolicited application, eligibilityof this award is being limited to Copperlock, Inc. Mr. Alexander A. Bosna,CEO of Copperlock, the inventor, has 30 years experience in manufacturingresearch and development, including nuclear, robotics and aerospace organizations.The inventor and his partners hold the basis patents on this coating process.It has been determined that this project has high technical merit, whichwill not only result in substantial energy savings but will also reducethe number of ships required to perform a given level of fleet operationsby reducing maintenance requirements and thereby increase their availability.The term of this grant shall be two years from the effective date of award.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>U.S. Department of Energy, Officeof Procurement Operations, Attn: Rosemarie H.
