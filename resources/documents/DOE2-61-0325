Includingreplacements and retrofits, the residential market is approaching one-millionheat pumps per year, or approximately three-quarters of the country'sheat pump sales. The quantity installed and average efficiency are increasingdespite the dramatic decline in world oil prices, but penetration hasfallen slightly after a period of steady growth. Installations typicallyuse air-to-air, dual-mode (heating and cooling), electrically-poweredheat pumps with heating capacities of 6-12 kW. The equipment used, marketsituation, and outlook for these energy saving, economic, and environmentallyattractive systems are discussed. Factors influencing the unique statusof heat pumps in the United States, including climate and energy prices,are briefly addressed.</TEXT></DOC>
