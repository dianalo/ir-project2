The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said theearly morning push was aimed at showing the Front's fighting muscleto the rightist party about to assume the presidency.   Preliminary reports gathered from the army, rebels and civiliansources indicated at least 34 soldiers and 20 rebels were killed orwounded in six of the towns. Others reported no casualties.   The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said the drive wascalled ``Everyone Against Arena in the Fight for Peace.''   Arena is the Spanish acronym for the right-wing RepublicanNationalist Alliance. Arena President-elect Alfredo Cristiani is totake office on June 1.   The rebels say an Arena government will mean wider polarizationin war-torn El Salvador and a resurgence in violent repression ofpolitical opponents.   The rebels say the armed forces and Arena are targeting leftistsympathizers in a campaign of searches, assassinations and arrests.   Nidia Diaz, a commander of the Front, claimed at a newsconference in Managua, capital of neighboring Nicaragua, thatguerrillas killed or wounded 67 Salvadoran army officers andenlisted men in all, but gave no breakdown.   The attacks were meant to show ``the FMLN could attack variouspoints simultaneously and use different forces and methods ofcombat,'' she said.   She said guerrillas also blew up power lines and carried outother acts of sabotage.   Sources said attacks damaged at least two telecommunicationsoffices, two coffee-processing plants, a gasoline station, sixhomes and several electricity poles and towers.   An armed forces communique said three soldiers were killed andseven wounded in the heaviest fighting, a four-hour clash inTejutepeque, 37 miles northeast of San Salvador.   It said an intercepted rebel radio transmission indicated 20rebels were killed or wounded in fighting Wednesday.   The rebels fired mortars at 3rd Infantry Brigade headquarters inSan Miguel, 85 miles east of San Salvador, hitting a gasolinestorage facility, the armed forces said. About 2,800 gallons offuel burned.   Mortar shells fell in open areas and no casualties or furtherdamage were reported, the communique said.   Five homes were damaged when rebels directed mortar fire againsta civilian defense post in Aguilares, 20 miles north of SanSalvador, it said.
