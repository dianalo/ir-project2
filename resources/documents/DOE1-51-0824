It is a process oriented language,which embodies dataflow synchronization and guarded-command indeterminacyas its basic control mechanisms. The paper outlines the basic conceptsand definition of the language, and surveys the major programming techniquesthat emerged out of three years of its use. The history of the languagedevelopment, implementation, and applications to date is reviewed. Detailsof the performance of its compiler and the functionality of Logix, isprogramming environment and operating system, are provided.</TEXT></DOC>
