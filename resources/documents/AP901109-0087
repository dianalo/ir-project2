(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``King Kong'' will roar attourists again soon, but the Universal Studios Tour won't fullyrecover for months from an arson fire, officials said.   The sheriff's department Friday said the damage was estimated at$25 million. Tuesday's fire damaged 20 percent of the studio's420-acre backlot.   Dan Slusser, vice president and general manager of UniversalCity Studios, said Thursday it would take six months to rebuild thebacklot.   The ``King Kong'' attraction will re-open in a few days,spokeswoman Joan Bullard said.   Michael J. Huston, a 40-year-old security guard booked forinvestigation of arson, was being held Friday in lieu of $1 millionbail.   Lt. Ken Chausse, chief of the sheriff's department arson unit,said investigators were still sifting through the lot for physicalevidence.   ``We have strong admissions from (Huston), but you can haveanybody come up and tell you they did something,'' Chausse said.``You have to corroborate it, or it doesn't mean anything.''   Huston's mother, Debra Dragusica, said he told her Thursday thathe was responsible.   ``He says his mind switched off,'' she said. ``He says it wasn'thim when he did it. ... When he realized what he did, he ran to gethelp.''   Robert Dragusica, who said he is Huston's half brother, saidHuston was innocent. But he did say Huston had been mentallydisabled since serving in Vietnam in 1969.   The backlot was used to film such productions as ``Lady Singsthe Blues,'' ``Dirty Harry,'' the ``Back to the Future'' films,Michael Jackson's ``Moonwalker'' and ``Streets of Fire.''   About a dozen movies and television shows are now looking forreplacement filming locations, Slusser said.   Stock analysts said a proposed $9 billion merger between MCAInc., Universal's parent company, and Matsushita IndustrialElectric Co. would not be influenced by the fire. MCA said the firelosses, estimated at about $20 million, are covered by insurance.</TEXT></DOC>
