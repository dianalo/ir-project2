Conference sources said the political system that had given theChristians, especially Maronite Catholics, most government postscontinued to be the focus today of the closed-door talks among 63deputies.   The legislators, under the auspices of the Arab League, havebeen discussing since Saturday a proposed blueprint for a unifiedgovernment, one that would give Moslems an equal say.   The old covenant, in force since independence from France in1943, gave greater power to Christians. It gave the premier's postto the Sunni Moslems and the Parliament speakership to the ShiiteMoslems.   Maronites, then the majority of the population, held thepresidency and dominated the government, army, Parliament andjudiciary.   Moslems now make up 55 percent of the population of 4 million.   Under the proposed new system, jobs will be filled on ``merit,''rather than sectarian basis.   The Parliamentarians agreed on Tuesday to expand the 99-memberParliament to ensure equal distribution of seats between Christiansand Moslems.   Initially, an Arab League committee charged with mediating asettlement in Lebanon had proposed that the number be increased to128.   But the conference sources, insisting on anonymity, said theparliamentarians agreed Tuesday to add only nine more seats to thepresent chamber, giving them all to the Moslems to make them equalto the Christians.   However, no agreement was reported in the debate overpresidential powers, which Moslems want curtailed to give theMoslem premiers and house speakers a wider role in thedecision-making process.   The Arab League committee is made up of officials from SaudiArabia, Morocco and Algeria. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saudal-Faisal has attended the sessions, often intervening to defuseheated arguments.   ``To abolish political factionalism is easier said than done,''one deputy said, requesting anonymity. ``It indeed is an issue tooexplosive for the parliamentarians to handle without prior consentof the warlords,'' whose militias control the streets of Lebanonafter government authority has been eroded by 14 years of civil war.   Two of these militia chiefs, Walid Jumblatt, a Druse, and NabihBerri, a Shiite, flew to Iran this week where they criticized theTaif meetings, indicating they would not endorse any accord.   ``The deputies may well agree on a new formula, but the test ofimplementation will certainly prove more difficult. The Maronitesare not going to go down willingly,'' he said, alluding to theLebanese Forces coalition of right-wing Christian militias.   The Lebanese Forces have not openly vetoed the reforms demandedby Moslems as the basis for a settlement of the civil war.   But they support the Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun,who opposes completing any political reforms until Syrian agrees toa timetable for withdrawing its troops in Lebanon.   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab Leaguepeacekeeping mandate, but Aoun says it has lost its credibilitybecause it fought alongside Moslems in the civil war.   Aoun and the Syrians fought bloody artillery duels for sixmonths before a cease-fire mediated by an Arab League committee onLebanon took hold 11 days ago. The 14-year conflict has killed150,000 people.   The Parliament meetings in Taif were not expected to produce afinal charter, but a blueprint to be ratified in a session inBeirut tentatively scheduled for Oct. 21.</TEXT></DOC>
