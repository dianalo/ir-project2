That's what the Federal Communications Commission, some public interest groups and even members of Congress will try to determine this summer.    The issue has erupted over the proposed sale of Taft Broadcasting Co. to a partnership headed by reclusive Cincinnati investor Carl H. Lindner Jr. Action for Children's Television, a Boston-based lobby, and the Moreland-Portland (Ore.) Listeners Association urged the FCC in a petition to prevent the sale. The public interest groups cited Mr. Lindner's past troubles with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    In 1976 and again in 1979 Mr. Lindner was charged by the SEC with violating anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of federal securities laws. Both times, he consented to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations.    &quot;We want to ensure that broadcasters are trustworthy, and Carl Lindner has had problems when it comes to holding the public's trust,&quot; contends Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television. &quot;We're not saying he should not get the stations, but there should be a hearing to see if he's been rehabilitated.&quot;    Mr. Lindner, who seldom responds to inquiries from the news media, could not be reached for comment.    In the petition, the public interest groups say that Mr. Lindner's history of alleged misconduct indicates that he might not uphold his obligations as a broadcaster. His constant refusals to speak up, even when inquiries concern serious community and labor issues, suggests that he &quot;feels no obligations to engender himself of the public trust,&quot; said Andrew J. Schwartzman, an attorney for Media Access Project, a Washington, D.C., law firm that is representing the public interest groups.    Meanwhile, other groups and individuals also question Mr. Lindner's suitability as a broadcaster, citing his long-held disdain for the media. Although he is chairman of three public corporations, American Financial Corp., United Brands Co. and Penn Central Corp., he shuns interviews and seldom comments about business, civic or other matters. Even when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed that a United Brands subsidiary pay a $690,000 fine related to allegations that it covered up serious worker injuries, Mr. Lindner remained mum.    The petition also represents the first major challenge of a policy change that redefines the type of character the FCC requires of someone who holds a broadcast license.    The agency scrutinizes character under the premise that applicants with good character are more likely to meet the lofty standards ascribed to broadcasters. In theory, broadcasters are expected to act as public trustees: In return for a license to use the public airwaves to generate profits, they are asked to provide accurate news and to fulfill certain other obligations.    The FCC is required to assess the financial, legal and character qualifications of potential broadcast owners before a license can be granted. Prior to the character policy change in December 1985, the FCC considered whether applicants had been convicted of any crimes or accused of violating federal laws. Such offenses could prompt the commission to hold hearings to determine whether the applicant was fit to be a broadcaster. In practice, the FCC rarely denied applications for character flaws even when an investigative hearing was held.    Under the revised policy, such issues are raised only when the applicant has had federally adjudicated cases of fraud, perjury or misconduct directly related to the broadcasting industry. Consent decrees are ignored.    The FCC changed the policy after concluding that the previous standards were too broad and sometimes encouraged the filing of frivolous petitions. &quot;It was getting to the point where a guy with traffic violations was forced to go before a hearing,&quot; says a former commissioner. Such infractions &quot;are irrelevent when judging whether a person will deal truthfully with the commission and comply with FCC rules and policies.&quot;    The character policy change was part of a sweeping series of moves to deregulate broadcast ownership that began in 1981 when Mark Fowler, a disk jockey turned lawyer, became chairman of the FCC. During his six-year tenure, he encouraged the FCC to &quot;stop playing God&quot; with broadcast ownership and let the public and the marketplace dictate who controls the airwaves. In recent years, the FCC has eliminated guidelines that limit advertising time, dropped a rule that required radio and television stations to be held at least three years before they could be sold and increased the number of stations one owner can hold to 36 from 21. The FCC also is seeking to repeal the Fairness Doctrine, which requires broadcasters to air both sides of a controversial issue.    Now, public interest groups and members of Congress are seeking to restore some of those policies. Rep. Al Swift (D., Wash.), ranking Democrat on the Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, has sponsored bills that would reinstate the three-year ownership rule and revise the license renewal procedure.    Mr. Schwartzman, the Media Access lawyer, argues that the FCC is &quot;mandated by law&quot; to make inquiries that would determine whether Mr. Lindner is qualified to &quot;become one of the nation's largest holders of broadcast licenses.&quot; Taft Broadcasting operates seven television and 15 radio stations, entertainment and production companies and has interests in several cable television operations.    At issue are the two SEC cases in the 1970s. The SEC charged in 1976 that Mr. Lindner manipulated the price of Warner Communications Inc. stock, which he planned to sell back to Warner. He was required by the consent decree to establish a $1.1 million reserve fund to cover possible judgments against the company as a result of the stock activities.    Three years later, Mr. Lindner was charged with violating federal securities laws for failing to inform American Financial shareholders that he and others received favorable financial treatment from the company. He was directed to pay $1.4 million to the company to settle the claims.    In addition, shortly after the consent decree was reached in the American Financial case, the FCC raised questions about Mr. Lindner's 5% stake in Gannett Co., a Washington, D.C.-based publishing and broadcasting concern. In a strongly worded statement, the commission said, &quot;We do view with concern the past pattern of behavior of Mr. Lindner.&quot; But it ultimately dropped the matter because Mr. Lindner's stake in the company was small and he didn't hold a management position at Gannett.    Officials at American Financial have said that Mr. Lindner has no plans to change Taft. Nevertheless, a recent editorial in the weekly Cincinnati Business Courier raised concerns that, with the ownership change, Taft &quot;may eventually take on the characteristics of the parent.&quot; The editorial declared that, &quot;A 'no comment' stance may be understandable from the owner of an insurance, banking, food or electronics business, but for the owner of a company that helps shape public opinion a fortress mentality is not desirable.&quot;    Signs have emerged suggesting that Mr. Lindner's penchant for privacy already is affecting Taft. News directors and station managers cite a new policy that forbids them from discussing certain issues with other members of the press. &quot;I strongly disagree with the policy,&quot; said one station manager. He speculated that with a secretive owner, the station's news staff could have difficulty convincing sources to be open.    If, as expected, the FCC doesn't schedule a hearing, Media Access said it plans to ask a federal appeals court to force such a hearing.    ---                CARL LINDNER'S HOLDINGS    Companies                                    Percentage    United Brands Co., New York                     86.0%    FMI Financial Corp., Cincinnati                 72.0*    Provident Bancorp., Cincinnati                  64.0*    Charter Co., Jacksonville, Fla.                 50.5    Mission Insurance Group Inc., Los Angeles       49.0    Circle K Corp., Phoenix, Ariz.                  34.8    Republic American Corp., Encino, Calif.         34.0    DWG Corp., Atlanta                              32.0    Penn Central Corp., Cincinnati                  28.0    Taft Broadcasting Co., Cincinnati               16.5    National Convenience Stores, Inc., Houston      15.8    Columbia Sandamp;L, Beverly Hills, Calif.             14.1    Aaron Spelling Productions Inc., Los Angeles    10.2    Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., Cincinnati      6.9   *Lindner family only   Note: Lindner invests independently and through AmericanFinancial Corp.
