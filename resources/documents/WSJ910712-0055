Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/12/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved an omnibus anti-crimebill that would expand the federal death penalty, curbdeath-row appeals and impose a mandatory five-day waitingperiod on handgun purchases.   The legislation, which passed 71-26, reflects a politicalbidding war in which the White House and lawmakers from bothparties tried to top each other in appearing &quot;tough oncrime.&quot; The bill, which next goes to the House, includesnumerous provisions creating stiff new penalties fordrug-trafficking and crimes involving guns.</LP><TEXT>   The White House has indicated general approval of theSenate bill. President Bush has said he would considersigning gun-control legislation if Congress attaches it to apackage of sufficiently severe new sanctions for gun crimesand limits on prisoners' rights. The Senate bill includes athree-year ban on the manufacture of 14 types ofmilitary-style semiautomatic weapons.   The House already has passed a seven-day variation of thehandgun waiting period but hasn't voted on the other measuresapproved by the Senate. After a similarly passionate debatelast year, House and Senate conferees ended up eliminatingthe types of provisions at the core of the current omnibusbill.   Gun control dominated the Senate's almost four weeks ofdeliberation and procedural maneuvering on the bill. Gunproponents, backed by the National Rifle Association, failedin repeated efforts to eliminate the handgun waiting period,which is designed to give police time to check criminalrecords. The Senate combined the waiting period with fundingto improve and computerize such records with the aim ofeventually establishing a system that could check a gunbuyer's background instantly at the time of purchase.   With opposition from only a handful of liberals, theSenate added 51 federal offenses that would be punishable byexecution. Most of the crimes covered, however, are rare,such as the assassination of a Supreme Court justice orcausing a death by wrecking a train.   In contrast, a provision sponsored by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato(R., N.Y.) would allow capital punishment for committingmurder with a gun. If the D'Amato measure became law, federalprosecutors theoretically could seek to convict and executethousands of alleged murderers each year. Sen. D'Amato alsosucceeded in adding provisions that would give federalofficials broad authority to prosecute other gun-relatedcrimes, which now fall under state and local jurisdiction.   Republicans succeeded in stripping from the bill a legaldefense against the death penalty based on the claim thatcapital punishment is imposed in a racially discriminatoryfashion.   The legislation includes sharp curbs proposed by PresidentBush on federal appeals by inmates challenging theirconvictions and sentences. Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.),architect of much of the rest of the bill, argued that thelimits would effectively eliminate such appeals to thefederal courts, which are known as habeas corpus petitions.   The Senate authorized more than $3 billion in newanti-crime spending, but separate congressional action wouldbe needed to make that money available to be spent. Overallbudget constraints probably will preclude such spending inthe fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
