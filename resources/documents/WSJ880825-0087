Profits are slipping below plans, especially in the Midwest corn belt and spring wheat areas of the Upper Plains states. In a double misfortune, many of the farmers who started the year in the weakest financial shape are in the areas most hurt by the drought.    &quot;We're seeing a loading up of financial problems,&quot; says Gregory Hanson, an Agriculture Department economist.    Before the unusually early and intense drought, the number of imperiled U.S. farm banks had shrunk steadily from a peak of 230 on June 30, 1986. According to the latest Federal Reserve Board data compiled by Veribanc Inc., a Woburn, Mass., consulting concern, the number of farm banks with problem loans exceeding capital -- a leading indicator of potential failure -- fell to 122 on March 31 from 126 on Dec. 31, 1987. A farm bank is one that has 25% or more of its loans to farmers.    But the drought that has hit since then is forcing banks in some farm states to swallow charges against earnings as they rebuild loan loss reserves that had been allowed to shrink last winter, when the farm crisis seemed to be fading.    At the same time, many banks are seeing demand for new loans evaporate. Many farmers dropped plans to buy land or new equipment as the drought intensified. In Sidney, Mont., a handful of stores closed this summer as farmers retrenched, says Jim Selman, First United Bank of Sidney assistant vice president. &quot;It's terrible,&quot; he says.    Few bankers have a clear idea yet of how many farmers will miss loan payments as they pocket less money from their shrunken crops. The details of the $3.9 billion federal drought relief package signed by President Reagan this month won't be completed until this fall. According to some estimates, an eligible farmer who lost 30% of a corn crop to the drought would receive about two-thirds of the normal income under the relief program.    Nonetheless, state officials in Iowa are guessing that farmers will have trouble making payments on roughly 20% of loans, many of which have been restructured in the past few years. Officials in Minnesota, which began mediating debt disputes between farmers and creditors in 1986, are concerned that the state's caseload will surge next spring.    Some states are worried that banks will clamp down on lending to farmers hit by the drought. Last month, South Dakota began partially guaranteeing loans made to buy cattle.    Despite the problems, however, economists don't expect an increase in farm bank failures, which hit a post-Depression record of 75 last year. Before the drought, many farm banks had managed to eliminate most of their farm crisis-era bad loans and had built up liquidity. What's more, the potential loan losses of rural banks have been limited by the government's policy of advancing farmers spring planting money, once a big business for many banks.    Bank earnings are even expected to increase in some regions. In the central and southern Plains, for example, much of the winter wheat crop was harvested in June, before the drought intensified. Nebraska has received adequate rains this summer. &quot;Kansas bankers feel good,&quot; said Mark Drabenstott, an economist at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank. </TEXT></DOC>
