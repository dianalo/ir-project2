A gaze-operated computer keyboard that lets paralyzed people usetheir eyes and brain waves to write, talk, move their wheelchairsand turn on appliances also could be commercially available to thedisabled within a few years, the researchers said.   Details of several new computerized devices to assist thedisabled were outlined during the annual meeting of the AmericanAssociation for the Advancement of Science. So were some problems.   Voice synthesizers and braille word displays gave blind computerusers ``full competitiveness within most educational and employmentsettings'' during the 1980s, said Lawrence Scadden, director of theElectronic Industries Foundation's Rehabilitation Engineering Centerin Washington.   But ``increased use of graphically displayed information maythreaten newly acquired independence and productivity for theseindividuals,'' he added.   Unlike the code used to transmit letters and numbers, the methodby which sophisticated computers ``draw'' pictures, charts and eventext on display screens isn't readily converted into braille or acomputer's synthesized voice, said Scadden, who is blind.   He urged the industry to develop machines to let the blind hearor feel such information.   Dexter, a five-fingered robot hand to help deaf-blind people``hear,'' may be commercially available next year for under $5,500,said co-developer Deborah Gilden, with the Smith-KettlewellRehabilitation Engineer Center in San Francisco.   The mechanical hand ``is able to translate informationoriginating from a keyboard, modem, computer or closed-caption TVdecoder to hand and finger motions that correspond to the one-handfingerspelling alphabet,'' said David Jaffe of the Palo AltoVeterans Administration Medical Center, which helped develop Dexter.   A deaf person ``listens'' to Dexter by placing his or her fingersagainst the mechanical fingers. Each of the robot hand's positionsrepresent a single letter.   Stanford University engineer James Kramer said he is seeking amanufacturer for his ``talking glove,'' which will cost about $1,500and let deaf-mute and deaf-mute-blind people speak by using theirfingers to spell.   Wires lead from the glove to a microcomputer, which match theperson's finger motions to letters of the alphabet. A speechsynthesizer converts the letters to spoken words that come from asmall speaker hanging from a deaf person's neck, Kramer said.   Hearing people can respond by typing on a hand-held computerkeyboard, which then can send the words either into a brailledisplay worn on a blind-deaf-mute person's belt or into a smalldisplay screen a sighted deaf-mute can wear like a wristwatch.   Smith-Kettlewell's Erich Sutter developed the gaze-controlledkeyboard for people who are so paralyzed or disabled they can movelittle more than their eyes.   With electrodes attached to or implanted in the scalp, theparalyzed person stares at a screen that is divided into rectangles,each containing a letter, number or common word. As the paralyzedperson stares at the desired letter or word, a variety of tinylights also flash in the rectangle. For every letter or word, thelights create a unique electrical wave pattern in the person's brain.   The electrodes feed those brain waves to a computer, whichconverts them back into words, which then can be displayed on ascreen, synthesized into a voice, or used to move a wheelchair, diala phone or turn on lights, radio, television and heat, Gilden said.   Jaffe said a new wheelchair lets the paralyzed steer by makingslight head motions that are detected by an ultrasounddistance-measuring machine. The disabled person's head becomes likethe joystick control on a video game, he said, adding the $4,000wheelchair should be in production soon.   A new federal law will provide limited money to help somedisabled people acquire such high-tech machines, but they and theirrelatives must work for programs to make the devices more widelyavailable, said Jacquelyn Brand of the National Special EducationAlliance.</TEXT></DOC>
