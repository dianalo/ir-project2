The sale price included $95 million in cash and $365 million of notes due in six months, and secured by a letter of credit from the home-products maker.    First City declined to value the stock involved in the transaction.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, First City shares closed unchanged at $13.375.    As previously reported, Nutone, a home-products concern that originally was a door-chime maker, and Yale, a lock maker that has expanded into electronic security products, represented about 71% of First City's revenue of $474.3 million last year. For 1986, First City had a net loss of $9.5 million.    First City, which is 69% owned by Canadian investors William and Samuel Belzberg, also has businesses making apparel fasteners, building residential housing and investing in securities. It acquired Nutone and Yale along with the Hamilton Beach appliance operations when it bought Stamford, Conn.-based Scovill Inc. in early 1985 for about $540 million.    Last year, First City sold Hamilton Beach to Glen Dimplex Ltd., an Irish concern, for $103.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
