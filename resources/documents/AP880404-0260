ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   F.W. Woolworth Co. said Monday it receivednotice that Dart Group Corp. intends to acquire a substantialamount of the retailer's stock in what could be the beginning of atakeover bid for the nation's 13th largest retailer.   Woolworth, which built its reputation in the five-and-dime storebusiness before expanding into specialty retailing, responded toDart's move with the adoption by its board of a ``poison-pill''takeover defense.   The retailer said in a statement it was notified a partnershipcontrolled by Dart Chairman Herbert Haft had filed with federalantitrust officials documents indicating the group intended toacquire $15 million or more of Woolworth's stock.   Less than a month ago, the Haft family dropped a $1.03 billionbid for Stop andamp; Shop Cos. after their target agreed to a leveragedbuyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   Wall Street expected the Hafts to make a bid for Woolworth. Theretailer's stock shot up $8.25 to $53.50 in late afternoon on theNew York Stock Exchange.   The Hafts have said in the past they are serious about buyingand operating a retailer, but doubts linger about their intentions.Dart's string of unsuccessful but profitable takeover attempts inrecent years has given Herbert Haft and his son, Dart PresidentRobert Haft, reputations as corporate raiders.   Robert Haft was not available when a reporter called for commentMonday.   A source close to Dart confirmed that the partnership had made afiling on March 18 with the federal government in compliance withthe Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act.   Under the act, parties seeking to acquire a substantial stake ina company must notify the government of their intentions.   The source declined to say whether a takeover bid was in theoffing.   Karen Sack, a retail industry analyst with Standard andamp; Poor'sCorp., said Woolworth has been mentioned recently as a possibletarget for a takeover attempt.   Edward Johnson, an analyst with Prescott Ball andamp; Turben Inc.,said Wall Street believes Woolworth stock would be worth about $67under a buyout. The low stock price and Woolworth's low-rentalproperties and successful specialty store formats make it anattractive target, he said.   If the Hafts do make a bid, Woolworth would be expected to fightit. In the company's statement, it said the retailer's board hadadopted the poison pill ``to deter coercive or unfair takeovertactics and to prevent an acquirer from gaining control of thecompany without offering a fair price to all shareholders.''   The pill adopted by Woolworth's board would allow the company'sshareholders to buy its stock at a steep discount. It would go intoeffect when a person or group acquires 20 percent of Woolworth'sstock, on the commencement of a tender offer for 30 percent or moreof the retailer's shares, or when an adverse party acquires atleast 15 percent of the company's stock.   Joseph Carroll, a Woolworth spokesman, declined to comment whenasked what steps the company might take if and when the Hafts makea takeover bid.   Johnson said the company might consider going private under aleveraged buyout.   Other options open to the retailer include making an acquisitionitself or spinning off one of its units to shareholders.   Woolworth, founded 109 years ago by Frank W. Woolworth as afive-and-dime store, has grown to an empire of more than 6,300general merchandise and specialty stores worldwide. In recentyears, the company has shifted its focus from its well-knownWoolworth stores to its specialty operations, which include Kinneyshoe stores and Foot Locker and Lady Foot Locker athletic footwearstores.   Ms. Sack said Woolworth ``has done very well'' as a result ofits restructuring.   For the fiscal year ended Jan. 30, Woolworth earned $251 millionon sales of $7.14 billion.   Before their unsuccessful attempt at taking over Stop andamp; Shop,the Hafts began a hostile bid for Dayton Hudson Corp. that theywere forced to end when the stock market crashed. Their previoustargets include Supermarkets General Corp. and Safeway Stores Inc.   Dart has made hundreds of millions of dollars from theirtakeover forays by selling their stock at a higher price after thecompanies successfully defended themselves.   Johnson said that if the Hafts are serious about buying aretailer, Woolworth, with its specialty operations, would be anappropriate target. Dart operates two specialty chains, Crown Booksand Trak Auto.</TEXT></DOC>
