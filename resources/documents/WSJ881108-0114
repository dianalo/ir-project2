Founded in 1938, the firm originally was known for its growth-stock orientation. But in a drastic switch in the early 1980s, the firm's current chief executive officer, Christina Seix, turned more of its resources to bond investing.    The 38-year-old Ms. Seix has gone on to win considerable respect among institutional investors. More than 80% of the $5 billion her firm manages comes from large clients such as the pension funds of Kraft Inc. and Westinghouse Electric Corp.    MacKay-Shields is &quot;in our top quarter of money managers,&quot; says an enthusiastic Tom Harrison, an investment manager at the Memphis, Tenn., public employees' retirement fund. Since January 1981, MacKay-Shields says its bond accounts have returned an average 14.6% a year. That's appreciably ahead of the 13.5% average yearly gain in the Shearson Lehman Brothers government-corporate bond index.    When it comes to mutual funds, MacKay-Shields is a newcomer. It launched its Mainstay family of funds only in 1986, after being acquired by New York Life Insurance Co. The notion is that New York Life's 11,000 field agents can sell the money management expertise of Ms. Seix and her colleagues to the masses.    Starting from zero, MacKay-Shields has built up about $800 million of mutual fund assets. &quot;Our agents are selling another $20 million a month,&quot; says George Bundschuh, vice chairman of New York Life.    MacKay-Shields's high-yield bond mutual fund is a standout this year, with a total return of 13.7% through Oct. 20, compared with a 7.5% return for the average bond fund. Its stock fund is up 17.1% for the same period, slightly outpacing Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.    Some of MacKay-Shields's niftiest skills, though, aren't so easy to transfer to the mutual fund area. The firm has repeatedly gained profits for pension clients by clever trading of mortgage-backed securities.    But mutual fund investors would rather buy government-bond funds with the perceived safety of U.S. Treasury obligations. So MacKay-Shields has compromised by offering a Government Plus fund that can invest part of its assets in mortgage securities.    So far this year, the $400 million Government Plus fund has lagged slightly behind the Shearson Lehman index. Through Oct. 20, it was up 5.7%.    The fund competes with a burden common among mutual funds -- a 1% annual fee to cover marketing expenses. Such fees, known as 12b-1s, help make mutual funds profitable for those who manage them, but eat into investors' returns.    Lately, more money management firms have been trying to excel at both the pension and mutual fund businesses. Big fund complexes such as Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price have picked up institutional accounts, though these remain a small part of their business. Meanwhile, well-known institutional money managers such as Fred Alger of New York and State Street Research of Boston have rolled out mutual funds, though they haven't always been able to attract big assets.    For its part, New York Life believes MacKay-Shields can be a winner in all categories. &quot;Their fixed-income side grew to prominence because of Chris Seix's spectacular record on active bond management, and their equity side is starting to roll again,&quot; says New York Life's Mr. Bundschuh. &quot;We're happy with the business.&quot;    Until 1981, MacKay-Shields didn't even have a bond management department. It began in January that year with just one person, Ms. Seix, a mathematician by training. &quot;I remember the first year being on the road talking to prospective clients and having to rush to a pay phone to execute a trade in our portfolio,&quot; Ms. Seix recalls. Since then, though, she has built up a 12-member fixed-income team, including a co-manager of bond investing with her, Ravi Akhoury.    In bonds, MacKay-Shields uses 80% of its portfolio to match the bond market's average maturity range, while looking for extra little yield advantages in areas such as mortgage securities. With the final 20% of assets, MacKay-Shields alternates between short-term Treasury bills and longterm Treasury issues. It uses a nine-part mathematical model to predict where interest rates are headed and then buys whatever is appropriate. Bonds do better if rates fall; bills fare better if rates rise.    Ms. Seix is bearish on bonds for the immediate future. Among her reasons: the boom in takeover proposals is heating up credit demand, she says, leading to upward pressure on rates. But farther down the road, she says, &quot;We're terribly bullish&quot; that interest rates could drop significantly, aiding bond prices. </TEXT></DOC>
