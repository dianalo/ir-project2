Only a small amount of effort has gone into reducing theamount of energy consumed in the production of buildings. This paperdeals with one aspect of this area of study, economic forces which impactbuilding material selection. It focuses on the economic argument thatconventional market forces or pricing will automatically lead to theselection of less energy intensive building systems. The argument isbased on the idea that as energy gets scarcer, its price will increase,and the increases in price will in turn be reflected in the prices ofmaterials and products. Less energy intensive products would be substitutedfor more energy intensive products by market forces alone. This paperexamines the validity of this argument and finds that market forces doinfluence the selection of building materials, but the effect is oppositethe intuitive argument. Building systems with higher energy intensitieswill most likely replace those with lower energy intensities. Four factors,which largely invalidate the market force argument, are discussed. Therelationship between a material's cost and its energy intensity, andthe relationship of &quot;value&quot; added and energy added in the productionsequence, are also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
