JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Interior Department said Thursday it isconsidering additional trade restrictions on African ivory but aconservation group said the need is for an immediate ban.   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, saying he was ``outraged overthe illegal poaching of African elephants'' for their ivory tusks,said the Bush administration was ``on the verge'' of expandingimport controls.   But he said that ``no solution to the elephant problem can beeffective without the full participation of the African nationsthat have elephants'' and other nations where demand for ivory isconsiderable.   Lujan said the United States already prohibits ivory importsfrom more than 70 nations, but that does not seem to be enough tocurtail large amounts of ivory from coming into this countrythrough commercial trade channels or illegally.   ``We have reason to believe that some of this ivory is fromillegal trading and that the commercial trading is out ofcontrol,'' said Lujan in a statement.   An Interior spokesman, Steve Goldstein, said one action being``looked at very seriously'' is expanding the ivory import ban tonations such as Japan where ivory does not originate, but wherebusinesses are heavily involved in the importing and exporting ofivory and ivory products.   According to the department, the African elephant has declinedin numbers from about 1.5 million a decade ago to fewer than700,000 because of an onslaught by poachers interested only in theivory tusks. Conservation groups suggest the number could be closerto 400,000.   An international convention scheduled for October is likely toreach agreement on procedures aimed at permanently banninginternational commercial trading of African elephant ivory.   But officials of several conservation groups said Thursday at anews conference that the expectation of such an action by 102nations in October could launch ``an elephant holocaust acrossAfrica'' by poachers seeking to beat the ban.   ``It is absolutely vital that the United States and the Europeancommunity immediately ban ivory imports until internationalagreement can be reached in October,'' said Russell Train, chairmanof the World Wildlife Fund. He urged ivory importers in Hong Kongand Japan, where much of the ivory is made into jewelry and otheritems, to take similar action.   David Western, director of Wildlife Conservation International,said that industrial nations also should provide emergency funds tohelp African governments ``cope with the expected surge in poachingand smuggling'' of elephant ivory prior to the Convention onInternational Trade in Endangered Species.   The conference is expected to place the African elephant into amore protective category which would prohibit elephants from beingkilled for their ivory.   According to the conservation groups, the volume of ivoryexported from Africa has steadily increased from 300 tons a year inthe 1950s to more than 800 tons a year in recent years. The volumehas dropped somewhat during the last two years, butconservationists attribute that largely to the rapidly dwindlingsupply of elephants.   In a related matter, Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., urged Lujan ina letter Thursday to immediately ban ivory imports and send ``avery strong signal about our commitment to the protection of theAfrican elephant.''</TEXT></DOC>
