The company's fiber optics system for telecommunications has been promoted as a potentially low-cost alternative to systems being developed by giants such as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. In a report in August, J.A. Cunningham, an analyst for First Boston Corp., estimated that Raychem could install its system at 33% to 70% of the cost of an ATandamp;T system, and could generate $5 billion of sales by 1992.    The decline in earnings drove Raychem's stock sharply lower yesterday. The shares fell $3.25 to close at $36 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. About 1.3 million shares changed hands.    For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the diversified maker of industrial and electrical parts posted net income of $5.8 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with $16.6 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 4.1% to $235.3 million from $226.1 million. The Sept. 30, 1987 quarter's results included a $2.5 million pretax gain from the sale of two product lines.    Raychem attributed most of the decline in its earnings to the costs associated with the Raynet unit, which is developing the fiber optics system. Raynet posted a pretax loss of $10.7 million for the quarter, compared with pretax profit of $4.4 million a year earlier. Raychem said it doesn't expect Raynet to post any substantial sales for at least two years.    Raychem said it is &quot;exploring financing approaches&quot; that may offset Raynet's development expenses. An unregulated unit of BellSouth Corp. already owns an 8% interest in an overseas subsidiary of Raynet, convertible into a 5% interest in Raynet, if regulators permit such domestic investments by telephone concerns in the future.    BellSouth invested $25 million, giving Raynet an indicated capitalization of $500 million. A Raychem spokesman said that some other companies have expressed interest in buying equity interests in Raynet, and that Raychem could also sell research and development contracts to interested parties.    Partly offsetting the news of the poor results, Raychem said both orders and shipments increased during the quarter, with orders increasing at a faster rate than shipments. Orders from the telecommunications market showed the greatest increase, followed by orders from industrial and electronics businesses.    Despite the drop in earnings, Raychem increased its quarterly dividend to eight cents a share from six cents a share. The new dividend is payable Dec. 7 to stock of record Nov. 9.    For the year ended June 30, Raychem reported net of $125.3 million, or $3.69 a share, up 70% from year-earlier net. Sales rose 16% to $1.09 billion.    (Revised Oct. 31, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
