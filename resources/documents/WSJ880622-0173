Barefoot children sit on the dirt floor of their schoolroom. Old men dressed in rags gather idly under the thorn trees. Women trudge to the nearest water, more than a mile away.    Just look inside Salvador Cossa's grain bin, the residents tell you. One year ago, the 41-year-old village leader didn't even have a bin; he had no seeds to plant and, thus, no grain to store. Today, the bin, made of reeds and perched on stilts to keep the animals and insects away, is half full. By the end of the year, if the weather is kind, it may even be overflowing.    &quot;We're getting there,&quot; says Mr. Cossa, a broad smile cracking his weathered face. &quot;One day we'll be able to feed ourselves.&quot;    One day -- those words haunt this land of immense suffering. One day, say the peasant farmers, the 14-year bush war against anti-government rebels will be over. One day drought will disappear from our land. One day the economy will recover. One day we will be able to feed ourselves.    A return visit to this dusty village after a year's absence shows how elusive that one day is. Mr. Cossa's grain bin may be filling up, but just last month another 100 peasants -- looking for food and security -- moved into the village to escape the fighting in the countryside. Self-sufficiency slipped further into the future.    Mozambique keeps struggling, but its disaster keeps getting worse. &quot;What we're trying to do is implement an economic recovery program in a situation of war,&quot; says Eneas da Conceicao Comiche, the governor of the national bank, the Bank of Mozambique. It is a task akin to scooping water out of a sinking boat.    For instance, in the past 18 months the local currency has been devalued three times and the prices of consumer goods -- including basic foodstuffs -- have risen as much as 500%. This has successfully curtailed the black market and revived the local retail sector: fruits and vegetables are abundant at the central market in the capital, Maputo, and once-empty stores are filling up their shelves.    But, in the same 18-month period, salaries have risen only about 125%. &quot;Now that the stores are full, no one has the money to buy anything,&quot; says a man window-shopping on a downtown street.    Mr. Comiche acknowledges this contradiction of simultaneous advances and retreats. He notes that salaries have been increased by an average 4,500 metacais ($10) per family per month, which will pay for the allowance of rationed goods for a family of three. &quot;But of course,&quot; says Mr. Comiche, &quot;our families have more than three people.&quot;    The same dilemma vexes the nation as a whole. The recovery program, relying on an injection of much-needed imports, managed to boost industrial production 18%, exports 22% and the gross domestic product 4% last year. Still, the country's condition continues to deteriorate. At a recent United Nations-sponsored emergency conference, Mozambique asked for $380 million in relief aid, about $50 million more than it received last year. The government says six million people, out of a total population of 14 million, have been cut off from adequate food supplies by the war.    With 80% of the population living off subsistence agriculture, the peasant farmers, many of them dislocated by the war, are the main target of government recovery efforts. The government has been distributing seeds and farm tools, along with relief food, in an effort to make the farmers self-sufficient again. &quot;The emergency program is only for temporary relief, to give a new life,&quot; says the central banker. &quot;It can only be a temporary situation. We don't want to rely on foreign aid.&quot;    The 1,000 residents of Village Seventh of September (named for the day in 1974 when the Portuguese colonial rulers agreed to give the country its independence) are working hard to make good on this new life. A year ago, they were barely surviving. Running from rebel raids in the countryside, they carved their village out of the bush 25 miles west of Maputo. They now had protection, but they didn't have any food. Drought was strangling the surrounding countryside, and they didn't have anything to plant, anyway. It was a rare day when a parcel of relief food reached the village.    When planting season came in the spring, along with some rain, the village was visited by a government official bearing hoes, machetes and blade sharpeners, as well as seeds for corn, beans, sweet potatoes and peanuts. These were incentives, the official visitor said, to get them planting again. And plant they did. Land was divided into plots, and the village elders made sure everyone did their share.    &quot;Early in the morning we go around to see that the people aren't getting lazy,&quot; says Mr. Cossa. &quot;If you're not sick, old or blind, there is no excuse for not working.&quot;    Today, Mr. Cossa proudly reports, Village Seventh of September is halfway to self-sufficiency. Relief parcels still arrive every month or so, but that food is kept aside until there is nothing left to eat. </TEXT></DOC>
