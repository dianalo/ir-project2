The higherproduction would make up a large part of the roughly fourmillion barrels a day of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil removed fromthe world market by United Nations sanctions following Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait.   Under such an OPEC agreement, Venezuela could increase itsproduction by up to 500,000 barrels a day from its currentOPEC quota of 1.95 million barrels a day. &quot;OPEC must maintainits cohesion,&quot; said Mr. Perez.   Mr. Perez said a steep price rise resulting from a failureto replace the lost production would be &quot;disastrous&quot; for theworld economy, and especially for the economies of developingcountries.   Venezuela, along with Saudi Arabia, has issued a call foran OPEC meeting to consider a production increase. But asenergy minister Celestino Armas flew to Geneva Saturday tomeet with his Saudi counterpart, only Ecuador and the UnitedArab Emirates had agreed to attend the meeting.   Venezuelan officials said the proposed meeting would beunlikely to produce an agreement on quotas, since severalmember countries are afraid of crossing Iraq. If the meetingfails, then OPEC members who are in a position to increasetheir production -- Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria and theUnited Arab Emirates -- would probably agree among themselvesto temporarily apportion the four million barrels a dayoil-production shortfall until the crisis is over.   The officials, who are anxious to preserve OPEC, said itwould be possible to reassign the shortfall under an OPECregulation that permits re-allotment of quotas that are notbeing used by member nations. At any rate, the issue shouldbe settled this week, the officials said.   Mr. Perez, who has been accused at home and in the U.S. ofwaffling on the issue of raising Venezuelan production,denied that he has been pressured by the U.S. to do so. &quot;TheU.S. attitude towards Venezuela's position has been one offrank gratitude,&quot; Mr. Perez said.   During the interview, Mr. Perez repeatedly emphasized whathe called OPEC's &quot;compromise&quot; to produce 22.5 million barrelsa day of oil for the world market, and the calamitousconsequences for developing nations in particular of anotheroil shock. Mr. Perez said that Venezuela had &quot;unbreakableobligations&quot; to supply the U.S. and Latin America. &quot;Brazilused to get 200,000 barrels a day from Iraq,&quot; he said. &quot;Theyare living from day to day. Venezuela will have to help.&quot;   Mr. Armas, the energy minister, said that while high oilinventories had so far helped cushion the crisis forindustrial countries like Japan, countries like Argentina andBrazil, with small or nonexisting inventories, were fastapproaching a &quot;critical situation.&quot;   Mr. Armas said that most of the projected increase inVenezuelan production would be heavier crudes. That couldcause some marketing and refining headaches: In mostinstances, the refining of heavy crudes provides a higherpercentage of fuel oil, for which Venezuela would have tofind new markets, said a former senior official of Petroleosde Venezuela, the state oil company.   Mr. Armas said that at the beginning of the Gulf crisis,Venezuela had briefly raised production over its OPEC quota&quot;out of nervousness.&quot; But he said the increase sent the wrongsignal to the market and the country was now keeping withinits quota.</TEXT></DOC>
