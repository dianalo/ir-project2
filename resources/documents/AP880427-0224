No Israeli army casualties were reported.   Israeli officials said the increase in cross-border raidsappeared connected with nearly five months of violence in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Documents found on the two dead guerrillas showed they plannedto take hostages and try to exchange them for Arab prisoners heldin Israeli jails, using U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering as anegotiator, a military source said.   Settlements in northern Israel were put on alert during athree-hour search for the guerrillas by foot patrols andhelicopters. Roads were closed and men were told to stand guardwith guns. Women and children were ordered to stay indoors.   On Tuesday, three guerrillas crossed the border at the samespot. They and two soldiers were killed when an army patrol foundthem.   A 14-year-old Palestinian girl died Wednesday of wounds sufferedthe day before when Israeli soldiers opened fire during an Arabprotest in the occupied West Bank, the army and hospital officialssaid.   Her death brought to at least 174 the number of Palestinianskilled since a rebellion began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 Palestinians inthe West Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied since the 1967war. An Israeli soldier and a Jewish settler also have been killed.   The guerrillas crossed the border unnoticed, and it was thetruck driver who alerted troops after running away from theassailants, said the military source, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   While officials say violence in the territories has declined,Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled said on Israel radio: ``There is an increasedeffort on the part of Palestinians to reach northern settlements ... and this is certainly a change.'' He is chief of Israel'snorthern command, in charge of the border area.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin appeared to blame Syria, sayingthat ``the last three attacks (from Lebanon) were carried out outby pro-Syrian PLO groups.''   A joint statement issued in Beirut claimed responsibility forTuesday's raid on behalf of Lebanon Communist Party led by GeorgeHawi and George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine, a pro-Syrian faction of the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   But the military source said the guerrillas were members of thepro-Syrian Palestine Liberation Front, headed by Mohammed Abbas,who was blamed for the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruiseship in which an American was killed.   Also on Wednesday, an army inquiry said the teen-age Jewishsettler who died April 6 in a clash with Palestinians in the WestBank town of Beita was killed by a bullet fired by an Israeliguarding her hiking party.   It blamed Beita residents for provoking the incident, in whichtwo Palestinians also were killed and the guard was seriouslywounded.   According to the army report on the incursion, two guerrillasarmed with hand grenades and light weapons crossed the border atmidday Wednesday within yards of the spot where the threePalestinians infiltrated a day earlier.   They attacked truck driver Dan Dahan, 24, near ``Tank Junction''where a rusting ruin of a Soviet tank used by the Syrians in the1967 Middle East war stands as a memorial.   ``Suddenly they fired at me ... and threw a grenade,'' Dahansaid on Israel radio. ``I jumped from the truck and it started toroll down and I hid behind it. They fired at me while I crawled onthe ground ... and I ran into the bushes.''   Dahan was shot in the hand and wounded in the back by grenadeshrapnel.   Zvi Yuval, a 37-year-old civilian from Kibbutz Senir about threemiles south of the border, was among those who stood guard. He toldThe Associated Press he heard constant gunfire during the search,including shots fired from helicopters.   ``We fear there will be more attacks this summer,'' he said.``That's when the vegetation is like a jungle,'' providing coverfor guerrillas.   Border crossings often cause an uproar in security-consciousIsrael. After Tuesday's penetration, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamirsought to reassure Israelis by declaring on Israel radio: ``We arepaying a high price ... but the border is impenetrable forterrorists. So it is and so it will be.''   The pro-Syrian Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestineclaimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack.</TEXT></DOC>
