The agency said it agreed to buy $12 million of preferred stock, a $5 million loan participation and as much as $6 million in other assets from Bank of Santa Fe in Santa Fe. In addition, a banking investor agreed to inject $7 million in capital to the bank.    The actions followed notification by James Stretz, director of the New Mexico Financial Institutions Division, that the bank was in danger of failing.    The FDIC decided that the assistance package would cost less than liquidating the bank. In return for its help, the FDIC will get a portion of earnings and stock appreciation if the bank prospers, and a share of recoveries from certain assets. </TEXT></DOC>
