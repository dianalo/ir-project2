MCA said the fall in per-share profit results from theissuance of about 10 million shares in connection with theacquisition last March of Geffen Co., which MCA says cost it$435 million.</LP><TEXT>   Separately, MCA said it agreed to acquire a minority stakein Harvey Comics Entertainment. The Santa Monica, Calif.,company publishes cartoon characters including Casper theFriendly Ghost and Richie Rich.   Terms weren't disclosed, but closely held Harvey waspurchased last year by an investor group led by 25-year-oldJeffrey A. Montgomery for $8 million; Mr. Montgomery is theson of Great Western Financial Corp. Chairman JamesMontgomery. MCA's stake is said by individuals close to thetransaction to be in the 20%-30% range. MCA's UniversalPictures is in talks to develop a film based on the RichieRich character and the company said it would attempt toexploit Harvey's characters in film, television, home videoand theme parks.   MCA revenue increased about 15% to $949.9 million from$828.3 million. Revenue from theatrical films provided thebiggest boost, resulting from the successful film releases&quot;Bird on a Wire&quot; and &quot;Back to the Future III&quot; and from homevideo revenue.   Operating profit was down slightly, primarily owing toMCA's share of a $6 million loss registered by Cineplex OdeonCo., the movie theater chain of which MCA owns a 49% stake.This was somewhat offset by lower interest expenses owing tolower rates.   Theme park revenue was down, partly because last year'squarter saw the opening of the popular &quot;Earthquake&quot;attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood. Results fromUniversal Studios Florida, which opened in June and isgetting off to a slow start because two of the majorattractions haven't opened as planned, weren't included inthe second quarter results. Operating profit improved at thecompany's New York-area television station, WWOR, and its50%-owned USA cable television network, but pay televisionsuffered from the lack of a contract for certain new films.Those films have been sold directly to CBS Inc.'s televisionnetwork and the ensuing revenue will show up next quarter, acompany spokesman said.   &quot;There's a lot to look forward at this company,&quot; saidanalyst Lisbeth Barron of S.G. Warburg andamp; Co., citing improvedperformance in the music division when the Geffen acquisitiontakes hold next year, and the Florida theme park. She said,&quot;it's got the most potential of any company in theentertainment industry&quot; and called the stock an &quot;attractivebuy within a few points of 50 {dollars a share}.&quot;   MCA shares closed yesterday at $52.25, up $1.25.</TEXT></DOC>
