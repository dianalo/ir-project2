It is shown that pulse-width limitingunder conditions of pure mode locking is largely due to an excess residualgain, which exceeds the cavity loss level. This effect can be preventedby using a saturable absorbent. This approach has made it possible toreduce the pulse width from 800 fs under pure mode locking to 300 fsunder the combined method without intercavity compression. 10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
