Clearly an accurate methodof assessing ventricular function under conditions of stress in variouscardiac diseases would provide important information that would helpin patient management. Exercise ventriculography using gated blood poolequilibrium technetium studies are widely used, but are limited by spatialresolution and by the foreshortening affects of visualizing the leftventricular chamber in the left anterior oblique view. First pass radionuclidestudies have the added advantage of being able to visualize the ventricularchamber in the anterior or even the right anterior oblique view, butare even more limited by their spatial resolution problems. Several investigationshave shown that digital subtraction angiography produces left ventricularimages with a spatial resolution almost identical to that of conventionalcontrast ventriculography, but without the inherent problems of cardiacarrhythmias, which often limit the assessment of left ventricular function.Because of its ability to accurately delineate wall motion abnormalities,the technique may provide an adequate assessment of global and regionalleft ventricular function after exercise. Digital subtraction angiographymay identify ischemic wall motion abnormalities produced by exercisein patients who already had significant permanent left ventricular damagefrom myocardial infarction.</TEXT></DOC>
