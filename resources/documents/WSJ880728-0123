Savings institutions by any measure remain the dominant source of homeownership credit in the U.S. At year-end 1987, they accounted for 55% of home loans outstanding in the private sector. Mortgages and mortgage-backed securities account for more than 70% of savings institutions' aggregate assets. In the secondary-mortgage market, savings institutions dominate.    No other category of financial institutions comes close to savings institutions in helping meet our country's national priority commitment to homeownership. Nearly two-thirds of all residential units are owner-occupied.    Homeownership has long been a part of the American dream. Its reality forms what John C. Calhoun called stakes in society -- the ballast for a huge and uniquely diverse nation. Savings institutions remain by far the leaders in financing these dreams and making them a reality.    Theo H. Pitt Jr.    Chairman   U.S. League of Savings Institutions   Rocky Mount, N.C.    ---   Your article repeats a fiction that the U.S. League of Savings Institutions &quot;convinced Congress that the industry could solve its own problems for about $5 billion, with the healthy thrifts footing the bill.&quot; Our position focused on the duration of the bonding program before a congressional review of accomplishments, not on the size of the problem.    Since the Treasury Department and the Federal Home Bank Board said the Bank Board could spend only $5 billion a year judiciously to resolve cases, the league contended Congress should authorize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to borrow $5 billion. That amount, together with its other income from our institutions, would give the board money for two years' worth of problem solving, and then the need for additional bonding or other funding could be re-examined. The league did not contend that $5 billion was enough to solve all the problems; no one knew then or knows now how much it will cost to resolve the problem cases. We wanted to avoid the squandering of our capital since it is the savings institutions -- not the taxpayers -- that are paying the principal and interest cost of the bonds.    William B. O'Connell   President   U.S. League of Savings Institutions   Chicago</TEXT></DOC>
