But that may mark the last year Mr. Fireman will be paidin a such a princely fashion. A new employment contract,which began in January and runs for five years, sets hisannual salary at $1 million a year and his bonus -- based onthe company's earnings performance -- at a maxiumum of $1million. Mr. Fireman also has certain options to purchaseReebok stock.</LP><TEXT>   Under his previous, four-year contract, Mr. Firemanreceived a small base salary along with 5% of the company'spretax earnings. That compensation structure dated from theearly 1980s, when Mr. Fireman guided the footwear companythrough its early and rapid growth.   Since 1985, Mr. Fireman has been one of America'shighest-paid executives, with average compensation of $13.6million a year. However, Reebok's growth has slowed over thepast few years.
