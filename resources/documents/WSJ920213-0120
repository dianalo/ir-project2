London shares,repeating the previous day's performance, finished at sessionlows amid dull dealings. Frankfurt stocks, still stuck in aconsolidation phase, closed mixed.   In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index retreated 277.88points or 1.27% Wednesday to 21541.64 in continued lightvolume.</LP><TEXT>   On Thursday in Tokyo, the Nikkei fell 164.65 points fromWednesday's close to end the morning session at 21376.99.   Wednesday's first section volume was estimated at 170million shares, up from 137.5 million Monday, beforeTuesday's national holiday. Losers outnumbered gainers,823-139, with 129 issues unchanged. The Tokyo Stock PriceIndex of all first section issues, which lost 14.48 pointsMonday, fell 18.13, or 1.12%, to 1594.81.   Contributing to shares' declines in Tokyo were continuingconcerns about Japanese political scandals, the possibilityof downward revisions in corporate earnings projections, thedollar's sharp advance overseas on Tuesday and the decline inJapanese government bond prices. The stock market's dropfollowed its failure to absorb a small amount of selling,including some by arbitragers.   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex fell 13.4 points to 2523.7, which also was the intradaylow. The FT 30-stock index edged down 0.9 point to 1963.3.Volume was 448.1 million shares, compared with 432.7 millionshares a day earlier.   Given no news to drive the London market, stock pricesmoved aimlessly. Declines followed Bank of England comments aday earlier, after the market had closed, that the centralbank hadn't yet found signs of British economic recovery andthat a rebound &quot;is proving elusive.&quot; Also, a dull openingWednesday on Wall Street undermined any support for Londonequities.   In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-stock index gave up 4.63 pointsto 1678.92. Rumors of another coup in Russia, later denied byofficials in Moscow, helped damp the German market, whichalso was pressured by Wall Street's mixed to higher close onthe previous day, Tokyo's decline Wednesday and London'smixed to lower showing. The DAX continued to be stuck inrange between 1650 and 1700.   Elsewhere in Europe, trading was again generallylackluster. Madrid shares' gain resulted from expectations offavorable Spanish inflation data and speculation about apossible cut in interest rates; the Russian putsch rumorcaused Madrid stocks to stumble only temporarily. Milanequities fell widely, as speculators bailed out of positionsahead of the end of the February trading account.   Stocks put in a mixed performance across Asia and thePacific. Hong Kong shares' powerful surge more than offsetlosses from the previous session's profit-taking, as localinvestors went bargain-hunting. Profit-taking pushedSingapore shares down. Manila stocks rebounded slightly asbargain-hunting in commercial and industrial issues perked uptrading. Wellington equities firmed, though they retreatedfrom highs as a cautious New Zealand central bank statementon monetary policy damped optimism about interest rates. InSeoul, shares declined for the third consecutive session onworries about rising interest rates and the reduced flow ofcash deposits to securities companies; Seoul market sentimentalso was hurt by rumors that the South Korean governmentwould tighten monetary policy to absorb excess liquidityresulting from the huge release of money to meet demand atthe lunar New Year holiday.   Among corporate developments, in London, Reuters Holdingsadded 1 pence to #11.04 ($19.87).

But Reuters warned that &quot;marketrecovery is not in sight and we expect revenue growth to slowfurther in 1992.&quot; Sales of #1.47 billion represented a 7.1%rise, though this pace was half that of a year earlier. Theannual dividend was increased 13% to 17 pence a share, or onepenny more than analysts had expected.   British Aerospace plunged 12 pence, or 4.3%, to 270 pence($4.86).

In Paris, Chargeurs jumped 55 French francs, or 5%, to1,149 francs ($211.59). The textile, communications andtransportation concern's shares rallied on word from RupertMurdoch's News Corp. of Australia that its financially ailingBritish Sky Broadcasting satellite-feed television affiliateis expected to break even next month and could have aprofitable quarter. Chargeurs is a charter shareholder ofBSkyB and owns a 15.9% stake. Chargeurs also benefited fromnews that control of its unprofitable Delcer sports andleisure-wear textile unit will go to Fincori of Italy throughits SGAT Italia subsidiary, in return for a 35% stake in SGATvalued at 60 million francs ($11 million).
