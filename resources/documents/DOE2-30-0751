<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0751 </DOCNO><TEXT>A sintered Si{sub 3}N{sub 4}-SiO{sub 2}-Y{sub 2}O{sub 3} composition,NASA 6Y, was developed that reached four-point flexural average strength/standarddeviation values of 857/36, 544/33, and 462/59 MPa at room temperature,1200, and 1370 C, respectively. These strengths represented improvementsof 56, 38, and 21 percent over baseline properties at the three testtemperatures. At room temperature the standard deviation was reducedby more than a factor of three. These accomplishments were realized bythe iterative utilization of conventional X-radiography to characterizestructural (density) uniformity as affected by systematic changes inpowder processing and sintering parameters. Accompanying the improvementin mechanical properties was a change in the type of flaw causing failurefrom a pore to a large columnar beta-Si{sub 3}N{sub 4} grain typically40 to 80 microns, 10 to 30 microns wide, and with an aspect ratio of5:1.</TEXT></DOC>
