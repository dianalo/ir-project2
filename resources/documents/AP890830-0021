The practice ``has created a circle of poison'' where some foodtainted by the toxic chemicals is imported into the United States,said Sandra Marquardt, who has followed the issue for theenvironmental group Greenpeace.   Greenpeace cited the practices of the Velsicol Chemical Corp.,which from its plant in Memphis, Tenn., is the world's only producerof the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor.   Both pesticides are banned for agricultural use in the UnitedStates and for virtually all other uses because they were found tocause cancer. They are also banned or severely restricted in 48countries.   Nevertheless, Ms. Marquardt said Tuesday, Velsicol exportednearly 5 million pounds of the pesticides to 25 countries between1987 and the middle of this year. More than 330,000 pounds went toArgentina and another 510,000 pounds to Australia, countries thatimport meat and other products into the United States.   In a statement from company headquarters in Rosemont, Ill.,Velsicol called the Greenpeace report ``grossly inaccurate.''</TEXT><NOTE>Appeals Court OKs Random Drug Tests for Some Army Civilians</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court says the Army maysubject more than 6,500 civilian workers, including law enforcementand aviation personnel, to random drug tests.   The Army in 1986 implemented drug testing for more than 9,000 ofits 450,000 civilian employees.   In a 3-0 decision Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals said 3,700civilian police and guards should face mandatory drug tests becauseof the threat to public safety posed by ``drug-impaired, gun-totingcivilian officers.''   The 2,800 civilians who fly and service the Army's airplanes andhelicopters also should undergo random drug testing due to thepossibly ``calamitous consequences'' of a single drug-related lapse,the appeals court said.   A small group of civilian lab workers don't have to undergomandatory, random testing, said Appeals Court Judge David Sentelle.</TEXT><NOTE>Banking Chairman Will Reopen Probe of Lincoln Sandamp;L</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chairman of the House Banking Committeesays he'll reopen his panel's investigation of the failure ofLincoln Savings and Loan Association, expected to require thegovernment's largest thrift rescue.   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, branded the collapse of the LosAngeles thrift a ``mini-Watergate,'' and said his committee hadsuspended its probe only because of the pressing need to passemergency legislation bailing out the Sandamp;L industry.   The probe is sure to examine political contributions from CharlesH. Keating Jr., chairman of Lincoln's parent company, AmericanContinental Corp. of Phoenix, to five senators who later met withregulators about Lincoln.   They are Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; John Glenn, D-Ohio;Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; and Donald W.Riegle Jr., D-Mich.

Thomas Murley, director of the NRC's office of nuclear reactorregulation, told officials of the Sacramento Municipal UtilityDistrict on Tuesday that uncertainty about the fate of the913-megawatt plant was making it difficult to plan regulatorychanges there.   The NRC must approve any transfer of the utility district'snuclear license to another operator, but it also must approve thevarious regulatory adjustments required if the plant isdecommissioned and dismantled.   David A. Boggs, general manager of the utility district, saidefforts to sell the 15-year-old plant probably will be abandoned ifno agreement is reached by Friday with Quadrex Corp. of Campbell,Calif.   The Rancho Seco station has been closed since June 7, the dayafter utility district residents voted against keeping it running.It was the first time an operating nuclear power plant was closed byvoter initiative.</TEXT></DOC>
