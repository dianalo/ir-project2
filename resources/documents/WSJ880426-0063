But as the Senate prepares to vote its approval, the thing is beginning to look like the man who came to dinner. The suspicion grows that the Members are not so much voting for anything as they are voting to have done with the fat fellow.    We began to suspect that even the members of Washington's antic political household had grown weary of their roles in this legislative farce on reading Senator Byrd's discussion last week of the bill's future.    At issue was the trade bill's fate should Congress fail to override a presidential veto. Some lawmakers felt they'd get a second chance by submitting a &quot;stripped-down&quot; version of the original bill. The flaw in that notion, the Senate Majority Leader pointed out, is that &quot;various Senators would want to put their pet items back in.&quot; We wonder if the bill would cover more than 10 pages if indeed all the &quot;pet items&quot; were actually stripped out.    The trade bill is supposed to be &quot;about&quot; the trade deficit. But in our view the trade bill is mostly about what Washington is about, which is politics. As a national political phenomenon, the trade bill was born Aug. 3, 1985, in East Texas.    Running for a vacant House seat, Democrat Jim Chapman christened trade a &quot;real red, white and blue issue.&quot; He blasted the Republican administration's &quot;unilateral disarmament&quot; in the war with Sony and Volkswagen salesmen. His Republican opponent, Edd Hargett, said, &quot;I don't know what trade policies have to do with bringing jobs to East Texas.&quot; Mr. Hargett lost (by a vote margin of 1.8%) and the &quot;trade issue&quot; entered national political life.    The trade issue died, in our view, on March 5 this year. That was the day presidential primary voters in South Carolina, a textile state everyone had presumed to be a hotbed of protectionism, demolished the protectionist strategies of Richard Gephardt, Bob Dole, Pat Robertson and the textile industry. The big Super Tuesday vote confirmed that, one East Texas race to the contrary, protectionism is anything but a big winner with the voters.    A rational political system would have recognized this reality and moved on to other pursuits. But Washington responds to its own realities, and so has kept the brain-dead trade issue on a respirator. Why?    One reason is omnipresent in the legislative process of modern Washington-PAC money. It is hard to imagine that the trade bill would run to 1,000 pages if the Members weren't doing the town's lobbyists favors in return for PAC contributions. A cynic would suggest that Congress never seriously wanted to pass a trade bill in the first place. Accordingly, the President's veto message would simply say that the process has extracted about all the trade PAC money available for this year's elections, so let's put the the trade issue on the shelf until 1990.    Another reason the trade bill continues to breathe is that big business hasn't opposed it. It's on board not only because it gets some relief from past Washington mistakes such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, but also because the bill's messier provisions will mainly erect costly entry barriers to smaller, up-and-coming competitors.    Finally, the trade issue survives inside the Beltway because that's where the White House is. The White House continues to quote Mr. Reagan as saying he very much wants a trade bill he can sign. So the administration trade drones hit the Hill to be part of the process, shaping subsections into &quot;acceptable&quot; language only they and the lobbyists understand.    The United States is the world's number one economy. Every day of the week, the rest of the world looks to America for economic leadership. This trade bill before the Senate isn't worthy of any country that lays claim to that position of leadership. More than any of the other now fashionable theories of American decline, the passage of this bill will surely indicate that Washington's institutions would rather play pointless political games with each other than do the harder work of a great 20th-century nation -- expanding and integrating the world's economy. What would prove this theory wrong is if someone in that town shows the courage to once and for all pull the plug on the trade issue. </TEXT></DOC>
