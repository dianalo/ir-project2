Dr. James Hansen said the Office of Management and Budget forcedhim to contradict _ within his own prepared statement _ his findingthat a buildup of ``greenhouse effect'' gases would increase thelikelihood of drought.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who questioned Hansen at a subcommitteehearing, said he saw ``a form of scientific fraud'' by theadministration, which has been taking what environmentalistsconsider a go-slow position on dealing with global warming.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that changeshad been made in Hansen's prepared testimony, but he said thescientist had ``never been muzzled.''   The development came two days after it became known that WilliamReilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and otherofficials had been rebuffed by the White House when they suggestedthe U.S. government call for an international convention on globalwarming.   Gore, D-Tenn., chairman of a science subcommittee, commendedHansen for courage, and said that if administration officials``attempt any kind of retribution in return for candor they willhave on their hands the congressional equivalent of World War III.''   Another government scientist, Dr. Jerry D. Mahlman of theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said he had asimilar experience with the budget office in congressionaltestimony he prepared in February.   Mahlman said he successfully fought changes that would have been``embarrassing to me'' in facing his fellow scientists, and toldsenators, ``If we do not have the right to be wrong, we havesquelched the right to be creative.''   At the White House, Fitzwater said that Hansen's writtentestimony, as submitted, represented administration policy. Hecalled the practice of alterations routine, and said the changeswere made by a budget official ``four of five levels down from thetop.''   He said the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationscientist was free to express his own views in answering committeequestions: ``He's never been muzzled. He's free to say whatever hewants.''   Fitzwater said that much disagreement exists among scientists,inside and outside the government, on the global warming issue andsaid that Hansen's original testimony gave the appearance that``there was unanimity within the government on this matter. Wesimply wanted to point out that there wasn't.   ``We thought we were commenting on policy, not scientificevidence,'' Fitzwater said.   Hansen told the committee that it was unlikely scientists wouldalter the conclusions of computer models that greenhouse gaseswould increase drought in low and middle latitudes. But thetestimony also said the computer models were not reliable.   ``Why did you contradict yourself?'' Gore asked Hansen, who thenrelated his confrontation with budget office officials.   ``I did object,'' he said. ``I don't believe the scientificaspects in testimony should be altered. I did try to get them tocompromise. ... I was not successful.''   Hansen said officials also added a sentence that it was unknownwhether the buildup of greenhouse gases was from natural forces orfrom human activities. Hansen and others at the hearing said humanswere primarily responsible by burning fossil fuel, cutting downtropical rain forests and other actions.   ``Every scientist that testified here today ... and everyreputable scientist in the field supports your conclusion this isprimarily a human cause. It's not an act of God. OMB forced you tosay it may ... be just the forces of nature,'' Gore said.   ``They're acting as if they're scared of the truth,'' thesenator added. ``It's a form of scientific fraud by them. ... Theadministration does not want to act. It wants to sit still and donothing.''   The greenhouse effect is said to occur when gases in the earth'satmosphere trap radiant heat near the planet's surface. In additionto natural buildup, scientists say the gases have increased greatlybecause of burning coal, oil, and gas, and destruction of tropicalrain forests.   At a separate hearing Monday, William M. Diefenderfer III,nominated to be OMB's deputy director, told the Senate GovernmentalAffairs Committee that he had no first-hand knowledge of the Hansenchanges, and added that he was told Hansen's protests had notreached the agency's upper echelons.   ``If there was an attempt to alter or change scientific fact orconclusion, it would not be a policy I would support,'' he said.But he defended the agency's right to change a witness' conclusionsif they differed from the president's policies.   Administration officials said Saturday that EPA head Reilly andother government proponents of a greater U.S. leadership role onglobal warming had urged the White House to call _ at aU.N.-sponsored meeting beginning Monday in Geneva _ for aninternational convention on the subject but Chief of Staff JohnSununu had said the idea was premature.   EPA spokesman David Cohen said Saturday of Sununu, ``Basically,he has been extremely supportive and he has said only that he hassome questions that he wants answers.'' Cohen said Reilly alsobelieves the questions ``deserve answers.''</TEXT></DOC>
