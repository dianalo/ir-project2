But continued cautiousness on the part of investors kept the market from making the most of an early advance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which quickly added more than 15 points after the opening, finished with a gain of just 2.85 at 2127.49.    Trading was sluggish as investors awaited the outcome of the election, in which Mr. Bush was generally expected to win over Gov. Michael Dukakis. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to 141,660,000 shares, compared with 133,870,000 Monday, but much of the activity was concentrated in a handful of utility stocks and blue-chip issues.    Broader market averages fared better than the Dow Jones industrials, in contrast to their poorer performance lately. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 1.22 -- equivalent to about a 10-point gain in the 30-stock average -- to 275.15. Also, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index went up 0.97 to 258.61 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.56 to 154.84.    Traders said the market's early strength largely came in reaction to its weakness over the two prior sessions, in which worries about the economy and fears that Mr. Bush's lead might be in jeopardy caused the Dow Jones industrials to lose nearly 46 points. Stocks then pulled back and stalled at midday, attempted another rally in the final hour and faded again at the close.    The initial rally was broad-based, as advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the Big Board by a 3-to-1 margin. Advancers ended the session with a somewhat narrower advantage of 852 to 578.    Traders said the market has some room to respond favorably to a win by Mr. Bush, but added that any advance may amount to little more than a brief, knee-jerk reaction. &quot;The positives of a Bush victory are already figured into the market, with the exception of what it gave up in the last day or two,&quot; said Ernest Rudnet, manager of block trading at Mabon, Nugent andamp; Co.    At best, Mr. Rudnet said, any post-election rally is likely to allow the market to recoup its recent losses and approach the upper end of its year-long trading range. &quot;I would think this election doesn't hold anything very positive for us,&quot; he said.    He added that worries about the economy are likely to prove troublesome for stocks once the impact of the election has passed -- a concern shared by Monte Gordon, research director at Dreyfus Corp.    Before last Friday's report on October unemployment came out stronger than expected, Mr. Gordon said, the market &quot;was just beginning to accept&quot; the idea that economic growth had begun to moderate. &quot;Then when you suddenly get these numbers, people do a 180-degree turn and all of these fears get reignited,&quot; he said.    With the presidential race being decided, Mr. Gordon said he believes the market could pause to assess how the new president will handle the economy, along with the ongoing budget and trade deficits. As a result, he said, the prospect of a Bush victory is &quot;not a matter of 'Hey, we're off to the races' -- not at all.&quot;    Much of the activity in utility stocks was concentrated in Houston Industries and Philadelphia Electric, both of which carry hefty dividend yields and are about to make quarterly payouts. Houston Industries finished unchanged at 29 5/8 and Philadelphia Electric closed unchanged at 20 1/4.    Gulf States Utilities gained 1/2 to 8 1/2 in trading that included a block of 2.2 million shares, or 2% of its shares outstanding. The company attributed the activity in its stock to a recent recommendation by Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, which was involved in the big trade.    Among other active issues:   Union Carbide added 3/8 to 27 1/8 after trading as high as 27 3/4. Heavy volume in the stock Monday led to speculation that the company may spin off one of its three divisions, arrive at a settlement in the Bhopal gas disaster case, or become the target of a $35-a-share takeover offer. The company declined comment.    General Electric, which agreed to sell its semiconductor business to Harris Corp. for $206 million, gained 1 1/8 to 44 3/4. Harris dipped 1/8 to 27 1/4.    Sears Roebuck fell 1 5/8 to 42 1/8 amid continued skepticism that its restructuring plans will bolster its sagging earnings.    McDermott International, which reduced its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share from 45 cents, plummeted 2 7/8 to 14 1/4. The company reported a $29.5 million loss from continuing operations for the second quarter, ended Sept. 30.    Veeco Instruments rose 1 7/8 to 21 3/4, apparently due to renewed optimism about the possibility of a takeover. The stock had lost three points Monday after Veeco disclosed that its talks with an unidentified party about a possible $26-a-share bid had been suspended.    RB Industries gained just 1/4 to 11 despite news that an investor group offered $13 a share for the company, which didn't identify the group any further. The bid topped an earlier offer of $12 a share from another suitor.    The American Stock Exchange Index rose 1.29 to 294.76. Volume totaled 7,640,000 shares.    Fibreboard Corp. rose 2 1/8 to 12 1/4. The company said it reached an agreement with Continental Casualty, one of its primary insurance carriers, on terms of payment for asbestos-related claims.    Entertainment Marketing fell 7/8 to 2 1/8. The company said it expects to report a loss from continuing operations for its third quarter, ended Oct. 31.    Geothermal Resources International added 1/4 to 5 5/8. The company said it entered into a memorandum of understanding to sell a 50% interest in its East Mesa Geothermal Project to Mission Energy for more than $22 million.    Chariot Group rose 1/4 to 5 1/4. The company agreed to sell its Sandusky Plastics unit to Envirodyne Industries for $23.8 million in cash and the assumption of about $3.9 million in debt. </TEXT></DOC>
