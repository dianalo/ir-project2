She was 20 to 100years old, officials said.   Mimi, captured last week off the Maine coast and flown toDetroit, died Sunday in the tank at Carl's Chop House, which paid$320 for the huge lobster.   ``She had quit moving. I picked her up. She still didn't move,''said Barry Hornecker, executive chef at Carl's.   So he chilled and poached Mimi and began making plans for afeast.   ``Mimi was like Elizabeth Taylor. ... She was alwaysbeautiful,'' said Jim Richards, owner of the Long Wharf LobsterCo., which flew the lobster to Detroit.   Although Mimi was a lot bigger than the 1{-pound averagelobster, she wasn't the biggest. Earlier this year, Florida's SeaWorld adopted a 19-pound lobster, whose age was estimated at 100years, from a grocery store in Oklahoma.   The largest known lobster lives in a museum in Maine. It weighs58 pounds and is estimated to be 300 years old.</TEXT></DOC>
