The union members, who were singing and dancing, marched abouttwo miles from a train station to the Kempton Park courthouseoutside Johannesburg before police chased them from the area, saidthe Congress of South African Trade Unions, the nation's largestlabor federation.   At least 18 people suffered injuries that required treatment atJohannesburg Hospital, said federation spokesman Neil Coleman.   Police arrested 20 demonstrators who failed to disperse, butCapt. Ruben Bloomberg said he was unaware of any injuries.   The march was staged in support of 27 workers ordered to appearin court for allegedly singing freedom songs and dancing on publictrains.   The Congress of South African Trade Unions says more than 400 ofits members have been charged with disturbing he peace for singingon trains since June. Most of those who have appeared in courtreceived fines.   Today's court proceedings were postponed when the men ordered toappear did not show up.   The union said its members will continue singing on trains thatcarry workers to and from their jobs in the cities and the outlyingblack townships.   ``We will continue in a spirit of defiance,'' said unionofficial Ariel Mabalane. ``They sing to popularize their campaign,to express their feelings as the repressed and exploited.''   The labor group is one of the leading members of the MassDemocratic Movement, an anti-apartheid coalition that launched anationwide mass defiance campaign Aug. 2.   In another labor conflict, 13,500 autoworkers remained on strikein wage disputes at the Toyota, Volkswagen and South Africa MotorCorp. plants.   Toyota officials today described the strike as the worst ever inthe South African automaking industry.   The autoworkers, most of whom belong to the National Union ofMetalworkers of South Africa, have been off the job since last week.   The union is trying to negotiate a wage agreement on anationwide basis with all major auto companies. The strikes beganwhile negotiations were taking place and the companies have accusedthe union of bad faith.</TEXT></DOC>
