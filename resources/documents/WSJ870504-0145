Florida Power andamp; Light, the utility unit of FPL Group, said the request also would affect commercial customers. But commercial customers, &quot;because they are billed on a different rate, may pay a different amount on a cent-per-kilowatt-hour basis,&quot; a company spokesman said.    The rate increase, which would take effect June 1, would cover four months, and bring a projected $164 million in additional revenue, the company said. Florida Power said the increase was prompted by higher fuel costs stemming from the success of OPEC's recent agreement to limit supplies. Oil prices are averaging $17 a barrel, $5.25 a barrel over projections made in February, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
