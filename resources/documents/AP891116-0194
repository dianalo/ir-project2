(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A decision to tape virtually alltelephone calls at state police barracks, including calls made bysuspects to their attorneys, was made by top state police officialsalmost three years ago, a newspaper reported Thursday.   State police memorandums cited by The Hartford Courantcontradict statements made by the former commander of the statepolice when he resigned on Sunday.   Lester J. Forst, who also resigned his post as state publicsafety commissioner because of the controversy, said his topofficers weren't aware of the scope of the taping.   There is no indication in the memorandums, however, that Forsthimself was aware of the taping system, The Courant reported.   The newspaper also cited inventory documents from February 1987and 1988 suggesting that state police played back tapes to checkthe quality of the recordings. The documents do not make clear ifpolice played back tapes of client-attorney calls.   The taping of all calls going in and out of state policebarracks is the subject of FBI and federal grand juryinvestigations. Gov. William A. O'Neill has ordered a review ofstate and municipal police taping policies and a halt to recordingof attorney-client calls.   State police have insisted they did not listen to privilegedcalls between suspects and their attorneys and have claimed thatthe taping system was installed so police could verify details ofcalls for help, for example.   The new state police commander, Bernard R. Sullivan, declined tocomment on the newspaper report and said he would wait until allinvestigations are completed.   State Supreme Court Chief Justice Ellen A. Peters rejected arequest by a state senator for an investigation into whether judgesor lawyers knew of the taping system. Peters said if the senatorhad any evidence of that, he should make it public.   Meanwhile, the state agreed Thursday to a plea-bargain in aWaterbury trial where the existence of the taping system was firstrevealed.   A Waterbury police detective charged with drunken driving andmanslaughter for hitting a women agreed to plead guilty tonegligent homicide with a motor vehicle and receive a four-monthsuspended sentence and one year's probation. The detective'slawywer had subpoenaed state police officials to testify about thetaping system, but the plea-bargain eliminated that possibility.   In Wallingford, town attorney Adam Mantzaris said his town'spolice may have illegally taped phone conversations in thedepartment's cellblock. Mayor William W. Dickinson Jr. ordered thetaping halted Tuesday.   And state police who investigated the case of a teen-age girlcharged in the killing of her mother will be asked to testify inHartford Superior Court Friday whether they videotaped or recordedany conversations of the defendant or other witnesses.   According to the Courant, a Dec. 3, 1986, memorandum sent byDominick Console, the civilian telecommunications chief for thedepartment, to Lt. Henry Bourgeois, commanding officer of the statepolice communications center, said it was ``time to remind the topmanagement'' about the taping system and to decide what linesshould be recorded.   A meeting apparently was held a week later on the matter.   A memorandum dated Dec. 12, 1986, from Capt. Ronald P. Mikulka,commanding officer of technological support services, to Bourgeoisand Console, said:   ``In accordance with a decision reached at the Dec. 10, 1986,Staff Meeting all telephone lines are to be recorded. The onlyexception will be the Troop Lieutenant's private line.''   The memorandum instructs them to ``make arrangements to obtainand distribute appropriate labels to be affixed to Troop phoneswhich will notify users that all lines are taped.''   The stickers never reached most telephones in police barracksand a policy requiring troopers to tell anyone using the telephonesthat their conversations would be recorded was never developed, TheCourant said.</TEXT></DOC>
