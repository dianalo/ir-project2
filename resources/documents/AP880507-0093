LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Liberal and conservative wings of the UnitedMethodist church, often in conflict over issues such ashomosexuality, seemed to find a middle ground and reached asurprising reconciliation at their just-concluded governingconference.   ``We've seen here a real coming together,'' said the Rev. DennisM. Campbell of Duke University Divinity School in North Carolina.``There has been a great spirit of inclusiveness and openness.''   Bishop Earl G. Hunt of Lakeland, Fla., outgoing president of theCouncil of Bishops, said, ``We moved back to our moorings.''   The 9.6-million-member United Methodist church, the secondlargest in American Protestantism next to the Southern BaptistConvention, wound up its 11-day conference Friday night.   The conference's centerpiece achievement was a new doctrinalsummary, adopted overwhelmingly by the nearly 1,000 delegates afterkeen differences between liberals and conservatives were amicablyresolved in committee.   That 10,000-word document covers basic beliefs, emphasizing theprimacy of Scripture but also affirming the value of theologicalexploration.   As the church's compass for the years ahead, it drew accoladesfrom all sides, conservative, liberal and in-between.   Terming it ``a miracle,'' the Rev. Donald Messer, a Denvertheologian who had objected to an earlier draft as suppressive,applauded the modified and approved version as a win for everyone.   It also was hailed by conservatives. The Rev. James Heidinger ofWilmore, Ky., head of an evangelical caucus called Good News, saidit provided ``a good distinction between doctrinal norms andtheological process.''   Both wings also indicated that same sort of satisfaction withother major decisions by the conference, including its adoption ofa new hymnal and stands on homosexuality.   While the church traditionally has been socially activist,conservatives had charged that it had swung too far in thatdirection.   ``Righteousness prevailed,'' said the Rev. Edmond Robb, anevangelist from Marshall, Texas. ``Liberals listened to the grassroots. There has been a mellowing on both sides.''   From the other camp, the Rev. James A. Wall of Chicago,influential Methodist editor of the ecumenical weekly ChristianCentury, said: ``What impressed me was the more conciliatory mood.As a liberal, I was not bothered to see a clear shift toaccommodate conservatives in the church.''   He said national church leadership previously had gotten ``outof step with the constituency'' and called the new position ``morecentrist.''   The high level of consensus was indicated by overwhelmingconcurrence in the key votes, usually more than 80 or 90 percent ofthe delegates. Only on subsidiary matters did any wide divisionsshow up, and these were rare.   The lengthiest debate, nearly four hours, came on the issue ofhomosexuality. The debate ended with the church reaffirming its banon active homosexuals in the ministry and condemning such activitygenerally.   But the vote on that also showed strong support _ 80 percent _in affirming this stand: ``Although we do not condone the practiceof homosexuality and consider this practice incompatible withChristian teaching, we affirm that God's grace is available toall.''   That phrase was added to point up inclusion of everyone,whatever their sins, within the church's caring. So were severalconfessions of the church's insufficient understandings of sexualcomplexities.   The church ordered a comprehensive scientific-theologicalinquiry into homosexuality as well biblical-ethical analysis.   ``Homosexuality has proved to be particularly troubling toconscientious Christians of differing opinions,'' the church said,with ``important questions'' remaining in dispute.   ``It's a tacit recognition that there is some legitimacy tovarious points of view,'' said the Rev. George McClain of NewYork's Staten Island, executive of the Methodist Federation forSocial Action.   A big conference step was adoption of an updated 960-page bookof ritual, psalms and hymns, sticking to masculine imagery in thelyrics about God, but using sexually inclusive language aboutpeople.   There also are three new hymns allegorically portraying thefeminine aspects of God, and added Hispanic, black, Korean andother ethnic songs and spirituals.   Delegates stiffened their stand on abortion, condemning it asmeans of birth control or for selecting a baby's sex.   Summing up the conference, the Rev. Spurgeon Dunnam of Dallassaid:   ``Traditional categories of right and left just don't fit thisconference. The pronounced effort has been to come together tobuild consensus. I've sensed a lot of moving toward each other.''</TEXT></DOC>
