It undergirds ourcollective consciousness.   ``But there is an enormous gap between the rhetoric of theAmerican Dream and the blemished reality.''   Simons himself attended public school, albeit the rarefied hallsof the Bronx High School of Science. ``When I grew up, I neverrealized there was another set of schools,'' he says.   As a teacher of gifted students in the South Bronx, Simonsdespaired of watching talented children languish in unchallenging,sometimes chaotic public schools.   ``Most of those kids get destroyed long before they get to thestarting gate,'' he says.   Outside the classroom, ``The environment would mow them down.Peer pressure. There is a density of kids who don't have a sense ofoptions, and that reinforces the limitations.''   ``The public school system doesn't meet the needs of the youngpeople of the community,'' Ms. Wang says.   ``Most of the children come from gifted programs or magnetschools, but they're still in very large classes. They don't havethe skills to compete at the collegiate level.''   Prep for Prep grew out of Simons' field work toward a doctoratein gifted education. He never got that degree _ work on the programswamped him, he says _ but he succeeded in proving that ``one personcan have an effect on people's lives.''   Simons wants the Prep for Prep students to end up in positionswhere they can ``legitimately and effectively affect decisions.''   ``From their own lives, they may have a sense of how publicpolicy most impacts those least able to influence it,'' he says.``We want to inculcate a sense of social responsibility.''   ``They tell us, `It's not about social welfare, it's about socialchange. You're capable people _ we need people in power whorepresent everybody,''' said Charles Guerrero, a 16-year-old fromthe Bronx who graduated from Fieldston this spring and will attendHarvard in September.   Says Frankie Cruz, who was one of Simons' students in the Bronx:``For a selected few students, he made the American Dream possible.You can say it's idealistic, but through hard work and the kind ofcommitment he demands, he made it successful.''   That commitment means 11- and 12-year-olds who find their summersshot, all for an intangible goal years in the future.   ``I didn't feel I was losing out on anything. I felt I wasgaining everything,'' says Angel Colon, a 12-year-old from Brooklynwho will switch from P.S. 250 to Packer Collegiate in the fall.   ``But the adjustment period was tough,'' he says. ``For example,my best friend would always call me about his new comic books, hisnew bike. He'd say he went to the pool Friday, he went to GreatAdventure Wednesday.''   His mother, Damaris Dumey, recalled his saying, ``When I'm small,why make me give up my summer?''   ``I feel the program has secured his future, academically,'' shesays. ``If it wasn't for this program, he wouldn't be on his feettoday, because of the peer pressure.''   Luanda Williams found ``the amount of work you get every night isoverwhelming. Sometimes I'm up to 11 o'clock. I think, if I make itthrough this, I'll go to one of the best schools and everything willwork out.''   Sometimes the social adjustment is just as big.   ``One of the first things that happens is their speech patternschange, they sound different,'' says Martha Boyd, a counselor whoholds sessions for the children that cover everything from etiquetteto drugs to getting along with rich white kids.   ``This bothers some children _ `You're not sounding like you'resupposed to,''' she says. ``Their dress changes, their valueschange, their behavior changes. We tell them change is all right,it's natural. Don't be afraid of it.''   Cherell Carr found she enjoys Dalton and the Upper East Side: ``Ilike the fact that they learn from you as much as you learn fromthem. They only know about themselves; they're learning about othercultures now.''   ``I have a lot of friends back home who are very bright, whocould make it in college but are not on the right track,'' saysNicole Atchison, who came out of the Bronx, into Prep for Prep andon to Cornell, from which she graduated this spring.   ``They don't think they can make it, they weren't encouraged,they don't think have enough money,'' she says. ``What Prep for Prepdoes is start you out on the right track.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 9</NOTE></DOC>
