Myson last month accepted a lower offer from Yale andamp; Valor PLC, a security and home-products group, but Myson said it has withdrawn its recommendation of that offer and intends to urge its shareholders to accept Blue Circle's bid.    &quot;There is considerable commercial logic in putting Myson together with Blue Circle,&quot; said Myson's chairman, Ray Wheeler. Blue Circle owns Armitage Shanks, Potterton and New World, all suppliers of bathroom, heating and kitchen products.    Part of Blue Circle's business strategy is to concentrate on and expand its core building-material and home-products operations in the U.S. and Europe, the company said. Blue Circle hopes to purchase Myson to &quot;broaden and strengthen&quot; its product lines. </TEXT></DOC>
