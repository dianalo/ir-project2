Stertz (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WNEWS </CO><IN> AUT </IN><DATELINE> TROY, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Audi of America Inc. reassigned its top sales manager in a bid to reverse its deep sales swoon in the U.S. market over the past two years.    The Volkswagen of America Inc. subsidiary reassigned James Wolter, its vice president and general sales manager for the past 2 1/2 years, to a position that currently reports to him -- manager of the Los Angeles-based Pacific sales region. His new title takes effect April 1. Volkswagen of America is a unit of West German auto maker Volkswagen AG.    Sources at Audi said Mr. Wolter's transfer, announced internally yesterday and scheduled for public announcement later, is an attempt to show dealers and consumers that there is some effort to halt Audi's sliding U.S. sales.    The slump began more than two years ago when complaints of sudden acceleration -- in which cars with automatic transmissions unexpectedly accelerate for no apparent reason -- mounted against the Audi 5000, Audi's best selling model. During Mr. Wolter's tenure as general sales manager, Audi sales fell to 41,322 last year from 74,241 in 1985. Analysts predict Audi sales will fall to about 22,500 cars this year barring a significant uptick.    Audi has tried to reverse its fortunes with the 5000. Efforts include offering costly rebates, and the company plans to rename the model later this year.    Joseph Tate, Audi's southern region manager, was named to succeed Mr. Wolter. Michael Lynch, currently Audi's Pacific region manager, succeeds Mr. Tate in Atlanta.    In an interview, Mr. Wolter declined to say whether his new job is a demotion. He said he is going to Los Angeles to improve weak Audi sales in California.    The shake-up of the sales staff is the latest in a series of top management changes at Audi over the past six months. In January, Volkswagen of America named Richard L. Mugg to the head of its Audi unit. Previously he had been in charge of the company's central marketing staff. Mr. Mugg succeeded Richard C. Marcy, who resigned after only four months in the Audi post. </TEXT></DOC>
