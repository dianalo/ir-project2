What is reported here includes the simulation performed to evaluatethe operational characteristics of the plant, an outline and featuresof the curvature-type solar collector, the composition and characteristicsof the developed selective absorption surface and selective transmissivefilm, the type, heat storage material, and performance of the developedheat storage, and the results of the operation tests on the pilot plant.The results of the operation tests include the confirmation of the performanceof the light collecting, heat collecting, and heat storage systems. Thepaper also discusses the development of a future solar power plant. Thereports on this future plant include the features of the light solarcollector developed since 1981, the proposal of an apparent-heat dissolutionheat storage, an outline of the test-elaborated small general testingequipment, rough design of a 10 MWe plant and investigation on its operation,and an outline of cost evaluation on a future solar thermal power plant.(7 figs, 10 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
