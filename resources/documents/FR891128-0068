Manufacturers is proposing that Companywill engage in these activities on a nationwide basis.Manufacturers is currently authorized to engage indirectly in providingsecurities brokerage and related services generally, and investment advisoryand securities brokerage services on a combined basis to institutionalcustomers, as well as underwrite and deal in obligations of the UnitedStates, general obligations of states and their political subdivisions,and other obligations that state member banks are authorized to underwriteand deal in under 12 U.S.C 24 and 335. Manufacturers is also authorizedto engage through Company in underwriting and dealing to a limited extentin municipal revenue bonds, 1-4 family mortage-backed securities, consumer-receivablerelated securities, and commercial paper. Additionally, Company is authorizedto act as a placement agent with respect to commercial paper.Manufacturers has applied to engage, through Company, in the placement,as agent for issuers, of all types of securities within the following limitations:(1) Company will privately place securities exclusively with ``accreditedinvestors'', as defined in Rule 501(a) issued by the SEC under the 1933Act, will make no general solicitation or general advertising for suchsecurities, and such securities will not be purchased by the general public;(2) Company will not purchase or repurchase for its own account (otherthan as riskless principal) the securities being privately placed and willnot inventory unsold portions of such securities; (3) except as otherwisepermitted in prior Board orders, Company will execute securities transactionsas principal only as a ``riskless principal'', <T3>i.e. </T3>only where there are firm offsetting orders to buy and sell,and will not act as riskless principal in any transaction where a foreignaffiliate is a counterparty; (4) Manufacturers will adopt appropriate procedures,including maintenance of necessary documentary records, to ensure thatany extensions of credit by it or any of its subsidiaries to issuers ofsecurities privately placed by Company (including securities privatelyplaced by Company in a riskless principal transaction) or to purchasersof such securities are on an arm's-length basis; (5) no bank affiliateof Company will express an opinion with respect to the advisability ofthe purchase of securities privately placed by Company (including securitiesprivately placed by Company in a riskless principal transaction) unlessthe bank notifies the customer that Company is privately placing the security;(6) neither Manufacturers nor any of its other subsidiaries will purchase,as principal, securities that are privately placed by Company (includingsecurities privately placed by Company in a riskless principal transaction)during the period of the placement; (7) neither Manufacturers nor any ofits bank subsidiaries will purchase, as a trustee or in any other fiduciarycapacity, for accounts over which they have investment discretion, securitiesprivately placed by Company (including securities privately placed by Companyin a riskless principal transaction) during the period of the placement,unless such purchase is authorized under the instrument creating the fiduciaryrelationship, by court order, or by the law of the jurisdiction under whichthe trust is administered.The Board has not previously determined that the proposed combination ofactivities is permissible under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding CompanyAct. Section 4(c)(8) provides that a bank holding company may, with Boardapproval, engage in any activity ``which the Board after due notice andopportunity for hearing has determined (by order or regulation) to be soclosely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.'' Manufacturersmaintains that the proposed placement and riskless principal activitiesare closely related to banking because banks generally provide privateplacement services.In determining whether an activity is a proper incident to banking, theBoard must consider whether the proposal may ``reasonably be expected toproduce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increasedcompetition, or gain in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects,such as undue concentration or resources, decreased or unfair competition,conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices.'' Manufacturers contendsthat permitting Company to engage in the proposed activities would enhancecompetition and help make Company a stronger participant in the privateplacement market. Manufacturers maintains that approval of its proposalwould result in increased efficiencies for Manufacturers as well as increasedconvenience for customers, including reduced issuer costs and enhancedliquidity in the secondary market for privately placed securities.Furthermore, states Manufacturers, any potential adverse effects or conflictsof interest that might be said to arise from the proposed activities areadequately addressed by the structural operational insulation between Companyand its bank affiliates, as well as the limits on affiliate transactionsimposed by sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, and the antityingprovisions of the Bank Holding Company Act. Manufacturers argues that therisks associated with the proposed activities are no greater than the risksincurred by banks in engaging in private placement and riskless principalactivities.Manufacturers further contends that approval of the application would notbe barred by section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act (12 U.S.C. 377), relyingon <T3>Securities Industry Ass'n </T3>v. <T3>Board of Governors, </T3>807 F.2d 1052 (D.C.
