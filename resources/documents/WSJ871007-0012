Terms weren't disclosed.    Labatt plans to form a new unit that would combine the Latrobe, Pa.-based brewery -- Labatt's first U.S. brewing plant -- and Labatt Importers Inc. The new unit will be based in Darien.    Latrobe is best known for its Rolling Rock premium beer brand, sold mainly in the Philadelphia area, Labatt said.    Labatt, London, Ontario, said the acquisition is &quot;a building brick&quot; and fits company strategy to market specialty beer products in the U.S. Labatt said it plans no changes to the 200-employee work force at Latrobe Brewing.    Labatt is Canada's biggest brewery and also has interests in packaged foods and agricultural products. </TEXT></DOC>
