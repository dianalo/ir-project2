Yasser Abd-Rabbo, a member of the PLO's 15-man ExecutiveCommittee, said he's against talks that don't include the PLO.   ``This plan is not acceptable to us at all because it is the PLOthat appoints its own representatives to any negotiations,'' hetold Egypt's state Middle East News Agency.   U.S. and Israeli proposals ``have only one aim and that is towaste time,'' Abd-Rabbo said after arriving in Cairo for meetingswith Egyptian officials.   Israel Radio said the plan proposed by Secretary of State JamesA. Baker III would have Egypt consult with the Palestinians on thecomposition of their delegation and would have Israel agree to thedialogue only if it is satisfied with the choice of the Palestiniannegotiators.   The Israeli plan Abd-Rabbo referred to was in May by IsraeliPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for Palestinian elections in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza sector who would negotiate withIsrael on interim autonomy. Talks on the final status of theterritories would be held later.   Abd-Rabbo is the chief PLO delegate to PLO talks with the UnitedStates in Tunis, capital of Tunisia. The talks began in Decemberafter PLO chairman Yasser Arafat publicly renounced terrorism andrecognized Israel's existence. Four rounds have been held so far.   Baker's five-point plan has not been officially disclosed. Butofficials in Washington and Jerusalem said it sought to reconcileIsraeli and Egyptian views on a proposed Israeli-Palestiniandialogue. Baker suggested he and the foreign ministers of Egypt andIsrael meet in Washington in two weeks for talks.   Baker advanced his plan after Israel's decision-making innerCabinet rejected last Friday an Egyptian proposal for anIsraeli-Palestinian dialogue in Cairo. Israel objected mainly toCairo's suggestion that the Palestinian delegation include membersfrom outside the occupied territories, possibly activists deportedby Israel. Jerusalem saw it as a ploy to bring the PLO to thenegotiating table.   The PLO's Central Council is to meet Sunday in Baghdad, Iraq, toreview all peace ideas of past months and is expected to issue apolicy statement. The council is an intermediary between theExecutive Committee and the Palestine National Council, the PLO'sparliament-in-exile.</TEXT></DOC>
