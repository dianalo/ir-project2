WallStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MTCEARNINGS (ERN)CHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM) </IN><TEXT>   Monsanto Co. posted fourth-quarter net income of $23 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $340 million.    The results largely reflect a huge restructuring charge Monsanto took in the 1985 fourth quarter, and a smaller restructuring credit in the 1986 period. Without those items, St. Louis-based Monsanto would have reported a pre-tax operating loss for the quarter of $6 million, compared with pre-tax operating earnings of $13 million in 1985.    Monsanto said fourth-quarter sales fell 11% to $1.57 billion from $1.76 billion, largely because of sluggish agricultural chemical sales and inventory reductions by buyers of Monsanto's NutraSweet artificial sweetener.    For the year, Monsanto earned $433 million, or $5.55 a share, compared with a loss of $98 million in 1985. Sales rose 2% to $6.88 billion from $6.75 billion.    Monsanto said continuing uncertainty about the amount of corn acreage that will be planted this spring hurt herbicide sales during the fourth quarter. Though sales of Lasso herbicide were &quot;significantly&quot; lower during 1986, the company said brisk international demand boosted sales of its other major herbicide, Roundup.    Meanwhile, fourth-quarter NutraSweet sales fell more than 25% from 1985 levels. Monsanto said the drop reflected weak sales of powdered soft drinks and sharp inventory reductions by White Plains, N.Y.-based General Foods Corp. and other NutraSweet customers. But A. Nicholas Fillepello, Monsanto's chief economist, said the company believes the worst of the inventory correction is over, adding &quot;the fundamental demand for NutraSweet products continues to grow.&quot;    Monsanto said earnings for its non-agricultural chemical business were sharply higher in both the quarter and year, partly because of lower raw-material costs. A pickup in consumer demand for automobiles and home furnishings also helped the segment, the company said.    Monsanto's electronic materials business narrowed its losses in 1986; orders for semiconductor materials remained low. Costs associated with the start-up of a new silicon wafer plant in Japan also hurt fourth-quarter results, Mr. Fillepello said.    Separately, Monsanto said its board authorized the buyback of as many as three million common shares in open market and private transactions during 1987. The stock will be used, among other things, for employee stock plans and general corporate purposes. As of Dec. 31, Monsanto had 77.7 million shares outstanding.    Monsanto stock closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape at $83.75 a share, down $2.75. </TEXT></DOC>
