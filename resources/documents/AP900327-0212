In the Netherlands, museums are busy preparing exhibitions ofpaintings and drawings by van Gogh to mark the centennial of theDutch artist whose works have become the most expensive in arthistory.   Van Gogh was poor all his life and could not sell his work. Butin eight months in 1987, three paintings by him of irises,sunflowers and a bridge sold for $114 million.   At one time, van Gogh's paintings were used for target practice.Wilkie said he discovered that at St. Remy mental hospital, whereVan Gogh was a voluntary patient in 1889, the son of the doctor incharge and a friend used the artist's canvasses that he had leftbehind as targets for their bows and arrows.   ``Only much later, when van Gogh became so famous, did theyrealize what they had destroyed,'' Wilkie said. He said he was toldof the archery targets by the grandson of van Gogh's guard at thehospital.   Wilkie tracked down the man and others connected with van Goghthrough telephone calls in the Netherlands, Belgium, England andFrance where the artist lived during his 37 years.   ``I called people of the same name in the telephone book,'' saidWilkie, 47, a Scottish journalist from Dundee who lives inAmsterdam.   The book revises and updates his first book on the artist in1978, ``The Van Gogh Assignment,'' which evolved from an article hewas asked to write in 1972.   His first break in 1972 was a chance meeting with Vincent Willemvan Gogh, then 83, son of the artist's brother, Theo.   ``Willem was a year old when he was held in the arms of Vincent,who shot himself two months later,'' Wilkie said. ``All the oldpeople I spoke to in the first few years are now dead.''   He listed his most important discoveries as a drawing by vanGogh of the house in London where he lodged in 1873; a photographof Eugenie Loyer, the landlady's daughter who rejected van Gogh'soffer of marriage; and the information out that Vincent and Theowere both treated for syphilis.   ``Eugenie's rejection had a profound effect on the course of vanGogh's immediate life, and the disease explains many curiousactions of the brothers,'' said Wilkie.   ``Vincent was fired from his job in a London art dealer's afterhe began telling the customers what he really thought of therubbish on the walls. He then became obsessed with religion andfeelings of compassion for the poor,'' Wilkie said. ``I think thesyphilis was responsible for his schizophrenia and fits, and forTheo dying paralyzed and insane six months after Vincent.''   Wilkie said that by going to places where van Gogh had been, heuncovered things that aren't in art history books.   ``There are scores of art history books about Van Gogh but theytend to rely on what other art historians have written,'' he said.   In south London, at 87 Hackford Road, a blue plaque on athree-story row house records that Van Gogh lived there in 1873-74.   Arthur Smith, a retired sanitary inspector who is the currentoccupant, said nothing remains of the artist except an old outdoortoilet that he probably used.   ``We get film crews and lots of Japanese tourists and we getnothing for it,'' he said. ``We can't even park the car.''   ``Do you think I could auction the blue plaque?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, April 6-8</NOTE></DOC>
