The company, as expected, also named its president andoperating chief, Alfred M. Zeien, as chairman and chiefexecutive officer.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Zeien, a 22-year veteran of Gillette who was namedpresident and operating chief last November, succeeds ColmanM. Mockler Jr., who died last month of a heart attack.   Separately, Gillette said it intends to redeem the $600million in 8.75% Series B preferred stock held by insurancesubsidiaries of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. andconvert them into 12 million Gillette common shares, or 11%of Gillette's common shares outstanding after the conversion.   The conversion will mean a handsome profit on theinvestment for Mr. Buffett, who is considered a savvyinvestor. The preferred is convertible at $50 a share and atyesterday's closing price for the company's common of $73.25,up $2.50, Mr. Buffett has made a paper profit of $279million. Mr. Buffett bought the preferred stock as a friendlyinvestor and joined Gillette's board in July 1989, not longafter Gillette narrowly won a proxy fight against a hostileinvestor group.   Prudential Securities analyst Andrew Shore said it wasgenerally expected that Gillette would convert Mr. Buffett'sholdings: &quot;Sure, there was some skittishness over whether hewas going to be a seller to offset some losses on otherinvestments. I think he believes this is a strong,irreplaceable global franchise that seems to be nicking awayat its competitors pretty substantially,&quot; he said. Mr.Buffett couldn't be reached to comment.   For its fourth quarter, Gillette reported a profit of$106.6 million, up sharply from the year-earlier quarter'searnings of $79.4 million. Sales rose 18% to $1.24 billionfrom $1.05 billion.   After payment of preferred stock dividends of $14.4million in the latest quarter, per-share earnings rose 40% to95 cents from 68 cents last year, when preferred dividendpayments were $13.1 million.   Mr. Shore said &quot;clearly it was a powerful quarter&quot; butsaid the earnings were in line with expectations and theother announcements really didn't come as any surprise. &quot;Itsrazor and blades division led the quarter on sales, butreally the business was led on the profit line in the quarterby toiletries and Jafra&quot; cosmetics.   As for the stock split and dividend boost, Mr. Shore said&quot;the $70 {per-share price} level is usually a good strikelevel for them to do this.&quot;   The company said it intends to increase its dividend to15.5 cents on the split shares. The new rate is equivalent to31 cents on pre-split shares, an effective increase from the27 cents it currently pays.   If holders approve the increase in authorized shares toeffect the stock split, the new shares will be issued tostockholders of record May 1. The new dividend rate would bepayable June 5 to holders of record May 1.   Gillette said sales at its North Atlantic operations were&quot;well above, and operating profits sharply higher&quot; than inthe year-earlier quarter, and sales at itsinternational/diversified operations were up sharply, whileoperating profits there showed a modest decline. It said netinterest expense was higher in the quarter while net currencyexchange losses and the tax rate declined.   Gillette said that for the first time, yearly sales at itsBraun small appliance division surpassed $1 billion and itsNorth Atlantic toiletries division moved from a loss in theprior year's quarter to a profit in the latest quarter. Thecompany realigned the toiletries division and sold someEuropean brands last year. The company's Oral B dentalproducts and stationery products did well.   Mr. Zeien, 60 years old, had been regarded as a likelysuccessor to Mr. Mockler, whose retirement had been scheduledfor the end of this year. A Gillette spokesman said Mr. Zeienwon't retain the titles of president and operating chief andthe company's board didn't take any action regarding thoseposts. He declined to comment further.   For the year, net income rose 29% to $367.9 million from$284.7 million in 1989. Sales rose 14% to $4.34 billion from$3.82 billion in the prior year.   After payment of preferred dividends of $57.3 million,per-share earnings rose 19% to $3.20 from $2.70 in 1989 whenpreferred dividend payments totaled $23.5 million.</TEXT></DOC>
