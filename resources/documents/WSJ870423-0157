Today, the government is trying to play down the disaster as a minor disturbance. It's not succeeding very well.    Chernobyl made life in Poland even harsher than it already was for its citizens. It contaminated the air and soil. It cut into desperately needed export earnings.    But the accident in the Soviet Union may have had a positive influence on one thing in Poland -- the quality of public debate. It led to open criticism of nuclear power by a few groups of outspoken citizens. The government has largely ignored them, though in one exceptional instance it appears to be taking account of popular opinion on where to build a nuclear plant.    In an interview with the official press last month, the man who oversees Polish nuclear-power development, Jerzy Bijak, acknowledged that the state was less inclined to build a reactor on a proposed site near Karolewo, on the Vistula River, because &quot;part of the local community refuses to accept this power plant.&quot;    &quot;The plan has exposed a conflict between two different ways of thinking,&quot; he said, &quot;both of which I understand to reflect the public interest, though from different angles.&quot;    Radioactive winds from Chernobyl, only 370 miles from Warsaw, blew north towards Scandinavia right after the accident, then hooked south to cross Poland before curling back toward the Soviet Union. The government gave iodine to children in the cloud's path. It has since reported no deaths or illnesses.    Last summer, Polish food exports to the West fell, as did exports from countries the length of Eastern Europe. Poles still enjoy a dubious benefit in the form of good Bulgarian wine the West rejected. But they lost at least $50 million in hard currency.    The worst effects, the state says, are over. Monitoring with new American equipment shows that radioactivity in meat, soil, milk, fish and water has dropped to acceptable levels. &quot;They are all coming slowly to full normalization,&quot; says Tadeusz Rzymkowski, director of Poland's Central Laboratory for Radiological Protection.    A Polish nuclear physicist, speaking unofficially and not for attribution, isn't quite so sanguine. He says Polish soil remains peppered with &quot;hot particles&quot; of highly radioactive material, some large enough to see with the naked eye. &quot;If you plow ground that contains a number of particles,&quot; he says, &quot;you can inhale them.&quot;    But Mr. Rzymkowski dismisses such concerns. &quot;These particles are interesting from the scientific point of view, but they don't constitute a threat,&quot; he says. &quot;We were lucky. The wind changed.&quot;    The government dismisses just as quickly public complaints about its nuclear-power program. Yet the complaints keep coming.    Poland's first nuclear plant is being built near Gdansk. It should go to work by 1991, leaving Romania as the only East Bloc country without one. A second may be built near Poznan, now that the government has shied from the site at Karolewo.    But the people of Poznan object, too. The biology department at Poznan University and 150 farmers in the area have signed a petition asking the authorities for a referendum on the project. The state-approved Polish Ecology Club, with 2,500 members, wants a national referendum on the whole nuclear-energy question.    And in the shadow of Chernobyl, the Soviet-engineered plant near Gdansk is besieged by anti-nuclear rhetoric. An outlawed activist group called Freedom and Peace drew 2,000 supporters to a protest march last June, and gathered as many names on a petition against the plant a few weeks ago.    Activists argue against building the plant without a containment structure. Rumors have spread that construction stopped for five months last year because cracks had formed in the concrete.    &quot;I'm sure nuclear power is good and safe, but it's impossible in the Soviet bloc,&quot; says Andrzej Wierusz, a nuclear-reactor designer who lost his job and was briefly jailed after the martial-law crackdown of 1981. &quot;In this system, you can have no real quality control. It's a danger for all mankind.&quot;    Jerzy Bijak, the state's nuclear-power overseer, attributed the building halt to a shortage of high-quality cement. He called rumors of cracks &quot;rubbish,&quot; adding that &quot;Soviet specialists are also making sure that construction standards are being observed.&quot;    The government, he said, will build the plant near Gdansk. It will make no changes in the design. With Poland's coal vital for export earnings, its mines getting deeper and more dangerous, and miners more difficult to recruit, the rest of the country's nuclear program will also proceed as planned.    Mr. Bijak says: &quot;I see no other realistic solution.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
