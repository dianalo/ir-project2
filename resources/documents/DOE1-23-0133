<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-23-0133 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new type of time-of-flight recoil spectrometer designed to measure themasses of neutron-rich light nuclei has recently been completed at LAMPF.The spectrometer relies on an isochronous design that directly correlatesan ion's time-of-flight through the spectrometer with its mass-to-chargeratio. Additional measurements of the ion's velocity and energy enablethe charge state of the recoil to be uniquely defined and thus permitprecision mass measurements given sufficient statistics. The performanceof the spectrometer has been investigated in both-off line (using alphasources) and on-line tests. The design resolution of {Delta}M/M=1/2000(fwhm) has been achieved. Initial performance results of the spectrometerare described with emphasis placed on the techniques used to achievethe overall high mass resolution and large solid angle/momentum acceptance.</TEXT></DOC>
