Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., is urging theadministration to seek an open U.S. policy in Cambodia rather thantrying to secretly arm non-communist guerrillas there.   ``There is much at stake here and it seems inadvisable to engagein secret deals, secret policy, secret aid, and repeat the mistakesof the very recent past,'' Byrd told the Senate Friday.   ``If we are to re-engage in Southeast Asia let us do so,'' saidByrd, the former majority leader who chairs the AppropriationsCommittee. ``But let us do so only after thorough, open debate,with discussions of options and the careful formulation of a newU.S. policy in concert with other nations that wish to bringlong-term peace and stability to Cambodia.''   Vietnam announced last April 1 that it will end its 10-yearoccupation of Cambodia and withdraw all of its military forces bynext Sept. 30.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>Harris Corp.
