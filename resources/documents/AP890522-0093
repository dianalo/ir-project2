Phone numbers were selected randomly andinterviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recentbirthday, a random phenomenon.   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in thesample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that ifevery adult American were asked the same questions, the resultstheoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19times out of 20. The error margin is larger for subgroups.   There are other sources of potential error in polls, includingthe wording and order of questions.
