(RumorCentral) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Spencer andamp; Son.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Being older and wiser than his tagalong son, Spencer knows what lies aheadthis time of year.andM;This week it's Agenda '92, with 6 a.m.andP;  breakfast meetings, midnight boozeschmoozes and volleyball on the most beautiful beach in California.andP;  Then,after a week's respite, it's off to San Jose for Interop, to Dallas forNetWorld and to Graceland of the wasteland for the granddaddy of them all,Comdex/Fall.andM;The Wily One fondly recalls the days when he could party all night long andbe sharp and witty all day.andP;  Not anymore.andP;  Since Labor Day, Spencer hasadhered to his low-fat, veggies-and-fish diet, with a solid hour on thetreadmill and free weights each morning.andM;Of course, our hero will never turn into one of those quietly desperatehealth bores.andP;  As the Katt explained it, when the industry planets align toyield four can't-miss events in five weeks, one simply must stand anddeliver.andM;The physically fit feline felt a pang of sympathy for all the ISVs out therewith high blood pressure.andP;  It's not that they don't exercise enough, hemused.andP;  It's just that Microsoft is constantly fiddling with the APIs forWindows 3.1, setting off ISVs' tempers.andP;  How mad are they?andP;  So mad that whena customer called a PIM vendor on the East Coast to ask when their Windowsversion will ship, he got an earful of complaints about how &quot;Microsoft keepschanging the rules on us.&quot; The Windows 3.1 APIs are supposed to be done now,but Microsoft keeps rejiggling them, the Katt hears.andM;Perhaps ISVs' spirits will be lifted next week when IBM issues the final OS/22.0 SDK, Spencer thought hopefully.andM;One Windows app that will be on thousands of desktops across America verysoon is WordPerfect for Windows.andP;  The Katt can't decide which to anticipatemore: who will win the now-famous contest in which buyers predict how manyunits WordPerfect will ship in the first month, or how many bugs will becontained in those units.andM;Spencer hears that compatibility problems still exist with Adobe Type Managerand SuperPrint, that the spelling checker isn't reliable and UAEs still popup at the darndest times.andP;  WordPerfect, meanwhile, says all is well and readyto go, but the furtive feline wonders why the folks in Orem are making it soterribly difficult to enter CompuServe's WordPerfect for Windows beta forum.andO;Log on and check out the third degree you get (type &quot;wpbeta&quot; at any prompt).andO;What's to hide, folks?andM;Incidentally, WordPerfect may want to check some character references on thecompany it's currently romancing, Borland International.andP;  Granted, every ISVthese days is starving for Windows programmers, but there are limits.andM;It seems the president of Hilgraeve Inc., a communications software firm,recently got a call from someone claiming to be from Microsoft University,requesting the names of their Windows programmers so that invitations toWindows programming seminars could be sent to them free of charge.andP;  &quot;Such adeal,&quot; the prez said, and forthwith coughed up the names.andM;Within 48 hours a recruiter claiming to be from Borland called every singleprogrammer to woo them aboard Philippe's ship.andP;  Meanwhile, when Hilgraeve didsome checking, Microsoft U. said it made no such offer to Hilgraeve or anyoneelse.andM;All's fair, purred the Puss.andP;  Take Microsoft, for example, which callsprogrammers at Micrografx and asks, &quot;Where do you want to live?&quot; &quot;How much doyou want to make?&quot; and &quot;What kind of car do you want to drive?&quot; Prettysubtle, eh?andP;  Mergers and acquisitions aren't the only ways to consolidate anindustry.andM;Word from NCR is that only about 10 percent of the ATandamp;T Computer Systemsstaff will survive the merger of the two companies.andP;  The real fun will comewhen NCR reps walk in and try to &quot;upgrade&quot; ATandamp;T's EISA installed base, withall their already purchased peripherals, to NCR's Micro Channel machines.andM;Rumor Central closes this week with one more from the Microsoft joke mill.andM;Q: What do you get when you cross IBM with Apple Computer?andM;A: IBM.andM;Spencer and Son wish you a happy autumnal equinox and hope to see you in thelobby, by the pool, maybe even in the weight room.andP;  .....  .BRB</TEXT></DOC>
