A new data base has been developed with population resolutionon the scale of US Census enumeration districts. This data base incorporatescounty-level agricultural data that is distributed to the ed based onthe estimated fraction of rural-farm population in each ed. Three computercodes are used to read the new data base and write a file that can beread by the CRRIS codes. These codes and their use are documented here.10 refs., 4 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
