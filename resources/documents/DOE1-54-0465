A meltingat the intermediate Al layer was observed already at about 580 {sup 0}Cafter 2-s heat treatments. This rapid eutectic melting, assumed to initiateat the Al-Si interface, resulted in the formation of a unique contactcomposed of the Ni(Al/sub 0.5/Si/sub 0.5/)/Al{sub 3}Ni/Ni/sub x/Si/suby//n-Si structure with fairly smooth interfaces between the layers. Thesheet resistance of the layers and the Schottky barrier height of thecontact were measured as a function of the rapid thermal processing temperatures.As a result of the eutectic melting reaction at 580 {sup 0}C the sheetresistance of the formed layers decreased from 3.2 to 2.6 {Omega}/D'Alembertian,the Schottky barrier height between the layers and Si increased from0.61--0.76 eV, and the effective electrically active area of the contactincreased. These electrical properties are discussed in correlation withthe microstructure formed in the Ni/Al/Si system due to the rapid thermalprocessing.</TEXT></DOC>
