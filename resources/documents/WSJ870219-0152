Bouygues will make a profit of more than $11 million. The sale ends a five-month battle between Bouygues and Schneider for control of Spie and marks a setback in industrial strategy for Bouygues. But the transaction enhances Bouygues's cash flow at a time when it's making a costly bid for TF1, which the French government intends to sell this spring.    COPENHAGEN HANDELSBANK AS, Denmark's second-biggest bank, swung to a loss equivalent to $120 million in 1986 from a profit of $209 million in 1985. The result is among the worst in a string of weak annual results posted by Danish banks, reflecting both the depressed Danish stock market and the record results of 1985.    NIPPON KOKAN K.K., Japan's fifth-largest steelmaker, plans to cut as many as 7,000 jobs from its steel and shipbuilding divisions over three years as part of a reorganization plan to be presented to its unions Feb. 25, according to Japanese news reports. During the past two weeks, two other major Japanese steelmakers have unveiled similar plans.    NUOVO BANCO AMBROSIANO said 1986 profit jumped 82%, to the equivalent of $32.8 million from $18 million in 1985. A spokesman for the Milan, Italy, bank attributed the increase to improved results from securities-trading activities. In addition, a continuing program of automating branches helped reduce transaction costs and improve efficiency, he said. The bank was formed in 1982 from the collapsed Banco Ambrosiano. </TEXT></DOC>
