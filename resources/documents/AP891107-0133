RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In an emotionally charged case pittingprotection for children against the rights of parents, the SupremeCourt was urged Tuesday to uphold the indefinite jailing of aMaryland woman for refusing to disclose her son's whereabouts.   Social workers fear the child may be dead.   Mitchell Mirviss, a lawyer appointed to represent the missingchild, predicted ``extreme ramifications'' if the mother is allowedto go free to safeguard her Fifth Amendment right againstself-incrimination.   Upholding her rights would mean ``an infant who is defenselessand abused must be abandoned in an unprecedented extension of theFifth Amendment,'' he said.   Assistant Attorney General Ralph S. Tyler of Maryland agreed.   ``Where will we be if the state cannot enforce'' contempt ofcourt orders to assure children's safety? he asked. ``Will the mosteffective remedy be taken away?''   Allowing the Fifth Amendment to outweigh the child's welfarecould hamstring juvenile courts, Tyler said.   The court engaged in a spirited one-hour discussion in the caseof Jacqueline Bouknight, 23, in a Baltimore jail for more than 18months for refusing to disclose where her son is.   Bouknight's lawyer, George E. Burns, said authorities have otheralternatives to jailing the parent indefinitely for contempt ofcourt.   She could be prosecuted under a child neglect law that carries athree-year prison term, he said.   ``It's not true that the state can do nothing,'' Burns said.``It's not a matter of `we can't do it. We just won't do it.'''   Some justices raised the possibility that a ruling in the case,expected by July, could rest on narrower grounds.   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy noted thatsince Bouknight was jailed, Maryland has enacted a law that permitslaw enforcement officials to grant limited immunity fromprosecution to compel testimony.   In Bouknight's case, they suggested, the state could require herto reveal her son's whereabouts in return for assurances that thedisclosure will not be used to convict her of any criminal charges.   O'Connor described the process as ``a laser-like limitedimmunity'' that would permit prosecution of Bouknight withoutcompromising her protection against self-incrimination.   Social workers last saw Bouknight's son Maurice in September1987, when he was 11 months old.   Maurice was admitted to a Baltimore hospital on Jan. 23, 1987,when he was three months old for treatment of a broken leg andother injuries. For a while, he was held in protective care afterhis emotionally troubled mother was observed throwing Maurice intohis crib during the infant's hospitalization.   Maurice was returned to his mother's custody on July 17, 1987,after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergotraining in parenting skills.   Justice Harry A. Blackmun expressed dismay Tuesday at thatdevelopment.   ``Why do we need hindsight'' to realize the boy was in jeopardy,he said. ``Wasn't it apparent at the time?''   Nine months after Maurice was returned to his mother, socialworkers said Bouknight no longer was cooperating with them.Moreover, they said Maurice's father recently had been shot todeath in a drug-related killing and Bouknight was using drugs.   The mother was held in contempt of court by a judge on April 28,1988, after she refused to disclose Maurice's whereabouts.   The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled in December that jailing herfor refusing to disclose the information violates herconstitutional protection against self-incrimination.   But she has remained in jail under an order by Chief JusticeWilliam H. Rehnquist.   Some have compared the Bouknight case to that of Dr. ElizabethMorgan of Washington, D.C., released from prison on Sept. 25 aftermore than two years behind bars for refusing to let her daughtervisit the girl's father, Morgan's former husband.   Morgan went to jail rather than produce the girl, now 7, forcourt-ordered visits with the father. Morgan accused her formerhusband of sexually abusing the child, charges he consistently hasdenied.   In a pair of decisions Tuesday, the court:   _Refused, by a 7-2 vote, to ease the technical requirementsfacing people who sue to protect the environment.   The justices ruled that the victory it took an Oregon farmcouple three years and $95,000 to win against their county forpolluting their water supply had to be thrown out becausegovernment agencies were not notified before the lawsuit was filed.   _Voted 8-1 to make it easier for insurance companies to sue infederal court to challenge worker compensation awards. The decisionallows an Illinois insurer to go into federal court to attack aTexas man's worker compensation benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
