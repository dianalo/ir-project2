In addition to vehicles and communications equipment, the costincludes the distinctive blue berets and helmets of the U.N.peacekeepers and fragmentation jackets _ a reminder of the hazardsof their work.   The 70 military observers staff of the U.N. Angola VerificationMission, known as UNAVEM, are to oversee the withdrawal of theCubans as part of the southwest African peace accords signed inDecember at U.N. headquarters by Cuba, Angola and South Africa.   Under the accords South Africa will also grant independence tothe former Germany colony of Namibia, which the Pretoria governmenthas ruled since World War I.   The Security Council now is deadlocked over the cost of apeacekeeping force for Namibia's independence elections, a forceseparate from the Angola verification group.   The black African front-line states want 7,500 peacekeepers inNamibia, which could cost $700 million.   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has bowed tocost-cutting pressures from the United States, Soviet Union andother permanent Security Council members. He has recommended sending4,650 peacekeeping troops and about 500 police supervisors at a costof $416 million.   In Perez de Cuellar's report Tuesday to the General Assembly,which must approve the cost of the U.N. Angola force, he suggeststhe UNAVEM mission will cost $9.2 million in 1988 and $19.4 for theentire 31-month withdrawal.   The Security Council has already approved $4.2 million for theAngola force. Its mission began Jan. 3 and the U.N. observers havealready verified the early withdrawal of hundreds of Cuban soldiers.   The U.N. chief's report calls for a peak strength of 70 militaryobservers, up to 26 international support staff and 12 locallyrecruited staff based in the Angolan capital of Luanda.   Among the equipment needed by the force, as detailed in thereport, are 33 jeeps, nine automobiles, a mini-bus and a mobileworkshop.   Communications equipment includes a satellite station for$120,000, radio and teletype equipment, a coded fax machine for$28,000 and a coded text machine for $27,000.
