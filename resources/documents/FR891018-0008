In an Order released May 22, 1984, FCC 84-220, 49 FR 21737 (1984), theCommission amended andSection; 87.65 of the Rules, 47 CFR 87.65 to require,among other things, aircraft radio stations operating in the frequencyband 100 MHz to 470 MHz to maintain a frequency tolerance of 30 parts permillion (ppm).\1\<NOTE/> Section 87.133(a) of the rules, 47 CFR 87.133(a) providesthat 30 ppm is the maximum frequency tolerance permitted after January1, 1985, for new and replacement transmitters and for all transmittersafter January 1, 1990. The effect of this rule is to require modificationor replacement of all aircraft transmitters operating in the 100 MHz to470 MHz band that do not meet the 30 ppm frequency tolerance by January1, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 87.65 of the rules has since been recodified asandSection; 87.133, 47 CFR 87.133 See 53 FR 28940 (1988).2. When the Commission adopted the tolerance in 1984, it stated its intentionto conform part 87 of the Rules to the Final Acts of the World AdministrativeRadio Conference, Geneva, 1979 (WARC 79), which became effective internationallyon January 1, 1982. The Commission noted that the proposed frequency tolerancewas published in the <T3>Fifth Notice of Inquiry </T3>in General Docket 80-739 FFC 82-213, 47FR 25982 (1982) and that no comments were received regarding the proposedfrequency tolerance. The Commission also noted in its 1984 <T3>Order</T3> that adoption of the frequency tolerance was consistentwith the three-phase plan of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)to implement 25 kHz channel spacing in the 118-136 MHz band. No objectionsto or petitions for reconsideration of this action were received.3. In a letter dated July 31, 1989, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association,the Experimental Aircraft Association, the General Aviation ManufacturersAssociation, and the Helicopter Association International (hereafter petitioners)jointly petitioned the Commission to exclude all currently installed VHFaircraft radios from the 30 ppm frequency tolerance requirement. In supportof its petition, petitioners estimate that as many as 93,000 radios arecurrently installed in the general aviation fleet that do not meet thenew tolerance requirement. Petitioners point out that these radios areinstalled in small, singe-engine, piston-powered aircraft which are primarilyoperated in relatively remote areas of the United States where they wouldnot interfere with other U.S. or foreign radios employing the 30 ppm tolerance.The petitioners argue that the cost of replacing these radios which theyestimate to be approximately $1200 or the cost of modifying them, between$450 and $650 frequently will exceed the radio's market value. Further,the petitioners state that the international Radio Regulations do not requireall installed aircraft radios to meet to 30 ppm requirement by January1, 1990. They note that footnote 28 to appendix 7 of the internationalRadio Regulations permits installed aircraft radios with channel spacingof 50 kHz to continue to operate with a frequency tolerance of 50 ppm.4. We recognize the potential burden resulting from the pending changein the frequency tolerance requriement on the general aviation community.Additionally, we note that the continued operation of currently installedaircraft stations with a frequency tolerance of 50 ppm should not causeinterference to other stations. Therefore, to alleviate the pending impactand to allow sufficient time to analyze the effects of petitioners' requeston the general aviation community, we are extending the January 1, 1990,deadline to January 1, 1992, for meeting the 30 ppm frequency tolerancerequirement.5. Accordingly, pursuant to the authority in andSection;andSection; 0.331 and1.3 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 0.331 and 1.3, the requirement containedin footnote 2 of andSection; 87.133(a) of the Rules, 47 CFR 87.133(a), forcurrently installed aircraft stations operating in the band 100-470 MHzto maintain a frequency tolerance of 30 ppm effective January 1, 1990,IS WAIVED until January 1, 1992. The frequency tolerance for aircraft stationssubject to this waiver continues to be 50 ppm.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 80</ITAG>Aviation Service.<ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Communications Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ralph A.
