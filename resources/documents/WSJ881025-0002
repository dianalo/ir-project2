Though very preliminary, that could involve sharing an equity position with RJR management and Shearson and cutting a deal that may enable the company to retain F. Ross Johnson and other top executives following the leveraged buy-out. An RJR adviser said, &quot;Management is standing firm with our deal, but we are always prepared to talk.&quot;    According to the adviser, KKR officials placed calls to the RJR-Shearson camp, broaching a possible rapproachment. Shearson's refusal to make KKR an equity partner in a possible $75-a-share buy-out announced last week may have prompted the bid from the big leveraged buy-out concern.    Mr. Johnson, president and chief executive officer of the tobacco and food giant, was meeting late last night with Shearson advisers to consider a number of options, including a bid that would top KKR's. There's only one option that seems to have been ruled out: folding.    What form his next gambit will take is unclear, however. At one point yesterday a bid topping KKR's seemed imminent from the Johnson-led management group. But Shearson, surprised at the boldness of the KKR offer, was uncertain it could match it, according to a person familiar with the deliberations. What has been left is a situation in which RJR will in some form be irretrievably altered -- though in what form is uncertain.    &quot;Everybody is talking to everybody else,&quot; said one person close to the unfolding events -- and the outcome could even find such unlikely bedfellows as the RJR management group and KKR cutting a deal that would carve up the company between them.    At one level, that would be repugnant to Mr. Johnson and his management group, which includes Edward A. Horrigan Jr., head of RJR's tobacco business. They have resisted KKR's entreaties before and fear it would be intent on selling off all the company's food businesses and milking the tobacco business for cash.    But if the Johnson-led group were to win the company with a higher bid, it would have to do much the same. The $75-a-share offer contemplated keeping the tobacco line and the best parts of Nabisco Brands, if proceeds from certain asset sales and financing terms allowed it. That may be out of the question with a bid of more than $90 a share, particularly as the buyer must also assume about $5 billion of RJR debt. RJR executives believe such a bid could be financed but don't want to have to disassemble the whole company.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, RJR closed at $84 a share, up $7.25.    In addition, though Mr. Johnson heads the insider group, he doesn't necessarily have the inside track in the bidding contest. KKR will begin its $90-a-share offer for 87% of RJR's stock later this week, thus probably beating the Johnson-Shearson group to the punch with its bid. Holders of the remaining RJR shares would receive securities valued at $90 a share. To help pay for this, KKR has an enormous equity pool of $5.6 billion for leveraged buy-outs, which can readily be tapped.    By contrast, Shearson Lehman has been financially weakened by the sluggish state of the brokerage business. Under the original $75-a-share bid, the management-Shearson group was figuring on putting in about $2 billion of equity, getting more than $7 billion of commercial bank loans and issuing $5 billion of high-yield, high-risk &quot;junk&quot; bonds. Shearson also would have had to put up as much as $5 billion for a temporary &quot;bridge&quot; loan until the junk bonds were sold. The much bigger bid would be a much bigger stretch for Shearson.    A five-member special committee of RJR directors must weigh the offers when it gets them, and while originally perceived to be stacked in management's favor, it doesn't appear to be playing patsy to Mr. Johnson. Its most influential members are Charles E. Hugel, who was hand-picked by Mr. Johnson to be RJR's chairman, and Martin S. Davis, who is a friend of Mr. Johnson's. But both are also chief executives of major companies -- Combustion Engineering Inc. and Gulf andamp; Western Inc., respectively -- and are proving very independent-minded, according to people familiar with them.    In addition, Dillon Read andamp; Co., which is advising the special committee, was for many years the lead investment banker to RJR, until being displaced by Shearson Lehman. It well knows the values of the company's businesses, and it is guiding the committee in considering a wide range of options, including keeping the company together.    Because of the frenzy for food company acquisitions, though, RJR may be more valuable today broken up than together. Analysts estimate that Nabisco Brands could be valued at $8 billion to $9.5 billion on the open market, Del Monte Foods at $3 billion to $4 billion and Planters andamp; Life Savers at $1.5 billion to $2 billion.    Some analysts speculated yesterday that with Kraft Inc. rejecting a takeover bid and developing a defensive recapitalization plan, RJR may have a likely buyer for its whole foods business in Kraft's rejected suitor: Philip Morris Cos. In New York, a Philip Morris spokesman said, &quot;We are leaving the door open; we aren't walking away from the Kraft offer. However, as any prudent company would, we are considering all our options.&quot;    Some analysts believe KKR could approach RJR the way it did its largest-ever leveraged buy-out to date, the $6.2 billion purchase of Beatrice Cos. in 1986. In that case, KKR brought in Donald P. Kelly to engineer the transaction and run the company. The former Esmark Inc. chairman and chief executive officer knew Beatrice well because it had acquired his own company two years before. KKR could bring back one or more former RJR executives displaced by Mr. Johnson to run the company, analysts speculated yesterday.    But the RJR management group is betting that Mr. Johnson and Mr. Horrigan, head of the company's tobacco business, are important trump cards in this contest. If they refused to stay on under KKR, the buyer might have trouble running or selling pieces of the huge company. The hope is that KKR would be leery of trying to run a company whose top executives had resigned or that the special committee might be reluctant to recommend a sale to KKR under those circumstances.    By contrast, Mr. Johnson has close ties to Shearson Lehman. He is on the board of American Express Co., its 60% owner, and is personally close to James D. Robinson III, the chairman and chief executive of American Express.    ---                 Estimated Break-Up Value               Of RJR Nabisco's Businesses    Food:      Nabisco: $8 billion to $9.5 billion      Del Monte: $3 billion to $4 billion      Planters: $1.5 billion to $2 billion    Tobacco: $11.1 billion to $13.5 billion    Source: Analysts' estimates</TEXT></DOC>
