RothschildIn Clash Over Securities Firm's Future---By Steve Swartz and Udayan GuptaStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/16/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WNEWS RSECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two principals of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Holdings Inc. are leaving the securities firm, whose prominence has fallen along with its share of the high-technology stock market.    The firm said that 56-year-old Thomas I. Unterberg, chairman and chief executive officer, and A. Robert Towbin, 50, vice chairman, have agreed to leave, but that final terms haven't been worked out.    Industry sources say the planned departure comes after months of debate over the firm's mission. As the firm's share of initial public offerings in the high-technology field has dropped sharply, the firm has pushed hard to diversify, particularly in trading. The diversification, some say, tilted the balance of power away from Messrs. Unterberg and Towbin.    Robert Schoenthal, 44, who will become co-chief executive, said he and some other members of management were concerned about the future role of high technology within L.F. Rothschild. These managers, who now have control, are concerned about building &quot;a well-rounded, international investment banking firm,&quot; he said.    Francois Mayer, 45, who also will become co-chief executive, said the two principals who are leaving haven't &quot;indicated what their intentions are.&quot; Messrs. Unterberg and Towbin hold a combined 7% of the company's 16.6 million common shares, according to Mr. Schoenthal. Mr. Towbin confirmed that negotiations were proceeding but otherwise declined to comment. Mr. Unterberg couldn't be located for comment.    While moves to diversify the firm into such areas as government and mortgage-backed securities trading had begun under Messrs. Unterberg and Towbin, the two men &quot;weren't wholly committed to those areas,&quot; said Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.    Messrs. Mayer and Schoenthal said that the two departing executives would probably sell their shares, and that the firm would like to either purchase the shares or find buyers. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, L.F. Rothschild closed at $12.50, down 50 cents.    Mr. Schoenthal is credited within the firm for building up its fixed-income capabilities, including government and mortgage-backed securities trading. Last week, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York awarded Rothschild a primary dealership in government securities, making it one of only 40 firms that can buy and sell the instruments as both principals and agents.    Mr. Mayer came to L.F. Rothschild in 1984 from the London-based operation of J. Rothschild Holdings, which owns about 8% of L.F. Rothschild through Carinto Corp. N.V. His ascension indicates an assertion of influence by financier Jacob Rothschild, and the publicly held British firm he controls, over the U.S. firm. Mr. Rothschild's interests held a 50% stake in L.F. Rothschild until earlier this year, when 38% of the company was sold to the public. Mr. Rothschild acquired his stake in the U.S. firm in 1983; before that, L.F. Rothschild hadn't any ties with the European Rothschilds.    The firm, formed in 1899 as L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co., merged in 1977 with C.E. Unterberg Towbin Co., which was founded in 1932. L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin leaped to prominence in the early 1980s underwriting emerging high-technology companies. In 1983, for example, it was lead underwriter for 63 debt and equity issues valued at $2.1 billion, and it was the top underwriter of new high-technology issues, with 18, according to IDD Information Services Inc., New York. This year, however, total lead underwritings are down to 32 issues for a total of $1.25 billion, and the firm hasn't been lead underwriter for a single new high-tech issue.    This doesn't mean, however, that the firm is in dire financial straits. Earnings for the nine months were $15.9 million, or 97 cents a share, up slightly from the year-earlier $15.2 million, or $1.08 a share, on fewer shares outstanding. The firm had a third-quarter loss of $5.4 million, compared with year-earlier profit of $676,000, or five cents a share. The decline largely stemmed from arbitrage reverses, analysts said.    Problems within the firm, industry sources say, result more from conflicts among its executives that began early last year when General Felt Industries Inc. bid for control of L.F. Rothschild.    Mr. Schoenthal, sources said, supported the General Felt bid, while Mr. Unterberg didn't. The bid was rejected, but sources inside and outside the firm say relations between the two men were never the same thereafter.    Mr. Mayer confirmed that there were &quot;tensions&quot; between the two men and said this may have &quot;indirectly&quot; contributed to yesterday's events. But Mr. Schoenthal called that &quot;old news&quot; and said it didn't affect the founders' decision to leave.    In recent months, as the firm has moved away from its high-technology base, strengthening corporate finance and asset-management operations, expanding into mutual funds, adding about 37 mortgage-backed securities traders in the past three months and increasing the amounts of capital available to its government securities business, the conflict between management factions has intensified, sources inside and outside the firm said. </TEXT></DOC>
