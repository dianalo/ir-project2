Up and down the chain of command,the administration has disavowed targeting &quot;any individual&quot;and suggested that to do otherwise would be immoral. But thereality is exactly the opposite. The most morally justifiableact in warfare is the killing of those who are mostresponsible for the war.   The American phobia showed up during the Vietnam war, whenthe Phoenix program sought to identify and kill the leadersof the Vietcong infrastructure in South Vietnam. Liberalsobjected that innocent people were being killed. No doubtsome were. But surely the people killed under the Phoenixprogram were far more responsible belligerents than therank-and-file who died by the tens of thousands on thebattlefield.</LP><TEXT>   For somewhat similar reasons, some within the U.S.government were aghast when they learned that the Afghanmujahideen, to whom we were supplying arms and intelligence,were using both to kill Soviet commanders and politicaladvisers. The product of the same mentality was PresidentGerald Ford's executive order prohibiting the U.S. governmentfrom engaging in assassination. But common sense pointed inthe opposite direction. If it was good for the mujahideen toshoot the masses of miserable Soviet draftees who weretormenting them, why was it bad to shoot those who werecompelling the draftees to do the tormenting?   In 1986, this mistaken morality struck again. AfterLibya's President Moammar Gadhafi ordered the bombing of aBerlin discotheque frequented by American serviceman, theU.S. launched a raid against Gadhafi's headquarters. About100 Libyan soldiers were killed including, said Gadhafi, hisbaby daughter. Then-Secretary of State George Shultzexplained that the U.S. had not intended to kill Gadhafi orto overthrow his government but rather had struck at the&quot;infrastructure&quot; of Libyan terrorism.   But if the U.S. had not intended to kill Gadhafi, whom orwhat precisely did the bombers intend to destroy? Nor did Mr.Shultz explain why it would have been wrong to try to killGadhafi, or what the effect of killing 100 men and a babywould have on terrorism. In fact, after the raid, althoughGadhafi became more effective than ever in Africa, he stoppedtargeting Americans. That wasn't due to any harm to hisinfrastructure but to the fact that we almost got him.   In Panama, moral confusion cost hundreds of lives. InOctober 1989, President Bush, Defense Secretary RichardCheney, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Gen.Colin Powell explained why the U.S. had not been willing toblock one road in Panama City in support of a nearlysuccessful coup against Gen. Manuel Noriega. The reason wasthat they feared that the dictator might be killed and thattherefore the U.S.. would have been tangentially involved inan assassination. Two months later these men found itnecessary to order two divisions to level whole blocks inPanama City, killing hundreds, to capture Noriega.   The essence of both the practical and the moral problem ofwar is &quot;Whom shall we kill and why?&quot; The military art, thevery opposite of indiscriminate killing, consists of strikingthose people and things most likely to stop the enemy fromcontinuing the war. Today, the specialization of weapons andtactics of war make it easier than ever to go after thosewhose death is most likely to stop the killing.   Often, as in the Gulf war, there is no quarrel with theenemy country, only with its chief. In such cases, it is bothfutile and immoral to demolish a country in the hope thatthis will persuade the tyrant to give way. Why not kill thetyrant?   ---   Mr. Codevilla, a fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution,is the author (with Paul Seabury) of &quot;War: Ends and Means&quot;(Basic Books).
