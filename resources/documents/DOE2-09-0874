In the study the authorshave recently reported that respiratory epithelial permeability was similarlyaffected in eight healthy non-smoking young men exposed to ozone (ARRD,135 (1987) 1124-8). Permeability was evaluated by determining the pulmonaryclearance of inhaled aerosolized 99mTc-DTPA with sequential posteriorlung imaging by a computer-assisted gamma camera. In a randomized crossoverdesign, 16 young men were exposed for 2 h to purified air and 0.4 ppmozone while performing intermittent high intensity treadmill exercise;forced vital capacity (FVC) was measured before and at the end of exposures.The results demonstrate that ozone exposure increased respiratory epithelialpermeability. Such an increase may be a manifestation of direct ozone-inducedepithelial-cell injury, lung inflammation, or both.</TEXT></DOC>
