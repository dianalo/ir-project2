(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of protesters jeered and a scufflebroke out as Chippewa Indians went spearfishing under treaty rightsheld since the 1800s.   Law officers broke up the scuffle Tuesday night at the Big EauPleine Reservoir, which Indian fishermen had reached by driving 100miles from their reservation in a 30-vehicle convoy escorted by theState Patrol. No injuries were reported.   An estimated 400 protesters also gathered at a boat landing atLake Nokomis. Three were arrested, two for disorderly conduct andone for property damage, said George Meyer, state Department ofNatural Resources administrator of enforcement.   The protesters object to the Chippewa being allowed to leavetheir reservations and spear walleyed pike, muskellunge and othertrophy-sized fish before the rod-and-reel season begins. Thespearing season began Sunday.   The Indians' treaty rights were upheld in 1983 by a federalcourt.   At the reservoir, on the southern fringe of Indian land deededto the United States in the 1800s, 120 protesters carried an effigywith ``Injun Joe'' on its shirt and held signs that read, ``Spearan Indian, save a walleye,'' ``Equal rights for all Americans'' and``Stop treaty abuse.''   The crowd cheered when someone yelled, ``Let's scalp 'em.''   Spectators were separated from tribal fishermen on a boatlanding by a police ribbon. Many surged forward after a Chippewacrossed in their direction in response to taunts.   About half a dozen uniformed officers moved in and separated theman from the hecklers. He said he was pushed and shoved butunharmed.   ``They taunted me to walk across and I walked across,'' saidDavid Vallier, 29. ``They were just being pretty mean andname-calling.''</TEXT></DOC>
