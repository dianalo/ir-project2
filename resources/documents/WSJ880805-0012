Internal Justice Department documents show that the report, among other things, focused on &quot;narcotic activity involving military authorities&quot; in Panama and a purported plot by U.S. agents more than a decade ago to assassinate Gen. Manuel Noriega, the current Panamanian strongman.    The documents also indicate that Mr. Thornburgh, while he served as head of the department's criminal division, attended a meeting where &quot;it was decided that we should continue to resist disclosing to Congress&quot; certain parts of the report.    The documents -- including memos to Mr. Thornburgh and excerpts of the report itself -- were obtained by The Wall Street Journal. There isn't any suggestion of illegality on Mr. Thornburgh's part, but the documents do raise questions about his handling of matters that could be legally and politically sensitive.    Mr. Thornburgh, whose confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled for today, said through a spokesman earlier this week that he had &quot;no recollection of ever seeing or reviewing&quot; the report or any of the related documents. But after reading some documents provided by this newspaper, the spokesman yesterday said Mr. Thornburgh recalled only that &quot;his involvement in this matter was peripheral,&quot; and that he didn't remember making any &quot;substantive decisions involving the report or its aftermath.&quot;    After reading portions of this material, some members of the committee indicated they would ask Mr. Thornburgh about the documents. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) said the panel should obtain the still-classified report to find out &quot;what it says about drug-running in Panama.&quot; He added that &quot;it's worthwhile pursuing&quot; what Mr. Thornburgh knew about that subject.    In addition to the references to Panamanian drug-running, the report explored whether U.S. drug agents broke the law by using &quot;non-conventional. . .investigative techniques.&quot; It also discussed whether cooperative efforts between the DEA and the Central Intelligence Agency were improper.    But the most provocative questions relate to Mr. Thornburgh's role in informing Congress about the substance of the report. A March 1976 memo recounts a decision -- discussed at a session attended by Mr. Thornburgh, then-Attorney General Edward Levi and other senior Justice Department officials -- to keep from lawmakers information &quot;being reviewed for possible criminal or administrative action.&quot;    However, other documents indicate that months before the high-level Justice Department meeting, Mr. Thornburgh's division already had decided against seeking criminal charges in nearly all of the matters discussed in the report. For instance, a December 1975 memo updating the criminal division's review of the report concluded that the Panamanian drug matters had been closed. &quot;There is no evidence that any overt acts occurred which could be characterized as criminal violations of law,&quot; the memo said of the drug trafficking in Panama.    The memo, one in a series of summaries of the follow-up investigations stemming from the report, apparently was sent to Mr. Thornburgh from Carl Belcher, one of his top deputies at the time. Mr. Belcher, whose name appears on the memo, no longer works at the Justice Department. He said he didn't recall his specific involvement with the report. Mr. Levi couldn't be reached for comment.    The Justice Department declined to comment on the contents of the report, or exactly how its findings were reviewed. But a September 1975 memo to Mr. Thornburgh from Mary Wagner, a special assistant in the deputy attorney general's office, said that &quot;in connection with the criminal division's review,&quot; she was &quot;transmitting herewith copies of transcripts, cassette tapes and steno tapes of testimony&quot; taken by the team that prepared the report.    A 34-item list of materials, which is labeled &quot;Secret andamp; Top Secret&quot; and is believed to be part of the report's supporting evidence, includes a CIA memo discussing the &quot;involvement {of the} family of Gen. Omar Torrijos in narc. trafficking&quot; and a letter detailing the &quot;significance of Republic of Panama in int'l narc. trafficking.&quot; Gen. Torrijos was the leader of Panama when the report was written.    Another document on the list is a paper concerning the alleged plot against Gen. Noriega, who was a top aide to Gen. Torrijos in the mid-1970s. The paper analyzes &quot;options w/respect to immobilization and/or neutralization of Noriega.&quot; Gen. Noriega was indicted earlier this year by two U.S. grand juries on drug-trafficking charges.    Still another memo on the list explores &quot;covert/clandestine intelligence collection capability&quot; by the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, which preceded the DEA.    The main thrust of the report was to catalogue wrongdoing by drug agency personnel, ranging from cheating on travel vouchers and dealing in stolen property to &quot;arranging burglaries and holdups&quot; and promoting one official who had ties to known underworld figures.    Micheal Defeo, a career Justice Department prosecutor and the report's principal author, declined to comment. Thomas Henderson Jr., another author who since has left the government, said in an interview: &quot;I don't have any recollection of discussing (the report) with Dick&quot; Thornburgh.    In November 1975, aides from House and Senate intelligence committees &quot;reviewed various materials relating&quot; to the report, but there isn't any indication that anyone on Capitol Hill had access to the full report. Five years later, in fact, Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) was still complaining that the Justice Department hadn't given him the report and documents dealing with other investigations, maintaining that the agency's resistance amounted to &quot;holding the American people in contempt.&quot;    Panamanian complicity in drug trafficking and the use of U.S. drug agents in intelligence gathering created political problems for outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese and the White House, and promise to be important issues facing the next attorney general.    Despite questions about Mr. Thornburgh's role in withholding the documents, the committee is expected to easily approve his nomination. The former assistant attorney general and two-term Pennsylvania governor, was described by Mr. Reagan as a &quot;prosecutor's prosecutor&quot; and a man with &quot;proven integrity.&quot;    Dubbed &quot;Mr. Clean&quot; by colleagues and praised by his home-town paper in Pittsburgh as &quot;a politician who has remained unsullied by the process of getting and keeping high office,&quot; Mr. Thornburgh was tapped to revitalize the troubled Justice Department. Vice President George Bush and other Republicans are counting on him to help voters forget the ethical problems that bedeviled Mr. Meese. </TEXT></DOC>
