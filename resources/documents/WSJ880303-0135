Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mounting thrift losses are forcing the two major thrift-institution trade groups to consider options for another federal rescue of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.    Capital in FSLIC-insured thrifts fell by more than $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. This indicates that thrift losses in the fourth quarter, which haven't been announced, far exceeded the third quarter's record $1.6 billion, said Martin Regalia, chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions, one of the trade groups.    Losses by insolvent institutions may exceed $9 billion for the year, Mr. Regalia said. Because almost all such losses would have to be covered by the FSLIC unless those thrifts recover, the numbers raise new doubts about the FSLIC's ability to rescue or close insolvent institutions.    The industry's stance constitutes its strongest admission yet that the FSLIC's new authority to raise cash by issuing $10.8 billion in bonds over three years may be inadequate to prevent its collapse. That recapitalization authority became law only last August.    There is no prospect of immediate action on any proposals, however. Congressional leaders aren't willing to reconsider the thrifts' woes so soon after giving the FSLIC the bonding authority. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, parent of the FSLIC, has taken the position that no new federal aid is needed currently. It hopes this year to merge insolvent Texas thrifts at a cost of $6 billion to $7 billion.    The thrift trade groups are seeking ways to resolve ailing thrifts' problems without further burdening the rest of the industry, which already is paying extra insurance premiums. They also are trying to avoid overt reliance on taxpayer funds, partly to ward off any congressional bid to take over assets of the thrift-owned Federal Home Loan Banks.    The National Council of Savings Institutions has endorsed a contingency plan for merging the FSLIC with the stronger Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits in banks. While emphasizing that it isn't advocating the merger, the group said it needs a plan to offer if a merger becomes inevitable. If all else fails, the plan includes provisions for aid from the U.S. Treasury.    The larger U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the other trade group, confirmed a Washington Post report that its officers recently discussed proposals for far-reaching federal aid to insolvent thrifts in the Southwest. They included expanded tax breaks; new federally financed corporations to take over billions of dollars of bad loans; new institutions to take over failed thrifts; and even an embargo on foreign oil to prop up the economy in that oil-producing region.    A league spokesman called these measures only &quot;options&quot; that had been brought up in &quot;the most preliminary type of discussion.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
