Approaches differ bythe choice of projected pattern (dots, stripes, grids, etc.) and thetype of analysis used to extract shape information. A novel approachis reviewed, whereby a sinusoidal grating structure is projected ontoan object, and the resulting deformed grating images are detected bya solid state array camera and analyzed by a microcomputer using digitalinterferometric phase-measuring algorithms. Large arrays of data pointscan be acquired and processed in parallel with very high accuracy andspeed. Two systems are described, one that yields range measurement froma single point of view over a two-dimensional array of points, and asecond that permits full 360 degree measurement. The case of parallellaser light illumination, as well as that of general white light divergingillumination are described. Experimental results and performance analysisare presented.</TEXT></DOC>
