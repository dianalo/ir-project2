Figures released by the American Petroleum Institute after the market closed Tuesday showed that domestic crude oil inventories fell 8.3 million barrels, or about 2.5%, in the week ended Friday. The industry association also reported reductions in distillate and gasoline supplies.    The day's gains in the U.S. market were accelerated by chart-guided technical buying, traders and analysts said.    &quot;It was a sleeper of a market, but then it really woke up,&quot; said Stephen Platt, senior analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. There was &quot;total pandemonium for the last 15 minutes,&quot; a New York trader said.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for May delivery soared 49 cents a barrel to $18.47. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts also posted gains.    Spot, or noncontract, prices also jumped. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. bellwether crude, rose 45 cents, to $18.45 a barrel, while May North Sea Brent, the widely traded European blend, rose 30 cents to $17.75.    The industry report, however, showed a sharp rise in U.S. refinery utilization, to 82.3% of capacity from 80.4% a week earlier, suggesting increased output of refined products in coming weeks, some analysts and traders said. And that is likely to lead to lower prices for distillates and gasoline, analysts said.    The refinery number &quot;eventually will be a factor the market will have to contend with,&quot; said James Ritterbusch, vice president, energy futures, at PaineWebber Inc. in Chicago. &quot;In the meantime, we'll continue to see choppy trading.&quot;    In other futures markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Prices recovered some of their steep losses of the prior two sessions. The upturn came as the stronger dollar allowed bond and bond futures traders a respite from the steep declines of recent days. &quot;The stock market right now is a derivative of the bond market, which is a derivative of the dollar,&quot; said Courtney Smith, director of futures at Twenty-First Securities Corp. in New York. Stocks and stock futures also were helped by bargain-hunting, analysts said. Still, analysts said, with continuing uncertainty about the course of the dollar and interest rates, it is difficult to say if the rebound in index futures can continue.    PRECIOUS METALS: Prices fell on profit-taking after Tuesday's sharp advances. The stronger dollar also helped drive down the prices, analysts and traders said. Much of the trading activity resulted from long liquidation, or selling contracts to offset those bought earlier, ahead of a long weekend, brokers said. All commodity exchanges are closed on Good Friday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery fell $7.80 an ounce to $443.10. May silver slipped 3.5 cents an ounce to $7.245. On the New York Merc, April platinum fell $11.60 an ounce to $591.90. Silver's relatively strong performance yesterday after a 41-cent surge Tuesday suggested that the metal's prospects are particularly bright, some analysts said. &quot;There's the general feeling that silver prices will outpace gold,&quot; said Bette Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. &quot;Speculators keep coming in the market and few traders want to get out,&quot; Ms. Raptopoulos said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat continued to gain, bolstered by talk about possible overseas buying and by concerns about crop conditions in the Soviet Union and elsewhere. Corn and soybeans, though, gave back some of their recent advances. The retreat was a correction of a rally spurred by a weak dollar and rising interest rates dictated by falling bond prices, analysts said. Yesterday, the dollar strengthened and interest rates eased. In addition, analysts said, the markets had overreacted to rumors Tuesday of a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union.    SUGAR: Prices closed higher, with the May contract on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York rising 0.13 cent a pound to settle at 6.98 cents. The May contract had reached the seven-cent-a-pound level, regarded as an important resistance point, before easing. Yesterday's advances occurred despite the Common Market's announcement it wants to sell almost 126,000 metric tons of processed beet sugar. A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds. &quot;The massive tender hardly made an impression on the market,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;The recovery encouraged traders to believe the worst is over and that perhaps prices will go even higher,&quot; Mr. Barakat said. The market's behavior, another analyst said, reflected an ample supply of sugar as well as good demand, which keep prices fluctuating in a modest range. </TEXT></DOC>
