Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead, R-Calif., said the bill provides the``means to assure that the nuclear power option is preserved forthe future.'' It is co-sponsored by eight Republicans and fiveDemocrats, most of whom serve with Moorhead on the House energysubcommittee that will initially consider the bill.   The legislation would reorganize the five-member NuclearRegulatory Commission into a ``Nuclear Safety Agency'' headed by asingle administrator _ a step already approved by a Senatesubcommittee and favored by a majority of the NRC commissionersthemselves. All other federal regulatory agencies are headed byjust one boss, and the NRC's commission format has long come underfire from industry and Congress as too cumbersome.   Unlike the Senate measure, Moorhead's bill would take theadditional step of authorizing one-stop licensing of future nuclearplants if they are built to standard, state-of-the-art designs.   Currently, nuclear plants must be licensed in several stages,from the start of construction to the actual production of poweryears later. That is necessary, in part, because most U.S. plantshave been built to ``custom'' designs _ different from any other _and hence must be given more scrupulous review.   Moorhead's bill would encourage the new safety agency to licenseboth the construction and operation of any plant, subject to normalinspections, which adheres to pre-cleared designs. The system wouldbe similar to those used in France and Japan, both of which relyheavily on nuclear power and produce it more cheaply.   Enormous costs, safety concerns and the lengthy, complicatedlicensing process are among factors blamed for the moribund stateof the U.S. nuclear industry. Though 110 plants are now inoperation and a few are still under construction, no utility haseven applied to build a new plant since 1978.   NRC Chairman Lando Zech and even some critics of nuclear powerhave long argued for plant standardization on both safety andfinancial grounds. Some American firms say they now have thetechnology to design ``meltdown-proof'' reactors, which, ifstandardized, would be less expensive _ perhaps by more than half _than the plants that now require containment structures and massivebackup safety systems.   Moorhead, noting that the U.S. Geological Survey has just cutits estimate of undiscovered oil in the United States by 40percent, said it is ``undeniably clear that in the 1990s andbeyond, this country will have inadequate supplies of electricity.Instead of having oil buried in the ground, it now appears that wehave had our heads buried. It's time we face the facts quickly anddevelop alternative energy supplies.''   Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., pointed to an example in his ownstate as evidence of the advantages offered by plantstandardization. The St. Lucie 2 power plant, built to the samespecifications as its sister, St. Lucie 1, recently was licensedfor operation after $1.5 billion in construction costs, he said.   ``In contrast,'' Bilirakis continued, the Long Island Shorehamplant, which is the same size as St. Lucie 2, cost more than $5billion. If we can keep nuclear plant construction costs below $2billion by building the same design only twice, he said, ``imaginewhat we can save if we build a standardized plant many times over.''   ``We rely on nuclear power for nearly 20 percent of our electricgeneration,'' said Bilirakis. ``Yet, the construction of nuclearpower plants is at a standstill. The volatile situation today inthe Persian Gulf points out that we simply must continue to developdomestic energy sources to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.Safe, reliable nuclear power is the means at hand to do just that.''</TEXT></DOC>
