This is beingput down to the 9release of Turbo Pascal 5.5 in June, since Borland saysthere is always a burst of upgrade interest in Pascal when a new releasecomes out.andP;  On the whole, however, the firm sees object-oriented techniquesmore as an underlying technology for the building of its next generation ofproducts rather than as a micro market grower at the user end.andP;  For example,its Virtual Real-Time Object-Oriented Memory Manager is being built into allof Borland's business products including the Quattro Pro spreadsheet.andO;Borland is terribly excited about the release of Quattro Pro this quarter andis looking for a 10% share of the spreadsheet market over the next fewquarters, primarily at the expense of Lotus Development Corp. It intends toship up to 10,000 units of Quattro Pro per month.andP;  The company says it islooking for between 15% and 20% growth in pre-tax profit year to year, andhas successfully brought its margins and expenses in line with its revenues.andO;It would now like its shares to be evaluated in the light of its products.andO;As for seeking a US listing, following its reincorporation in Delaware andone-for-five consolidation of its shares, permission has been granted for itto sell up to 2.4m shares within the next 15 months.andP;  No material impact isexpected on Borland's business as a result of the earthquake, despite thespell in the parking lot.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
