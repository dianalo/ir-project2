While this approach is most important in field systemssuch as ATM's, hand-held scanners and notebook computers, it maybecome the norm for desktop microcomputers as well.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MicrocomputersSoftware DesignApplications ProgrammingReal-Time Systems.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Hardware columnist Dave Methvin observes in this issue that PCs pop up instrange places.andP;  The cutting edge of workplace productivity is not on thedesk but in the field, and PC software will have to get both tougher andsmarter to keep up with field conditions.andM;One requirement is real-time response.andP;  Real time means that a late answer isa wrong answer.andP;  Field software should give perfect answers if it can, butshould give &quot;quick and dirty&quot; answers when you need them.andM;For example, an automated teller machine normally checks your balance beforeletting you make a withdrawal.andP;  A PC point of view assumes that this is justa lookup in a local database, but the field perspective allows for the factthat data links can go down.andM;You don't want to wait until the ATM can reach the mainframe; rather, the ATMshould check the last balance recorded on your card's magnetic stripe,combined with a code reflecting your banking habits, then make a risk-baseddecision on whether to give you the money.andP;  The cost of occasionally guessingwrong is small compared with the business benefit of higher availability.andM;Sometimes, real-time response involves fundamental research.andP;  Every day,major decisions get made by classical techniques of linear programming.andO;These always get the best answer, in time, but the intermediate solutions canbe terrible.andP;  You would not want to interrupt one of these algorithms andtake its current answer as a best guess -- it could be arbitrarily bad.andM;Under field conditions, you want something completely different: an answerthat is good enough, as soon as you can get it.andP;  You need solutions thatconverge in a well-behaved way, giving you some idea of where they willsettle down.andP;  That way, you can say &quot;Good enough!&quot; when the trend levels off.andO;That takes a different procedure; those who invest that effort today will befirst to the field tomorrow.andM;Ultimately, field software will need to have &quot;common sense.&quot; AI pioneer JohnMcCarthy observes that when he spills a glass of water, he stays dry withoutusing the Navier-Stokes equations to decide which way to dodge.andP;  In thefield, software likewise needs to assess the problem and avoid doing too muchwork.andP;  This takes a knowledge-based approach, rather than brute CPUhorsepower, and poses a continuing challenge for developers.andM;In the near term, though, I'm excited about the platforms available today forsoftware that's always there when you need it.andP;  I'm working with the latestin jacket-pocket PCs, the Hewlett-Packard 48SX calculator -- it has agraphics display, built-in Kermit for serial or infrared communications, 256Kof built-in software and up to 288K of user memory.andM;Those features used to require a full-sized PC, but this one is only 7 by 3by 1 inches and runs on three AAA batteries.andP;  It even turns itself on to beepyou awake in the morning.andP;  Now that's a personal computer.andM;They used to say that the keyboard would limit the minimum size of a usefulPC, but the 48SX has soft keys with built-in and user-definable menus.andP;  Callup the equation for deflection of a beam: A soft key displays a diagram thatshows the role of each variable.andP;  Call up the periodic table of the elements:A soft key recalls the density of aluminum.andM;You wouldn't want to work all day on that keyboard, but the 48SX can connectwith a PC or Mac to transfer data and programs.andP;  I can't wait to see thesoftware that will be written for this thing.andP;  (For further information, calla Hewlett-Packard dealer.andP;  I suggest Educalc, which offers accessories andbooks as well as hardware, and can be reached at (800) 677-7001.)andM;The near-term limits of practical platforms also mean that tight code isstill in style.andP;  Quattro Pro, DR-DOS 5.0 and other innovative productscontinue to prove the market's interest in efficient use of shrinking 16-bithardware.andM;But there's no future for &quot;desk potatoes&quot; -- not hardware, not software, notpeople.andP;  You have to keep up with the action, wherever it may be.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
