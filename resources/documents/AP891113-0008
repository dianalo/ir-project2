Joseph B. Tompkins Jr., chairman of the American BarAssociation's Task Force on Computer Crime, told a congressionalpanel this past week that ``there are clearly some types ofcomputer virus activity that would be beyond the terms of thecurrent statute.''   He and other witnesses outlined a series of activities thatcould fall through the cracks of ambiguous federal laws.   For example, if a computer hacker sends a program laced with ahidden virus to an electronic bulletin board, can he be prosecutedfor harm that results when other bulletin board users transfer thevirus-infected software into their own systems?   Can the hacker be successfully prosecuted if he claims that hereally didn't have any malicious intent, but instead was merelytrying to pull off an innocent prank _ or aiming to demonstrateexisting weaknesses in computer security?   Under current federal law, the answer to both questions is``maybe.''   These are among key issues being considered by the HouseJudiciary subcommittee on criminal justice as it studieslegislation designed to help fight viruses and other forms ofmalicious software.   The panel's chairman, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., said lastweek that computer viruses ``cost industry and government at leastmillions of dollars in damage and disruption ... and yet there isno specific federal criminal statute in place to attack this typeof malicious programming.''   Schumer said afterward that ``it seems to me that presently notenough is going on'' to combat viruses. ``I think the likelihood isthat we will do some kind of legislation,'' he said.   Computer viruses generally are small strings of computer codethat can ``infect'' legitimate computer programs and may causedestruction or alteration of data files.   The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 makes it a federalcrime to ``intentionally access a federal interest computer withoutauthorization and alter, destroy or damage information in suchcomputer or prevent authorized access to such computer if suchconduct causes the loss of $1,000 or more during any one-yearperiod.''   ``Federal interest'' applies to U.S. government computers,computers of financial institutions and cases involving computerslocated in more than one state.   But at last week's hearing, Tompkins said ``the statute does notin clear terms cover the intentional implantation of a computervirus in a computer which one is authorized to access, even if theperpetrator clearly intended harm or the virus in fact causedsignificant harm.''   The question of intent has been raised in the federal court casepending against Robert Tappan Morris, 24, of Arnold, Md.   Morris, who at the time was a Cornell University graduatestudent, has been indicted in connection with the so-called``worm'' which in November 1988 paralyzed about 6,000 computersconnected to the Internet electronic network.   The case is slated to go to trial Nov. 29 in Syracuse, N.Y. Ifconvicted, Morris faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000fine.   Morris' attorney sought to have the indictment dismissed onseveral grounds, contending that Morris did not have the intent tocause losses of $1,000 or more. However, the government argued thatthe statute requires only that the defendant intend to access afederal interest computer without authorization.   Tompkins said ``the fact that the intent requirement ... was thesubject of serious dispute indicates that the provision should bereviewed.''   He said the law also has been attacked as unconstitutionallyvague.   ``While these arguments are probably overstated, clarifying thestatute might prevent such arguments from being raised and mightencourage prosecutors to make more frequent use of the statute,''he said.   Three anti-virus bills are pending in the House, sponsored byReps. Wally Herger, R-Calif.; C. Thomas McMillen, D-Md.; and EdwardJ. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the Energy and Commercesubcommittee on telecommunications and finance.   Herger's bill would impose penalties of up to 20 years in prisonon people convicted of ``interfering with the operations ofcomputers through the use of programs containing hidden commandsthat can cause harm.''   The McMillen measure seeks to punish anyone who ``willfully andknowingly sabotages the proper operation of a computer hardwaresystem or the associated software.'' Markey's bill would make theintroduction of a computer virus into an interstate electronicnetwork a federal crime.   At last week's hearing, the legislative initiatives werestrongly criticized by John L. Pickitt, president of the Computerand Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, aWashington-based industry group whose member companies last yearhad combined sales of more than $230 billion.   ``Like the swine flu vaccine of the 1970s, these anti-virusbills could end up doing more harm than good,'' he testified.   Pickitt contended that ``outlawing some of the programmingtechniques used to create computer viruses might prevent the use ofsimilar programs for beneficial purposes, including countering avirus.''   Also, he said, ``the same sharing techniques which make computernetworks vulnerable to virus attack can also be responsible forbreakthroughs in electronics and telecommunications technology.''</TEXT></DOC>
