David Waite said he believed his 49-year-old brother would befreed this year, and British officials expressed optimism Waite andother British hostages are alive, although there has been nophysical evidence of that.   The leftist Beirut daily As-Safir said four of the 15 foreignhostages were moved from a jail near the city to a new location, butit did not give further details in the unattributed report.   ``To observe a second anniversary is a disappointment, but weremain ever hopeful of his return,'' the Church of England'sspiritual leader, Robert Runcie, said in a nationally broadcastsermon from a London church.   ``We look with hope for the release of all hostages and thoseunjustly imprisoned,'' he said.   Waite's fate has been a mystery since he disappeared Jan. 20,1987 after leaving the Riviera Hotel in west Beirut, apparently tomeet with Shiite Moslems holding some American hostages. It was hisfifth mission to Lebanon.   In the previous 17 months, the 230-pound, 6-foot-7 church envoyhad been credited with obtaining freedom for three U.S. hostages.   But Lebanese officials and some Western sources believe Waite'sprestige had been compromised by news that the Reagan administrationnegotiated freedom for the Rev. Benjamin Weir, the Rev. LawrenceJenco and David Jacobsen by delivering U.S. weapons to Iran.   No group has claimed responsibility for kidnapping Waite, Britishjournalist John McCarthy or Anglo-Irish teacher Brian Keenan, andthere have been no messages from them.   Britain's ambassador in Beirut, Allan Ramsay, said the threeBritons are probably held in ``deplorable conditions, deprived offreedom and most human contact.''   ``There is nothing to suggest they are not alive,'' he was quotedas saying by Britain's domestic news agency Press Association. ``Wehave indications which confirm that, though nothing very recent.''   He called on the kidnappers to release the captives.   ``There is nothing to be gained by continuing to detain thesepeople a moment longer ... There are no bargains to be struck,''Ramsay said in remarks published in Lebanese papers.   Waite's brother said he was satisfied with official efforts togain Waite's release.   ``We are still optimistic,'' he said. ``We believe Terry will beback with us again before the next year goes by.''   Islamic Jihad is the pro-Iranian Shiite faction holding AmericansTerry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, is the hostage held longest.He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Sources said Waite was driven to the home of a Shiite physician,where he was taken hostage.   Hostages freed since then have reported seeing a burly man theybelieved was Waite in an underground prison.   Runcie had expressed concern to Waite about his decision totravel to Beirut ``but was convinced by his determination to go,''church spokeswoman Eve Keatley said Friday.   Runcie asked God to help all hostages and to ``sustain them intheir loneliness, give them courage to face each new day withhope.'' He also prayed for the ``ordinary people'' of Lebanon where``suffering caused by hostage-taking has been known by so manycommunities.''   Iran's closest ally in Lebanon, Sheik Mohammed hussein Fadlallah,was quoted as saying the issue of the foreign captives is ``nowfrozen.'' Fadlallah is spiritual mentor of the Iranian-backedHezbollah, believed to be an umbrella organization for groupsholding hostages.   The Middle East Reporter, an English-language newsletter, saidFadlallah refused to comment further on the hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
