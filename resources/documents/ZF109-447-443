(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Banking on Corporate-Wide PC LANsandM;HISTORICALLY, BANYAN has not been one of the networking companies searchingfor the elusive &quot;Year of the LAN.&quot;andP;  Rather, Banyan sees the key time elementin the development of the PC LAN market as the half decade: the last half ofthe '80s was the period of the workgroup LAN, the first half of the '90s willbe dominated by corporate-wide PC LANs, and the last half of the '90s willusher in the era of the heterogeneous distributed network computingenvironment.andM;While this view is certainly not unique, Banyan may have an opportunity toplay a unique role as the standard bearer for the corporate-wide PC LAN.andM;Banyan executives, having focused from the beginning on the corporate PC LAN,feel that the company is about to enter a period of intense growth andsignificant impact on the market.andP;  In their view, the next few years will bemarked by workgroup LAN vendors (Novell, Microsoft, etc.) trying to scale uptheir offerings to the corporate PC LAN level, while the systems vendors(IBM, Digital, etc.) try to scale down their offerings to fully support PCsas clients and servers.andP;  Banyan's goal is to leverage its headstart intolarge market share, while the others struggle from both above and below tocatch up with the architecture of the early '90s.andM;In this report, we will focus on Banyan's architectural and product goals andthe strategies that the company hopes will propel it into the new decade.andM;The Corporate-WideandM;PC LAN DefinedandM;Banyan looks at the corporate-wide PC LAN not as a collection of separatedepartmental LANs, but as a singly entity.andP;  Though PC-centric (in terms ofboth clients and servers), VINES, Banyan's VIrtual NEtworking System, actsmuch more like an enterprise network (such as SNA or DECnet), with integratedrouting, a global directory service, and centralizable administration andmanagement.andM;VINES LANs are distinguished from the workgroup LANs by size and widegeographical distribution.andP;  The typical PC LAN averages 10 to 20 PCs, whileBanyan's LANs range from 300 to 3000 PCs, with several LANs reaching over10,000 PCs.andM;Another feature of the corporate-wide LAN is the power of the servers--bothin terms of functionality (in addition to file- and print-sharing) and thenumber of users each server can support.andP;  Banyan uses the number of users perserver to claim domination of the &quot;large&quot; PC LAN market--that market segmentdefined by an average of over 30 users per server.andP;  This is also the marketsegment that Banyan claims is now growing the fastest.andP;  The average VINES LANhas 40 users per server and 13 servers per site.andM;The corporate-wide PC LAN is also differentiated by the type of customer itserves and how that customer approaches PC LANs.andP;  Given the size of BanyanLANs, it is axiomatic that its customer base is the Fortune 500.andP;  However,according to Banyan, its PC LANs are generally not departmental purchases, asis typical of a Novell or 3Com customer.andP;  Rather, much of Banyan's appeal isto MIS, since VINES gives MIS the same kind of control that it is used tohaving from mainframe- and mini-based systems.andP;  In addition, VINES appeals todepartmental managers who are looking for a set of advanced features or whoare looking toward connecting their departmental LANs into the corporatenetwork.andM;Thus, the decision to install VINES is often a top-down process.andP;  It is alsomore of a planned process than is the organic growth of most departmental PCLANs.andM;Above all, Banyan claims that, in virtually all cases, its LANs are notsimply resource-sharing devices but are fundamental to the very business ofits customers.andP;  Banyan points out that almost all of these LANs are connectedto mainframes and that Banyan users have the greatest penetration ofelectronic mail of any PC LAN users.andP;  Banyan Mail claims the second largestinstalled base of PC LAN E-mail after cc:Mail.andM;THE VINES ADVANTAGE.andP;  Why does Banyan feel itself so well-positioned for thefirst half of the '90s?andP;  The answer lies in the features that were originallybuilt into VINES, features that distinguish it from the offerings of other PCLAN vendors by supporting the ease-of-use and ease-of-administration oflarge, distributed networks.andP;  In addition, these features are now allowingBanyan to advance its offerings closer towards what companies such as IBM,HP, and Digital have envisioned with the Open Software Foundation (OSF)Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) (see Illustration 5), while allowingits customers to get into its environment today, rather than two years downthe line.andM;These features, which we will examine below, are all outgrowths of anunderlying philosophy that the server should be more than a file and printserver.andP;  The server is the focus of both network services (including file andprint, but also routing, communications, directory, etc.) and the server sideof distributed applications.andP;  This view originally led Banyan to reject DOSas not being powerful enough for a LAN server and to develop VINES on top ofUnix.andP;  This philosophy is also in direct contrast to Novell's traditionalapproach.andM;Novell has, in the past, designed and recommended systems in which thedifferent services and applications reside on separate machines.andP;  The wholeargument over NetWare memory protection comes out of Novell's view--a viewwhich circumstances may be changing--that strategic applications such asdatabases should be run on their own dedicated boxes (see Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  2,for a comparison between Novell and Microsoft on this issue).andM;Four specific features highlight the VINES advantage:andM;* RoutingandM;* DirectoryandM;* Administration and securityandM;* Development toolsandM;(For an examination of VINES architecture, see Vol.andP;  2, No.andP;  6.)andM;ROUTING.andP;  Routing has been called &quot;the magic of VINES,&quot; or what makeslocation independence work.andP;  Each server can act as a router and/or bridge.andO;Routing tables are built and maintained automatically, without administrativeintervention.andP;  Each server, when it comes on line, broadcasts its location toits neighbors.andP;  This is carried along to these servers' neighbors until thenew server is known throughout the network.andM;The routing tables also contain the cost of transmission as well as thenumber of hops--cost is always lowest on the same physical network, and it islikely to be highest across dial-up lines.andP;  Message passing will generallytake the fewest hops.andP;  If two routes have an equal number of hops, then costis considered.andP;  This is always dynamically calculated, so that, if one routebecomes unavailable, another is used.andP;  If the first route comes back up, themessages are immediately redirected along that route (assuming it had beenthe shorter route or less expensive in the first place).andM;Updates of the routing tables take place at layer 3, making it topologicallyindependent.andP;  VINES uses its own Routing Update Protocol (RTP), which isbroadcast every 30 seconds.andM;The great advantage of automatic routing is the administrative savings, bothin time and personnel.andP;  In addition, it allows the automatic merging of twonetworks when separate departments or companies decide that they want to beable to more closely communicate, or when two companies merge.andM;DIRECTORY.andP;  Banyan is best known for StreetTalk, its global distributednaming service.andP;  StreetTalk maintains the names and attributes of all objectson the network, including users, file volumes, servers, services, andcommunications ports.andP;  This means that network security and administrationare intregal parts of the naming system, making administration of largenetworks possible, if not easy.andM;StreetTalk is a very powerful database: Each user ID can have up to 1,024assorted fields, including security, access rights, aliases, personal addressbook, and login profiles.andP;  Other elements can be controlled throughStreetTalk, such as an Oracle ID, Unix ID, SNA ID, etc.andP;  StreetTalk alsocontains services names--Oracle has a StreetTalk name giving locations, wherefiles are stored, and an access list.andP;  StreetTalk names are designated byItem@Group@Organization.andM;StreetTalk is the key element in providing location transparency throughoutthe network.andP;  In addition, administration is made easier, since allinformation about a user or service is maintained in a single place, yet iseasily accessible from anywhere else.andM;Most importantly, StreetTalk enables very large networks.andP;  The alternativesto the StreetTalk architecture are to have a single name server, to replicatethe name database throughout the network, or to divide the network intosubnetworks and use gateways between them.andP;  The last approach has beenrejected out of hand by Banyan, whose whole philosophy is based on a singleview of a single PC LAN from any place on the LAN.andP;  In the large network, thefirst option, a single name server, would, in addition to providing a singlepoint of failure, create tremendous performance delays.andP;  And, if the wholename database is replicated throughout the network, the resulting replicationtraffic might make all other work impossible.andM;The VINES distributed name service works as follows: Each user (or server,services, communications gateway, etc.) is assigned a home server, the serverwhere his or her Group is maintained in the local StreetTalk database.andP;  Aswith routing information, Group-level information is automatically broadcastto all other StreetTalk servers--any number of VINES servers can beStreetTalk servers.andP;  Thus, when user A@B@C wants to find a user or a serviceX@Y@Z (most probably through an alias), the request goes to the nearestStreetTalk server (not necessarily the home for Group B), which routes it tothe home StreetTalk server for Group Y.andM;The one drawback of this system is that if the home server for Group B isdown, user A@B@C cannot log into the network at all.andP;  According to Banyan,this only infrequently creates problems because the bulk of a group's datagenerally resides on the same server as the local StreetTalk database.andP;  Thus,if the server goes down, the major applications are also down, making theaccess question less important.andP;  We feel, however, that in a trulydistributed network, the architecture should assure that users are not lockedout of services that may still be available on other servers on the network.andO;It appears that Banyan will address this issue in the future (see &quot;StreetTalkDirectory Assistance&quot; below).andM;ADMINISTRATION AND SECURITY.andP;  The combination of StreetTalk and the automaticrouting makes the daily administration of VINES much easier than on most PCLANs, particularly as the LANs grow large.andP;  This can show up both in thenumber of administrators needed and the level of training they require.andO;According to Banyan, VINES requires fewer administrators than doworkgroup-oriented PC LANs, and it cites a customer that has an equal numberof Banyan LANs and LANs from another popular vendor.andP;  This customer has 35administrators for the &quot;other&quot; LANs and 4 for the Banyan LANs.andP;  These kindsof numbers have been corroborated by the users we talked to who have bothVINES and other PC LANs.andM;Administration can be centralized, distributed, or a combination of both.andP;  Inthe last case, a central administrator can designate local administrators whomight have fewer responsibilities and limited access to secure areas.andP;  Allthis, of course, is designated via StreetTalk attributes.andM;VINES administration is a client/server application that provides a fullsuite of administration tools, any of which can be reached from any PC on theLAN.andP;  The application has two parts, one of which gives any user informationabout the network, the other aimed specifically at administrators.andM;The information available to the user includes:andM;* ProtocolsandM;* Memory contentsandM;* CPU usageandM;* Packet throughputandM;* RoutingandM;* Disk utilizationandM;* Modems, printers, etc.andM;In addition, the automatic routing update facility can be dynamically used todraw an up-to-date topology map.andM;An administrator with management access rights for a server can stop or startany service, add services, and view information such as errors, audit trails,debugging, status, security violations, message traffic, and physical changesto the system.andP;  However, the access rights can be made more granular, as eachservice has a management access rights list as well as a user access rightslist.andP;  Management of any server can take place from any PC on the network.andM;Security is handled by VANGuard, a security system based on access lists.andO;The access rights are generally at the group level and control access tofiles, communications services, printers, or any other service.andP;  These listsof access rights are maintained by StreetTalk and are automatically updatedthroughout the network.andM;A key benefit of the access rights lists is that VINES administrators do nothave to use passwords to control access rights to network resources.andP;  Thus,because access rights are controlled by group rather than individualprofiles, far less labor is required to control access rights on a largenetwork.andP;  In a password-based security system, new passwords must bedistributed (itself a security problem) to many individuals every time aservice is added or a change is made.andP;  Logon passwords can still be used tolimit initial access to the network; these passwords are changeable by theuser or administrator.andM;VINES security includes:andM;* User account expiration dateandM;* Limit on the number of simultaneous workstations per userandM;* Dial-in securityandM;* Can/Cannot modify profileandM;* Can/Cannot modify passwordandM;* Specific location and/or time of day or week user login restrictionsandM;* Password management: length, expiration, forced password change on firstloginandM;* Password encryption with no session replayandM;* Unauthorized login protection and trackingandM;* Restricted network mergerandM;Restricted network merger is necessary because VINES's transparent routingautomatically merges separate networks, a situation that is not alwaysdesirable.andP;  The network manager can restrict flow between two segments tospecific users or services, with only an E-mail connection as a commonscenario.andM;DEVELOPMENT TOOLS.andP;  From the beginning, Banyan recognized the need to providetools for developers to build applications on top of VINES services.andP;  A keyelement in this was called Matchmaker (since renamed NetRPC), which is acombination of a protocol specification language and RPC compiler (seeIllustration 1).andP;  NetRPC has been important, in enabling Banyan-developedservices and products from third parties.andM;Banyan also provides a complete Unix System V development kit (see&quot;Applications Toolkit&quot; below) and has opened up most of its APIs to thirdparties and users.andM;VINES as a Development PlatformandM;Banyan is aware that as the industry reaches general agreement on the lowerlayers of network connectivity, vendors will have to distinguish themselvesby the services that they can offer both to users and to developers who areimplementing distributed solutions.andM;Banyan sees its differentiation falling into five areas:andM;* Advanced architectureandM;* Applications portabilityandM;* ToolkitandM;* MailandM;* DatabasesandM;ADVANCED ARCHITECTURE.andP;  Banyan views its advanced architecture as a keyattraction for both internal developers and ISVs.andP;  The company sees theadvanced services, such as StreetTalk and what Banyan calls SNM (systems andnetwork management), as elements enabling developers to move out of theworkgroup arena and to begin addressing corporate needs.andM;Banyan points to an emerging class of PC LAN applications such as LotusNotes, which requires a corporate commitment rather than departmental orworkgroup implementation (Notes is sold with a minimum license of 200 users),as needing the VINES architecture.andP;  One of the problems that Lotus has thusfar faced is the fact that the current generation of PC LANs (Notes runs onNovell, 3Com, and IBM PC LANs) requires the application developer to spendmore time making the LAN work correctly than on implementing the softwareitself.andP;  Banyan claims that the VINES architecture and services wouldautomatically solve this problem for the software developer.andP;  We cannotevaluate this claim, since Notes does not yet run on VINES.andP;  However, Lotusis very interested in VINES as a development platform.andM;In addition, the support that Banyan builds in for multiple applicationsrunning on the server is likely to attract server-based applicationsdevelopers.andP;  This is particularly true of those applications that may becompute intensive and, therefore, could benefit from VINES's multiprocessingsupport.andP;  (See &quot;Multiprocessing and VINES 486,&quot; below.)andM;APPLICATIONS PORTABILITY.andP;  Banyan is counting on the fact that VINES is Unixbased (currently System V.3.2 Version 2.1, and committed to Posix and SystemV.4) to attract developers, particularly database vendors.andP;  VINES is designedto have multiple processes run on the server, and, according to Banyan,moving a Unix server-based application to VINES is an easy port.andP;  Inaddition, the loss of momentum suffered by OS/2 due to LAN Manager's lack ofsuccess on the server side and to Microsoft's emphasis on Windows 3.0 on theclient side is likely to send many developers who were considering OS/2looking for a Unix platform.andP;  Here, VINES is likely to find competition fromLM/X and Portable NetWare, both of which can claim to offer features similarto VINES on a Unix network.andP;  However, the degree of integration of VINESfeatures is unlikely to be found on these platforms soon.andM;APPLICATIONS TOOLKIT.andP;  The VINES Applications Toolkit provides developerswith a full Unix System V development environment, including Unix System V, Ccompiler, Assembler, Linker, Debugger, Bourne or C Shell, and a set of Unixutilities.andP;  Client development uses Microsoft C.andM;The toolkit also provides a Unix/DOS Bridge File Service, which allowsDOS-based programs to share and interchange source code with the Unixenvironment.andP;  This permits application development to occur simultaneously onboth client and server platforms, using a common set of source code anddatafiles.andM;Most importantly, the toolkit provides developers access to VINES servicesAPIs and VINES RPC facilities.andM;APIs.andP;  Banyan provides many APIs for VINES services.andP;  APIs currently open fordevelopers include interfaces to:andM;* StreetTalkandM;* StreetTalk Directory AssistanceandM;* International NamingandM;* Mail and Mail GatewaysandM;* VANGuard Security ServiceandM;* VINES Socket CommunicationsandM;* File and Print ServicesandM;* TCP/IP and X.25andM;* 3270/SNA Services (client only)andM;RPCs.andP;  One of Banyan's early strengths was the inclusion of an RPC mechanismand protocol compiler.andP;  Originally called Matchmaker, the VINES NetRPCincludes:andM;* Schema Language, which defines interfaces (similar to ASN.1)andM;* Schema Compiler, which outputs C code for clients and servers for X86 DOS,X86 OS/2, 386 Unix, 680X0 Unix, and VAX Unix (Berkeley)andM;* Tasker, which schedules multiple incoming RPC requestsandM;Virtually all of the VINES services, including Mail, StreetTalk, StreetTalkDirectory Assistance (STDA), VANGuard, and all mail gateways, have been builtusing the NetRPCs.andP;  ISVs have also used NetRPC.andP;  For example, Oracle usesNetRPC for initial connection setup (direct I/O is then done via a socketinterface).andM;Banyan is looking at migrating its Schema Language to be compatible withASN.1.andP;  The company is less certain about implementing connectivity to theNetWise RPC.andP;  NetWise does have a set of products that support VINESprotocols.andM;MAIL.andP;  For Banyan, Mail is both a service and a platform upon which to buildother services.andP;  Banyan's Mail API allows developers to build front ends tothe VINES Message Transfer Agent (MTA) and access the mail gateways runningon the server.andP;  Banyan is working with ISVs to develop mail-enabledapplications, such as mail-filtering and workflow automation.andM;DATABASES.andP;  Banyan is working with database vendors to port and enhance theirproducts for VINES servers.andP;  Banyan sees the availability of these databaseengines on its servers as an important enticement for other developers to puttheir applications on VINES as well.andM;In addition, Banyan hopes that its emphasis on intelligent data access anddata migration features will strengthen its story as a platform both fordistributed databases and for data-intensive applications.andM;VINES 4.0 EnhancementsandM;VINES 4.0, announced last year, provides a number of enhancements, includingbetter performance, Windows 3.0 and future OS/2 client support, and expandedoptions for PC dial-in access.andP;  The highlights of the new release areStreetTalk Directory Assistance, support for multilingual networking,enhanced IBM connectivity, and symmetric multiprocessing support.andM;STREETTALK DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE.andP;  End users are particularly excited by thenew StreetTalk Directory Assistance (STDA).andP;  STDA provides users with an easyway to look up any user, service, or resource on the network.andP;  STDA is aserver-resident subset of StreetTalk that is updated with name and locationchanges only.andP;  Performance is much faster than directly accessing StreetTalkbecause STDA does not have to query remote servers for non-local entities.andO;In addition, STDA has an easy interface that allows users to browse or to usepartial names to find the desired item.andM;STDA is directly integrated into the Banyan Mail service, allowing users todirectly select entries from STDA to be put into the mail address file.andO;According to Alan King, director of Wide Area Networking for the Commonwealthof Massachusetts, STDA has greatly increased use of the mail service on theCommonwealth's VINES LAN.andM;STDA can be loaded as a terminate/stay resident (TSR) application, enablingusers to access it from anywhere within the VINES environment.andP;  An open APIallows third-party or internally developed applications to use STDA directly.andM;Unlike StreetTalk itself, STDA databases are maintained by replication.andP;  Itis likely that Banyan will extend the experience it gains with replication tomove StreetTalk itself to a replicated architecture, thus eliminating thepossibility that a single point of failure will prevent a set of users fromlogging on to the network.andM;MULTILINGUAL VINES.andP;  Banyan is particularly proud of its efforts in the areasof internationalization and multilingualism.andP;  The company sees this not onlyas a service to its multinational clients (a large proportion of its customerbase) and a competitive advantage over other noninternationalized PCnetworking products, but also as a way to extend the reach of PC LANs inforeign countries.andP;  For example, in Germany, union contracts stipulate thatcompanies must pay higher wage rates to workers who work with a foreignlanguage.andP;  In many cases, the introduction of a LAN, with its menus andresponses in English, was not deemed cost effective due to the increasedwages it would require.andP;  The German version of VINES eliminates this barrier,and, according to Axel Schultze, president of Asonic, the Banyan countrypartner in Munich, companies such as Siemens are now planning to make a majormove to PC LANs.andM;Multilingual VINES is built around the ISO 8859/1 standard for 8-bitcharacter sets (previously, VINES supported 7-bit characters only).andP;  The8-bit characters are supported for all VINES menus and status messages.andP;  Inaddition, Multilingual VINES accommodates a wide variety of language rules,including language-specific and location-specific sorting, case sensitivity,and numeric display.andP;  It also supports international time and date formats,accounting automatically for time zones, daylight savings time, andappropriate modes for presenting time, data, month, and year.andM;Most exciting is StreetTalk's support for the full international characterset, which provides a single user or resource name regardless of language oraccents.andP;  This allows users in different countries (or of different languagesin the same country) to easily address each other.andP;  For example, a Germanuser, Hans Muller, could be addressed as Hans Muller by other Germans orlanguages that support the &quot;u&quot;.andP;  At the same time, he could be addressed asHans Muller by an English user or a user whose language or keyboard does notsupport a &quot;u&quot;.andP;  StreetTalk transparently takes care of the differences.andM;In its initial implementation, VINES will support five languages per server(English and up to four others) and an unlimited number of languages inmultiserver networks.andP;  The first languages to be released will be German andFrench, others will follow soon.andP;  Banyan is providing a toolkit fordeveloping other language versions.andP;  These are generally being done byBanyan's distribution partner in each country to yield a singleBanyan-authorized version for each language and locality.andM;Banyan is looking to the next generation of multilingual VINES, which willsupport 16-bit character sets, required for Kanji, Korean, Hebrew, Arabic,etc.andM;ENHANCED IBM CONNECTIVITY.andP;  Most of the enhancements for IBM connectivity arein the Token-Ring area, with new security and Bisync support also beingadded.andP;  The new additions include:andM;* IBM 3174 Emulation/Token-Ring Attach, which allows a VINES server tocommunicate with an SNA host over Token-Ring through a 3174 or 3745/372Xcontroller.andP;  This enables the utilization of a single Token-Ring forPC-to-host as well as PC-to-server traffic.andM;* Source Level Routing, which enables VINES servers and clients tocommunicate across IBM Token-Ring bridges to a remote VINES server.andM;* Token-Ring Bridging Software Option, which supports VINES servers assource-level routers between Token-Rings.andP;  This replaces the need for adedicated Token-Ring bridge.andM;* 3270 Physical Location Security, which adds physical location security toBanyan's VANGuard service.andP;  This enables administrators to restrict a user'sSNA access while still allowing the user to log in from multiple locations.andM;MULTIPROCESSING AND VINES 486.andP;  Next month, Banyan plans to release a versionof VINES that will support symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) on VINES serverhardware.andP;  The first release will support the two 386/486 processors of theCompaq SystemPro, however, the software is capable of supporting up to eightprocessors.andM;Banyan sees this as a large advantage over Novell and Microsoft, which areimplementing multiprocessing as an asymmetric process (for the differencebetween symmetric and asymmetric, see Illustration 2).andP;  One of the reasonsfor this is philosophical.andP;  Novell sees multiprocessing essentially as a wayto implement fault tolerance; Microsoft sees it as a way to increase the I/Operformance of LAN Manager 2.0; and the Banyan philosophy is to have theserver run all of the key services and applications.andM;The other reason is technical.andP;  Unix provides a better platform to implementSMP.andP;  Not that this was easy: Banyan had to modify its Unix kernel toaccommodate SMP, basically rewriting the Unix scheduler.andP;  The VINES SMPimplementation requires shared memory multiprocessors.andP;  (For more on theissues and approaches to implementing SMP on Unix, see Unix in the Office,Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  2.)andM;Banyan's initial tests show a two-processor performance averaging nearly 1.6times that of a single processor.andP;  Actual performance will depend on how manyapplications are run and how compute-intensive these are, with Banyan havingachieved results of up to 1.9 times performance in highly computationalapplications.andM;The SMP version of VINES is initially aimed at servers that hold largeStreetTalk databases, are hubs or routers in large systems, are SNA gateways,or hold any Unix database.andM;VINES 486.andP;  Banyan has also recently shipped a 486-specific version of VINES.andO;Again aimed at the high-end server and distributed applications, VINES 486takes advantage of the 486 chip to increase performance to about double a386.andP;  Interestingly, VINES/386 will not run on a 486 server.andP;  Users of the486 have to pay the higher price for the 486 version, creating two pricelevels.andP;  Banyan's explanation is that 386 users should not have to pay for486 features.andM;Another interpretation might go like this: If a 386 server supports 50 usersand a 486 server supports 100 users, then a network OS vendor will sell halfas many licenses on 486machines as it will on 386machines to support the samenumber of users.andP;  If the network OS is priced the same, this could result ina loss of revenue.andM;Whether other companies will follow in creating two-tiered pricing andwhether users accept it are still to be seen.andM;STILL MISSING.andP;  While VINES 4.0 goes a long way towards reaching thelong-term goals, some significant pieces are still missing.andP;  These are mostnotable in the interoperability area, with Macintosh, Unix client, NetWare,and APPC support high on the list.andM;Goals for VINESandM;From its inception, two specific philosophical goals have driven theevolution of VINES.andP;  These are: (1) to provide the user with transparentaccess to all network services, and (2) to create a network that runs itself.andO;With each generation of the product, Banyan has tried to move closer to thesegoals.andM;In the time frame of the first half of the '90s, Banyan sees five dimensionsto the realization of these goals:andM;* Interoperability and standardsandM;* Heterogeneous client/server computingandM;* Systems servicesandM;* Data accessandM;* MessagingandM;While Banyan is investing different amounts of resource in the differentareas, all five dimensions are equally important conceptually to the ultimatedelivery of VINES pushed to its logical extent.andP;  Banyan's goal is not only tobuild up its offerings in each dimension, but also to add intelligence toeach, making the system more and more responsive and responsible.andM;We will look at each area in turn, discussing Banyan's strategy and lookingat some examples of how the company plans to implement it.andM;INTEROPERABILITY AND STANDARDS.andP;  VINES is able to provide a large degree ofconnectivity because VINES servers are built to handle multiple protocols atthe lower levels.andP;  Initially supporting its own IPC transport and thenTCP/IP, VINES will soon feature a full OSI transport implementation upthrough TP4 and including FTAM.andP;  In addition, as we shall see in the nextsection, Banyan is planning support for additional systems such as AppleTalk.andM;Banyan's approach to standards is marked by a combination of nativeimplementation of many standard protocols and gateways to others.andP;  Thedecision on which protocols to implement natively rests on &quot;how stable thestandards are.&quot;andP;  Where the standards are determined to be stable, such as thelower OSI levels, Banyan will implement the native support (in the OSI case,focusing on performance and reliability at the transport and network layer).andO;Where the standards are still evolving, sepcifically X.400 and X.500, theinitial implementation will be via gateways, with native implementation tocome later, if deemed necessary for performance.andM;StreetTalk And X.500.andP;  Banyan's view of the relationship between StreetTalkand X.500 is an instructive example of this approach.andP;  First, Banyan is quickto note that X.500 and StreetTalk have very similar architectures andfunctionality, both having conceptually sprung from Xerox Parc'sClearinghouse.andP;  The position is that, for the foreseeable future, StreetTalkis more appropriate for a homogeneous network, while X.500 is the propermethod for heterogeneous networks to exchange directory information.andM;The plan (see Illustration 3) is, therefore, for StreetTalk to become a fullDirectory Service Agent (DSA) for X.500.andP;  This will make StreetTalk look likean X.500 service to any outside OSI systems while not affecting internal use.andO;In addition, direct interfaces to other name services may be implemented toavoid the two gateways that could be involved if X.500 were used as thego-between.andP;  This is most likely where there is a large installed base usingthe other name services--i.e., NetWare.andM;At the same time that this plan is being implemented, StreetTalk itself willevolve so that it is closer to X.500.andP;  The first (and, according to Banyan,the most important) step in this process is to change StreetTalk'sthree-level naming scheme--&quot;Item@Group@Organization&quot;--to an n-level scheme tomatch X.500's naming scheme.andP;  This is being done by allowing prefixes andsuffixes in the current StreetTalk format.andP;  The full name will be carried forcommunications between StreetTalk and X.500, while, within a StreetTalknetwork, the prefixes and suffixes will be stripped away.andM;IBM Interoperability.andP;  VINES provides a wide range of 3270-based services,including HLLAPI and LLAPI, with VINES 4.0 providing significant new IBMconnectivity features (see &quot;Enhanced IBM Connectivity,&quot; above).andP;  VINES doesnot yet support APPC, though Banyan is committed to eventually providing it.andO;The first steps, due next year, include support for NT2.1 and all of the LUsfrom 0 to 7 (including LU6.2).andM;Banyan has also committed support for IBM's LAN Server, which itself willsoon converge with Microsoft's OS/2 LAN Manager.andM;VINES and LAN Manager, NetWare, etc.andP;  Banyan and Microsoft recently concludedan agreement that specified a commitment towards compatibility andinteroperability between VINES and LAN Manager.andP;  The initial implementationwill take place on VINES servers, allowing LAN Manager clients to access fileand applications on VINES servers, and server-based applications on VINES andLAN Manager to talk to each other.andP;  It will also assure that applicationswritten for LAN Manager will run on VINES networks.andM;This is being done by completing the support for the suite of Microsoftprotocols on VINES servers.andP;  These protocols include SMB, NETBIOS, NamedPipes, Mailslots, NETBEUI, and NDIS protocols.andM;In this implementation, VINES clients will not be able to access directly LANManager servers.andP;  Banyan's position is that clients wishing to access bothLAN Manager and VINES servers should be LAN Manager clients or VINES clientsrunning both the VINES and LAN Manager redirectors.andM;Banyan has not talked much about interoperability with LM/X, though itspresident, David Mahoney, sees it as a &quot;logical extension to our currentagreement with Microsoft.&quot;andP;  However, he does note that while Banyan is not incompetition with Microsoft in the workgroup space, it could be competing withUnix mini vendors with an LM/X strategy.andM;The Banyan/Microsoft relationship raises some interesting issues.andP;  The twocompanies have talked about &quot;exchanging advanced network specifications andproduct plans to guide their development of future networking products.&quot;andO;Will Microsoft, whose products have not been affected at this point,eventually incorporate some of Banyan's technologies--we would suggestStreetTalk--into future versions of LAN Manager?andP;  (Microsoft recentlyannounced that it was seeking outside technologies to bolster LAN Managerfeatures.)andP;  If so, will this bring Microsoft and Banyan into competition forthe corporate PC LAN?andP;  Or, perhaps, is the acquisition of Banyan onMicrosoft's wish list?andM;Banyan's position on NetWare is less clear than its LAN Manager support; but,because of Novell's market share, Banyan's position here is more important.andO;Banyan has a number of options.andP;  It could support VINES clients for NetWareservers by putting IPX on the client or an IPX gateway on the VINES server,but there is little interest in VINES clients running off of NetWare servers.andO;The crucial area for Banyan is direct support for NetWare clients to vINESservers and services, including StreetTalk.andP;  In the long run, Banyan islikely to implement a native IPX stack on the VINES server.andP;  The timing maybe more a political than a technical issue.andM;Currently, some interoperability between VINES and NetWare is achievablethrough a pair of gateways from Trellis.andP;  Each gateway--one for VINESclients' file requests to NetWare servers, the other for NetWare clients'file requests to VINES servers--runs on a dedicated DOS PC, which can alsoserve as a bridge between two topologies (see Illustration 4).andP;  The gatewayssupport file access, including the ability for users to run applicationsstored on the other network's server.andP;  However, the gateways do not supportVINES clients using NetWare applications that require IPX/SPX, the bindery,or other Novell-specific features; nor do they support NetWare clients usingapplications requiring VINES IP or other VINES-specific features.andM;A similar solution is available for VINES to VAX/VMS connectivity.andP;  TheMobius VINES/VAX integration software from FEL Computing provides VINES userswith VAX file, print, file transfer, and terminal emulation services.andP;  VMSusers can access files and printers on VINES servers.andP;  Mobius provides anopen API for developers to utilize VAX and VINES resources within the sameapplication.andM;Banyan has a very interesting long-term vision of servers supporting multiplePC clients.andP;  Banyan asserts that, at some point in the future, clientnetworking software will come as part of the PC operating system, just as itdoes on the Mac.andP;  There is strong feeling that this client software will looka lot like LAN Manager, since Microsoft controls the operating system, thoughit is not impossible that NetWare calls might be natively supported.andP;  In anycase, Banyan sees the likely result as a single client API to which allservices will be written.andM;VINES and DCE.andP;  Banyan has a rather ambivalent attitude towards the OSF DCEofferings.andP;  On the one hand, Banyan claims that VINES implements all of thekey DCE technology categories and is available today, rather than being ayear or two away (see Illustration 5).andP;  In addition, VINES as a Unixapplication is committed to Unix V.4 compatibility, rather than alignmentwith the DCE sponsors.andM;On the other hand, Banyan recognizes that many of the DCE technologies willeventually be implemented and that VINES will have to interoperate with them.andO;Banyan is particularly sensitive to the RPC issue, with the Network ComputingSystem (NCS) RPC support and a move towards ASN.1 for data representationdefinitely on its long-term agenda.andP;  In addition, Banyan is closely lookinginto adding support for the Andrew File System (AFS) to its support for theNetwork File System (NFS) and Remote File System (RFS), though it wouldrather wait for AFS to be adopted into Unix V.4 than have to write its ownsupport.andP;  Other areas, such as security, are likely to be dealt with throughgateways, rather than directly.andM;HETEROGENEOUS CLIENT/SERVER COMPUTING.andP;  While Banyan is committed to supportfor multiple clients and servers within the VINES environment, it has beenvery slow in its implementation.andP;  Of the PC LAN vendors, Banyan has been lastor near last in support for both OS/2 and Macintosh clients.andP;  In addition,until the OS/2 server support ships, VINES cannot support OS/2 server-basedapplications such as Lotus Notes, Saros FileShare, or the OS/2 SQL Serverfrom Sybase.andM;Complete Client Support.andP;  One of the reasons for the implementation delays,particularly the Mac client support, has been Banyan's ambitious plan toprovide transparency between different file systems.andP;  When finallyimplemented (see Illustration 6), the VINES File System will not only providenative support for each client type, but will allow any file created by anyclient to be viewed by any other client (assuming the proper permissions).andO;This is not a trivial matter.andP;  Not only are there logical differences on howa file is handled (with the obvious example of the Mac's data fork andresource fork files, where two files are needed to store Mac data), but alsofile-naming differences that make it difficult for a file created in onesystem to be recognized by another.andP;  For example, a DOS application has agreat deal of trouble dealing with a long file name created in Unix, OS/2, orthe Mac.andP;  Banyan's goal is to make this transparent between any systems,using the emerging conventions for file name translation where available anddeveloping its own where necessary.andP;  (This is a similar approach to the onetaken by Novell with the Universal File System of NetWare 386 3.1, whichsupports multiple name spaces.)andM;In addition, different file systems support different security levels--someare implemented at the directory/subdirectory level, some at the file level.andO;In order to provide full native file support, Banyan is adding file-levelsupport to VINES's current subdirectory-level security.andM;Another delay in the Mac support was caused by Apple's release of AppleTalkVersion 2.andP;  Since Banyan had committed to full AppleTalk routing withinVINES, it had to rewrite much of the in order to bring it into line with thenew release.andM;Currently, Macs can be hooked to a VINES network via a third-party gateway,MACLAN Connect.andP;  The MacVINES Mail Gateway is available to connect Macintoshmail packages to Banyan's mail system.andP;  Unix workstations can currently beconnected as VINES clients through DOS-emulation software.andM;&quot;Portable VINES&quot;?andP;  Although Banyan is not ready to announce non-Unix VINESservers, its long-range plans are for VINES to run on multiple operatingsystems atop multiple hardware architectures.andP;  Banyan currently has286/386/486-specific versions and a 680X0 version.andP;  VMS, other Unix (i.e.,andO;RISC) architectures, and the coming 32-bit OS/2 are likely candidates forVINES ports.andP;  It is unlikely that these systems will be done through OEMagreements.andP;  In order to assure consistent releases, Banyan would ratherprovide direct support.andM;For users, the portability issue is also a scalability issue.andP;  While theywould like to be able to run VINES on all of their existing platforms, theyare equally focused on having the ability to run larger and larger serversand applications.andM;SYSTEMS SERVICES.andP;  For Banyan, the area of systems services is a keydifferentiator from the workgroup LAN offerings.andP;  Banyan stresses that itsservices must be both distributed and centrally manageable.andP;  Areas ofconcentration include directory, security, and systems and network management(SNM).andM;Directory.andP;  StreetTalk is a key component of VINES.andP;  It is itself adistributed service that is utilized by virtually all of the other VINESservices (see Illustration 7).andP;  As we saw above, VINES is being enhanced tomap more closely to the X.500 standard.andP;  In addition, there are indicationsthat StreetTalk may be redesigned to support some level of databasereplication, so that users will be able to logon to the network even if theirprimary server is down (see &quot;StreetTalk Directory Assistance,&quot; above).andM;Security.andP;  Security within VINES is handled by the VANGuard service incombination with StreetTalk.andP;  Though passwords are used to get into thesystem, VINES security is built on an access list paradigm, with each item's(user, server, service, etc.) list part of the StreetTalk database.andP;  Banyan'sgoal is to enhance the security to bring it to the level of &quot;Trusted System,&quot;a status obtainable only by access list-based systems.andM;Systems and Network Management.andP;  Banyan's goal for SNM is to make itdistributed, centralizable, intelligent, and automatic.andP;  Building on thecurrent distributed self-administration features (such as the automaticupdates of the StreetTalk databases as new items are added, deleted, ormodified), Banyan plans to enhance the ability to manage the networkcentrally.andP;  This involves the not-so-easy issues of implementing centralizedadministration, security, and accounting within an essentially distributedmodel.andM;Accounting is one of the areas that is most interesting to Banyan; thecompany sees this as one of the key services it will be able to offer beforeits competition does.andP;  Again, StreetTalk is likely to be an integral part ofthe accounting services.andM;While VINES implements its own network management, Banyan is aware that itmust play in the larger network management standards arena.andP;  Banyan's plan isto have SNM manage the VINES network, and, through gateways, report toenterprise-wide network management systems such as NetView and UNMA (seeIllustration 8).andP;  Banyan does not foresee SNM managing other managementsystems.andP;  The initial implementation is likely to provide status reports,such as alert form SNM, to the other management system, with control of SNMby other systems being implemented later.andP;  Banyan is cautions of moving toofast in giving other systems control of their own management.andM;DATA ACCESS.andP;  Banyan is looking at the data access dimension in two ways.andO;First, it is working closely with several relational database vendors toenhance performance and enable truly distributed database solutions on VINES.andO;And second, it is planning to implement intelligent data access features asVINES services.andM;RDBMS Vendors.andP;  Banyan has developed relationships with a number ofrelational database management system (RDBMS) vendors with the aim of portingtheir products to VINES.andP;  Thus far, two products have been announced, Oraclefor VINES (see Illustration 9) and VIA for VINES from VIA SystemsCorporation, a marketer of advanced distributed database servers.andM;Banyan is working with these companies and other developers to more fullyintegrate their products into VINES, particularly with StreetTalk and theVANGuard security system.andP;  There are also on-going discussions on how tooptimize the database engines and the VINES operating system for each other.andO;In addition, Banyan is counting on its support for symmetric multiprocessingto be very appealing to both database vendors and its customers' internaldevelopers.andM;Intelligent Data Access.andP;  Banyan is interested in enhancing VINES to use thenetwork more intelligently to facilitate data access of all types.andP;  One suchservice would be to offer a data distribution service that would helpdistribute information and maintain application version control.andP;  Anothersuch services--180 degrees from the data distribution--would be datacollection service, one that automatically took data from certain places onthe network and moved them to other places.andP;  Data collection could be used,for example, to automatically consolidate spreadsheets or to gather reportsto a single location.andM;Other data services include archiving and format conversion servers--thelatter handling graphics conversion or decompression.andM;The long-term goal for Banyan is to make the network sensitive to where thedata best belongs, migrating it or replicating it so that it gets closer tothe users who need it most.andM;MESSAGING.andP;  Banyan currently offers a full-featured mail system and an APIfor developers to access its engine and gateways.andP;  Banyan's goal is to makemail and its transports and interfaces the basis of more advancedapplications.andP;  Banyan is working with third parties to provide distributedoffice applications that offer the user such facilities asprocedural/workflow automation and intelligent agents.andP;  Banyan plans todifferentiate these services by orienting them towards corporate needs andprocesses, rather than aiming at the workgroup.andM;Market ThrustandM;Though Banyan sees itself as the leader in corporate-wide PC networking, thecompany is aware that, in addition to keeping its offering ahead of itscompetition, it needs to solidify its marketing thrust.andP;  A recent step inthis direction was the hiring of Jim D'Arezzo as VP for marketing.andP;  D'Arezzomost recently headed Compaq's international marketing effort, having beeninvolved with Compaq since 1983.andP;  Banyan hopes that some of Compaq'ssuccessful marketing, especially in dealing with the channels, will comealong with D'Arezzo's arrival.andM;Banyan is still focused on the large customer with a corporate-Wide PCstrategy.andP;  Banyan is working with these customers to do top-down design oftheir networks.andM;In addition, Banyan sees opportunities at the departmental level, as usersbegin to upgrade their networks from DOS-based systems (NetWare 286, 3Com 3+,etc.) to more advanced systems.andP;  Since they have to change systems anyway,Banyan hopes to convince these users to move to VINES rather than NetWare 386or LAN Manager, particularly if they want to hook their departmental LANsinto a corporate-wide network.andP;  Banyan has implemented an &quot;Upgrade-to-VINES&quot;program, where credit is given to those trading in older versions of networkoperating systems and buying VINES.andM;CHANNELS.andP;  Banyan is looking towards expanding its VAR channel.andP;  Currently,it has 140 domestic VARs, while deemphasizing the OEM market.andP;  Banyan expectsto continue with some direct sales to large customers (about 10 to 15 percentof total sales), though it hopes to turn over many of them to the local VARs.andO;Banyan has made some strong inroads in the U.S.andP;  government, recently winninga large Marine Corps contract, much of it due to VINES's Unix orientation.andM;Internationally, Banyan relies on a two-tier distribution system.andP;  Currently,it has 21 international resellers (country partners) in 35 countries.andP;  Muchof Banyan's international sales are domestic sales that are extendedglobally.andP;  And, of course, multilingual VINES is very important for theinternational market (see &quot;Multilingual VINES,&quot; above).andP;  Currently, Intelhandles much of Banyan's international hardware support.andM;POSITIONING.andP;  Banyan's key positioning task is to maintain differentiationfrom vendors above (IBM, Digital, etc.) and below (Novell, Microsoft, etc.).andO;Banyan will continue to push its architectural advantage vs.andP;  IBM and Digitalby emphasizing the cost effectiveness, flexibility, and openness of the PCplatform.andP;  For many users, a system based on a Compaq 386 or SystemPro ismore appealing than putting in a VAX or AS/400--which, while not dictated bythe Digital or IBM architectures, is the thrust of their sales forces.andM;As for Novell and Microsoft, Banyan will continue to emphasize the globalnature of its offerings.andP;  Banyan plans to maintain differentiation fromworkgroup LANs by its sales force, which is well versed in selling to largeaccounts--$100,000 to $1 million sales.andM;In addition, Banyan will seek to make adding VINES to existing networks andeventually migrating those networks to VINES (at least on the server side) anappealing alternative for departmental users.andM;Overall, Banyan considers this differentiation equal to or, in fact, moreimportant than its specific product offerings.andP;  According to David Mahoney,the make or break issues for Banyan in the first half of the '90s are:andM;* Marketing executionandM;* Focus on the distribution channelandM;* InternationalizationandM;ConclusionandM;Banyan sees a world coming where the client network software will be builtinto the client OS and be free.andP;  The battle will be for the server-sideservices and interconnectivity of these servers.andP;  Installed base of clientswill have little meaning.andM;Banyan feels that it is well-positioned for this world, claiming the majorityof the (still small) interconnectivity market for PC LANs.andP;  The company feelsthat it can make the best case as a platform for developing distributedapplications and services.andP;  And, most of all, it has the correct architecturefor the first half of the '90s.andM;However, Banyan is still facing a large challenge.andP;  By looking only at thecorporate-wide PC LANs, Banyan has essentially defined away its competition.andO;It is easy not to worry about Novell or Microsoft if neither is yourcompetitor.andP;  But users have not yet been convinced.andP;  Their perception is thatBanyan fits right in with Novell and 3Com and is historically the thirdchoice.andP;  They don't see Banyan as basically different.andP;  Most are stilllooking for Novells and 3Coms (or Microsofts) to take them into the nextgeneration.andM;Even more important is the question of whether most users will migrate tocorporate-wide PC LANs.andP;  The alternative is to keep their currentdepartmental LANs and wait for sufficient advancements in such technologiesas those that make up DCE to allow seamless integration into their corporatenetworks.andP;  And this alternative is being made more and more palatable as thePC LAN vendors enhance their products to bring them closer into line with thebroader, corporate-wide vision (we will discuss Novell's plans in nextmonth's report).andM;For Banyan, then, the challenge is twofold: first, to differentiate itselffrom the other PC LAN vendors and educate potential customers to thedifferences between a workgroup focus and a corporate-wide orientation; andsecond, to convince these potential customers that going to thecorporate-wide PC LAN is the smoothest road to reaching the distributedenvironment of the second half of the '90s.andP;  If Banyan can do both, it mayjust be in the best position to lead users down that road.andM;* Next month's Network Monitor examines the future direction Novell Inc..andM;* For reprint information on articles appearing in this issue, contact AnneWorkman at 617-742-5200.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
