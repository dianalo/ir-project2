Mercer, chairman and chief executive officer, disclosed.    Separately, the tire maker posted sharply higher profit for the second quarter, a 31% increase to $141 million, or $2.47 a share, from the year-earlier $108 million, or 99 cents a share. The 1986 figures included a $10 million gain from the sale of discontinued operations. Reflecting the company's large stock buy-back last year, per-share figures were based on 57 million shares outstanding in the latest quarter, compared with 108.9 million a year earlier.    Sales rose 8.5% to $2.56 billion from $2.36 billion.    The quarterly profit gain, exceeding analysts' expectations, reflected strengthened overseas operations, aided by effects of the weakened dollar, higher prices, and the company's restructuring moves.    Mr. Mercer said in an interview that the $6-a-share earnings forecast projected by analysts earlier this year for 1987 &quot;may be conservative.&quot; Noting Goodyear's debt-reduction efforts, he said that if those measures &quot;convert to $7 a share or $8 a share, so be it.&quot; Last year, Goodyear earned $124.1 million, or $1.16 a share, on the higher number of shares outstanding. Sales totaled $9.10 billion.    Goodyear signaled its move away from selling its energy operations as a whole by announcing yesterday that it had sold oil and gas reserves east of the Rocky Mountains and other related assets to International Paper Co.'s IP Petroleum Co. unit for about $70 million. Those reserves represent about 10 million barrels of oil.    Mr. Mercer said the company is negotiating to sell substantially all the rest of its reserves -- amounting to about 138 million barrels of oil -- for about $700 million. He declined to identify the interested buyers.    Goodyear initially planned to sell its Celeron Corp. oil and gas reserves and pipeline in a single package. But &quot;We wouldn't have reached the price we wanted,&quot; Mr. Mercer said, referring to the $2 billion the company seeks to reap from energy asset sales.    Mr. Mercer said there isn't any urgency to sell the pipeline. Indeed, he noted that its value will rise as the price of oil increases, and said, &quot;I'd love to keep it,&quot; if possible.    Mr. Mercer had championed the Celeron pipeline as Goodyear's major diversification step, but last year's unsuccessful takeover attempt by Sir James Goldsmith, an Anglo-French financier -- triggering a massive restructuring and the $2 billion stock buy-back -- forced the attempts to sell the energy holdings.    Contributing to the latest second-quarter profit was a gain of $13.6 million from various sales of assets.    Pre-tax operating profit from the company's tire and related transportation products segment rose 58% to $249 million from $158 million a year earlier. Mr. Mercer said that prices are firm for tires shipped to Detroit auto makers and that a 2% increase July 1 in prices for replacement tires &quot;seems to be sticking.&quot; He said prices on both original equipment and replacement tires are firmer than expected and are the best in years.    Second-quarter sales in the tire segment rose more than 7% to $2.19 billion from $2.04 billion a year earlier. Pre-tax foreign operating profit soared to $127 million from about $49 million, largely reflecting higher prices and plant efficiencies, as well as effects of the weaker dollar. Foreign sales increased 14% to about $1 billion from $878 million. Interest expense in the latest quarter surged to $86.5 million from $33.7 million.    For the first half, Goodyear posted net income from continuing operations of $226 million, or $3.52 a share. A $199.2 million gain from discontinued operations made net income $425.2 million, or $6.63 a share. A year earlier, Goodyear had profit from continuing operations of $34 million, or 30 cents a share, after a $110.8 million after-tax write-down of oil and gas reserves. The company had a gain from discontinued operations of $20.6 million, raising net income to $54.6 million, or 50 cents a share, on the higher number of shares outstanding.    First-half sales rose 10% to a record $4.86 billion from $4.42 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
