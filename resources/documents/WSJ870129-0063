SeibStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTEXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> TEHRAN, Iran  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Iran's powerful speaker of the parliament made clear that Iran remains interested in better relations with the U.S. -- and insisted that the U.S. does too.    Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani confidently fielded questions from reporters for nearly two hours yesterday in a performance that seemed to indicate he hasn't been politically weakened by disclosure of Iran's secret contacts with the U.S., often described here as &quot;the great Satan.&quot; The speaker, who portrayed the U.S. as a suitor for Iran's affections, played the role of coquette, alternately flirting with President Reagan and warning that Washington must do more to reaffirm its interest in better relations.    &quot;As far as President Reagan is concerned,&quot; Mr. Rafsanjani said, &quot;he has said he wants to reestablish relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we believe he is sincere in what he says because it is in his interest.&quot; But he also warned that the U.S. must demonstrate it isn't hostile to Iran by releasing weapons purchased by the shah's regime in 1979 and still held in the U.S. if it wants to end hostilities and get more help in freeing American hostages held in Lebanon. &quot;The time isn't right&quot; for more talks with the U.S. on arms, he said.    At still other times, Mr. Rafsanjani indicated Iran's need of American friendship, acknowledging at one point that Iran's weaponry is primarily U.S.-made and no other country is willing to supply Iran with sophisticated weapons. Iran's long war with Iraq has increased its need for weapons to offset Iraq's edge in military hardware.    Mr. Rafsanjani confirmed that Iranian and U.S. envoys met in December in Frankfurt, West Germany, where the Iranians were given a message from Secretary of State George Shultz that there wouldn't be any more U.S. arms sales to Iran. Secretary Shultz said in Washington earlier that he sent aide Charles Dunbar to Frankfurt Dec. 13 to make clear to the Iranians that &quot;there will be no more arms sales of whatever variety . . .&quot;    So coy is Mr. Rafsanjani that it isn't possible to know if his interest in relations with the U.S. is simply to seek an alliance of necessity or a lasting liaison. While he clearly is seeking military equipment, he seems also to be seeking international acknowledgment that Iran is the dominant power in the Persian Gulf.    Mr. Rafsanjani is emerging as a dominant power in Tehran. He appears to have skillfully used the American arms deal to strenghten his position by demonstrating that he gained important military gear from the U.S. without sacrificing much. Completely in charge and at ease, he seemed to relish his contact with Iranian and foreign reporters, lingering until virtually every reporter had asked a question.    In the kind of dramatic flourish that is his trademark, Mr. Rafsanjani produced the Bible that he said President Reagan sent to Iran, though not to him, last October. Brandishing a brown, leather-bound Bible, Mr. Rafsanjani said that, contrary to earlier reports, it wasn't delivered by Robert McFarlane, former national security adviser, during his trip to Tehran in May but rather by a much later, unidentified emissary from the president.    The speaker passed around copies of the inscription, which was dated Oct. 3, 1986, and signed Ronald Reagan. It cited St. Paul's epistle to the Galatians, Chapter 3 verse 8: &quot;And the Scriptures, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, 'All the nations shall be blessed in you.'&quot;    The speaker once again held out the possibility that sales of arms to Iran could result in the release of hostages in Lebanon, though he denied a direct connection. He noted that at the request of the U.S. and French governments, Iran has contacted groups in Lebanon holding foreign hostages, with some success. The radical Moslem kidnappers are believed to be heavily influenced by Iran and its revolutionary Islamic government.    Mr. Rafsanjani also indicated that he believes Lebanese who commit acts of terrorism -- including the seizure of German and American hostages -- may be justified. He said Lebanese Moslems have been &quot;oppressed&quot; by Western-supported Israeli forces and haven't any way of defending themselves. &quot;The people of Lebanon are subjected to such oppression that they have to aim their attacks at your airplanes, your embassies, and your officials,&quot; he said.    In a message he said he wanted to direct to Western countries, Mr. Rafsanjani said: &quot;You shouldn't arrest anybody you like at random and call him a terrorist. This can't be successful for you.&quot; This was an apparent reference to the arrest earlier this month in West Germany of a Lebanese wanted by the U.S. in the hijacking of a Trans World Airlines passenger plane in 1985 in which a U.S. Navy man was beaten to death. Several West Germans were kidnapped in Lebanon following the arrest.    Mr. Rafsanjani asserted that the U.S., France and West Germany are fostering terrorism themselves by giving haven to Iranian exile groups responsible for setting off powerful bombs here that have killed Iranian officials.    Still, Mr. Rafsanjani had a few surprisingly conciliatory comments about President Reagan, suggesting he wants to keep the door open for dealing with the Reagan administration. He said that Mr. Reagan made a &quot;couragious statement&quot; recently by declaring that the U.S. didn't have evidence that Iran was involved in recent terrorist acts.    Mr. Rafsanjani said President Reagan's rivals in the U.S. had taken advantage of his opening to Iran to damage him politically. And, he said, Mr. Reagan has reacted to the disclosure of the Iran links &quot;weakly&quot; when he should have explained to Americans the importance of Iran.    In addition, he said, Iran had been &quot;deceived&quot; by the U.S. in past dealings. He insisted that Iran didn't know Israel was involved as a middle man in the shipment of U.S. arms to Iran. &quot;We would never accept any arms from Israel,&quot; he said. But he added, &quot;If the U.S. is ready to give us spare parts we need, we are ready to accept them.&quot;    Mr. Rafsanjani didn't say whether he personally had met Mr. McFarlane. In an apparent effort to protect himself politically, Mr. Rafsanjani seemed to imply that he hasn't been involved directly and he said messages from the U.S. were directed to several top Iranian leaders.    He acknowledged receiving TOW antitank missiles but said Iran now makes its own version of those. And he said Iran has constructed an air-defense network that consists of equipment from the U.S., Britain and an East bloc nation he didn't identify. </TEXT></DOC>
