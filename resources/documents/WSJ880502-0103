Roy Romer said he asked for, and received, the resignation of the state banking commissioner after a state audit showed &quot;numerous management deficiencies&quot; in the banking division.    Richard Doby, who has been the state banking commissioner for seven years, said he agreed to resign &quot;in the best interests of the state.&quot; But Mr. Doby attributed some of the problems in his department to inadequate resources, training and equipment and said the audit didn't allege any criminal or civil wrongdoing.    The governor's office wouldn't discuss in any detail the audit's findings until the report is released Friday.    The audit follows a seven-month-long crisis among Colorado's industrial banks, which are state-chartered thrifts with deposits that are privately guaranteed. Since September, 14 of the industrial banks have collapsed. Because the guarantee fund is insolvent, about $43 million of depositors' money has been frozen while the state tries to work out a solution.    The state has about 80 industrial banks.    Mr. Doby said James Dillon, his deputy in the banking division, has been named the interim commissioner while a successor is sought. As a civil servant rather than a governor's appointee, Mr. Doby will receive four months' severance pay.    Earlier this year, the state legislature reorganized the state banking board, stripping Mr. Doby of his seat on the board and giving the remaining six members more power. Previously, the commissioner was also the board's chairman. </TEXT></DOC>
