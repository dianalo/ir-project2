(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The PTL ministry is suing Jessica Hahn toregain money in a trust account that was promised to her inexchange for her silence about a 1980 sexual encounter with formerPTL leader Jim Bakker.   The financially troubled television ministry says in a lawsuitfiled this week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Columbia that Hahnbroke her part of the bargain by talking publicly about theencounter that led to Bakker's downfall.   The suit also seeks reimbursement of any excess legal fees paidto California lawyer Scott Furstman, who managed the trust fund forPTL. Furstman has agreed to that, the suit said.   Hahn, contacted by telephone at the Playboy mansion in LosAngeles, said Thursday she doesn't want the money. But she said shewants to make sure it's used properly.   She said PTL lawyers have told her about $160,000 remains in theaccount. She said she refused the attorneys' request that she signa contract returning the money to PTL.   ``I would like to do what is right,'' Hahn said. ``But at thispoint I don't know if what they're doing is right. ... I didn'tknow if it was in my best interest to sign something like this.   ``I fell for this once and I'm not going to fall for it twice,signing something I don't know what I was signing.''   In November 1984, Hahn signed a document recanting accusationsagainst Bakker. But she said she was forced into signing it andthat a former PTL board member gave her $10,000 after she did.   The trust account was formed in February 1985 after Hahnreasserted her complaints.   PTL agreed to pay her $115,000 in cash and to establish a trustfund of $150,000. She was to receive monthly interest payments fromthe fund for 20 years, after which she would receive the principal.   In return, Hahn agreed not to speak publicly about her trystwith Bakker.   The lawsuit claims Playboy magazine paid Hahn $1 million for herstory and photographs. It concludes that ``by virtue of the termsof the settlement agreement and Hahn's decision to publicize forfinancial gain her version of the Dec. 6, 1980 incident ... thefunds in the Jessica Hahn Trust ... should be restored to PTL intheir entirety.''   Hahn disputed PTL's contention that she had broken her promise.She said evangelist Jerry Falwell, who assumed control of PTL afterBakker resigned in March 1987, cut off payments to her in April1987.</TEXT></DOC>
