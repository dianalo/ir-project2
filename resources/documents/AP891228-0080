Chinese authorities are raising defenses _ with bothsurveillance and by ideological work _ against any renewal ofpro-democracy protests inspired by Romania's example.   Work units began holding political meetings to instruct theiremployees not to let the ouster of Romania's hard-line president,Nicolae Ceausescu, shake their faith in socialism.   More plainclothes police were seen on Beijing's collegecampuses, where several anonymous, illegal posters have gone up inthe past week mocking Ceausescu and urging China to learn fromRomania.   At Beijing University, Qinghua University, Beijing NormalUniversity and other colleges whose students led massivepro-democracy protests in Beijing in the spring, Romania was themain topic of conversation, with most students expressing joy overCeausescu's ouster.   Several Chinese and Western sources said students at twocolleges planned marches to celebrate events in Romania but werefound out and stopped. The reports could not be independentlyconfirmed.   The Beijing city government reiterated Thursday that it or thecentral government must approve any gatherings or demonstrations inTiananmen Square, the focal point of the spring protests. Thecentral government recently approved a law making mostdemonstrations illegal.   The official Xinhua News Agency said Li, party General SecretaryJiang Zemin and top military and police officials met with theparty committee of the People's Armed Police, an armed forceseparate from the army that is responsible for guarding stateinstallations and putting down major disturbances.   Li paid tribute to the force for helping crush the springdemocracy movement, but added, ``China faces a long-term struggleand we cannot afford to slacken our vigilance,'' Xinhua said.   It said he told the force to ``firmly fight against any hostileforces that try to subvert the socialist system in China.''   On Wednesday, Li told a meeting of the State Council, China'sCabinet, that ``despite the changes in the international situation,China will maintain a firm belief in itself (and) adhere to thesocialist direction.''   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua reiterated the messageThursday at a weekly news briefing.   ``We are well-convinced that socialism will eventually overcomethe difficulties on its way ahead and continue to develop,'' hesaid.   ``With regard to what impact the situation in Romania and inEast Europe as a whole will have on China, I just want to say thateach country has its own circumstances.''   Although China has maintained outward neutrality on the collapseof Communism's monopoly of power in East Europe, Chinese and EastEuropean sources say Chinese leaders privately regard the changesas revisionist, or ideological backsliding.   Chinese sources said authorities have issued a document settingforth the line on Romania, stressing the need for sobriety andfaith in socialism.   Work units have begun holding special meetings on the subject.Teachers at the Beijing Normal University were called to such ameeting Wednesday.   Although students and foreign teachers said excitement overRomania was high on campuses, they noted that students are busywith end-of-term exams and will begin leaving for winter vacationin a week, reducing chances for any efforts at protests.   After initially maintaining silence on events in Romania, theofficial Chinese media has reported Ceausescu's ouster andexecution, although tersely. It has not mentioned the reasons forthe uprising or the mass arrests and killings of civilians bysecret police, but many Chinese have heard such reports on foreignradio broadcasts.   Xinhua also reported that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachevhas sent a series of letters to Chinese leaders, with a seniorSoviet envoy presenting the latest one on Thursday.   Xinhua did not say what was in the letters.   The letter was given to Zemin by Valentine Falin, director ofthe Soviet party's International Department.   Xinhua said Jiang ``expressed his thanks to Falin for the letterand to the Soviet ambassador, who had also passed on letters fromGorbachev to Jiang and Deng Xiaoping,'' China's senior leader.   Falin, who arrived Saturday, is the highest-ranking Sovietofficial to visit Beijing since May, when Gorbachev came tonormalize state relations and restore party ties broken in the1960s over ideological differences.</TEXT></DOC>
