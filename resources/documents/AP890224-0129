Troops clamped a curfew on Nablus' 120,000 residents and launchedhouse-to-house searches, Arab reports said. Residents heard sporadicgunfire in the area, the reports said.   Military sources said the cement block was dropped during a clashin Nablus' open air market.   Also today, nine Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes inthe Gaza Strip, and a senior PLO official was quoted as saying he istrying to arrange a meeting with Israeli Defense Minister YitzhakRabin in London.   Arab hospital officials said the Gaza Strip casualties included a30-year-old woman from the Rafah refugee camp who is nine monthspregnant. Doctors said she was shot in the back but was not inserious condition. They said a 4-year-old boy was wounded in theright arm in the Maghazi refugee camp.   An army spokeswoman said she was checking the reports.   At least 385 Palestinians and 17 Israelis, including the soldierkilled today, have died in the 14-month Arab revolt against Israelioccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Bassem Abu Sharif, PLO chief Yasser Arafat's political adviser,was quoted as saying he hopes to meet Rabin in London.   Rabin has left for a fund-raising tour in Switzerland and wasscheduled to go to London before returning to Israel next week, saida Defense Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Hedeclined to elaborate.   ``I'm working through British political figures in theConservative Party to arrange a meeting with Rabin who will visitLondon,'' Abu Sharif said in an interview in London with thenewspaper Yediot Ahronot.   ``If I meet him I will ask him `why do you shoot children?''' AbuSharif said. ``He will of course ask me `why are you rioting?' ''   Rabin has met extensively with Palestinian officials in theoccupied lands. However, he has said he would not negotiate with thePLO, which Israel considers a terrorist organization.   Abu Sharif said Israeli public opinion is important to the PLOand could significantly influence the peace process.   However, he said, mistrust is widespread on both sides.   ``In the meantime, a majority of the Israelis don't believe thePalestinians, but I must say that the situation is similar in thePalestinian public with regard to the Israelis,'' he was quoted assaying.   Recent polls have indicated that the majority of Israelis supportnegotiations with the PLO under certain conditions.   In other developments, the army has appointed a brigadier generalto investigate mysterious explosions that have killed threePalestinian children and wounded at least 11 others in the northernWest Bank.   Military officials have said the area, northeast of the city ofNablus, is an air force training zone and that the explosives mighthave been flares dropped during maneuvers.   The most recent incident occurred Thursday when 19-year-oldshepherd was burned in the hands and face after handling anunidentified object. The Jerusalem Post newspaper said Kassemdescribed the object as rectangular and shiny, similar to the flaresused by the air force.</TEXT></DOC>
