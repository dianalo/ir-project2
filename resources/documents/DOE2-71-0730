The correct cytologicor histologic diagnosis was established in 91% of these small lesions.The accuracy was 79% for masses {le}1 cm, 88% for masses 1-2 cm, and98% for masses 2-3 cm in size. Successful US-guided biopsy of small massesis possible because of continuous real-time monitoring of needle position,primarily using phased-array transducers; the use of larger bore (18-to 19-gauge) needles to improve cytologic and histologic yield; and thefrequent use of an echogenic screw-biopsy stylet, which markedly improvesneedle visibility.</TEXT></DOC>
