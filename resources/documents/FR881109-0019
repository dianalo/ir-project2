Background</ITAG>Under Section 644 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, Pub. L.95-91 (42 U.S.C. 7254), the Secretary of Energy is authorized to prescribesuch procedural rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary or appropriateto accomplish the functions vested in that position. Accordingly, the DEARwas promulgated with an effective date of April 1, 1984 (49 FR 11922, March28, 1984), 48 CFR Chapter 9.The purpose of this rule is to revise the DEAR, as necessary, to implementthe requirements of the Prompt Payment Act as implemented by Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) Circular A-125, Prompt Payment, and FAR Subpart32.9, Prompt Payment.A brief description of DEAR amendments follows:DEAR Section 932.111, Contract Clauses, is deleted in its entirety.DEAR Subpart 932.71, Contract Payments, is deleted in its entirety.DEAR Subpart 932.9, Prompt Payment, is added as a new Subpart in orderto establish certain DOE specific policies and procedures required to implementthe prompt payment provisions specified in FAR Subpart 32.9.Under Part 952, Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses, Section 952.232,including Subsections 952.232-1 through 952.232-8, 952.232-10, and 952.232-70through 952.232-73, is deleted in its entirety.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedural Requirements</ITAG>A. Review Under Executive Order 12291In accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193,February 27, 1981), this rulemaking has been reviewed by DOE. DOE has concludedthat the rule is not a ``major rule'' because its promulgation will notresult in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States based enterprisesto compete in domestic or export markets.B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility ActThis rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub.L. 96-354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysisfor any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This rule will have no impact on interest rates,tax policies or liabilities, the costs of goods or services or other directeconomic factors. It will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysishas been prepared.C. Review Under Paperwork Reduction ActNo new information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposedby this proposed rule. Accordingly, no OMB clearance is required by section350(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.).D. Review Under the National Environmental Policy ActDOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent amajor Federal action having significant impact on the human environmentunder the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 432<T3>et seq., </T3>1976), or the Council on Environmental Quality regulations(40 CFR Part 1020), and therefore does not require an environmental impactstatement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA. E. Public HearingThe Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve asubstantial issue of fact or law and that the proposed rule should nothave a substantial impact on the nation's economy or large numbers of individualsor businesses. Therefore, pursuant to Pub. L. 95-91, the DOE OrganizationAct, the Department does not plan to hold a public hearing on this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.

For purposes of determining paymentdue dates on a final invoice pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of the basicPrompt Payment clause and (a)(2)(i)(B) of its Alternate I at FAR 52.232-25,contract settlement occurs when the contracting officer determines thatthe contractor has complied with all contract terms and conditions, includingall administrative requirements (e.g., execution and delivery of contractor'srelease of claims, execution of understandings setting forth final indirectcosts rates, establishment of final contract price). In addition, for purposesof determining any interest penalties under cost-type contracts, the effectivedate of contract settlement shall be the effective date of the final contractmodification issued to acknowledge contract settlement and to closeoutthe contract. (2) <T3>Constructive acceptance periods</T3>. It is expected that, in the majorityof cases, Government acceptance or approval can occur within the standardconstructive acceptance or approval periods specified in paragraphs (a)(6)(i)of the basic Prompt Payment clause and (a)(5)(i) of its Alternate I atFAR 52.232-25. However, the contracting officer should coordinate theseprovisions with the DOE official(s) that will be responsible for performingthe acceptance and/or approval function(s). Where the contracting officerdetermines, in writing, on a case-by-case basis, that it is not reasonableor feasible for DOE to perform the acceptance or approval function withinthe standard period, the contracting officer should specify a longer constructiveacceptance or approval period, as appropriate. Considerations include,but are not limited to, the nature of supplies or services involved, geographicalsite location, inspection and testing requirements, shipping and acceptanceterms, and available DOE resources.(b) <T3>Contract financing payments</T3>. (1) The standard payment due dateto be specified by the contracing officer in paragraphs (b)(2) of the basicPrompt Payment clause and its Alternate I at FAR 52.232-25 shall normallybe 30 days for progress payments and 30 days for interim payments on cost-typecontracts.(2) Contracting officers may specify payment due dates that are less thanthe standard when a determination is made, in writing, on a case-by-casebasis, that a shorter contract financing payment cycle will be requiredto finance contract work. In such cases, the contracting officer shouldcoordinate with the finance and program officials that will be involvedin the payment process to ensure that the contract payment terms to bespecified in solicitations and resulting contract awards can be reasonablymet. Consideration should be given to geographical separation, workload,contractor ability to submit a proper request, and other factors that couldaffect timing of payment. However, payment due dates that are less than7 days for progress payments or less than 14 days for interim paymentson cost-type contracts are not authorized.<ITAG tagnum="52">Part 952_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 952.232_[Removed]</ITAG>5.
