The foreign ministers of the 12 nations of the European EconomicCommunity will meet Monday to discuss the conflict, which wassparked Jan. 1 when the trading bloc imposed a prohibition on U.S.meat from cattle treated with growth hormones.   The ban affected about $100 million in sales of U.S. beef andveal.   Washington countered with 100 percent duties on a range ofEuropean food imports, also affecting about $100 million in trade.   Nico Wegter, a community spokesman, said the foreign ministerswill be asked to put into effect as soon as possible countermeasuresthat would slap stiff duties on American imports of dried fruit andwalnuts.   However, other officials said that a number of countries appearto want to defer setting a date to give the two sides more time toresolve the dispute, particularly with George Bush being sworn in asthe new U.S. president today.   The officials, who demanded anonymity, said the ministers mayalso want to await the outcome of a Feb. 8 meeting of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade. The EEC intends to ask the 96-nationGATT to declare the U.S. retaliatory measures in violation of theinternational body's rules.   The Geneva-based GATT attempts to remove trade barriers andensure the free movement of goods worldwide.   Many U.S. farmers treat their animals with growth hormones, apractice U.S. officials said is safe. The EEC said it believed suchmeat poses a health risk.   In Strausbourg, France, the European Parliament today backed themeat ban and urged the United States to suspend its retaliatorymeasures until the dispute is settled through GATT. The next GATTmeeting is set for Feb. 8.   On Thursday, EEC External Relations Commissioner Frans Andriessensaid he was considering submitting the ban to an internationalscientific panel.</TEXT></DOC>
