The move, eagerly awaited by the French financialcommunity, eliminates a problematic rule that allowed ashareholder or group of allied shareholders to bid for onlytwo-thirds of a target company after acquiring more thanone-third of its capital or voting rights.</LP><TEXT>   The three-year-old rule, originally intended to keeptakeover costs down for businesses and leave companies quotedon the market after takeovers, has led to thorny legaltangles and bitter squabbles between shareholders in thecontroversial takeovers of Au Printemps S.A., Exor S.A. andSource Perrier S.A.   The rule has been most heavily criticized for unfairtreatment of minority shareholders. The main problem, criticshave said, is that once the two-thirds bid is over, thetarget's share price generally collapses, leaving theminority shareholders with devalued shares of a company inwhich they may no longer want a stake.   The Conseil des Bourses de Valeur, which supervises theParis Bourse and must approve all takeover bids, said itsproposals will be formalized and transmitted next month toFinance Minister Pierre Beregovoy for approval.</TEXT></DOC>
