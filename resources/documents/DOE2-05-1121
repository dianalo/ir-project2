We may,in particular, wonder whether it is still economically feasible and strategicallyhelpful to keep carrying out wide investment programs, already definedat an international level, which aim at replacing oil sources with coalin energy production. This article provides a positive answer to thisquestion. In fact, it argues that the economy of investing in energyconversion systems does not depend on relative fuel prices. It shouldinstead be based on a long run evaluation according to the thermo-electricplants' life-cycles. In this perspective, there is a general agreementon a long term investment policy framework, in which coal exploitation,as compared to oil, maintains an adequate competitive edge. Moreover,coal provides a better answer to strategic energy policy problems suchas economic and political vulnerability, trade balance equilibrium, etc.This article examines these problems and shows the importance of a coaldevelopment strategy in the case of highly oil dependent countries.</TEXT></DOC>
