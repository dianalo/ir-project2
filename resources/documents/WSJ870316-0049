RoseStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BUD WNEWSFOOD andamp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB) </IN><TEXT>   Anheuser-Busch Cos. said it is conducting an internal investigation into &quot;allegations of improper conduct by certain employees and suppliers.&quot;    It also confirmed that three sales executives have left the company, though the St. Louis-based beer maker didn't connect the two events.    The statements came in response to questions about a report in Friday's St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the investigation involves payments to Anheuser-Busch executives by a now-defunct advertising and promotional agency. Closely held Hanley Worldwide Inc., which did business as Hanley Partnership, has been in Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings under the federal Bankruptcy Code since early 1984.    Anheuser-Busch wouldn't go much beyond its one-sentence statement, saying through its public relations firm that it expects to complete the investigation by the end of this week.    The company also declined to give any details about the executives, beyond confirming they are Joseph E. Martino, Michael A. Orloff and John C. Lodge. The three were understood to have left the company Tuesday and Wednesday of last week. None could be reached for comment.    The company also declined to give any details about the executives, beyond confirming they are Joseph E. Martino, Michael A. Orloff and John C. Lodge. The three left the company Tuesday and Wednesday of last week.    According to the company's newly issued annual report, Mr. Martino was the vice president, sales, for the Anheuser-Busch beer unit, and Mr. Orloff was the vice president of its wholesale operations division. Mr. Lodge wasn't listed in the report, but his attorney confirmed he was manager of national sales promotion events.    Thomas M. Walsh, an attorney for Messrs. Martino and Orloff, confirmed Sunday that his clients left the company early last week, but he declined further comment.    Though the details surrounding the departure of the executives weren't clear, the court-appointed trustee for Hanley alleged in a suit he filed last year against Mr. Lodge that the agency helped pay for a Porsche for the executive.    The trustee, Gerald A. Rimmel, said in a telephone interview Friday that the Hanley agency issued a check for $13,500 toward the purchase of the car in 1982. He said that around that time, Hanley &quot;was doing a lot of advertising and promotional work for Anheuser-Busch.&quot;    Mr. Lodge's attorney, Marc Kramer, said Friday that if the agency paid for part of the cost of the car, his client wasn't aware of it. &quot;He felt he paid full price,&quot; Mr. Kramer said.    Mr. Kramer said he didn't know why his client was fired last week, a year after those allegations were made. &quot;Mr. Lodge is really a victim of circumstance right now,&quot; he said, adding that he believes his client can win the suit filed against him by the bankruptcy trustee.    According to the Post-Dispatch, a former Hanley executive testified in bankruptcy court last year that he had heard &quot;hearsay&quot; allegations that Mr. Martino received $250,000 and that Mr. Orloff received $25,000. The account didn't make clear the source of any such payments.    Calling the statements &quot;hearsay about hearsay,&quot; Mr. Rimmel said Friday that he hadn't found any evidence to date that such payments, if any, came from the Hanley agency.    Mr. Walsh, the attorney for the two men, said he had &quot;no comment at this time on any allegations against Mr. Martino or Mr. Orloff.&quot;    Earlier this year, a former director of advertising at Brown Group Inc. agreed to pay Hanley $5,215 to settle the trustee's allegations that the agency bought her a Toyota Supra. Brown, a St. Louis-based footwear and specialty retail concern that has filed suit against the former employee, declined to comment.    The former employee, Patricia Harbour, referred questions to her lawyer, Kathryn Koch, who said she couldn't comment on the merits of the matter.    Mr. Rimmel said Hanley had offices in St. Louis and New York, and had plans to open offices around the country before its bank cut off its credit line in late 1983. </TEXT></DOC>
