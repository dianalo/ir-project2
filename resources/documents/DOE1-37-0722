By theignition of an underwater bridgewire explosion an interaction was triggeredat that jet, which was nearest to the explosion centre. Under suitableconditions this interaction leaped over to neighbouring jets and reachedeven the most distant jet, when not stopped before. The propagation couldbe recorded by a high speed camera. The records showed, that the interactionspropagated in special directions and the velocity of the propagationwas in a range of 2 to 8 m/s. The position of the drops and their distanceto each other is very important for the propagation. By separating thesingle melt jets with fixed copper plats, it could be showed, that hydrodynamiceffects are not responsible for the propagation of the interactions.Shock waves, resulting from the interaction cycles, are the cause forthe propagation of the interactions.</TEXT></DOC>
