Prices had been stronger most of the day, on optimism thatthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would agreeon production cuts. A number of statements from OPECministers and their representatives bolstered that sentiment.</LP><TEXT>   But in midafternoon, the Dow Jones International PetroleumReport moved a headline stating that yesterday's officialsession of OPEC's policy-setting committee would bepostponed. The headline, viewed on a big screen on the floorof the New York Mercantile Exchange and flashed acrossnumerous computer screens at trading houses, quickly took thesteam out of the market.   Traders interpreted it to mean that the oil ministers werestill far apart and couldn't reach a consensus on output cutsin their informal discussions.   &quot;There were rumors out that OPEC was going to do some kindof a production cut,&quot; said Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp.&quot;Then it hit the wires that the meeting was going to besuspended for the rest of the day, and the market sold offfast.&quot;   On the Merc, West Texas Intermediate for June deliveryended at $18.68 a barrel, down 13 cents. Earlier it hadcrossed $19 a barrel -- a bullish barrier -- and climbed ashigh as $19.10. Many speculators were betting on furtherprice rises, but when news of the postponed meeting becamewidespread, they quickly unloaded those &quot;long&quot; positions.   Petroleum-product prices moved in lockstep with crude,though they didn't come off as much. Gasoline for Junedelivery wound up at 60.95 cents a gallon, down 0.08 cents.June heating oil fell 1.11 cents, to 51.86 cents a gallon.   The OPEC meeting is critical to oil markets, because thecartel's production has been running as much as two millionbarrels a day above its production ceiling, helping to createa world-wide glut of crude. The challenge is for the group todetermine how much to cut and how to apportion the reductionsamong the 13 members.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn futures prices are likely tocontinue to climb this morning, following a flurry of buyorders executed shortly before the close of trading yesterdayon the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn futures for July deliverygained 4.25 cents to close at $2.89 a bushel. That late rallywas spurred by rumors that the Soviet Union will be back inthe market soon for U.S. corn, said Steven Freed, a futuresanalyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. CertainAsian countries may also be buying corn soon, according toother Board of Trade rumors. Analysts said that one sign theSoviets may be about to buy corn was a round of futuresbuying by Refco Group Ltd. late yesterday. The Soviets arerumored to have used Refco in the past to buy futurescontracts a week or so ahead of major grain purchases, as away to hedge their exposure to fluctuating grain prices.Refco and other commercial grain trading firms don't commenton their trading activities, nor do the Soviets. Soybeanfutures prices closed higher as well, after it became clearto traders that Tuesday's price slide in the final minutes oftrading wasn't going to continue into yesterday's tradingsession, analysts said. Once soybean futures pricesstabilized in early trading, traders covered their &quot;short&quot;positions by buying contracts to offset those they soldTuesday in anticipation of further price declines. Julysoybean futures gained 8.25 cents to close at $6.5175 abushel. July wheat futures rose 5.75 cents to close at$3.4750 a bushel.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices eased, but soonest-to-expirepositions continued firmer than more distant months. The Maydelivery was off 0.80 cent a pound to $1.2130. However, Julydeclined by 1.15 cents to $1.1215, widening the premium ofMay over July by 0.35 cent a pound to 9.15 cents. Among moredistant months, December 1990, which has the most significantamount of trading, lost 1.50 cents on the day. Much like thesoftness that took place after the strong expiration of theApril contracts last Thursday in New York, prices in Londonyesterday softened, and the premium of the cash position onthe London Metal Exchange over the three-months' positionnarrowed. On Tuesday, the premium had widened sharply afterbuyers of expiring call options exercised their right to buyfutures contracts and sellers of the contracts had to buyfutures to fulfill their commitments. In Peru, the governmentordered miners and smelter workers of the Southern PeruCopper Corp. to return to work by today or lose their jobs.Late in the day, Reuter reported that, according to JorgeQuesada, secretary general of the Peruvian National MineWorkers' Federation, the workers would ignore thegovernment's decree and continue the strike that began March12. However, a company spokesman said that the federationdidn't speak for the five unions involved in the strike.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Most futures prices eased slightly. The Julycontract was off 0.48 cent to 92.34 cents. Statisticsindicate that since last July, when quota and price segmentsof the International Coffee Agreement were suspended,producing countries have been on a selling binge. For ninemonths through March, exports of member producing countrieshave totaled 61.3 million bags, compared with 48.8 millionbags during the same period a year earlier. A bag weighs 132pounds. According to one New York coffee dealer, these saleshave caused supplies in importing countries to swell tosubstantial proportions. But, he noted, shipments from Aprilthrough September will be much slower and will cause some ofthese reserves to be used up. As a result, prices are likelyto remain stable until Central American coffee begins to cometo the market in September, he said. &quot;A critical factor willbe if the shipments begin on time,&quot; he said. If they don't,prices could rise. At the moment, there is little interest inreviving the International Coffee Agreement, the dealernoted. Most Central American countries are getting areasonable price for their coffee, and with the abolition ofthe Brazilian Coffee Institute no one knows who would decidewhether Brazil would participate in a new pact, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
