Additionally theyhave been regulated by special government agencies concerned with radiologicalprotection. Radioactive contaminants are also distinguished by the specializedand very sensitive methods available for the detection of radioactivity.Measurements of a few thousand atoms per liter are not uncommon. Radiationdetectors in common use are gas filled chambers, scintillation and semiconductordetectors, and the more recently developed thermoluminescent and etchedtrack detectors. Solid-state nuclear track detectors consist of a largegroup of inorganic and organic dielectrics which register tracks whentraversed by heavy charged particles. They do not respond to light, betaparticles or gamma ray photons and thus provide a very low backgroundsystem for the detection of extremely low levels of radioactivity. Inaddition, no power source or electronic equipment is required. Cellulosenitrate detectors are currently in use for long term integrated samplingof environmental radon. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TID's) are crystallinematerials, in which electrons which have been displaced by an interactionwith ionizing radiation become trapped at an elevated energy level andemit visible light when released from that energy level. As which etched-trackdetectors no power or electronic equipment is needed for the TID's ata measurement site, but they respond to alpha, beta and gamma radiation.Thermoluminescent dosimeters are useful for long term environmental monitoring,and have also been newly incorporated into integrating radon detectionsystems.</TEXT></DOC>
