 Wehave received reports that the installer program for Letraset's LetraStudiodisplay type software has been causing problems on Mac IIxes.andP;  One person onCompuServe's MAUG said that the installer trashed his IIx's hard disk,although other reports just claimed that the program would not installproperly.andM;The person we spoke to from Letraset's technical support department told usthat they have also gotten calls about the problem.andP;  They have so far beenunable to replicate the problem on a Mac IIx in-house, but they have adevelopmental IIx model and they are trying to determine if Apple madechanges to the ROMs with the final machine.andM;We have played with LetraStudio a bit and have found it a good product forworking with special display type like that found in ads and headlines.andP;  Itcannot use any of Adobe's PostScript fonts due to Adobe's font encryptionscheme, but Letraset has a growing font library of its own.andP;  Companies likeBitstream are rapidly moving into the PostScript font market, which shouldalleviate that sticky problem in the future.andM;We can live with the font limitation, given the specialized nature of theprogram, but there is one big drawback with LetraStudio that, quite frankly,surprises us: the fonts are copy protected.andP;  The Installer lets you place theprogram on a hard disk so that you can use it without having to insert a keydisk, but it only allows four installations, though you can de-install it(see related story, Page 18).andM;What is strange about the copy protection is Letraset's history ofunencumbered applications.andP;  ReadySetGo!, originally published by ManhattanGraphics before Letraset purchased it in 1987, was a trend-setting programwhen it debuted in 1985 without copy protection, and Letraset has followedthis line with its other programs.andP;  It is distressing that a company with anenlightened past has returned to the Dark Ages by penalizing loyal users withthis archaic practice.andP;  We are sure that some accountants somewhere have whatthey think is a valid reason for saddling a good program with a bad idea, butit may take poor sales to convince them otherwise.andM;Virus fever.andP;  Jeff Shulman is working on a new version of his shareware deskaccessory, VirusDetective.andP;  Version 2 will be easier to use and will providemore configuration options.andP;  The current 1.2 release, however, can bemodified easily to check for recent viruses and mutations.andM;Using VirusDetective's Modifications button (hidden a few levels down throughHelp buttons), we added checks for the INIT29 virus and the Hpat variant ofthe nVIR virus.andP;  (See &quot;New, mutant viral strains ring in the new year,&quot;MacWEEK, Jan. 3.)andM;The additional VirusDetective search strings listed below may identify other,non-viral resources, too, so stay away from VirusDetective's Remove function.andO;If a file displays multiple symptoms of a virus, we recommend repairing it byreplacing it with a fresh copy from a safe, locked master disk.andM;The Hpat search strings for VirusDetective 1.2 are: Hpat Any INIT Size 416CODE Size 422andM;Search strings fro the INIT29 virus are: INIT ID 29 INIT Size 712 CODE Size712andM;Search words must be typed exactly as shown.andM;Mega-virus.andP;  The first version of Mega-ROM, a CD-ROM collection ofpublic-domain files from QLTech of Coral Gables, Fla., and Nimbus Records ofCharlottesville, Va., was infected with a virus.andP;  This disk can be identifiedby its green stripes and the legend &quot;Volume 1, October 1988.&quot;andP;  Any copiesshould be destroyed.andP;  QLTech is replacing the infected disks with free copiesof a clean CD-ROM labeled with blue stripes and a later date.andM;Jumping SEs.andP;  Apple has finally changed the SE's logic board to eliminate thetouchy step of removing or soldering resistors to accommodate differentmemory configurations.andM;According to an on-line discussion on MacNET, the memory jumper must beremoved entirely for both 2.5- and 4-Mbyte configurations.andP;  The standard1-Mbyte configuration requires the jumper to be in the position labeled&quot;1MB&quot;.andP;  The 2-Mbyte configuration requires the jumper in the &quot;2/4MB&quot;location.andP;  Once the jumper is set correctly, the SIMMs must be placedaccording to new rules: One-Mbyte SIMMs go in sockets 3 and 4 first; sockets1 and 2 are optionally filled with either 1-Mbyte or 256-Mbyte SIMMs.andM;QMS ColorScript speed-up.andP;  We have seen a few references to the large amountof time it can take to print PixelPaint documents on the QMS ColorScriptcolor printer.andP;  Eric Benson of Charette's Computer Graphics Studio ofCambridge, Mass., told us that if you import the PixelPaint files intoQuarkXPress 2.0, they print much quicker.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
