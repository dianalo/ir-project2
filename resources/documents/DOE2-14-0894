<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-14-0894 </DOCNO><TEXT>The description of lepton-nucleus and hadron-nucleus interactions in theframework of cluster quark model (CQM) is considered. Analysis of experimentaldata, obtained for deep inelastic scattering of electrons on /sup 3/Henucleus is carried out and critical radius of R/sub c/ for 3, 6, 9-quarkclusters is determined. Predictions of CQM in the region of the Bjorkenvariable xandgt;1 for nuclear structure functions are tested. The Drell-Yan(DY) processes for proton-nucleus, pion-nucleus interactions in the frameworkof CQM are discussed and the data obtained for differential cross sectionspN-, PID-, PIFe-interactions and their ratios for various nuclei arecompared with predictions of other models. It is pointed out that thedescription of sea quark and antiquark distributions in nuclear processesin DY model is as reliable as in CQM. 31 refs.; 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
