National Amusements, which owns about 20% of Viacom, has said it opposes the buyout and may make a competing offer.    The purchase also adds a fourth major shareholder to Orion, which itself has occasionally been the subject of takeover speculation. Metromedia Inc. last year acquired a 9.3% stake, Time Inc. has a 3% stake, and Orion's management controls about 8.2%. William Bernstein, executive vice president at Orion, dismissed speculation that there may be a fight for control of the company, saying that &quot;these are not strangers to us -- we've known all these people a long time.&quot; John Kluge, Metromedia's chairman, and three Viacom executives serve on Orion's board.    Sumner Redstone, chairman and president of National Amusements, declined to comment on his plans for Viacom, but said in a telephone interview that he made the Orion investment because &quot;I like the company.&quot; He added that &quot;while their financial results have not been tremendous, they have a strong lineup of motion pictures, and 'Platoon' is beyond belief.&quot; He said he had contacted Orion's founder and chairman, Arthur Krim, to assure him the investment was friendly.    Mr. Krim said in a statement that he is &quot;pleased with the news&quot; of National Amusements' stake because Mr. Redstone told him &quot;he was making the investment because he had confidence in the future of the company.&quot;    John Tinker, an analyst at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., called Mr. Redstone's move &quot;intriguing.&quot; He said, &quot;The feeling seems to be that there may be a deal between Redstone and Viacom, and the question is, what can Viacom give him that he wants? He may want Orion.&quot;    Viacom, a cable and entertainment concern, declined to comment. The proposed Viacom buyout is valued at about $3 billion. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company or through asset sales.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Viacom closed at $41 a share, up 25 cents.    Orion closed at $14.50 a share, down 25 cents, also in Big Board trading. National Amusements said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it holds 1.1 million Orion common shares, including 463,000 purchased from Jan. 2 through last Monday for $13 to $14.50 each.    While Orion has produced several hits and critically acclaimed films such as &quot;Amadeus&quot; and movies by Woody Allen, it has been financially troubled. In the year ended last Feb. 28, the company had a loss of about $31 million. In the third quarter ended Nov. 30, Orion had a loss of $3.6 million, which included a $2.3 million charge related to bankruptcy-law filings by some television-station customers that buy its programs and series.    During 1986, Orion had the No. 4 box office hit, &quot;Back to School,&quot; which brought in about $90 million at the box office. Its Christmas movie, &quot;The Three Amigos,&quot; brought in about $29 million through the holiday season, and while the movie is still in theaters, analysts say the results are disappointing so far. It is too early to tell how successful &quot;Platoon&quot; will be; while the movie has won critical praise and is the subject of a Time magazine cover story this week, Orion hasn't yet released it nationally. </TEXT></DOC>
