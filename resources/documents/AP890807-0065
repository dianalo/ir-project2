Soviet chief envoy Yuri Nazarkin said the seven-week sessionmade progress on some technical points. However, he added,``Whatever progress has been made does not involve, to my regret,solutions to major outstanding issues.''   Responding to a Bush administration proposal, Nazarkin saidtesting anti-cheating measures before a treaty is complete ``couldbe helpful.'' He said Moscow is reviewing the proposal.   The 4{-year-old negotiations, which include space-based missiledefenses, will resume Sept. 25 after a Sept. 19-20 meeting betweenSecretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard Shevardnadze in the United States. They are expected todiscuss arms control.   Both sides have acknowledged that full agreement on a strategicarms reduction treaty is not in sight.   A major dispute from the beginning has centered on U.S. plansfor space-based missile defenses, known as the Strategic DefenseInitiative or Star Wars. Moscow links a treaty to what Washingtonconsiders crippling restrictions on such a system.   Disagreement also persists on long-range nuclear crise missilesbased at sea. Moscow wants to include them under the treaty'slimits. Washington refuses, saying their presence cannot bemonitored reliably. Progress was reported on monitoring provisionsfor mobile missiles, but the sides still disagree on whether theyshould be allowed at all. The United States wants to ban theweapons, which it does not have. The Soviets, who have suchmissiles, reject a ban.   However, many details of an agreement have already been workedout, including mutual limits of 6,000 nuclear warheads.   The draft treaty covers nuclear forces with ranges above 3,400miles, including intercontinental missiles and heavy bombers.</TEXT></DOC>
