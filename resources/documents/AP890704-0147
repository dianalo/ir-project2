Maj. Gen. Alexander Griyenko spoke at a news conference at whichreporters were shown photographs of charred bodies, destroyed andburned houses and smashed cars _ ``all done by extremists'' in thatCentral Asian republic, the Soviet news agency Tass said.   Griyenko said three soldiers ``sustained gunshot wounds and 161were injured.'' He added that in all, 511 Interior Ministryservicemen were wounded in unrest that hit various parts of thenation since February.   The general said nearly 10,000 people were arrested in the unrestin the predominantly Moslem Uzbekistan republic _ 9,092 for curfewviolations and 700 for breaking the peace. About 10,000 guns wereconfiscated, he said.   Griyenko reported that 754 houses, 28 state facilities and 275cars were burned or looted.   He said Interior Ministry troops fired only at ``specificextremists'' as they were trying to attack the soldiers and that``the use of arms in all cases was absolutely justified, as shown byan investigation conducted by the prosecutor's office,'' Tass added.   The general is a member of the military council of the ministry's300,000-strong forces.   Earlier reports put the number of Fergana dead at about 100. Therioting, arson and murders began in early May and continued intoJune, pitting ethnic Uzbeks against the Meskhi Turk minority, whichwas forcibly resettled to the region from the southern Georgiarepublic by dictator Josef Stalin in 1944.   Authorities pledged last month to create 200,000 jobs, clean uppolluting factories and grow more food in the region to stem theeconomic and environmental problems blamed for much of the unrest.   According to Griyenko, weapons were not used against peopleduring other mass ethnic disturbances in Nagorno-Karabakh, Sumgait,Georgia and Kazakhstan.   Griyenko said ministry troops are assigned to curb violations ofpublic order if they are large-scale, pose a threat to life,disorganize the work of enterprises and are directed at destroyingstate, public or personal property.   The law allows these troops to use arms only as an extrememeasure.   Regarding riot-control gear, Griyenko said the soldiers'equipment included bullet-proof vests, plastic and metal shields,rubber truncheons, all types of short-barrel firearms, water cannonand tear gas.   Last year, Interior Ministry forces used tear gas more than 1,000times, but there were no fatalities or cases of a long-term effecton health, he said.   On April 9, 20 people were killed when Soviet troops attackedrioters in Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgians said the troops used a potentform of tear gas.</TEXT></DOC>
