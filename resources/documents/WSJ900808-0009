Diplomatic sources say the decision to send jet fighters,bombers and troops to Saudi Arabia and Turkey was made afterAmerican intelligence detected ominous new Iraqi militarymoves on the Saudi borders. These included the secretdeployment of dozens of Iraqi fighter aircraft to Yemen, onthe opposite side of Saudi Arabia, and Iraqi troop movementsin occupied Kuwait. To make the U.S. intervention morepalatable in the Moslem world, Egypt is believed to haveagreed to join the military effort and other nations may alsolend support.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. action risks putting American forces into apotentially widespread conflict and brings President Bush tothe most dangerous and decisive hour of his young presidency.But he enters this confrontation armed with unusually strongdomestic support and an unprecedented international consensusthat Iraq's march through the Persian Gulf must be halted.   In the hours before the deployment, a global embargoground Iraqi oil exports nearly to a halt. Turkey beganturning away ships seeking to load oil from Iraq's twinpipeline through that country and said it would shut down theline within a few days. In Moscow, a top Foreign Ministryaide told The Wall Street Journal that the Soviet Union mightjoin a possible naval blockade of Iraqi oil exports.   In a major policy turnabout, King Fahd of Saudi Arabiayesterday agreed to increase the kingdom's oil output to helpmake up for world oil supplies lost to the embargo, senioradministration officials said. It was understood the Saudishadn't yet pledged to a specific figure, although theadministration has been seeking a commitment of increasingproduction by about two million barrels a day. Alsoyesterday, Venezuelan officials told Vice President DanQuayle that their country would pump oil beyond its OPECquota, according to an official traveling with the vicepresident.   But the most significant breakthrough was Saudi Arabia'sagreement to harbor a large foreign military contingentinside its kingdom. The Saudi royal family for more than adecade has repeatedly rebuffed American pleas for access toits large, modern air bases, for fear of inciting ananti-American backlash both inside the kingdom and among itsMoslem neighbors.   But military intelligence supplied by the U.S. and thethreat posed by Iraq's forces along the Saudi border appearto have swayed the royal family, as did the apparentagreement of Egypt, a leader of the Islamic world, toparticipate. Though the Egyptian Defense Ministry was sayinglast night it hadn't sent any troops yet, Pentagon officialssaid Defense Secretary Richard Cheney had obtained promisesthat Egyptian troops would be dispatched in the next fewdays. Mr. Bush scheduled a press conference for 9 a.m. EDTtoday to discuss the situation in the Persian Gulf.   Before the American deployment was disclosed, the WhiteHouse was already sounding warnings about Iraq's intentionsin the region. &quot;We believe there is an imminent threat toSaudi Arabia from the way that they {the Iraqi forces} arepositioned and located in Kuwait,&quot; presidential spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said yesterday afternoon.   The deployment, which was confirmed by Pentagon officials,apparently has been in the works since Iraq's lightningtakeover of Kuwait last Thursday. But the administrationwasn't planning to announce the venture until today.Officials expressed concern that leaks about the mission hadnot only tipped off the Iraqis but might have rattled thenervous Saudis.   The most immediate risk facing Mr. Bush involves thevulnerability of an estimated 3,000 American civilians stillin Kuwait and 500 in Iraq itself -- including 39 Americansbottled up in a Baghdad hotel. The State Department saidyesterday the 39 have been prevented from leaving thebuilding, although the U.S. officially doesn't yet considerthem hostages. As a precaution, Mr. Bush has senthostage-rescue commandos to the mideast, where they are onstand-by.   According to government sources, the U.S. deployment planinvolves sending as many as 40,000 troops in phases,including elements of the 82nd Airborne division and part ofa Marine division, to Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in theregion. At least 80 U.S. fighters, including F-15s and F-16s,would also be dispatched. Thirty-six FB-111 bombers have beenmoved to Turkey, while a number of B-52s have been positionedon the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.   They were to join two U.S. aircraft carrier task forcesconverging on the Arabian Peninsula. The USS Eisenhower --which has received the special permission of EgyptianPresident Hosni Mubarak to sail through the Suez Canal intothe Red Sea -- is carrying 80 combat aircraft. TheIndependence, on station off the coast of Oman, is carrying asimilar number of planes.   The U.S. ground forces appear too small in number and toolightly armed to be designed to roll back the 100,000 or soarmored troops that Iraq has massed on the Saudi border.Rather, they are likely to be used mainly to deter an attackon Saudi Arabia and help secure and defend the air baseshousing U.S. planes.   The plan to put American forces in the Middle East was akey part of discussions Defense Secretary Cheney held Mondayin Saudi Arabia with King Fahd. It was during those talksthat the two men apparently agreed on the scope of U.S.involvement.   Mr. Cheney has since been to Egypt, presumably to discussa role for that country in the force, and stopped in Moroccoon his way home last night. This morning, Secretary of StateJames Baker is due to leave for NATO-member Turkey, anothernation whose bases appear to be part of the military noosetightening around Iraq. Mr. Baker will then go to Brussels toconfer with NATO leaders.   Iraq's reported move to position planes in Yemen, SaudiArabia's neighbor to the south, was likely particularlyunsettling to Saudi Arabia, which has a history of tenserelations with the Yemenis. Ali Abdallah Salih, the presidentof Yemen, has openly supported Iraq's Mr. Hussein, and theSaudis may have sensed that they were facing hostile forcesboth in Kuwait, to the north, and in Yemen, to the south.   Last night, the gravest danger for Saudi Arabia was thepossibility of an Iraqi invasion triggered by news reports ofthe U.S. plan. Mr. Hussein, under growing internationaleconomic pressure and facing the arrival of a large andhostile military force near his borders, suddenly had reasonto strike first, U.S. officials feared.   Mr. Bush's &quot;game plan was not to announce this until thetroops were there,&quot; one government official said last night.&quot;Because of the leak, the most dangerous time is right now.&quot;   Mr. Hussein himself delivered a threatening messageyesterday, rejecting foreign pressure on him to withdraw fromKuwait and warning against any outside efforts to force himout. &quot;We would rather die than be humiliated, and we willpluck out the eyes of those who attack the Arab nation,&quot;Baghdad Radio reportedly quoted him as saying.   The deployments to Saudi bases are part of a much largerU.S.-led military effort designed both to prod the Iraqidictator away from Saudi Arabia and, potentially, to roll himout of Kuwait. The plan also involves dispatching dozens ofwarships -- probably including a few from Britain, France andthe USSR -- to stand off the gulf and off ports in Turkey andSaudi Arabia through which Iraqi oil is shipped aftertraveling through pipelines.   These vessels won't immediately block those points,Pentagon officials said, but will be available to do so ifnecessary. So far, a world-wide embargo on trade with Iraq,imposed by the United Nations Monday, has slashed Iraqi oilsales without a blockade.   It was the unusually forceful UN action that gave aninternational legal and political umbrella for the U.S.military move. Another key factor was the recent end of theCold War between the U.S. and the USSR, which led Moscow toband together with the U.S. and which freed smaller nationsfrom worry about angering the Soviets by opposing Iraq, alongtime Kremlin ally.   The first role of the U.S. forces being sent to thePersian Gulf region is to deter the Iraqi leader, reducingthe temptation for him to sweep over the Saudi border anddown the west coast of the Persian Gulf, where Saudi oilfields, oil processing facilities, terminals andpetrochemical operations are strung out.   &quot;The combination of forces and having U.S. air power cancreate a fundamental shift in Saddam Hussein's calculus,&quot;explains Frank Gaffney, director of Washington's Center forSecurity Policy and a former Defense Department official.   Mr. Gaffney believes the U.S. must be prepared to takecombat losses and should be prepared to face an attack bychemical weapons, which Mr. Hussein used against Iranianforces in 1987. He is among a number of U.S. analysts whobelieve that, short of a U.S. intervention, &quot;it was a surething&quot; that Mr. Hussein, a man who has gambled on forcefulsolutions all his life, would have sent his troops over theSaudi border sooner or later.   If Mr. Hussein managed to destroy Saudi productionfacilities, Mr. Gaffney asserts, it would further enrichIraq's position as the holder of the world's second largestpetroleum reserves. &quot;What he's intent on doing is adding tothe value of his primary assets.&quot;   The first priority for U.S. forces if a shooting war doesbreak out is Mr. Hussein's air force, over 500 combataircraft, including a mixture of French Mirage F-1 and SovietMiG fighters and 16 Soviet Tupolev bombers. The Iraqi airforce, according to U.S. analysts, is primarily skilled inair-to-ground missions, such as strafing and bombing.   By deploying some of those warplanes to Yemen, Mr. Husseinmay have hoped to hide them from such a U.S. attack. He usedsimilar scatter tactics to save his planes from destructionduring the eight-year war with Iran, which he initiated in1980.   Iraq's arsenal of Soviet, Chinese and French-builtmissiles must also be taken into account. Chemical-tippedmissiles, for example, could wreak havoc among U.S. troopsand oil workers in the desert, where 120-degree temperatureswould make wearing protective clothing and conductingdecontamination procedures extremely difficult.   To counter such threats, U.S. officials said, Patriotmissiles and other anti-missile systems would also be sent toSaudi Arabia. Also to be dispatched were additional AirborneWarning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, which usecomputers and powerful radar to direct fighters to theirtargets.   If the Iraqi Air Force were destroyed, U.S. analysts said,the matter of dealing with Mr. Hussein's tank-heavy groundforces would be easier. In order to reach the oil fields histanks would have to traverse long desert roads and wouldtherefore be exposed.   Should Iraqi armored columns reach the oil fields, theywould have to be removed without damaging the fields -- adelicate task, considering that the fields are dotted withexpensive terminals and processing plants.   Within 150 miles of the Kuwaiti border are two key Saudifacilities, an $80 billion petrochemical complex at Jubailand a huge oil-loading terminal and refinery complex at RasTanura. An attack on either facility could have an enormousimpact on world markets. U.S., British, French and Sovietnaval forces operating in the Persian Gulf may also be calledinto play to defend the two areas. As the planned deploymentunfolds, the force may assume a multinational character. Inaddition to possible Egyptian forces, the U.S. and SaudiArabia would like Morocco to send troops. Other countriescould also be approached.   On Capitol Hill, reactions were generally positive. Rep.Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,said sending troops makes &quot;a lot of sense&quot; because it givesSaudi Arabia the protection it needs to pump additional oiland make up part of the shortfall caused by the embargo.   &quot;It is a serious business and it's a sign of our will,&quot;Sen. Robert Dole, the Kansas Republican, said after PresidentBush telephoned him about the military move. &quot;We hope SaddamHussein will get the message.&quot;   U.S. units have provisions to sustain themselves formonths in the Persian Gulf region. Pre-positioned shipscontaining food, water, ammunition and heavy weapons arestationed at Diego Garcia, which is outfitted for just such acontingency. But while the U.S. has coveted a militarypresence in the region for years, the White House will facesome political risk if great numbers of U.S. troops remainstuck there for months.   For instance, even amid the support on Capitol Hill lastnight, Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, reacted cautiously. He said it was &quot;important&quot;that Saudi leaders had invited U.S. and other foreign alliesin to protect the kingdom, but that he hoped U.S. groundforces would be used primarily in a defensive role, such asguarding air bases and laying mines. He said he hoped, inturn, that Arab forces, including soldiers from Egypt andMorrocco, would be the troops used to reinforce the Saudiinfantry.   ---   John J.
