 The technique, particularly successful forapplications development, has spread to many corporations.andP;  It speedsrequirements analysis and design, and yields designs that better meet endusers' needs.andM;The basic idea of JAD is to select key end users and conduct workshops thatprogress through a planned set of steps designed to create the systemrapidly.andP;  In the session, IS staff members translate users' requirements intorelevant data models, screen and report designs, process-flow diagrams,decomposition diagrams and rough prototypes.andM;Early JAD sessions were done without automation, but the process is far moreeffective when combined with integrated computer-aided software engineering(I-CASE) tools, which can generate code for complete prototype applications.andM;The skills of the person who organizes and conducts the JAD workshops areparticularly critical to their success.andP;  Usually one person, called the JADleader, runs the session.andM;The job of JAD leader should be regarded as a profession, requiringprofessional skills that take time to develop.andM;JAD leaders are not likely to conduct their first session perfectly.andP;  Onlyafter three or four sessions does the leader gain the necessary confidenceand skill to make the session as effective as possible.andP;  When a JAD sessionfails, it is almost always the fault of the leader.andM;JAD leaders should be chosen mainly for their communications skills.andP;  Theymay come from the end-user or IS community, but in practice, most come fromIS.andP;  Some JAD leaders have been information-center staff members, some have amarketing background, and some are consultants.andM;The JAD leader needs to be diplomatic and disassociated from any politicsthat might affect the session.andP;  Above all, the leader must remain objective.andO;It is his or her job to prepare the session, orchestrate the interactionbetween the participants, confine discussions to a structured framework andmove the session relatively quickly to the required conclusions.andP;  The JADleader acts as the focal point for the views of management, end users and ISprofessionals.andM;The JAD leader needs to research and prepare for the meeting, and to providethe participants with appropriate printed material.andP;  Additionally, JADleaders should be:andM;* comfortable working in front of a group of people;andM;* confident in their ability to direct discussion and fact finding;andM;* able to command the respect of all parties at the session;andM;* well prepared;andM;* knowledgeable about the area of business;andM;* competent in the techniques being used; andandM;* able to control controversies and stay flexible.andM;A good JAD leader knows that certain goals must be accomplished by a giventime.andP;  The JAD leader moves the session forward until the requisite designsare completed, along with screens, reports and, possibly, prototypes.andP;  Thegoal is to discuss ideas fully and reach agreement without much delay.andP;  It isimportant for the session leader to be enthusiastic about JAD and to conveyexcitement to the participants about how well it can work.andM;A corporation may employ an outside consulting firm to run its first JADworkshops until its own JAD leader becomes experienced.andM;For RAD, I recommend full-time--not half-day--participation in JAD workshops.andO;Sessions should usually last five days, since participants tend to spend thefirst two days getting to know one another.andM;Very large applications need to be separated into subsystems with an I-CASEtool that ensures consistent data models and precise interfaces between thesubsystems.andP;  Separate, one-week JAD sessions may then be used for theseparate subsystems.andM;Participants in the JAD workshop should understand four types of diagrams:entity-relationship diagrams; decomposition diagrams; dependency, ordata-flow, diagrams; and action diagrams (used to specify procedural logic).andO;These can usually be taught to end users in a half-day course.andP;  In someorganizations, however, two half-day training sessions are used.andM;Users who have not previously participated in JAD need to become familiarwith what it is and what they are expected to contribute.andM;The users and the JAD leader draw and discuss the diagrams on a white boardor flip charts.andP;  A scribe enters the diagrams into an I-CASE tool set, whichshows how the diagrams relate to one another and provides details of theobjects.andP;  The participants examine the relationships and details on alarge-screen monitor, adjusting the computerized design as the workshopprogresses.andM;In the RAD life cycle, there are two JAD workshops in the user design phase.andO;Before the first workshop, there is a period of preparation, and a kickoffmeeting is held.andM;The initial design of the system is done in the first workshop.andM;To begin, the scope and objectives are reviewed, along with the output of theprevious joint requirements planning (JRP) workshop.andP;  Relevant informationfrom the I-CASE repository is reviewed.andP;  It may be shown &quot;live&quot; on theworkshop's large-screen monitor using the I-CASE tool.andP;  Adjustments may bemade and comments added.andP;  The data model may be discussed and modified.andM;Each process, represented by a process block on the process-flow diagram, isthen examined in detail.andP;  This may be done in five stages:andM;* determining the steps in the procedure;andM;* building an initial data-flow diagram showing the steps;andM;* examining each procedural step in more detail;andM;* creating a partial prototype for each procedural step; andandM;* addressing unresolved issues.andM;The workshop participants should be shown screen designs and prototypes ofthe dialogue.andP;  They should examine and comment on reports the systemproduces.andM;After the first workshop, the design is solidified and cleaned up by ISprofessionals, and prototypes are built; users examine the design documentsgenerated by the I-CASE tool and work with the prototypes.andM;At the second workshop, the experience with the prototypes is reviewed andenhancements to the design discussed.andP;  Substantial design improvements oradditions may be made.andP;  After the second workshop, the design is furthersolidified and then finalized.andM;Preparation for the construction phase should overlap the JAD activity,taking place near the end of the process.andP;  The construction team becomesinvolved after the first JAD workshop, when the design is being consolidatedand the prototypes evaluated.andP;  Members of the team are present at the secondworkshop.andM;The construction team should estimate the amount of work required, which mayindicate that the system be split into subsystems to be developed in parallelby separate teams.andM;The goal of the second workshop is to make a presentation to the executiveowner and allow him or her to question the participants.andP;  The owner must feelcomfortable with the design to give the go-ahead for construction.andM;Next week, I will discuss the concept of SWAT teams--small, highly trainedteams of IS professionals who build the application under deadline.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
