The court ruled that the funds, frozen in several Swissbanks since March 1986, must be returned as soon as acriminal court in the Philippines has issued a &quot;legallybinding&quot; verdict in the case. It gave the Philippines a yearto open the criminal proceedings.   The court said the trial must conform to the standards setin the Swiss Federal Constitution and the European HumanRights Convention, covering chiefly the independence of thejudiciary and the impartiality of judges.   The ruling rejected 11 appeals against lower-courtdecisions to release funds blocked at Credit Suisse in thecanton of Zurich and at Swiss Bank Corp. in the canton ofFribourg. The appeals were filed by lawyers on behalf of Mr.Marcos's widow, Imelda, and others.

Ro Jai Bong, a chief Roh aide and aU.S.-educated university professor, was named to succeedPrime Minister Kang Young Hoon. The new foreign minister willbe Lee Sang Ock, now chief of a mission to internationalagencies in Geneva.                                                                                                          INDIA INCREASES INCOME TAXES   India's Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha introduced a billto increase the surcharge on taxable annual income of over$4,165 to 12% from 8%. He also said deductions ondepreciation would be limited to 75% of the previous maximum.The two proposals were the second money-raising measuresannounced by India's seven-week-old government, which lastweek raised customs and excise duties on a range of goods.                                                                                                          THE FATE OF 6,000 WOMEN                                                                                                          The fate of 6,000 Japanese women married to Koreans willbe raised in next month's scheduled talks between Japaneseand North Koreans in Pyongyang. The women married Koreans whowere forced to work in Japan during its colonial rule of thepeninsula, and then migrated with their husbands to NorthKorea. Since resettling, not one of the women has beenpermitted by North Korea to return to Japan, even to seedying relatives. The talks offer new hope that North Korea,in order to establish diplomatic relations with Japan, willagree to restore freedom of travel to these women.                                                                                                          WELCOME VISITORS                                                                                                          The spending power of the 14,500 European Community civilservants in Brussels totals $978 million a year, whileBrussels-based EC institutions spend $353 million a year onrents, utilities and taxes, according to a study commissionedby the Brussels regional government.

INDONESIA IS WORRIED                                                                                                          Indonesia is worried that its &quot;Visit Indonesia Year 1991&quot;promotion could turn Jakarta into Asia's latest sin city, aJakarta newspaper said. &quot;If there are tourists who come toJakarta seeking `good times,' then they should not have comehere,&quot; the Observer newspaper quoted Jakarta Vice-GovernorBasofi Sudirman as saying.                                                                                                          JAPAN: NO SHARP SLOWDOWN                                                                                                          Japan's Economic Planning Agency said in its annual reportthat it sees no signs of a sharp slowdown in the Japaneseeconomy, but it stressed the need for maintaining pricestability in order to secure sustained growth.   The report noted that the Japanese economy entered itsfifth uninterrupted year of growth in December, underpinnedby domestic demand such as personal consumption and corporatecapital spending. Personal spending and corporate capitaloutlays both continue to grow steadily, while housinginvestment remains at high levels, the report said.   The report added, however, that rising interest rates havestarted restraining housing construction and holding downcorporate sales, earnings and equipment investment by pushingup borrowing costs.   Yesterday, the Ministry of International Trade andIndustry announced that production at Japanese factories andmines went up 6.6% in November from a year earlier, though itdropped 1% from the previous month. Ministry officials saidthe latest statistics indicate that Japan's economic activityremains strong.
