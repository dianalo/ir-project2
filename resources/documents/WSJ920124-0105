That would replace the currentone-time $150 fee that individuals and firms are required topay to the agency.</LP><TEXT>   The debate over investment advisers heightened last monthafter the SEC and federal prosecutors charged a Californiaadviser, Institutional Treasury Management Inc., and itschief, Steven Wymer, with defrauding municipalities of tensof millions of dollars. Even before those charges, however,SEC officials had testified before Congress about theagency's inability to police the massive and fast-growingadviser community.   SEC Chairman Breeden has said that the program is sounderfunded that small advisers are inspected by the SEC anaverage of only once every 30 years, unless some problemarises to attract agency attention.   Mr. Breeden estimated that in the past 10 years, assetsmanaged by advisers have grown tenfold and the number ofadvisers has grown three to four times. The legislationprobably wouldn't deal with what investment industryofficials consider to be an equally large problem -- peoplewho offer investment advice but don't register with the SECas advisers.   Last year, the General Accounting Office identified yetanother problem with the industry, contending in a report toCongress that SEC regulation might do more harm than goodbecause advisers who file with the agency often tout that asa stamp of approval for their business.   Even with all that evidence, legislators have failed toback earlier bills to better regulate the industry. Rep. RickBoucher (D., Va.) has for several years pushed measures thatwould have required investment advisers to inform clientsexactly how they are paid and would have barred advisers frommisrepresenting their qualifications. Those measures alsowould have allowed clients to sue advisers in the event offraud.   But the bills were mowed down by opposition from lawyers,accountants, stockbrokers and others who sell financialproducts. They worried that the bills would create a legaldefinition of who is an investment adviser, while at the sametime not acknowledging thousands of others who sellinvestment products, such as lawyers and insurance agents.   This year, the SEC and backers of the legislation areusing the emotional Wymer case as a lever for the issue. Inthat case, small towns, city school districts and pensionfunds invested with Mr. Wymer, who allegedly promised heftyreturns on government securities. Mr. Wymer's lawyers havedenied any wrongdoing by their client.   Staffers for the House Telecommunications and FinanceSubcommittee are piecing together a package of proposals thatwould raise fees on advisers, provide better information tocustomers and encourage state regulators to develop statutesto regulate financial planners, who also would be defineddifferently from advisers. Hearings on the legislative planare expected to be held this spring.   The effort is likely to get a boost from the SEC, which isnow actively working on its own plan. One idea that appearsnow to be out of favor is establishing a &quot;self-regulatoryorganization&quot; similar to the National Association ofSecurities Dealers to regulate the advisers. Instead, Mr.Breeden told the Senate Securities Subcommittee yesterdaythat the SEC would like to take on the responsibility itself,doubling or tripling its current staff of 140 that monitorsboth advisers and the mutual fund industry.   To pay for the program, advisers would pay fees that theSEC chairman estimated would range from &quot;a couple hundreddollars a year&quot; to more for advisers with larger assets undermanagement.</TEXT></DOC>
