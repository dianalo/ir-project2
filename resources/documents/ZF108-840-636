(product introduction).andO;Product:   Toshiba T1200XE (Portable computer) (marketing)CASE:W 3.0 (CASE software) (marketing)Intelligent Query (Report generating software) (marketing)Microsoft Windows 3.0 (Graphical user interface) (productenhancement).andO;Topic:     Trade ShowsLaptop ComputersCompatible SoftwareComdex-Spring.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Invasion of Atlanta: COMDEX Spring '90andM;If COMDEX Spring '90 had a theme, it was &quot;you can take it with you.&quot;andP;  Laptopcomputers were everywhere, more powerful, smaller, and, occasionally, evencheaper.andM;Toshiba seemed to be the popular leader, with laptops ranging from theirsix-pound T1000XE with a 20M drive to the T3100SX 386SX VGA with a 80M driveto the so-hot-you-can't-get-'em T1200XE eight-pound 286 with 20M drive andvery bright 640x400 screen.andP;  Toshiba also showed a cellular modem connectionto their laptops for the ultimate in mobility.andM;Sharp showed two breakthrough models: A delightful compact four-pound 286notebook computer with a 20M drive and VGA screen.andP;  Unfortunately, it was toodim to read.andP;  We could only look and not touch Sharp's prototype color-screenlaptop.andP;  Prices will have to come down, but the quality of this newtechnology is rising quickly.andM;GRiD Systems' new GRiDPAD laptop accepts handwritten input.andP;  R2Z offersPadBASE+, a Clipper library to develop GRidPAD applications, which should bevery popular with non-typists and field personnel who need to use a computeras a clipboard.andP;  The main issue is input accuracy.andP;  The units I examineddemanded careful printing and weren't especially fast.andM;Another touch-screen totable drew crowds.andP;  MicroSlate, Inc.'s Datellite 300Lsports a 386SX processor and VGA graphics.andP;  The company also offersDataSlate, a touch-screen applications generator that lets you create simpledata-entry applications by making choices from menus.andP;  Data is maintained inthe dBASE DBF format.andM;Everyone was talking about the recent introduction of Windows 3.0,thoughMicrosoft didn't exhibit at COMDEX.andP;  In fact, very few software firms did,preferring to show their wares at PC Expo in New york two weeks later.andO;(COMDEX is supposedly for dealers and corporate buyers.andP;  PC Expo issupposedly for corporate buyers.andP;  End users are tolerated at both.)andM;Among Windows 3.0 news, CASEWORKS, Inc. said it will soon unveil version 3.0of CASE: W, a Windows 3.0 version of its computer-aided software engineeringtool.andP;  CASE: W can prototype and generate source code for the interfaceportion of an application being develop under Windows.andP;  It sells for$795.andO;The company sells another version for OS/2, called CASE: PM.andP;  The applicationfiles created under CASE: W can be directly transported to CASE: PM.andM;MATESYS Corp. showed another Windows 2.0/3.0 interface tool, Object Script.andO;This visual command language lets you add icons, buttons, and edit boxes toapplications, allowing the usual nifty Windows features such as multipleapplications running simultaneously and links between applications supportingthe DYNAMIC Data Exchange protocol.andP;  Object View, another MATESYS offering,is a Windows front-end for Microsoft's SQL Server.andP;  Other versions will soonappear for Oracle, Gupta's SQLBase, and DB2.andM;Fox Software drew a steady crowd to continual FoxPro demonstrations.andP;  Fox wasone of the very few software firms exhibiting in the main Georgia WorldandM;Congress Center.andP;   SeveralandM;smaller vendors presented interesting new products at Inforum a few blockaway.andM;SemWare, makers of the popular QEdit, showed both new version 2.10 and a TSRversion that takes just 9K (through swapping).andP;  Finally, a real programmer'seditor that's always available.andP;  Sidekick users, take a look.andM;dB RACE, $399 from LodeStone, Inc. of Webster, Texas, claims to speed DBFdatabase access even more than speed-burners like FoxPro.andP;  dB RACE can beused as a stand-alone or as a 7K to 9K TSR loaded with dBASE III PLUS/IV,FoxBASE+/Pro, Clipper, dBXL, or any other program that uses DBFs.andP;  Using apatented method of processing information, it searches, sorts, and maintainsits own indexes.andP;  Db RACE indexes are very small, and the claimed speedincreases are substantial.andP;  The program is described as a general query tool,not a replacement for SEEK.andM;Another intriguing products comes from Programmed Intelligence Corp.andP;  TheirIntelligent Query is a report writer that retrieves data by first creating adata dictionary specific to the application being queried.andP;  The user isprompted through a series of menus to create SQL-like commands that generatethe desired report.andP;  It can run under DOS, UNIX and XENIX.andP;  VAX/VMS, andother platforms and works with a host of database management systems.andP;  Thecompany appears to prefer to cut bundling deals with database vendors (whohook it onto their systems as a reporting tool), but others can license ittoo (starting price: $1,500 for three users).andM;A successor to my favorite remote access software, pcAnywhre IV, is scheduledfor August release from EKD Computer Corp. (it may be out by the time youread this).andP;  ALAN version will allow remote access between workstations, aswell as modem sharing across the network.andM;Atlanta-based Complementary Solutions, Inc. announced Automate/Anytime ($99)at the show.andP;  This utility automatically runs PC tasks according to auser-defined schedule.andP;  For example, at midnight, you could handle thoseodious data back-up or batch-file processing jobs.andM;* CASEWORKS, Inc., (404) 399-6236andM;* Complementary Solutions, Inc., (404) 454-8033andM;* Fox Software, Inc., (419) 874-0162andM;* GRID Systems Corp., (415) 656-4700andM;* LodeStone, (803) 842-6047andM;* MATESYS Corp., (202) 785-0770andM;* MicroSlate, Inc., (514) 444-3680andM;* Programmed Intelligence Corp., (404) 446-8880andM;* SemWare Software Products, (404) 641-9002andM;* Sharp Electronics Corp., (201) 529-8817andM;* Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc., Computer Division, (714)583-3000</TEXT></DOC>
