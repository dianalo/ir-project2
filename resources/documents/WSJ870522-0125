This, says the Carnegie Forum on Education and the Economy, presents an opportunity to bring reform to public schools and to enhance the teaching profession. To this end, it has just announced a National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.    The creation of such a board was in the recommendations the forum made last year in its well-received report, &quot;A Nation Prepared: Teachers for the 21st Century.&quot; As Carnegie envisions, the board will formulate standards for the teaching profession and certify teachers who meet the standards. It has in mind a certification process that resembles those of the legal and medical professions.    The board would grant two types of certificates: an entry-level &quot;teacher's certificate&quot; and an &quot;advanced teacher's certificate.&quot; The former would certify teachers' basic competence, their grasp of subjects they intend to teach and their ability to manage a classroom. The latter would confirm exceptional qualifications and leadership abilities in seasoned teachers.    At present, teachers dominate the board, including the presidents of the nation's two largest teachers unions. This raises some fear that unions may exert inordinate control over the certification process, or that they might effectively force new teachers to enter the profession through union membership. The president of the American Association of School Administrators, June Gabler, asserts that the certification plan amounts to &quot;an attempted takeover of American schools by the teacher unions.&quot;    Though it eventually would like to see nationally certified teachers in public schools throughout the land, Carnegie says state and local education authorities would in no way be obliged to accept the new national standards. It hopes, however, that state and local school boards ultimately will see the merit of either including the national standard in their licensing requirements, or waiving state requirements for nationally certified teachers.    Carnegie anticipates some resistance, but it expects to win cooperation from school systems by employing something of a market strategy. The key, it says, is to earn the confidence of parents, who act as consumers in the educational marketplace. Discerning parents will be inclined to enroll their children in school systems boasting the best teachers. If parents come to associate national certification with the &quot;best&quot; instructors, they'll insist that their childrens' schools employ such teachers.    Teachers also will benefit from national certification, says Carnegie. As demand for highly competent certified teachers increases, their market value also will increase. As teachers acquire greater status, better qualified students will enter the field. Teaching will become less an occupation and more a profession.    Carnegie doesn't hold out teacher certification as a panacea for the ills plaguing many American schools. Those problems are too numerous and complex to be solved by one measure. But the Carnegie proposal is a serious and welcome effort to improve the quality of instruction and to restore parents' confidence in the public-school system. </TEXT></DOC>
