John Doerr, general partner with Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield andamp; Byers,a venture-capital firm in San Francisco with investments in MacroMind Inc.,andO;Symantec Corp. and other Mac-related companies.andP;  By increasing the number ofMacs that move out the door, Doerr said, the market opportunities increasefor everyone.andM;Software developers agreed that a wider Mac user base is helping Applemaintain a strong market in a weak economy.andP;  New Mac customers, they said,seem most interested in products that clearly make their businesses moreproductive and offer concrete savings.andM;&quot;I think the products that are selling now are the ones that clearly savepeople money,&quot; said John Warnock, CEO of Adobe Systems Inc. of Mountain View,Calif.andP;  &quot;The desktop publishing market has always been productivity-oriented,so we continue to do well.&quot;andM;Michael Hallman, president of Microsoft Corp., also reported continued growthin sales of his company's Mac applications.andP;  &quot;We have not seen a significantimpact on our growth from problems in the economy,&quot; said Hallman.andP;  &quot;We arevery broadly diversified both product-wise and geographically, and thathelps.&quot;andM;In fact, several Mac developers said that Apple's strong growth ininternational markets, especially Japan, is helping to offset any slowdown inthe United States.andM;&quot;We're quite bullish on Japan,&quot; said Sculley.andP;  &quot;We expect the Japanese marketto evolve into our second-largest market.&quot; Europe ranks second to the UnitedStates as an Apple market (see story, Page 28).andM;If one factor in the company's resurgence during tough economic times is tobe given more credit than others, observers said, it would have to be Apple'srecent attitude adjustment.andP;  By facing up to the hard realities of acompetitive marketplace where Apple is in the minority, the Cupertino,Calif., developer is better prepared to face the challenges of 1991.andM;&quot;Apple executives are asking questions that would have gotten them fired twoyears ago,&quot; Shaffer said.andP;  &quot;If that ultimately translates into a strongercompany with larger market share, it could spell a big turnaround in '91 forApple.&quot;andM;Paris -- Demonstrating the growing importance of the overseas market forApple, Apple Europe reported sales for fiscal 1990, ended Sept.andP;  30, of $1.5billion, up 28 percent from 1989.andM;Apple Europe, one of four Apple operating units, accounted for more than 28.4percent of the corporation's total 1990 revenue of almost $5.6 billion.andP;  Thedivision's jurisdiction includes all of Europe plus Africa, the Middle Eastand the Soviet Union.andM;According to the announcement, Apple credits its growth to the success of itsefforts to localize its products overseas.andP;  High-performance products, suchas the Mac IIfx, also helped make inroads for Apple.andM;About 20 percent of Apple Europe's 1990 revenues came from education sales.andO;The report cited the success of an aggressive test marketing campaigntargeted at students in Germany, Spain and Denmark last spring.andM;New York -- Investors who bought Apple stock at the Oct.andP;  15 introduction ofthe low-cost Macs are reaping the rewards for their faith in the company'snew machines.andM;Apple stock sank to a 52-week low of $24.25 as the Mac IIsi, LC and Classicmade their debuts.andP;  At the time, analysts attributed the drop to Wall Streetqualms about Apple's new lower-margin strategy on top of the fears of war andrecession that were dragging down the whole market and the technology sectorin particular.andM;But in the two months since the rollout, with sales of the Classic and IIsiexceeding all projections, Apple stock has become a hot property.andP;  The priceof its shares jumped 74 percent from the October low to close at $42.50 onDec.andP;  7 before slipping back to $39.63 last Wednesday.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
