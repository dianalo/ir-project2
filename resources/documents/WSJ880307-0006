This week's report on overall February retail sales is expected to be lackluster, with many analysts expecting a gain of not much more than 0.5%-flat with or slightly better than January's 0.5% rise.    The estimates reflect the unexpectedly weak February sales reported last week by individual major retailers. Paine Webber's index of chain store sales for the month eked out a 0.5% gain from a year earlier, following a 3.7% jump the previous month.    Much of the thrust in the broad retail sector lately has come from auto sales. Late-February sales of North American-built cars jumped a surprising 24%, thanks partly to buyer incentive programs, according to figures out last week. That end-of-the-month spurt boosted total February sales to 889,301 cars -- the highest total for any February since 1973.    Still, cars alone can't carry the economy.    &quot;The major hole in consumer sales is in women's apparel,&quot; says David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago.    Mr. Hale and others say women don't seem to be responding to shorter skirts as retailers had hoped. &quot;We need a hemline adjustment to the figures as well as a seasonal adjustment,&quot; he says.    Sluggish spending in the big retail sector is worrisome because it could cause stores to cut back on orders, forcing manufacturers to trim output and workers. Laidoff workers are hesitant to buy, so a downdraft in spending can feed on itself.    More cause for worry came in the latest report from the nation's corporate purchasers, who believe that the economy's growth rate slowed in February and that output is likely to slip this month.    The National Association of Purchasing Management reported a sharp drop in the rate of new orders, which helped drag the purchasing managers index down 2.5 percentage points to 54.9% -- its lowest level since April 1987. The index measures new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventory and employment and is considered a reliable indicator of business activity for the following month.    On the brighter side, employment was surprisingly strong last month.    The economy created about 500,000 jobs in February, according to Friday's Labor Department report. That dropped the civilian unemployment rate 0.1 percentage point to 5.7% -- the lowest jobless pace since summer 1979.    But many economic analysts expect unemployment to start creeping up again soon if the recent high output isn't moved out of inventory and into consumers' hands.    Weak chain-store sales in February are particularly notable because they come when consumer confidence readings are high.    The Sindlinger Consumer Confidence Percent clocks in at a healthy 66.1% for the three days ended last Thursday, up a full percentage point from a week earlier.    Albert E. Sindlinger, chairman of Wallingford, Pa.-based Sindlinger Economic Services, points out that the reading is nowhere near forecasting a recession. The indicator is higher than its reading of 63.1% at the end of November 1987, and it is well above the year-earlier 53.1%. During the last recession in 1982, it bottomed out at 38.5% during the first week of March.    Mr. Sindlinger explains that some of the confusion about the economy's course stems from geography.    &quot;The U.S. has become like the Balkans,&quot; he says. &quot;We have all these different 'states' -- the Farm Belt, the Rust Belt, the oil belt, the mineral belt and the financial belt.&quot;    Mr. Sindlinger notes that almost all the job growth lately is concentrated in the Midwest and farm states, which are emerging from their own local recessions, while the Eastern states are slacking off from good times.    The 33-year-old Sindlinger survey measures what Mr. Sindlinger calls &quot;household money supply&quot; gathered from bread-and-butter questions on recent -- and expected -- income, spending and local job security.    This week's reports on consumer credit and the producer price index will give economists more clues to the pace of both makers and buyers. MMS International, a market analyst in Redwood City, Calif., expects that January consumer credit rose about $3.7 billion from December's $621.44 billion, while producer prices in February inched up about 0.3% compared with January's 0.5% rise. Analysts at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. figure credit demands centered on autos while producer prices were eased a bit by moderated energy costs.    EXTREME COSTS OF LIVING: The cost of both mundane and magnificent necessities are loping past the government's standard Consumer Price Index, according to two independent indicators.    Manufacturers Hanover Corp., which compiles a cost-of-living index focusing on small-ticket everyday essentials such as food, personal grooming products and entertainment, says its January index rose 4.7% from a year earlier, compared with a 4.4% rise in the CPI, which also includes big-ticket durable goods. Since 1986, the bank's index has risen 8.8%, compared with a 5.7% increase in the CPI.    On the other side of the tracks, champagne maker Moet andamp; Chandon says its Moet Index -- which measures a market basket of luxuries including a mink coat, caviar and Dom Perignon champagne -- jumped 9% in 1987, compared with a 4.4% rise in the CPI.    ---                  THE ECONOMY IN NUMBERS            Statistics Released in the Past Week   CHANGE                                                  (from prior                                        TOTAL     period)    MONEY SUPPLY M1 Week ended Feb.22 ( in billions)    $762.1    +$2.2 M2 Week ended Feb.22 (in trillions)    $2.9528   +$.0064 M3 Week ended Feb.22 (in trillions)    $3.7242   +$.0027    Mfg.
