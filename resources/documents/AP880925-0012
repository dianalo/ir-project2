Right now, however, trees represent one of the Earth's worstenemies.   Left alone, trees are storage ``sinks'' that consume largequantities of carbon dioxide, the worst of the greenhouse gasesthat scientists say are collecting in the atmosphere and trappingheat that once escaped into space.   But a tree felled by a logger or consumed by fire is doublydangerous: not only will it no longer consume carbon dioxide, itsdeath releases stored carbon dioxide to join the atmosphericaccumulation that scientists say will produce major global climatechanges in the 21st century.   The scientists' warnings are coming at a time when forests,particularly in developing nations, are being destroyed at recordrates, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee was toldlast week.   Focusing on the role of forests in the greenhouse equation, thecommittee heard that the headline-grabbing forest fires thatravaged some 4 million acres of the American West this summer wererelatively small potatoes.   ``It is generally agreed that global deforestation, particularlyin the tropics, accounts for approximately 20 percent of the annualinjection of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,'' said DanielDudek, senior economist for the Environmental Defense Fund.   ``Annually, forest destruction producing these emissions equalsan area slightly larger than the state of Indiana, or more than24.5 million acres,'' he said. ``This global total dwarfs our owndomestic losses this summer.''   David Wirth, senior attorney with the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, said that because of ``massive destruction'' of forests,``Brazil currently ranks third, after the United States and theSoviet Union, in overall contribution to the carbon burden of theatmosphere.''   Cutting down tropical forests to bring land into agriculture isespecially critical in the Amazon basin, according to RobertMcNeal, of NASA's earth sciences and applications division.   ``If only half of the Amazon basin were covered with forests, itwould absorb 20 percent of the carbon which is presently releasedinto the atmosphere'' globally, he said.   He also said the basin is the source of about 12 percent of themethane, another greenhouse gas, that reaches the atmosphere fromwetlands. Replacing forests with wetlands or rice agriculture wouldlikely mean more methane production in the tropics, he said.   Committee witnesses said that unlike the United States andEurope, which actively plant new trees to replace harvestedforests, many Third World trees are not replaced.   ``Only a very small percentage of the world's tropical forestsare being managed,'' said Richard Bissell, assistant administratorof the U.S. Agency for International Development, which is nowstressing resource management to countries receiving its assistance.   Planting new forests to absorb carbon dioxide sounds like asimple solution _ until its magnitude is considered.   ``Sequestering five gigatons per year of carbon from theatmosphere, an amount roughly equal to current annual additions,would require between 1.28 billion and 1.65 billion acres of newplantation forests,'' Dudek said. ``By comparison, the total landarea of the United States is 2.27 billion acres.''   Gregg Marland of the environmental sciences division of OakRidge National Laboratory estimated that under current U.S. forestmanagement practices, this nation would need about 4 billion acresof trees to offset its emissions of carbon dioxide into theatmosphere from all sources.   The witnesses said a minimum anti-greenhouse strategy requiresthat new sources of carbon to the atmosphere should be offset bycarbon traps, such as new trees.   Marland gave a formula for offsetting carbon dioxide emissionsfrom a coal-fired 1,000 megawatt power plant: surround it withsycamores spaced four feet apart to a radius of 15.3 miles andharvest the trees every four years because younger trees absorbmore carbon dioxide than mature trees.   Gary Moll, vice president of the American Forestry Association,said Third World tropical forests are not the only places trees arebeing lost.   ``Our urban forests are dying,'' he said. ``A 1987 survey doneby the association indicated that on average four (urban) trees aredying or being removed for every new one planted today,'' he said.   ``We estimate that there are somewhere on the order of 100million `tree spaces' in urban communities where new trees areurgently needed,'' Moll said. ``Planting those trees could resultin a savings of ... as much as 18 million tons of carbon dioxideproduction a year.''   Dale Robertson, chief of the U.S. Forest Service said that treesoffer a partial solution to global warming, but he sounded anominous note about the droughts that scientists say will be part ofthe greenhouse process.   Robertson said the dry years have had ``a serious effect on ourforest resources,'' sparking killer fires, weakening seedlings andleaving drought-stressed trees more susceptible to insect attack.   ``A serious potential effect of a change in our world's climatewould be changes in tree growth and yield,'' Robertson said.</TEXT></DOC>
