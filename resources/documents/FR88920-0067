Background </ITAG>Under section 1816 of the Social Security Act (the Act), public or privateorganizations and agencies participate in the administration of Part Aof the Medicare program (Hospital Insurance) under agreements with theSecretary of HHS. These agencies or organizations are known as fiscal intermediaries,and they perform bill processing and benefit payment functions for theMedicare program. Most providers of services (such as hospitals, skillednursing facilities (SNFs), and home health agencies (HHAs)) submit billsto these intermediaries, which determine whether the services are coveredunder Medicare and determine correct payment amounts. The intermediariesthen make payments to the providers on behalf of the beneficiaries. Under section 1842 of the Act, we are authorized to enter into contractswith carriers to fulfill various functions in the administration of PartB of the Medicare program (Supplementary Medical Insurance). Beneficiaries,physicians and suppliers of services submit claims to these carriers. Thecarriers determine whether the services are covered under Medicare andthe reimbursable amount (usually on the basis of reasonable charges) forthe services or supplies and then make payment to the appropriate party.A. Current Fiscal Intermediary and Carrier Budget Process Oversight of intermediary and carrier performance by HCFA is exercisedby staff of both the central office and regional office (RO). In general,national policies are addressed at the central office level, and regionaland local policies and operations are addressed by the regional offices.Communication between HCFA and the intermediaries and carriers is continuous,and established consultation workgroups consist of representatives of centraloffice, regional offices and contractors. HCFA central office is responsible for developing a national contractorbudget for both Part A and Part B of the Medicare program. The budget isformulated over a 15-month period beginning March of the year precedingthe budget year to which it applies. It is formulated after input fromHCFA's ROs, various central office components, the contractor community,several levels in the Department of HHS, and the Executive Office of Managementand Budget (EOMB), prior to submittal to the President for approval andforwarding to Congress. Our past practice has involved use of the HCFA ROs in obtaining budgetestimates from the contractors. The RO's assessment of the contractor'sneeds is reviewed during a proposed budget level determination processbased on current claims processing trends, legislative mandates, administrativeinitiatives, and the availability of funds appropriated by Congress. Wesubsequently allocate funding within these constraints. B. New Legislation Section 4035(a) of Pub. L. 100-203, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Actof 1987, (OBRA 87), amended sections 1816(c)(1) and 1842(c)(1) of the Actby requiring the Secretary to publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, by no later than September 1 before each fiscalyear, the final data, standards, and methodology to be used to establishbudgets for fiscal intermediaries and carriers under these sections forthat fiscal year. We also are required to publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for public comment, at least 90 days before thatdate (September 1), the data, standards, and methodology we propose touse. We have been unable to meet the statutory mandate to publish a proposednotice at least 90 days before September 1, as well as the requirementto publish the final data, standards, and methodology by September 1. Althoughwe have not published the proposed and final notices within the timeframescontemplated by the statute, we nevertheless want to assure interestedparties that they will be provided an adequate opportunity to comment onthe data, standards, and methodology to be used to establish budgets beforethey are issued in final. We will therefore promptly take steps to respondto all comments and will publish a final notice as soon as possible. To the extent that comments received warrant revisions to the proposeddata, standards, and methodology, we will make such changes before issuingthe final data, standards, and methodology. Moreover, if appropriate, wewill issue revised budget guidelines to intermediaries and carriers. Wewill also renegotiate any affected areas of intermediary and carrier budgetswithin the level of funding made available by Congress. <ITAG tagnum="85">II. Overview of Fiscal Year 1989 National Medicare Contractor BudgetData, Standards and Methodology </ITAG>The FY 1989 Medicare contractor budget request was submitted to Congressin February 1988. In order to determine the amount of the FY 1989 request,we projected a workload growth under Part A of 5 percent and Part B of9.3 percent. Our estimate involved the use of a regression model whichuses the last 36 months of actual contractor workload data. For the FY1989 projections, we used November, 1987 data. These data were the latestavailable at the time. The results of the regression yielded an FY 1989Part A workload of 74 million bills and 402.6 million Part B claims. The regression model provides us with not only national totals, but individualcontractor workload projections. Based on the projected FY 1988 unit costs for processing bills and claims,we then applied a 4.1 percent inflation factor. This amount is then furtheradjusted for incremental workload efficiencies, cost efficiency benchmark,savings achieved by prior productivity investments and costs associatedwith new legislation. This calculation results in a new unit cost, which,when multiplied by the Part A and/or Part B workloads, shows the totalamount to be earmarked for bills and claims payment in FY 1989. A. Medicare Contractor Functional Areas The Medicare contractor budget consists of seven functional area responsibilitiesperformed by intermediaries for Part A and seven functional area responsibilitiesperformed by carriers for Part B. The functional area responsibilitiesfor Part A are: (1) Bills Payment; (2) Reconsiderations and Hearings; (3)Medicare Secondary Payer; (4) Medical Review and Utilization; (5) ProviderAudit (Desk Reviews, Field Audits and Provider Settlements); (6) ProviderReimbursement; and (7) Productivity Investments. The functional area responsibilitiesfor Part B are: (1) Claims Payment; (2) Reviews and Hearings; (3) Beneficiary/PhysicianInquiries; (4) Medical Review and Utilization Review; (5) Medicare SecondaryPayer; (6) Participating Physicians; and (7) Productivity Investments.The data, standards and methodology used in these functional areas arediscussed in section III, below. In the following national budget summary,we have combined the discussion of functional areas common to both intermediariesand carriers. However, data specific to Part A and Part B are providedunder each heading. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Bills Payment and Claims Payment </ITAG>We currently estimate the Part A workload to be 74.0 million bills in FY1989. This estimate results from a workload regression model which usesthe last 36 months of intermediary data through November 1987 with a 5.0percent growth factor. Intermediaries are required by section 9311 of Pub.L. 99-509, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA 86), topay 95 percent of clean Part A bills within 25 days of receipt. The Part B workload is currently projected at 402.6 million claims witha 9.3 percent growth rate. All Part B claims must be processed within thesame timeframes as Part A bills, except that participating physician claimsmust be paid within 18 days of receipt. Section 4031 of OBRA 87 imposes a 14-day payment floor standard effectiveOctober 1, 1988 for Part A bills and Part B claims. This standard providesthat no payment may be made within 14 calendar days after the date on whichthe bill/claim is received. Section 4031 also prohibits the Secretary fromissuing before October 1, 1990, other regulations, instructions or policiesintended to slow down Medicare payments. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Reconsiderations (Reviews under Part B) and Hearings </ITAG>This function includes all activities related to guaranteeing due processof law as a result of contractor action (i.e., disallowances) on billsand claims. As a result of both inflation and workload increases (appealsof denials and carrying out new legislative requirements), the need forhearings and reconsiderations funding has increased significantly duringthe past two years. Based upon past experience and current data (throughMarch 1988), we expect an 18.5 percent increase in the Part A hearingsand reconsiderations workload in FY 1989 and a 9.6 percent increase inthe Part B reviews and hearings workload. Section 4032 of OBRA 1987 amended section 1816(f) of the Act to requirethat intermediaries process 66 percent of reconsiderations within 60 daysfor FY 1989. Consequently, FY 1989 funding levels will attempt to meetthe increase in hearings and reconsiderations. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Medicare Secondary Payer </ITAG>The Medicare Secondary Payer function is the first of three initiatives(Medicare Secondary Payer, Medical Review and Utilization Review, and ProviderAudit) we developed as ``Payment Safeguards'' in an attempt to safeguardthe Medicare program against improper payments. The focus of the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) initiative is to ensurethat the Medicare program pays for covered care only after reimbursementfrom other primary insurers has been made. An intermediary and a carriermust administer the program in a manner which achieves maximum savingsand cost avoidance to the Medicare trust funds. Medicare Secondary Payeractivities center on claims involving: The working aged; spousal workingaged; beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease; beneficiaries eligiblefor payment under automobile, medical liability and no-fault insurance;individuals eligible for or receiving workers compensation; and the disabled.By concentrating efforts in these key areas, the Medicare program has hadtremendous success in recovering and reducing improper program payments.Medicare contractors are responsible for identifying MSP situations andaggressively pursuing the recovery of improper payments from the appropriateparty. In conjunction with the actuary, we develop specific savings goalsfor each contractor based on past performance. In FY 1989, we expect todevote $34 million to Part A intermediaries' MSP efforts and achieve over$1 billion in savings. We expect to devote $35 million to Part B carriers'MSP efforts and achieve almost $300 million in savings. The standard for determining the amount of MSP funding a contractor willreceive in FY 1989 is based on savings goals, workload volumes, requiredsystems changes, and any special projects which may be assigned to contractors.We gather actual MSP claims volume, overall claims volume for the priorfiscal year, and special project data (e.g., cost of claims, amount ofsavings achieved). We compare a contractor's previous year's data to thecontractor's projections for the next fiscal year and allocate fundingin proportion to the savings goals to be achieved. Additional funding isallocated for specific projects as required. The amounts vary based onthe scope of the project, extent of systems changes if any, and workload.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Medical Review and Utilization Review </ITAG>In addition to processing and paying claims from providers of servicesand Medicare beneficiaries, the contractors perform a medical review (MR)of claims to determine whether services were medically necessary and constitutedan appropriate level of care. Fiscal intermediaries are responsible for medical review of services deliveredin other than an inpatient acute care setting; e.g., outpatient, HHA, SNF,etc. This review assures that medical care is necessary and appropriateand that quality medical services are delivered to Medicare beneficiaries.During FY 1989, the review of HHA and outpatient services will accountfor most of the increase in utilization of medical review resources. Medicalreview of all freestanding HHA provider claims will be the responsibilityof regional home health intermediaries. In addition, the following increases in medical review activity levelsare planned: Restoration of level of HHA compliance audits to 1987 levels;increase level of HHA MR to 60 percent; increase level of hospital outpatientMR to 10 percent; increase level of MR of other bills to 10 percent; studyof prior authorization for HHA and SNF claims; and expansion of capabilityto develop beneficiary and provider utilization profiles. We project that intermediary medical review costs will be $71.8 millionin FY 1989. By performing appropriate medical and utilization review, weproject a cost avoidance of $358.5 million in medically unnecessary serviceswill be achieved. In FY 1989, we will continue to refine the standard cost analysis systemdeveloped in FY 1987 to evaluate the efficiency of carrier prepayment medicalreview screens. This sytematic approach is expected to yield benefits tothe medical review process, such as: (1) A current inventory of the number,types and cost effectiveness of medical review screens; (2) ability toanalyze the current inventory of screens and set a framework that yieldsa high return on investment; (3) ability to target strategies for specificmedical review activities; and (4) measurement of the relative cost effectivenessof screens among different contractors. In FY 1989, we intend to intensify the focus of prepayment review includingadditional mandatory prepayment screens. We also intend to develop andimplement additional postpayment medical review screens.The carrier postpayment process consists of preparing profiles of providersand beneficiaries, identifying patterns of fraud and abuse, correctingprogram abuse or overutilization, preventing further abuse in service utilizationby educating providers in acceptable norms and proper billing practices,recommending administrative action, where appropriate, and identifyingareas for the development and installation of future prepayment reviewscreens.The actual and cost avoidance benefits in safeguarding program dollarsare significant. Educational encounters lead to fewer incorrect billingsand administrative cost avoidance in the form of reductions in the numberof requests for reviews and hearings. We intend to focus on intensifiedreview of providers with demonstrably aberrant billing and practice patterns,increased educational efforts and the development of methodology for quantifyingthe level of program and administrative cost avoidance resulting from postpaymentmedical review activities.In addition, in FY 1989 we will implement a more focused process for selectingproviders for comprehensive review and conduct postpayment studies of areasof perceived program vulnerability. We plan to mandate carrier review ofphysicians with significant Medicare income increases. Finally, we expectto direct carriers to increase the number of physician/suppliers subjectto postpayment analysis by 50 percent.We also plan the following additional FY 1989 carrier medical review initiativesin support of the traditional medical review process:andbullet; Medical Review Policy DevelopmentThis effort focuses on strengthening the professional consultation rolein the development of medical review policy. Upon implementation, carrierswill be required to employ a physician to develop medical policy and tohave in place a provider communication system that ensures all new andrevised policies are appropriately disseminated prior to their implementation.andbullet; Enhanced Data Analysis.Under this effort HCFA will intensify the review of pattern of practicedata to strengthen the focus of postpayment reviews. We plan to analyzecarrier medical review cost avoidance data to develop additional cost-effectivescreens.In order to carry out this ambitious agenda of enhanced carrier medicalreview, designed to address overutilization of services and the resultantimpact on program expenditures, we project the carrier medical review costswill be $124.2 million in FY 1989. These costs would be offset by avoidingpayment for medically unnecessary services through proper medical review/utilizationreview. We anticipate approximately $975.0 million in FY 1989 expenditureswould be avoided by our action to not pay for medically unnecessary services.Carriers will be expected to continue to provide support to HHS/Officeof Inspector General (OIG) in developing cases of suspected fraud and abuse.Intermediaries and carriers are expected to play a more active role inthe detection and handling of fraud and abuse cases. The primary programintegrity role of intermediaries and carriers is to identify and developsuspected fraud and abuse cases for referral to the OIG.In abuse cases, the contractors have an even greater responsibility becausecorrection and prevention of abuse are among their basic functions. Inaddition to other duties, contractors will be required to establish andmaintain program integrity units; conduct ongoing employee training onfraud and abuse goals, techniques and control; develop guidelines for timelyprocessing of all potential fraud and abuse cases; establish and maintainhistories and documentation on all program integrity cases, and conductperiodic reviews to identify any patterns of potential fraud and abusesituations for particular providers. In FY 1989, HCFA will require thatall intermediaries and carriers implement the above procedures.The distribution of funding is in proportion to workload and individualcontractor MR/UR projects.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Provider Audit</ITAG>In FY 1989, the audit of provider cost reports will continue as a majorprogram safeguard initiative. Hospital Insurance program payments for servicesto beneficiaries are expected to exceed $70 billion by FY 1989, and theaudit of provider cost reports is the primary instrument with which theintegrity of these funds is maintained. Historically, the audit processhas recovered millions of dollars in improper program payments each year.In FY 1989 we expect to achieve savings of $820 million.In the FY 1989 audit plan, hospital audits will be expanded to addressreimbursement issues introduced by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1985 (COBRA), OBRA 1986 and OBRA 1987. These issues include disproportionateshare payments, graduate medical education costs, return on equity capitalfor inpatient services, wage index surveys, and the implementation of anew electronic cost reporting system.Approximately 683 more providers (new HHAs and SNFs) will be subject toaudit under cost-based principles of reimbursement in FY 1989 than wereaudited in FY 1988.The data show that there has been a decrease of the hospitals (4.1 percent)under the prospective payment system (PPS) that are single entity providers,and an increase of 175 hospitals (7.6 percent) under PPS with excludedunits and other subproviders which are exempt from PPS. Since there isgreater potential for improper payments to be made to PPS hospitals withexempt units and subproviders, this trend indicates that a high percentageof multi-facility PPS hospitals should be audited.andbullet; Hospitals and Hospital Complexes.Approximately 92 percent of total hospital insurance payments are paidto hospitals. Our review of these hospital payments indicates that amountspaid to non-PPS providers, in addition to the cost portion of paymentsto PPS providers, represent 30 percent of total payments to providers.In addition to auditing providers which are on a cost basis, it will stillbe necessary to expend a considerable amount of audit effort on PPS providersin order to verify the amount reimbursed on a cost basis, in addition toresponding to the special policy issues discussed earlier.The audit of PPS cost reports will be directed through the issuance ofPPS audit guidelines which are aimed at verification of core data, as wellas the verification of Medicare's proportionate share of pass-through items(e.g., capital, indirect and direct medical education costs and earliercosts) and the allocation of costs between hospital inpatient and outpatientdepartments. Since outpatient services and distinct part units continueto be reimbursed based on reasonable costs, there is a potential for costshifting to maximize Medicare reimbursement.Based on a review of the findings from completed audits of PPS cost reports,we have identified the most significant and recurring audit adjustmentsand designed audit strategies to identify the existence of each issue.These issues, which include but are not limited to the costs of excludedunits, capital related costs, medical education costs, and Medicare baddebt expense, have been incorporated into the guildelines developed specificallyfor PPS, and will be applied in all PPS audits.Of the Medicare-certified HHAs, approximately 38 percent receive 88.5 percentof Medicare reimbursement. Approximately 12 percent of the Medicare-certifiedSNFs receive 61.8 percent of the program reimbursement. By auditing costreports of 38 percent of the HHAs and 12 percent of the SNFs, we will bereviewing approximately $2.2. billion in benefit payments.There are other types of providers which receive reimbursement under theMedicare program. These providers include, but are not limited to, hospices,end stage renal disease (ESRD) facilities, rural health clinics, and ambulatorysurgical centers (ASCs). However, with the exception of ESRD facilities,the audit of these providers is prompted by legislative and/or policy considerations;therefore, audits of these providers are not included in the fiscal year'saudit plan on an ongoing basis. As necessary, hospices must be reviewedin order to fulfill our commitment to Congress to apprise them of hospiceoperating costs; ESRD facilities must be audited at least from an exceptionperspective; and ASCs must be audited to provide base-line data to updatethe payment rates, especially since these rates are the basis for payingfor various hospital outpatient surgical procedures.The following chart displays the methodology for funds distribution forFY 1989 audit effort by type of provider:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,b2,i1,s10,6,6,6</C><T4>Fiscal Year </T4>1989 <T4>Audit Effort by Type of Provider</T4><H1>Hospitals</H1><H1>Number of providers</H1><H1>Approximate percent to be audited</H1><H1>Number to be audited</H1><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>PPS</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total hospitals</ITAG><D>5,945</D><D>68</D><D>4,055</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="1">Multi-facility and part of chain<D>473</D><D>90</D><D>425</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other multi-facility hospitals<D>1,980</D><D>90</D><D>1,782</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other chain affiliated hospitals<D>1,027</D><D>60</D><D>616</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Remaining PPS hospitals<D>2,465</D><D>50</D><D>1,232</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>Non-PPS Hospitals</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total hospitals</ITAG><D>1,355</D><D>64</D><D>865</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="1">Chain affiliated<D>455</D><D>75</D><D>341</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Waiver State hospitals<D>152</D><D>50</D><D>76</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Remaining non-PPS hospitals<D>748</D><D>60</D><D>448</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total all hospitals</ITAG><D>7,300</D><D>67</D><D>4,920</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>Home Office Cost Reports</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total number of chains</ITAG><D>1,107</D><D>80</D><D>881</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="1">Chains with over 10 providers<D>146</D><D>90</D><D>131</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Governmentals<D>31</D><D>20</D><D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Proprietary<D>530</D><D>80</D><D>424</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-proprietary<D>400</D><D>80</D><D>320</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>HHAs</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Freestanding<D>4,640</D><D>38</D><D>1,763</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>SNFs</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Freestanding <D>6,218 </D><D>12 </D><D>746</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>Other</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">ESRD, RHC, CORF, etc<D>2,334</D><D>15</D><D>350</D><R>n,dandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D>21,599</D><D/><D>8,660</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">6. Provider Reimbursement (Part A Only)</ITAG>In FY 1989 we expect Medicare contractors to provide reimbursement servicesbased on 23,668 health care providers. This represents an increase of 9percent over the number of providers requiring reimbursement services inFY 1988. Reimbursement services are required for provider-based SNFs andHHAs in addition to ESRD facilities, Comprehensive Outpatient RehabilitationFacilities (CORFs) and hospices regardless of whether the provider is auditedon an annual or other basis. The budget provides for the following activities:andbullet; Collection of Provider Overpayments_A system must be maintainedto collect and record overpayments made to providers. In addition to collectionand recordkeeping activities, contractors will investigate and provideprofile data on uncollectible overpayment cases and provide monthly reportsto HCFA on the uncollectible accounts.andbullet; Interim Payments_Interim payments rates must be established andperiodically reviewed throughout the fiscal year for all Medicare providers.The interim rates process requires the review of provider cost and utilizationstatistics and the calculation of adjusted rates.andbullet; Consultative Services_Onsite assistance must be provided to anyprovider experiencing difficulties in preparing the cost report, preparingclaims or any other reimbursement area.andbullet; Records and Reports_According to specific instruction from HCFA,files and records must be established and maintained by the contractorsto ensure proper payments to providers. In addition, several differentprovider cost and payment reports must be prepared and submitted quarterlyto HCFA.In determining the amount of reimbursement funding each contractor receives,we analyze provider profiles submitted by contractors. The provider profilesshow types and numbers of PIP (periodic interim payment) and non-PIP providers.We review periods of reimbursent funding and assess the contractor's futureneeds based on projected provider workload and the availability of funds.We make every attempt to distribute funds in proportion to workload.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Productivity Investments</ITAG>The costs of implementing new initiatives designed to improve the effectivenessof Medicare program administration are referred to as productivity investments(PIs). Productivity investments generally provide start-up funds for contractoractivities. Once these projects are operational, funding for these projectsbecomes are operational, funding for these projects becomes part of thecontractor's ongoing costs. The criteria for selection of PIs to be implementedvary. For example, some PIs are required by legislation or regulatory requirements.We also obtain from various HCFA components projects expected to resultin improvements in administrative cost efficiency, for example, the CommonWorking File and Standard Systems.There is no single distribution methodology for the allocation of PI funds.After we determine the national cost of a PI, funds are divided among thecontractors based on either the contractors' cost estimates or throughHCFA derived formulas based on project specifications. For example, thecurrent notice of utilization (NOU) funding allocations were determinedby HCFA using the contractors' percentage of the national inpatient andskilled nursing facility claim workload. Other PI allocations such as beneficiary-orientedinitiatives, are divided equally among contractors. Finally, other PI's,such as the common working file and standard systems are given only tocontractors that are involved in the specific projects.In FY 1989, we propose to fund the following PIs: For Part A_common workingfile, contracting strategy, bundling of hospital services, Medicare benefitnotice, pacemaker registry, standard system; and for Part B_beneficiaryinitiatives, common working file, contracting strategy, bundling of physiciansservices, certified registered nurse anesthetist, physician identification,professional relations, standard system, and reconciliation provisions.Intermediaries and carriers have been advised of activities expected tobe carried on as part of these PIs.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Beneficiary/Physicians Inquiries</ITAG>The Medicare program is complex. It is based on many provisions requiredby law, regulations and policy dealing with entitlement, coverage of servicesand limitations on coverage, comprehensive payment rules, and the rightsand responsibilities of beneficiaries. Since contractors are the directlink between beneficiaries, physicians, and the program, this activityincludes all costs related to beneficiary and physician inquiries generatedby means of telephone calls, correspondence, and personal visits.From FY 1987 to FY 1988, the inquiries workload is expected to increaseby 13.8 percent. The first quarter data for FY 1988 show the level of inquiriesat 6.1 million which converts to 26.1 million inquiries annualized. Weestimate FY 1989 inquiries to increase by the weighted average of 11.7percent. Current contractor performance and evaluation criteria and standardsrequire that inquiries be processed within 30 calendar days. Although specificFY 1989 standards have not been determined, it is reasonable to assumethat standards requiring at least similar quantities of inquiries to beprocessed will apply.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Participating Physicians (Part B Only)</ITAG>Participating physicians are those who agree to accept assignment on allMedicare claims in return for certain incentives/benefits. All physiciansmust be given an opportunity to enroll/disenroll in the participation programannually.The participating physician program for carriers includes the followingactivities: MAAC (Maximum Allowable Actual Charge) monitoring; producingand distributing MEDPARD (Medicare Partipating Physician Director); monitoringnonparticipating physicians for compliance with section 9332(d) of OBRA1986; monitoring participating physicians; furnishing toll-free electronicmedia claims lines for participating physicians; responding to participationrelated inquiries from beneficiaries in a timely and responsive manner;participating physician and supplier enrollment; systems changes for pricingscreens and files related to the participating physician program; and datarequests (participation counts).Near the end of FY 1988, we will review data showing the actual numberof participating physicians in a carrier's service area, the percentageincrease in participating over FY 1987, and comparative data on participatingversus nonparticipating physicians. Based upon a carrier's overall successin increasing physician participation and the scope of work to be performedin FY 1989, we will fund this activity subject to the amount of availablefunding.When the Congress initially provided funding for the participation program,we identified each of the activities involved and priced each activitynationally. An algorithm was developed for distributing the funds to eachcontractor for each activity. Some algorithms distributed funds based onworkload and others based on the number of sites with systems changes.One activity was funded based on the participation rates. We then totaledthe cost of the various activities for each carrier and provided fundingaccordingly.<ITAG tagnum="81">Printing Claims Forms </ITAG>Although this activity is not among the seven contractor functional areas,it is a part of the national Medicare contractor budget. In the interestof maintaining standard formats and quality of Medicare entitlement andreport forms, intermediaries and carriers supply beneficiary enrollmentand provider cost reporting forms. The use of these forms is essentialto beneficiary notification, effective and efficient contractor operations,and other program purposes. With a steady increase in the number of beneficiaries and providers, weproject a corresponding increase in a substantial number of HCFA forms.An increase in the volume of forms equates to increased printing costsin FY 1989. b. Contractor Unit Cost Calculations A key step in the contractor budget process is the development of contractorunit costs for processing Part A bills and Part B claims. A factor in thedevelopment of contractor unit costs is a reduction of the unit cost basedupon the application of the cost efficiency benchmark (CEB). The CEB isone of the many adjustments used in determining the unit cost. Followingis a brief description of how we currently developed the CEB. The proceduremay change after we evaluate comments from the contractor community. We currently develop the CEB using competitive procurement price data.Competitive procurements provided us with a body of readily available datato begin development of the benchmarks. Although we have an establisheddata base, additional information can be added to the data base from alluseful sources (such as additional procurements, industrial engineeringstudies, demonstration projects, etc.) as it becomes available. The data base consists of price data from fixed-price contract competitionsand cost contract competitions (e.g., section 2326 selections under theDeficit Reduction Act (DEFRA)). Price information from any contract which became operational in FY 1984or later was included. Older contracts were excluded in that these priceswould have been bid 5 or more years ago and we believe the data no longerreflect current conditions. Fiscal year 1990 is currently the last yearin the data base in that it is the last year in which a completed contractsite will be operational. Included in the price data are implementation costs and any approved changeorder amounts to date. We excluded incentive payments and liquidated damagesbecause these are used as a performance tool and are not representativeof expenses associated with the actual delivery of services under the contracts.We adjusted historical data for inflation. We use the Gross National Product(GNP) implicit price deflator, in that it represents the broadest index.The GNP measure encompasses all goods and services produced, therefore,the implicit price deflator is more reflective of changes in overall productivityof the economy. Historical data through FY 1985 are expressed in 1986 dollars.Data for FY 1986 through FY 1990 reflect the actual numbers bid withoutadjustment. We compute a weighted average of all carrier data and one for all intermediarydata in the data base. This consisted of adding all claim or bill processingtotal price amounts (or blended amounts), adding all total workload volumes,and then dividing these overall totals to determine an average unit price.In addition to individual contractor target development, an additionalstep used in working through this concept to an end-product was to includethe impact of OBRA 86 in the overall CEBs. The resulting CEB is used in determining the unit cost as described insection III. C. under Bills Payment and Claims Payment below. <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Fiscal Year 1989 Medicare Contractor Budget Standards, Data,and Methodology </ITAG>After the President's FY 1989 Medicare contractor budget request was submittedto the Congress in February 1988, HCFA proceeded to develop budget guidelinesto be issued to the contractors. These guidelines outline the scope ofwork that intermediaries and carriers will be expected to perform duringthe upcoming fiscal year in each of the functional areas for which theyare responsible. In late May 1988, the budget guidelines were issued tothe regional offices which added information pertinent to intermediariesand carriers in their own region. These final individualized guidelineswill be sent to each intermediary and carrrier in early June to providethem with assistance in preparing their FY 1989 budget requests. Intermediariesand carriers must submit their budget requests to HCFA no later than sixweeks after the issuance of the budget guidelines. While intermediaries and carriers are preparing their budget requests,the program components within HCFA will develop preliminary budget allocationsfor the functional areas based upon historical patterns, workload growth/inflationassumptions and any other available information. Both central office andregional office staff will review intermediary and carrier budget requestsas they are submitted. Regional office staff will discuss the differencesbetween the intermediary and carrier requests and the HCFA derived allocationsand negotiate with each intermediary and carrier a final, mutually acceptablebudget within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. In September,the central office will prepare a Financial Operating Plan (FOP) for eachregional office providing total regional funding authority for each functionalarea. The regional offices in turn will prepare a Notice of Budget approval(NOBA) for each intermediary and carrier which provides a full year budgetplan subject to quarterly cash draw limitations.A. StandardsDuring FY 1989, the basic scope of work, along with new and special activities,which intermediaries and carriers will be expected to perform as describedin the budget guideline package, will be issued by the regional officesto each contractor in early June. Intermediaries and carriers will be expectedto perform the work as described in the budget guideline package and inaccordance with the standards included in the Contractor Performance EvaluationProgram (CPEP) for FY 1989. The CPEP requirements for FY 1989 was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 13, 1988 (53 FR 35378). For considerationin developing their initial budget requests, we will issue a draft copyof the CPEP standards to contractors in June.B. DataIn developing the individual intermediary and carrier budgets for FY 1989,we will utilize the following sourves of data which contain various workloadvolumes, functional costs and manpower information. The basic forms whichsupply the data that are utilized in developing intermediary and carrierbudgets are the HCFA-1523/1524 and the HCFA-1565/1566.Forms HCFA-1523/1524 (a multipurpose form which serves as the Budget Request,Notice of Budget Approval and Interim Expenditure Report); Forms HCFA-1523/1524ASchedule of Productivity Investments and Other; Forms HCFA-1523/1524B Scheduleof Credits, EDP and Overhead; Forms HCFA-1523/1524C Schedule of Appeals;Forms HCFA-1523/1524D Schedule of MSP Costs; Forms HCFA-1523/1524E Scheduleof MR/UR Costs; Forms HCFA-1525/1525A Contractor Audit Settlement Report(CASR); Schedules A, B, andamp; C; Audit Priority Matrix; Crossover fromCASR to Audit Priority Matrix; Provider Reimbursement Profile; Scheduleof Providers Serviced; MSP Savings Report; MR/UR Savings Report; Form HCFA-2580Cost Classification Report; Form HCFA-3259 Facilities and Occupancy Schedule;Forms HCFA-1565/1566 Carrier Performance Report/Monthly and IntermediaryWorkload Report; HCFA Actuary's Workload Estimates; EOMB's Economic Assumptionof 4.1 percent; Incremental Workload Efficiencies; Cost Efficiency Benchmarkreduction; Savings from Prior Productivity Investments; New LegislationCosts; Regional Office Recommendations; and Contract Provisions.C. MethodologyThe Medicare contractor budget is built around seven major functions performedby intermediaries for Part A and seven major functions performed by carriersfor Part B.The funcitional areas for Part A are: (1) Bills Payment; (2) Reconsiderationsand Hearings; (3) Medicare Secondary Payer; (4) Medical Review and UtilizationReview; (5) Provider Audit; (6) Provider Reimbursement; and (7) ProductivityInvestments.The functional areas for Part B are: (1) Claims Payment; (2) Reviews andHearings; (3) Beneficiary/Provider Inquiries; (4) Medical Review and UtilizationReview; (5) Medicare Secondary Payer; (6) Participating Physicians; and(7) Productivity Investments. The methodologies to be used in calculatingbudget allocations for these functional areas are discussed below. Wherea functional activity is common to both intermediaries and carriers, wehave combined the discussion.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Bills Payment and Claims Payment</ITAG>The individual intermediary and carrier workload levels for FY 1989 willbe calculated based upon the actual workload data reported through July1988 using the HCFA-1565/1566. We will project each intermediary/carrier'sbill/claim receipt level for FY 1989 using a statistical forecasting model.We will also project the number of bills/claims an intermediary and carrierexpects to have pending at the end of FY 1988 using the same data. We willthen combine the FY 1989 receipt estimate with the anticipated end of FY1988 pending level, and subtract the estimated FY 1989 pending for eachintermediary and carrier to establish a process workload (i.e., EstimatedFY 1989 receipts + Estimated end of FY 1988 pending ^ Estimated end ofFY 1989 pending pending=Estimated FY 1989 Processed Workload).In order to price individual contractor bill/claims workloads, we developa unit cost which is the cost of processing a single bill/claim. The individualintermediary and carrier unit costs for FY 1989 will be calculated basedupon unit costs (line 1 of the FY 1988 NOBA HCFA-1523/1524) in effect atthe time that we perform our computations. The calculations will includeincreases to recognize the cost of new legislation, the increased postagerate and 4.1 percent for price inflation. Reductions associated with theapplication of the Cost Efficiency Benchmark, incremental workload efficiencies,and savings achieved from prior Productivity Investments will also be partof the formula employed in computing FY 1989 target unit costs. The regionaloffices will negotiate with intermediaries and carriers to resolve anydifferences between the HCFA target unit cost and the contractors' requestedunit costs, within the limits of the funding available to HCFA.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Reconsiderations (Reviews Under Part B) and Hearings</ITAG>We will allocate funding based on the amount of dollars spent (line 2 ofthe NOBA HCFA-1523/1524C) in the prior year adjusted for inflation andvolume. Specifically, we will adjust the previous year's costs for reconsiderationsand hearings by the percentage change in inflation, which for FY 1989 isa 4.1 percent increase (a rate that reflects productivity gains generallyfor the economy, but which may cause over/understatement of costs dependingon the productivity efficiencies experienced by the individual contractors),and for the percentage change in workload. We have revised these formsto allow us to capture more discrete workload and cost data. We will usethese data to develop budgeted costs for reconsiderations and hearingsas we do for bills payment and claims payment costs, that is, forecastedprocessed volume times unit cost. The individual intermediary and carrierbudget allocations for reconsiderations, reviews, and hearings will bedetermined by using the old methodology. If sufficient reliable data arecollected, then we may redetermine the allocations by multiplying anticipatedworkload levels in FY 1989 times the newly developed unit cost. We willconsider the current pending backlog and projected receipts for each intermediaryand carrier. The regional offices will negotiate with intermediaries andcarriers to resolve any differences between the HCFA allocations and thecontractors' requests, within the limits of the funding available to HCFA.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Beneficiary/Provider Inquiries (Part B Only)</ITAG>The prior year's cost will be adjusted by the percentage change in inflationwhich for FY 1989 will be a 4.1 percent increase, as well as any projectedworkload increase or decrease to establish a budgeted amount for Beneficiaryand Provider Inquiries. We also consider special conditions unique to specificcarriers in negotiating the budget. We are now developing new reportingrequirements which will allow us to capture more discrete workload andcost data. We will begin the year using the old budgeting methodology untilwe have sufficient reliable data and then we may use these data to developa budgeted cost for beneficiary/provider inquiries by multiplying forecastedprocessed volume times unit cost. The regional offices will negotiate withthe carriers to resolve any differences between the HCFA allocations andcarriers' requests, within the limits of the funding available to HCFA.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Provider Reimbursement (Part A Only) </ITAG>In determining individual intermediary budgets for reimbursement activities,we will first calculate an FY 1988 unit cost using the funding includedon the latest FY 1988 NOBA (HCFA-1523/1524C) and dividing that amount ofmoney by the workload reported on the Schedule of Providers Serviced (SPS)for the same period. The SPS is a listing of all the facilities serviced by the intermediary.This report offers a more detailed description of the providers becauseit identifies them by type, by bed size, freestanding or provider-basedand whether they are paid on a periodic interim payment basis. The SPSis submitted with each initial budget request so that a part of the analysisis the comparision of the composition of the provider community servicedby the intermediary and any change reported between fiscal years. The unit cost found by dividing the amount of the FY 1989 NOBA by the workloadfrom the SPS for the same period forms the first of the ``raw'' data usedto project the 1989 budget. This unit cost will be increased by 4.1 percent,which is the rate of inflation provided to HCFA by EOMB. This adjusted unit cost is then multiplied by the FY 1989 workload as reportedon the SPS. The result will then be adjusted based on a review of cost documentationof special initiatives (e.g., the effect on intermediary reimbursementactivity of the transfer of the provider-based HHAs and hospices to theRegional Home Health Intermediaries). In order to resolve major differences between the intermediary's budgetrequest and the amount developed by the preceding approach, we analyzethe Reimbursement Profile which is an addendum to the Budget Request. Thisprofile shows the cost claimed by type of reimbursement activity (InterimRate Determinations, Overpayment Recoupment, Consulting services, etc.).The regional offices will negotiate with the intermediaries to resolveany differences between the HCFA allocations and the intermediaries' requests,within the limits of the funding available to HCFA. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Provider Audit (Part A Only) </ITAG>The provider audit function is divided into three major activities whichare desk reviews, settlements, and field audits. The basic report on which all audit analysis is based is the ContractorAuditing and Settlement Report (HCFA-1525/1525A). This form provides abreakout of audit activities and costs by type of provider as well as documentingthe savings incurred as a result of audit activity. Using this as a base,the desk review costs are developed by projecting the workload using thetotal count of providers serviced. (All cost reports must be desk reviewed.)The count of providers serviced is compared to the total shown on the Scheduleof Providers Serviced for verification. We then multiply this count bythe unit cost per desk review (developed from the latest CASR for FY 1988)to determine the cost of handling the FY 1989 workload at the 1988 unitcost. Settlement costs are based on the workload projected in the intermediary'sbudget request multiplied by the unit cost for settlements found in themost recent CASR for FY 1988. This will cost out the 1989 activity at the1988 level of expenditure. The only discretionary audit activity is the field audit. The intermediarybases its request for field audit funds on the pricing out of the fieldaudit activity outlined in the Budget Guidelines which establishes theparameters and provides direction for field auditing. The intermediarysupplies as documentation a CASR which breaks out the activities by typeof facility. An Audit Priority Matrix is also supplied which displays thefield audit activity in priority order. The Matrix serves initially asa planning document for the intermediary to determine how much activityand associated cost are required to respond to HCFA directives. Becausethe Matrix combines the cost of auditing a Multiple Facility provider asone cost report and the CASR breaks out these costs by type of component,we ask that the intermediary supply a crossover from the Matrix to theCASR so that the costs can be compared.The intermediaries' requests in total always exceed the amount of fundingavailable; therefore, it is this Matrix which HCFA must supply to determinehow to reduce the overall and individual audit requests commensurate withthe level of available funding. It is, however, the individual budget requestsof intermediaries for field audit activities which serve as the basis forbudgeting for this function, with adjustments based upon available fundingand audit priority.The overriding priority of all audit effort is comprised of the specialactivities required by legislation (COBRA, OBRA). The second priority isthat all cost reports must be desk reviewed, and, to the extent possible,settled. Therefore, any reductions to budget requests must be made in fieldaudit. The careful analysis of the Matrix allows us to determine what adjustmentsto audit activity can be made to reduce the audit spending while stillmaintaining a high exposure to the field audit activity.All of the above costs are adjusted for inflation which for FY 1989 willbe a 4.1 percent increase.The regional offices will negotiate with intermediaries to resolve anydifferences between the HCFA allocations and the intermediaries' requests,within the limits of the funding available to HCFA.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP)</ITAG>We will extract data, including processed volumes, costs and program savings,from the HCFA-1523/1524D and the MSP Savings Report to determine MSP fundingallocations. In allocating the FY 1989 MSP budget to individual intermediariesand carriers, we consider: (1) Estimated potential savings goals by categoryand by State (e.g., working aged and spousal working aged insurance, automobile,medical liability and no-fault insurance, end stage renal disease, disabilityand workers compensation); (2) the relationship of available funds to expectedsavings among contractors; and (3) staffing mix differences, levels ofsystems sophistication and special tasks (e.g., regional data exchange).The regional offices will consider 1, 2, and 3 of this section when negotiatingwith intermediaries and carriers within the limits of the funding availableto HCFA.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Medical Review/Utilization Review (MR/UR)</ITAG>The individual intermediary and carrier MR/UR budgets for FY 1989 willbe calculated in three components: prepayment medical review, postpaymentactivities, and medical review policy development (carriers only). As apart of the budget guidelines, we ask intermediaries and carriers via theHCFA-1523/1524E Schedule of MR/UR Costs, to estimate: (1) The number ofbills/claims to be processed by bill types, (2) the required funding, (3)percent of full-time equivalents, and (4) the percent of electronic dataprocessing costs attributable to MR/UR review. We will allocate to eachcontractor prepayment and postpayment medical review funding based uponthe requested workload which an intermediary or carrier projects will beprocessed under the FY 1989 budget guidelines for medical review and thefunds requested by the intermediary or carrier to perform the reviews.Carrier budgets for medical review policy development will be based onlevels of sophistication of carrier policy development and disseminationand the need for medical direction. The funding calculations for all MR/URactivities will include a 4.1 percent factor for price inflation whereapplicable. The regional offices will negotiate with intermediaries andcarriers to resolve any differences between the HCFA allocations and thecontractors' requests, within the limits of the funding available to HCFA.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Participating Physicians (Part B Only)</ITAG>In determining the individual carrier funding levels for the participatingphysician program for FY 1989, we will consider the following factors basedon carrier data to be published at a later date: The number of physiciansin the carrier's service area; the carrier's current participation rate;the carrier's recent performance in increasing its participation rate;the scope of work to be performed as outlined in the budget guidelines;and last year's cost experience. Since participating physicians are eligiblefor free EMC lines for billing, allowance will be made for these expenses.Carriers with lower participation rates will receive greater funding forMAAC violation monitoring and monitoring of nonparticipating physiciansfor compliance with elective surgery disclosure requirements. Carrier monitoringfunds will be allocated based on the national percentage of nonparticipatingphysicians. Funding for carrier incentive bonuses will be based on theallocation methodology which will be described in a separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> document. All carriers will receive the samefunding amount for reporting participation statistics. Our computationsof the carriers' budgets for these activities will include an allowancefor price inflation. The regional offices will negotiate with the carriersto resolve any differences between the HCFA allocations and the carriers'requests, within the limits of the funding available to HCFA.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Productivity Investments</ITAG>The costs of implementing legislation and new initiatives designed to improvethe effectiveness and efficiency of Medicare program administration arereferred to as Productivity Investments. Several allocation methodologieswill be employed in calculating the Productivity Investment budgets forindividual intermediaries and carriers. For those projects involving onlysingle contractors or small groups of contractors, we will allocate fundsbased upon the specifications of the particular project. For those projectsinvolving all intermediaries and/or carriers in which the costs are drivenby bill/claims volume, we will distribute the funding based upon our workloadprojections for each contractor. Finally, for those projects involvingall intermediaries and/or carriers which require equal effort regardlessof the contractor's size, we will derive a standard allocation to be givento all contractors. The regional offices will negotiate with the intermediariesand carriers to resolve any differences between the HCFA allocations andthe contractors' requests, within the limits of the funding available toHCFA.The sum of the preceding functions, in addition to printing costs, becomesthe FY 1989 national Medicare contractor budget. HCFA distributes the fundingto intermediaries and carriers in accordance with the established guidelinesand allocations as previously discussed. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Impact Statement </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires us to prepare and publish an initialregulatory impact analysis for any proposed notice that meets one of theE.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to resultin: an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.The purpose of this notice is to fulfill our obligation under section 4035(a)of Pub. L. 100-203 to inform the public of our proposed budgeting methodology,the data used in the budgeting process, and the standards we expect ourcontractors to achieve; and to permit the public the opportunity to commenton our proposal. As a purely informational document, this notice wouldnot promulgate any rule or implement any policy. Nor would this noticebe a part of, or substitute for, any negotiations we intend to conductwith the intermediaries and carriers. Although the outcome of our negotiationsare expected to have beneficial effects on contractor operations and onthe program (as described in section II. above), such effects would bethe result of these negotiations rather than as a result of this notice.Thus, this document, by itself, would not produce an impact either on contractoroperations or on program activities. For these reasons (that is, this notice does not represent an attempt atrulemaking, and the publishing of this notice would have no impact on anyaspect of the Medicare program), we believe that the Executive Order doesnot apply to this notice. Therefore, we have not prepared a regulatoryimpact analysis. B. The Regulatory Flexibility Act We generally prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis that isconsistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through612), unless the Administrator certifies that a proposed notice such asthis would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. For purposes of the RFA, fiscal intermediaries and carriersare not small entities, although we treat all providers and suppliers assmall entities. As explained in the discussion of E.O. 12291 above, this notice does notrepresent a rulemaking effort or an attempt to implement any policy withregard to contractors, beneficiaries, providers or suppliers. This noticeis intended only to provide information about our proposed budgeting methodology,the data we intend to utilize in the budgeting process, and the standardswe are proposing for contractors to achieve. Also, because this documentis of a purely informational nature, there would be no impact on any componentof the Medicare program as a result of the publication of this notice.For these reasons, we have determined, and the Administrator certifiesthat this proposed notice would not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Therefore, we have not prepared a regulatoryflexibility analysis that conforms to the RFA. C. Impact on Small Rural Hospitals Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare an initialregulatory impact analysis for any proposed notice such as this that mayhave a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number ofsmall rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisionsof section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act,we define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 50 bedslocated outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area or a New England CountyMetropolitan Area. Since, as previously explained, this notice merely announces the proposedbudgetary basis for our negotiations with fiscal intermediaries and carriers,and does not constitute a rulemaking effort or have an effect of its own,we have determined, and the Administrator certifies that this notice wouldnot have a significant effect on the operations of a substantial numberof small rural hospitals. Therefore, we have not prepared a regulatoryimpact analysis on small rural hospitals. D. Paperwork Reduction Act This notice contains no information collection requirements subject toEOMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et. seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">V.
