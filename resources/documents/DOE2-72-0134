The parameters assessed are multipliedto determine the absolute electric power consumption. Expected technicaldevelopments and production outputs are taken into account consideringcurrent quality-before-quantity trends which show that better qualitiesdo not necessarily imply a proportional increase in quantities and electricpower consumption. The analysis refers to industry as a whole and allowsto derive individual industrial trends from the data characterizing individualdecisions on the part of the electric power industry. The data are verifiedaccording to the specific conditions of the respective supply areas.</TEXT></DOC>
