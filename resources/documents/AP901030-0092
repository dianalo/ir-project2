Five Hinduswere killed and 20 wounded.   At least 26 people were killed in other parts of India as thedecades-old dispute between Hindus and Moslems over ownership ofthe site came to a head.   The controversy has left at least 138 people dead in the pastweek, brought Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government close tocollapse and further strained already tense relations betweenIndia's Hindu majority and Moslem minority.</TEXT><HEAD>Singh, who opposes the Hindu campaign to replace the 16th-century</HEAD><TEXT>   Moslem mosque, on Tuesday repeated his offer to resign if his partythought it would help contain the sectarian violence. He made asimilar offer Monday.   Hindu fundamentalists had said they would start constructionTuesday on a temple to the god Rama on the site occupied by themosque. The government said it would block any attempt to destroythe small, one-story shrine and arrested 90,000 supporters of thefundamentalist World Hindu Council in the past week.   On Tuesday, 10,000 Hindus stormed police barricades outside thedisputed shrine. Police first used tear gas and bamboo canes tobeat back the crowd.   Then, after several hours of clashes as the crowds pushed closerand closer to the mosque, the police fired rifles.   Reporters saw four bodies, but a government spokesman in NewDelhi later said five people were killed. Witnesses said at least20 people were wounded.   S.K. Gupta, a doctor at a local hospital, said 13 of the injuredwere in serious condition. ``They have only 10 percent chances ofsurvival,'' he said.   Thousands of young men wearing orange headbands, the color ofthe Hind faith, broke through successive police cordons, enteredthe small mosque, pried bricks from the wall and chipped bits ofplaster from its three domes. They planted an orange flag on eachdome before police chased them away.   Many Hindus said they were helped by policemen guarding themosque, which the fundamentalists say stands on the spot where Ramawas born. Most of the 20,000 policemen on duty in Ayodhya areHindus.   While the crowds rushed toward the mosque, Hindu holy menscreamed obscenities from rooftops and pelted police with stones.At least four policemen were injured.   As news spread that the police barricades had been breached,hundreds of Hindus poured into the streets of Ayodhya in defianceof the 4-day-old curfew that had confined them to their homes. Manydistributed candy and exploded firecrackers to shouts of ``Jai siyaRama!'' - ``Victory to Rama!''   Many policemen were seen entering the disputed shrine to pray.   The World Hindu Council said its success in penetrating policelines meant the temple project had begun.   ``In my 19 years of service, I have never experienced such asense of failure,'' a senior government official at the site saidon condition of anonymity. ``It was a collapse of theadministration.''   Later, paramilitary troops cleared the shrine of intruders andthreatened to open fire if any further attempts were made to breachthe barricades.   The government's chief spokesman, Ramamohan Rao, said the mosquewas not seriously damaged. He spoke in New Delhi, 300 milesnorthwest of Ayodhya.   In several towns hundreds of miles from Ayodhya, Hindus andMoslems fought street battles and police opened fire on riotingmobs. In those incidents, 25 were killed in street battles and thepolice firing, while one Hindu committed suicide in protest.   The army was called out in two towns in the western state ofGujarat. Police in New Delhi said the situation in the capital wastense and troops were alert for trouble.   Prime Minister Singh's government lost its patchwork majority inParliament last week after The Hindu Bharatiya Janata Partywithdrew support over the government's stand on the Ayodhyadispute.   On Tuesday, Singh offered to resign if his party felt ``thatchange of leadership will serve larger goals.''   ``What is closest to my heart is that at this juncture thecountry be saved from communal flames,'' Singh said in a letter tohis Janata Dal party president, Somappa Rayappa Bommai.   Singh is scheduled to face a vote of confidence Nov. 7.Bharatiya Janata has said it will oppose Singh's continuing inoffice.   The Congress Party of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, thelargest group in Parliament, has made a similar announcement. TheCongress and Bharatiya Janata together hold 281 seats - a majorityin the 522-member Parliament.   Bharatiya Janata says Singh's policy on the dispute is aimed atgarnering Moslem votes. The Congress accused him of faultyadministration that brought the Hindu-Moslem dispute to a boil.   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people.Athough India is constitutionally a secular nation, Hindus comprise82 percent of the population and have always held the primeminister's post.   At least 900 people were killed in Hindu-Moslem violence lastyear after the Hindu group announced plans to replace the mosquewith a temple.</TEXT></DOC>
