Bush also scorned presidential rival Michael Dukakis anew Mondayas a liberal Democrat and ``a card-carrying member'' of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union.   Speaking to a crowd of several thousand people at a shoppingcenter rally in Alton, Ill., Bush referred to a recent charge byDukakis that Bush had engaged in McCarthyism, a reference to thevigilante tactics of the late Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy.   ``Recently, the governor of Massachusetts accused me ofMcCarthyism,'' Bush said. ``And it was suggested that when I saidhe is a card-carrying member of the ACLU that that was McCarthyism;when I say he's a liberal, that it's unfair.   ``No, he's that. He says's he's that. He's that.''   Bush made no mention at the rally that five more members of anethnic coalition supporting his campaign had resigned under fire.   The vice president's ``Coalition of American Nationalities,''lost five of its members when they resigned Monday in the wake ofcharges of anti-Semitism and Holocaust revisionism among some ofits officials.   The controversy arose after Washington Jewish Week reported thatsome of the five had ties to anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi movements andapparent neo-fascist associations.   The resignations came one day after Frederic Malek, a Bushappointee to the Republican National Committee, stepped down aftera published report said he tallied the number of Jewish employeesat the Bureau of Labor Statistics while serving in the Nixonadministration.   The most recent poll, meanwhile, puts Dukakis and Bush in avirtual dead heat among registered voters. The CNN-USA Today pollreleased Monday night indicates that 48 percent favor Bush to 46percent for Dukakis.   The survey of 1,260 certain voters last week by the Gordon BlackCorporation had a three-point margin of error.   Dukakis, launching a three-day counteroffensive againstRepublican charges he would cripple American defense and foreignpolicy, told 200 supporters at a union hall in Philadelphia thatBush was ``disastrously and completely and unforgivably wrong'' fornot warning President Reagan against selling arms to Iran in anattempt to free hostages.   Later, Dukakis ran into some boos when he visited a GE plant inEvendale, Ohio, that makes engines for the Stealth bomber. He told1,000 workers that work on the radar-evading aircraft began under aDemocratic administration and ``it's going to be completed in myadministration, you can count on it.''   But some workers booed and chanted ``Bush, Bush.'' One signread, ``Keep your job, vote for Bush.''   Dukakis' unqualified statement of support for the Stealth bomberappeared to go beyond earlier campaign statements that he supportedcontinued research on the project. Dukakis issues adviser JamesSteinberg said Dukakis was committed to deployment of the aircraftprovided ``it is affordable and it works,'' and said thatrepresents no change in position.   Dukakis said he would restore respect for America, which he saidhad been undermined by Reagan-Bush failures to combat terrorism,come to grips with the trade deficit and stop ``the avalanche ofdrugs ... pouring across our borders.''   ``I want to beat our foreign competitors; he's willing to settlefor second best. I want to crack down on terrorism; he knuckledunder to the ayatollah. I want a real war on drugs; his answer todrug kingpins like (Panama leader Manuel) Noriega is J. DanforthQuayle,'' Dukakis said.   Bush, at a news conference in Washington and later at a rallybefore 1,000 flag-waving Cuban-Americans in Union City, N.J.,cudgeled Dukakis on defense and foreign affairs as well as theeconomy.   ``I will really admit that I am having trouble pinning down theliberal governor of Massachusetts on his defense,'' Bush said inNew Jersey.   Bush demanded that Dukakis spell out whether he supported the1986 U.S. bombing raid on Libya and the 1983 invasion ``to freeGrenada from its Cuban masters.''   If the answer is no, he said, Dukakis would show himself to have``veered outside the bipartisan mainstream'' on national securityissues. He also asked whether Dukakis would admit ``that yoursupport for a nuclear freeze was a mistake.''   Dukakis had his own questions for Bush, ranging from theIran-Contra affair to why the Reagan administration cut funds forthe Coast Guard and aid for state and local drug agencies while itput ``General Noriega on its payroll.'' Noriega is under indictmenton drug trafficking charges.   ``What kind of judgment is this?'' Dukakis asked. ``What kind ofpriorities are these? ... We need better leadership from the nextpresident.''   Earlier Monday, Bush named a panel of national security advisersincluding former Secretaries of State Henry A. Kissinger andAlexander M. Haig as well as Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was DemocratJimmy Carter's national security adviser.   Introducing Brzezinski, Bush said his objective was ``to shape aforeign policy built on the principles of bipartisanship ...realism, strength, dialogue and engagement.''   Brzezinski said Bush ``has been tested in the internationalarena and he has a wide-ranging grasp of international realities.He's not a novice in that critical area of foreign policy on whichour national survival depends.''   Dukakis has opposed the MX and Midgetman missiles and has calledthe Strategic Defense Initiative a fantasy, although he emphasizedlast week he would continue basic SDI research at a reduced level.   Bush's running mate, Quayle, touring a plant and addresing aRotary Club in Kalamazoo, Mich., said that if Dukakis wins, ``hishand'll be back in your pocket'' and the Democrats will ``return usonce again to those chilling days of no growth'' under Carter.   His counterpart, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, spent the day inWashington attending to Senate duties.</TEXT></DOC>
