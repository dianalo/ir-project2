You're too damn greedy,&quot; she complained. A minute later, she was gone.    For the venture capitalist, Kenneth Moch, such encounters are common these days. As managing partner of Catalyst Ventures, a Baltimore venture-capital fund founded seven months ago, he has met with nearly 250 entrepreneurs this year. Yet he hasn't made a single investment.    Entrepreneurs often gripe that squeezing money out of venture capitalists is one of their biggest headaches. But the 35-year-old Mr. Moch, a former entrepreneur himself, is fast discovering that passing out the money is no piece of cake either.    Mr. Moch's Catalyst Ventures is one of a growing number of small venture-capital funds that focus on financing very small, young companies in a given area or industry -- in this case, the Baltimore-Washington region. Financed by several companies and the Abell Foundation in Baltimore, Catalyst has $12.3 million to invest. It also plans to share research and possibly co-invest with two larger Baltimore venture-capital funds, New Enterprise Associates and ABS Ventures.    But so far, the going has been slow. One big obstacle: The capital in venture funds -- over $31 billion nationally -- has doubled in the past four years. Thus, cash available greatly overshadows obviously attractive investment opportunities.    Moreover, Catalyst is operating in an area without the entrepreneurial tradition of Silicon Valley or Route 128. So, although Mr. Moch hears from many people with promising technologies or business ideas, they often don't have a lot of business experience. And providing seed funding is always more chancy than investing in the later stages of a company.    Still, by year's end, Mr. Moch hopes to make a dozen or so investments. Of the proposals he has seen so far, he rates about a half-dozen as promising. He says he is currently discussing the terms under which he will invest in these start-ups. Also, he has identified two promising areas in pharmaceuticals. Last month, Catalyst invested $20,000 in two technical teams to evaluate the potential of these fields.    A look at a recent day in Mr. Moch's life sheds light on how venture capitalists work -- and why they reject so many &quot;sure-fire&quot; proposals from entrepreneurs:    The day begins in the basement of Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital. Amid a battery of X-ray machines and high-tech scanners, radiologist Elliot Fishman is working on a three-dimensional imaging system to let doctors analyze fractures and bone damage in greater depth.    Mr. Moch comments on the improvements made in the system since he met with Dr. Fishman about six weeks earlier. And he is excited when Dr. Fishman says a major medical company is interested in marketing the system. But Mr. Moch frets that the system's $125,000 price tag will put it beyond reach of many potential buyers. Besides, he doesn't think it is simple enough to be used by doctors with little time and patience.    &quot;The design needs more refinement,&quot; Mr. Moch says. He plans to talk to Dr. Fishman again after he has interviewed some potential users and the medical company interested in the product.    Even when venture capitalists like an idea, they have to worry about obstacles that could prove decisive, such as the time it will take to develop a finished product. For instance, in his next appointment back at Catalyst's small brownstone office, Mr. Moch meets with an Israeli-born software designer who desperately needs $1 million to keep alive his project: a software system to aid managers in advanced decision-making. Mr. Moch, a Stanford M.B.A. who was an executive at a biotechnology start-up for almost six years, attends the meeting with a New Enterprise venture capitalist, a former computer industry analyst.    Until now, the venture has been a bootstrap operation, financed by the programmer and his family. But it is rapidly exhausting his resources -- at about $35,000 a month. Without new money, the project will have to be halted, the scientist says.    Both Mr. Moch and the analyst feel that the entrepreneur's software fills an important niche. But they worry that it may take a year or more to complete development of the product and that managers may find it hard to use. &quot;Ease of use determines who will use the product and how much it can sell for,&quot; says Mr. Moch. Another area of concern: The company needs much help with business planning and marketing.    Over a working lunch, Mr. Moch next meets two corporate refugees: former employees of Comsat Corp. who have a product to connect remote networks of Macintosh computers. The two already have spent their own savings to design and test the product. Now they need money for full-scale production and marketing.    The entrepreneurs, both scientists, clearly know more about the product and the business than about marketing. Mr. Moch worries that the Macintosh market isn't large enough to support a big company. He also is concerned about competitors. Do the entrepreneurs have plans for a broader-based company? And what about the competition? Why can't Apple create a similar product? Mr. Moch decides to talk to telecommunications analysts and explore the broader market.    Though venture capitalists reject one project after another, sometimes they reconsider. After lunch, Mr. Moch meets with Lee Feldman, an entrepreneur who wants to raise $12 million for his venture: a company that will use sophisticated software for medical diagnostics.    Mr. Moch already had sent the entrepreneur a polite rejection. He wanted too much money for a market that hadn't been properly identified yet, Mr. Moch explains. But then, on the recommendation of a New York venture capitalist, Mr. Moch decided to see the entrepreneur.    Mr. Feldman, after working as a scientist on many research projects, says he now wants to apply his technology to business. Though he doesn't have a ready product or a blueprint, he has talked to a big computer company about using the technology on the company's system. Moreover, he is sure he can sell the software to big health insurers and corporations.    Mr. Moch likes the idea but feels that much development work is needed to create a prototype. Besides, Mr. Feldman has no business experience to help launch a start-up. Mr. Moch decides to consult the colleague who referred Mr. Feldman before making a decision.    The last meeting is with a scientist seeking $1 million to develop a new and more efficient way to produce an existing drug. The resulting product not only would have new applications but would be far superior to the existing drug, she claims.    For Mr. Moch, the market the scientist describes is too vague and undefined. Moreover, he worries that the product has no proprietary value and that others can easily copy it. His biggest concern, however, is that the potential size of the company is too small to be a profitable investment. &quot;This isn't a project for a venture capitalist. You need to work with a corporate partner,&quot; he tells the scientist.    She replies: &quot;I will never work with a corporation.&quot; Mr. Moch then explains that he expects returns of five to 10 times his investments over a five-year to 10-year period. And he fears that the company she is planning won't fit the bill. That's when the entrepreneur walks out.    Mr. Moch says he will write a letter thanking her for the visit. But by day's end, the venture capitalist is essentially where he started: many avenues to explore -- but no investments to make. </TEXT></DOC>
