Answering questions in the Kuwaiti newspaper al-Anbaa, Khalilal-Wazir was quoted as saying the four-month-old confrontation inthe Israeli-occupied territories was moving into a second stageinvolving increased use of military force.   Seven masked commandos burst into the Khalil's home in suburbanTunis, Tunisia, early Saturday and opened fire with submachineguns, killing him, two bodyguards and a gardener.   Al-Wazir, 52, also called Abu Jihad, was the most seniorPalestine Liberation Organization official assassinated sinceFatah, the largest guerrilla group in the PLO, was founded in 1964.He was PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's closest aide, led the group'smain army, and supervised military operations inside theIsraeli-occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.   News reports have linked Israel to the killings, but the }nmenthas refused to comment on them.   In Sunday's interview, al-Wazir said the next stage of theuprising ``involves commando operations against select Israelimilitary targets.''   ``These operations will shore up the morale of our people in theoccupied territories, because such operations will be directedagainst those who act as tools of extremely brutal oppression,beatings and bone-breakings,'' he said.   Al-Wazir's assassination unleashed a new spate of rioting in theoccupied territories, causing more than a dozen deaths.   In the interview, al-Wazir said new operations would includebuilding up the uprising's own military organization anddistribution of such weapons as Molotov bombs, flame and leadballs, and arrows.   He also talked of stepped-up use of guerrilla raids outside theoccupied territories.   Israeli experts say al-Wazir was responsible for a list ofbloody attacks, such as the 1975 takeover of the Savoy Hotel in TelAviv in which 11 hostages were slain and a March 1978 bus hijackingin which 33 Israelis were killed and 82 wounded.   In the uprising against Israeli occupation, Palestinians so farhave fought the heavily armed Israeli security forces mainly withstones. PLO officials were reported to order them to avoid guns tohelp gain international sympathy.   In his interview, al-Wazir said the Palestinian uprising ``willcontinue until the Palestinian flag is hoisted in the heart ofJerusalem as the capital of the independent Palestinian state.''   Israel considers Jersualem its capital.</TEXT></DOC>
