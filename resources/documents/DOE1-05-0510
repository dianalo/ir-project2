The results of which were compared with thoseby bronchography and bronchofiberscopy. Using bronchofiberscopic findingsas bases tomographic findings were found not always to agree with them.The ratio and percentage of abnormal findings by tomography to thoseby bronchofiberscopy were as follows: 34/38 on tumor (89.5 %), 100/117on stenosis (85.5 %), 12/12 on obstruction (100 %), and 102/120 (85.0%) on irregularity of bronchial wall. In conclusion, the brilliant visualizationof the trachea, main bronchus and lobar bronchus by this method was ofgreat diagnostic significance. The convenience of tomography with a compensationfilter is the same as that of the conventional tomography, because afilter may only be attached to the front of multiple diaphragm withoutany physical burden on patients. This tomography may be of value as aroutine X-ray diagnosis of the chest.</TEXT></DOC>
