This lobby has emergedclearly as the No. 1 adversary of the American taxpayer.   Nowhere is this more clear than in California. Thanks to a1988 ballot-initiative, the state constitution now sets asidebetter than 40% of tax dollars for the schools. Each year'sexpenditures become a formal base for the following year'sincrease. This is mostly regardless of fiscal emergencies oreconomic hardship. Result: As California schools get moremoney per pupil than ever and as its teachers rank behindonly Alaska's in pay, other programs (and taxpayers) getsqueezed.</LP><TEXT>   Gov. George Deukmejian has battled the education carteland its leader, State Superintendent Bill Honig, for nearlyeight years. In signing his last budget as chief executive,Mr. Deukmejian did what he could, blue-penciling millions ofdollars from Mr. Honig's departmental budget. The schoolmanis pushing to override the line-item vetoes.   Public education's managers have had a good political rideof it. Despite increased difficulty in recent decades ingetting local school-tax measures passed, they have foundstatewide elections more to their liking. As with the 1988item in California, the costs can be better hidden or shiftedonto somebody else. Arizona and Nevada have such measures onthe ballot this November. It took a determined MichiganChamber of Commerce to defeat special school taxes there lastyear.   Washington state may be headed for a similar vote.Teachers there last month picketed the governor, wanting araise in their average $33,000 nine-month pay instead of theperformance-based compensation he favors. The head of thestate teachers' union suggested curbing business-taxdeductions to spring for the boost.   Sustained teacher walkouts, such as in West Virginia andOklahoma the past year, achieved their aim. And with teachersalaries having declined to about 40% of U.S. schooloperating budgets, griping about central-office bureaucracysurely is merited.   The truth always is that some teachers aren't paid nearlyenough, whereas others are overpaid with their first dollar.Parental-choice mechanisms help to distinguish between them,and between administrators. But unions preferacross-the-board raises. And state legislatures can be softtouches for the schools, because Republicans frommiddle-class districts are as eager to wangle funds as theDemocrats from central cities, whose classrooms are allowedto get worse no matter how much is spent. (The bout ofredistributionist &quot;equalization&quot; now gripping New Jersey isthe latest of such court-aided efforts to make dollar signsthe focal point of saving schools in poorer areas.)   The National Education Association, the big teachers'union, last month asked for a $2.2 billion Operation JumpStart program by which a third of the country'selementary-grade students would begin their school terms twoweeks early to play catch up. Somehow this is supposed tocompensate for the lapses in instruction and parenting fromwhich they suffer the rest of the year. The NEA also said thepublic schools should be the primary provider of day care,meals and health-screening for preschool, kindergarten andelementary pupils. Potty training, too, probably, as theteachers' unions strive for more market share of availabletax dollars at all levels of government.   It's not all offense for the school spenders these days.Increasingly, as in California, they must defend their takeagainst those who would limit the public sector. In Oregon, afirefight has broken out over a property-tax limit to bedecided in November. (The state branch of the NEA isespecially besieged because an educationalchoice measure ison the same ballot.) Around the country in this active yearof citizen tax resistance, it's the same thing. John Keast,who tracks such matters for the Free Congress Foundation,reports that in every state considering a spending or taxlimit, the school lobby is the primary foe of these controlefforts.   True enough, schools have had more burdens imposed on themby a deterioration in home life, and some of them (includingthose in Mr. Honig's California, to be fair) have managed toraise test scores in the past few years. Overall, however,the nation has paid dearly only to remain at risk ofeducational implosion. Money won't help without some kind ofmarket to allocate it, without more competition to weed outfailed administrators and teachers, and without moreaccountability to the people who have to pay the taxes.</TEXT></DOC>
