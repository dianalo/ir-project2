Positionalisotope exchange from the {beta}-{gamma} bridge to the {beta} nonbridgeposition of [{gamma}-{sup 18}O]GTP was followed using {sup 31}P NMR.The positional isotope exchange was found to occur in the presence ofeither IMP or IMP and succinate. The exchange did not occur in the presenceof asparate. These results support a reaction mechanism which involvesformation of a 6-phosphoryl-IMP intermediate with subsequent attack byaspartate to form adenylosuccinate as originally proposed by Liebermanin 1956. In order to resolve the NMR resonances for positional isotopeexchange, it was necessary to find a chelator which would limit exchangebroadening. trans-1,2-Diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid wasfound to be a suitable chelator at neutral and acidic pH. Studies ofadenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli have been limited bythe low concentrations of enzyme present in the cell and the difficultyin purifying the enzyme to homogeneity. Overproduction of the enzymeby cloning the purA gene into a runaway replication plasmid allowed thecells to produce a much higher concentration of enzyme. A new purificationscheme is reported that takes advantage of the overproduced enzyme. Yieldsof 75 mg of homogeneous enzyme have been obtained from 76 g of E. colicell paste.</TEXT></DOC>
