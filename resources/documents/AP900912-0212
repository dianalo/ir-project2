The lastthing we want to do is walk away.''   The union has a $40 million strike fund to support a longstrike, White said.   Company spokesman Jim Hartford declined to provide details ofthe offer, but said it covered ``economic elements'' such as wages,vacations and cost-of-living allowances.   ``We believe it can form the basis of a settlement,'' Hartfordsaid Wednesday morning.   The talks began Aug. 5 after the union picked Ford as its striketarget. Any contract reached will serve as the model for latertalks with the Canadian divisions of General Motors and Chrysler.   The union has not said how much of a raise it wants. Fordworkers now earn a base rate of $17.83 an hour.   Union negotiators are also demanding more time off for workersand increased job security.
