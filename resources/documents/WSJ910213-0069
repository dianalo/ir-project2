The guidelines, issued yesterday as a presidentialdirective, are the result of a nine-month review headed byVice President Dan Quayle and the National Space Council. Theguidelines are intended to encourage private companies tobecome more active in space-related goods and services,especially in five areas identified as offering potential fordevelopment: satellite communications, space transportation,such as rockets, remote sensing equipment and the datagenerated from such equipment, the processing of materialsfrom space, and support facilities and services.</LP><TEXT>   The guidelines don't require review by Congress and don'thave the force of law. But space specialists said theguidelines could be a catalyst for companies that have longcomplained that they have been held back by uncertainty aboutthe government's commitment to a private-sector role in thedevelopment of space.   Under the guidelines, government agencies are expected touse commercially available space products and services &quot;tothe fullest extent feasible&quot; as long as the products meet thegovernment's requirements &quot;in a cost-effective manner,&quot;according to a statement by White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater.   Agencies are also expected to promote the transfer ofunclassified technology developed by the U.S. government &quot;inas timely a manner as possible and in ways that protect itscommercial value,&quot; the guidelines said.   Among other guidelines issued yesterday, federal agencies:   -- May undertake cooperative research and development withthe private sector or state and local governments.   -- May, if new technology is generated in the course of agovernment contract, retain only rights necessary to meetgovernment needs and mission requirements.   -- Should avoid regulating domestic space activities &quot;in amanner that precludes or deters commercial private sectoractivities, consistent with national security and domesticlegal requirements.&quot;   -- May make unused or excess space assets and servicesavailable for commercial use.   -- Should work to establish an international tradingenvironment that encourages market-oriented competition.   The White House statement said the guidelines are meant toprovide companies with &quot;a level of stability andpredictability&quot; in dealing with the government.   Prof. John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Instituteat George Washington University here said the document clearsthe way &quot;for a market test.&quot;   &quot;The rhetoric says there is a latent commercial spaceindustry that has been discouraged by the uncertainty ofgovernment policy, and now government policy is clearlystated,&quot; he said. &quot;Now it's up to the private sector to seewhether in fact there are space ventures that are appropriatefor risky investment.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
