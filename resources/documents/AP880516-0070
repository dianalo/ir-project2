Fighting occurred at Korea and Sungkyunkwan universities indifferent parts of Seoul after police fired tear gas to stop 1,200students marching into the streets to honor the death of ChoSung-man, 24.   ``Down with the military dictatorship,'' students screamed asthey pelted riot police with firebombs that exploded in sheets offlaming gasoline. No serious injuries were reported.   At least 3,000 students and dissidents staged peaceful protestsat other colleges and at Myongdong Cathedral, where Cho stabbedhimself in the stomach Sunday before jumping from the top of athree-story building.   Hundreds of mourners, some of them weeping, lit incense or leftwhite and yellow flowers at a makeshift altar outside thecathedral. Students marched around the cathedral compound shoutingslogans and speakers urged passersby to fight the government.   ``Free all prisoners of conscience immediately,'' the protestersshouted.   Cho, who shouted anti-government slogans before leaping, left anote calling for reunification of North Korea and South Korea andsaying that the south was not a democracy. He demanded the releaseof all political prisoners.   ``As a human being born in this barren land, the Koreanpeninsula, I offer this letter ernestly desiring to see theunification of the fatherland,'' the note said.   Cho, who had a long history of involvement in anti-governmentprotests and who attended Seoul National University, urged theSouth Korean government to make concessions to persuade North Koreato take part in the Olympic Games in Seoul in September. He alsocompared his anguish over the division of Korea to the sufferingand death of Jesus Christ.   Ritual political suicide is a form of protest sometimes used inKorea in an attempt to shame the government and draw attention toradical causes. A number of students have killed themselves inpublic protests in recent years.   Plans were being prepared for a ``democratic peoples' funeral''to bury Cho later in the week. More protests are expected duringthe week.   The death came three days before the May 18 anniversary of the1980 anti-government uprising in the southern city of Kwangju inwhich about 200 people were killed. The anniversary is invariablymarked by anti-government protests.   Opposition leaders expressed regret over the death and demandedthe government free all political prisoners. The governmentcontends only political opponents guilty of sedition or seriouscrimes remain in prison after an amnesty earlier this year.   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam, who visited the morgue whereCho's body was being held, said the death represented ``the voiceof the entire Korean people.''   Korean newspapers reported today that the government wasconsidering freeing more political prisoners. But a governmentspokesman said no decision had been made.   Radical students have been calling for the reunification of thetwo Koreas, divided since 1945. The two nations are bitter rivalsthat have clashed repeatedly over the years.   North Korea is boycotting the Olympic Games to demand it beallowed to co-host the Games.</TEXT></DOC>
