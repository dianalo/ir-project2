(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Navy Modernizes Its Information-Handling at SeaandM;Navy ships depend on on-board computer systems for daily operations, rangingfrom logistics support to maintenance to inventory management.andM;The Shipboard Nontactical ADP Program (SNAP), under the direction of theSpace and Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), is an integrated support systemto modernize ADP systems aboard Navy ships.andP;  It includes applications such asmaintaining personnel records, administration, supply, finance, logistics androutine and scheduled maintenance, officials said.andM;SNAPI is the Navy's effort to modernize information handling aboard largeships, such as submarines and aircraft carriers, while SNAP II is designedfor smaller ships, such as destroyers and frigates.andM;SNAP I replaced antiquated, 1960s batch technology on about 80 ships, with 30more sites yet to be completed, said Shirley Jahn, technical director of theNaval Management Systems Support Office in Chesapeake, Va.andM;SNAP II, while not a replacement system, was designed specifically for use onships and supports shore installations which had no previous standardautomation.andP;  SNAP II will support almost 500 ships and more than 30 shoresites.andM;Subsystems for both SNAP I and SNAP II are writen in COBOL.andP;  The SNAP Isystem runs on Honeywell inc.'s DPS-6 mainframes aboard all ships.andP;  SNAP IISystems use Harris Corp's H-300 computer.andM;SNAP I and SNAP II subsystems interface between supply and maintenance,allowing repair information to be easily exchanged.andP;  The linked systems alsoprovide access to the status of requisitions and availability of material.andM;SNAP SubsystemsandM;The Shipboard Uniform Automated Data Processing System (SUADPS), the first ofthe SNAP I subsystems, processes supply and financial requirements aboardships.andP;  The system receives, issues and inventories all parts and suppliescarried on board large Navy ships.andP;  SUADPS also is used by Marine Corpsaviation units for parts and supply inventory.andM;The Intermediate Maintenance Management System is a real-time interactivemanagement system that keeps track of repair work aboard smaller ships.andP;  Thesystem describes all repairs that need to be done one a ship.andM;The Organizational Maintenance Management System (OMMS) is an interactivedata processing system.andP;  The production management system tracks allshipboard repairs to make sure work is completed on schedule.andP;  It is capableof borkering work out to different repair sites and monitoring performance atthose sites.andM;OMMS now provides life cycle support for 19 sites.andP;  Jahn said more sites willbe added in 1990.andP;  Future developments include the addition of an automatedshore interface and an interface with SUADPS.andM;The Administrative Data Management (ADM) system provides data processingsupport for administrative functions aboard ship, including personnelassignments, assignment of sleeping quarters, the schedule for standing watchon the ship and class assignments, career development and retention programsand health and morale programs.andM;Paying OffandM;The Shipboard Joint Uniform Military Pay System automates support forprocessing payrolls under the Joint Uniform Military Pay System for Navypersonnel.andP;  The system handles all payroll functions.andM;In addition to aDM and OMMS systems, SNAP II uses the Integrated LogisticsManagement (ILM) system to correct a ship's parts and supply deficiencies.andO;The ILM system performs an audit of all equipment on board and then ordersand records additional equipment to bring the ship up to required supplylevels.andM;The Micro Organizational Maintenance Management System (MOMMS) is an on-lineinteractive data processing validation system for very small ships, such astugboats, that are too small to use the OMMS repair system.andP;  MOMMS runs on asingle microcomputer and lets small ships participate with other Navy shipsin the automated shore interface, a closed-loop process that ensures thatchanges made to shipboard equipment are sent through the standard Navyreporting system.andM;The Supply and Financial Management (SFM) system allows SNAP II users toorder and monitor parts, manage inventory and perform financial budgeting andreporting, SFM resources include Logistics Application of Automated Markingand Reading Symbols, which introduces the use of bar coding equipment andautomated data entry techniques, and Mobile Logistics Support force, whichautomates data processing system interfaces and supports the replenishmentfunctions aboard many Navy ships.andM;Since the SNAP systems became automated in the early 1980s, shipboardmaintenance personnel have noticed a marked change in the time it takes toprocess and complete repairs.andM;A SNAP user, Lt.andP;  Cmdr.andP;  Greg Curtis, said the automation saves time andmoney.andM;Curtis, a supply officer who said he has spent several years on ships fittedwith SNAP systems, said that in an emergency a sailor can research the SNAPdatabase to find out if the parts are on board the ship.andP;  He can order theparts and have the material in hand within 15 minutes.andP;  Under non-emergencysituations, the parts can be in hand within a few hours.andM;SNAP also has increased management oversight and reduced human error, Curtissaid.andP;  Before the automation, research and reports were done with microficheand manual ledgers.andP;  No managers can access a terminal to produce listingsand conduct on-screen reviews in minutes.andM;Hardware maintenance for SNAP I is provided by Honeywell Federal SystemsInc., McLean, Va., which manufactures the DPS-6 mainframe.andP;  Harris Corp.andO;Melbourne, Fla.andP;  holds a maintenance contract for all its 300/800 seriescomputers.andM;Unisys Corp.'s defense systems unit in McLean, Va., has a $36 millioncontract to perform maintenance functions and life cycle support for SNAP Isubsystem through 1993.andM;CACI Inc., Virginia Beach, Va., provides maintenance and support for SNAP IIsubsystems.andP;  Although the contrat ended earlier this year, officials extendedit, said Loretta A. De Sio, SPAWAR spokeswoman.andP;  De Sio said a new requestfor proposals was released in April but the contract award has been delayed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
