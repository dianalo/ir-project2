The samples were then bombarded with xenon ions (Xe/sup2+/) at 600 keV to induce ion beam mixing. Rutherford backscatteringand forward recoil spectroscopies were used to probe the changes in themetal and the hydrogen concentrations and profiles respectively. A fluenceof 8 x 10/sup 15/ Xe/sup 2+/ cm/sup -2/ caused mixing of uncharged samplesof Fe-Ti and Ni-Ti. In hydrogenated samples, however, the mixing wassignificantly retarded in the Fe-Ti case, whereas Ni-Ti was still completelymixed. This was found to correlate with the release of hydrogen duringion bombardment. The corresponding final hydrogen concentrations wereone-half of the initial concentration in Fe-Ti and one-third in Ni-Ti.</TEXT></DOC>
