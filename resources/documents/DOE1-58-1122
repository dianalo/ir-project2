These are in good agreement with the energydistribution curves of Ga{sup +} experimentally obtained. This modelis also applied to the energy distributions for the singly charged ionsfrom Au{sub 60}Si{sub 26}Be{sub 14} (at. %) alloy source in which tailsin the high ion energy region appear due to the CT collision betweenthe doubly charged ions and the atoms, in addition to the low energytail. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that both tails alsoexponentially decrease. The intensity ratio between the high- and low-energytails indicates that the ions in the low-energy tail are mainly producedby the CT collision between the doubly charged ions and the atoms.</TEXT></DOC>
