Garcia</HL><DD> 07/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices moved higher in active trading yesterday, following the dollar's advance against the Japanese yen.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 14.19 to close at a record 2463.97. The industrial average surpassed its old high of 2451.05, set June 25.    The broader market indexes also advanced, but they failed to close at highs. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.89 to 308.29, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.53 to 173.42.    The strength in the dollar brought in buy orders from investors in Japan and Europe early yesterday. At home, some institutional investors &quot;were making a bet on stocks that benefit from slightly higher inflation,&quot; one New York-based trader said. Other investors sought stocks that were considered restructuring or takeover candidates.    Volume on the Big Board rose to 207.5 million shares from 200.7 million shares Tuesday. Despite the higher volume and the record close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the advance wasn't as broad as Tuesday's. Yesterday, 833 issues advanced and 721 declined; gainers had a 2-to-1 lead in the previous session.    The American Stock Exchange's Market Value index rose 2.12 to 346.57, closing at a record for the second consecutive session.    Noting the demand among some investors for inflation hedges, Gary Ciminero, chief economist for Fleet Financial Group in Providence, R.I., expects the June producer price index, to be released tomorrow, to show &quot;some flair of inflation.&quot; He is looking for a gain of 0.5% or 0.6%, making it one of the largest gains since January's 0.7% rise.    While the recent increase in crude oil prices was mostly unexpected, he doesn't believe the rise in some non-precious metals and other commodities signals the start of a new inflation spiral. Wage increases remain moderate, he added. Mr. Ciminero sees the higher price increases as more indicative of strong demand from manufacturers and price increases that U.S. companies have been able to implement.    Oil and oil-service stocks, which rose sharply Tuesday, were mostly lower yesterday. However, crude oil prices rose in the futures market.    Gold and steel issues moved higher, while copper and aluminum stocks didn't participate in the advance. ASA moved up 2 7/8 to 60 1/4, Newmont Mining gained 2 1/4 to 54, Campbell Red Lake added 7/8 to 27, Echo Bay Mines moved up 1 3/8 to 38 5/8 and Homestake Mining rose 1/2 to 36 5/8. Inland Steel gained 4 1/4 to 31 1/2, USX moved up 5/8 to 35 5/8 and Bethlehem Steel rose 1 to 17.    Many technology stocks recovered some of Tuesday's losses. International Business Machines, which fell 1 1/4 Tuesday, rose 2 7/8 to 166 3/4. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that some analysts think IBM's second-quarter earnings might exceed the consensus market estimate of $1.86 a share.    Compaq Computer rose 1 3/4 to 44 3/4, Tandem Computers gained 5/8 to 29 1/8, Sun Microsystems added 1 3/4 to 36 7/8, Microsoft rose 3 to 93 1/4 and Cray Research increased 5/8 to 99 1/8.    A great deal of yesterday's trading activity was centered on stocks of companies that investors and arbitragers consider to be ripe targets for a takeover or restructuring.    International Multifoods moved up 4 3/8 to 37 3/4 in heavy trading after moving up 3 3/8 Tuesday. The gain was fueled by takeover speculation. Among the companies mentioned as suitors for this firm was E-II Holdings, which has said it is looking for acquisitions in the $300 million to $500 million range. E-II Holdings declined to comment, and Multifoods said it knew of no reason for the stock activity.    Both the Belzberg family of Canada and Nestle were also rumored to be interested in the company.    Burlington Northern gained 3 to 83 1/2. There were rumors that Wagner andamp; Brown, a Midland, Texas, investment firm, has acquired a stake in the railroad.    Lockheed rose 3 1/2 to 57 3/8 on trading of more than two million shares and PPG Industries gained 1 1/8 to 49 3/8; both stocks moved on restructuring rumors.    Takeover speculation swirled around Gillette again, pushing it up 2 1/4 to 40 1/2 on more than 3.3 million shares. Unilever and American Brands were among the firms mentioned as suitors for Gillette. Bear Stearns was rumored to be a big buyer of the stock for clients.    The decline in Japanese exporters' stocks, which began in the Tokyo market early yesterday, continued on the Big Board. Matsushita Electric Industrial fell 11 3/4 to 142 3/4, Hitachi dropped 5 3/4 to 71 3/4, Kyocera slid 4 1/2 to 72 3/4, Honda Motor sank 5 1/2 to 103 1/8, Sony lost 1 3/4 to 25 3/4 and Pioneer Electronic fell 2 3/4 to 36 1/8.    Texaco gained 1/2 to 45 1/4 as more than 4.2 million shares were traded, making it one of the most active Big Board stocks. A group led by Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court raised its stake in Texaco to 7.4% from 6.4%. Pennzoil, which is engaged in a $10.3 billion lawsuit with Texaco over their disputed ownership of Getty Oil, rose 1 3/4 to 81 3/8.    Fred Leuffer, an oil industry analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence, said that with Mr. Holmes a Court taking a larger stake in Texaco, some investors may be assuming he might take a more active part in bringing the two companies closer to a settlement.    Some of Wall Street's savvy investors are watching the portfolio of Henry Singleton, Teledyne's chairman. Through the company, he has investments in several companies that are candidates for restructurings or takeovers. One arbitrager said many investors believe there is a lot of value in Mr. Singleton's portfolio. Teledyne rose 21 to 377 after gaining 18 Tuesday.    Kidde rose 1/8 to 61 1/2 after jumping 9 7/8 Tuesday when it announced it was considering a restructuring or the sale of all or part of its businesses. Teledyne owns an 18% stake in Kidde.    Other companies in which Teledyne has an investment stake are Litton Industries, which rose 3 5/8 to 106, and Curtiss-Wright, which gained 3 3/4 to 67 1/2. Some investors see Litton as a restructuring candidate.    In the past few weeks, Reichhold Chemicals, another Singleton holding, jumped from below 40 to more than 60 after Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals made a hostile bid for the company. Reichhold yesterday rose 7/8 to 64. Dainippon said Monday that it might sweeten its $473 million bid for Reichhold.    BankAmerica rose 3/8 to 11 5/8. The bank holding company plans to sell discounted stock to existing shareholders in an effort to raise capital. In addition, Japanese banks, securities houses and insurance companies are close to accepting a $350 million recapitalization plan by BankAmerica.    Atcor jumped 7 7/8 to 22 1/2 in the over-the-counter market after Tyco Laboratories said it agreed to acquire the company for $23 a share. Tyco rose 2 3/8 to 47 3/8 on the Big Board. </TEXT></DOC>
