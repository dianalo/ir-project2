In your zeal to make thecase that the political empowerment of minorities through theuse of the Voting Rights Act is &quot;a step backward in thenation's social development,&quot; you have misrepresented myposition and misinterpreted events in Illinois.   From the beginning of the redistricting process, Illinoislegislative leadership and a coalition of Hispanic interestsproposed to gerrymander Cook County to connect twogeographically remote Hispanic neighborhoods while at thesame time preserving the districts of certain ethnicDemocrats. The goal of state Democratic leaders was to ensurethat the creation of a new Hispanic district came at theexpense of Illinois Republicans. Far from usinggerrymandering as a &quot;device&quot; to preserve influence, I soughtonly to maintain reasonably compact and contiguous districtsthat would continue to protect the voting rights ofAfrican-Americans on Chicago's South and West sides.</LP><TEXT>   Few, if any, informed observers of Illinois politics wouldconclude that my own political future has ever been at stakein this process. For 18 years I have enjoyed strong supportfrom African-American and white voters alike in one of thenation's most demographically diverse congressionaldistricts. While the dilution of African-American votingstrength on Chicago's West Side might not hinder my ownpolitical prospects, it could indeed affect the prospects offuture minority candidates and lead to retrogression in thelevel of African-American representation in the U.S.Congress. I am personally committed to maintaining thehard-fought gains made by minorities in Chicago.   My objection to the removal of a certain largelyAfrican-American suburb from my congressional district wasnot based on race, as you imply, but on ideology. In order tohelp shore up the voter base of various Cook CountyDemocrats, Illinois legislative leaders chose to place thoseconstituents in the district of one of Illinois's mostconservative Democratic members, who had recently votedagainst the Civil Rights Act. My constituents made theirobjections clear, and I refused to abandon them. If theSenate plan had placed those areas in the district of one ofmy like-thinking, progressive white colleagues, I would havehad no such objection.   The charge by Democrat Phil Rock, president of theIllinois Senate, that the Voting Rights Act is &quot;misused byincumbents who `hide' behind it to protect their power base,&quot;belies his own motivation and role in the redistrictingprocess. Indeed I developed, in agreement with IllinoisCongressman Charles Hayes, a plan for the creation of amajority Hispanic district that had a minimal effect onexisting minority districts. This plan, the fairest of allproposals, was rejected by Sen. Rock because it interferedwith his alleged commitment to protect the Democratic base ofone of his friends who formerly served with him in theIllinois Legislature.   I agree with you that &quot;Politics works best whenpoliticians speak to concerns that transcend race.&quot; My entirepolitical career has been built on a commitment toprogressive issues that cut across my diverse constituency; acursory look at my election returns over the years supportsthe broad base of support I have enjoyed. However, I do notpretend, as you would like to do, that race has beeneliminated as a factor in our nation's politics. Certainly itis premature to give up the hard-fought protections embodiedin the Voting Rights Act.   Cardiss Collins (D., Ill.)   U.S. House of Representatives   Washington   ---   Your editorial really caught my eye. As a 17-year-oldlooking forward to the 1992 elections, I have been payingmore attention to our country's politics. The right to voteis more than just a privilege. It is a seriousresponsibility, and I want to make educated decisions whencasting my first ballot in 1992. Yet the more I learn, themore confused I become.   It is appalling to learn that politicians who presumablyoppose apartheid in South Africa appear to be proposing aremarkably similar plan for the U.S. in the form of &quot;racialgerrymandering.&quot; These new voting districts divided by racesuspiciously resemble South Africa's black townships.Furthermore, aren't the proposed voting districtsunconstitutional?   In the 1896 case of Plessy v. Ferguson, the practice ofsegregation was upheld with the well-known clause &quot;separatebut equal&quot;; but in the 1954 case of Brown v. the Board ofEducation of Topeka, this decision was overturned.Segregation was outlawed. So how does it come to be thatminority groups are once again being segregated by these newvoting districts?   While these and other political paradoxes continue tobaffle me, my enthusiasm for voting is fading into therealization that the right to vote is more than just aresponsibility -- it's a nightmare] I hope that in time Iwill be able to help bring the light of day to the process.
