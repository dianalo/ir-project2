According to the census, 55% of U.S. households wereheaded by married couples in 1990, down from 60% in 1980.Thirty percent were nonfamily households, or those in whichno two individuals are related by blood, marriage oradoption. That's up from 27% in 1980. In most cases,nonfamily households consist of one person, often elderly,living alone. But in some instances, they include severalpeople who lack traditional family ties.</LP><TEXT>   An additional 15% of households in 1990 were headed byunmarried men or women living with other relatives, in mostcases their children. Overall, the average number of personsper household declined to 2.63 in 1990 from 2.75 in 1980.   The 1980s saw a slight decline in homeownership, with anational owner-occupancy rate of 64.2%, compared with 64.4%in 1980. The percentage of Americans living in their ownhomes had increased steadily since the Depression, and hasmade up more than 60% of the population since the 1960s.   The median value of owner-occupied, one-family houses was$79,100, a 5% increase from 1980 after inflation. Rents grewat a much faster rate; the median contract rent was $374 amonth, a 19% increase from 1980 after inflation.   Ten percent of the nation's housing inventory was vacantin 1990, compared with 9.1% in 1980. But this increase likelyreflects the recent slump in the housing market rather thanany long-term trend, according to Robert Bonnette, a surveystatistician for the Census Bureau.   Home values, rents, and household sizes were all highestin the West and lowest in the Midwest.   Thanks largely to the aging of the baby-boomer population,the median age of Americans rose to 32.9 in 1990 from 30 in1980.   The female population remained a slight majority at 51% in1990. Females represented 52% of the population in theNortheast. That region also was the oldest region, with amedian age of 34.2 years.</TEXT></DOC>
