William Owen, a baldingNebraskan with the expression of someone who is perpetuallyworried. He heads a platoon in the Army's 24th InfantryDivision (Mechanized) -- the first U.S.-based armored unit toreach the field here.</LP><TEXT>   He has plenty to worry about. When it comes to fightingarmored battles in the desert, the platoon is the basic unit.And Lt. Owen's platoon -- like many of those hastilyassembled at Fort Stewart, Ga., for the Persian Gulf crisis-- is missing some pieces. One of his four Bradley FightingVehicles has broken down and the sun has fried the radio in asecond one.   Moreover, the unit arrived 10 men short of its authorized32-man strength, and the spare parts Lt. Owen, 26 years old,needs to fix things are still somewhere being unloaded from aboat.   This site, a gut-wrenching hour's drive over the scrubbydesert from the nearest paved road, is only a temporarytraining area for the 24th. When dusk comes, Lt. Owen and hismen begin training for a move farther north in Saudi Arabia,where they may have to face an armored attack from Iraq.   This is a place where the men dream of cold beer. (BattlePosition Amstel and Battle Position Anheuser are not faraway.) And their officers dream of training. Until Aug. 7,when the 24th was put on alert for duty in the Gulf, theArmy's budget crunch was so severe that much of the platoon's$10.5 million of equipment couldn't be taken out for routineoperations.   Sgt. Frank Rivers, 31, the platoon's second in command, isstill having trouble adjusting to the change since then. &quot;Nowall of a sudden we're the No. 1 priority,&quot; he says. &quot;We canget all the supplies we want.&quot; He spends most of the eveninginstructing troops how to load the Bradley's wire-guided TOWanti-tank missiles.   Since the North African campaign in World War II, thedesert has been considered tank country. While lightly armedunits can fight in the hills and forests of Central Europe,there are few places here for soldiers to hide.   Hence, the Bradley, a way to move infantry around thedesert under the protection of armor. The cannon and TOWs ofthe Bradley, in turn, help protect the vehicle's companion --the M-1 tank -- from enemy infantry.   You also can sleep in and on a Bradley, which becomesimportant after 11 p.m., when training stops. Lt. Owenprefers the rear hatch cover, which he props up with anammunition case. His lanky driver, Ronald Parker, 28, somehowmanages to stretch out in the vehicle's cramped cockpit.   The vehicle's gunner, Pvt. Roger Taylor, 23, sprawlsnearby on a poncho, ignoring the scorpions and thethumb-sized dung beetles that patrol after midnight.&quot;Soldiers,&quot; says Sgt. Rivers, &quot;can sleep anywhere.&quot;   At 4:30 a.m., with the first hint of light, it's back intothe Bradleys again for maneuvers on the now-cooler sea ofsand. Lt. Owen's vehicle takes the lead and he uses flagsignals from the turret to guide the other two -- a way ofcompensating for the broken radio.   When morning training ends, sometimes there are dealingswith the neighbors. Several hundred camels graze nearby, andLt. Owen and his fellow officers have taken great pains tostay away from them and to avoid churning up the roads usedby the Bedouins who herd the camels.   There are signs their efforts will pay off. One Bedouin,after carefully circling Lt. Owen's platoon in his pickuptruck, stopped for a chat. While Arabic is not one of thethings Lt. Owen and his men have been brushing up on, theysoon caught the gist.   &quot;He kept slamming his fist into his palm and saying`Saddam . . . Saddam,'&quot; explains Lt. Owen, referring toIraq's strongman, Saddam Hussein.</TEXT></DOC>
