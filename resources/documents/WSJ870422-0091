The first-quarter profit was about 10 cents a share more than expected by Wall Street analysts and was the strongest increase generated by the retail and financial services concern in four years.    Sears's profit in the quarter rose to $287.9 million, or 75 cents a share, from $195.3 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 12% to $10.48 billion from $9.39 billion.    The first-quarter report rejuvenated Sears stock, which has drifted lower since it hit a 52-week high of $56 a share April 7. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Sears closed yesterday at $53.375 a share, up $2.    Based on the first-quarter profit rise, Edward Weller, an analyst for San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities, raised his estimate for Sears's 1987 earnings to $4.60 a share from his original estimate of $4.25 a share. For 1986, Sears earned $3.62 a share, or $1.35 billion.    The first quarter is the least significant period for Sears's biggest unit, the merchandise group. But Mr. Weller said yesterday's report signals that the merchandise group's strategy of cutting distribution costs and more competitive pricing will boost the group's profit 20% this year.    A loss in the first quarter by Sears's U.S. stores isn't unusual because winter merchandise is cleared out in the period. Linda Kristiansen, an analyst for New York-based PaineWebber Inc., said the domestic stores narrowed their operating loss in the quarter to $13.1 million from a $22.7 million loss a year earlier. In the recent quarter, a $20 million charge for the closing of some warehouse facilities made the loss for U.S. stores about $33.1 million, she said. Sears forecast the charge in March.    Sears said profit for the merchandise group, which includes U.S. and foreign stores as well as its credit operation, fell in the quarter to $31.3 million from $42.1 million a year earlier primarily because of the special charge.    Total revenue for the merchandise group rose 5.7% to $5.77 billion from $5.46 billion.    Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group, which has been spending heavily on expanding its market share of U.S. home sales, generated the bulk of a $93.6 million pre-tax gain from the sale of a suburban Dallas shopping center. The gain made profit for the group $39.3 million, compared with $16.8 million for the 1986 first quarter. The group's revenue rose 19% to $237.5 million from $200.1 million.    At the Allstate Insurance Group, higher investment income and a $33.2 million tax benefit from the new tax laws for discounting loss reserves helped boost first-quarter profit 40% to $246.9 million from $176.4 million. Revenue for the group rose 26% to $3.65 billion from $2.89 billion for the yearearlier quarter.    Sears's Dean Witter Financial Services Group, which absorbed a $25.8 million loss from the new Discover credit card, reported a first-quarter profit of $6.1 million, compared with a $6.4 million loss for the 1986 first quarter. The loss from the launch of the Discover card was slightly less than expected by some analysts.    Revenue for the Dean Witter group rose 11% to $937.5 million from $842.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
