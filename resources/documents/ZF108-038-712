 The workstationswill replace dumb terminals currently installed in traders'offices and will run Automated Pit Trading (APT), a softwarepackage that attempts to simulate a trading floor inhigh-resolution color graphics.andP;  It will operate across anEthernet network with another Sun workstation as a file server.andO;LIFFE chose workstations for its new automation system becauseminicomputers could not provide the graphics capability needed ata reasonable price/performance ratio.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   London International Financial Futures Exchange (automation).andO;Topic:     WorkstationsMarket EntrySecurities TransferStock MarketReduced-Instruction-Set Computers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Stations of thoughtandM;I recently visited the site of what will be one of the largest networks ofworkstations in the City: LIFFE (London International Financial FuturesExchange).andP;  LIFFE is similar to the Stock Exchange in function, but trades injust 23 different items -- these being futures and options.andP;  Currently, theLIFFE trading floor is full of 300 'dumb' screens, several hundred textterminals and a similar number of two-way radios -- all used by young gentswearing brightly coloured jackets.andM;The current system is called open outcry and the noise is deafening -- tomake a deal someone offers to sell a futures option at a certain price (byyelling); this is valid for as long as the trader's 'breath is warm'.andO;Another trader can buy if so instructed from a distant client whocommunicates by calling the trader's office, which then sends a message to agofer on the floor who waves and yells until his trader notices him.andM;All this is about to change; the four VAX minicomputers that currently driveall the information displays (the dumb terminals mentioned above) are goingto be replaced by 300-odd Sun workstations.andP;  Eventually, the traders willwork from their respective offices.andP;  No yelling, nothing.andP;  Instead there'llbe an impressive looking piece of software called APT (Automated Pit Trading)running on their own personal Sun.andP;  APT is different from other financialsystems in that it tries to simulate the crowded, noisy dealing of thetrading floor -- but in high-resolution colour graphics.andP;  Each trader isrepresented as a little icon in their allotted position on screen.andM;The network of workstations will use the Ethernet cards built in to the SunSPARCstations as the primary networking medium, then link traders' officestogether using British Telecom's Kilostream data lines as bridges.andP;  All thiswill converge back on to three LIFFE buildings linked together withfibre-optic bridges.andP;  With the 300 workstations running, the whole distrubtednetwork will be able to cope with 100 transactions (trades) per second andwill have a response time of two tenths of a second.andM;The server that looks after all this isn't a Cray, it's another Sunworkstation and has little work to do; when a trade is made it records thisand sends the information to another recoding system.andP;  It also arbitrates andensures that messages from individual workstations get sent around thenetwork as required, but, just in case, another two slave servers are runningready to take over.andP;  To give an idea of the load the workstations will haveto cope with, the exchange is open from 8am to 4.15pm and has a maximum of300,000 trades per day (worth a pretty impressive 39 pound sterling billion).andO;This rpresents around 12 trades per second so, continuing the trend of 100per cent grwth in activity per year (which was the growth from 1988 to 1989),the system will last for three years.andP;  Hopefully, by then BT will have comeup with something faster than the Kilostream lines, which will improveoverall speed.andM;Why LIFFE and its consultants, PA Consulting, chose workstations rather thana centralized server, such as the original VAXes that were already in place,is answered by Roger Barton, LIFFE's director of technical services: &quot;we werelooking for very high-performance and very high-resolution graphics.&quot;andP;  Butwhy not use PCs with high-resolution monitors attached as terminals to theVAXes?andP;  &quot;The VAX is a different animal, we have a VAX system running inreal-time, but it wouldn't provide the performance required.&quot;andM;As a comparison, 300 Sun SPARCstation 1's (at around 6,200 pound sterlingeach -- and each providing between 9.5 and 12.5 Mips) would total 1.86 poundsterling million and provide a distributed power of around 3,000Mips -- a topof the range VAX, say the new 9000 series, would cost around 1.5 poundsterling million and would offer maybe 30 to 70Mips.andP;  Hardly a faircomparison, but the distributed power and speed of the workstation setuprivals the mini and in this case the workstations don't have to do very much-- but they do do it quickly.andM;Go faster technology.andP;  On the technology front, the Sun-designed SPARC RISCprocessor chip, mentioned in the last issue, has been implemented using ECLtechnology.andP;  ECL (Emitter Coupled Logic) technology is a method of designingintegrated circuits which provides about the fastest operation available insilicon; it beats the other technologies (TTL and CMOS) by cutting out anystray capacitances within the circuit.andP;  Capacitance stores charge and thismust be allowed to discharge before the circuit can do something else (likeswitch logical state).andM;The trouble with ECL is that it requires all the supporting chips to belocated very close to the ECL chipset to minimize noise and cut downtransmission time.andP;  The ECL implementation of the SPARC chip is from BipolarInformation Technologies (BIT) and is rated at 64Mips.andM;This should be good news for the half-dozen licensees who use SPARCtechnology to make up their own workstations.andP;  The SPARC chipset is nowrivalling Intel's 80X86 range of processors as a wide-based platform;currently the likes of Toshiba, ICL and Philips are manufacturingSPARC-compatible workstations.andM;The workstation market is beginning to gel into two distinct platforms,SPARC-compatible and the rest.andP;  This, coupled with the emerging Unixrationalization, makes workstations as compatible a platform as the PC --though the software support is still lacking.andP;  There are around 50,000applications for the PC but under a tenth of this number for Unix-running,SPARC-compatible machines.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
