News of the incident in the city of Chengdu first appeared in anarticle today in the official China Youth News.   A league official, Yang Ling, told The Associated Press bytelephone from Chengdu that one of the victims had an electric prodapplied to his head and cannot speak clearly or raise one arm.   Ms. Yang said the attack occurred Dec. 30 and led to a sit-indemonstration by youth league members at Chengdu city offices.   Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province.   The China Youth News story was unusual because Chinese papersrarely run in-depth accounts of official brutality. An articleearlier this week in the People's Daily acknowledged that tortureand forced confessions do occur, but, unlike today's report, it gaveno details.   The article was an indication China is facing serious problems ofpublic order resulting from its current economic difficulties.   A price reform program, along with official corruption, hasresulted in China's highest inflation since the communist revolutionin 1949. Inflation was officially 19 percent last year, but itsactual level could be twice that.   The league has demanded legal action be taken against thegovernment workers who allegedly participated in the attack. Thecase is under investigation.   The China Youth News article said officials from a cityinspection team responsible for overseeing economic activity inChengdu joined in the attack.   The report, based on six eyewitness accounts, said 40 members ofthe team, wielding electric prods, handcuffs and tear gas, burstinto the crowd shortly after 11 a.m. and stopped a special sale of300 hard-to-get products, including poultry, fish, soy sauce andspirits.   The sale was organized by the Youth League of the ChineseCommunist Party. League members in the city's Commerce Departmentinformed the city government of the sale but had yet to receivepermission to put it on, the report said.   Ms. Yang said league members had assumed the government wouldapprove the sale since it was designed to help the people.   According to the report, soon after the sale began the inspectionbureau ordered it halted.   Members of the inspection team arrived on the scene and``violently suppressed the sale,'' the paper said.   Four league members were arrested. They were released later thatday after a high-ranking Communist Party official intervened, thereport said.</TEXT></DOC>
