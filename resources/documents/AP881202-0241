Under the ``heads of agreement,'' similar to a letter of intent,Unocal and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. will each hold a 50 percentshare in the new venture.   Officials said the new pact is contingent on the partnersnegotiating acceptable crude oil supply agreements. But   Unocal said it expects to realize in excess of $500 million ifthe joint venture is completed.   ``The formation of this joint venture would provide Unocal withmore reliable margins and significant cash which we will apply todebt repayment or other uses,'' said Richard J.
