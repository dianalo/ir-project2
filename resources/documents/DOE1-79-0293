<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-79-0293 </DOCNO><TEXT>A dc Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) was used as atuned radio-frequency amplifier at liquid helium temperatures to detectvery-low-signal magnetic resonance phenomena. Three experiments wereperformed. In the first experiment, a dc SQUID was used to detect pulsednuclear quadrupole resonance at about 30 MHz. At a bath temperature of4.2K, a total system noise temperature of 6 +/- 1K was achieved, witha quality factor Q of 2500. A novel Q-spoiler, consisting of a seriesarray of Josephson tunnel junction, reduced the ring-down time of thetuned circuit after each pulse. The minimum number of nuclear Bohr magnetonsobservable from a free-precession signal after a single pulse was about2 x 10{sup 16} in a bandwidth of 10 kHz. In the second experiment, asample of nuclear spins was placed in the inductor of a tuned LCR circuitand the spectral density of current fluctuations in the circuit was measuredusing a dc SQUID as an rf amplifier. The measurements were made in liquidhelium at 1.5K on samples of NaClO{sub 3} and KClO{sub 3}, each of whichexhibit a {sup 35}Cl NQR transition at about 30 MHz. In the third experiment,precessing nuclear quadrupole moments were observed to induce oscillatingelectric dipole moments in neighboring atoms. The {sup 35}Cl nuclei ofa single crystal of NaClO{sub 3} placed between the plates of a capacitorwere excited into precession by a rf pulse.</TEXT></DOC>
