About 10,000 striking workers from 12 plants fought police withrocks and firebombs in the southeastern industrial city ofChangwon, demanding the release of jailed strike leaders.   In the nearby port of Masan, about 3,000 workers also clashedwith police, demanding pay increases and the release of strikeleaders. Protesters set fire to a governing office and threw rocksat several police posts.   About 1,000 students in the southern city of Kwangju clashedwith police after a campus rally at which they burned effigies ofPresident Bush and President Roh Tae-woo.   Police officials said two riot troopers had been seriouslyinjured in Changwon, but they had no further details. It was notknown immediately if there were any workers injured or arrested.   In Seoul, an estimated 4,500 students hulring rocks andfirebombs battled police at three universities in support ofstriking workers and scheduled border talks between students ofSouth and North Korea.   About 10,000 students at the state-run Seoul National Universityboycotted classes and held an anti-government campus rally,denouncing alleged government suppression of labor movement.   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo,'' students shouted, shooting clenchedfists into the sky.   After the student rally, about 3,000 tried to march into thestreets, hurling rocks and firebombs. Police fired tear gas todrive them back.   No injuries or arrests were reported.   Campus clashes were also reported in Anyang, Chunchon, Chongjuand Taejon.   Student leaders said they will march to the border village ofPanmunjom Friday for talks with North Korean students on unitingthe Korean peninsula and taking part in an international youthfestival in Pyongyang in July.   Authorities outlawed the march and said police would block it.Last year, several marches for unification were blocked by police.   The United National Democratic Movement, the main dissidentalliance, said they would hold a labor rally Sunday in Seouldespite a government ban and said police would be responsible forany violence.   About 30 labor leaders were arrested in police raids in SeoulThursday as the government moved against radical labor groups,police said. Those arrested face charges of staging illegalstrikes, they said.   The radical students have been staging almost daily violentprotests in recent weeks to demand the overthrow of the Rohgovernment. The radicals and allied dissident groups lackwidespread popular support and are not seen as a threat to the Rohgovernment.   But government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrestand a wave of increasingly violent strikes for better pay andimproved working conditions. Student and dissident groups areattempting to unite with workers to build an anti-governmentalliance.   Dissident leaders claim Roh is a front for military rule anddemand the former general step down. Roh won a December 1987election after rival opposition candidates split the oppositionvote.</TEXT></DOC>
