Battlingcensorship ought to be a duty for every decentminded citizen;advocating that taxpayers be forced to underwrite the arts(and saying the subject is not open to legitimate discussion)is quite another matter. There are good and proper argumentsfor closing down the National Endowment for the Arts.   In American theater from the plays of Eugene O'Neill orGeorge S. Kaufman and the musicals of Victor Herbert orJerome Kern through the later masterpieces of TennesseeWilliams and Richard Rodgers, producers and their privateinvestors could bank on reasonable assurances that playgoerslining up at the box office would give them a handsomeprofit. When films from &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot; on to more recentblockbusters could not be financed from a studio orproducer's earlier earnings, banks were happy to lend money,again feeling confident that public response would lock in areturn on their investment. Book buyers saw to it thatpublishers of favorites from Twain to Michener kept ledgersin black ink.</LP><TEXT>   True, in other countries in other times enlightenedprinces often harbored and nurtured fine talent. But that hasnot been nor should it be the American way. In fact, it isnot a truly analogous situation.   Somerset Maugham once wrote something to the effect thatthe classics in any field are culled from bygone, popularsuccesses. Discovery of an Emily Dickinson is extremely rare.So why not let book buyers, concertgoers, theater lovers andkindred souls in the other arts decide with their purchaseswhat they want to see and what therefore should be offered.Bureaucrats doling out support to self-indulgent eccentricsis a waste of time and money. Who needs islands covered withplastic sheeting, five-hour-long operas and pictures ofreligious figures bathed in urine? Or do I hear a cry forgovernment underwriting to revive Restoration masques?   Gerald Bordman   Kirk's Mills, Pa.   ---   What can Mr. Wilson mean by a &quot;vigorous, informed debate&quot;that prohibits the mention of abolition? It is all too easyto label one's philosophical opponents &quot;demagogues&quot; and avoidfacing fundamental questions about the role of government inthe arts by ridiculing the likes of Sen. Jesse Helms and theRev. Pat Robertson.   As we say to the neighborhood bullies, Mr. Wilson, pick onsomebody your own size. Well-meaning people in high placeswho would like to test their philosophical and moralfoundations on this issue before lumping us together withMessrs. Helms and Robertson might search out representativesof that (very small) minority of us in the arts who opposeforcing others to support our chosen and privilegedprofession.
