 It shines intesting unshielded twisted pair cable for problems such as crosstalk andattenuation.andP;  It tells you if the twisted pair quality is sufficient for usewith Token Ring and 10BaseT Ethernet.andP;  The Pair Scanner is a must for thoseworking with unshielded twisted pair networks.andM;It has earned its rightful place in the Microtest family, which includes theCable Scanner and the Lanport.andP;  With the Cable Scanner, Microtest was thefirst company to bring to market an inexpensive, easy-to-use time domainreflectometer (TDR).andP;  While TDRs are a critical tool in any installer's bagof tricks, they were often difficult to use without technical training intelephone and wiring technology.andM;The Pair Scanner is a more sophisticated version of the company's criticallyacclaimed Cable Scanner.andP;  The Pair Scanner has special features for checkingtelephone-style, unshielded twisted pair cable.andP;  It can also test any typecable in the IBM Cabling System.andP;  And like its sibling, the Pair Scanner iseasy to use.andP;  It reports information back in English, rather than obscuretelephony notation.andM;Telephone style, unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable has always been anattrative alternative for LANs.andP;  The combination of low materials cost, lowinstallation cost (especially for existing cable), well developed cablemanagement products and techniques that make moves and changes relativelypainless, a natural distributed star topology to ease troubleshooting, plusthe ability to run IBM 3278 terminals, async terminals, Arcnet, Ethernet, andToken Ring all on the same type of cable make UTP many LAN administrators'cable of choice.andM;But unshielded twisted pair isn't a solution without problems.andP;  People assumethat the LAN can use any old cable originally run in the walls for telephoneservice.andP;  Often after months of poor network performance, they discover thatthe problem was bad cable.andP;  Instead of wasting all that maintenance andtroubleshooting time (not to mention the cost and time of the originalinstallation), they needed a $2,500 tool to tell them if the cable qualitywas good enough for data.andP;  A Microtest Pair Scanner can tell you if yourexisting cable is good enough for Token Ring or 10BaseT Ethernet.andM;Cable TestingandM;Like Microtest's Cable Scanner, the Pair Scanner is first and foremost a TDR.andO;It works by sending a high-speed pulse down the cable and then measuring howlong it takes for the reflection of that pulse to return.andP;  A reflection iscaused by an impedance mismatch like a break in the cable, a short or a badconnector.andP;  Since data pulses travel at a fixed speed for any given type ofcable, the TDR can tell you how far down the cable the fault is.andP;  Since datatravels at different rates through different cables, you need to tell yourTDR what kind of cable you are testing.andP;  But unlike many TDRs, with the PairScanner you aren't stuck inputting the cable's esoteric electricalcharacteristics.andP;  The Pair Scanner comes preprogrammed for most of the cablesyou're likely to find in a LAN, including all the cables defined in the IBMCabling System: coax, thin coax, shielded twisted pair, and UTP.andM;While the Cable Scanner tells you how far it is to the first fault on thecable, the Pair Scanner tells you how far it is to the biggest reflection onthe cable, which is most likely to be the total cable length.andP;  This comes inhandy on thin Ethernet systems, where the T-connectors can create minorreflections and on twisted pair systems, where each 66-block can create asmall reflection.andM;Because it uses a 12-bit digital-to-analog converted (DAC), the Pair Scanneris more sensitive than the Cable Scanner, which uses an 8-bit DAC.andP;  You canalso adjust the sensitivity of the Pair Scanner to tell it to ignore thekinds of very small reflections you get from T-connectors and 66-blocks.andP;  TheCable Scanner could not be adjusted to overlook these small reflections.andM;More than a TDRandM;The Pair Scanner isn't just a TDR.andP;  Using a Pair Scanner, you can measure thenoise level on the cable in three different frequency bands plus impulsenoise.andP;  You can also measure crosstalk between the pairs of a cable.andP;  This isimportant if you are running voice and data through the same cable.andP;  With alot of crosstalk, the 105 volts that ring the phone's bells can cause dataerrors in adjacent pairs.andM;Notably, you can use the signal injector that comes with the Pair Scanner tomeasure the attenuation (or signal loss) in a piece of cable.andP;  You simplyhook the signal injector to one end of the cable and the Pair Scanner to theother.andP;  The Pair Scanner will then report the amount of loss in the cable.andO;The amount of loss is key to a cable's usefulness and the acceptable levelscan be found in the networks specifications.andP;  If your cables have more than11.5 dB of loss, you can't use them for 10BaseT.andM;Using the Pair Scanner's RJ-45 jack, you can switch back and forth betweenthe transmit and receive pairs on the cable simply by pushing a button on theMicrotest tool.andP;  This is much easier than having to disconnect and reconnectwires.andM;The next release (which should ship by the time you read this) will also havea one button &quot;go&quot; or &quot;no go&quot; function to check both pairs of the cable foreverything but attenuation.andM;Like the Cable Scanner, the Pair Scanner can also be used as a networkactivity monitor for Ethernet and other CSMA/CD networks.andP;  It can storeactivity data for the last 24 hours on a minute by minute basis and print areport of the data.andP;  You can even program it to dial a modem and send amessage if the activity level is too high or if the line has been quiet toolong.andP;  It can also generate the 10Base-T link bit to activate a port on aconcentrator to test the whole cable to concentrator data path.andP;  But it costsmuch less than the more traditional network monitors.andM;Microtest has several optional extras to work with the Pair Scanner.andP;  TheSmart-Ts work with the Pair Scanner's office locator function.andP;  You get a setof eight Smart-T cable connecters and hook one up to the data outlet in eachoffice.andP;  The Pair Scanner will then report the number of the Smart-T when youplug in the other end of the cable in the wiring closet.andP;  This makes findingthe exact wire much simpler.andM;The RS-232 features of the Pair Scanner are greatly enhanced over those ofthe Cable Scanner.andP;  You can use the Pair Scanner to identify the baud rate ofa data stream, to indicate the status of the seven most used RS-232 lines(Rx, Tx, DSR, CTS, DTR, RI and CD), to send a test data stream, and as linemonitor with a 2KB buffer.andM;Avoiding UTP PitfallsandM;Although a TDR will locate wiring problems, the best maintenance method is agood installation to prevent these glitches from occurring in the firstplace.andP;  Here are four pitfalls you need to avoid when you're planning toinstall a network using twisted pair.andM;The first is using the wrong cable.andP;  The term &quot;twisted pair&quot; means just that;the two wires in a pair absolutely must be twisted around each other.andP;  If youuse telephone cable known as silver satin (the flat silver stuff you usebetween your phone and the wall) that doesn't have enough twists in it, youare likely to have problems with your network.andP;  The twists in the cable makeit more resistant to noise.andP;  Untwisted cable acts like an antennatransmitting your data out into the air rather than sending it down the cableand absorbing electrical noise like a sponge.andP;  On a Pair Scanner, cable withan insufficient number of twists will have excessive attenuation (dB loss).andM;The quality of most residential telephone wires and commercial wiringinstalled more than about 10 years ago isn't good enough for data.andP;  The cableyou're looking for has at least two twists per foot and meets either the IBMType 3 or ATandamp;T DIW (D-style inside wire) specification.andP;  In a four paircable, such as you would use for SynOptics Lattisnet or 10BaseT Ethernet, thepairs will be colored blue/white, green/white, orange/white and brown/whitel.andO;The blue/white pair is a blue wire with white stripes and a white wire withblue stripes.andP;  Red, blue, green and black wires are the wrong stuff.andM;A second mistake is not paying enough attention to installation detailsCables should pass through as few 66 or 110 blocks as possible.andP;  There shouldbe a clear distinction between voice and data pairs so that the telephonerepair people won't rip out your cross connects (the wires between punch downblocks) while searching for what's causing the phones to act up.andP;  Wheninstalling networks for my clients, I use different colors of cross connectwire for voice and data.andP;  I also put a sign up in the wiring closet tellingthe voice experts which cable is which.andP;  If you're designing a new space, youshould have the voice and data cables pulled to different blocks.andM;Tools and connectors are also important.andP;  You should always use a rachet-typecrimper for your modular connectors.andP;  A rachet crimper won't open until ithas been closed completely, so you always get a good solid crimp.andP;  If you usethe $10 plastic Radio Shack crimper you'll occasionally get a bad connection.andO;On 66 blocks, you should always use an impact punch-down tool to ensure asolid connection.andM;Finally, you should make sure that you use the right modular connectors.andO;RJ-11s and RJ-45s for solid and stranded conductor cable are madedifferently.andP;  If you use the more common stranded cable connector on solidconductor cable, you may have problems down the line.andM;If you're careful about your installations and just use some common sense, atwisted pair network can be significantly less expensive and more flexiblethan a coax network.andM;In the EndandM;Like Microtest's Cable Scanner, the Pair Scanner is a valuable tool for anyLAN installer or repair technician.andP;  Anyone installing networks on existingtwisted pair cable needs one.andP;  It is the only affordable way to test existingtwisted pair cable for use with Token Ring or 10Base-T Ethernet.andP;  Even firmsrunning coax or shielded twisted pair networks should have one.andM;Executive SummaryandM;Requirements: Any type cable in the IBM Cabling System except fiber.andM;Installation: Simple.andP;  Connect the cable ends into the Pair Scanner's ports.andM;Ease of use: Much easier than the typical TDR or network monitor.andM;Documentation: Good but not outstanding.andP;  Could use more examples.andM;Robustness/Compatibility: No problems.andP;  Works well and plays well withothers.andM;Usefulness: Indespensible for the serious LAN installer's tool kit.andM;Howard Marks is the principal of Networks Are My Life, a network consultingfirm based in Hoboken, NJ.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
