Ada and Pascal code simply by choosing theappropriate option off the system's menu, which allows all software developedto be portable, Gersznowicz added.andP;  Further, Cradle has traceability featuresto allow government developers to look at where the different systemrequirements wound up in the code, how the requirements were changed alongthe way, and by whom.andM;&quot;Traceability seems to be very important in the DOD market,&quot; Gersznowiczsaid.andM;Cradle has not received any government security rating, but that is&quot;something we are looking into,&quot; he said.andM;In the meantime, Cradle allows for five levels of lockout.andM;The system also can be set up so that individual developers can see andchange only the pieces they are developing, project leaders can see andchange soemwhat more, and so on, Yourdon executives said.andM;Other features of Cradle include &quot;comprehensive verification&quot; to ensure thatall design criteria comply with the Yourdon Structured Methodology.andP;  &quot;It willnot allow you to make a mistake,&quot; Gersznowicz said, although users can bypasssome of the controls if they wish.andP;  Change control and configurationmanagement features are included as well.andM;Also part of Cradle is something called &quot;balancing verification&quot; to make surethe content of the data flow diagrams conforms to the process specifications.andO;And developers can have many different windows open at once, to edit,generate or simply look at some code.andP;  The menu-driven system also includescontext-sensitive help.andM;Cradle, which runs on the Apollo DN Series of workstations, supports networksincluding Ethernet, Domain and Token-Ring.andP;  But Cradle does not requireApollo's Network Computing System or any Apollo proprietary software.andP;  AndCradle locks to the network, not to the node, so the only limitation is thenumber of nodes a user has licensed.andM;Cradle is available now for a single-user price of $12,500.andP;  Prices for a20-user system would run about $3,000 per user.andP;  The price includes a year ofunlimited telephone support and free upgrades.andM;Yourdon, which became a subsidiary of Eastman Kodak Co. in December 1987, hasanother CASE package on the market.andP;  Called the Analyst Designer Tollkit, itruns on MS-DOS machines and is a front-end tool for analysis and design.andP;  Itdoes not generate code or documentation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
