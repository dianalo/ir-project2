The other four, including the 22-year-old pilot, were pulled outof the murky water by police Harbor Unit officers who found two menclinging to pontoons and two grasping for other bits of wreckage.They were not seriously injured.   The accident occurred almost three years to the day after ahelicopter operated by a subsidiary of the same company, IslandHelicopter Corp., plunged into the East River with eight peopleaboard. One man, a Japanese businessman, died.   In Sunday morning's accident, the helicopter had just completeda 15-to-20-minute tour of Manhattan when it plunged into the riverabout 15 blocks north of its destination, the 34th Street heliport,police said.   The aircraft, a Bell 206-B, was hovering about 1,000 feet abovethe river awaiting permission to land when the pilot ``experiencedperformance difficulties,'' said George Dempster, chairman ofIsland Helicopters.   The pilot activated emergency flotation pontoons and ``initiatedemergency landing procedures,'' Dempster said. On impact, however,the flotation devices apparently separated from the rest of thecraft.   Rescue efforts culminated in scuba divers finding a passengerstrapped to a rear seat of the helicopter on the bottom of theriver, 35 feet below the surface.   The water temperature was in the mid-40s, and the man had beenunder water more than 100 minutes, divers said.   The passenger, identified as Takashi Oyama by the JapaneseConsulate, was taken to Bellevue Hospital where he died at 9:05p.m., said Peter Schectman, a hospital adminstrator.   Three of the others also were taken to Bellevue, where they werelisted in stable condition. They included the pilot, RobertMarshall, of Sea Cliff, N.Y., and two passengers, Yuichiro Suzuki,30, of Columbus, Ohio, and Furman Alexander, 34, a resident ofAustralia.   A passenger identified as Gotthelf Max Christian, 55, of Munich,W. Germany, was taken to Cabrini Hospital, where he was in goodcondition, according to a police spokeswoman, Sgt. Diane Kubler.
