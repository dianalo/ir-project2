StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN CANDA FRESTMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar eased in foreign exchange trading but still gathered some support from fears of a widening Persian Gulf conflict and strong oil prices.    The British pound slipped in response to U.K. economic data that raised some concern about inflation.    Dealers predicted the dollar will trade in a narrow range for the rest of the week but will show a tendency to climb. However, they said, the U.S. currency could stumble in response to today's Capitol Hill testimony by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and his designated successor, Alan Greenspan.    The dollar also will be tested by U.S. economic indicators to be released this week. Data on durable-goods orders will be disclosed Thursday, and the second-quarter gross national product will be announced Friday.    As trading opened in Asia yesterday, the dollar came under selling pressure from Japanese securities houses and manufacturers converting overseas earnings to yen. In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 152.73 yen, compared with 152.95 late Friday. It also inched lower to 1.8621 West German marks from 1.8625 and eased similarly against most other European currencies.    In early Tokyo trading today, the dollar was quoted at 152.30 yen.    Although the dollar was slightly lower on the day, many traders said the currency has a good chance of strengthening this week because of conflicts in the Persian Gulf area.    Tensions appeared to worsen yesterday as France and Iran each continued sieges of the other's embassy after breaking diplomatic relations last week. Meanwhile, two Kuwaiti oil tankers began flying the U.S. flag in preparation for possible escort by U.S. Navy ships for protection against Iranian attacks.    &quot;The whole gulf situation is a wild card right now that could make the dollar much stronger,&quot; Audrey A. McNiff, a trader at Irving Trust Co., New York, said.    Conflict in the Persian Gulf helps the dollar in two ways. First, as a &quot;safe haven&quot; currency, the dollar traditionally benefits in times of international instability. Second, the dollar gets support from the higher oil prices that result from threats to the supply of Middle East oil shipped through the gulf. Because most oil exporters demand payment in dollars, higher prices mean importers must acquire more dollars to pay their bill.    Bullish oil-price prospects, however, couldn't help sterling avert a slight decline yesterday after British economic news raised concern about inflation. The government reported that retail sales and bank lending soared beyond market expectations last month, indicating that the economy might be overheating.    The pound slipped to $1.5990 from $1.6030 and to 2.98 marks from 2.99.    Today's scheduled testimony before separate congressional panels by Messrs. Volcker and Greenspan will be closely watched by currency traders. Dealers said comments by either one could spur activity in the market and give clues to Fed policy and the dollar's direction in the near future.    Mr. Greenspan's hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on his nomination to succeed Mr. Volcker is of particular interest because &quot;the market wants to find out what kind of inflation fighter he's going to be and what his attitude toward the dollar is going to be,&quot; Thomas R. Benfer, a trader for Bank of Montreal in New York, said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $3.20 an ounce to $451.30 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.9 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $452.25 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Monday, July 20, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
