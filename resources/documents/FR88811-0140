The Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System(CPARS) will assess contractor performance on current AFSC contracts foruse in future contact award decisions. These assessments will be preparedby AFSC program directors and forwarded to the contractor for review andcomment. This part is limited in scope to contracts for concept demonstrationand validation, full-scale development, or full-rate production and deploymentefforts.

A numberof comments were received that resulted in changes throughout the document.Summarized below are the general and specific comments received and actionstaken.a. <T3>Comment: </T3>It can be difficult to apply objective perspectives tocomplex issues. There is little incentive for program managers to commentobjectively on possible actions by the government or its consultants thatmay have adversely affected contractor performance.<T3>Response: </T3>The CPAR was structured with a check and balance systemto gain an objective assessment. Both the government and contractor perspectivesare captured. In addition, each assessment is reviewed by a managementlevel above the program manager to ensure the assessment is based on objectivedata. The rule has been amended to discuss the checks and balances of thesystem (andSection;838.1(c)) and revised to require the assessments be basedon objective facts.b. <T3>Comment: </T3>Revise the program phase terminology used to be consistentwith the more commonly used terminology within DOD Directive 5000.1. ReviseRandamp;D terminology to correlate with new science and technology program.<T3>Response: </T3>Throughout the rule the terminology has been revisedas requested.c. <T3>Comment: </T3>The CPAR assessment should be completed by either theprogram manager or director. In some situations, the program director isa general officer and could serve as the reviewing official.<T3>Response: </T3>Throughout the rule ``or program manager'' has beenadded after ``program director.''d. <T3>Comment: </T3>Clarify the difference between the initial CPAR assessment(andSection;838.5) and the initial assessment sent to the contractor (andSection;838.6).Revise the instructions to have the program director sign his or her assessmentwhen it is final and ready to be sent to the reviewing official.<T3>Response: </T3>The rule has been clarified to distinguish between theinitial CPAR assessments to be completed between 180 and 360 days aftercontract award and the ``preliminary'' assessments that the program directoror manager sends to the contractor. In addition, the timing of the programdirector or manager's signature on the form has been delayed until afterit has been reviewed by the contractor.e. <T3>Comment: </T3>The entire CPAR assesses ``contract'' performance. Whydo you have a separate assessment block on the form for ``contracts?''Recommend deleting such a category and have the subitems ``cost performance''and ``management responsiveness'' become primary items.<T3>Response: </T3>The ``contracts'' item has been deleted. ThroughoutandSection;838.10 the numbering of items and placement of guidance has beenrearranged.f. In addition to the comments and changes addressed above, editing changeswere made and appropriate regulatory references were added throughout therule for clarification purposes.g. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.2(a). This rule should not apply to Air ForceContract Management Division (AFCMD) since their only buying activity isKirtland Contracting Center (KCC). KCC primarily supports the laboratorieson base and only has a few weapons systems acquisitions.<T3>Response: </T3>AFCMD deleted.h. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.2(b). Eliminate the encouragement to ``broadenthe application of CPARs to additional contract efforts and contractorsfor (field activity) own use.'' Recommend that at least until a successfulcommand-wide CPAR implementation has been launched and a usage cultureestablished, such local utilization be prohibited to preclude potentialabuse or bifurcation of the main purpose.<T3>Response: </T3>Guidance revised to discourage broadening the applicationof CPARs and requires a high approval level for such actions (i.e., AFSC/CV).These requests will be closely monitored by the OPR, HQ AFSC/PK.i. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.4(a). Revise office symbol for receipt oflocal supplements to HQ AFSC/SD. They are responsible for maintaining therule and should be the recipient.<T3>Response: </T3>Revised as requested.j. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.5(a). Delete guidance concerning contractsin existence when the system is initiated. This guidance is needed on aone time basis and should be included in the implementation transmittalletter.<T3>Response: </T3>Deleted as requested.k. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.5(b) Recommend allowing contractors an opportunityto request their CPARs be updated if a significant change in performancehas occurred.<T3>Response: </T3>Amended to address such a contractor's request.l. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.5(b) and (c). Clarify the period of performanceto be covered by the intermediate and final CPARs.<T3>Response: </T3>Revised to clarify that both the intermediate and finalCPARs are limited to contractor performance occurring after the precedingCPAR. The final is not a summary of the entire contract effort.m. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.6(c). Recommend that all CPAR ratings bediscussed in face-to-face meetings.<T3>Response: </T3>Section 838.6(c) has been revised to ``strongly recommend''face-to-face meetings. Making this requirement mandatory was not deemedpractical.n. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.6(c)(4) and (e). Clarify when the 30 daytime limit begins. Recommend a 90 day contractor response time and a tenpage limit.<T3>Response: </T3>Clarified to state that comments are due 30 days fromthe date of the transmittal letter and that comments received after the30 day period should not be incorporated into the final CPAR. The additionaltime and space requested for contractor response would result in a lengthyprocess (150 days to complete) which produces an unmanageably large report.The goal is a clear and concise report.o. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.9. The matter of confidentiality of the CPARdata relating to contractor performance is very important. Examinationof the FOIA releasability issue is strongly recommended.<T3>Response: </T3>AFSC is equally concerned about the protection of thesensitive and confidential data gathered on the CPAR. The rule discussesat length the requirements for internal and external protection of thedata. Each FOIA request must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis; however,the rule has been amended to establish a central focal point for the command(HQ AFSC/PK) to consider and review CPAR FOIA requests.p. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.9(b). The requirement for a letter, signedby the company CEO, to obtain one's own CPAR data is unduly restrictivefor large multi-business companies. Provisions should be made for delegatingsuch access authority to contractor's representatives who have commitmentauthority such as divisional general managers, vice presidents of contractmanagement, etc.<T3>Response: </T3>Revised to allow CEOs to designate other corporate approvalofficials.q. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.10(a) Item 1. Recommend adding the DefenseActivity Address Directory Code to clearly identify the contractor.<T3>Response: </T3>Added.r. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.10(h) Item 10. Recommend segregating thecontract specific description from the overall program description block.Additional space should be provided for the contract effort description.Detailed descriptions of both the program and contract effort will assistthe source selection teams in their task of determining if the work assessedby the CPAR is relevant to their source selection.<T3>Response: </T3>Revised as requested. This resulted in a renumberingof items in andSection; 838.10.s. <T3>Comment: </T3>Sections 838.10(i)(1) and (i)(3)(i)(C). Will subcontractactions highlighted by the program manager or the prime contractor be reflectedin the subcontractors CPAR file? Please clarify.<T3>Response: </T3>No. The subcontractor actions are only highlighted inthe narrative section of the form when they significantly affect the overallcontract performance. While the program manager must consider the effectsof good or bad performance by a subcontractor, the prime contractor stillremains responsible for overall contract performance. Subcontractor performance,per se, will not be assessed; however, the prime's ability to manage subcontracts(i.e, item 14h subcontract management) will be assessed.t. <T3>Comment: </T3>Section 838.10(i)(3)(v)(B) Item 11E-2. The managementresponsiveness area inappropriately evaluates the contractor's ``willingnessto negotiate fair and reasonable prices and terms and conditions.'' Thisappears to be a punitive evaluation against any contractor who would takeexception to the government's offered position and would lend itself toa subjective evaluation. Recommend deletion of such a description.<T3>Response: </T3>Deleted.The Department of the Air Force has determined that this is not a majorrule as defined by Executive Order 12291, is not subject to the relevantprovisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354),and does not contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements under thecriteria of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 Pub.

The CPAR can be used toeffectively communicate contractor strengths and weaknesses to source selectionofficials. The CPAR will not be used for any purpose other than the onein this paragraph.(b) The CPAR assesses a contractor's positive and negative performanceon a given contract during a specific period of time. Each assessment mustbe based on objective facts and be supportable by program and contractmanagement data, such as cost performance reports, technical interchangemeetings, financial solvency assessments, production management reviews,contractor operations reviews, functional performance evaluations and earnedcontract incentives. Subjective assessments concerning the causes or ramificationsof the contractor's performance should be provided; however, speculationor conjecture should not be included.(c) The CPAR assessment process is designed with a series of checks andbalances to facilitate the objective and consistent evaluation of contractorperformance. Both government and contractor program management perspectivesare captured on the form. The assessment is reviewed by a level of managementabove the program director or manager to ensure consistency with otherCPAR evaluations throughout the product division and other internal reviewsand evaluations of the program, such as command assessment reviews (CAR)and program assessment reviews (PAR).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 838.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability and scope.</ITAG>(a) This part applies to Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) Armament Division,Aeronautical Systems Division, Ballistic Missile Office, Electronic SystemsDivision, and Space Division. The CPAR is limited to contracts for conceptdemonstration and validation, full-scale development (FSD), or full-rateproduction and deployment efforts. Laboratory (science and technology programs),service, and operations and maintenance efforts are not included. A CPARmust be completed on all such contracts over $5 million (face value, excludingunexercised options) with any division or subsidiary of the contractors.When a single contract instrument requires segregation of costs for combiningFSD and production efforts or containing multiple productions lots, anindividual CPAR may be completed for each segment of work.(b) Broadening the application of CPARs by a local activity to additionalcontract efforts and contractors requires AFSC/CV approval before implementation.<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Responsibilities Assigned</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 838.3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">HQ AFSC responsibilities.</ITAG>(a) Deputy Chief of Staff, Systems (HQ AFSC/SD) ensures that the overallmanagement and control of the CPARs is consistent with this part.

Instructions for completing a CPAR arein andSection; 838.10.(b) An intermediate CPAR will be completed on an annual basis for the entireperiod of performance of the contract. More frequent reporting is requiredwhen the program director or manager is aware of a change in performancethat significantly alters the assessment of the contractor or when a changein program directors or managers occurs. Contractors may request that theCPAR be updated by the program office if a significant change in performancehas occurred. Generally, no more than two CPARs a year should be prepared.An intermediate CPAR is limited to contractor performance occurring afterthe preceding CPAR. To improve efficiency in preparing the CPAR, it isrecommended that the CPAR be completed together with other reviews (forexample, PARs, CARs, award fee determinations, major program events, orprogram milestones).(c) A final CPAR will be completed upon contract termination or withinsix months following the delivery of the final major end item on contract.The final CPAR is limited to the contractor performance occuring afterthe preceding CPAR.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 838.6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">CPAR processing.</ITAG>Each CPAR is completed, reviewed, coordinated, and approved within AFSC.Contractor organizations will be given an opportunity to review and commenton the program director's or manager's preliminary assessment. The CPARreview and approval process is as follows:(a) The project manager or engineer responsible for the contract beingreviewed prepares the preliminary documentation and assessment in coordinationwith the project team. This assessment should be based on multifunctionalinput. Support contractors, such as system engineering and technical assistanceor federal contract research center contractors, may provide input as projectteam members but are not allowed access to completed CPARs unless specificallyauthorized in support of a source selection. The project manager or engineermust ensure that all CPAR documentation and forms are marked ``For OfficialUse Only/Source Selection Sensitive'' according to Part 806 of this chapterand chapter 4 of AFR 70-15.(b) The program director or manager responsible for the overall programreviews and transmits the preliminary CPAR to the contractor. The programdirector or manager must not sign at item 17 until just before submittingthe final assessment to the product division reviewing official. Programdirector or manager narrative remarks are limited to item 16 plus one additionalsingle-spaced typewritten page.(c) The program director or manager will retain a copy of the preliminaryCPAR and transmit the original to his or her counterpart within the contractor'sorganization. Face-to-face meetings with contractor management to discusspreliminary CPAR ratings are strongly recommended. The transmittal lettermust provide the following guidance to the contractor.(1) Protect the preliminary CPAR as a source selection sensitive document.(2) Strictly control access to the preliminary CPAR within the contractororganization.(3) Do not release the preliminary CPAR to persons or entities outsidecontractor control. Do not use the preliminary CPAR data for advertising,promotional material, preaward surveys, proposal submittals, productionreadiness reviews, or other similar purposes.(4) Responses are optional; if provided, they are due within 30 days ofthe date of the transmittal letter and are limited to item 18 plus oneadditional single-spaced typewritten page. This page limit will be strictlyenforced. Additional pages will not be reviewed or included in the CPARdata base. Contractor comments received after the 30 day response periodmay not be included in the final CPAR.(5) Focus comments on the objective portion of the program director's ormanager's narrative and provide views on causes and ramifications of theassessed performance.(d) After receiving and reviewing the contractor comments, the programdirector or manager may revise the preliminary assessment. Revised assessmentsmust be recorded on a new CPAR form that will be attached to the original.Complete items 1 through 5 and mark item 12 ``Revision to CPAR for period(insert period covered by report).'' Indicate revised ratings in items14 or 15 and explain the reasons for the changes made in item 16.(e) After receiving contractor comments or 30 days from the date of thetransmittal letter to the contractor, whichever occurs first, the programdirector or manager will sign item 17 and send the CPAR to the productdivision reviewing official for review and signature according to localprocedures. The product division reviewing official must be at least onelevel above the program director or manager.(f) After the CPAR is completed, the program director or manager will sendthe CPAR and all attachments to the CPAR focal point for input into thecommand-wide data base. No copies of the final CPAR will remain on fileat the program office. Working papers associated with CPAR evaluationsmay be retained but must be protected ``For Official Use Only/Source SelectionSensitive.''(g) All records created under this part will be retained and disposed ofaccording to AFR 12-50.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;838.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">CPAR focal point.</ITAG>Each local activity CPAR focal point will keep original CPARs and all attachmentsin separate files for each corporation. Each corporate file will containseparate files for divisions and subsidiaries. Each CPAR will be retainedfor 5 years, unless the program director or manager requests a longer retentionperiod. For example, a long development program may necessitate longerretention to reflect contractor performance on the entire program. Distributionof CPARs within AFSC will only be made from one field activity CPAR focalpoint to another. Source selection team members must contact their localCPAR focal point for all appropriate CPARs.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;838.8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">AFSC Source Selection Offerors Report (RCS: SYS-PKC(A)8801).</ITAG>To keep the CPAR data base current and reflect the contractors that AFSCevaluates during source selection, an annual listing of offerors is required.The listing must:(a) Reflect offerors on concept demonstration and validation, full-scaledevelopment or full-rate production and deployment source selections over$5 million (face award value, including options) that were completed duringthe previous fiscal year.(b) State the name and address of the contractor division or subsidiary.Identify the parent corporation, if applicable. State number of times contractorsubmitted proposals.(c) Identify additional contractors recommended for inclusion in the database, along with a brief justification.(d) Be submitted to HQ AFSC/PKC annually by October 31.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;838.9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">CPAR markings and protection.</ITAG>All CPAR forms and attachments will be marked ``For Official Use Only/SourceSelection Sensitive.'' CPARs have the unique characteristic of always beingpredecisional in nature. They will always be source selection sensitivebecause they will be in constant use to support ongoing source selections.This predecisional nature of the CPAR is a basis for selections. This predecisionalnature of the CPAR is a basis for requiring that the CPAR data base beprotected from unauthorized disclosure to personnel or entities outsidethe source selection process. It must be noted, however, that CPARs mayalso contain information that is proprietary to the contractor that isthe subject of the report. Information contained on the CPAR such as tradesecrets and confidential commercial or financial data, obtained form thecontractor in confidence, must be protected from unauthorized disclosure.Additionally, CPARs may contain valuable government generated commercialinformation that will be used in the award of government contracts. Suchcommercially valuable government-generated information must be protectedfrom unauthorized disclosure. Based on the confidential nature of the CPAR,the following guidance applies to protection both internal and externalto the government.(a) <T3>Internal government protection. </T3>CPARs must be treated as sourceselection sensitive at all times. The flow of CPARs throughout AFSC insupport of source selections will be controlled by the CPAR focal pointsand transmitted only from one CPAR focal point to another (see AFSC Supplement1 to AFR 70-15 and AFSC Supplement 1 to AFR 70-30). Outside of use in aninstant source selection, information contained on the CPARs must be protectedin the same manner as information contained in completed source selectionfiles (see AFRs 70-15 and 70-30). Information contained on the CPAR maynot be used to support preaward surveys, debarment proceedings or any otherinternal government reviews.(b) <T3>External government protection. </T3>Due to the sensitive and confidentialnature of the CPARs, disclosure of CPAR data to contractors or others outsidethe government is not authorized. An exception to this rule is for thecontractor who is the subject of the CPAR. In this situation, access toreview the completed CPAR will be granted by the CPAR focal point if thecontractor personnel requesting access have a letter signed by their corporatechief executive officer (CEO) or authorized designee (for example, generalmanager or division vice-president) granting disclosure to that individual.When the CEO has designated other corporate approval officials, both theCEO designation letter and CPAR access letter signed by the CEO designeemust be presented to the CPAR focal point. Copies of the final CPAR arenot allowed to be made or retained by the contractor's representative.Such limited and controlled access by the contractor's representative willnot inhibit candid agency decision making. This access is needed to ensurethe accuracy of changes made to the CPAR after the contractor's initialreview.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>During the source selection discussion process, the contractorwill be notified of relevant past performance data, derived from a CPARor other sources, that requires clarification or could lead to a negativerating.

It is important to address the complexity ofthe contract effort and the overall technical risk associated with accomplishingthe effort. (j) <T3>Item 14: </T3>Evaluation areas. (1) <T3>Introduction. </T3>In preparing the CPAR, the program director or managershould strive for consistency between the ratings used for the areas ofevaluation on this form and the similar areas used for the PAR, CAR, programdirector assessment report (PDAR), or program manager assessment report(PMAR). The major difference is the CPAR assesses a contractor's performanceon an individual contract while the PAR, CAR, PDAR and PMAR assess theoverall program. A blue rating has been added to denote exceptional performancewhich is not found in the other assessments. This new rating is added becauserecognition of exceptional ability is important in the source selectionprocess. Each area assessment must be based on objective data that willbe provided in item 16. Facts to support specific areas of evaluation shouldbe obtained from the government specialists familiar with the contractor'sperformance on the contract under review. Such specialists may, for example,be from engineering, contracting, contract administration, manufacturing,quality, and logistics. The amount of risk inherent in the effort shouldbe recognized as a significant factor and taken into account when assessingthe contractor's performance. For example, if a contractor met an extremelytight schedule, a blue (exceptional) assessment may be given in recognitionof the inherent schedule risk. The CPAR is designed to assess prime contractorperformance. However, in those evaluation areas where subcontractor actionshave significantly influenced the prime contractor's performance in a negativeor positive way, record the subcontractor actions in item 16. Many of theevaluation areas in item 14 represent groupings of diverse elements. Theprogram director or manager should consider each element and use the arearating to highlight significant issues. For example, product assurance(item 14d) could be rated marginal if quality is a problem even thoughother elements within the product assurance definition were satisfactory.(2) <T3>Evaluation colors_</T3>(i) <T3>Blue_Exceptional. </T3>Indicates performance clearly exceeds contractualrequirements. The area of evaluation contains few minor problems for whichcorrective actions appear highly effective. In the cost performance area,blue indicates a positive cost variance. (ii) <T3>Green_Satisfactory. </T3>Indicates performance clearly meets contractualrequirements. The area of evaluation contains some minor problems for whichthe corrective actions appear satisfactory. In the cost performance area,green indicates no cost variance or a negative cost variance greater thanzero but less than or equal to 5 percent. (iii) <T3>Yellow_Marginal. </T3>Indicates performance meets contractual requirements.The area of evaluation contains a serious problem for which correctiveactions have not yet been identified, appear only marginally effective,or have not been fully implemented. In the cost performance area, yellowindicates a negative cost variance greater than 5 percent but less thanor equal to 15 percent. (iv) <T3>Red_Unsatisfactory. </T3>Indicates the contractor is in danger of notbeing able to satisfy contractual requirements and recovery is not likelyin a timely manner. The area of evaluation contains serious problems forwhich the corrective actions appear ineffective. In the cost performancearea, red indicates a negative cost variance greater than 15 percent. (3) <T3>Arrows. </T3>Upward or downward arrows may be used to indicate an improvingor worsening trend insufficient to change the assessment status. (4) <T3>NA. </T3>Areas not applicable to a particular contract.(k) <T3>Item 14A: Product/system performance. </T3>This item must be scoredseparately. Evaluate the extent to which the contractor is meeting overallproduct or system performance in terms of the contract requirements, includingbut not limited to the statement of work, specifications, contract datarequirement lists, and significant special contract clauses.(1) <T3>Item 14A-1: Engineering design/support. </T3>Evaluate the contractor'sengineering design capability and engineering resource support. Considerthe amount and quality of engineering resources devoted to supporting thecontract effort.(2) <T3>Item 14A-2: Software development. </T3>Evaluate the extent to whichthe contractor is meeting the software development, modification, or maintenancecontract requirements or a government-approved software development plan.Consider the amount and quality of software development resources devotedto support the contract effort.(l) <T3>Item 14B: Schedule. </T3>Evaluate the contractor's adherence to thecontract schedule. Identify in item 16 the major milestones, deliverableitems, or significant data items which contribute to the schedule evaluation.The short narrative explanation in item 16 should address significanceof items, discuss causes, and evaluate effectiveness of contractor correctiveactions. If CPR or C/SSR data are available and the schedule variance exceeds15 percent (positive or negative), briefly discuss in item 16 the significanceof this variance for the contract effort. Cumulative schedule variancein dollars is defined as budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) minus budgetedcost of work scheduled (BCWS)_ Percent schedule variance is defined as((BCWP-BCWS)/BCWS) x 100.(m) <T3>Item 14C: Cost performance. </T3>If CPR or C/SSR data are available,evaluate current cost variance if the contract is greater than 10 percentcomplete. Put the current percent variance and government estimate at completionin item 15 and give a short narrative explanation of causes and contractor-proposedsolutions in item 16. Calculations. See item 8 to calculate percent complete.Compute current cost variance percentage by dividing cumulative cost varianceto date (column 11 of the CPR, Column 6 of the C/SSR) by cumulative BCWPand multiplying by 100. Compute completion cost variance percentage bydividing CBB less government's estimate at completion by CBB and multiplyingby 100. The CBB must be the current budget base against which the contractoris performing (including formally established overtarget baselines (OTB)).If an OTB has been established since the last CPAR, a brief descriptionin item 16 of the nature and magnitude of the baseline adjustment mustbe provided. Subsequent CPARs must evaluate cost performance in terms ofthe revised baseline and reference the CPAR which described the baselineadjustment. For example: ``The contract baseline was formally adjustedon (date). See CPAR for (period covered by CPAR) for an explanation.''If CPR data or C/SSR data are not available, evaluate contractor cost management.Is the contractor experiencing cost growth? Underrun? Provide a short narrativeexplanation in item 16 of causes and the contractor's proposed solutions.(n) <T3>Item 14D: Product assurance. </T3>Product Assurance is the collectionof disciplines needed to design, test, and manufacture systems or equipmentmeeting specified requirements and suitable for intended use. The productassurance assessment evaluates adequacy of contractor organization, resourcesplanning, design, manufacturing and test actions to meet system or equipmentreliability, maintainability cost, and quality requirements with minimumrisk.(o) <T3>Item 14E: Test and evaluation. </T3>Evaluate the adequacy of the contractor'sperformance in planning, supporting, conducting, and assessing the inhouseand independent test and evaluation programs.(p) <T3>Item 14F: ILS program. </T3>Evaluate the adequacy of the contractor'sperformance in accomplishing integrated logistics support (ILS) programtasks and in performing logistics support analysis (LSA) activities. Thenine ILS element groupings are maintenance planning; manpower and personnel;supply support; support equipment; technical data; training and support;computer resources support; facilities, packaging, handling, storage, andtransportation; and design interface.(q) <T3>Item 14G: Management responsiveness. </T3>Evaluate the adequacy ofthe contractor's responsiveness. Address issues such as the timelinessand quality of problem identification, corrective action plans, and proposalsubmittals.(r) <T3>Item 14H: Subcontract management. </T3>Evaluate the contractor's effortdevoted to managing subcontracts. Consider efforts taken to ensure earlyidentification of subcontract problems and the timely application of corporateresources to preclude subcontract problems from impacting overall primecontract performance.(s) <T3>Item 14I: Other. </T3>Specify any additional evaluation areas thatare unique to the contract. If the contract contains an award fee, enter``award fee'' in this item and list all the award fee percentages earnedduring the evaluation period under ``N/A.''(t) <T3>Item 15: Variances. </T3>If CPR or C/SSR data are available, identifythe cumulative cost variance to date (percent); the government's cost estimateat completion (percent); and the cumulative schedule variance (percent).See item 14B and 14C for calculations.(u) <T3>Item 16: Program manager/director's narrative. </T3>A short, factualnarrative statement is required for all assessments regardless of colorrating. Cross-reference the comments in item 16 to rated evaluation areasin item 14. Each narrative statement in support of the area assessmentmust contain objective data. An exceptional cost performance assessmentcould, for example, cite the former underrun dollar value and estimateat completion. A marginal engineering design/support assessment could,for example, be supported by information concerning personnel changes.Key engineers familiar with the effort may have been replaced by less experiencedengineers. Sources of data include Air Force Operational Test and EvaluationCenter operational test and evaluation results; technical interchange meetings;production readiness reviews; earned contract incentives; or award feeevaluations.(v) <T3>Item 17: Program manager/director signature block. </T3>This is signedafter contractor review and just prior to sending it to product divisionreview official.(w) <T3>Item 18: Contractor comments (contractor's option). </T3>See andSection;838.6(c) for guidance on sending the CPAR to the contractor for reviewand comment.(x) <T3>Item 19: Contractor representative signature block.</T3>(y) <T3>Item 20: Review by product division reviewing official. </T3>The reviewingofficial must be at least one level above the program director or manager.This individual will be designated by local procedures.(z) <T3>Item 21: Product division reviewing official signature block.</T3><ITAG tagnum="6">Patsy J.
