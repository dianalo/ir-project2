Cogeneration is defined as the combined production of usefulthermal energy and electric power from a single fuel source. The basiccogeneration cycles can be classified into two types depending on whetherelectrical or thermal energy is produced first. A topping cycle systemfirst produces electrical power and the waste heat is then used for thermalenergy. A bottoming cycle system has thermal energy produced first fora process use and exhaust heat recovered to generate low pressure steamfor the production of electricity. These are only found when an industrialprocess needs high temperature heat. Following an explanation of cogenenerationevolution in the USA, the author provides some applications of cogenerationin the industrial and commercial sectors. A facility studied and installedat the Indiana University of Pennsylvania is described as a cogenerationproject example. 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
