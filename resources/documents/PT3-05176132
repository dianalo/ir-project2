The device includes a supply of the medicament in the form of a      compacted body of powered medicament, a rotatable helical blade which      abrades a desired quantity of the medicament from the compacted body, and      a mouthpiece through which the abraded powder can be inhaled by the user      of the device. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAR>  This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/531,254,      filed May 31, 1990 now abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAR>  This invention relates to a device for the administration of powdered      medicaments by inhalation, more particularly to a multiple-dose device      with metering means for the dispensing of doses from a medicament      reservoir, and also to medicament formulations for use therein. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The administration by inhalation of medicaments in dry powder form is well      known. Devices for the metering and dispensing of measured doses of      medicament from a reservoir have also been described previously (for      example in UK Patent No. 2041763). Such devices typically comprise a      medicament reservoir and a metering chamber with a volume chosen such      that, when filled, the chamber contains the desired weight of medicament      for one dose. Filling of the metering chamber is generally accomplished      under the influence of gravity, the chamber typically being located at the      bottom of the reservoir. Such devices have the disadvantage that      variations in the density of the metered powder can easily occur resulting      in inaccurate or inconsistent dosing. The packing density of the powder      may also depend on the weight of powder remaining in the reservoir,      leading to a gradual reduction in the dose delivered by the device. In      addition, the dose metered is strongly dependent on the orientation of the      device. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, when the medicament to be administered is hygroscopic, great      care must be taken to ensure that water does not contaminate the      medicament because this may cause lumps of medicament to form which can      clog the device and lead to inconsistent dosing. The problem of water      uptake by hygroscopic medicaments is overcome to some extent by supplying      them in gelatin capsules which are punctured immediately prior to      administration in a suitable device (for example the device of UK Patent      1122284). However, a fresh capsule must be inserted into the device for      each dose, and the volume occupied by a month's supply of capsules is      considerable. In addition, such devices have the further disadvantage that      their performance is dependent upon the relative humidity of the      atmosphere in which they are used, i.e., the quality of the cloud (the      proportion of particles in the cloud which are fine enough to penetrate      deep into the lung) decreases as the relative humidity increases.      Furthermore, if the gelatin capsules are stored in an atmosphere of high      relative humidity, they become soft and consequently difficult to handle. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  We have now found that these disadvantages can be overcome or substantially      mitigated by the use of a metering means which relies not on gravitational      force to fill a metering chamber, but on abrasion of a compacted body of      powdered medicament. </PAR><PAR>  Thus, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is      provided a device for the administration by inhalation of a medicament in      powdered form, comprising a medicament reservoir and metering means for      dispensing a dose of medicament from the reservoir, characterized in that      the reservoir comprises a compacted body of powdered medicament and the      metering means includes means for abrading the compacted body. </PAR><PAR>  By &quot;compacted body of powdered medicament&quot; we mean a body of medicament      produced by compressing a sample of loose powder so that the medicament      particles hold together. The degree of compaction obtained will clearly      depend upon the compression force applied to the sample of loose powder,      and the term &quot;compacted body of powdered medicament&quot; includes compacted      bodies of medicament ranging from those that are loosely compacted to      those that are tightly compacted. </PAR><PAR>  A loosely compacted body of medicament may be obtained by applying a      pressure of, for example, from 1.times.10.sup.4 to 15.times.10.sup.4      Nm.sup.-2 to a sample of loose powder (for example a compression force as      might be applied by biasing means in certain embodiments of the first      aspect of the present invention), and the degree of compaction would be      insufficient for such bodies to retain their structural integrity upon      handling. </PAR><PAR>  A tightly compacted body of medicament may be obtained by applying a      pressure of, for example, from 30.times.10.sup.4 to 150.times.10.sup.4      Nm.sup.-2 to a sample of loose powder (for example a compression force as      might be applied by a small hydraulic press), and the degree of compaction      would be sufficient for such bodies to retain their structural integrity      upon handling. </PAR><PAR>  The medicament may consist solely of an active ingredient, for example a      hygroscopic drug. Active ingredients which may be mentioned include sodium      cromoglycate, nedocromil sodium, salbutamol and terbutaline. We prefer the      medicament to additionally comprise an inert carrier, especially in the      case of tightly compacted bodies of medicament, because this results in      improved compaction and dispersion characteristics. Suitable inert      carriers include sugars, for example lactose. When an inert carrier is      present we prefer the particle size of the carrier to be larger than that      of the active ingredient. Suitable particle sizes for the active      ingredient when in loose powder form are from 1 to 10 .mu.m. </PAR><PAR>  Formulations of the medicament which may be mentioned include a mixture of      any one of the above-mentioned active ingredients in association with      lactose, the proportions of carrier to active ingredient depending upon      the particular substances present. For example, we have found that a 1:1      mixture of nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate with lactose is      advantageous. </PAR><PAR>  Tightly compacted bodies of powdered inhalation medicament are novel and      form a second aspect of the present invention. This second aspect of the      invention also includes compacted bodies comprising more than one active      ingredient, and compacted bodies comprising more than one inert carrier. </PAR><PAR>  The compacted body of inhalation medicament may have any convenient      external shape, for example cylindrical or brick-like, and in the case of      a loosely compacted body will generally be determined by the inner      configuration of the medicament reservoir. </PAR><PAR>  Desirably, the means for abrading includes a blade which cuts, scrapes or      otherwise erodes a surface of the compacted body by relative rotation or      sliding between them. For example, the blade may have a helical shape, in      which case the dose abraded from the compacted body of medicament will      depend upon the pitch of the helix, the diameter of the blade, the density      of the compacted body, and the angle through which the blade is rotated.      Thus, when the device is provided with a helical blade, we prefer it to be      further provided with blade rotation control means, for example a ratchet      which will only permit rotation through a predetermined angle for each      dose. </PAR><PAR>  The compacted body may be moved towards the abrading means by a      predetermined distance to permit the correct amount of medicament to be      removed for one dose. This movement may be achieved by screw means (for      example a mechanism similar to that used in lipsticks or glue in stick      form) or by biasing means such as a spring urging the compacted body      towards the abrading means. Alternatively, the compacted body may be fixed      and the abrading means may move towards it. </PAR><PAR>  The inner surfaces of devices according to the first aspect of the      invention which are in contact with the compacted body of medicament (for      example the abrading means and the interior of the reservoir) may      advantageously be coated with a friction reducing agent, for example PTFE      (polytetrafluoroethene). </PAR><PAR>  We prefer devices according to the first aspect of the invention to include      a through-going pathway connecting an air inlet with an air outlet, for      example a mouthpiece such that, in use, a metered dose of medicament is      deposited in the through-going pathway and is then inhaled by a patient      inhaling at the air outlet. </PAR><PAR>  We have also found a particular arrangement of air passageways (referred to      herein as `cyclone means`) which is especially useful in inhalation      devices according to the first aspect of the present invention and also in      other devices for the administration of powdered inhalation medicaments.      Such cyclone means have been found to help improve the quality of the      medicament cloud delivered to a patient. Thus, according to a third aspect      of the present invention there is provided a device for the administration      by inhalation of a medicament in powdered form, comprising a through-going      pathway including a chamber within which entrained medicament may      circulate, wherein the inlet from the pathway to the chamber is tangential      to the chamber wall and orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the      chamber, and the outlet from the chamber is situated on the longitudinal      axis of the chamber so that entrained medicament is preferentially removed      through the outlet from the central zone of the chamber, characterized in      that the inlet passageway includes a venturi adjacent to the junction of      the inlet passageway with the chamber. </PAR><PAR>  When cyclone means are used in association with devices according to the      first aspect of the present invention, the metered dose is preferably      deposited in the through-going pathway upstream from the inlet to the      chamber. A patient then inhales through a mouthpiece communicating with      the outlet from the chamber and thus inhales the medicament which is      entrained in the resulting airstream. Such cyclone means have the      advantage that the finer particles in a particle population are selected      for inhalation. They also cause the bolus of entrained powder to be spread      out more evenly so that the dose of medicament is inhaled over a longer      period of time. </PAR><PAR>  Other means for improving the quality of the medicament cloud which may be      provided in the through-going pathway include grids, propellers and vanes      through which air and entrained medicament pass. </PAR><PAR>  The devices of the present invention overcome the disadvantages of prior      art devices in that a month's supply of medicament occupies a much smaller      volume than, for example, an equivalent number of gelatin capsules. In      addition, we have surprisingly found that the quality of the medicament      cloud produced by devices of the present invention charged with compacted      bodies of medicament according to the second aspect of the invention is      not affected by the relative humidity of the atmosphere in which they are      used, the performance remaining comparable with, and in some cases      superior to the device of UK Patent 1122284 when it is operated in an      atmosphere of low relative humidity. We have also unexpectedly found that      such devices may be stored in an atmosphere of high relative humidity      without adversely affecting the quality of the medicament cloud eventually      obtained from them. </PAR><PAR>  Further, the devices of the present invention have the advantage that they      are very simple to use, in some embodiments a twist of the      medicament-compact holding chamber being all that is required before      inhaling through the mouthpiece. Also, the dosing consistency is much      greater than is found with devices in which filling of a metering chamber      is accomplished under the influence of gravity (as in the device of UK      Patent No 2041763). In addition they do not have the disadvantage that      actuation of the device must be synchronized with inhalation as with      pressurized aerosol devices. </PAR><PAR>  Although the invention has been described for use in oral inhalation of      medicaments, it is also suitable for the administration of nasal      medicaments by inhalation. The necessary adaptation for this mode of      administration will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. </PAR><PAR>  The devices of the present invention may be designed for limited use (i.e.,      supplied with an integral compacted body of medicament and discarded when      that is exhausted), or to be reusable (i.e., replacement compacted bodies      may be inserted). </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by      way of example, with reference to the following drawings, in which      corresponding features are given the same reference numeral: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an inhalation device according to the first      aspect of the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is vertical cross sectional view of the of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2a is a partial sectional view on an expanded scale along the line      2a-2a of FIG. 2 showing a ratchet mechanism which limits the rotation of      the helical blade shown in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the medicament reservoir and metering means      of the device of FIG. 1, partly cut away; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is an alternative embodiment of a device according to the first      aspect of the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a schematic view of an arrangement of air passageways in a device      according to the third aspect of the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a lateral cross sectional view of the arrangement of FIG. 5 in      the plane VI--VI-VI; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a vertical cross sectional view of a device incorporating the      first and third aspects of the invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Referring first to FIGS. 1 and 2, a device according to the first aspect of      the invention comprises a lower body portion 1, and an upper body portion      2 which encloses a medicament reservoir 3. </PAR><PAR>  Lower body portion 1 defines a tubular chamber 4 having an opening 5 in a      mouthpiece portion. Air inlets 6 are provided in the wall of lower body      portion 1 opposite opening 5. </PAR><PAR>  Upper body portion 2 is generally cylindrical and is rotatably mounted on      lower body portion 1 over a second opening therein by an axial shaft      portion 7 having a flanged end 8 which is received by a socket 9 provided      in the lower wall of lower body portion 1. </PAR><PAR>  Medicament reservoir 3 is also generally cylindrical, and is slidably      mounted in upper body portion 2. Shaft 7 passes axially through reservoir      3 and also through an axial bore formed in a cylindrical block of tightly      compacted medicament 10 which is situated in reservoir 3. </PAR><PAR>  A helical blade 11 is attached to shaft 7 towards the middle of its length      and extends radially to the inner wall of reservoir 3. The edge of blade      11 describes an arc of approximately 350.degree., and a further air inlet      12 is positioned between the leading and trailing edges of blade 11. Air      inlet 12 communicates with an external opening 14 situated in the center      of the upper face of upper body portion 2 via passageway 15 which runs      axially through shaft 7. </PAR><PAR>  The block of compacted medicament 10 is urged towards blade 11 by spring 13      which acts against the inner wall of upper body portion 2 and the outer      wall of reservoir 3. </PAR><PAR>  To use the device, upper body portion 2 is rotated through 45.degree.,      further rotation being prevented by a ratchet mechanism shown in FIG. 2a,      resulting in blade 11 cutting into block of medicament 10 and abrading the      quantity of medicament required for one dose. Some of the abraded      medicament is deposited in lower body portion 1, and some remains between      the leading and trailing edges of blade 11. A patient then inhales through      opening 5, causing air to be drawn in through inlets 6 and opening 14,      resulting respectively in medicament being entrained from lower body      portion 1 and from between the leading and trailing edges of blade 11. The      entrained medicament is then inhaled by the patient. </PAR><PAR>  It will be appreciated that upper body portion 1 is stabilized by the wall      of medicament reservoir 3 sliding telescopically over a peripheral wall 16      formed around the second opening in lower body portion 1 as the block of      medicament 10 is abraded. If necessary, cooperating vertical tongues and      grooves may be provided on the inner and outer faces of the wall of      medicament reservoir 3 and peripheral wall 16 in order to prevent relative      rotation between them, which would reduce the effectiveness of blade 11. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 4, an alternative embodiment resembles that of FIG.      1, except that medicament reservoir 3 is moved towards blade 11 by the      action of a screw thread 17 formed on the upper portion of shaft 7 upon      which the upper opening of medicament reservoir 3 is threaded. The length      of block 10 abraded by blade 11 as it turns through a certain angle      coincides with the distance which medicament reservoir 3 is moved down      shaft 7 by the action of screw thread 17. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 5 and 6, a device according to the third aspect of      the invention comprises a body 18 provided with an air inlet 19 which      communicates via an inlet passageway 20 with a cylindrical chamber 21 into      which the inlet passageway 20 empties tangentially; an outlet passageway      22 situated on the longitudinal axis of the chamber, the diameter of the      outlet passageway's opening being about one third that of the chamber; and      a mouthpiece 23 situated at the end of the outlet passageway. Inlet      passageway 20 is orthogonal to outlet passageway 22. Adjacent to the      junction of inlet passageway 20 with chamber 21, there is a local      constriction (venturi) 24 in the inlet passageway. </PAR><PAR>  To use the device illustrated in the drawings, a dose of medicament is      deposited in inlet passageway 20 (by means not shown) adjacent to air      inlet 19. A patient then inhales through mouthpiece 23 which causes air to      be drawn into inlet passageway 20. The inhaled stream of air entrains the      medicament, which then passes into cylindrical chamber 21 from which it      leaves through outlet passageway 22 and is then delivered to the patient's      mouth through mouthpiece 23. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 7, an inhalation device comprises the features of the      device shown in FIG. 1 with the arrangement of air passageways shown in      FIG. 5 being incorporated into lower body portion 1. In use, a dose of      medicament is abraded from block of medicament 10 and deposited in inlet      passageway 20. A patient then inhales at mouthpiece 23. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
