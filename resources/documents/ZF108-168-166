 But Artisoft, a Tuscon, Ariz., software company, isshowing signs of a breakthrough.andP;  It has introduced several versions of itsLAN-tastic Network Operating System for customers who require something lessthan a dedicated file server.andP;  And, it does so without demandingback-breaking prices in speed, memory or coin of the realm.andM;Artisoft is not the first to recognize the void, and the commensurateopportunities, in the small-office market.andP;  TeleVideo had tried, and almostmade a go of it, in 1984.andP;  It had offered a small file server, the PersonalMini, bundled with cables, network-interface cards and the Infoshare networksoftware--an early version of Novell's NetWare.andP;  It wasn't very successful,partly because the market for small networks hadn't yet developed.andM;Growth of a marketandM;That the void should still exist is surprising.andP;  It isn't a smallmarket--every PC reseller has a handful of these customers: typically anoffice that starts out tentatively, buying a personal computer and adot-matrix printer.andP;  You also sell them a decent word processing program, afiler and perhaps a spreadsheet.andM;Once comfortable with that first PC, and now convinced of its benefits, theycome back for another and this time, please, a desktop laser printer.andP;  Soonthe office hands are spoiled by the efficiency of word processing and thespeed of the laser printer, and the complications begin--because you can'tsell this kind of customer a third, fourth and fifth PC, without there beinga reasonably economical way to let staffers share that laser printer.andM;At the least, they will need a &quot;smart&quot; printer switch, a four- or five-inputdevice capable of routing and buffering the data from each of the PCs to theprinters.andP;  Such switches aren't cheap--switch/buffers typically sell for $700to $1,200--nor are they elegant.andM;The better solution is a real network--we all know that.andP;  With a network,each computer can not only share printers but can also use electronic mail,share files and run multiuser software.andP;  In fact, most offices willeventually need a real network anyway.andM;A complex approachandM;For most dealers the choice will be Novell's NetWare.andP;  For maturity ofsystem, robust behavior, widespread industry support, features, lowworkstation-RAM overhead--NetWare is tough to beat.andM;But for the small-office market, NetWare doesn't fit.andP;  Even though these arelower priced, limited-user versions (the four-user ELS I and eight-user ELSII), they are just as complex as their larger siblings--and there is anarchitectural problem.andP;  NetWare requires a file server; how do you convincean office manager with five PCs that they now need that $4,000&quot;accessory&quot;--along with five interface cards for $2,000 and a $1,000operating system--just to hook the PCs together?andM;Novell has tried to ameliorate the expense by permitting NetWare to beconfigured for non-dedicated server operation.andP;  This allows the expensiveserver to simultaneously be used as a network workstation, saving the priceof one PC.andP;  But I don't recommend it.andP;  If the operator of thatserver/workstation causes it to hang, this can bring down the whole network,even to the extent of forcing other workstations that were simply logged intothe network, to reboot.andM;Plus there is the support problem.andP;  No five-PC office is going to hire asystem manager, and, best intentions aside, few office workers ever reach thetechnical proficiency necessary to maintain a Novell, or similar, network.andO;That means they need to call in the dealer, or some other consultant, atleast three or four times a year, at $50 to $150 per hour.andM;What is really needed in this environment is a peer-to-peer network: anarchitecture where there is no file server--eliminating that extraexpense--and in which each networked computer can act as both server andworkstation.andP;  Thus, any computer can access the facilities (hard disks,printers, modems, etc.) of any other computer on the network.andM;But there is a downside in both speed and memory-overhead.andP;  Since each PCthat acts as a server on the network &quot;shares&quot; its resources with otherworkstations, it runs more slowly than it would as a workstation only.andP;  Andsince any computer acting simultaneously as a server and a workstation musthave memory-resident software drivers for both functions, less memory isavailable to run applications.andM;Virtually all DOS-based peer-to-peer network products rely on IBM's NetBIOSprotocol.andP;  Without an efficient NetBIOS implementation, this memory-residentsoftware can occupy so much RAM in the workstation/server that it becomesunusable for most software.andP;  In a really bad case, such as IBM's PC LAN, thememory overhead can exceed 350K bytes.andM;And most low-cost peer-to-peer networks use slower, 1M- or 2M-bits-per-secondinterface cards to keep the cost down.andM;In trips the light LANtasticandM;The attractive exception is Artisoft's LANtastic, a NetBIOS-compatiblepeer-to-peer system that typically consumes less than 70K bytes of systemmemory for both workstation and server modules and is available in a versionthat runs over conventional 10M-bit-per-second Ethernet cards on conventionalthick or thin coaxial cable.andM;It supports DOS 3.1 file- and record-locking facilities and supports anelaborate array of security-access options, electronic messaging and printersharing; and it uses a command structure similar to Microsoft's MS-NET.andP;  Forexample, the computer in the front office logs on to the network by executinga batch file with the commands: LANBIOS, REDIR FRONTOFF, SHARE and SERVER.andM;Among other things, these memory-resident programs load the NetBIOSimplementation, put the computer on the network as a server with the nameFRONTOFF and implement multiuser file- and record-locking facilities.andM;Network access to FRONTOFF's D:\BOOKS\INV DATA subdirectory is gained byrunning the NET MGR program to give this subdirectory, for example, thenetwork name INVOICES.andP;  Another computer can then assign (map) one of itsfree drive letters, say, E:, to that subdirectory with the command: NET USEE: \\FRONTOFF\INVOICES.andM;Henceforth, all files sent to or from the workstation's E: drive will, infact, be sent across the network to the D:\BOOKS\INV DATA subdirectory of theFRONTOFF machine.andP;  And, after a workstation issues the command: NET USE LPT2:\\FRONTOFF\@HPLASER, any print job sent to its 1pt2 port will print on thelaser printer attached to the computer in the front office.andM;The system is not as fast as a heavyweight network installation.andP;  With fourserver/workstations logged in, actual throughput is roughly one-half of whata dedicated-server NetWare/Ethernet system offers, but this is still veryusable.andP;  And it's economical: A complete two-user startup system with two8-bit Artisoft Ethernet cards, a 25-foot coaxial cable and the operatingsystem retails for $725.andP;  Additional cards retail for $350.andM;For those willing to tolerate lower speeds, Artisoft also offers a version ofthe same operating system, which uses twisted-pair cable and Artisoftproprietary interface cards.andP;  A two-user starter system (cards, cable andsoftware) that operates at 2M bits per second retails for $525 (additionalcards--$249); a similar 700K-bit-per-second system that uses tiny half-lengthand half-height interface cards retails for $325 (additional cards--$149).andM;There is even a two-user version of LANtastic that runs through a PC's serial(115K bps) or parallel (500K bps) ports, without interface cards.andP;  CalledLANtastic Z, it retails, with cables, for $199--about as basic as networkingcan get.andP;  LANtastic Z can co-reside on the same network as regular LANtastic;in fact, LANtastic Z is actually regular LANtastic with port-driver softwarethat makes a PC's serial or parallel port look to the operating system likean interface card.andP;  It's a handy way to hook a laptop that has no expansionslots onto the network.andM;Showing marketplace savvyandM;Artisoft shows an enlightened attitude of coexistence, when it is obviousthat many, if not most, of the dealers it reaches will also be Novellvendors.andM;Ordinarily, I wouldn't recommend carrying an Ethernet card that was supportedby only one LAN vendor, but Artisoft is promising to supply, free of charge,a NetWare driver in case you should want to upgrade a customer to a Novellnetwork and still use the Artisoft Ethernet cards.andM;And LANtastic's workstation and server modules can run in a NetWareworkstation simultaneously with NetWare.andP;  You can put a second Ethernet cardin such a workstation running NetWare, configure it as a LANtasticserver/workstation and have simultaneous access to both networks.andP;  This canalso be done using LANtastic Z through a workstation's serial or parallelport, without a second Ethernet card.andP;  In the future, Artisoft even plans toallow each workstation on the LANtastic side to have direct access to theNetWare file server's disk drives.andM;Moving in wider circlesandM;Artisoft also offers AI- (Adapter Independent) LANtastic ($495), a versionthat runs on any network adapter that includes adequate NetBIOS support.andP;  Theproblem with this is the limited, and often inferior, nature of mostcompanies' NetBIOS implementations.andP;  Because Microsoft MS-NET and IBM's PCLAN have made such a negligible dent in the PC network market, many boardmakers don't bother to supply NetBIOS drivers for their interface cards orthey supply only partial implementations.andP;  AI-LANtastic depends on a fullNetBIOS implementation for satisfactory performance and the company certifiesonly a limited number of NetBIOS-adapter combinations, including units fromEverex Systems and Localnet Communications.andP;  Artisoft also certifies thethird-party NetBIOS implementations done by Performance Technology.andM;For optimal performance, Artisoft is writing its own NetBIOS software forthird-party adapters and selling it for $295 (retail) per network.andP;  Thus far,they have completed versions for the SMC Arcnet card and the Western DigitalWD8003 Ethercard Plus.andM;This is clearly inadequate.andP;  The price of broad-based success in this marketis extensive support of third-party adapters and Artisoft will have to paythe price.andP;  What it needs to do is write optimal NetBIOS implementations fora half-dozen popular cards, such as Novell's, 3Com's, Gateway's, etc., andbundle them with the AI-LANtastic.andM;Direct to dealerandM;Artisoft has chosen to build a dealer network itself, without usingdistributors.andP;  This strategy can work to a dealer's advantage; after all,technical support, often a problem if a manufacturer tries to limit yourcontact to their distributors, should be first-rate when you're granted openaccess to the manufacturer.andP;  On the other hand, if you don't like the qualityof technical support, you can't switch to another source, as is common in theconventional distribution chain.andM;Margins are typical: dealer discounts are based on cumulative purchaseamounts, starting at a base of 30 percent on hardware and 40 percent onsoftware, rising to 40 percent on hardware and 50 percent on software abovethe $10,000 mark.andM;Richard Glidewell, Ph.D, an industry consultant, is the host of MICROCOMPUTERNEWSTAPES.andP;
