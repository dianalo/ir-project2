The chemical composition in a near-surface layer of ZnSe monocrystalchanged so that the forbidden bandwidth of the semiconductor decreasedand overlapped the radioluminescence spectral range. For this purposesolid-phase substitution reaction was used. Heterotransitions were obtainedby ZnSe crystal annealing in tellurium. An X-ray source with about 20keV quanta and a /sub 35/Am/sup 241/ {gamma}-source with about 60 keVquanta were used for exciting scintillations. The S-PD system characteristicswere similar for both excitation methods. From practical viewpoint alinear dependence of photocurrent on radiation dose rate in a wide variationrange (10/sup -4/-10/sup 4/ R/h) is important. The structure sensitivityreaches 10/sup -7/ AxR/sup -1/xh and it is comparable with its valuefor the ''discrete'' pair ZnSe:Te - Si-photodiode conserving all meritsand advantages of the monolithic structure.</TEXT></DOC>
