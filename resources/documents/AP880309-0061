Albert Gore won big in a 12-candidate field and settled forhalf of the Democratic prize.   Bush beat Kansas Sen. Bob Dole by 2 percent, but won in five ofthe six congressional districts, apparently gaining 33 of 36delegates available, while Dole won three delegates and PatRobertson finished third and got none.   ``If Dole can't win in Oklahoma, where can he win?'' said MattSeward, Bush's campaign director in Oklahoma. He said Oklahoma wasone of three states Dole had targeted to win in the 20-state SuperTuesday elections.   Gore captured 41 percent of the vote among 12 candidates, almosttwice that of his nearest rival, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt,but claimed only 23 of the state's 46 delegates up for grabs.   Gephardt, the early frontrunner in Oklahoma, finished second infive districts and claimed 13 delegates. Dukakis got sevendelegates and Jackson received three.   In Republican voting with 2,422 of 2,439 precincts reporting, or99 percent, Bush had 77,938 votes, or 37 percent; Dole had 72,683or 35 percent. Robertson had 44,197, or 21 percent and New YorkCongressman Jack Kemp had 11,018, or 5 percent.   With 2,434 of 2,439 precincts reporting, or 99 percent ofDemocratic returns, Gore had 162,187 votes, or 41 percent; Gephardthad 82,267, or 21 percent; Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis had66,150, or 17 percent, and Jackson had 52,460, or 13 percent.   Bush supporters were hoping today that Tuesday's victory inDole's backyard will prove decisive in derailing the vicepresident's main opponent in the Republican presidentialsweepstakes.   Supporters of Gore said the senator's surprisingly strongvictory in the Sooner State will help the southerner stake a claimas the ``mainstream'' candidate who can return the White House tothe Democratic fold in November.   ``Super Tuesday has proven that Al Gore is the candidate formainstream Democrats,'' said state Sen. Stratton Taylor,co-chairman of the Gore drive in Oklahoma.</TEXT></DOC>
