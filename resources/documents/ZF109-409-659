(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Missing LinksandM;While the use of portable LANs is generally restricted to unique,out-of-the-office, or temporary situations, like the scene of a fire or apolitical convention, the wireless element makes them attractive for rapidlyexpanding companies.andP;  Not only is cable unwieldy, unsightly, and obstructive,but it makes ongoing maintenance difficult.andP;  Installers often don't keepdetailed cabling diagrams, and every inch of physical cable is vulnerable todamage.andM;One solution to cabling woes is not to use cables.andP;  Instead, use wirelessconnections.andP;  There is a trade-off, however, in terms of reliability andperformance.andP;  Since the wireless units rely on radio frequency (RF) spreadspectrum or infrared signals to communicate, interference is always possible.andO;(Microwave, while also a wireless medium, requires equipment too large toqualify it as easily portable.)andP;  Vendors of wireless equipment go to greatlengths to provide extensive error checking; nevertheless, a large co-workerstanding in the wrong place can disrupt a network connection.andM;A question of security also arises.andP;  Anyone with the appropriate receiverdevice can capture the signal transmitted from one unit to another.andO;Encryption is absolutely necessary in an environment where sensitiveinformation is on a network.andP;  Wireless LAN vendors emphasize their securityfeatures, such as implementing transmission in different channels as well asusing encryption.andM;A psychological element must also be overcome.andP;  For every network manager whoembraces wireless technology for its convenience, there is one who shuns itas an impossibility.andP;  There's a certain incredulity factor, even though radioor television transmission are wireless.andM;Spread SpectrumandM;O'Neill Communications (Princeton, N.J.), makers of the Local Area WirelessNetwork (LAWN), provide a low-end wireless system designed for inexperiencedusers who need peripheral sharing, file transfer, and e-mail.andP;  The companyuses spread spectrum signals to transmit data between its LAWN units, whichplug into PC serial ports.andP;  Each unit contains a radio transceiver,processor, and memory.andM;Spread-spectrum technology is used practically everywhere, from garage dooropeners to radio, and it relies on the transmission of electromagnetic waves.andO;The waves are measured by amplitude, which is the height or strength of thewave, and frequency, which is the number of times it oscillates per second.andO;FM radio stations, for example, each transmit at a specific frequency,indicated by their numbers on the radio dial.andM;The signal also requires a certain range in which to operate, so it will notoverlap with other signals.andP;  The greater the range, the higher the availablebandwidth.andP;  While commercial radio stations require 200 KHz bandwidth tooperate, O'Neill's LAWN operates in the 902 MHz to 928 MHz range.andP;  (Radiostations operate in the 88 MHz to 106 MHz range.)andM;Signals using spread-spectrum modulation require a much higher bandwidth thanthe minimum needed to transmit data, because data, as well as a random signalknown only to the sender and receiver, are transmitted.andP;  The user's databecomes altered, resulting in much smaller packets being transmitted, whichrequires a higher bandwidth.andM;Because spread-spectrum technology was originally used for militarycommunications, the encoding and decoding process, while complicated, isstringent.andP;  Also, because the signal is spread over a high bandwidth at lowdensity, it is difficult to detect.andM;Each LAWN network can service about 10,000 square feet, and O'Neill providesfour channels, so individual LAWNs, even in the same office, cannot receiveeach other's transmissions.andP;  There are also 65,000 user-assigned securitycodes that prevent data from being received by a unit without the propersecurity code, further insulating individual LAWN networks within the sameoffice from one another.andP;  LAWN also uses a radio-based version of the X.25protocol, called AX.25.andP;  Under AX.25, any packet sent but not acknowledged isretransmitted, thereby ensuring that all the data intended for transmissionactually reaches its destination.andM;O'Neill emphasizes the low-end aspect of LAWN, recommending between two and20 users per network.andP;  Features are restricted to basic file transfer andprinter sharing, along with e-mail.andP;  A network operating system such asNetWare is not needed, although it may coexist with the LAWN operating systemand applications.andP;  The company claims that a neophyte can set up the systemwithout ever cracking the spine of a manual.andP;  The user interface ismenu-driven, and additional users can be added by attaching their equipmentto the LAWN unit, with the software automatically updating all user lists.andM;O'Neill recently announced a speedier and cheaper version of LAWN.andP;  It nowoperates at 19.2Kbps, and it is priced at $298 per unit.andP;  O'Neill has alsoimproved the user interface and provides third-party serial softwarecompatibility.andM;Telesystems (Don Mills, Ont.) with its Advanced Radio LAN (ARLAN) is also aspread spectrum player.andP;  Instead of self-contained units attached to each PC,as O'Neill has, ARLAN relies on plug-in cards outfitted with radiotransceivers with tiny antennae and stuffed into each PC and the file server.andO;The cards not only operate within an office, but between buildings as well.andO;The ARLAN 400 PC LAN System is designed specifically for industry-standardnetwork operating systems, like NetWare.andM;The cards operate in conjunction with a transceiver that is connected to thefile server over a twisted-pair cable that the company calls an NCBus.andP;  Thecards and transceivers are used at the central file server, where thetransceiver and antenna can be centrally located and elevated to bridge twoexisting network clusters or integrate a standalone workstation into a cablednetwork.andM;ARLAN has a typical range of between 200 to 300 feet within an open office.andO;In large open areas, such as factories, the range can increase up to 1,500feet.andP;  ARLAN also operates between buildings, and depending on antenna type,elevation, and line-of-sight, it can cover several miles.andP;  Like LAWN, ARLAN,is a packet-based system that uses a contention method similar to CSMA.andO;ARLAN operates at a data rate of 230Kbps.andP;  Bandwidth can be increased byusing multiple ARLAN units in parallel, or several file servers, eachsupporting a different cell.andM;Being a full-blown wireless network makes ARLAN more expensive than theentry-level LAWN, but it has many more features.andP;  Each node costs about$1,500.andM;Infrared OptionsandM;Photonics (Campbell, Calif.) takes a different approach to wireless LANs,both in terms of features and technology.andP;  Whereas the LAWN includes networkhardware, a network operating system, and basic applications, Photolink is acable substitute.andP;  Photolink can be used with any type of network software,since it does nothing but replace cabling.andP;  Currently available for LocalTalknetworks and as an RS-232 interface for terminal-to-host communication,Photolink uses reflected infrared light to transmit signals between units.andO;Token Ring and Ethernet versions are due out in 1991.andM;The Photolink unit, which resembles a high-tech hammer, is mounted on aregular office partition, and the head is aimed at a point on the ceiling, orany diffusely reflecting surface.andP;  Each unit is aimed at the same area, withdiagnostic lights on the unit flashing green when aligned correctly.andM;To transmit data between units, a protocol converter encodes the data, usinga proprietary error correction scheme that requires no additional bandwidth,as with spread-spectrum technology.andP;  The encoded data is modulated, the sentto a driver that causes the infrared light-emitting diodes to pulse rapidly.andO;The infrared light passes through a transmitter lens that focuses the beam onan area of the ceiling.andM;The infrared light reflected from the ceiling is collected by the receiverlens on the destination unit and is filtered to remove any extra visiblelight.andP;  A photodiode converts the light into an electrical signal.andP;  Thesignal is amplified and passed through automatic gain control circuitry thatassures all signal levels from all the Photolink units are uniform,regardless of their distance from the reflective area of the ceiling.andP;  ademodulator converts the signal into serial bit stream data that travels to aLAN interface and back out to the LAN.andM;Because of the proprietary error correction scheme, the Photolink unit isrelatively immune to ordinary interference.andP;  The lens can even be partiallyblocked, and the units will continue to transmit, although the speed at whichdata is transferred will be affected.andP;  In the case of prolonged and completeblockage, the user is informed that the connection has been broken.andM;Photonics designed its original units, which can connect up to four deviceseach, to be used within an office, replacing cable throughout a network, orin selected segments.andP;  Recently the company introduced a Building-to-BuildingPhotolink--again in Macintosh and RS-232 versions--that uses infrared lightto connect computers in adjacent buildings up to 600 feet away.andM;The Building-to-Building units are attached to the inside of a window or to awall near the window and almed (through glass) directly at a unit in anotherbuilding.andP;  Just as the workgroup units were designed to replace cable, theBuilding-to-Building units replace expensive and complex fiber, broadbandcable, or wireless media, such as microwave or laser.andM;The workgroup Photoiink unite cost $1,195 each.andP;  The Building-to-Buildingunit costs $1,995.andM;Not content with connecting existing PCs and Macs over wireless media, theAgilis' eponymous workstation is a self-contained, individually configurable,wireless machine, complete with a built-in network interface.andP;  With the othervendors concentrating on providing wireless solutions for an officeenvironment, it's arguably safe to say that the Mountain View, Calif., Agilishas the only truly portable networking solution available today.andM;Designed for the 45 percent of the workforce that does not work in an office,Agilis comes in slices, which are functional components that snap together.andO;Slices are Console, Keypad, Processor, Communications, and Battery, as wellas system software and accessories.andP;  The Agilis allows for multiple 32-bitprocessors per system and grayscale bit-mapped graphics.andP;  RAM slices, up to2MB each, are available, along with hard disks in 20MB or 40MB capacities and3-1/2-inch, 720KB Floppy Storage Slices.andP;  The system also accepts half-sizeexpansion cards.andM;A most useful aspect of the Agilis is built-in Ethernet.andP;  Individual systemscan be networked either via standard coax or spread spectrum, using theAgilis Packet Radio slice.andP;  In wireless mode, the Agilis can transmit up to100 meters indoors and one kilometer outdoors, and offers multiple channelsfor users to choose from.andP;  Agilis includes drivers for Novell NetWare, 3Com's3+, and TCP/IP.andM;R2D2, Where Are You?andM;While robots have been networked in a static fashion in factories for years,mobile robots, like the ones depicted in &quot;Star Wars,&quot; have not been nearly soprevalent.andP;  Three years ago, the computer Science Department Robotics Lab atStanford University started the GOFER project, under the direction ofProfessor Jean-Claude Latombe, specifically for research and development ofmobile communications for robots.andM;The goal of the GOFER project was to develop technology that would allowseveral robots to interact on a single task and interface with human beings.andO;The systems are not only mobile but have sensing, communications, andcomputing capabilities.andP;  The robots could be used for corporate applications,such as greeting and guiding visitors or interoffice package delivery, and inhealth care centers and hotels, where they would be useful in operationssupport, such as fetching supplies for cleaning or repair personnel.andM;Anticipating the potential for mobile robotics in the commercial sector, twograduate students who worked on the GOFER project, Jim Slater and David Zhu,recently spun off the technology into their own company, Nomadic Technologies(Palo Alto, Calif.).andM;According to Slater, Nomadic's president, the Agilis system is used tofacilitate communications among the robots, each of which is a node on anEthernet network.andP;  The robots can communicate with each other or anyone elseon the network.andP;  Slater says the Agilis with its communications sliceprovided the four elements critical to mobile robotics networking:high-bandwidth, robustness, interoperability and, of course mobility.andM;The robots, which are 18 inches in diameter and between 18 inches to two feettall, cost about $20,000, and must be sensitive to their environment.andP;  Theylaser spreads a plane of light, and the camera records any intersection of anobject in the robot's path and the laser field.andP;  The robot also uses audiosensing by sending out a sonic pulse and listening for the echo, a systemsimilar to a range finder on a camera.andP;  Voice recognition is not built intothe robots as yet, although it is being resarched.andM;The Automated SoldierandM;The next centry will see the automated soldier, the newest strategy in combatsince french warfare, if the U.S.andP;  Army's Communications and ElectronicsCommand (CECOM) has its way.andP;  CECOM is in the initial stages of developing aportable system which incorporates the Agilis portable network computer forsoldiers to carry in the field, according to James Schoening, operationsresearch analyst at CECOM.andP;  The system will enable soldiers in the field tocommunicate with commanding officers and upload and download information suchas maps, enemy location, and training modules.andM;&quot;Battlefields are chaotic places,&quot; says Schoening.andP;  &quot;The soldiers will usetheir network to increase the effectiveness of communications in combat.'andM;The research currently underway at CECOM is part of a larger project, theSoldiers Integrated Protective Ensemble (SIPE), being managed at the Army'sResearch, Development, and Engineering Center in Natick, Mass.andP;  CECOM,headquartered at Fort Monmouth, N.J., is responsible for the computer andcommunications element of SIPE, which is scheduled for an initialdemonstration in 1992.andP;  At that demonstration, soldiers will be given severaldays trading and then sant out in the field to test the equipment.andM;Two related programs are underway at CECOM: the Soldier's Computer andSoldier's Radio, which will bring services to each individual soldier.andP;  Apocket-size device weighing about a pound, it could fit on a belth or abackpack and would provide the soldier with various computing abilities,including wireless networking capabilities to transmit voice and data withranges up to 500 meters.andM;One of the unique features of the soldiers equipment is the helmet-mounted,&quot;Heads Up&quot; display.andP;  The tiny display, which has a resolution comparable to aCGA monitor, would be positioned in front of one eye, so soldiers can accessboth text and graphical information while on the move.andM;&quot;Laptops aren't really portable,&quot; comments Schoening, who along with MatthewZieniewicz, the head of the technical integration team, originated anddeveloped the concept.andP;  &quot;The soldier still has to sit down and set it up.andO;With the display, he can be walking or crawling and still accessinformation.&quot;andM;&quot;ECOM also intends to integrate video imaging into the system, so actualpictures of enemy weapons sites, for example, could be accessed on thenetwork.andM;The system will also incorporate a Global Positioning System that will pickup satellite beacon signals, so a soldier's location can be pinpointed within20 feet.andP;  CECOM is working with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Technologyto develop a radio pill which the soldier would actually swallow.andP;  The pill,which would pass through the body in three days, would monitor the soldier'sbody temperature, pulse rate, and the amount of sleep he has had to determineif he is ready for certain missions.andM;Although this kind of technology has long been anticipated in movies like&quot;Aliens,&quot; and &quot;Total Recall,&quot; it is still at least 10 years in the offing.andO;For one thing, the systems are just not lightweight enough to make thempractical for field Use.andP;  The Agilis currently weighs about 12 pounds, farmore than the one-pound target weight.andP;  However, both Agilis and CECOM areconfident that within the next few years, the machine will be small enoughfor the soldiers to tote.andM;In the meantime, the Agilis provides CECOM a platform on which to developthese applications, which will include imaging, voice mail, and livecommunications as well as the other more specific functions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
