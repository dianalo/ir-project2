<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-0255 </DOCNO><TEXT>A nonlinear impact analysis computer program DYNA3D, which was developedby Hallquist, has been introduced from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratoryfor the purpose of using impact analysis of nuclear fuel transport casks.DYNA3D had been built in CASKETSS code system (CASKETSS means a modularcode system for CASK Evaluation code system for Thermal and StructuralSafety). Main features of DYNA3D are as follows; (1) This program hasbeen programmed to provide near optimal speed on vector processing computers.(2) An explicit time integration method is used for fast calculation.(3) Many material models are available in the program. (4) A contact-impactalgorithm permits gap and sliding along structural interfaces. (5) Thegraphic program for representations of calculation is provided. In thepaper, brief illustration of calculation method, input data and samplecalculations are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
