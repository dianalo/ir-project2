(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Gov. Evan Mecham, removed fromoffice last month by impeachment conviction, went on trial Thursdayon criminal charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.   About 100 prospective jurors were sworn in during the briefopening session at Maricopa County Superior Court. Mecham did notattend.   ``I haven't broken any laws,'' he said Wednesday. ``I looked atthe laws. My attorney looked at the laws. We've had experts look atthe laws. We haven't broken any of them.''   Mecham and his brother and 1986 campaign treasurer, WillardMecham, are charged with perjury, willful concealment and filingfalse documents for failing to report a $350,000 campaign loan froma developer.   Mecham, 64, could face up to 22 years in prison if convicted ofall six felony counts. His brother could be sentenced to up to 9{years if convicted of the three counts he faces.   The former governor's attorney, Michael Scott, said Mechamprobably will attend court sessions next week, after the pool ofprospective jurors is narrowed and questioning of individualsbegins.   Thursday, those in the jury pool were given a questionnaireworked out by the prosecution, defense and trial Judge Michael Ryanand designed to identify anyone biased for or against the formergovernor.   ``Please do not withhold any information in order to be seatedon this jury,'' Ryan told the prospective jurors.   Thursday's session lasted about 15 minutes, and the prospectivejurors left as they completed the questionnaires. There were fewspectators besides reporters.   The 99 questions included whether the panelists know anyoneinvolved in the case; whether they signed or circulated petitionsfor or against Mecham while he was governor; whether they belong tothe John Birch Society; whether they have bumper stickers on theircars. Also, they were asked whether they knew anyone on a long listof people associated with Mecham or his criminal case.   After the initial screening, the remaining prospective jurorsare to be called back for questioning Tuesday or later next week.   On Wednesday, a state Supreme Court justice refused a defenserequest to delay the trial until the high court considers a defensemotion to return the charges to the grand jury. The Supreme Courtis to hear arguments on that issue June 1.   Evan Mecham has refused to predict whether he will fare betterin court than at his impeachment trial. The state Senate removedthe Republican governor April 4, 15 months into his first term byconvicting him of two impeachment counts.   Prosecutors said the Mechams failed to report the $350,000 loanfrom Tempe developer Barry Wolfson on personal or campaignfinancial statements until after a newspaper reported thecontribution in October 1987.   The defense filed two new motions released Thursday, one todismiss the charges based on a claim that the campaign and personalfinance reporting laws are unconstitutionally ``vague, ambiguous,imprecise and overbroad.''   The other asks that the charges be remanded to the grand juryfor a new finding of whether probable cause exists. That motionargued that grand jury materials were improperly turned over to theprosecutors in Mecham's Senate impeachment trial.   The defense contended it was denied access to grand jurytranscripts, but the impeachment prosecutors were given documentsby the attorney general's office. However, officials have saidthose documents were not transcripts of grand jury testimony.   Ryan did not immediately schedule arguments on the motions.   Assistant Attorney General Barnett Lotstein, co-prosecutor inthe criminal trial, said some of the defense requests were``laser-beam mentality motions.'' The remark referred to Mecham'sclaim earlier this year that Attorney General Bob Corbin's officewas using laser beams to eavesdrop on conversations in thegovernor's office. Corbin denied doing so.   Mecham was convicted in the Senate of trying to thwart a deaththreat investigation and of misusing $80,000 from the governor'sprotocol fund by loaning the money to his auto dealership.   He also was impeached on charges of concealing the $350,000loan, but the Senate decided not to consider that charge for fearof prejudicing Mecham's criminal trial.</TEXT></DOC>
