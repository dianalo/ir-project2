From Portugal, where there are complaints about cuts in U.S. aid, to the Philippines, where the American presence is viewed as a vestige of colonialism, the Pentagon is fighting to retain the base structure that has supported U.S. military power since World War II. In Spain, the government is all but certain to follow through on its demand that the U.S. withdraw three squadrons of F-16 fighter aircraft.    The fraying of the basing system reflects trends that have been building for a decade and are unlikely to be reversed. Allies that once felt secure under the American military umbrella now have doubts about U.S. reliability and are being pulled by the forces of nationalism or neutralism. Friends who used to place mutual security first now care more about extracting increasing amounts of American aid in exchange for the U.S. military presence.    Losing bases will weaken Washington's ability to protect its interests around the world. &quot;It may mean that there are parts of the world we simply can't get to as rapidly with significant firepower,&quot; says Richard Perle, who was until recently an assistant secretary of defense.    Adds Rear Adm. Edward Baker of the Defense Department's international security affairs office: &quot;The distances are the thing that kill you. If ships have to commute from farther away, you need more ships and more aircraft.&quot;    The recent U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe exacerbates the problem. Many of the aircraft that would replace the missiles are housed at foreign facilities. Allies lulled by detente may decide that there is little reason for an American military presence on their soil. And if, as some analysts predict, the accord makes conventional war more likely, foreign bases would have an even more important role to play in moving men and materiel.    In the future, a shrinking American world presence could make bargaining with Moscow more difficult. &quot;If the Soviets see the conventional basing structures beginning to crumble, they'll just sit and wait it out,&quot; says Sen. John Warner, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.    Military planners concede that although vital installations in West Germany, Italy, Britain and Japan are secure, the U.S. will almost certainly be forced to shut some other key facilities. Moreover, these base closings could set off a chain reaction, ultimately compromising the U.S. capacity to project power in Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific.    Already, the Pentagon is groping to find ways to compensate for the expected losses. Navy officials say that more aircraft carriers may be necessary. Others call for more long-range cruise missiles. But few alternatives seem satisfactory. &quot;Forward deployment is the only way -- militarily -- you can defend yourself,&quot; says former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.    The Reagan administration is currently involved in disputes over bases in five nations -- Portugal, Spain, Greece, Turkey and the Philippines -- that house U.S. facilities vital to defending U.S. interests in Europe, Asia and the Mideast. Moreover, a Central America peace plan could lead to a sharply reduced U.S. presence in Honduras.    Spain, whose basing agreement with the U.S. expires next year, is demanding the removal of the 401st tactical fighter wing of F-16 nuclear-capable aircraft from Torrejon, near Madrid. The F-16s are the only U.S. land-based fighter aircraft protecting the southern flank of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and they would be used in the event of an East Bloc invasion of Europe.    Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has linked Spain's continued membership in NATO with a &quot;progressive reduction&quot; of the U.S. military presence. For now, though, the U.S. will still keep a major naval base in Rota, as well as other facilities. The current negotiations, which officially end in May, have focused on Torrejon, which some Spaniards see as a highly visible reminder of the repressive rule of Generalissimo Francisco Franco, who approved the U.S. facility.    The U.S. faces similar nationalist sentiments in the Philippines and Greece, which both threaten significant reductions in the American presence. Filipino officials have monitored the Spanish negotiations. &quot;They're all aware of the kind of deal struck establishing levels from which they begin their own negotiations,&quot; says James Blaker, the director of national security studies at the Hudson Institute.    The U.S. doesn't pay overt &quot;rent&quot; for the facilities, but basing countries have always received generous allotments of foreign assistance. These days, host countries tend to weave a mix of concerns into their demands for higher U.S. aid levels. Turkey, in its push for more funds, has complained about the U.S. flying TOW missiles over Turkey in its ill-fated arms-for-hostages deals with Iran. Portugal, for its part, claims that the Japanese beetle first appeared there on an American base, and it wants the U.S. to help pay for crop damage caused by the insect as a quid pro quo for maintaining the current military installations.    But foreign assistance has never been popular on Capitol Hill, where legislators have other priorities closer to home. Now, in the face of relentless pressure to cut U.S. spending, legislators resent efforts by foreign governments to raise the price of retaining bases. The administration requested $912 million for Turkey for last year, but Congress approved only $490 million. Overall, the administration requested $2.1 billion for the five basing countries, and Congress approved $1.4 billion.    Robert Harkavy, a Penn State University professor who has written extensively about American bases, notes that the U.S. had few foreign military bases before the Spanish-American War, when it established facilities in Cuba and the Philippines. By the beginning of World War II it had added a few other facilities, mostly coal stations for the Navy in such places as Guam and Wake Island. But these facilities proliferated during World War II, and the U.S. emerged with a network of nearly 7,000 installations, stretching from China to India to Europe. In the postwar period, the U.S. has pared the network to about 700. Many are inconspicuous listening posts or communication facilities.    The first sign that the basing system was eroding came in 1981, when Andreas Papandreou, running for prime minister of Greece, campaigned to close facilities used to support the U.S. Sixth Fleet. He changed his mind in 1983 when he signed a new five-year lease that, among other things, increased U.S. aid to $501 million in fiscal 1984 from $281 million in fiscal 1983. In the face of U.S. deficit-reduction efforts, American aid to Greece -- a NATO ally like Portugal, Spain and Turkey -- fell to $344 million last year.    New negotiations began last month, and Mr. Papandreou is again saying that the U.S. must show how its continuing military presence benefits Greece. At the same time, illustrating the bazaar-like mentality now involved in such talks, he is stressing his country's need for economic development.    The far-flung military bases are used not only to defend the regions where they are located but also to support U.S. military operations globally. For example, many of the ships and much of the equipment currently being used in the Navy's Persian Gulf operations were brought in from the Philippines. U.S. facilities in Spain are also vital to any operation requiring the swift movement of troops or equipment to the Middle East.    Earlier this year, the Pentagon commissioned the Hudson Institute to examine alternatives to the current basing system. Parts of the study are classified, but the institute's Mr. Blaker says that the U.S. doesn't have many options.    Several of the best military alternatives are fraught with political problems. For instance, Pentagon officials say that Morocco could offer an alternative to certain Spanish facilities, but Arab Morocco wouldn't allow its territory to be a jumping-off point to the Mideast and the possible defense of Israel. Similarly, Taiwan could replace some installations in the Philippines, but a beefed-up American presence on Taiwan would chill U.S. relations with China. And Guam, another alternative to the Philippines, is too far away from east Asia and the Persian Gulf region. In addition, it would cost too much to replicate the support structure in the Philippines.    America's Filipino bases are the largest overseas military facilities the U.S. maintains. Subic Bay supports operations from the Asian Pacific to the Persian Gulf and features a skilled labor pool that maintains and repairs U.S. ships. Clark Air Base is the only home outside Japan and South Korea for tactical fighter jets dedicated to Asian operations.    Navy officials argue that the trend of declining basing privileges logically translates into a greater reliance on the fleet, with more auxiliary ships to carry ammunition, supplies and fuel, as well as more aircraft carriers to project power. &quot;When the welcome mats roll up, the carrier admirals see the cash registers ringing,&quot; says Mr. Perle.    But the continuing budget crunch rules out any expansion of the fleet for the next decade. Last month a Senate financing committee actually shrank the fleet when it voted to mothball a World War II-era carrier ahead of schedule.    ---         U.S. Aid to Countries with American Bases                  (In millions of dollars)               TURKEY            1980   $402.3            1981    451.6            1982    703.0            1983    753.0            1984    856.6            1985    878.1            1986    738.0            1987    593.3            1988*   569.5               GREECE            1980   $146.2            1981    177.6            1982    281.2            1983    281.2            1984    501.4            1985    501.4            1986    431.9            1987    344.3            1988*   344.3               SPAIN            1980   $129.0            1981    129.5            1982    149.0            1983    414.1            1984    414.4            1985    414.5            1986    396.6            1987    113.0            1988*   120.0               PORTUGAL            1980   $110.9            1981     88.8            1982     87.4            1983    112.0            1984    147.9            1985    208.0            1986    188.9            1987    147.4            1988*   147.4               PHILIPPINES            1980   $152.6            1981    168.1            1982    206.8            1983    205.8            1984    211.1            1985    268.1            1986    484.7            1987    471.8            1988*   289.0**   *Subcommittee recommendation   **Supplemental funding is expected.</TEXT></DOC>
