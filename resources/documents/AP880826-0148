Botha was cheeredand serenaded Friday as he toured a black shantytown once targetedfor demolition and now being upgraded following battles that oustedanti-apartheid activists.   Botha, who has visited only a handful of black towns during his10 years in power, opened a new job-training center for thetownship near Cape Town and inspected a housing project on landformerly controlled by squatters who opposed the government.   Botha extolled the example set by appointed mayor, JohnsonNgxobongwana, the leader of the ``vigilantes'' from the oldestsection of Crossroads who burned out the militant squatters in 1986.   ``I'm encouraged by your positive attitude, which can serve asan example ... for other communities to get similar facilities,''Botha said.   He stopped at a job-training center where Ngxobongwana welcomedhim ``in the name of all Crossroads residents.'' The presidentbriefly played a xylophone and listened while a choir sang in hishonor, ``Thank you _ we accept you as our leader.''   Scores of people were killed and 70,000 squatters left homelessduring the 1986 factional fighting. The conflict left Nxgobongwanain control, and last year Crossroads was declared a township _ thefirst time since it was established in 1974 that its residents werenot classified as squatters.   Millions of blacks live in squatter camps elsewhere, and thegovernment has drafted legislation making it easier for authoritiesto evict them.   The government is building new homes for some of Ngxobongwana'ssupporters, who make up a majority of Crossroads' estimated 120,000residents. Many of his displaced opponents have moved where theauthorities wanted them, into a vast township called Khayelitsha,farther from Cape Town.   Botha, accompanied by his wife, Elize, and daughter, Rozanne,concluded his visit with a half-hour drive past Crossroads' shacks.He inspected a house under construction, and spread mortar with atrowel. Later, he shook the hand of a boy who ran alongside his car.   Botha said the employment center exemplified his government'sattempts to develop black areas.   ``To boycott is easy, but it leads nowhere,'' Botha told about200 people in the center. ``To cooperate is sometimes difficult andto take responsibility sometimes difficult. But history remembersonly those who build, not those who destroy.''   The center is used to train unemployed people in carpentry,bricklaying, sewing and other skills. Botha said 800,000 peoplehave been trained at such facilities since 1984.   ``I hope those who are only trying to belittle our country willalso come and see what can be done if they leave us alone,'' Bothasaid.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., on a five-day South African visit, madea simultaneous tour of Crossroads. He is a strong supporter ofeconomic sanctions to protest South Africa's apartheid policies ofracial segregation.   Since Crossroads began to grow in 1974, it was visited regularlyby police, bulldozers and eviction agents.   Each time the shacks were smashed, they reappeared in adifferent sandy field. Each time truckloads of women and childrenwere driven away to rural homelands, separated from their menfolkwho worked in Cape Town, thousands more families arrived. By 1986,an estimated 200,000 blacks lived in its slums.   ``Crossroads at a certain stage was seen almost as the startingpoint of the revolution,'' Information Minister Stoffel van derMerwe said Thursday. ``It is significant that the state presidentis visiting there and no abnormal security will be necessary. It issymbolic.''   Its troubled history centered around the government's formerpolicy that mixed-race people had preference over blacks for jobsin the Cape Town region, and that blacks lived there only astemporary workers.   Crossroads was born as a result of the government's attempt toremove several ``black spots'' where blacks lived illegally.   In 1984, Botha abandoned the idea that the Cape should be ajob-preference area for mixed-race people and promised a halt toforced removals for separation purposes. Raids and demolitionscontinued under slum clearance and anti-squatting laws.   A Cape Town court is hearing the first of more than 3,000 damagesuits by those who lost their homes in 1986. They contend policehelped the vigilantes.   Jan van Eck, an anti-apartheid member of Parliament, said ofCrossroads, ``The black community that rejects an Archbishop(Desmond) Tutu and accepts into its midst the oppressor, Mr. P.W.Botha, is far removed from the rest of the oppressed people ofSouth Africa.''   He was referring to graffiti near the main entrance toCrossroads that says: ``No entry for Tutu'' _ the black Anglicanleader who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheidcampaign.</TEXT></DOC>
