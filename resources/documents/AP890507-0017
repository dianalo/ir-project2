The Sunday Telegraph, in a Washington-dated story, said PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher made her views known to President Bushin diplomatic notes and telephone conversations last week.   ``Her tough stance on the issue is proving the main obstacle inthe Bush administration's frantic search for a compromise afterWest Germany's insistence that negotiations must take place as soonas possible,'' the newspaper reported.   It said Mrs. Thatcher called Bush after failing to agree on aunited NATO policy at her meeting with West German ChancellorHelmut Kohl on April 30.   At that meeting in West Germany, Mrs. Thatcher failed topersuade Kohl to abandon his quest for early talks with Moscow onreducing the missiles. The British leader argued that the 88 Lancemissiles should be modernized, not removed, and that theirreduction or removal would put Europe in greater danger of suddennuclear war involving strategic nuclear missiles.   The Sunday Telegraph said Britain and the United States want toupdate the Lance because of Soviet modernization of short-rangenuclear armory and Soviet superiority in conventional and chemicalweapons.</TEXT></DOC>
