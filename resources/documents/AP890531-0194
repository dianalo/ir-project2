DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former federal judge with a reputation as acorruption fighter and an ex-Wall Street prosecutor were amongthree watchdogs appointed Wednesday to oversee Teamsters unionoperations.   The appointments, announced at federal court in Manhattan, werepart of the settlement of a civil racketeering lawsuit against thenation's largest trade union.   ``Honest union members and the public at large are entitled to adecent and honest union _ free of criminal influences and corruptpractices,'' said U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein. ``Today'sappointments are an important first step in that direction.''   The three appointed are: Frederick B. Lacey, a former federaljudge and U.S. attorney in New Jersey; Charles M. Carberry, formerhead of the commodities and securities fraud unit of the U.S.attorney's office in Manhattan; and Michael H. Holland, formergeneral counsel to the United Mine Workers of America.   The three will oversee various union functions until late 1992.   Lacey, 68, of Glen Ridge, N.J., a 15-year veteran of the federalbench, became known for prosecuting corruption while U.S. attorneyin Newark that led to the conviction of several political figures.   As administrative officer, Lacey will have the same authority asthe union's international president and executive board to vetounion expenditures, disciplinary actions and appointments.   Holland, 42, of Chicago, will oversee the union's 1991 electionsand will have the right to supervise the union's 1996 elections. Hewas general counsel for the United Mine Workers from 1982 untillast January.   Lacey and Holland were both sworn in Wednesday by Edelstein, whoapproved the out-of-court settlement in March.   Carberry, 38, who will investigate alleged corruption in theunion with the right to file charges against Teamsters officials,members and employees, will be sworn in later, said the judge.   In 1986-87, Carberry headed the federal criminal probe offigures in Wall Street's insider trading scandals, including DennisLevine and Ivan Boesky.   Edelstein said the trio's task ``is enormous in scope andimportance'' but they ``are more than up to that task. Theirability, dedication and integrity cannot be questioned.''   ``We're very pleased with the appointees,'' said James T. Grady,the union's general counsel. ``The interest of a clean anddemocratic union are consistent with the goals of the presentleadership.''   The three posts were created as part of a settlement of thegovernment's massive civil lawsuit against the InternationalBrotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs and Warehousemen.   The lawsuit, filed last June under the civil aspects of theRacketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations act, charged that thetop leadership of the union was dominated by organized crime andhad ``made a devil's pact'' with the Mafia.   The lawsuit noted that four Teamsters presidents since the 1950shave faced federal felony charges and three were convicted: DaveBeck for embezzlement; Jimmy Hoffa for obstructing justice and mailfraud and Roy Williams for trying to bribe a U.S. senator.   The fourth, Jackie Presser, the union's president at the timethe lawsuit was brought, died while under indictment for allegedembezzlement.   Twenty-five of the 26 reputed mob figures originally named asdefendants have been convicted of Teamsters-related crimes such asextortion, embezzlement and illegal labor payoffs.   Most were dismissed from the case when they either agreed, orwere ordered, to drop any involvement with the Teamsters.   The settlement between the union and federal prosecutors,reached just hours before the case was to go to trial, also calledfor the direct election of international officers by the rank andfile.   In exchange, Teamsters leaders, whom the government sought tooust, were allowed to remain in office.</TEXT></DOC>
