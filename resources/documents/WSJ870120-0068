Simon said it won a bidding contest to take over two troubled California thrifts with a total of about $2.5 billion in assets.    In addition, members of the group said in interviews that they are actively looking at the possible acquisition of two healthy California thrifts, each with about $1.5 billion to $3 billion in assets.    If completed, the various acquisitions would make Mr. Simon and his partners significant players in the highly competitive California savings-and-loan market, which includes some of the national thrift industry's most profitable companies and some of its most spectacular failures.    The Simon group, which also includes Preston Martin, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said the group was notified by federal regulators that it was the successful bidder for Bell Savings andamp; Loan Association, San Mateo, Calif., and Southern California Savings andamp; Loan Association, Beverly Hills.    Both institutions had been taken over by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 1985 and currently are being run by managers on loan from major Southern California thrifts. Bell Savings has about $1.38 billion in assets and Southern California Savings has about $1.13 billion in assets.    The investor group still must negotiate definitive acquisition agreements with the Bank Board. The agreements will specify the exact amount and form of financial assistance to be provided by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures thrift deposits to a maximum $100,000.    Bell Savings and Southern California Savings were among five large troubled thrifts for which the Bank Board solicited takeover proposals last year. The proposals indicated how much capital the potential acquirers were willing to contribute and how the thrifts would be run. Losing bidders weren't identified, but they are believed to include several large California thrifts.    Although final terms aren't yet negotiated, the transaction could be very costly for the FSLIC. Acquirers of insolvent thrifts have generally asked the insurance fund to at least make the assets of the acquired institution match its liabilities. They have then sometimes agreed to accept further risk from loan losses and to capitalize the thrift at 3% of assets or more.    Gerald L. Parsky, a Los Angeles lawyer who is a member of the investor group, said the group will put at least $75 million of new capital into each of the two thrifts. He said the funds could be in the form of equity from the investors or debt that they issue.    Mr. Martin said: &quot;We will need assistance from the FSLIC both in terms of loans and capital, but we put our own cash up front.&quot; Mr. Martin said the group prefers to take over all of a thrift's assets, including loans or investments that have turned sour, and then take write-offs as necessary.    Last year, through a San Francisco-based company called H.F. Holdings Inc., the Simon group took over Honolulu Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, a troubled Hawaiian thrift with about $1.7 billion in assets.    Mr. Martin, chairman and chief executive officer of H.F. Holdings, said the group wrote down Honolulu Federal's assets by more than $100 million. Thrift executives generally expect that write-downs at Bell Savings and Southern California Savings will exceed that amount.    Mr. Martin said the group wants to set up separate holding companies for each of the troubled thrifts to insulate each institution from possible financial troubles of the others. Mr. Martin would be chief executive of each holding company.    As for additional acquisitions, Mr. Martin said: &quot;We're certainly not going to stop at $4 billion or $5 billion (in assets). We're going on from there.&quot;    Mr. Simon said that Ariadne Australia Ltd. of Brisbane, a conglomerate, probably will provide funding to acquire the thrifts.    As previously reported, Ariadne Australia is a partner with Mr. Simon and Mr. Parsky in International Financial Services Inc., which was established to fund investments in thrifts and real estate. The partnership was formed after Mr. Simon's group made its bid for the two troubled thrifts, but Mr. Parsky said Ariadne would be offered a participation in the ventures, subject to Bank Board approval.    Mr. Parsky wouldn't identify the two California thrifts that the group is examining. He also said the group is looking at a troubled thrift in Texas and has been asked to look at thrifts in Pennsylvania, New York and Florida. </TEXT></DOC>
