If the Reagan Revolution turns out to be a preview of a real revolution, we may look back on three books that changed our settled views of the economic, social and intellectual universe.    At the beginning of the 1980s, George Gilder's &quot;Wealth and Poverty&quot; provided a critique of conventional economics' mechanistic view of economic activity and its neglect of the importance of human incentives. Four years later we had Charles Murray's &quot;Losing Ground,&quot; a dissection of liberal social policy based on the recognition that these policies have deleterious effects on citizens' motivation and character. Having thus called attention to the central importance of character, Messrs. Gilder and Murray invited, as it were, serious and critical reflection on the state of our minds and of our souls. In &quot;The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster, 392 pages, $18.95), Allan Bloom, a political philosopher at the University of Chicago, has given us that.    And how he has given it to us: No other recent book so brilliantly knits together such astute perceptions of the contemporary scene with such depth of scholarship and philosophical learning. No other book combines such shrewd insights into our current state with so radical and fundamental a critique of it. No other book is at once so lively and so deep, so witty and so thoughtful, so outrageous and so sensible, so amusing and so chilling.    Mr. Bloom begins with an examination of the souls of our young people. The great virtue they have been taught explicitly and implicitly by our schools, our media and our culture, is openness. Openness -- &quot;and the relativism that makes it the only plausible stance in the face of various claims to truth and various ways of life and kinds of human beings&quot; -- is thought to be our great insight. Our students are therefore marked by an easygoing, non-judgmental, indiscriminateness of mind, and by a deep indifference of the soul.    Deprived of a serious education, lacking a real engagement with the great works of literature or the great people and events of history, our young people cheerfully enjoy various trivial pursuits, without any sense of the grandeur, the depths and the dramas they are missing. &quot;The longing for the beyond has been attenuated. The very models of admiration and contempt have vanished.&quot; Thus, Mr. Bloom concludes, &quot;what is advertised as a great opening is a great closing.&quot;    Having in the first part of his book allowed us to see with new clarity and depth the state of our souls, Mr. Bloom devotes the latter two-thirds to explaining how this came to be. Part Two, &quot;Nihilism, American Style,&quot; consists of an &quot;explanatory dictionary of our current language,&quot; of terms like &quot;the self&quot; and &quot;creativity&quot; and &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;values.&quot; All these terms, Mr. Bloom shows, are part of the language of &quot;value relativism&quot;; they bespeak a life of the American mind that consists of an un-self-conscious vulgarization of German philosophy, particularly of the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche's high-minded, tough-minded and tragic account of modernity's movement &quot;beyond good and evil&quot; has become, in America, &quot;easygoing nihilism,&quot; a mere mood of moodiness, a vague disquiet, &quot;nihilism without the abyss,&quot; a celebration of choice but with all choices having lost their significance, having become &quot;no-fault choices.&quot;    Mr. Bloom's &quot;explanatory dictionary&quot; of our &quot;abstract substitutes for thought&quot; uncovers the assumptions taken for granted by our vocabulary, and shows the vast gulf between the original and serious meaning of these terms and their current easy use. As he movingly says:    &quot;I have tried to provide the outline of an archaeology of our souls as they are. We are like ignorant shepherds living on a site where great civilizations once flourished. The shepherds play with the fragments that pop up to the surface, having no notion of the beautiful structures of which they were once a part. All that is necessary is a careful excavation to provide them with life-enhancing models. We need history, not to tell us what happened, or to explain the past, but to make the past alive so that it can explain us and make a future possible. This is our educational crisis and opportunity. Western rationalism has culminated in a rejection of reason.&quot;    Our universities, he concludes, are not places where serious thought, where a living transmission and criticism and renewal of the tradition thrive. &quot;The University now offers no distinctive visage to the young person . . . no vision,&quot; nor a set of competing visions, of what an educated human being is. The universities fail in their fundamental task.    I hope this summary has given a sense of this remarkable book. Only a bit less remarkable has been the reaction to it by the cultural establishment. This book -- a fierce and fundamental attack on the establishment and all it stands for, all that it has brought about -- has so far won only praise from The New York Times, The Washington Post and the newsweeklies.    Many of the reviewers who have praised Mr. Bloom's book have not faced up to to the consequences of Mr. Bloom's ideas. A college president praises Mr. Bloom's &quot;rich and absorbing&quot; book, with no indication that the institution over which he presides stands fundamentally indicted by it, and with no indication that he has any sense of the need for or urgency of fundamental reform. It is as if the intellectual establishment decided Mr. Bloom's book was too fresh, too invigorating, too impressive to ignore or condemn, so it should be patronized, and domesticated, and defanged. But the fangs remain.    It is true that Mr. Bloom is no conventional political or social conservative; it is true that he resists signing on to any particular political or social movement, and that no such movement could substitute for the kind of serious study and thought that Mr. Bloom believes necessary. But it is also true that this thought will not occur widely without the kinds of reforms that only a broad-based political and social movement can bring about. Such a movement should take as one of its guides this extraordinary book.    ---   Mr. Kristol is chief of staff/counselor to the secretary, U.S. Department of Education. </TEXT></DOC>
