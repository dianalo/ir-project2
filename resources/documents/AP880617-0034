Uno is scheduled to leave next Wednesday for a tour of theMiddle East that will take him to Israel, Syria, Jordan and Egypt.His visit will be the first ever by a Cabinet official since Japanopened diplomatic ties with Israel in 1952, according to theForeign Ministry.   Books blaming everything from the Chernobyl nuclear accident tothe rapid appreciation of the yen on the ``Jewish conspiracy''brought Cooper and Alfred Balitzer, professor of political scienceat California's Claremont McKenna College, to Japan last week.   Cooper pointed to scores of books laid out on a table in hisTokyo hotel room. The cover of one showed a blue Star of Davidtransposed over a sign post saying Wall Street.   Over 80,000 copies of ``Understand the Jews and the Epoch Comesinto View'' by Masami Uno, the most popular writer in the genre,have been printed since the book was released less than one monthago, said a spokesman for the Nihon Bungei publishing house.   In all, sales of Uno's three main books go into the hundreds ofthousands of copies.   Foreign Minister Uno is not related to the author.   Titles of books by other writers include, ``How to Make Moneywith Stocks the Jews Aim At'' and ``The Jewish Plan for Conquest ofthe World.''   ``There is 100 times as much printed in the United States, butnone sell like this. Here they sell like hotcakes and no one speaksout against them,'' Balitzer said.   ``The people of Israel are not Japan watchers, but they read thenewspapers and they see articles about these books.''   Cooper said, ``This may be a bum rap for Uno when he goes toIsrael, but if Japanese leaders decide to avoid answering thisissue, their silence will be taken by Arabs as a deep reservoir ofanti-Jewish feelings.''   He said the Japanese government has remained quiet on the issueto avoid conflict with Arab nations, which supply Japan with 70percent of its oil.   In 1987, then Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari denouncedanti-Semitic writings in the Diet, Japan's parliament, but it waslargely ignored by the Japanese media.   An Israeli official in Tokyo said he doubted whether the issuewill be raised during Uno's visit, but he said the Israeligovernment has expressed informal concern.   ``The matter doesn't directly affect us,'' he said, speaking oncondition of anonymity. ``The real target of the books is AmericanJews. In Israel it is just seen as strange that Japanese wouldwrite such things.''   Cooper and Balitzer believe the books represent more thananything else ignorance and curiousity about the Jews, who number400 households in Japan. Only six of those families reside herepermanently.   ``It's anti-Semitism without anti-Semites. We see no problem ofviolence directed against the Jewish community here,'' Cooperexplained. ``Most Japanese don't really know what a Jew is.''   Balitzer said: ``When the authors say the Jews control theworld, they see to be admiring this. Their attitude is, `How can wedo that?'''   A Foreign Ministry official, also speaking privately, said hedid not know whether the issue would be discussed. ``Publication ofsuch books is legal and can't be stopped, but it is unwanted byus.''   When asked why it has taken 36 years for Japan to send a Cabinetminister to Israel, the official said: ``There are many nations yetto be officially visited. There is no special reason.''   The Israeli official said Israeli-Japanese trade volume was up84 percent in the first three months of this year. Israel maintainsa trade surplus with Japan, and the Israeli government estimatestrade between the two countries this year will total $1.2 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
