At another rally Wednesday, coal miners and supporters plantedsmall white wooden crosses in the lawn of Pittston's parent companyin Greenwich, Conn.   In southern West Virginia, where pickets have blocked Pittstontrucks, Circuit Judge Eric O'Briant on Wednesday slapped the miners'union with more than a dozen contempt citations and set an Aug. 1hearing to determine whether the union should compensate Pittstonfor losses.   In St. Paul, Va., 300 steelworkers joined nearly 2,700 UnitedMine Workers members and supporters from a half dozen states.   ``Every union man in this country has a stake in this,'' saidMike Hathaway, a wildcat striker from Steelville, Ill. ``If theybreak this union, they'll break every union right on down the line.''   ``We're just trying to show these miners that unions around thecountry are behind them 100 percent,'' said Joe Kiker, a steelworkerfrom Atlanta and a former coal miner. ``It's our fight, too.''   About 1,600 Pittston miners went on strike April 5 in WestVirginia and Virginia after working 14 months without a contract.The company is seeking cutbacks that it says are needed to competewith foreign coal producers.   The strikers were joined earlier this month by 300 Pittstonminers in Kentucky.   The walkout triggered sympathy strikes beginning June 12 and atone point included 46,000 miners in West Virginia, Alabama,Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginiaand Missouri. The wildcat miners in Missouri and Virginia have goneback to work.   Coal industry and union officials estimate 37,000 miners remainout.   Before Wednesday night's rally in Virginia, the governors ofthree more states joined four others in calling for an end to thePittston strike.   Govs. Richard Thompson of Illinois, Robert Casey of Pennsylvaniaand John Ashcroft of Missouri asked the UMW and Pittston to resumenegotiations.   ``No one knows better than you the terrible economic andemotional strain of a protracted strike,'' Ashcroft wrote to PaulDouglas, chairman of The Pittston Co., the coal company's parent.   There was no immediate response from the union or Pittston.   The call echoed requests of Govs. Gaston Caperton of WestVirginia, Richard Celeste of Ohio, Gerald Baliles of Virginia andWallace Wilkinson of Kentucky.   A federal judge in Charleston, W.Va., this week ordered an end tothe wildcat strike, but strikers have largely ignored previousback-to-work orders.   The UMW says it has not authorized the wildcat strikes, whichviolate the contract the union signed in February 1988 with theBituminous Coal Operators Association, which represents most majorcoal operators but not Pittston.   On Wednesday, four coal trucks in West Virginia and Virginia werepeppered with bullets and two others were damaged by steel ballsfired from slingshots. No injuries were reported and no arrests weremade.   Shots were fired at coal trucks and on picket lines late lastweek for the first time since the wildcat strikes began. No one wasseriously injured.   In Virginia, union members continued to create traffic jams oncoal hauling roads despite a federal judge's threat of daily finesof $120,000.   Hundreds of cars and trucks paraded slowly on a narrow roadlinking Pittston Coal Group's main processing plant with supplymines, said State Police spokesman Charlie Vaughan.   At the rally in Connecticut, 350 coal miners and their familiesheld an emotional but peaceful rally outside Pittston headquarters.They carried small crosses bearing the names of miners killed inaccidents or dead from black lung disease.   The demonstrators were bused to Connecticut from Pennsylvania andVirginia by the union.</TEXT></DOC>
