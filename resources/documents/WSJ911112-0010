There has been a growing chorus that the department hasbeen too slow to act against Bank of Credit andamp; CommerceInternational. The Federal Reserve alleges BCCI covertlygained control of a number of U.S. financial institutions,including Washington D.C.'s largest bank holding company,First American Bankshares Inc. BCCI is a unit of BCCIHoldings (Luxembourg) S.A.</LP><TEXT>   The Justice Department maintains that it is aggressivelytrying to pursue its investigation. &quot;There've basically beenthree rules,&quot; a spokesman for Mr. Barr explains:&quot;aggressively pursue; spare no expense and follow evidencewherever it leads.&quot;   A report on NBC News last night alleged that former BCCIofficer Nazir Chinoy had offered information to the JusticeDepartment relating to the bank's arms-trading activitiesinvolving the Central Intelligence Agency. The report alsocited alleged delays in bringing a BCCI-related tax case tosupport the contention that the Justice Department was movingslowly against the scandal-plagued bank. A spokesman for theJustice Department roundly rejected any notion offoot-dragging and said: &quot;We expect to begin our prosecutionof Mr. Chinoy later this year or early next.&quot;   Last night, neither Mr. Chinoy nor his attorney could bereached for comment.   The department likes to draw attention to the January 1990plea agreement it made with BCCI in federal court in Tampa,Fla., that resulted in a $15 million fine and a guilty pleato money-laundering charges. But, critics say, the longinvestigation that led to that trial was started on theinitiative of local Customs Service agents and carried out bythem. In addition, the skeptics charge, the plea agreementallowed the bank to ensure that the considerable evidencecollected by the investigation wasn't used against the bankin any future federal charges in Tampa.   Before coming to the Justice Department as assistantattorney general in 1989, Mr. Barr, a Beltway insider withconservative credentials, was a partner in the Washingtonfirm of Shaw Pittman Potts andamp; Trowbridge, which has longplayed a part in the tangled BCCI saga. R. Kenly Webster, aShaw Pittman partner, is currently representing Swaleh Naqvi,BCCI's former chief executive, who has been indicted onfraud, false accounting, money-laundering and other chargesby a state grand jury convened by the Manhattan DistrictAttorney, Robert Morgenthau. More recently, Mr. Naqvi hasbeen indicted in Tampa on similar federal charges.   Shaw Pittman also represented B. Francis Saul II, adirector and powerful shareholder in Financial GeneralBankshares Inc., which later became First AmericanBankshares. It was Mr. Saul who in February 1978 indicated inan affidavit that he had been told BCCI wanted to controlFinancial General. But it was only this year that the Feddetermined that BCCI did indeed control as much as 60% ofFirst American's stock, and that it had played a key role inorchestrating the covert acquisition of Washington's biggestbank holding company. The Fed made criminal referrals to theJustice Department in late January this year.   A Justice Department spokesman says that Mr. Barr wasn'tinvolved in representing Mr. Saul. Most of his work at thefirm involved civil litigation and administrative law. Mr.Barr, 41 years old, spent two stints with the firm, fromOctober 1978 to May 1982 and from September 1983 to early1989, becoming a partner in April 1985.   Mr. Barr began his career in 1973 working at the CentralIntelligence Agency when it was headed by George Bush. WhenMr. Bush testified before Congress as CIA director, Mr. Barr,a staffer in the CIA general counsel's office, would be oneof the team that went along to support him.   While at the CIA, Mr. Barr, who has bachelor's andmaster's degrees in Chinese studies from Columbia University,studied law in night school at George Washington Universitybefore joining Shaw Pittman as an associate in 1978.   Mr. Barr went to the Justice department as assistantattorney general heading the office of legal counsel in 1989after working on George Bush's transition team. He becamedeputy attorney general in 1990. He has generally beencredited with a reputation for quiet but effectivemanagement.   He has also gained a reputation for aggressiveconservatism, sparking a row with Congress in 1989 when heauthored a legal opinion saying that the U.S., if it facesserious threats to its own security, is justified inabducting fugitives overseas, even if it breaks internationaltreaties. The administration used that opinion to justify the1989 invasion of Panama and the arrest of Manuel Noriega. Mr.Barr's handling of a prison hostage crisis in Talladega,Ala., in August 1991 is often cited by his supporters asevidence of his cool leadership.</TEXT></DOC>
