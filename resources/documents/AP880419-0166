Nor would he comment on Iran's claims that its forces hadbrought the craft down.   Carlucci, asked as he left a memorial service for policeofficers and others killed enforcing drug laws whether the copterwas considered lost, answered:   ``I'm not going to speculate. We're continuing to look, and I'mcertainly hopeful.''   Asked about Iranian claims that its forces had shot thehelicopter down, Carlucci replied, ``I'm not going to get into thedetails.''   The Marine Corps, meanwhile, changed the status of thehelicopter's two crewmen to missing.   Pentagon Spokesman Dan Howard identified them as Capt. StephenC. Leslie, 30, and Capt. Kenneth W. Hill, 33, assigned to SquadronHMLA-167 based at the New River, N.C., Marine Corps Air Station.   Leslie claims a home of record of New Bern and Hill a home ofrecord of Thomasville, N.C., the Pentagon said.   Howard repeated statements of Monday that the Cobra had beensent out on a ``standard patrol sweep'' and that there was noevidence to suggest the copter had ever come under fire.   As he commented, U.S. Navy ships and planes continued to searchfor the Marine Cobra attack helicopter over the central gulf.   The helicopter did not return to the USS Wainwright Monday afterwhat Pentagon officials called a ``routine reconnaissance mission.''   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Mondaynight that Iranian warships, ``in a heroic clash with the aggressorAmerican helicopters in the Persian Gulf shot down one of themMonday afternoon.''   Addressing the search, a Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Charles Boyd,said today:   ``There is a very extensive search underway. Numerous ships andhelicopters are involved. The airborne search stopped during thenight and resumed at daylight, but numerous surface ships keptsearching during the night.''   The helicopter was in the lower central portion of the gulf,near the area of Monday's heaviest fighting, when it disappeared,according to the Pentagon, which was not releasing the names of thetwo crewmen.   Another Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col., Arnold Williams, said thehelicopter was assigned to the USS Trenton as part of the Marinetask force protecting Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. Thehelicopter was operating temporarily from the Wainwright, acruiser, he said.   Williams said he did not know what radio contact there had beenwith the helicopter.   No American casualties were reported in the initial attacks onIranian positions and the later return fire from Iranian speedboats and land-based missiles.</TEXT></DOC>
