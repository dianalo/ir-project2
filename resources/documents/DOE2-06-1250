The continuous loss of fertile soil, windand water erosion, vegetation degradation, droughts and forest firesall contribute to the creation of a potentially alarming situation. Ifone adds to this list the threat posed by acid rain, and the possibilityof a climatic change inducing drier and warmer conditions in areas alreadyheavily affected by degradation of soil and vegetation, the problem ofdesertification in Europe could be seen as being grave. This book focuseson those processes in which nature and Man cooperate in producing acceleratedand irreversible barreness of once fertile soils. One paper discussesthe use of short-lived radioisotopes to provide chronologies of sedimentation.</TEXT></DOC>
