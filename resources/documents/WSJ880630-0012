Jones, and two top officers received subpoenas from a federal grand jury here seeking information about the company's financial dealings in South Korea.    As previously reported, the Justice Department on June 15 began a criminal investigation into $7.8 million in questionable payments made by Northrop between 1984 and 1986 to companies controlled by an individual with ties to high officials of the Korean government. Los Angeles-based Northrop made the payments in an attempt to sell its F-20 aircraft.    Northrop has filed suit in Korea to recover part of its payments from the family of its now-deceased associate, Park Chongkyu, asserting that Mr. Park and others conspired to defraud Northrop of its money. The South Korean government never bought the F-20.    Northrop has maintained that $6.3 million of its money, deposited in Hong Kong, was earmarked for a Seoul hotel-development company and $1.3 million was compensation for its Korean lobbying firm. Both concerns were controlled by Mr. Park, who was an official of the Seoul Olympics committee and a former Korean legislator and presidential aide. Mr. Park's family and associates have claimed that the hotel venture was a cover for a lobbying fund. Northrop's secret arrangement with Mr. Park to market the F-20 was the subject of a recent front-page story in this newspaper.    A spokesman for Northrop declined to elaborate on a brief prepared statement. Neither Mr. Jones, who is also Northrop's chief executive, nor the others who received subpoenas could be reached. The other officials are Welko E. Gasich, an executive vice president who was in charge of marketing the F-20 in Korea, and William G. McGagh, a former chief financial officer who is now a consultant to the company.    Mr. McGagh and two lower-level Northrop managers retired this spring after the executive committee of Northrop's board received the results of a two-year investigation of the Korean dealings.    The government's investigation is focusing on whether Northrop's foreign payments violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a federal law that prohibits payments by American companies, directly or indirectly, to foreign government officials. If Northrop were found in violation of the law, the company and its chairman might also be found in contempt of a consent decree signed by both with the Securities and Exchange Commission, individuals familiar with the Justice Department investigation have said.    Mr. Jones and the company signed the 1975 consent decree, agreeing to refrain from securities-law violations, in connection with about $30 million in questionable foreign payments made to governments and consultants around the world.    Northrop's Korean matter is also the subject of an investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which plans to hold hearings next month. The Korean prosecutor's office and a committee of the national assembly have also been looking into the matter as part of a larger probe into corruption in the administration of former President Chun Do Hwan. Mr. Chun and Northrop's Mr. Jones have both acknowledged meeting, although they haven't disclosed the topic of their discussions.    Separately, the Justice Department's criminal division has been investigating Northrop for possible mischarging and test falsification on contracts covering equipment for the MX missile and the air-launched cruise missile, and the secret Stealth bomber. Northrop has also been the target of employee-initiated civil suits over these contracts.    Northrop's plant in Newbury Park, Calif., was searched by the Federal Bureau of Investigation earlier this month in connection with the broad investigation of bribery and information-selling at the Pentagon. The plant makes unmanned target aircraft and a Navy missile known as Tacit Rainbow. </TEXT></DOC>
