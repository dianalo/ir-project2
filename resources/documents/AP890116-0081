Find it impossible to sing ``The Star-SpangledBanner''? Tired of those truckers who use a radar detector to roarunmolested through speed traps?   Who you gonna call? Try your member of Congress. If the first twodays of the 1989 session are any indication, he or she willintroduce a bill on just about any subject.   During those two days, House members introduced at least 504bills and 139 resolutions. Senators won't start introducinglegislation until the Senate reconvenes Jan. 20.   The most popular subject was taxes _ scores of tax bills of onevariety or another were offered; almost without exception they wouldcut taxes. The only increases proposed would hit imported oil(offered by Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla.), snuff and chewing tobacco(Rep. Brian Donnelly, D-Mass.), and deductions for corporatetakeovers (Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.)   Social Security bills were offered by the dozens, and most wouldrestore benefits that Congress took away during the Reagan era.Several would permit recipients to earn unlimited wages withoutlosing part of their benefits.   There are proposed constitutional amendments galore. They wouldoutlaw abortion, allow organized school prayer, spell out equalrights for women, prohibit busing, repeal the two-term limitation onpresidents, limit a president or senator to one six-year term and aHouse member to three two-year terms and prohibit a president frompardoning a person who had not been convicted.   What's more, just about every House member seems to have proposedor signed a bill to block the pay raise recommended by PresidentReagan for members of Congress and other top government officials.   If history is a guide, chances are that fewer than a dozen of the504 bills will become law. It's a pretty good bet that the billsblocking the pay raise will not be among them.   The bills address virtually every problem that a member ofCongress might have heard mentioned during the recent campaign.Thus, they provide a handy guide to what lawmakers are thinkingabout.
