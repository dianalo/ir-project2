Of four jurors who commented publicly, three said North shouldgo to prison for the crimes. One said, ``That's not for me to say.''   Jury foreman Denise Anderson said she believed North got a fairtrial, but she also said former President Reagan ``should have beendown there'' to testify ``because he knew a lot about what wasgoing on.''   Asked if Bush should have been compelled to testify, she added,``Yes, I'm not leaving him out.''   North's lawyers unsuccessfully sought subpoenas for both Reaganand for Bush, who was vice president at the time of the eventscovered in the trial.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell will sentence North on June23, with maximum possible penalties of 10 years in prison and$750,000 in fines.   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, responding to questions on thesubject of a pardon, said he had asked the president about it onThursday.   ``He said `I haven't discussed it with anybody,''' the WhiteHouse press secretary said.   Pressed by reporters, Fitzwater said, ``We don't want tospeculate either way. ... There's been no discussion of a pardonwhatsoever.''   Bush had in the past said that North, a decorated Vietnamveteran, was a hero and had said he hoped the former White Houseaide would be acquitted. But the president has repeatedly said hehas not discussed the possibility of a pardon, and he showedirritation recently at a published report speculating on what hemight do.   Fitzwater also said Bush preferred ``not to have any comment atthis time'' on the verdicts.   Documents in the trial suggested a bigger role for Bush thanearlier revealed concerning the solicitation of other countries'support for the Contras. But Bush, who visited Honduras' presidentin early 1985, declared Thursday the meeting had not been part ofany deal to provide Honduras with expedited U.S. aid in return forhelp for the rebels.   North, out of the public eye on Friday, said Thursday he wouldappeal and was confident of eventual vindication.   Meanwhile, most of the jurors rested in private after thethree-month trial and 12 days of deliberations. But four commented:   _Ms. Anderson, the 34-year-old foreman, said she saw theIran-Contra issue as a political dispute, ``a war between theDemocrats and the Republicans.'' And when asked if North had``taken the heat'' for higher-ups, she said, ``That's myimpression.'' But when asked if North should go to prison, shesaid, ``I think he should do some time.''   She said she was glad for North's sake that in court ``he got upthere and said something for himself.'' But she said he ``didn'treally impress me that much.'' And she said she found the testimonyof North's former secretary, Fawn Hall, ``phony. ... I just did notappreciate her crying _ the way it seemed she had everything setup.''   _Earl F. Williams, 65, who served with General George Patton's3rd Army during World War II, expressed sympathy for North, aformer Marine who served on the National Security Council staff inthe Reagan White House. ``I think in my heart that he thought hewas doing the right thing,'' Williams said. ``And I think therewere people higher who gave him authority to do a lot of things andthen when he got caught out there high and dry, no one came to helphim.''   At first he said it was ``not for me to say'' if North should goto prison. But when pressed, he said, ``I feel that if he's guiltyhe should go to jail, which he is, so. ...''   _Tara King, 35, said she helped persuade fellow jurors whowanted to acquit North on all counts that they could not find himinnocent of actions he had admitted. ``You got it from word ofmouth that he knew it was against the law,'' she said. And she saidhe should serve time in prison.   Yet, when asked if she considered North a hero, Miss King said,``Yes, in some sense. He fought in the war. He tried to savehostages. He put himself out there.''   Later Friday, she said that she had been using cocaine until``three or four months'' before the trial but that it did notaffect her work as a juror. ``That was months ago, months before Igot on this trial,'' she said in a telephone interview after firstdiscussing her past drug use on WJLA television in Washington.   _Ernest Nelson, 29, an electronics technician, said he doubtedthat all the facts in the Iran-Contra affair would ever come outand because ``a lot of lives were involved ... in some cases it'sprobably best that it is kept that way.''   Asked if North should go to prison, he said, ``That's not for meto say.''   Ms. Anderson, Miss King and Williams spoke at their homes. Ms.Anderson also was interviewed by CNN as was Nelson.   The jury found North guilty of accepting a $13,800 home securitysystem from retired Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a co-defendant whomNorth had hired to run arms to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   In addition, the jurors convicted North of destroying, alteringor removing documents from the NSC. North said former NationalSecurity Adviser Robert McFarlane told him to alter memos, butMcFarlane testified that North suggested the alteration.   The jurors also found North guilty of aiding and abettingobstruction of Congress in November 1986 through the preparation ofa false chronology regarding the arms shipments to Iran thatengulfed the White House in controversy during former PresidentReagan's second term.</TEXT></DOC>
