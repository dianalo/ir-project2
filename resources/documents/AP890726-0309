Robert Tappan Morris, 24, who has been suspended from theuniversity for one year, was indicted by a federal grand jury inSyracuse, N.Y., on a single count of accessing withoutauthorization at least four university and military computers.   The computer-crime indictment charged that the virus, whichspread across a nationwide network of computers, prevented theauthorized use of those computers by universities and militarybases.   The Justice Department said in a statement released here thatMorris was the first person to be charged under a provision of theComputer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 that outlaws unauthorizedaccesss to computers by hackers. The provision also makes itillegal to gain entry to a computer to damage or destroy files.   The indictment comes after months of deliberations within theJustice Department over whether to charge Morris with a felony or amisdemeanor.   Morris, of Arnold, Md., could face a possible five-year sentenceand a $250,000 fine if convicted of the charge.   The law also provides for restitution of victims of a computercrime, but prosecutors did not specify how much damage was causedby the Nov. 2, 1988, incident that virtually shut down amilitary-university computer network used to transmitnon-classified data.   An industry group estimated that as much as $96 million worth ofdamage was caused by the virus to 6,200 computers.   But a Cornell University commission, which criticized Morris'actions as ``reckless and impetuous,'' called this estimate``grossly exaggerated'' and ``self-serving.''   Defense attorney Thomas A. Guidoboni, said Morris ``accepts thisevent as a step toward the final resolution of this matter.''   ``An indictment is simply a formal accusation,'' Guidoboni said.``Mr. Morris will enter a plea of not guity and contest the chargeagainst him.'' Morris ``looks forward to his eventual vindicationand his return to a normal life,'' the defense lawyer said.   As many as 6,000 university and military computers on thenationwide ARPANET network were infected by the virus or computer``worm'' that the Cornell University commission concluded wascreated by Morris.   The panel called the incident ``a juvenile act that ignored theclear potential consequences'' and showed a ``reckless disregard ofthose probable consequences.''   But the commission noted that ``it appears to have been anuncharacteristic act for Morris,'' who had graduated from HarvardUniversity last year before beginning a graduate program incomputer science at Cornell.   Guidoboni said Morris, who has been on leave from the universitysince the incident, was placed on a one-year's suspension thatbegins in September.   The defendant's father is chief computer scientist for theNational Computer Security Center near Baltimore.   The indictment charged that the younger Morris ``intentionallyand without authorization'' accessed computers located at theUniversity of California at Berkeley; the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration in Moffett Field, Calif.; Purdue University inWest Lafayette, Ind.; the U.S. Air Force Logistics Command atWright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and others notspecified.   The spread of the virus ``prevented the authorized use of one ormore of these federal interest computers and thereby caused a lossto one or more others'' of more than $1,000, the indictment charged.   Although the virus disrupted the operations of thousands ofcomputers, Cornell University spokesman Dennis Meredith said it didnot erase any files of electronically stored data.   But he said ``there is absolutely no doubt that the computerworm did serious damage to computer systems around the country.''</TEXT></DOC>
