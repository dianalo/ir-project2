An objective of the ABT regulations is toprovide an opportunity to fish for ABT to as many participants in the fisheryas possible. To foster this objective, the catch limit was set at one ABTper day per vessel for the General category. A multiple catch limit wouldhave resulted in an early attainment of the quota and closure of the fisherydue to the relatively greater availability of ABT and the ability of asmall number of experienced and successful participants in the fisheryto catch large numbers of these fish. The September 1 date was chosen becausemost of the occasional participants in the fishery would have finishedtheir fishing for the season by that date. After September 1, there wasno compelling reason to keep the daily catch limit at one ABT per day ifa sufficient portion of the quota remained.The circumstances of the fishery have changed dramatically since the dailycatch limit was first implemented. In 1988, only a little over one-halfof the quota for the General category was harvested. NOAA has concludedthat the daily catch limit was a factor in not harvesting the quota. Sincethe purpose of the catch limit is to allow for the maximum use of the quotawhile ensuring that the season remains open from June to October, a moreflexible approach to adjusting the daily catch limit seems appropriate.This rule would remove the reference to the September 1 date in the regulation,and allow the Assistant Administrator to adjust the daily catch limit upwardor downward at any time during the season as circumstances warrant.In 1988, NMFS received a petition from a number of harpoon fishermen toban the use of spotter aircraft in all but the Purse Seine category. (Banningthe use of spotter aircraft in the Purse Seine category would essentiallyprevent the harvest of the quota for that category.) A meeting was heldwith representatives of the harpoon fishermen to explore the issue. Theycomplained that the proliferation of spotter aircraft, particularly inthe Harpoon Boat category, was changing the traditional nature of the fishery.On March 31, 1988, NMFS published a notice (53 FR 10415) soliciting commentson the petition. Many comments were received, the majority of which supportedthe ban. A meeting was also held with a number of spotter pilots who presentedinformation in rebuttal to the information provided by the harpoon fishermen.The Harpoon Boat category was established in 1980 based upon informationsupplied by a small number of harpoon fishermen. They presented evidencethat supported the conclusion that there was a small traditional fisherythat should be segregated from the General category. The harpoon fisherycould only be pursued under optimal weather and sea conditions since onehad to be able to see the fish to make an accurate strike with a harpoon.The fact that there are a limited number of days during the season thatpermit the fish to be harvested by this technique supports a multiple dailycatch allowance. Applying the General category daily catch limit couldseverely hamper the ability of traditional harpooners to take even thesmall quota that was set aside for the Harpoon Boat category.After a review of all the information presented on this issue, NMFS believesthat it is in the best interests of the fishery to prohibit the use ofspotter aircraft to aid in the harvest of ABT, except in the Purse Seinecategory. NMFS believes that the growing use of these aircraft changesthe traditional nature of both the Harpoon Boat and General categoriessince optimal weather and sea conditions are less important for harpoonersfishing with the aid of aircraft. The use of these aircraft, together withthe large increase of vessels permitted in the Harpoon Boat category, hasgreatly accelerated the rate at which their quota is caught. NOAA believesthat a number of boats are attracted to this category because of the lackof a daily catch limit and the possibility of enhancing their catch throughthe use of an airplane.NMFS is also concerned that the use of aircraft will concentrate the catchamong fewer vessels. Information provided to NMFS indicates that roughly80 percent of the 1988 catch in the Harpoon Boat category was harvestedby the 4% of the vessels in the category assisted by aircraft.In addition to fewer individuals catching most of the fish, an increasedcatch rate may cause a premature closure of the fishery, precluding manyothers a reasonable opportunity to fish. There is also concern that theincreased pressure represented by the use of these aircraft will causethe fish to sound, thereby decreasing opportunity for their capture bytraditional methods.The use of spotter aircraft also poses safety concerns. NMFS has an obligationto manage this fishery through regulations that do not jeopardize the safetyof participants. This concern is currently reflected in the requirementthat only a vessel that is capable of traveling to and from the fishinggrounds under its own power is eligible for a permit. To allow otherwise,given the value of these fish and the distance of the fishing grounds fromshore, could induce someone to take an unreasonable risk. The use of aspotter aircraft allegedly attracts other vessels. This could prove dangerousif several vessels converge in the area. The experience that gave riseto the requirement that vessels had to stay 100 yards (91.4 m) or morefrom the corkline of a purse seine net fishing for ABT provides ample evidenceof the risk to vessel and personal safety represented by several boatsattempting to harvest the same fish.Consequently, NMFS believes that a ban on the use of spotter airplanesis necessary to ameliorate the problems cited above.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Northeast Regional Office is preparing an environmental assessmentfor this rule. You may obtain a copy of the environmental assessment fromthe address listed above. The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere,NOAA (Under Secretary) has determined that this proposed rule is not a``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order12291. The proposed action will not have a cumulative effect on the economyof $100 million or more, nor will it result in a major increase in coststo consumers, industries, government agencies, or geographical regions.No significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or competitiveness of U.S. based enterprisesare anticipated.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the SmallBusiness Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.The proposal to ban the use of aircraft to assist ABT fishing operationswill not affect a substantial number of entities because only about tenof the estimated 10,000 vessels in the fleet use aircraft at the presenttime. Therefore, approximately ten pilots will be affected as well. Thesepilots generally derive the bulk of their employment from the swordfish,menhaden, and bluefin tuna purse seine fisheries. Because the use of aircraftin the bluefin tuna handgear fisheries is a new development, the degreeof investment has not been such that a substantial economic impact wouldresult. However, it does appear that the introduction of spotter aircraftmay have a significant impact on the traditional fishermen who are beingdisplaced. Furthermore, the purpose of the proposed change in the dailycatch limit time frame is to relieve a regulatory restriction on the participantsin the General category to allow full use of the quota. Removing the referencedate for a decision to adjust the daily catch limit will allow the AssisantAdministrator to set the daily catch limit to reflect the availabilityof the fish during a fishing season. As a result, a regulatory flexibilityanalysis was not prepared.The Under Secretary determined that this proposed rule does not containa collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork ReductionAct. This proposed rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 285 </ITAG>Fisheries, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Treaties.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
