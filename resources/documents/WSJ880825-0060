The plywood and insulation concern said the proposal contemplates a deferred payment system intended to allow the company to continue operating while pursuing claims against its own insurers.    Fibreboard said it previously won court decisions against insurers that would set &quot;no aggregate limit&quot; on coverage for claims for asbestos exposure that started before 1959. Such claimants involve the &quot;vast majority&quot; of those affected, the company believes.    The proposal involves offers to negotiate individual settlements with plaintiffs but sets no specific dollar amounts and would still be dependent upon recoveries from insurers. But the company said injured persons would benefit from having an actually &quot;liquidated&quot; claim.    Fibreboard, along with several other defendants in asbestos-related suits, recently decided to withdraw from the Asbestos Claims Facility, a consortium of former manufacturers and insurers set up to speed claims resolution. The facility had drawn criticism from participants for delays and other problems. </TEXT></DOC>
