 Needs Integrated IRM Framework To Keep Up With Information RevolutionandM;In the last 20 years, we have witnessed what amounts to a revolution incomputer technology.andP;  Even though we have not yet reached the paperlesssociety that was predicted by many, we have, in fact, experienced anexplosion of information.andM;Responding to this mushrooming of information, industry and government havedeveloped new information management organizations to keep pace with thegrowth of information in both paper and electronic formats.andM;Concern and frustration over unnecessary paperwork and uncontrolledgovernment collection of information triggered Congress to pass the PaperworkReduction Act, a comprehensive information management law aimed at lesseningthe amount of red tape we are subjected to.andP;  In enacting the law in 1980,Congress paid especially close attention to the findings of a specialcommission that said the total cost of federal paperwork may exceed $100billion a year.andM;The General Accounting Office, when recently asked by Congress to measure thereduction of the paperwork burden, found that despite the law's intentions,there has been little evidence of actual reduction in paperwork.andP;  At hearingsthat I, as the chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee onGovernment Information and Regulation, held earlier this year, I heardsmall-business leaders confirm this dismal finding.andM;One group has said that if the Commission on Federal Paperwork were toconduct its study today, it would find the annual cost of federal paperworkto American businesses is more than $330 billion -- three times greater thanit was just a decade ago.andM;Dealing With the ExplosionandM;The need to reduce the paperwork burden is part of a broader effort to dealwith the information explosion in our society and to strengthen themanagement of information resources throughout the government.andP;  The lifecycle of government information -- from data collection to dissemination --has many components, and managing this process requires a careful balancingof benefit and burden.andM;All too often the goal of reducing unnecessary federal paperwork iscomplicated by the fact that information collection policy must serve anumber of different purposes.andP;  Indeed, many important laws -- from theprevention of defense procurement fraud to the improvement of worker safety-- require detailed information and ongoing record keeping.andM;For example, maintenance records that offer important information abouttrucks and loaders that have been found to be dangerous can protect the livesof thousands of mine workers.andP;  Fair housing laws can be enforced based oninformation about race, sex and ethnic backgounrd provided by applicantsseeking home mortgage insurance.andM;Perhaps even the recent scandals involving the nations savings and loaninstitutions and several Housing and Urban Development Department programscould have been prevented if better information had been collected, analyzedand used to make appropriate decisions.andM;The Importance of InformationandM;In today's rapidly changing world we must be just as concerned with thegovernment's methods of collecting information as we are with what itcollects.andP;  One only needs to recall the clamor over the release of theInternal Revenue Service's extremely complex W-4 employee withholding form inconnection with the &quot;Tax Simplification Act&quot; to realize how importantinformation-gathering is to society at large.andM;More recently, the Congress was deluged with mail and phone calls from voterswanting us to take fast action about Section 89 rules on employee healthplans.andM;In addition to the time and expense involved in completing complex forms,there is an added emotional cost -- in terms of anxiety, anger andfrustration -- that cannot be underestimated.andP;  Undoubtedly almost everyone --not just persons trying to secure a technical procurement contract from thePentagon -- can relate to the frustration that stems from being tied up inred tape.andM;Congress now is facing these and other related issues in an effort toreauthorize the Paperwork Reduction Act.andP;  Hearings in the Senate and theHouse have been replete with pleas from individuals who want the law improvedand better enforced.andP;  The debate has been wide-ranging.andM;The Office of Management and Budget has been criticized for doing too littleto reduce the paperwork burden and too much in its review of proposedregulations.andP;  Others think the federal agencies are the culprits, while stillothers view the Congress as being idle.andM;Unified Approach NeededandM;It is my hope that reauthorization of the Paperwork Reduction Act will createa renewed and unified approach by the Congress, the executive branch andfederal agencies to improve the management of information resources andultimately it will lead to a sound national information policy.andM;To keep peace with the information revolution in government, we mustestablish an integrated information resources management framework.andP;  Thisframework will balance the benefits of accurate and publicly accessibleinformation with the costs and burdens associated with collecting andmanaging government information.andM;Such a framework should lead to a more reliable and accurate statisticaldatabase, thus enabling us to make better policy decisions to serve thenation today and in future decades.andM;Secondly, we must have a well-coordinated information policy program thatcovers all formats -- electronic and paper -- and that directs us away fromthe traditional &quot;stop-and-start&quot; style of government decision-making.andM;And lastly, despite the attractions and excitement of new and evolvingtechnologies, our nation's information policy must be tempered by awarenessof the limited financial resources available for keeping pace with theinformation revolution.andM;The Means to an EndandM;Legislation that I have introduced, S.1742, the Federal Information ResourcesManagement Act of 1989, accomplishes these goals and more.andP;  It is designed toreduce the burden of dupplicative government paperwork for businesses,educational institutions and individuals; to strengthen the informationinfrastructure and statistical database of the federal government; to set anational information resources management policy, and to improve theefficiency and effectiveness of OMB's Office of information and RegulatoryAffairs.andM;If we are really serious about pushing the boulder of government paperworkoff the shoulders of the American public and we want a truly integrated lifecycle management of government information, Congress should move thelegislation.andM;These are formidable goals, and they must be actively confronted.andP;  If we donot address them, then the information we have created will be our nemesisrather than the advantage it was designed to be.andM;Sen.andP;  Bingaman (D-N.M.) is chairman of the Governmental Affairs Subcommitteeon Government Information and Regulation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
