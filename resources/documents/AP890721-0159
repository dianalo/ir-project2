Sen. Orin Hatch, R-Utah, is sponsoring a bill that would set a12-month limit on civil contempt of court jailings in child custodycases in the District of Columbia.   The bill would apply retroactively to Morgan, a plastic surgeonimprisoned by a judge without a trial in August 1987 after failingto produce her daughter for court-ordered visits with the girl'sfather.   ``Dr. Morgan has now served almost two years in jail,'' Hatchtold a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee that hasjurisdiction over district matters. ``My answer to that is, `Enoughis enough.'''   Morgan has alleged that Dr. Eric Foretich, her ex-husband andthe girl's father, had sexually abused seven-year-old Hilary.Foretich has repeatedly denied that.   The case has become a rallying point for women's rights andanti-child abuse groups, while Foretich has received support from anumber of men's organizations.   ``My bill takes no position on the merits of the Morgan case,but I believe in child custody cases the contempt power can beabused,'' Hatch told the committee's General Services, Federalismand the District of Columbia panel. ``We're not talking abouthardened criminals here.''   Hatch's bill is drawn more narrowly than a similar measure,passed recently by the House, which applies to all civil contemptjailings.   In both cases, after a year, a prosecutor would either bring acriminal contempt charge, requiring a trial, or the person would gofree.   A spokesman for Rep. Frank Wolf, author of the House bill, saidWolf was willing to compromise on certain issues, includingrestricting the legislation to child custody cases.   A D.C. Court of Appeals panel is reviewing Superior Court JudgeHerbert Dixon's most-recent decision to keep Morgan behind barsuntil she divulges the whereabouts of her daughter.</TEXT></DOC>
