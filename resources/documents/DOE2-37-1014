In three samples,the florencite occurs as the predominant member, while in the otherscrandallite is the main mineral. The unit-cell dimension of florencites,in two samples, measured are the same as those of the florencites fromother deposits. The rare earths occur mainly in this mineral group withpredominance of the light rare earth elements. This is well observedin the condrite normalized REE patterns. These enrichments are not regular.The geochemical characteristics of the rare earth distribution in thecrandallites of Maicuru, leads tho suggest this mineral was formed fromdistinct lithologies.</TEXT></DOC>
