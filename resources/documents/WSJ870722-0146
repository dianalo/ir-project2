YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Day of the Living Dead is upon the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.    &quot;The living dead&quot; is how regulators and others refer to hundreds of money-losing savings and loan associations -- many of them in the Southwest and the Midwest -- that remain open only because the Bank Board's Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. doesn't have the money to close them. About 460 of the nation's 3,200 federally insured thrifts are insolvent, losing more than $10 million on paper every day, and many more are on the ropes.    Congress is working on an $8.5 billion transfusion for the hemorrhaging insurance fund, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the problem far outstrips the plan, many experts say. For one thing, regulators say at least $5 billion would be needed to mop up the faltering thrifts in Texas alone, and that probably &quot;won't even get us into downtown Dallas from the airport,&quot; says Lawrence White, a member of the Bank Board.    Moreover, critics say, the legislation has a fatal flaw: It would restrict regulators' authority to close sick savings institutions. Lawmakers, under pressure from the thrift industry, are reluctant to encourage mass closings. But the longer the brain-dead thrifts remain open, the higher the eventual cost.    &quot;They're buying time, not to fix the problem, but to put it off,&quot; says Edward Kane, a professor of economics and finance at Ohio State University. The thrift industry, he says, is a &quot;de facto financial disaster, but no one will acknowledge it.&quot;    The main question, analysts say, is who will pay the bill. &quot;It's not going to come out of the depositors' hide, so it's got to come from the taxpayers' pockets,&quot; says Bert Ely, a financial consultant. &quot;Congress struck a deal with the devil back in the 1930s when it set up deposit insurance. It took a big gamble. For 50 years, they won the gamble. Now, they're losing it, and they're going to have to pay.&quot;    The FSLIC, which backs deposits totaling about $900 billion, ended 1986 with a $6.3 billion deficit and has only about $500 million in cash on hand. Yet federal auditors estimate that closing thrifts already hopelessly insolvent would cost $25 billion, and other analysts put the tab as high as $45 billion.    The congressional plan, which cleared a House-Senate conference committee early this month, would raise the $8.5 billion without dipping into Treasury funds; it would do this by selling long-term bonds financed by special assessments on insured thrifts. President Reagan, whose Treasury Department had asked for $15 billion over five years, is likely to veto the measure as inadequate to do the job. But some aid ultimately is expected to be enacted.    Backers of the conference-approved plan argue that action now will contain the worst of the troubles without tapping taxpayers or unleashing the disruption of widespread closings. Members of the influential U.S. League of Savings Institutions have led the fight to limit the new funds that the industry would have to raise. And, explains Rep. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat and a member of the conference committee who opposed the U.S. League on the matter: &quot;On this kind of arcane issue, when the local Sandamp;Ls come to you and say, 'Please,' you have to be given some pretty strong reasons to say, 'No.'&quot;    But critics argue that if the Bank Board can spend only $5 billion a year to attack a thrift-industry problem that is increasing by some $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion a year, the agency clearly won't be making much headway. &quot;To say we're only cutting into the problem at $5 billion a year means we're not cutting into the problem,&quot; says Mr. Ely, the consultant.    What concerns some experts even more is the legislation's provision, sought by the thrift industry and included at the urging of House Speaker James Wright of Texas, that would hinder federal regulators' attempts to shut down an ailing institution in timely fashion. That, experts say, could ensure that their losses -- and the cost of eventually closing them -- would continue to mount.    The conference bill specifically directs the Bank Board to relax its capital requirements for thrifts that are in trouble because of prevailing economic conditions. The bill would also set up an appeals process for a thrift to challenge regulatory decisions that could lead to its shutdown. As a result, the Bank Board could be prohibited from closing a hopelessly insolvent institution so long as its executives could blame its problems on the economy and not mismanagement.    The legislation says the policy is designed to &quot;maximize the long-term viability of the thrift industry at the lowest cost&quot; to the FSLIC by giving Sandamp;Ls breathing room until property values recover. But Mr. Ely says it &quot;is nothing more than allowing by and large insolvent and mismanaged thrifts to continue running up losses that are going to cost money.&quot;    Each day an ailing thrift is kept open, it must continue to pay interest on its deposits and cover daily operating costs. If its assets are no longer generating money and the Bank Board doesn't -- or can't -- shut it down, the cost of closing it increases about 10% each year, some analysts say.    The U.S. League wants to restrict the Bank Board's powers to close troubled thrifts out of fear that regulators would close not only hopeless Sandamp;Ls but also ones that could work themselves out of trouble. To bolster its case, the trade group cites some thrifts that have teetered on the brink of insolvency but revived through strong management. However, a study by Congress's General Accounting Office concluded earlier this year that most insolvent thrifts being kept open by the Bank Board probably won't fully recover.    &quot;They're delaying the inevitable,&quot; Ohio State's Prof. Kane says. &quot;They're taking a lottery ticket on the off-chance that they'll get well.&quot;    That bet, he says, is a long shot. The industry is divided into a profitable three-quarters and a disastrously unprofitable one-quarter. Though money-makers outnumber money-losers three to one, the profitable thrifts earned only $9.1 billion last year, a mere $400 million more than the $8.7 billion lost by the sick ones.    Nevertheless, supporters of a limited FSLIC recapitalization plan argue that costlier, more drastic action now would make problems worse. They say that if too many thrifts were liquidated at once, the flood of office and apartment buildings and other real estate onto already-depressed markets could sink economies in places such as Dallas, Houston and Denver, where empty, &quot;see-through&quot; office buildings dot the skylines.    &quot;Even the threat of something like this would have a tremendous adverse impact,&quot; says W.W. McAllister, the chairman of San Antonio Savings Association in Texas. &quot;The market's very fragile at this point; it's driven more by expectations than usual.&quot; Reverberating far beyond the thrift industry, the shock wave &quot;would affect the entire financial infrastructure here in Texas,&quot; he adds.    And although the thrift-industry crisis could easily require as much as $45 billion to resolve, there is a limit to how much the Bank Board could spend efficiently.    The agency &quot;could probably spend $5 billion in a month if it were geared up to do that,&quot; but it isn't, says Rita Fair, a former Bank Board chief of staff and now a Washington-based consultant. Earlier this year, Treasury Undersecretary George Gould told the House Banking Committee that &quot;given FSLIC's organizational constraints,&quot; $5 billion a year &quot;probably represents the maximum level of resources that FSLIC can efficiently use.&quot;    &quot;You have a shortage not just of money, but you have a shortage of people,&quot; says Richard Kneipper, a Dallas-based thrift attorney who often deals with the Bank Board. &quot;Throwing money at this problem is the wrong way to deal with it. If you don't have the people there to manage the money, you can create even a worse situation. Yes, there are serious problems, but an even worse problem would be to have people running around like chickens with their heads cut off with money sticking out of their pockets.&quot;    At this point, many experts say, no plan relying on industry financing would be sufficient, no matter how big. &quot;We're beyond the point where we can expect the healthy institutions to foot the bill for the unhealthy institutions,&quot; says James Barth, an economist at George Washington University.    And the longer a resolution of the crisis is put off, the more expensive it is likely to become as insolvent but still-operating thrifts keep piling up unrealized losses. In addition, Mr. Barth warns, managers of troubled thrifts may be tempted to &quot;gamble for resurrection,&quot; investing in risky ventures such as real-estate projects promising high returns if they succeed but threatening big losses if they fail. Further, such thrifts often have to pay high rates of interest to attract deposits, thus driving up the cost of money for all institutions.    Congress has only two real choices in looking for someone else to pick up the tab: It could merge the FSLIC with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the federal bank-deposit-insurance fund -- in effect, sticking commercial banks with the bill. Or it could dip into the Treasury, paying for the bailout with tax dollars. &quot;The taxpayer and the FDIC are on the line,&quot; says Rep. Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican and a member of the House-Senate committee.    But the FDIC's own resources are being pressed as banks fail at a record pace this year. The FDIC, which insures $1.5 trillion of deposits in 14,800 banks, has reserves of about $18.2 billion, the lowest ratio ever of the fund to insure deposits. FDIC Chairman William Seidman says he opposes a merger with the FSLIC &quot;because they're broke and we aren't.&quot;    That would leave the American taxpayer. Mr. Ely, the consultant, estimates that the thrift industry could realistically be expected to contribute only $10 billion at most. The rest would have to be borne by the Treasury.    That sum -- at least $15 billion -- could be &quot;a taxpayer bailout that will make the Farm Credit System problems look like a trip to the five-and-dime,&quot; says Rep. Thomas Carper, a Delaware Democrat on the House Banking Committee. Congress is considering a plan of loan guarantees for the Farm Credit System that probably would total about $6 billion.    That may seem like a hard choice, but Mr. Ely says it is the only logical solution. The thrift industry shouldn't pay, he says, noting that healthy competitors didn't bear the cost in previous government bailouts of private industry. &quot;After all,&quot; he says, &quot;Ford and GM didn't bail out Chrysler. Boeing didn't bail out Lockheed.&quot;    (Revised WSJ July 24, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
