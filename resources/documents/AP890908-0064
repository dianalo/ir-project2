In another development, Israeli military officials accused Syriaof being behind two recent attacks along the Israel-Jordan border,Israel radio and three newspapers reported.   The body of 30-year-old Niman Abu Hilal was brought to NasserHospital in Gaza after he was severely beaten at his home in thetown of Rafah by masked Palestinian youths, Arab reports said.   Late Thursday, the body of Jasser Al Krinawi, 24, was foundstuffed in a well in the Magazi refugee camp, reports said, addingthat he had been stabbed to death.   Both were suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities.   An army spokesman said soldiers found the body of Krinawi, whohad been reported missing since the start of August. The spokesmansaid four Arab suspects were in custody.   The spokesman also confirmed the death of a 30-year-old Arab manin Gaza. He said the man had been brought to the hospital aftersuffering a fatal beating and stab wounds. Police wereinvestigating, said the spokesman, who declined to elaborate.   The deaths raised to 109 the number of Palestinians killed byfellow Arabs since the start of the uprising against Israeli rulenearly 21 months ago. Most have been accused either ofcollaboration, prostitution or drug dealing.   In its latest leaflet, the underground leadership of the uprisingurged caution in killing collaborators, saying that accusationsshould be cleared with the leadership and that suspects should begiven an opportunity to repent and reform.   At least 559 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers orcivilians since the start of the rebellion; 39 Israelis also havedied in the violence.   Katyusha rockets fired from Jordan hit Israeli farmland Thursday,and a stray rocket apparently landed on Jordanian soil, the armysaid. No damage or injuries were reported.   Israel radio reported the attack was believed the work of theMarxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, based inSyria.   Last Saturday, a suspected Palestinian guerrilla infiltrated fromJordan, killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded another before beingfatally shot. It was the fourth infiltration along the Israel-Jordanfrontier this year, breaking a lengthy period of quiet.   The Syrian-based Taalat Yakoub faction of the PalestineLiberation Front claimed responsibility for Saturday's borderpenetration.   Zeev Schiff, a military analyst for the Haaretz daily, said Syriamay be encouraging the Palestinians to act via Jordan to punishJordan's King Hussein for assisting Iraq in moving weapons toLebanon's embattled Christians. The Lebanese Christians this summerhave been engaged in ferocious artillery duels with Syrian forcesand their Moslem allies in Lebanon.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told television's Arabiclanguage service on Thursday that ``we still do not think thatJordan's policy of ensuring the security and quiet of the borderbetween us has changed.''   But Shamir called for greater ``caution and alertness'' by Jordanto prevent further problems.   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, notedthat Jordan has recently allowed Palestine Liberation Organizationleader Yasser Arafat to reopen several offices in Amman. Theysuggested the warming of relations may be giving a signal toPalestinian groups that they are welcome to use Jordanian territoryfor acts against Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
