Statements by top U.S. monetary officials on interestrates and the release of figures on U.S. durable-goods ordersfor April caused little change in dollar rates, traders said.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. unit likewise remained little changed against itsCanadian and British counterparts in spite of the continuingconstitutional impasse in Canada and the release ofstatistics showing a wider-than-expected U.K. merchandisedeficit for April.   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quotedat 1.6765 marks, up from 1.6736 marks late Tuesday, and at151.45 yen, up from 151.20 yen late Tuesday. Sterling wasquoted at $1.6940, up from $1.6928 late Tuesday.   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency wastrading at 151.18 yen, down a bit from Wednesday's Tokyoclose of 151.35 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading inTokyo at 1.6673 marks.   Comments by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady thatsubstantial Treasury borrowing will be necessary to pay thedebt of insolvent savings-and-loan institutions had littleeffect on the dollar.   There was little reaction to the statement, said MartinMcNulty, a vice president at Lloyd's Bank in New York. Hesaid participants reasoned that any positive impact on thedollar caused by a rise in U.S. interest rates stemming fromincreased Treasury borrowing would be offset by thepotentially bearish impact of a wider U.S. federal budgetdeficit.   The impact of Mr. Brady's comments, in which he said theSandamp;L bailout could cost as much as $132 billion, was furtherdiluted because it has been widely assumed in the market thatthe cost of rescuing insolvent Sandamp;Ls would be far higher thanthe $30 billion currently authorized, Mr. McNulty said.   A statement later by Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan that the resolution of the Sandamp;L crisis will haveonly minimal effect on interest rates served to confirm themarket's initial assessment of the situation, said BillChepolis, a trader at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.   The release early in the New York day of alarger-than-expected 4.1% fall in U.S. April durable-goodsorders from March didn't affect dollar rates to a greatdegree because the market is focused on budget-deficit talkscurrently under way in Washington between the Bushadministration and Congress, dealers said. A fall of 2.2% hadbeen expected.   While the fall in orders was seen as another sign of aslowing U.S. economy, the market is more interested intoday's revision of first-quarter gross national product andits attendant price deflator because of its implications forinterest rates, participants said.   Revised first-quarter GNP is expected to show a downwardadjustment to 1.8% from an originally announced 2.1%. Theprice deflator is expected to remain at 5.7%.   Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar stabilized at slightlyhigher levels against the U.S. dollar as participants settledback following Tuesday's wild swings to assess the politicalsituation there, said Diego Giurleo, corporateforeign-exchange manager at Royal Bank of Canada in New York.   &quot;The political situation there is not out of control,&quot; Mr.Giurleo said, noting that the June 23 deadline forratification of the controversial constitutional amendment onQuebec is still a month away.   In the meantime, the Canadian unit will be volatile butthe currency will be prevented from falling too far byCanada's high interest rates, he said. As was the caseyesterday, the high rates and occasional dips in the Canadiancurrency will prove very attractive to bargain hunters, headded.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery plummeted $11.50 to $364.10 an ounce. The close wasthe lowest since Oct. 13. Estimated volume was a very heavyseven million ounces.
