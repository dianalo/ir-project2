Unrest flared in the southern republic of Azerbaijan, meanwhile,with thousands of people holding a rally and saying they wouldconcentrate their strike on key industries.   Strike leaders in Estonia's capital of Tallinn said at least20,000 Russian workers stayed off the job to protest a new law thattightens residency requirements for voters and candidates.   ``We met with strike committee representatives and they latersaid they were not satisfied with the results. If so, let's continuethe talks,'' party chief Vaino Vyalyas said in an Estonian TVinterview.   State-run Moscow Radio said the strike cost millions of dollars.   It said the Estonian law will take the right to vote away frommore than 100,000 non-Estonians in the republic of 1.6 millionpeople.   The new law limits voting to residents who have lived in the samedistrict for two years, or anywhere in Estonia for five years.Candidates must live in the same place for five years, or in Estoniafor 10 years.   Strike committee member Alexei Kutenyov said by telephone thatwork had at least partially halted at 46 of the republic'sbusinesses, mainly in Tallinn and in the mining town ofKohtla-Jarve. Tass said about 20 businesses in Tallinn and 10 inKohtla-Jarve were affected.   Cargo railcars were piling up at Tallinn stations because trainworkers were on strike, and the state airline Aeroflot was carryingonly emergency supplies and passengers, the labor daily Trud said.   Vyalyas admitted the rights of Estonia's minorities, whom he didnot identify but presumably including Russians, had not been takeninto account. ``This is our mistake and it must be corrected,'' hesaid.   The striking Russians, most of whom work in industrial plants,also object to a new national decision to give Estonia free reinover its economy. The workers are demanding that factories with apredominantly Russian-speaking labor force remain the property ofthe national government rather than be handed over to Estonia.   In Azerbaijan, an estimated 10,000-15,000 people demonstrated inthe capital of Baku on Monday night and decided to make their strikethat began earlier in the day more selective, said activist AidinAmirbekov.   Amirbekov, a member of the People's Front of Azerbaijan thatcalled the strike, said the protesters decided to concentrate thewalkout on vital industries such as an oil processing equipmentplant, while returning to work in light industry, which producesconsumer goods.   Amirbekov said by telephone from Baku that one of the strikers'demands is that the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh bereturned to Azerbaijan. The Kremlin placed the region under itsauthority in January.   Predominantly Shiite Moslem Azerbaijan has been embroiled in adispute with neighboring Armenia, whose population is mainlyChristian, over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but its population ispredominantly Armenian, and Armenia wants to annex it.   Armenians have been striking in Nagorno-Karabakh for four months,and ethnic violence, including use of home-made bombs, hascontinued, Tass said Monday. Last year, nearly 100 people werekilled in Armenia and Azerbaijan in violence stemming from theterritorial dispute.   ``Loss of life and the number of casualties among the Armenianand Azerbaijani population and servicemen is growing,'' the newsagency said, without providing details.   The region has been blockaded, with transportation disrupted byextremists who are sabotaging highways and railways, Tass said.   Food is reaching the region only because soldiers are guardingshipments and ``the population is in constant fear,'' the newsagency reported.   Political problems also are severe it said, adding that ``thereare unconstitutional attempts to create an alternative structure ofgovernment bodies, calls for civil disobedience, for outright armedstruggle.''   Senior Interior Ministry officials are helping local authorities``take additional measures to prevent unlawful actions, cut shortacts of sabotage, interethnic clashes and mass disturbances, toensure safety of people,'' Tass said. It did not say what new actionwas taken.   In Baku, an editor said workers walked out Monday at sixfactories: an oil equipment plant, a steel plant, a sewing factoryand three smaller machine-tool works.   Of Baku's estimated 1 million workers, perhaps 1 percent joinedthe stoppage, said Saveli Peretz, deputy chief of Azerinform, theofficial Azerbaijani news agency.   ``It's a very small number,'' Peretz said by telephone.</TEXT></DOC>
