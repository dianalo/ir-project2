The CH-46 Sea Knight from Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Stationcrashed Wednesday into water about 30 feet deep a mile off theisland of Oahu, said Chief Warrant Officer Eric R. Carlson, aMarine spokesman.   Three helicopters searched unsuccessfully for the crew untilsunset, with the search continuing at night with a Coast Guardcutter. An air search was scheduled to resume again at dawn, hesaid.   Marine divers located wreckage on the sea bed, but were unableto find the helicopter's crew, Carlson said.   Carlson said repair crews had removed the helicopter's rotorblades and reinstalled them during routine maintenance. He said thecrew had taken the chopper out for a test flight to make sure theblades were in balance.   ``It started falling and I saw something fall off of it _ maybeit was the tail part that fell,'' said Carolyn Kam, who saw thecrash through a window.   Kam, a newscaster at radio station KRTR, said the craft wassmoking as it fell to the water.   The helicopter was attached to the Marine Medium HelicopterSquadron 262, one of five squadrons based at Kaneohe.   The CH-46 has been out of production since 1971, after ordersdeclined with the end of the Vietnam War, said Robert Torgerson,spokesman for Boeing Helicopters in Philadelphia.   It has been used by the Marines since the early 1960s as a trooptransport aircraft, and the Navy has also used it to airliftsupplies, Torgerson said.   Since discontinuing production, Boeing has made kits to maintainthe reliability of the helicopter and extend its life into the1990s, he said.   Torgerson said there has been no history of mechanical problemswith the CH-46, although ``all aircraft that operate for that longhave had some incidents.''</TEXT></DOC>
