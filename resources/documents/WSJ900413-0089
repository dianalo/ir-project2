After a 1 1/2-year debate, the Securities and ExchangeCommission next Thursday is expected to pass a rule thatcould exempt billions of dollars in new securities offeringsfrom disclosure rules.</LP><TEXT>   The chief beneficiaries will be big institutionalinvestors, corporate issuers and Wall Street investmentbankers. Individual investors, on the other hand, won't gain;they will be barred from buying any of the expected crop ofnew securities. And there are risks for buyers in a marketwith less-stringent disclosure requirements.   The SEC's new Rule 144a would exempt U.S. and foreigninstitutions from registration requirements for the sale ofbonds and stocks to any institution already holding at least$100 million in securities.   These securities are sold in the private-placement market,which is limited to institutions; individual investors areshut out of this private market, which is largely used tosell corporate debt.   In effect, the SEC is expected to allow large players totrade among themselves without going back to the registrationand disclosure process. This step could vastly enlarge thevolume of bonds and stocks sold in the private-placementmarket, although the market isn't likely to mushroomovernight.   The rule would put a stamp of approval on a process thatthe SEC has tacitly allowed over the years among manyinstitutions in the private market. By codifying theseinformal practices, the SEC will create a safe harbor that isexpected to draw into the market institutions that had beenreluctant to venture forth without regulatory guidance.   &quot;The whole character of the private-placement market willchange,&quot; says Sara Hanks, who until recently headed the SEC'sinternational corporate finance unit.   The rule has several important implications. It's expectedto attract droves of foreign companies to the U.S. markets toraise capital; foreign concerns have largely avoided themarketplace here because of stringent American disclosurerules.   And the rule could make U.S. markets more competitive, bylowering financing costs and keeping U.S. companies fromheading overseas to finance themselves.   Equally important, the rule is likely to bolster liquidity-- the ease with which securities can be bought and sold inthe secondary, or resale, market for private placements.   But the rule will be no panacea. That's becauserestrictions on snapping up private securities still existamong many of the expected buyers.   Mutual funds generally can't invest more than 10% of theirassets in so-called restricted securities such as privateplacements. And state law doesn't allow insurance companiesto buy private securities in a big way: New York state, forexample, prohibits insurance firms from putting more than 1%of their assets in foreign securities. Until the restrictionsare lifted, some say, the rule's impact will be blunted.   &quot;The $64,000 question is: How long is it going to take toget buyers to come to the party, and how many will come oncethey decide what the party is?&quot; says Curtis Welling, amanaging director at First Boston Corp.   Says Robert Pozen, general counsel for FidelityInvestments, the nation's biggest mutual-fund group: &quot;It'snot going to be a huge revolution, but a modest evolution.&quot;   The rule may create yet another barrier for smallinvestors, who can't trade these securities. By greatlyexpanding the market to which individual investors lackaccess, critics say, it will allow the big boys to use theirsize and clout to create even more favorable deals than theyalready get.   There are risks, too: Just because an institution holds aboatload of money doesn't necessarily make it a smartinvestor. Many large thrifts proved that. And the moneythat's at risk in a big pension fund ultimately belongs tosmall investors.   As a result, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden is consideringseeking to impose an additional barrier for banks andthrifts, by setting minimum net capital standards. Mr.Breeden, a veteran of the thrift bailout, is said to beconcerned about the sophistication of banks and thrifts. TheSEC won't offer this proposal next Thursday, however.   Says Monte Wetzler, an attorney for Breed, Abbott andamp;Morgan, a New York law firm: &quot;The underlying assumption isthat institutions are sophisticated enough to deal with thelack of disclosure.&quot;   Despite a lack of regulation, there is often moredisclosure in the private market than for publicly tradedsecurities, some securities executives contend. JeromeGreene, a managing director at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., says &quot;thevery personal process&quot; of negotiating deals in the privatemarket ensures that institutions receive adequateinformation. Of course, institutions that want moredisclosure can demand a better rate or simply walk away.   The rule couldn't come at a better time for Wall Street.Stung by a deep recession, securities firms hope the ruleeventually will be a shot in the arm. It also could helprevive the private-placement market by removing theregulatory uncertainties that have deterred some companiesfrom using it.   After booming throughout the 1980s, private placementshave slowed recently amid the collapse of the junk-bondmarket. Nearly 82% of the $165 billion in securities soldthrough private placements last year was corporate debt,according to IDD Information Services.   But there will be outcasts from this market under whateverrule the SEC passes: companies whose stock or debt already islisted on an exchange or quoted over the counter.   The result nevertheless will be a chance for institutionsto freely swap massive blocks of securities. &quot;The impact isalready occurring, much like {preparations for} 1992 inEurope,&quot; says John Miller, an executive vice president atEquitable Capital Management Corp. in New York. &quot;Foreignissuers already are coming into the market more often. Thepace has picked up in the past year or so.&quot;   The firms most likely to benefit from the new rule will bethose with the biggest international presences, includingMorgan Stanley Group Inc., First Boston and Salomon Inc.,specialists say.   Among other things, the new rule is ideal for sovereignand semi-sovereign debt, executives say, because of the highquality of the issues. A debt offering in the private marketlikely to test the effect of the new rule is one by the StateBank of India. Philip Bennett, a director for capital marketsat Salomon Brothers, says the India debt placement, and anexpected issue for the State Bank of South Australia, &quot;willbe precursors of 144a offerings.&quot;   Moreover, the rule also might open up a market for easilytrading controlling interests in companies that have beentaken private in leveraged buy-outs. In that way, it couldprovide an alternative for LBO owners who don't want to takethe companies public again to get their money out.   Frederick Zuckerman, vice president and treasurer atChrysler Corp., said he thinks finance companies could emergeas the most frequent users of the new private market. He saysthe market would be ripe for &quot;the guys who come to the partyevery other week for $100 million or so.&quot; He adds: &quot;I justthink it makes life a little easier for people who use thecapital markets.&quot;   The New York Stock Exchange, meanwhile, may face pressureto upgrade its trading systems. That's because the SEC alsois expected next Thursday to approve a new automated tradingsystem by the National Association of Securities Dealers thatthe NASD hopes will serve as the central marketplace forprivately placed securities.   The system, dubbed Portal -- for Private Offerings,Resales and Trading through Automated Linkages -- will beable to handle any bond or stock exempted from SECregistration under Rule 144a.   ---             How the Non-Public Market Stacks Up                                                                                                                     The Growth in Offerings Slows...
