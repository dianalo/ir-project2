 You'resitting there sipping your coffee, thinking great thoughts, when wham!andO;somebody thrusts a sheaf of unmistakably legal-looking documents at you.andP;  Or,as happens increasingly these days, it simply arrives in the mail.andP;  Eitherway, you get a singal that in some fashion or another you've been draggedinto a court proceeding.andM;Frequently, an immediate problem confronting you at this point--unless you'vehad previous experience with legal matters or happen to have studied law--isthat the documents themselves appear incomprehensible.andP;  (Even worse, they maynot actually mean what they seem to say.)andP;  Obviously, it's time to consult alawyer.andP;  Trouble is, there may not be one at hand, and you can do an awfullot of worrying in the interim--often unnecessarily.andP;  It can help a greatdeal if you already have a general idea of the true significance of theseominous-looking papers.andM;Even when you do get a chance to spread the documents before a sympatheticattorney, some background knowledge is useful.andP;  Many lawyers--perhaps most,unfortunately--simply assume hat non-lawyers are already familiar with basiccourt terminology and procedures, even though the rest of us know this is notusually the case.andP;  So unless you're lucky enough to hook up with apractitioner who understands this basic fact of life, and in additionpossesses a knack for explaining legal matters in erms that arecomprehensible to non-lawyers (a knack that is all too rare, alas) you couldemerge from the session nearly as confused as before.andP;  Since we're beginninga bright new year, this seems like an appropriate time to ameliorate thisproblem.andM;To start with, we must keep in mind that in the US the federal government, 50semi-sovereign states, and seveal territories all comprise separate legaljurisdictions with their own court systems and procedures.andP;  (This, by theway, is one of the wo distinct legal meanings given the word &quot;jurisdiction&quot;;we'll encounter the other shortly.)andP;  Because of our multiple jurisdictions,we'll have to generalize, using the most widely encountered terminology.andO;Remember, though, that the names of equivalent documents may be different inyour state.andM;The papers that launch a lawsuit are collectively known as the pleadings, andthe persons or other entities directly involved in the suit are called theparties.andP;  The process begins with one party filing a complaint with te courtclerk.andP;  The party doing the filing becomes the plaintiff.andP;  The other partybecomes the defendant, or in some instances, the respondent.andP;  The complaintis the formidable document you'll get if you're on the receiving end of alawsuit.andM;Back in the days when the hoary rules of English common law dictatedrequirements for pleadings, drawing up a complaint was a sticky matterindeed.andP;  For example, if you chose the wrong term to describe the nature ofyour grievance against the other party, you were tossed out of court, andthat was that.andP;  Today, American jurisdictions have greatly liberalized theseharsh common-law pleading requirements, though some states retain much of theterminology.andP;  NEvertheless, drawing up a proper complaint remains tricky.andM;The first thing a complaint does is identify the parties to the lawsuit.andO;Sometimes, though, fictitious names are used, like &quot;John Doe&quot; or &quot;Does Onethrough Five.&quot;andP;  Next, the complaint spells out the basis for the suit, whichis known as a cause of action (a complaint can contain more than one cause ofaction).andP;  Finally, it will ask that the court take some kind of action, suchas awarding money damages, or perhaps placing the other party under a legalinjunction; this portion of the complaint is called a prayer.andM;Seems simple enough, but it really isn't.andP;  For example, a cause of actionmust be set forth in a certain way, and this differs from jurisdiction tojurisdiction.andP;  Easiest to read, but not necessarily to draft, is the formrequired by the federal courts.andP;  (These tribunals are of particularimportance to the computing industry, since most of the major lawsuitsinvolving it are conducted there.)andP;  For example, a portion of a cause ofaction contained in a complaint filed in federal court might read somethinglike this:andM;After January 15, 1990, defendant infringed plaintiff's copyright by placingupon the market a software program entitled Goliathwrite, which was copiedlargely from plaintiff's copyrighted program, SuperAcme.andM;In a number of states, however, a considerably embellished form of pleadingincorporating ultimate facts is still used, so you might read something likethis:andM;Defendant's conduct in acquiring plaintiff's trade secret was in willfuldisregard of plaintiff's rights therein, was fraudulent, and was accompaniedby malice and oppression.andM;It can be a bit difficult to figure out exactly what the suit is about fromthis sort of pleading.andM;Specialized types of lawsuits exist in some jurisdictions.andP;  One of particularinterest to the computing industry that can be brought in the federal courts(and also in a number of states) is the action for declaratory relief.andP;  Thisis, in effect, a preemptive strike by a party that recognizes it's about tobe sued--for copyright infringement, let's say.andP;  The Intel/NEC litigationbegan this way (see &quot;Rules of the Game&quot;, UNIX REVIEW, Vol.andP;  7 No.andP;  4).andP;  NECbeat Intel to the punch by seeking a ruling that Intel's microcode copyrightswere invalid--or, if not, that NEC's microcode didn't infringe on them.andP;  Theparty that wins the race to the clerk's office can gain certain advantages,which include selecting the court in which the lawsuit will take place (inlegal parlance, the venue).andM;When the complaint is served on the defendant it is accompanied by anotherdocument called a summons.andP;  This is an order from the court commanding you,in essence, to appear and defend yourself against the lawsuit.andP;  (This is agood place to mention something else most people aren't aware of: orders ofthe court are ordinarily prepared by one of the parties, and then presentedto the clerk--or possibly directly to the judge--to be officially issued.andO;The summons is no exception.)andM;If the documents that have been served upon you don't seem to fall into thecategories I've just discussed, they probably have some other purpose; we'lldiscuss the likeliest possibilities a little later.andP;  Assuming you have beenserved with papers initiating a lawsuit against you, you--or, most likely,your lawyer--will have to make some critical decisions, and there usuallywon't be much time to make them.andM;For example, sometimes it is in your best interest not to go into the courtto counter the plaintiff's allegations.andP;  To understand why, we must considerthe other legal meaning of the term &quot;jurisdiction&quot;.andM;In this second sense, &quot;jurisdiction&quot; refers to a court's legal authority todo particular things.andP;  A court must, for instance, have jurisdiction over thesubject matter of a lawsuit, or else its actions will be fatally defective.andO;For example, state courts do not have subject-matter jurisdiction overcopyrights or patents.andP;  The lack of this type of jurisdiction may come up atany time, and this sort of jurisdictional defect can't be waived by theparties.andM;There are other situations, however, where the parties can conferjurisidction on a court that it otherwise wouldn't have.andP;  Let's considerdivorce proceedings, for example.andP;  Here, if the partner filing for divorcehas met the legal requirements for residence in a state, its courts havejurisdiction over the marriage relationship itself, because it's considered adiscrete entity.andP;  The court can enter a valid decree dissolving the marriage,which must be honored by other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clauseof the Constitution.andP;  This is known as in rem jurisdiction.andM;Now let's suppose that the other partner to the marriage resides in adifferent state, and neither files an answer to the divorce complaint norparticipates in any other way in the court proceedings.andP;  In that event, thecourt would lack jurisdiction to make any sort of binding order directed atthe absent partner personally--such as an order to pay alimony, or an orderdepriving that partner of child custody.andP;  In order to do these things, thecourt must have whaths known as in personam jurisdiction, which it lacks inthis instance because the absent partner is outside its territorialjurisdiction and hasn't voluntarily submitted him or herself to the court'sauthority.andP;  But in personam jurisdiction can be conferred upon a court thatotherwise wouldn't have it--by the defendant's filing a responsive answer,for example.andM;Now we can begin to appreciate why deciding upon the response to a complaintcan be delicate matter.andP;  You can file special pleadings for the purpose ofchallenging a court's jurisdiction, without thereby submitting yourself toits authority.andP;  Even where the court's jurisdiction is clear, you might notwant to file an answer right away.andP;  Some jurisdictions (using the firstmeaning of the term again) permit you to file the common-law pleading knownas a demurrer to call the court's attention to some defect in the complaint.andO;If your demurrer is sustained, the plaintiff then has to try to correct thedefect--unless it's one of the rare instances in which a demurrer issustained without leave to amend, in which case it's all over.andM;A common basis for a demurrer can be summarized by the phrase, &quot;Sowhat?&quot;--meaning that even if everything stated in the complaint turned out tobe true, it still wouldn't constitute a legally recognized cause of action.andO;Jurisdictions that don't allow demurrers generally permit this kind ofdefense to be raised in other pleadings, including the motion to strike, orperhaps in the answer itself.andM;Answers may be relatively simple documents merely denying the allegations ofthe complaint, or they can be formidable pleadings in their own right.andP;  Thelatter obtains when an answer incorporates a counterclaim, which is a lawsuitbrought by the defendant against the plaintiff.andP;  Counterclaims are invariablyfiled when the lawsuit has begun as an action for declaratory relief, and arequite common in other types of lawsuits as well.andP;  A counterclaim is a form ofcomplaint, really, and puts the other party in the position of deciding whatit is going to do by way of response.andM;When all of these initial pleadings have finally been filed, the party'sbarely begun.andP;  Next comes the stage where third parties--hapless bystanders,perhaps--can find themselves receiving court papers.andM;In the days of the old common-law procedures, trials of lawsuits were playedout in the tradition of shootouts at the O.K.andP;  Corral, because neither sideknew what sort of evidence the other was going to produce.andP;  Today, we have aset of pre-trial procedures collectively known as discovery.andP;  These includedepositions, in which prospective witnesses are subponenaed to appear infront of a court reporter to be questioned by the opposing lawyers.andP;  Thesecan be quite a pain for the witnesses, who often find it prudent to bringtheir own lawyers along.andP;  Discovery also involves the examination of records,which may require that documents be obtained from third parties by means ofsubpoenas duces tecum.andM;This means that if the documents served on you don't appear to be calculatedto make you a party to a lawsuit, they're probably for the purpose ofobtaining either your testimony or your records.andP;  The lengthier the document,the more likely it's the latter.andP;  Examine it closely; if it tells you toappear at such-and-such a place on or before a certain date and to bring withyou the following, it may only be necessary to send in copies of thespecified records--at the requesting party's expense.andP;  Assuming thesubpoenaed material is innocuous (so that you have no objection to revealingit), a phone call to the office of the lawyer seeking the items may give youinformation explaining how to comply painlessly with the subpoena.andM;In the meantime, the parties to the lawsuit will not have ignored each other.andO;Thanks to the wonderful capabilities of computers, they will most likely bebombarding their respective opponents with page after page of burdensomeinquires, called interrogatories.andP;  Since the laws require that these beanswered, or at least recognized, the best thing to do is turn these papersover to your lawyer and hope he or she doesn't charge too high an hourlyrate.andM;I think we've covered most of the documents that are likely to come your wayduring the beginning stages of a lawsuit.andP;  Do I hear you asking about thetrial?andP;  Oh, don't even think about that yet; it's still a long way off.andO;First, there'll probably be a request for a temporary restraining order todeal with, and then the hearing on the preliminary injunction--itself acrucial proceeding in intellectual property suits, by the way.andP;  Then there'llbe settlement conferences, and pretrials, and someday, finally, the realtrial.andP;  Assuming you live so long.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law.andP;  He also has served as an administrative lawjudge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
