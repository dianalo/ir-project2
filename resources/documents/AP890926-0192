The rebels have agreed to peace talks and a communique saidTuesday's actions were in response to government repression.   The communique, broadcast on the rebels' clandestine radiostation, called the attacks a ``Halt the repression!'' offensiveand said it was ordered because of the arrests of dozens ofunionists.   Military officials said guerrillas attacked targets in nine ofEl Salvador's 14 provinces. They listed the casualties as 26guerrillas and 13 soldiers killed and 18 soldiers, 15 guerrillasand 6 civilians wounded.   It was the broadest rebel offensive since May 10 when theguerrillas attacked positions in 10 provinces. And it was the firstseries of coordinated attacks by the guerrillas since governmentand rebel representatives held preliminary peace talks in MexicoCity Sept. 13-15.   An 11-day cease-fire declared unilaterally by the rebels endedSunday.   The rebel communique spoke of the ``fascist brutality'' of therightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani, referring toaccusations by detainees that they were tortured and raped lastweek at National Police headquarters.   It said in part, ``Just as we have been flexible and broadmindedin order to negotiate, we are likewise completely disposed to, andcapable of accompanying the struggle of the entire people.''   The document was signed by the five main rebel commanders,including Joaquin Villalobos and Schafik Handal took part in theMexico City peace talks.   Another round of negotiations is to take place in Costa RicaOct. 16-17.   Cristiani's government has denied the allegations of brutatlityand said it acted legitimately against the unionists becauseparticipants in their march last week burned two buses.   All but 18 of the 71 unionists detained had been released byTuesday. Those still in custody have been charged with terrorism,subversive activity and illegal association.   The rebel communique also accused the government of takingadvantage of the guerrilla cease-fire to move troops intorebel-controlled areas and to bombard civilian zones in the northand east.   A 10-year-old civil war between the Marxist-led Farabundo MartiNational Liberation Front and a succession of U.S.-backedgovernments has taken an estimated 70,000 lives, with most of thevictims civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
