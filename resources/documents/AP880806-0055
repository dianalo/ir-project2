The cones, about six inches high, were arranged to form a``ban-the-bomb'' symbol, containing the likeness of a mushroomcloud. Organizers said the cones _ obtained from a Virginia textilemill _ were designed to represent a fraction of the 50,000 warheadsstockpiled between the superpowers.   ``We use all these textile cones to give people an idea of atleast what 30,000 looks like,'' said Pat Jackson, an organizer ofthe protest..   ``Our demonstration today is part of raising the public'sconsciousness. I think we get very accepting and just used to allthe nuclear weapons out there. We're here to poke at people,''Jackson said.</TEXT></DOC>
