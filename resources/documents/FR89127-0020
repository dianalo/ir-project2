Background </ITAG>The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act(CERCLA) was enacted in 1980 and launched the nation's first centralizedand substantial commitment to clean up hazardous waste sites. CERCLA, orSuperfund, provided Federal authority and resources to respond directlyto releases (or threatened releases) of hazardous substances that couldendanger human health or the environment. The law also authorized enforcementaction and cost recovery from those responsible for a release. The SuperfundAmendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) was enacted on October 17, 1986and continued the program initiated by CERCLA by reauthorizing CERCLA foran additional five years. SARA strengthened and expanded the cleanup programand increased the size of the Hazardous Substance Superfund by $8.5 billion.One of the vehicles EPA uses to conduct Superfund cleanup responses isa cooperative agreement, through which EPA authorizes recipients to performthe lead role for cleanup activities. Superfund cooperative agreementsare unique among EPA cooperative agreements; the major difference is thecost recovery requirement. To expedite the process of recovering costsfrom parties responsible for a release, the Superfund program mandatessite-specific tracking of costs incurred under cooperative agreements andmaintenance of site-specific files to document such costs.  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently revised OMB CircularA-102 by establishing a government-wide ``common rule'' which prescribesadministrative requirements for Federal assistance awards to States, politicalsubdivisions thereof, and Federally-recognized Indian Tribes. EPA is implementingthe common rule through 40 CFR Part 31. However, as provided in 40 CFR31.5, Part 31 does not supersede administrative provisions required bystatute.  Consistent with this Part 31 exception, EPA is promulgating this interimfinal rule as 40 CFR Part 35, Subpart O to implement the cost recoveryprogram under section 107 of CERCLA, as amended. Section 107 of CERCLAmakes any person responsible for a release or threatened release of hazardoussubstances liable for all costs of removal or remedial action. EPA implementsthis statutory provision through its cost recovery program. To ensure aneffective cost recovery program, Subpart O establishes specific uniformrequirements which supplement those in Part 31 for Superfund cooperativeagreements and Superfund State contracts (SSC's) in three ways.  The first way in which this subpart supplements Part 31 is that it providesrequirements specific to CERCLA, as amended, which were not addressed inPart 31. For example, the regulation adds requirements for States to followfor non- State-lead responses. Second, this subpart includes requirementswhich, although addressed in Part 31, do not meet the minimum standardsnecessary to meet the goal of cost recovery. These minimum requirementshave been included in this subpart in a modified form. For example, althoughPart 31 does address procurement procedures, recipients must follow theprocurement requirements in andSection; 35.6550 through andSection; 35.6610of this subpart when procuring products or services under Superfund cooperativeagreements. Finally, this subpart references those existing 40 CFR Part31 requirements which are applicable for recipients of CERCLA funds. Forexample, recipients must follow the allowable cost requirements containedin 40 CFR 31.22, which are referenced in andSection; 35.6250(a)(2) of thissubpart.  Those sections of Part 31 that Subpart O references which are applicablefor CERCLA funded cooperative agreements and/or Superfund State Contractsare listed below:<ITAG tagnum="25">31.3 Definitions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.6 Additions and exceptions: selected sections.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.13 Principal statutory provisions applicable to EPA assistanceawards.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.20 Standards for financial management systems: source documentationand awarding agency review.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.21 Payment: Basic standard, reimbursement, effect of program income,refunds, audit recoveries on payment, withholding payments, and cash depositories. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.22 Allowable costs.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.23 Period of availability of funds.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.24 Matching or cost sharing: qualifications and exceptions, andvaluation of donated services.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.25 Program income.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.26 Non-Federal audit.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.30 Changes.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.31 Real property.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.34 Copyrights.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.35 Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.36 Procurement: Selected sections from procurement standards, contractingwith MBE's/WBE's and small businesses, bonding requirements, and paymentto consultants.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.40 Monitoring by grantees.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.41 Financial reporting.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.42 Starting dates for records retention period and requirementsfor records access.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.43 Enforcement.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.44 Termination for convenience.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.45 Quality assurance.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.50 Closeout.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.51 Labor disallowances and adjustments.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.52 Collection of amounts due.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">31.70 Disputes.</ITAG>The requirements in this subpart do not apply to Technical Assistance Grantsor CERCLA research and development grants, including Superfund InnovativeTechnology Evaluation (SITE) Demonstration cooperative agreements.  <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description of Major Issues  </ITAG>A. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan(NCP)  Although CERCLA, as amended, is the legislative initiative that providesfor the cleanup of hazardous waste, the National Oil and Hazardous SubstancesPollution Contingency Plan (NCP) describes the guidelines and proceduresfor implementing CERCLA. The NCP is currently being revised to includethe statutory requirements established by SARA. Subpart O references specificsections of CERCLA, as amended, in prescribing requirements. Upon finalpromulgation of the revised NCP, any terms defined in both this regulationand the NCP will be superseded by the definition found in the NCP.  B. Records Retention  <ITAG tagnum="81">Length of Retention </ITAG>40 CFR Part 31 establishes a three-year records retention requirement forthe recipients of assistance agreements (40 CFR 31.42). In addition, Part31 specifies that if any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or otheraction involving the records has been started before the expiration ofthe three-year period, the records must be retained until completion ofthe action and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until theend of the regular three-year period, whichever is later. Subpart O requiresthat recipients retain all records for ten years after the date of completionof all response actions at the site, or until any litigation, claim, negotiation,audit, cost recovery, or other action involving the records has been completedand all issues resolved, whichever is later. This requirement ensures thatresponse action information remains available for a sufficient period tosupport government cost recovery cases. The ten-year requirement supersedesall Superfund guidance documents which specify a three-year retention period,including <T3>State Superfund Financial Management and Recordkeeping Guidance, </T3>datedJanuary 1988. Subpart O also requires the recipient to obtain written approvalfrom its EPA award official before disposing of any CERCLA records. <ITAG tagnum="81">Method of Retention</ITAG>Recipients may substitute microform copies for original supporting documentationfor removal actions and remedial investigations, feasibility studies, designs,and any additional related activities (including financial and cost accountingrecords) undertaken pursuant to CERCLA. The microform copying must be performedin accordance with the technical regulations concerning micrographics ofFederal Government records (36 CFR 1230 et seq.) and EPA records managementprocedures (EPA Order 2160). If the recipient decides to use microformcopies, then the recipient must also perform microform copying of originaldocuments periodically in the regular course of business, and may disposeof these records only upon EPA approval. Subpart O requires the recipientto obtain written approval from EPA before disposing of the original recordswhich were used to make the microform copy. Records retention requirementsspecified in this subpart are applicable to mircoform.C. Purchase of PropertyAlthough Subpart O provides the recipient with an option for obtainingequipment with CERCLA funds, it is not EPA's intent to use the HazardousSubstance Superfund to finance large purchases of equipment indiscriminantly.Therefore, the recipient must meet stringent requirements before EPA willallow the purchase of equipment with CERCLA funds. EPA encourages the recipientto use its own funds to purchase equipment, and charge the cooperativeagreement for its use. Although EPA must approve this usage rate, the recipientdoes not then have to comply with the other property standards or dispositionrequirements of this regulation, if the recipient buys the equipment withits own funds.D. Superfund State Contracts (SSC's)There are two types of Superfund State Contracts (SSC's). The first isa two-party SSC between EPA and the State which is required pursuant toCERCLA section 104 to obtain the State's CERCLA 104 assurances before aFederal-lead remedial action can begin. The second type of SSC is a three-partySSC between EPA, the State, and a political subdivision thereof, whichis required before a political subdivision receives a cooperative agreementfor remedial response at a site. In this instance, a three-party SSC isrequired before a political subdivision takes the lead for any phase ofremedial response to ensure adequate State involvement during remedialresponse pursuant to section 121(f)(1) of CERCLA. Prior to a politicalsubdivision taking the lead for remedial action, the three-party SSC mustbe amended to include the State's CERCLA 104 assurances, if not alreadyprovided in the SSC.E. Non Site-Specific Cost AccountingThe recipient of CERCLA funds is required to account for costs on a site-specificbasis by phase of activity. The recipient is not required to track expensesby site for pre-remedial or Core Program cooperative agreement activities.However, for pre-remedial activities (i.e. Preliminary Assessments andSite Inspections), the recipient is required to track expenses by a singleSuperfund account number designated specifically for the pre-remedial activity.In addition, the recipient is required to track site-specific technicalhours spent for the pre-remedial activity. For Core Program activities,the recipient is required to track expenses by a single Superfund accountnumber designated specifically for Core Program activities.F. Credit for NPL sitesThis regulation addresses requirements for obtaining credit in andSection;35.6270(c), which describes the requirements for expenditures incurredbefore a site is listed on the NPL and for those incurred after a siteis listed on the NPL. Section 104(c)(5)(A) of CERCLA, as amended, grantscredit for amounts expended by a State for remedial action at a NPL sitepursuant to a contract or cooperative agreement. In addition, section 104(c)(5)(B)allows credit for expenses for remedial action at a site incurred beforethe site is listed on the NPL if the site is subsequently listed on theNPL, and the expenses are determined to be creditable.G. Federally-recognized Indian TribesCERCLA requires EPA to afford to Federally-recognized Indian Tribes substantiallythe same treatment as it would to States. However, in order to clarifythe Supefund administrative requirements, the term ``State'' in this regulationdoes not mean ``Federally-recognized Indian Tribe.'' Where a requirementapplies only to a State, the term ``State'' is used, and where a requirementapplies only to a Federally-recognized Indian Tribe, the term ``Federally-recognizedIndian Tribe'' is used.A Federally-recognized Indian Tribe may be the lead or support agency fora response and, under the terms of the statute, need not provide the section104(c)(3) assurances with regard to remedial actions.H. Financial Status ReportAlthough the Financial Status Report form (SF-269) does not request informationby site and activity, the recipient must continue to provide financialinformation by site and activity in order to support cost recovery.I. Support Agency Cooperative AgreementsUnder the Superfund program, States and Federally-recognized Indian Tribesmay receive funding to perform site-specific activities to support a Federal-leadresponse. Since the State or Federally-recognized Indian Tribe performsthese activities as the support agency, the cooperative agreement whichfunds this assistance is termed a support agency cooperative agreement.This regulation codifies the requirements for recipients of support agencycooperative agreements in andSection; 35.6900 through 35.6920 of this subpart.An example of support agency activities that may be funded under a cooperativeagreement is the review and comment on technical data and reports relatingto implementation of the remedy.J. Non-Time-Critical RemovalsBecause there must be sufficient time to complete a cooperative agreementbefore a State or Federally-recognized Indian Tribe may take the lead,generally only non-time-critical removal actions will be eligible for cooperativeagreements. Non-time-critical removals are those where, based on the siteevaluation, the lead agency determines that a removal action is appropriateand that there is a planning period of more than six months available beforeon-site activities must begin.K. Twenty-Year Waste CapacityThe regulation includes the assurance regarding availability of hazardouswaste treatment and disposal facilities as required by CERCLA section 104(c)(9).EPA intends to issue guidance on this assurance in the near future.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.

Impact Analyses</ITAG>A. FederalismAs explained in E.O.12612, Federalism, States possess unique constitutionalauthority, resources, and competence. Under Federalism, States should begiven the maximum administrative discretion possible with respect to nationalprograms they administer. However, due to statutory cost recovery requirementsand the need to carefully track all costs, Superfund recipients must complywith administrative requirements sufficient to meet the cost recovery provisionsof CERCLA. Therefore, States must follow the additional requirements inthis rule, which are absolutely crucial for effective cost recovery fromparties responsible for release. Nonetheless, States will be able to followtheir own procedures, such as for procurement, if they certify that theirrequirements meet the intent of our regulation.B. Executive Order 12291Executive Order No. 12291 requires that regulations be classified as ``major''or ``non-major'' for purposes of review by the Office of Management andBudget (OMB). According to Executive Order No. 12291, ``major'' rules areregulations that are likely to result in:(1) An annual adverse (cost) effect on the economy of $100 million or more;or(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government, or geographical regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on the competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.This rule does not affect the amount of funds provided in the Superfundprogram, but rather modifies and updates administrative and proceduralrequirements. We do not believe that the rule will have an annual economicimpact of $100 million or more, will increase costs or prices, or willadversely affect competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. For this reason, we have determinedthat this is not a major rule within the meaning of the Order, and thereforeno formal Regulatory Impact Analysis is necessary. This interim final rulewas submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for its review asrequired by Executive Order No. 12291.C. Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) requires that, for eachrule with ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities,'' an analysis be prepared describing the rule's impact on smallentities and identifying any significant alternatives to the rule thatwould minimize the economic impact on small entities. We certify that thisrule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities because the requirements in this regulation apply onlyto States, political subdivisions thereof, and Indian Tribes for administeringSuperfund response actions.D. Paperwork Reduction ActSections 35.6055 (a) (1) through (a) (3) and (b) (1) through (b) (2); 35.6105(a) (1) through (a) (5) and (b); 35.6250 (a) (1) and (b); 35.6300 (a) (3);35.6315 (c); 35.6320 (a); 35.6340(a) (3); 35.6550 (b) (1) through (b) (3);35.6585 (a) and (b); 35.6650; 35.6655; 35.6660; 35.6665; 35.6670; 35.6700;35.6705; 35.6710; 35.6805; 35.6810; 35.6815 (d); 35.6860; and 35.6865 ofthis rule contain collection-of-information requirements. The informationcollection requirements in this interim final rule have been approved bythe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the ``Paperwork ReductionAct,'' 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. And assigned OMB control numbers 2010-0020.An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by EPA (ICRNo. 1487) and a copy may be obtained from David Ogden, Information PolicyBranch; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (PM-223); Washington, DC 20460 or by calling(202) 475-9498.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 81 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burdento Chief, Information Policy Branch, EPA, PM-223, 401 M St., SW., Washington,DC 20460 and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Officeof Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: DeskOfficer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public commentson the information collection requirements contained in this interim finalrule.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 9, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.

In addition, the recipient must comply withthe following requirements: (a) <T3>Small purchase procedures.</T3> Small purchase procedures are thoserelatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services,supplies, or other property that do not cost more than $25,000 in the aggregate.If small purchase procurements are used, the recipient must obtain anddocument price or rate quotations from an adequate number of qualifiedsources.(b) <T3>Sealed bids (formal advertising).</T3> (For a construction award, therecipient must obtain the award official's approval to use a procurementmethod other than the sealed bid method.) Bids are publicly solicited anda fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsiblebidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditionsof the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. (1) In order for the recipient to use the sealed bid method, the followingconditions must be met:(i) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase descriptionis available; (ii) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectivelyfor the business; and (iii) The procurement lends itself to a fixed-price contract and the selectionof the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price.(2) If the recipient uses the sealed bid method, the recipient must complywith the following requirements: (i) Publicly advertise the invitation for bids and solicit bids from anadequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient time priorto the date set for opening the bids; (ii) The invitation for bids, which must include any specifications andpertinent attachments, must define the items or services in order for thebidder to properly respond; (iii) Publicly open all bids at the time and place prescribed in the invitationfor bids; (iv) Award the fixed-price contract in writing to the lowest responsiveand responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, the recipientshall consider factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and lifecycle costs in determining which bid is lowest. The recipient may onlyuse payment discounts to determine the low bid when prior experience indicatesthat such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and (v) If there is a sound documented reason, the recipient may reject anyor all bids. (c) <T3>Competitive proposals. </T3> The technique of competitive proposalsis normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer, andeither a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. Itis generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealedbids. If the recipient uses the competitive proposal method, the followingrequirements apply: (1) Recipients must publicize requests for proposals and all evaluationfactors and must identify their relative importance. The recipient musthonor any response to publicized requests for proposals to the maximumextent practical; (2) Recipients must solicit proposals from an adequate number of qualifiedsources; (3) Recipients must have a method for conducting technical evaluationsof the proposals received and for selecting awardees;(4) Recipients must award the contract to the responsible firm whose proposalis most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered;and (5) Recipients may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-basedprocurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services wherebycompetitor's qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitoris selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation.This method, where price is not used as a selection factor, may only beused in the procurement of A/E professional services. The recipient maynot use this method to purchase other types of services even though A/Efirms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort. (d) <T3>Noncompetitive proposals. </T3>(1) The recipient may procure by noncompetitiveproposals only when the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchaseprocedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals, and one of the followingcircumstances applies: (i) The item is available only from a single source; (ii) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permita delay resulting from competitive solicitation (a declaration of an emergencyunder State law does not necessarily constitute an emergency under theEPA Superfund program's criteria); (iii) The award official authorized noncompetitive proposals; or (iv) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determinedto be inadequate. (2) When using noncompetitive procurement, the recipient must conduct acost analysis in accordance with the requirements described in andSection;35.6585 of this subpart. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 35.6570</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Use of the same engineer during subsequent phases of the project.</ITAG>(a) If the public notice clearly stated the possibility that the firm orindividual selected could be awarded a contract for follow-on servicesand initial procurement complied with the procurement request of this subpart,the recipient of a CERCLA remedial response cooperative agreement may usethe engineer procured to conduct any or all of the remedial investigation(RI), the feasibility study (FS), or design to perform follow-on engineeringactivities under the remedial response without going through the publicnotice and evaluation procedures.(b) The recipient may also use the same engineer during subsequent phasesof the project in the following cases:(1) Where the recipient conducted the RI, FS, or design activities withoutEPA assistance but is using EPA funds for follow-on activities, the recipientmay use the engineer for subsequent work provided the recipient certifies:(i) That it complied with the procurement requirements in andSection; 35.6565of this subpart when it selected the engineer and the code of conduct requirementsdescribed in 40 CFR 31.36(b)(3).(ii) That any EPA-funded contract between the engineer and the recipientmeets all of the other provisions as described in the procurement requirementsin this subpart.(2) Where EPA conducted the RI, FS, or design activities but the recipientwill assume the responsibility for subsequent phases of remedial responseunder a cooperative agreement, the recipient may use, with the award official'sapproval, EPA's engineer contractor without further public notice or evaluationprovided the recipient follows the rest of the procurement requirementsof this subpart to award the contract.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 35.6575</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Restrictions on types of contracts.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Prohibited contracts. </T3>The recipient's procurement system mustnot allow cost-plus-percentage-of-cost (e.g., a multiplier which includesprofit) or percentage-of-construction-cost types of contracts.(b) <T3>Removal. </T3>Under a removal cooperative agreement, the recipientmust award a fixed price contract (lump sum, unit price, or a combinationof the two) when procuring contractor support, regardless of the procurementmethod selected, unless the recipient obtains the award official's priorwritten approval.(c) <T3>Time and material contracts. </T3>The recipient may use time and materialcontracts only if no other type of contract is suitable, and if the contractincludes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 35.6580</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contracting with minority and women's business enterprises (MBE/WBE),small businesses, and labor surplus area firms.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Procedures. </T3>The recipient must comply with the six steps describedin 40 CFR 31.36(e)(2) to ensure that MBE's, WBE's and small businessesare used whenever possible as sources of supplies, construction, and services.(b) <T3>Labor surplus firms. </T3>EPA encourages recipients to procure suppliesand services from labor surplus area firms.(c) <T3>``Fair share'' objectives. </T3>It is EPA's policy that recipientsaward a fair share of contracts to small, minority and women's businesses.The policy requires that fair share objectives for minority and woman-ownedbusiness enterprises be negotiated with the States and/or recipients, butdoes not require fair share objectives be established for small businesses.(1) Each recipient must establish an annual ``fair share'' objective forMBE and WBE use. A recipient is not required to attain a particular statisticallevel of participation by race, ethnicity, or gender of the contractor'sowners or managers.(2) If the recipient is awarded more than one cooperative agreement duringthe year, the recipient may negotiate an annual fair share for all cooperativeagreements for that year. It is not necessary to have a fair share foreach cooperative agreement. When a cooperative agreement is awarded toa recipient with which a ``fair share'' agreement has not been negotiated,the recipient must not award any contracts under the cooperative agreementuntil the recipient has negotiated a fair share objective with EPA.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 35.6585</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Cost and price analysis.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>The recipient must conduct and document a cost or priceanalysis in connection with every procurement action including contractmodification.(1) <T3>Cost analysis. </T3>The recipient must conduct and document a costanalysis for all negotiated contracts over $25,000 and for all change ordersregardless of price.

(2) <T3>Price analysis. </T3>In all instances other than those described in(a)(1) of this section, the recipient must perform a price analysis todetermine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price. (b) <T3>Profit analysis. </T3>For each contract in which there is no pricecompetition and in all cases in which cost analysis is performed, the recipientmust negotiate profit as a separate element of the price. To establisha fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to the complexityof the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor'sinvestment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record ofpast performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographicalarea for similar work. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 35.6590</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Bonding and insurance.  </ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>The recipient must meet the requirements regarding bondingdescribed in 40 CFR 31.36(h).
