The basic technical principles are summedup of the different parts of digital subtraction angiography apparatusand of methods of improving the image. The instrument is based on a videochainconsisting of an X-ray tube, an intensifier of the radiographic image,optical parts, a video camera, an analog-to-digital converter and a computer.The main advantage of the digitally processed image is the possibilityof optimizing the image into a form which will contain the biggest amountof diagnostically valuable information. Described are the mathematicaloperations for improving the digital image: spatial filtration, pixelshift, time filtration, image integration, time interval differentationand matched filtering.
