This information is collected bythe Office of Information Resources Management, from the HeadquartersStaff of NRC's Office of Inspection and Enforcement, from NRC's RegionalOffices, and from utilities. Since all of the data concerning operationof the units is provided by the utility operators less than two weeksafter the end of the month, necessary corrections to published informationare shown on the ERRATA page. This report is divided into three sections:the first contains monthly highlights and statistics for commercial operatingunits, and errata from previously reported data; the second is a compilationof detailed information on each unit, provided by NRC Regional Offices,IE Headquarters and the Utilities; and the third section is an appendixfor miscellaneous information such as spent fuel storage capability,reactor years of experience and non-power reactors in the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
