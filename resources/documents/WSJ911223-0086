In its annual ranking of the 50 largest oil companies,Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, or PIW, will report in itsissue out today that Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, isthird from the top.</LP><TEXT>   In this position, up from fifth place last year,Venezuela's aggressive government-owned company has jumpedahead of both the U.S.-based Exxon and Mexico's state-ownedPetroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex. But Saudi Arabia'sgovernment-owned company, or Saudi Aramco, and the RoyalDutch/Shell Group maintained their rankings by the oilindustry publication as the largest and the No. 2 companies.   &quot;Exxon's fall from the No. 1 to No. 4 slot over a fewyears is indicative of the difficulties encountered byprivately-owned companies in obtaining secure sources ofcrude oil following the nationalizations of oil and gasreserves&quot; by producer governments more than a decade ago, PIWreported.   PIW bases its ranking of the top 50 on the basis ofoperational data from nearly 100 firms. Its focus onoperations differs from most financially-oriented corporaterankings but allows &quot;meaningful comparisons&quot; of all types ofcompanies, the publication maintains.   The rankings are based on the most recent operating dataavailable, PIW said. Given the lag in publishing information,its latest rankings are for 1990, it added. Government-ownedKuwait Petroleum Co. dropped completely from the top 10 firmsin the PIW rankings and is now No. 14, reflecting the UnitedNations embargo imposed after the Iraqi invasion of thecountry in August 1990.   The criteria used by PIW in its rankings are oil and gasreserves, oil and gas production, refining capacity andpetroleum product sales. &quot;Financial data are not used becauseof the difficulties imposed in comparing state-owned firmswith private sector firms,&quot; PIW said.   The oil industry newsletter said several of thestate-owned firms in the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries are making significant headway in refining andmarketing endeavors even as they grow &quot;upstream&quot; in crude oilproduction. Venezuela's PDVSA is setting the pace, thepublication added.   According to PIW, the Venezuelan company added 400,000barrels a day of refining capacity in 1990 while increasingcrude production by 7.5% to more than 2.1 million barrels aday. In contrast to PDVSA's success, the reserves andproduction performance of the major international oilcompanies declined, PIW noted.   As previously reported, PDVSA has an ambitious $48 billionenergy expansion plan that includes an increase in its oilproduction capacity to 3.5 million barrels a day by 1995. Itis seeking foreign partners among the international oilcompanies for their financial and technological assistance.Several major oil companies already have signed preliminaryagreements with PDVSA that could lead to joint ventures inthe development of Venezuela's oil, including the heavyOrinoco crudes.   Mobil Corp. is the latest to link up with PDVSA. Mobilannounced Friday that it and PDVSA had signed a letter ofintent to study development and upgrading of heavy oil fromthe Orinoco belt and other exploration and productionopportunities in Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
