The African American Institute, meeting in Lusaka, sought agreater understanding of African problems in the United States,according to Randolph Nugent, the chairman of the institute's boardof trustees.   Nugent told about 175 conferees in a welcoming address that theinstitute believed U.S. administrations viewed Africa from ashort-term perspective.   ``Our aim is to help bring Americans and Africans together tohelp America take a long-term view of African problems,'' he said.   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda opened the four-day gathering byurging world nations to focus more attention on the African debtcrisis.   He cited burgeoning debt and South Afrca's policy of apartheid asthe ``root cause'' of conflict and suffering on the continent of 550million people.   Kaunda said many of the world's most heavily indebted nationswere in Africa but little was done by developed countries to offesttheir loan burden.   Between 1985 and 1987, African nations relying on exports of rawmaterials for hard currency income lost an estimated $50 billionthrough depressed commodity prices on world markets, he said.   He chided unspecified Western nations for failing to imposetougher trade sanctions against South Africa to end apartheid. SomeWestern leaders argue that sanctions would harden white SouthAfrican resistance to change and hurt blacks the most.   Among conferees from the United States and 17 African nations wasthe Rev.
