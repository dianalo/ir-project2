With the putting into operation ofthe wet flue gas desulfurisation units (REA) at the RWE power stationsabout 1,3 Mt gypsum and 750000 m/sup 3/ REA-water will be added to thisamount every year. All these power station residues are dumped in exhaustedopencast workings. Once mine dewatering is discontinued some of theseresidues will later be entrained by the ground water. Reducing the permeabilityof the ash dumps could be achieved by changing-over to compact dumpingand wet embedding of the ash by the so-called polder method. Extensivelaboratory experiments and a large-scale test have revealed that afterwet embedding and bonding of mixtures of this kind the properties ofthe dumped material that are obtained resemble those of brown coal ash.The substances contained in the desulfurisation residues are stabilisedin the dumped material. A 'stabilised-material dump' of this kind isthen additionally surrounded on all sides by a mineral sealing material.(orig./MOS).</TEXT></DOC>
