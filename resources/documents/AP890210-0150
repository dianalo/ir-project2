The tax portions of his budget plan also include canceling ascheduled reduction in taxes on airline tickets and cargo, makingpermanent the 3 percent tax on telephone service, raising SocialSecurity taxes on 2 million state and local government workers, andcutting taxes on corporations in general and the oil industry inparticular.   In a message to Congress Thursday night, the new president showedno qualms about tinkering with the landmark 1986 tax overhaul, eventhough some congressional leaders suggest any significant changecould lead to a complete unraveling.   He is likely to gain wide support for some version of a newday-care tax credit that he recommended to help 2.5 million poorerworking families. A family with at least one worker and with incomeunder $13,000 could get a tax cut of up to $1,000 a year for eachchild under age 4. The credit could even exceed the family's taxliability.   On the other hand, Bush is assured a fight over his plan to taxcapital gains _ profits from the sale of stock, real estate andother assets _ at a lower rate than applies to wages and otherincome. The change is necessary, he said, to maintain Americanleadership in the world.   ``Lower capital-gains rates will stimulate investment andeconomic growth and create additional jobs for Americans,'' Bushsaid in a written message.   Several hours earlier, the senior tax-writer in Congress, Rep.Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., had anticipated the proposal and wastedneither time nor verbiage in showing his distaste.   ``I personally will strongly resist any effort to undo (the 1986)tax reform, including the return to a preferential tax rate forcapital gains,'' Rostenkowski said. ``I'm not about to tell the wageearners in Chicago that they should pay a higher tax thanstockbrokers.''   Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,contends restoring the capital-gains break would open the door tore-enacting other deductions and exemptions that were eliminated orreduced in order to pay for across-the-board cuts in overall taxrates.   Many Democrats also have problems because the lion's share ofcapital gains are enjoyed by the nation's richest taxpayers.   More than 34 percent of the $135 billion in taxable gains thatwere reported on returns filed in 1987 were recorded by 34,818taxpayers whose incomes exceeded $1 million apiece, the InternalRevenue Service says. Their gains averaged $1.3 million.   Seventy percent of the overall gain went to 1.15 million peoplewith incomes over $100,000 each.   Bush said the cut would generate such investment activity that itwould bring the government more _ not less _ revenue. Over the nextfive years, he said, it would increase tax collections by $16billion, although it would cost the treasury $20 billion during thefollowing three years. Many economists ridicule the no-cost theory.   Capital gains and wages now are taxed the same: at rates of 15percent, 28 percent and 33 percent. Bush wants a new system thatwhen fully effective would tax most gains at a top rate of 15percent if assets were owned more than 36 months; people with lowerincomes would pay as low as 8.25 percent. Paintings and othercollectibles would not qualify.   Couples with adjusted gross incomes under $20,000 and singlepeople under $10,000 would pay no tax on any qualified capital gain.   The president apparently dumped a suggestion advanced last monthby then-President Reagan, which would have required the IRS tocharge taxpayers for telephone calls with questions about how tofile their tax returns.   Bush did ask Congress to:</TEXT><TEXT>   _Make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and long-distancetelephone service, which otherwise would expire Dec. 31, 1990. Thiswould cost taxpayers $6 billion in the following three years.   _Require 2 million state and local government workers hiredbefore April 1, 1986, to pay a tax for Medicare, which many alreadyqualify for because of a prior, non-government job or a workingspouse. The tax, collected as part of the Social Security levy, is1.45 percent of the first $48,000 of annual earnings.   _Retain the full federal taxes on airline tickets, air cargo andaviation fuel, which are due to drop by half next year.   _Permit a deduction of up to $3,000 for expenses of adopting achild with special needs, such as a physical handicap.   _Give the oil and gas industry tax credits for the first $10million of expenditures each year on such intangible oil-drillingexpenses as labor and pipe, and for spending required to usesophisticated ``tertiary'' techniques to produce oil. Rules thathinder the sale of proven oil properties to independent producerswould be repealed. Independent producers would be allowed to deductfrom the minimum tax 80 percent of certain exploratory intangibledrilling costs.   _Make permanent a 20 percent credit for increased corporatespending for research, and permit international corporations todeduct 67 percent of total research spending against domestic income.   _Give businesses $1 billion worth of tax incentives over fouryears for locating in economically distressed areas.</TEXT></DOC>
