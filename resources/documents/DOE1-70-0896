<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-70-0896 </DOCNO><TEXT>The status of the KUTI-20 collective heavy ion accelerator is presented.Three accelerating sections, three pulse shapers and 42 current pulsegenerators for shaping a guiding magnetic field, are parts of the firststage of the LUEhK-20 electron ring linear accelerator. The LUEhK-20pulse shaper circuit and design are given as well as its loading characteristic.Parameters similar to calculations are obtained as a result of the LUEhK-20preliminary adjustment. Longitudinal motion energy gain is 1.5-1.8 MeVper a section. It corresponds to 10 Kv/cm electric field intensity. Worksis currently under way on comissioning of the first stage of the KUTI-20accelerator under nitrogen ion acceleration mode. 7 refs.; 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
