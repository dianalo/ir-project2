L. 98-457, 98 Stat. 1757, 42 U.S.C. 10410.Title III (Sec. 301-303, inclusive) of this Act is entitled the ``FamilyViolence Prevention and Services Act.'' The overall purpose of Title IIIis to: demonstrate the effectiveness of assisting states in efforts toprevent family violence and to provide immediate shelter and related assistancefor victims of family violence and their dependents; and to provide technicalassistance and training in the area of family violence to states, localpublic agencies, nonprofit private organizations, and other persons seekingsuch assistance.42 U.S.C. 10410(b)(2)(A), the family violence information component, relatesspecifically to local law enforcement agencies providing various formsof information to persons who are victims of family violence, stating asfollows: (2)(A) The Secretary shall award grants or contracts to local law enforcementagencies, acting in coordination with domestic violence shelters, socialservice agencies and hospitals, for the purpose of: (i) the development of materials, to be provided to each abused familymember at the time such spouse is identified by law enforcement officers,hospital personnel, social services personnel, education counseling personnel,and other appropriate personnel involved in the identification of familyviolence cases that include:(I) an explanation in basic terms of:(aa) the rights of the abused family member under the laws of the jurisdictioninvolved; and (bb) the services available to the abused family member, including intervention,treatment, and support services; and (II) phone numbers and addresses for the services described in subparagraph(A)(ii);(ii) the development of procedures whereby domestic violence shelter, hospital,social service, or law enforcement personnel provide to an abused familymember a written report, relating to each incidence of physical abuse reportedby the family member, that includes a description of physical injuriesto the family member observed by such personnel; and (iii) the development of systems whereby domestic violence shelter or localsocial service personnel, with the consent of the abused family memberinvolved, may obtain from local law enforcement personnel information relatingto abuse of such family member, including a report describing the initialcontact of such family member and the law enforcement agency. (B) The Secretary shall provide assurances that procedures will be developedunder this paragraph to guarantee the confidentiality of the records maintained.The responsibilities for implementing the provisions of this section ofthe Act are delegated to the Attorney General under the provisions of 42U.S.C. 10410 (c).The information provisions of the Act as well as a separate section relatedto developing data on individual characteristics relating to family violenceand the objective documentation of the data on the incidence of familyviolence were companion amendments. Congress found that in many of thereported cases of family violence, the family member had been previouslyabused. However, because of the nature of family violence and the variousagencies which respond, many cases were not officially reported. Therefore,a victim who wanted to provide documentation to past abusive acts was unableto do so.The two new provisions of the Act will begin to address this shortcoming.The Department of Health and Human Services is now required to developdata on the victims of family violence and their dependents based on injuriesthat are brought to the attention of hospital, social service, or law enforcementpersonnel, whether or not formal civil or criminal action is taken. Further,in addition to requiring the collection of data, the Act now requires thatinformation concerning the availability of services and shelters be placedinto the hands of the victims as soon as possible. Often victims do notknow their rights or the location of the closest shelter.<ITAG tagnum="84">(b) Purpose</ITAG>The Office for Victims of Crime is making $40,000 available to local lawenforcement agencies for grants not to exceed $10,000 in order to improvethe information available to victims of family violence. Specifically,the funds will be used to: develop and distribute informational materialsto family violence victims; develop procedures whereby domestic violenceshelters, hospitals, social service agencies and local law enforcementagencies provide family violence victims with a written report relatedto the abuse reported by that individual; and develop a system wherebydomestic violence shelter or local social service personnel, with the consentof the victim, may obtain from the local law enforcement agency informationrelating to abuse of the victim, including a report describing the initialcontract of such family member and the law enforcement agency. <ITAG tagnum="84">(c) Eligible Applicants</ITAG>Applications will be accepted from any local enforcement agency including:town or village police departments, city police departments, county policedepartments, and sheriffs departments. The chief executive of any town,village and/or county can make application on behalf of his/her law enforcementagency if assurances are provided within the application that he/she hasthe support of the local law enforcement agency. Applications submitteddirectly from a local law enforcement agency must be submitted by the headof the agency. <ITAG tagnum="84">(d) Program Description</ITAG>The Family Violence Information Dissemination Program contains three programelements. In order to be eligible for funding consideration, each applicantmust address each of the elements. The three elements of the program are:1. Development of informational materials for family violence victims.Law enforcement agencies are requested to either develop, revise and/orreprint materials that can be used by law enforcement officers, hospitalpersonnel, social service personnel, educational counseling personnel,and other personnel involved in the identification of family violence cases.The materials should contain: information that relates to the rights ofthe victim under the law of the jurisdiction involved; the services availableto the abused family member, including intervention, treatment, and supportservices; and phone numbers and addresses for all these services.Informational materials should be developed in sufficient quantity to meetthe needs of a particular community or jurisdiction and should be relevantand appropriate to the population served. Areas serving populations whereEnglish is primarily the second language are encouraged to develop materialsthat are culturally relevant and in a form and language that is clearlycomprehended.To ensure appropriateness of material, applicants are encouraged to involvepersonnel from other agencies which respond to family violence cases. Further,the applicant must provide assurances from these other agencies of collaborativeefforts and that the materials will be utilized.2. Development of procedures whereby domestic violence shelters, hospitals,social service agencies and local law enforcement agencies provide familyviolence victims with a written report related to the abuse reported bythat individual.

Develop a system whereby domestic violence shelters or local socialservice personnel, with the consent of the victim, may obtain from thelocal law enforcement agency information relating to abuse of the victim,including a report describing the initial contact with such family membersand the law enforcement agency. One of the problems experienced by familyviolence victims is that incidence reports regarding their victimizationhave not been made available to the victim. Without this documentation,victims have often had difficulty in obtaining timely judicial relief andprotection. Applicants must describe the method for making incident reportson all family violence incidents, which they are called to investigate,available to the victim or an authorized representative of the victim.Applicants must also provide assurances that the process developed willbe utilized.<ITAG tagnum="84">(e) Selection Criteria</ITAG>In determining which applications to fund, the Office for Victims of Crimewill consider the following:A. the degree to which the applicant has addressed the three program requirements,including obtaining all applicable assurances of cooperation:1. development and production of informational materials; (20 points)2. development and implementation of procedures to ensure that family violencevictims receive a written report of each incident; (20 points)3. development and implementation of a method for making the law enforcementagency's information available to family violence victims.
