A report from the society describing the 10 said, ``Withoutprompt action, some of them may die.''   In no particular order, these are the 10 most threatened:National Key Deer in the western Florida Keys; Loxahatchee inFlorida's Everglades swamp; Stillwater near Reno, Nev.; Chincoteagueon the Virginia coast; Yazoo in Mississippi; Arctic on Alaska'sNorth Slope; Lower Rio Grande, Texas; Kesterson in California's SanJoaquin Valley; Upper Mississippi River along the Wisconsin, Iowa,Minnesota and Illinois shores of the river; and Great Swamp in NewJersey, 25 miles from Manhattan.   Kesterson is so contaminated by irrigation runoff that many ducksstopping there are killed, and most of the staff's time is spenttrying to keep waterfowl from landing. The society described therefuge as ``in a coma.''   Frampton said the 445 refuges managed by the Fish and WildlifeService have taken a back seat to the national parks, which havemajor legislation spelling out protections, a huge supportingconstituency derived from 300 million annual visitors and a historyof being carved out of the wilderness decades ago.   ``By contrast, many of our refuges are mere remnants _ designatedduring development projects as a sop to environmentalists to protectthe few remaining fragments of habitat within a much greater areadestroyed,'' Frampton said.   The society called on Congress to spell out goals and philosophyof the system, something no statute now does, to appropriate moremoney for land purchase and for the service to use more of its fundsfor protection and less for bureaucratic overhead.   Also, the service must do more to protect water quality, andshould renegotiate agreements with landowners, often other federalor state agencies, ``so that refuge managers have more control overthe quality of the habitat. ... In many cases, the best solution isprobably to transfer title to the Fish and Wildlife Service.''   ``All of these threats are man-caused,'' Frampton said. ``Almostall of them could be mitigated or controlled by intelligentmanagement.''   Frank Dunkle, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, said ina statement: ``The situations cited by the Wilderness Society arenot new, nor are they being ignored. The society seems to think wecan build a moat around each of our 445 refuges to protect them frompollution and other external threats. Unfortunately, that just isnot possible.   ``I wish, however, the society had given us and the Congress morecredit for what we are doing to combat the problems identified inthe report.''   The society said these refuges didn't make the top 10 but hadserious problems anyway: Fallon, Nevada; Bowdoin, Montana; HakalauForest, Hawaii; Upper Souris and J. Clark Salyer, North Dakota;Ouray, Wyoming; Kenai, Alaska; and Tule Lake, California.</TEXT></DOC>
