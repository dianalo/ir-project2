White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT GM GME </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   H. Ross Perot's controversial no-bid contract to streamline the U.S. Postal Service was suspended by an arm of the General Services Administration, and the U.S. Postmaster General conceded that the agreement must be changed to appease congressional critics.    The General Services Administration's Board of Contract Appeals ordered the suspension of the Perot Systems Corp. agreement late yesterday. The suspension was prompted by a protest of the pact brought by Electronic Data Systems Corp., Mr. Perot's former company, and by another computer-services concern.    The developments sparked an immediate and angry reaction from the Texas billionaire, who said in a telephone interview late yesterday that he now intends to compete directly with EDS for commercial contracts. Perot Systems has only a couple of dozen employees while EDS has 48,000, but Mr. Perot said yesterday that he has job applications from 6,000 people, and plenty of potential business to seek.    &quot;So far we've just stood there like a featherbed and let them kick us around,&quot; Mr. Perot said. &quot;We're going straight into the heart of the commercial market now.&quot;    Mr. Perot is prohibited from launching a profit-making venture before December 1989 under terms of a non-compete agreement with General Motors Corp., to which he sold EDS in 1984. In December 1986, he left EDS and GM's board under terms of a $750 million buy-out agreement after clashes with GM Chairman Roger B. Smith. He now blames GM for orchestrating opposition to his new company's contract with the Postal Service.    Mr. Perot yesterday laughed off any suggestion that the non-compete agreement will be a problem. &quot;I have to work nonprofit for customers EDS is making a profit on,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;You're going to see warfare in the streets.&quot;    Still, the immediate impact of the GSA board decision could be that the Postal Service cannot pay Perot Systems for further work. The Postal Service, however, already has asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to declare that the GSA contracts board has no jurisdiction over the service. That appeal is pending.    Postmaster General Anthony Frank said in an interview yesterday just prior to the GSA board ruling that the Postal Service &quot;will have to modify phase two&quot; of the contract &quot;so it's acceptable to Congress.&quot;    Mr. Perot said he hadn't talked to Mr. Frank about changing the Postal Service contract.    Under phase two of that agreement, Perot Systems was to implement cost savings over a 10-year period, and make a profit after December 1989 by sharing in those savings. The first phase of the contract was a $500,000, 90-day study of the Postal Service's operations that began last month.    The unusual terms of the pact had drawn fire from Capitol Hill. Sens. Paul Simon (D., Ill.), Carl Levin (D., Mich.) and others have charged the contract could result in huge profits for Perot Systems at the expense of postal patrons.    Mr. Frank, who spoke before the GSA board action yesterday, conceded that he had underestimated the trouble awarding an unusually structured, no-bid contract would cause, particularly at a time when allegations of contracting fraud at the Pentagon have whipped up a firestorm in Washington. But Mr. Frank blamed some of his problems on anti-Perot lobbying by EDS and GM.    &quot;We've got a $500,000 contract here that's caught in a Roger Smith and Ross Perot cross fire,&quot; Mr. Frank said. &quot;And if we back down, the score is GM one, American people nothing.&quot;    A GM spokesman said yesterday that the Perot contract is &quot;an EDS matter&quot; and that Mr. Smith wasn't involved. An EDS spokeswoman said &quot;anything that threatens EDS's interests we lobby against&quot; and added that the GSA board decision was &quot;not the result of lobbying, it was the result of excellent legal work.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
