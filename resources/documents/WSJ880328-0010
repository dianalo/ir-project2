That is the unanimous view of 16 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. &quot;The Fed will stand pat,&quot; predicts Robert G. Dederick, executive vice president at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. &quot;I find it hard to believe the Fed could tighten now in view of all the problems in the banking system and an absence of actual inflation.&quot;    As the adjoining chart shows, most also agree that the economy continued to expand during the first quarter and will grow at a moderate clip during the next three months. Only two -- Irwin L. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and H. Erich Heinemann of Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co. -- argue that a recession has begun.    But there is widespread disagreement over how rapidly the economy is growing and how much of a threat inflation will represent.    While the bond market rallied Friday, other financial markets were depressed by economic worries. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.92 points to 1978.95 as investors, still shaken by Thursday's nearly 44-point fall, continued to move their funds from stocks into bonds.    For the week, stocks were off 108 points, driven down by jitters over a sharply lower dollar and renewed worries about inflation, interest rates and the trade deficit. The market continues to digest recession fears, too.    On the dollar front, traders this week face another showdown with the Federal Reserve after watching the greenback sink last week to its lowest levels since Jan. 5. On Friday, the Fed intervened to buy dollars -- making its most visible appearance since early January. In Tokyo trading early Monday, the dollar continued to fall to 124.65 yen, up from a low of 124.37 yen, but down from 125.05 yen in late New York trading Friday. The Bank of Japan reportedly was intervening.    Some analysts insist that investor fears about inflation are wildly exaggerated. &quot;The latest anxieties about the economy overheating are about as overblown as last month's worries about a recession,&quot; says Alan Reynolds of Polyconomics Inc. He predicts that yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, now about 8 5/8%, will drop to 7.9% by midyear.    Edward S. Hyman, vice chairman of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., contends that investors aren't paying enough attention to strains in the banking system, especially the massive woes of First RepublicBank in Dallas. The fragility of the banking system &quot;will prevent the Fed from tightening,&quot; he says. &quot;Also, I think the economy is going to be slowing and inflation is going to stay low,&quot; leading to lower interest rates. He expects the yield on 30-year government bonds to drop to 8% by June 30.    Others, though, fear inflation pressures will intensify soon. Several analysts predict the Fed committee, while leaving policy unchanged for the moment, also will authorize a slight credit-tightening move to be implemented if commodity prices surge, the dollar slumps and the economy accelerates.    Bond traders say the most important government statistics to be released this week will come from the Labor Department, which will release its March employment report Friday morning. The employment report often contains major surprises that rattle all the financial markets. Also, the National Association of Purchasing Management will release next Monday its March survey of industrial purchasing managers.    &quot;The economy really is showing impressive growth,&quot; says Jay N. Woodworth of Bankers Trust Co. He predicts that interest rates will surge over the next few months and that inflation will accelerate during the second half of the year. For example, he expects 30-year Treasury bond yields to increase by about one percentage point to 9 1/4% by midyear.    Mr. Woodworth estimates the economy grew at an inflation-adjusted pace of 1% this quarter and will grow at a 2.5% pace next quarter. But these figures understate the economy's true strength, he says. He argues that a more important measure, inflation-adjusted final sales, is expanding at a much stronger pace and that companies have been able to reduce the large inventories they amassed during last year's fourth quarter.    Once again, David Levine of Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. is the most optimistic about the economy's growth prospects, as he has been for more than two years. Although he has been far from the mark during that period, he says evidence is mounting in support of his forecast of an economic boom. He also predicts sharply higher interest rates, with 30-year Treasury bond yields surging to 9.65% by midyear and to between 11% and 11 1/4% by year end.    Nonsense, replies Mr. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover. He contends that a recession began in January or possibly even last December and that interest rates will drift slightly lower during the next few months. Mr. Heinemann of Ladenburg Thalmann, the other economist who believes a recession has begun, says the Fed should stop paying so much attention to trying to stabilize the dollar in the foreign-exchange markets. &quot;I cannot see the Fed crucifying the American economy on somebody's arbitrary idea of where the dollar belongs,&quot; he says.    Lawrence Kudlow of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., disagrees with the notion that the economy has entered a recession. But he equally disagrees with the idea that inflation pressures will surge. &quot;All this talk about the economy overheating and higher inflation is completely misplaced,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a snare and a delusion.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Bond prices rallied as the stock market was slumping. Traders say the stock market's weakness on both Thursday and Friday heightened fears about a potential replay of last October's crash, which prompted many investors to switch funds out of stocks into government-backed bonds.    Some actively traded Treasury bonds advanced by about five-eighths of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the most actively traded 30-year government bonds declined to 8.67% from 8.73% Thursday.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 7.44 points to 1282.73. That left it just below its level of 1284.01 one week earlier. The index's high last Friday was 1284.06 and the low was 1275.89.    Many investors already are rushing to buy short-term Treasury bills, which are widely considered the safest and stodgiest of all investments. This development has produced sharp declines in rates on these bills.    For example, the rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills fell to 5.59% bid Friday from 5.8% Thursday. The rate on the latest six-month bills declined to 5.9% bid from 6.03%, while the latest one-year bill rate fell to 6.26% bid from 6.4%.    The Treasury sold about $4.06 billion of 22-day cash-management bills at an average rate of 6.20%. Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                                             2-Day    Applications                       $38,809,000,000    Accepted bids                       $4,055,000,000    Accepted at low price                          22%    Accepted noncompetitively                        0    Average price (Rate)                 99.621(6.20%)    High price (Rate)                    99.622(6.18%)    Low price (Rate)                     99.620(6.22%)    Coupon equivalent                            6.31%   The bills are dated March 30 and will mature April 21, 1988.   ---                      Economic Forecasts                    GNP Growth, in percent                                           1988        1988                                          FIRST      SECOND                                        QUARTER     QUARTER    David A.
