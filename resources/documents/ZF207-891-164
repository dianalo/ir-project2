 Although this fact is understandable (dealers are simply toolocalized and too numerous to adequately cover), it's also unfortunate.andO;Often, where you buy a product can be more important than what you buy.andM;The range of prices and service levels available in today's PC market istruly extraordinary.andP;  On the one hand, you can literally buy your productsoff the back of a lorry at steep discounts and without a prayer for support.andO;On the other, you can purchase your kit from a full service operation thatwill do the installation and hold your hand -- all at well above list price.andM;Buyers typically see their choices in the PC retail market as a straight-linetrade-off between price and service.andP;  In reality, though, the choice isn'tquite so simple.andP;  High prices don't always mean good service and vice versa.andO;The art of effective PC purchasing is to find vendors that offer price andservice above the norm.andP;  The goal is not merely to find your place on theprice/service line; the idea is to put yourself well above it.andM;Many of today's major 'full service' vendors, those that claim to givepremium service at reduced discounts, don't give particularly good value.andO;Often, sales people from these stores try to impress prospective buyers withglossy literature, impressive storefronts and promises of comprehensivetechnical support.andP;  But the reality often falls short of this.andM;Glossy literature and impressive storefronts shouldn't be ignored -- they doimply a level of professionalism and organization.andP;  But they may tell youmore about the professionalism and organization of the firm's graphic artistsand store designers (who probably aren't even in-house staff) than they tellyou about the quality of service and support you can expect.andM;A large technical support staff may also be of no particular help if thepeople on that staff don't know what they're talking about.andP;  Many dealers paytechnicians very low salaries -- often one third less than corporate PCsupport analysts.andP;  As a result, the quality of these staff is often quitepoor.andM;On the other hand, smaller dealers can often provide surprisingly goodservice and support.andP;  Such dealerships are less specialized, so sales peopleare often quite knowledgeable about their products.andP;  The back office may havea technical wizard who can provide quick solutions to your support problems.andO;Deliveries and returns may also be faster -- because your firm represents alarger share of the dealer's revenue, he'll be proportionately more concernedabout keeping your business, and because their names aren't household words,small dealers can provide better discounts.andM;Although small dealerships often provide good value, they offer some risks aswell.andP;  The departure of one or two staff can cause radical decline in thequality of service and support.andP;  As their sales increase, small vendors oftenfail to increase their sales and support staff at the same rate.andO;Consequently, existing staff become overworked and service deteriorates.andO;Smaller dealers also face occasional cash shortages, which can lead to poorrelations with their suppliers, hence poor service for their customers.andM;Unfortunately, when it comes to purchasing PCs and peripherals, the rule is,let the buyer beware.andP;  There are no substitutes for a careful screeningprocess, which includes questioning sales and support staff to make sure theyknow their business, getting references and making small initial orders totest dealers out.andM;Generally, one good dealer is not enough to properly meet a largecorporation's PC requirements.andP;  Many companies use software specialty dealersto get the extra measure of software support they offer.andP;  Others may buyroutine hardware configurations from a dealer who offers good pricing anddelivery times, while they buy LANs and other atypical products from dealersthat are stronger on the technical side.andP;  Having multiple dealers alsoprovides an element of backup -- if one vendor can't deliver some urgentlyneeded item by a particular date, perhaps another can.andM;Once you have selected a group of dealers, you must keep them from becomingcomplacent.andP;  Make it clear that you're always considering alternatives, andthat poor service and high prices will not be tolerated.andP;  On larger orders,the use of bid packages can keep complacent dealers competitive.andP;  Thus, it'snot only a question of what and where you buy, but how you buy as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
