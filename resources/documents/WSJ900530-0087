Now, there's a yuppieparent's dream: law camp.   At National LawCamp, opening this summer in Miami Shores,Fla., teen campers will be introduced to the basics of thebar, from how to file a lawsuit to how to try a case. Withproper coaching, they may be able to decide once and for allwhether law is the right profession for them -- and perhapseven choose their legal specialty, a distinct advantage forany high school sophomore or junior.</LP><TEXT>   The three-week July session will offer daylong seminars onsuch substantive subjects as the Fourth and Fifth amendmentsand the law of torts. There will be field trips to a nearbycourthouse, hikes to a crime lab and, for starry nightsaround the campfire, lectures on legal ethics.   Visiting lecturers will include criminal defense lawyersand state and federal judges. Staffers from Stanley H. KaplanEducational Center Ltd., the test-review company, will handout treats: samples of the Law School Admissions Test.   The idea, says camp founder Chris Salamone, a FortLauderdale lawyer, is to give young people &quot;an idea at anearly age about whether they really are interested&quot; in thelaw. He hopes also to counter what he calls the glamorizationof law through television. &quot;It's not all fast cars andprizes,&quot; he says.   Mr. Salamone, whose father runs sports camps nationwide,hopes to teach the young campers how to think like lawyers.&quot;In law school, there are no answers, only questions,arguments and analysis,&quot; he says. &quot;We want to start themthinking in this new way.&quot;   So far, 27 teens have signed up, for $1,995 each. Theirparents -- and perhaps the campers themselves -- have beenattracted by such pitches as this from the most recent issueof Washingtonian magazine: &quot;While other kids are practicingtennis this summer, yours can be practicing law.&quot;   Kelly Warrick, a high school junior from Stamford, Conn.,says she spent her camp days last summer at Amherst College,taking a course called &quot;Comparative Satire in British andAmerican Literature.&quot;   This summer, she'll switch to law camp because, she says,she's &quot;interested in the challenge of proving things. Also,I'm trying to explore my options careerwise now.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
