In Notice 87-11, RSPA and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)proposed to (1) permit the use of railroad tank car tanks with tank shellthicknesses in localized areas less than the minimum specified in the HazardousMaterials Regulations (HMR) and (2) require the measurement of tank cartank thicknesses under certain conditions. These actions were based uponthe belief of RSPA and FRA that small localized reductions in shell thicknessdue to tank repairs would not significantly reduce the safety level oftank car tanks and upon the observation of FRA that some repair facilitieswere not recording tank car tank thickness measurements on repair records.The interested reader is directed to Notice No. 87-11 for additional backgroundinformation concerning this rulemaking.In response to the NPRM, RSPA received 17 comments concerning the reductionsin shell thickness and one comment concerning the tank car tank measurementissue. Several commenters suggested that there is not or should not beany requirement for minimum tank car shell thicknesses after a tank carhas been built. These commenters further suggested that the periodic hydrostatictests should be sufficient to ensure the continued safety of the afffectedtank car tanks. RSPA and FRA disagree with this position. RSPA's and FRA'sposition is that, under the current HMR, if for any reason a package, includinga tank car tank, does not meet the applicable specification under whichit was constructed, the specification markings on the package must be removedor rendered illegible thereby removing its certification as a specificationpackage. This docket would modify that general rule for certain specialsituations.All commenters who responded to the thin shell issue supported the conceptthat tank car tanks which have small localized reductions of shell thicknessdue to tank repairs should be allowed to continue in service. However,the Association of American Railroads (AAR) had four reservations on thespecific proposals in Notice No. 87-11. The AAR comments were endorsedby seven other commenters.The AAR proposed to limit the use of thin shell tank car tanks to so called``pressure tank car tanks'' and to class DOT 111 tank car tanks. The AARnoted that some class DOT 103 tank car tanks have a minimum shell thicknessof as low as \5/16\ inches. RSPA and FRA agree that allowing \1/16\ inchreductions in shell thickness on some ``non-pressure'' tank car tanks couldpose an unacceptable risk. Therefore, RSPA is limiting the scope of thisrulemaking to classes DOT 105, 109, 111, 112, and 114 tank car tanks.The AAR also proposed to limit the use of thin shell tank car tanks totanks constructed of carbon steel. The AAR did not elaborate on their reasonsfor this limitation. However, the research report discussed in Notice No.87-011 was limited to an analysis of carbon steel tank car tanks. Therefore,RSPA is limiting the scope of this rulemaking to carbon steel tanks.The AAR also proposed to limit the use of thin shell tank car tanks tothose tanks which are attached to car structures which conform with section6.2 (Design Loads and Stresses) of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars.The AAR did not elaborate on their reasons for this limitation. However,RSPA and FRA believe that there might be an unacceptable reduction in safetyif thin shell tank car tanks were permitted to be used in combination witholder car structures that do not conform with 6.2 of the AAR Specificationsfor Tank Cars. Therefore, RSPA is limiting the scope of this rulemakingto tank car tanks that are attached to car structures conforming with section6.2.The AAR further posposed to limit localized reductions in shell thicknessareas to no more than 2 feet in perimeter. It is not clear whether theAAR intended that the 2 foot perimeter restriction apply for each reductionin shell thickness or was a cumulative requirement for all reductions inshell thickness on a tank car tank. The AAR did not elaborate on its reasonsfor proposing a more stringent limitation on the allowable reductions inshell thickness areas, but RSPA and FRA believe that, for a reduction inshell thickness with an irregular shape, it will be considerably easierto determine the perimeter of a reduction in shell thickness than the areaof a reduction in shell thickness. Furthermore, the use of a perimeter-basedreduction in shell thickness criteria could preclude certain potentiallyunsafe reduction in shell thicknesses. For example, the area limitationin Notice No. 87-11 would allow a reduction in shell thickness, 60 feetin length and \3/8\ inches in width, whereas the AAR area limitation wouldnot allow such an extreme situation. However, RSPA and FRA believe thatthe AAR proposal to limit the maximum reduction in shell thickness perimeterto 2 feet is unduly restrictive. Therefore, RSPA is amending andSection;173.31(a)(11)(i) to require that the total cumulative surface perimeterof the reduction in shell thickness on each tank car tank does not exceedsix feet. For reductions in shell thickness that are square or cylindrical,there is little difference between the provisions contained in proposedandSection;andSection; 173.31(a)(11) (ii), and 173.31(a)(11) (ii) as adoptedin this final rule, but the AAR proposal is considerably more restrictivethan either version. For example, for a tank with a single reduction inshell thickness, the AAR proposal would allow a square reduction in shellthickness with sides of no more than 0.5 feet or a circular reduction inshell thickness with a diameter of no more than 0.6 feet; Notice No. 87-11would allow a square reduction in shell thickness with sides of no morethan 1.4 feet or a circular reduction in shell thickness to have a diameterof no more than 2.5 feet; and this final rule allows a square reductionin shell thickness with sides of no more than 1.5 feet or a circular reductionin shell thickness with a diameter of no more than 1.9 feet. However, forlong, narrow reductions in shell thickness this final rule is considerablymore restrictive than Notice No. 87-11 but is less restrictive than theAAR proposal. For example, for a tank with a single reduction in shellthickness, the AAR proposal would allow a long narrow reduction in shellthickness with a length of no more than one foot; Notice No. 87-11 wouldallow a long narrow reduction in shell thickness extending the entire lengthof the tank car tank; and this final rule allows a long narrow reductionin shell thickness to have a length of no more than three feet.All commenters who responded to the thin shell issue suggested that therelief proposed in Notice 87-11 should be broadened to additional situations,such as (1) reductions in shell thickness resulting from causes other thanrepair operations, such as corrosion; (2) reductions in shell thicknesson ethylene oxide tank car tanks; (3) reductions in shell thickness onthe lower half of any tank car tank head; (4) reductions in shell thicknessgreater than \1/16\ inches in depth; (5) reductions in shell thicknesswith a total cumulative surface area in excess of two square feet; and(6) reductions in shell thickness on cargo tanks. RSPA and FRA believethat additional relief may be justified in some or all of the above situations,as well as for tanks constructed of materials other than carbon steel,for classes DOT 103, 104, and 115 tanks, for AAR specification tank cartanks, and for tank car tanks that are attached to car structures conformingwith section 6.2 of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars. However, RSPAand FRA believe that there was insufficient information presented in thecomments to justify additional relief at this time, and some of the issuesraised are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. The AAR noted that it issponsoring two studies on the thin shell issue. When the results of thosestudies are available, RSPA and FRA will consider the results and evaluatethat information, and information from other sources to determine the needfor future rulemaking. One commenter, who responded to the proposed requirement for the measurementand recording of tank car tank thickness after certain repairs, disagreedwith the assertion in Notice 87-11 that these measurements and recordingof measurements are already implicitly required by the HMR. However, nosubstantive arguments were advanced by this commenter to support this position.RSPA and FRA believe that performing these measurements is essential toensure that tank car tank repairs result in the ``reconstruction of a tankto its original design'' and are required under the current HMR. The onlypurpose of the proposed change to andSection; 173.31(f) was for clarity.However, upon review, RSPA and FRA have determined that there is no needto record these measurements because the tank shell (before and after therepair) must be within the established limits set forth in part 179, andthe amendments to this rulemaking for localized thin spots. Therefore,by not requiring that these measurements be recorded, RSPA and FRA willreduce the information collection burden previously imposed on the repairfacilities. Lastly, in this final rule RSPA is amending andSection; 173.31(f)to require that tank shell thickness measurements be performed only whenthere is a possible <T3>reduction </T3>in the tank thickness. Several commenters pointed outa typographical error in proposed andSection; 173.31(a)(11)(v) which prohibitedthe use of any tank car tank with scores, gouges, or other areas of stressconcentration. In the final rule that paragraph is amended to require that<T3>no reduction in shell thickness </T3>may have any scores, gouges, orother areas of stress concentration. In andSection; 173.31, RSPA is revising paragraph (a)(11) to clarify thatallowing the use of tank car tanks with localized reductions in shell thicknessalso applies to tank car tanks made and maintained to the specificationsof the Canadian Transport Commission and used to transport hazardous materialswithin the United States. Paragraph (f) is revised to clarify that therequirements contained in andSection; 173.31 also apply to tank car tankconversions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Notices </ITAG>The RSPA has determined that this rulemaking (1) is not ``major'' underExecutive Order 12291; (2) is not ``significant'' under DOT's regulatorypolicies and procedures (44 FR 11034); (3) will not affect not-for-profitenterprises or small governmental jurisdictions; and (4) does not requirean environmental impact statement under the National Environmental PolicyAct (40 U.S.C. <T3>et seq.</T3>) A regulatory evaluation is available for review in theDocket. Based on limited information concerning the size and nature of entitieslikely to be affected by this final rule, I certify that this regulationwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Ihave reviewed this regulation in accordance with Executive Order 12612(``Federalism''). It has no substantial direct effects on States, on theFederal-State relationship or on the distribution of power and responsibilitiesamong levels of government. Thus, this regulation contains no policiesthat have Federalism implications as defined in Executive Order 12612 and,therefore, no Federalism Assessment has been prepared. A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Regulatory Agenda of Federal Regulations. The RegulatoryInformation Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and Octoberof each year. The RIN number contained in the heading of this documentcan be used to cross reference this action with the Unified RegulatoryAgenda. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 173 </ITAG>Hazardous materials transportation, Packaging and containers.
