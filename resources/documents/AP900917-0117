We're looking forprofessional respect,'' said sixth-grade teacher Katy Hall, one ofa half-dozen teachers picketing Lafayette Elementary School beforedawn. ``I think the public looks upon us only as professional babysitters.''   ``Maybe one in 10 toilets work. There's no toilet paper. Noteaching supplies. No ditto paper. There's always a shortage oftextbooks,'' said Joseph ``Wally'' Johnson, who teaches computerscience at Lafayette.   Frank Fudesco, the board's chief negotiator, denied that therewas any shortage of toilet tissue.   Union and school board officials said they did not know how manyof the 84,000 students were in class or how many of the 5,000teachers crossed picket lines. Principals who were called for spotchecks said 75 to 90 percent of their students were in.   Parents of some emotionally disturbed or educationally disabledchildren were told that classes for their children were canceled.Otherwise, the school board said classes would continue as usual.   No contract talks were scheduled.   Also starting strikes Monday were two districts in Pennsylvania:Cumberland Valley in Cumberland County, with 6,457 students at 10schools and 425 teachers, and Penn-Delco in Delaware County, with3,000 students at six schools and 187 teachers.   New Orleans union president Nat Lacour said the Orleans ParishSchool Board's refusal to pay $400,000 in health insurance premiumstriggered the strike.   The teachers scaled back their request over the weekend to $1million in additional health benefits. The school board turned themdown and stuck to the $600,000 it had offered.   ``We cannot give what we do not have,'' said Fudesco.   Sharon Delahoussaye, picket captain at Lusher Elementary, saidpremiums went up from $500 to $800 a person this year. The unionwants the board to cover half the $300 difference, she said.   ``The board's first proposal was for $50 a person. The secondwas for $100. We're asking $150 a person,'' said Delahoussaye.   Lacour reinstated demands, dropped during earlier bargaining,for a $45 million package that includes 10 percent annual payraises for the teachers plus 1,100 teachers' aides and schoolsecretaries.   Louisiana teachers get much of their pay from the state, whichincreased its share 7 percent this year. The state now pays $14,472for a starting teacher with a bachelors degree and $25,737 forsomeone with a doctorate and 25 years experience, said W.J.Cleveland, of the fiscal office for the state Education Department.   Some poor rural poarishes don't add anything to that. Clevelandestimated that the average parish supplement is $3,500.   New Orleans adds $4,983 to a starting salary and $9,374 at thetop of the scale, so that starting teachers get $19,455 and someoneat top gets $35,111.   The city is offering no raise.   The board has raised teachers' salaries twice since 1983, butLacour said the increases have been eroded by rising healthinsurance and retirement costs.</TEXT></DOC>
