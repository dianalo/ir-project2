RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today left intact a NorthDakota law that requires parents who teach their children at home tobe certified by the state.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by parents whosaid the law violates their right to practice their religion freely.   The North Dakota law was challenged by Lawrence and DeborahAnderson of Jamestown and Mark and Lynette Dagley of Mandan.   The couples said they believe that God has given themresponsibility for their children, including their education, andthat sending them to school away from home would violate theirreligious convictions.   The Andersons were fined $1,000 and the Dagleys $500 forviolating the state's compulsory school attendance law.   North Dakota requires school attendance for children 7 to 16. Thelaw also requires that religious schools be approved by the stateand that such schools employ teachers who are certified by the state.   The law permits parents who are certified as teachers to conductschools at home for their children.   The North Dakota Supreme Court upheld the statute last June. Itsaid North Dakota's ``compelling interest in the education ofchildren'' permits some restriction on the free exercise of religion.   The only question is ``whether or not the state has chosen theleast restrictive alternative to achieve its compelling interest,''the state court said.   It said North Dakota could choose another system, such asauthorizing visits to homes by state officials and monitoring thechildren's educational process.   But the state court said those alternatives might mean a moreintrusive role for the state in supervising the religious trainingof children taught at home.   The Andersons and Dagleys said North Dakota is the only state inthe nation that requires parents who teach their children at home tobe state-certified.   ``Scientific and educational evidence points unanimously to thesame conclusion _ home-schooled children taught by uncertifiedparents are receiving an excellent education,'' they said.   The parents said a less-restrictive alternative for the statewould be to require parents to disclose at the outset that they areteaching their children at home and then require the children totake periodic tests given by public school officials.   The case is Anderson vs. North Dakota, 88-350.</TEXT></DOC>
