Christenson,assistant administrator of the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment.   Christenson did not indicate whether some other way would befound to pay for food purchases. He did say, however, that AID hasdecided to make grants rather than loans in the future for long-termdevelopment projects.   Christenson testified Thursday before a hearing by the HouseSelect Committee on Hunger on whether the distribution of U.S. foodas aid should be restructured.   Grants generally were used rather than loans when the MarshallPlan and other aid programs began under President Harry Truman morethan 40 years ago, though Christenson did not go that far back inhis account.   He said that 35 years ago loans to Third World countries wereconsidered highly secure, while today many countries have debtburdens that are holding down their living standards.   ``We are asking ourselves whether it makes sense to increase thedebt burden of these already over-extended countries in order tofinance the importation of a consumable,'' Christenson said.   The Bush administration also wants to explore whether the loansincrease the role of government agencies in the borrowing countriesat a time when U.S. policy is to promote private business, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
