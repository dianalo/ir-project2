Michael S. Dukakis' presidentialcampaign than the woman who would fill his Statehouse office if hecaptures the White House.   But Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, the first woman ever to hold aconstitutional office in Massachusetts, is neither overwhelmed bythe prospect of occupying the governor's seat nor pressing for thatpower.   Murphy, 47, spent ``eight years, day and night, seven days aweek, 16 hours a day'' to get where she is today, she said in aninterview last week. ``By anybody's measure, it was a long time toget elected.''   But for Murphy, an economist with a Ph.D. from Duke University,it was an investment made not so much as a stepping stone to thegovernor's office one floor above her own.   ``I looked at it as a place in which I could show people what Icould do,'' she said.   Murphy finds herself at a moment that may be unique in thehistory of the ill-defined No. 2 seat of authority inMassachusetts' state government.   When she campaigned for the job in 1986, she had to pitch a needfor the post as much as her ability to fill it. John Kerry, who haddefeated her in her first bid for the job in 1982, abandoned theoffice after being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984. For the nexttwo years the office was vacant, without much concern to anyone.   Then, shortly after she won the lieutenant governorship in 1986on a platform of turning the office into a long-range planning armof state government, Dukakis launched his White House bid. Threemonths into her term, Murphy found her job had taken on newimportance.   ``When we started out, I wasn't quite clear what an actinggovernor does when the governor sets out to be president,'' Murphysaid. Her role has slowly expanded as Dukakis spends more time onthe campaign trail.   But during her first year, Murphy had her own agenda to keep.She had her Blueprint 2000 project, a two-year series of regionalhearings, statistical analysis and predictions aimed at assessingthe commonwealth's needs into the 21st century and developing``some very basic, simple, fundamental directions'' for the decadeahead.   Then there was there requests from groups across the statewanting to get a look at the first female lieutenant governor.   There were 1,000 requests in the first six months alone, shesaid, ``and you feel an obligation to go out and speak becausepeople want to see what this `thing' is all about.''   Murphy's role as Dukakis' surrogate has been eased by the``philosophic agreement'' they achieved working together off and onover a dozen years, first as his environmental affairs secretaryand later as his economic affairs secretary.   Murphy compared her development as lieutenant governor toDukakis' as a presidential candidate.   ``Michael and I both have the same kind of attitude towards howyou step into uncharted waters _ step by step, learn from each movewhat else can be taken over.''</TEXT></DOC>
