The channels of irregular configuraton unlike the channelsof periodic lattices, which are called standard, are considered as non-standard.The analytical representation of geometric characteristics of the cellsbeing a part of the non-standard channels is obtained for such channels.The surfaces widely met in practice: cylindrical, multiangular and mixed(having direct sections and sections with a designed curvature radius)ones are considered. 2 refs.; 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
