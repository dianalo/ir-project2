Schlesinger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> C LABOR </CO><IN> AUT TNM </IN><TEXT>   Chrysler Corp., responding to intense union pressure, said it scrapped its attempt to sell its parts subsidiary.    The auto maker did say, however, that over the next 18 months it would either sell or close four of the plants in the Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary, affecting 2,000 workers.    In addition, Chrysler, based in Highland, Mich., made the unusual move of asking the United Auto Workers union to open national contract negotiations &quot;promptly.&quot; The current three-year pact doesn't expire until Sept. 14, and negotiations traditionally wouldn't start until July.    Concerned about losing a large portion of its Chrysler membership through the sale, the UAW last week in protest froze various joint union-management programs throughout Chrysler. The protest included an angry demonstration last week in front of Chrysler's headquarters. The union also has threatened the manufacturer with a series of crippling local strikes, ostensibly over health and safety grievances but in reality over the possible sale.    &quot;The feelings of our employees played a key role in the decision&quot; to put off the sale, a Chrysler spokesman said. &quot;We underestimated, initially, how strongly they felt.&quot;    The Acustar action marks the second time this year that Chrysler has caved in to sharp union and public reaction to a controversial decision. After sharp protests following its January announcement that it will close its Kenosha, Wis., assembly plant, the auto maker agreed to set up a special fund worth up to $20 million for laid-off auto workers. One Chrysler official, concerned about the pattern, complained, &quot;this is Munich, it's peace in our time.&quot;    The UAW, in a prepared statement, said, &quot;We certainly welcome this announcement, since we have maintained all along that Chrysler is a stronger company with its own internal parts-making capacity.&quot;    The union added, however, that it &quot;continues to be greatly concerned by the mention of closings.&quot; But one union official said the Acustar plants targeted for sale or shutdown -- the Amplex Van Wert, Trenton Chemical, Detroit Forge, and Detroit Trim plants -- had long been discussed as doomed and weren't a surprise to the union.    Acustar includes 20 of the 44 U.S. Chrysler plants represented by the UAW, and employs about 11,000 of the UAW's roughly 60,000 Chrysler members.    Chrysler's offer to open the national contract negotiations early had no link to the Acustar announcement, the company spokesman said. &quot;If you start earlier, the talks will be less adversarial and you will have more time to get issues resolved,&quot; he added.    The UAW, for its part, said &quot;it is not appropriate&quot; to respond now to that offer. &quot;This is a proposition that must be taken up with the national Chrysler council, and will be presented to that forum in due course.&quot;    Whenever those national talks start, Chrysler will have to mend many fences at the plant level beforehand. Nearly every local union either voted to strike or planned to since the Acustar issue flared up, and while most of those possible walkouts will likely never take place, about three plants are still seriously pursuing grievances, a union official said.    Negotiations over various grievances continued intensely at Chrysler's Sterling Heights, Mich., stamping operations. A strike there, which could happen as soon as next week, would nearly shut down the corporation as most assembly plants rely on its work.    The UAW did indicate in its prepared statement that it will again encourage cooperation in joint union-management programs. &quot;We recognize that good overall relations with an employer must form the basis of successful joint activities and we are happy to see that Chrysler is desirous of restoring those good relations,&quot; the union said.    Chrysler created its Acustar subsidiary for its parts plants last year. It confirmed in January that it was negotiating to sell the unit, and at least two companies were reportedly interested. The Chrysler spokesman said, &quot;We did feel strongly if (Acustar was) totally independent,&quot; the operation &quot;could become more competitive.&quot; But he added that &quot;it's still a viable force.&quot;    Parts plants have been a source of contention at each of the Big Three auto makers, who say that union wages make those operations uncompetitive with independent producers. GM, in contract negotiations last year, unsuccessfully tried to convince parts workers to take a lower wage than assembly workers. Chrysler may try to pursue the same option in this year's talks. </TEXT></DOC>
