Jack Sherman, the Marine Corps executive, was served with awritten notice advising him of the government's decision ``toterminate (his) federal employment,'' the service said in a briefstatement.   ``Federal personnel regulations require that employees proposedfor removal based on a criminal conviction or guilty plea beprovided written notice and at least seven days in which to commentbefore final action is taken.''   The 52-year-old Sherman appeared in federal court Jan. 27 andpleaded guilty to accepting bribes in exchange for providingconfidential contract information to consultants and companies.   He could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of as much as$500,000 when sentenced April 7.   Sherman, until identified in court papers last summer inconnection with the probe, worked as a contracting officer in thecorps' installation and logistics department in Washington. Afterbeing identified in federal search warrants, he was transferred toanother administrative job that did not involve the award ofcontracts.   The federal investigation, known as Operation Ill Wind, has beenunderway for at least two years. It focuses on allegations thatprivate consultants, hired by defense contractors, bribed Pentagonofficials to obtain inside information that gave companies an edgein securing contracts.   The first indictment in the case was handed down Jan. 6, namingone defense contractor and a handful of individuals. In addition,another company and eight individuals have entered guilty pleas tovarious charges.   Sherman, before being transferred to new duties, had a range ofcontacts with consultants and companies.   For instance, prosecutors said last week he received a total of$43,500 between October 1986 and June 1987 from an unnamedconsultant who was working for the FBI. The bureau provided themoney for the bribes, which Sherman said he put in a savings accountand used to build a room on his house.   Agents recorded 16 meetings between the consultant and Sherman,prosecutors said.   They did not divulge the names of the consultants or thecompanies that paid Sherman, but an affadavit released earlier saidhe had links to William Parkin, a defense consultant who has beenindicted.   Parkin and his associates were seeking to buy and sellinformation about the Advanced Tactical Air Command Central, an$80-million contract sought by a number of defense contractors.   Sherman was joined in entering a guilty plea last week by twoother men with ties to the Unisys Corp., the giant computer maker.   The Navy announced Monday it had forwarded information aboutthose two men to the ``Navy Debarment Committee and to the DefenseContract Audit Agency for identification and recovery of any sumsimproperly charged the government under defense contracts.''   Robert D. Barrett, a former executive at Unisys, and Joseph E.Hill, a consultant paid by Unisys, pleaded guilty to making illegalcampaign contributions to members of Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
