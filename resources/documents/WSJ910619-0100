The people of Bangladesh areannually visited by floods, cyclones and typhoons of trulyepic proportions. Last month's storm claimed the lives oftens of thousands. But despite natural disaster, Bangladeshfights on. Bangladesh even contributed a small detachment oftroops to Operation Desert Storm.   So how do we as Americans express our sympathy for and ourgratitude to Bangladesh? Do we forgive its debts? Do weestablish new businesses there? No. We are repayingBangladesh by attacking its fledgling economy withallegations of unfair trade practices and the threat of tradesanctions.</LP><TEXT>   Even the most protectionist corporate observer must wonderwhat export from Bangladesh could threaten or materiallyinjure a U.S. industry? Is it semiconductors? SurelyAmericans have nothing to fear from chip imports fromBangladesh. What about cars? The U.S. automobile industry isnot under pressure from Bangladeshi car manufacturers. No,the vital area of our economy that is protesting Bangladeshiexports is the crucial shop towel industry.   A U.S. textile company asserts that Bangladeshmanufacturers of &quot;industrial wiping cloths&quot; are dumping theirproducts in the U.S. market. &quot;Industrial wiping cloths&quot; aremore commonly referred to as shop towels and better known tolaymen as just plain rags. This petition to the U.S.International Trade commission was filed by the textilegiant, Milliken andamp; Co.   The allegedly dumped rags from Bangladesh represented amere $2.46 million in U.S. sales in 1990. Milliken isestimated to have sales of more than $2.5 billion annually.This year, the threat of Bangladeshi competition has beenreduced even further by the recent flooding, which hascovered the Bangladeshi &quot;factories&quot; -- full of foot-poweredlooms -- with several feet of water.   The U.S. International Trade Commission is investigatingthe dumping complaint. Milliken, the self-appointed leader inprotecting the textile industry, fought the same battles in1983 and 1984 with the twin industrial giants, China andPakistan.   Milliken also asserts that the Bangladesh shop towelindustry received export subsidies from the Bangladeshgovernment that materially injure the U.S. market for theseitems. Fortunately for Bangladesh, the U.S. Department ofCommerce has dismissed this claim, determining that the 0.02%export subsidy paid by Bangladesh to the shop towel exportersis de minimis.   The U.S. textile industry already has the protection ofthe Multi-Fiber Agreement, which limits imports into thiscountry. These textiles usually are produced in poorcountries, many of them faced with economic disaster. Toameliorate the economic harm caused by these textile quotas,the U.S. then gives these nations foreign aid. In essence,the U.S. is giving less developed countries internationalwelfare to keep them from working. It is time to throw in thetowel.   ---   Mr. Lash, a professor at St. Louis University School ofLaw, served as counsel to the chairman of the U.S.International Trade Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
