Robinson Jr. told jurors. ``Obedience toillegal orders is no defense.''   The judge said that only if Younis did not know that hijackingwas illegal should he be acquitted.   The jury deliberated for about for hours. Deliberations willresume Monday.   Younis was on the stand for two days in the nine-day trial,testifying that the military commander of Lebanon's Amal militia,Aqil Hamiyya, ordered him to lead four other heavily armed men inthe hijacking of Royal Jordanian Airlines flight 402 on June 11,1985.   Under cross-examination, Younis has testified that he knew thathijacking was illegal in peacetime, and that Amal was not at warwith Royal Jordanian Airlines, the government of Jordan, the twoAmericans aboard the aircraft, or any of the other 70 passengers andcrew members.   He did not attempt to refute testimony by five eyewitnesses whopointed him out in the courtroom as the leader in the hijacking.   Defense attorney Frank D. Carter sought to persuade the jury thatYounis acted as he did because he was a victim of the civil war thathas engulfed Lebanon since 1975.   Younis, now 30, was arrested on Sept. 13, 1987, by members of theFBI hostage rescue team who, working closely with the U.S. militaryand intelligence agencies, lured him aboard a yacht in internationalwaters in the Mediterranean Sea.   The case is viewed as a test of a 1984 ``long-arm'' statute thatasserts U.S. jurisdiction over cases involving American hostagestaken abroad.   The counts against Younis, and the maximum possible sentences foreach, are: hostage taking, life in prison; aircraft piracy, 20years; performing acts of violence against individuals, 20 years;destruction of a civilian aircraft, 20 years; carrying aboard anaircraft devices likely to endanger its safety, 20 years, andconspiracy to commit a hijacking, five years.</TEXT></DOC>
