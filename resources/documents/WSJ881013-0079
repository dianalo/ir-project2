The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which just two days earlier had reached its highest level since prices collapsed almost a year ago, plummeted 30.23 to 2126.24.    Prices came under pressure from the opening bell as the market reacted to an overnight drop in the dollar and a subsequent downturn in bond prices. &quot;You kind of knew you were looking at something that would be sloppy at best coming into the gate,&quot; said Mel Deichman, head of U.S. equity trading at Deutsche Bank Capital.    Stocks drifted at sharply lower levels for most of the session and reached the day's lows at midafternoon amid concern about the trade data, scheduled for release before the market opens Thursday.    There was some speculation that the trade deficit for August would be considerably larger than current estimates, traders said. A recent survey of economists by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report produced a consensus estimate of $11.3 billion for the August deficit, compared with July's trade gap of $9.53 billion.    Traders also attributed the market's slide to rumors, which couldn't be substantiated, that a Japanese institution had sold its portfolio of U.S. shares. The speculation centered on Nihon Tochi, an Osaka-based real estate company active in the Tokyo stock market, which reportedly filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan.    Broader market measures mimicked the downturn in the Dow Jones industrials. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 3.95 to 273.98, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index went down 2.00 to 154.77. Also, 1,114 issues declined in price on the Big Board, while only 397 advanced.    Despite the market's slump, traders said selling pressure remained fairly modest. New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 154,840,000 shares, up from 140,900,000 Tuesday.    Deutsche Bank's Mr. Deichman said he doesn't expect the market's latest drop to evolve into a full-fledged retreat from its post-crash highs. &quot;There seems to be much more unfilled demand on the part of institutions than uncompleted sell orders,&quot; he said.    Despite the nervousness about the trade data, Peter Canelo, a market strategist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., said he doesn't expect the report -- or other imminent economic news -- to present much of a problem for the market no matter what the results may be.    &quot;If we can't get any further selling out of it, the market will probably turn right around,&quot; he said. &quot;The market will realize the trend in the numbers is better -- a slowing economy, slowing inflation and improved trade.&quot;    In the next few days, the government is scheduled to release reports on the producer price index, industrial production and retail sales for September.    While contending that the market &quot;has worked itself up into quite a lather&quot; over the economic data, Mr. Canelo said he views the market's inability to move decisively past its post-crash peaks as an indication that investors have made &quot;a technical judgment&quot; that the market isn't ready for such an advance.    &quot;Maybe traders are right here to take profits at the top end of the range, but I think that's a risky strategy,&quot; he said. &quot;If you have a sense that the fundamentals are moving in the right direction, it's best to hold on and not try to be too smart.&quot;    Edward G. Webb Jr., a senior vice president at Bull andamp; Bear Group, suggested that it could be another six months before stocks will escape from a trading range environment.    With the market holding fairly steady at the moment despite concerns about everything from the economy and inflation to the outlook for corporate earnings and the presidential election, Mr. Webb said he expects the market to break out with an advance. &quot;The bias is up; the question is how long it takes to get it rolling,&quot; he said.    Motorola plunged 2 7/8 to 39 3/4 as its third-quarter earnings report proved to be a disappointment for the market. The company posted net income of 67 cents a share for the quarter, up from 54 cents a year earlier but well below analysts' expectations.    Several blue-chip issues were also pummeled in the market's retreat. General Motors dropped 1 3/8 to 73 7/8, Merck skidded 1 1/2 to 57 5/8, McDonald's fell 1 5/8 to 48 5/8, Philip Morris dropped 1 7/8 to 98 7/8 and Boeing fell 1 1/2 to 64 1/2.    While other technology issues were generally lower, there were two notable exceptions. Digital Equipment, which climbed 1 3/4 points Tuesday on news of its plans to raise prices, gained 5/8 to 90 1/2. Advanced Micro Devices rose 5/8 to 9 7/8 to extend a rally that began after Prudential-Bache Securities raised its opinion of the stock and rumors surfaced that Siemens, which has a 10.5% stake in the company, might attempt to buy the rest.    Kroger, which fell 2 5/8 points Tuesday after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts withdrew its takeover proposal, rebounded 1 to 56 in Big Board composite trading of four million shares. The shares to be issued under the company's recapitalization plan rose 1/2 to 8 5/8 in equally heavy when-issued trading after a decline of 1 5/8 points the day before.    Phillips Petroleum went up 1 3/4 to 22 3/8 as 4.2 million shares changed hands in composite trading amid intensifying takeover speculation. Traders at two large brokerages said Royal Dutch-Shell Group is rumored to be considering an offer for the company.    Holly Farms soared 6 5/8 to 49 5/8 in the wake of a Tyson Foods offer of $45 in cash and 0.25 share of its Class A common stock for each of the company's shares. Tyson, whose Class A shares fell 5/8 to 17 on the over-the-counter market, said it is prepared to increase its takeover bid in negotiations.    Walgreen rose 1 1/4 to 35 1/4. The company said the Haft family, which controls Dart Group and has made a number of unsuccessful bids for other retailers, is seeking federal clearance to acquire $15 million or more of its common stock. F.W. Woolworth, a previous target of the Hafts, fell 1 1/8 to 54 3/8.    Chicago Pacific jumped 2 3/4 to 41 3/4. Traders said the sharp gain resulted from a recurrence of takeover speculation and other factors that have raised the stock recently. Rorer Group, another rumored takeover target, gained 1 3/8 to 40 1/4.    Federal National Mortgage Association rose 1 1/4 to 49 1/8 on the strength of its third-quarter earnings report, which showed that net income jumped to $1.65 a share from 74 cents a year earlier. The latest results were better than analysts had expected.    The American Stock Exchange index fell 1.86 to 301.91. Volume totaled 8,920,000 shares, up from 8,160,000 Tuesday. There were 238 issues advancing and 346 declining.    Ransburg jumped 3 to 13 1/2. LFC Financial, a financial services firm based in Radnor, Pa., proposed acquiring the company for $15.25 a share.    Texas Air fell 1 3/8 to 14 7/8. The company said it expects to realize a $240 million gain from the sale of the Eastern Air Shuttle by its Eastern Airlines unit to Donald Trump for $365 million, but Texas Air's chairman, Frank Lorenzo, said he doubted talks with TWA's Carl Icahn would result in the sale of the rest of Eastern.    Postal Instant Press advanced 1 1/4 to 14 1/4. The company amended a merger agreement with PIP Holdings, a management-led buy-out group, to reduce the cash portion of the deal to $15.50 a share from about $17.41 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
