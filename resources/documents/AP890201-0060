(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge ordered the release of a manaccused of trying to export nerve gas, despite the government'scontention that the suspect was a threat to national securitybecause he held highly sensitive classified documents.   Juhwan Yun was scheduled to be released on $2 million bail thisafternoon after U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin ruled that thegovernment had failed to demonstrate that Yun was a risk to flee.Federal prosecutors are appealing the ruling.   At a hearing Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer hadargued that the Korean-American businessman's ties with foreigngovernments and military bases abroad would make him likely to fleeto avoid prosecution.   Singer also disclosed that Yun, 48, of Short Hills, N.J., helddocuments revealing the United States' capability to intercept enemycommunications. She said the documents were found on a desk at Yun'simport-export business.   ``Yun appears to have had contact with individuals in orassociated with branches of the U.S. military and-or militaryinstallations abroad,'' Ms. Singer said in a letter to the court.   ``Revelation of the information would not only compromisespecifics of our EW (Electronic Warfare) capabilities but would alsoreveal details of our knowledge of enemy threat,'' Navy Capt. M.Oetinger, vice director of the Pentagon's Joint Electronic WarfareCenter, said in a memorandum to the U.S. Customs Service.   Yun was arrested Jan. 12 by U.S. Customs Agents when he arrivedfor a meeting with an undercover agent he believed was an armsdealer.   Military documents found afterward in Yun's office were used bythe government previously to argue that Yun should not be releasedon bail. Ms. Singer has argued that Yun apparently had contacts withseveral foreign governments, which would prefer he not stand trialin the case.   The government previously has said Yun may have had contacts atU.S. military installations. The documents filed Tuesday reveal forthe first time that those contacts may have been at U.S. bases inother countries.   Lt. Col. Arnie Williams, a spokesman for the Pentagon, declinedcomment until he had time to review the new government disclosures.   The new information also alleges that Korean-language documentsmarked ``Secret'' show how much is known about an unidentifiedenemy's electronic signals and gives details of specialized warfaresystems expected for use in the year 1992 and beyond.   Although the documents were in Korean, the government's newfilings do not say if they were from the South Korean government orif the enemy mentioned was North Korea.   The documents also discussed electronic countermeasures, thejamming of enemy signals and the deposition, numbers and locationsof enemy forces, according to the court papers.   Yun is charged along with a British national for allegedlyplotting to buy the nerve gas sarin and other military equipment forexport. Authorities have said the nerve gas's possible destinationwas Iran.   Richard Cimusz, an FBI counterintelligence agent, said in a newaffidavit filed Tuesday that Yun had been investigated previouslyfor allegedly trying to obtain other military equipment, includingnight-vision equipment, fighter planes and tank parts.   The government has said Yun boasted of high-level military andcivilian contacts with Yugoslavia, the People's Republic of Chinaand South Korea.   Cimusz said Yun has had contact with officials of two differentcountries that ``are of counterintellgence interest to the FBI'' andthat he had ``official documents from a third country ofcounterintelligence interest to the FBI.''</TEXT></DOC>
