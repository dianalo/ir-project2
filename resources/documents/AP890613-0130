The Commerce Department said the deficit in the current account,which had fallen for two consecutive quarters, jumped 7 percent.Analysts viewed the setback as disturbing evidence of how severeAmerica's trading problems are.   Meanwhile, the government also reported Tuesday that retailsales, held back by weak auto and department store sales, rose aslim 0.1 percent in May.   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, isthe most important trade statistic because it measures not onlytrade in merchandise but also transactions in services, primarilyinvestment flows between countries.   For the first three months of the year, the merchandise portionof the deficit showed a marked improvement, narrowing by 13.7percent to $27.63 billion, the smallest deficit for merchandisetrade in four years.   That improvement was offset, however, by a steep drop in theservices category, which fell to a tiny surplus of $369 million froma surplus of $8.36 billion in the fourth quarter of 1988.   Most of the first quarter decline was blamed on the rising valueof the dollar, which lowers the profits of U.S. companies operatingoverseas because their foreign earnings buy less when they arechanged back into dollars.   Beyond the currency movements, analysts said the trade report wasdisturbing because it reflected the fact that America, once theworld's largest creditor nation, is now its largest debtor.   Simply put, that means foreigners now own more in investments inthe United States than Americans hold in overseas investments. Thetotal excess of foreign holdings is estimated to have risen above$500 billion last year although the government's official accountingof the U.S. net debtor status will not be released until June 29.   Many economists believe America's standard of living willdeteriorate in coming years as the country is forced to transfermore and more of its wealth into foreign hands to service itsforeign debt.   ``The current account reflects how much we have to continue toborrow,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``Herewe are doing so much better on our merchandise exports, but we arestill hurting because of our increasing debtor status.''   Cynthia Latta, senior economist at Data Resources Inc., said shebelieved a decline in living standards could already be seen in theweak growth over the last few years in personal incomes afteradjusting for inflation.   ``We are already starting to feel the effects of the consumptionbinge the country has been on,'' she said. ``At some point we haveto slow our consumption'' by saving more and thus lessening the needto import foreign capital.   The current account provides a measure of the amount of moneythis country must raise abroad to finance its economy.   At the start of this decade, the United States was runningsurpluses in its current account because earnings from Americaninvestments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits inmerchandise trade.   But as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreignhands to pay for imported cars and televisions, the investmentcushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985, whenAmerica became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.   The changed status has stired a political debate over whethergrowing foreign ownership of American companies, real estate andTreasury bonds means that the United States is transfering controlof its economic destiny to foreigners.   Tuesday's report said that in addition to the $27.63 billiondeficit in merchandise trade and the slight $369 million surplus inthe services category, the $30.69 billion current account deficitreflected payments of $3.42 billion in foreign aid and pensions toAmericans living overseas.   The government is due to release on Thursday its estimate of themerchandise trade deficit for April. In advance of that report, manyanalysts were looking for little change from the March monthlydeficit figure of $8.86 billion.   In the report on retail sales, the Commerce Department said thetiny 0.1 percent increase put May sales at a seasonally adjusted$141.1 billion.   Analysts said they expected this sluggishness to continue asconsumers' saw their purchasing power constrained by higher energyand food costs.</TEXT></DOC>
