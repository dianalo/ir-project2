The official Communist Party daily Granma said themeasures would initially save 150,000 tons of oil a year.Cuba imports annually nearly 13 million tons of oil from theSoviets, but President Fidel Castro has warned Cubans to beprepared in case events in the Soviet Union lead to a cuttingoff of the fuel lifeline.
