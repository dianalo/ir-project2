Kenneth Williams, ActingChief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,Room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 Fairfax Dr., Arlington, Virginia22201 (703/358-1714), or write Director (FWS/MBMO), Mail Stop 634-ArlingtonSquare, 18th andamp; C Streets NW., Washington, DC 20240.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This rule implements the third year(1989-90) of the 5-year component of the strategy to phase-in a nontoxicshot requirement for waterfowl hunting nationwide by 1991-92, as set outby the preferred alternative of the Final SEIS on the Use of Lead Shotfor Hunting Migratory Birds in the United States published in June 1986(FES 86-16). The SEIS and consequent rulemakings imposing nontoxic shotrequirements result from the Secretary of Interior's responsibilities underthe Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), as amended (16 U.S.C. 703 <T3>et seq.; </T3>40 Stat. 755), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) ofl973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; 87 Stat. 884), to decide whether,where and how migratory bird hunting will be allowed. A critical elementin the Department of the Interior's deliberations and decision to implementand enforce regulations establishing nontoxic shot zones nationwide hasbeen the determination that lead poisoning resulting from waterfowl huntingis a significant annual mortality factor in certain migratory birds. Information detailing the scientific basis for concluding that lead shotfrom waterfowling is causing lead poisoning in certain migratory birdsand the development of the strategy to eliminate lead toxicity as a majormortality factor, including discussions of the issues for and against lead/steelshot, appears in the SEIS and the preamble to the proposed rule on thecriteria and schedule for implementing nontoxic shot zones for 1987-88and subsequent years published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 27, 1986 (51 FR 23444). The final rulefor that proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 21, 1986 (51 FR 42103). Informationon the justification for selecting this strategy has also been set outin the Final SEIS (Alternative VII<T2>3</T2>), the June 27, 1986, proposed rule and in the Record of Decisionconfirming the preferred alternative and published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 20, 1986 (51 FR 29673). Additionalinformation relating to the imposition of nontoxic shot zones nationwide,according to the 5-year schedule, is contained in the final rules for the1987-88 and 1988-89 waterfowl hunting seasons published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on Tuesday, July 21, 1987 (52 FR 27352) and onTuesday, June 28, 1988 (53 FR 24284), respectively. Counties scheduled to convert in their entireties to nontoxic shot in the1989-90 waterfowl season are those counties having had an average annualwaterfowl harvest of 10 or more per square mile over the 10-year period1971-80. As scheduled, approximately 79 percent of the waterfowl harvestnationwide will occur in nontoxic shot zones in the 1989-90 waterfowl huntingseason. However, the conversion of many entire States ahead of the scheduleis estimated to increase waterfowl harvest occurring in nontoxic shot zonesto be about 90 percent of the total harvest in this 1989-90 waterfowl huntingseason. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of General Public Comment on the Proposed Rule </ITAG>Not considering State responses, one letter of comment was received onthe proposed rule (53 FR 45296) for this final rule during the 30-day commentperiod that ended on December 9, 1988. In this letter, the Wildlife Legislative Fund of America (Fund) objectedto the plan to implement a nontoxic shot phase-in nationwide. The Fundquestioned the Fish and Wildlife Service's (Service) assumptions with regardto the necessity to phase out the use of lead shot for waterfowling as``lacking scientific basis.'' The Fund stated that it had endorsed the``hotspot'' approach to prohibit use of lead shot for waterfowling as amethod that is effective in meeting the objective of protecting migratorybird and endangered or threatened bird species, and one that is fair inmeeting the needs and wishes of the waterfowl hunters. The comments of the Fund with regard to ``hotspots'' are within the scopeof earlier rulemakings. Those comments will not be responded to in thisfinal rule as they are similar, if not identical, to comments receivedfrom the general public on the proposed rule titled ``Zones in which leadshot will be prohibited for waterfowl and coot hunting in the 1986-87 huntingseason'' of January 6, 1986 (51 FR 409), and were responded to as a preliminaryfinal rule in Appendix O of the final SEIS on the use of lead shot forhunting migratory birds in the United States completed in June of 1986and announced in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on June 27, 1986 (51 FR 23444), and July 11,1986 (5l FR 25249). The preliminary final rule referenced above (Appendix O), with commentsand responses, was published as a final rule on September 3, 1986 (51 FR31429). Discussions pertinent to the comments of the Fund and presented in theFinal SEIS (referenced accordingly) and/or presented in the Issues sectionof the September 3, 1986, nontoxic shot zone rule for the 1986-87 waterfowlhunting season (51 FR 31429) are as follows: andbullet; Arguments against the lead shot-lead poisoning connection in waterfowland bald eagles, including situations involving shooting over fields andover deep water, observers noting absence of carcasses, perceived documentationdeficiencies, etc. (see, for example, Issues 1, 2, 7 and 8 Chapter IIIof the SEIS); andbullet; Relative merits of the ``hotspots'' approach vs. the current phase-instrategy (see, for example, Issue 5 and Chapters II and IV of the SEIS);and andbullet; General allegations of arbitrariness in Service actions to eliminatelead poisoning as a mortality factor in waterfowl and coots (see, for example,Issue 3). <ITAG tagnum="84">State-by-State Comments and Responses for the Proposed Rule </ITAG>In summary, 11 of the affected 47 States directly responded to or in anticipationof the proposed rule published on November 9, 1988 (53 FR 45296), regarding``Zones in which lead shot will be prohibited for hunting waterfowl, cootsand certain other species in the 1988-89 hunting season.'' All of the Statesnot providing written comment within the comment period were contactedeither by the Service's Regional Offices or the Office of Migratory BirdManagement to confirm that notification of the proposed rulemaking hadbeen made. It is the policy of the Service that States will continue tobe consulted annually with regard to the descriptions of converting zonesthrough the 1991-92 waterfowl season nationwide phase-in of nontoxic shot.Two States are noted to have major zone change differences when comparingthe proposed and final rules; these States are New Hampshire and NorthDakota. Twenty States will have a statewide nontoxic shot requirement inthe 1989-90 waterfowl hunting season.Individual comments of the 11 States responding to the proposed rule, duringthe comment period, are as follows: California The California Department of Fish and Game advised that a descriptive errorexisted with regard to Lassen County, i.e., the boundary description forthe Northeastern Zone does not, nor is it intended to, include all of LassenCounty. Thus, the final rule revises the descriptive language to show thatmost but not all of Lassen County is restricted to the use of nontoxicshot for waterfowl hunting. Georgia The Georgia Department of Natural Resources (Department) recommended addingfour managed waterfowl impoundments as nontoxic shot areas. One waterfowlimpoundment is in McIntosh County, a converting county, the others areOconee WMA in Green County, West Point WMA in Hurd County and Lake Julietteon Rum Creek WMA in Monroe County. Additionally, the Department advisedthat it would be proposing a resident goose harvest for the 1989-90 season,and that affected counties would be designated nontoxic shot for geeseonly. The Service, in turn, advised the Department that the managed waterfowlimpoundments will be included in the final rule but that the requestedcounties for a resident goose season will be held in abeyance pending approvalof an appropriate regulation. Addition of these counties to existing nontoxicshot zones may then be done by Federal regulation amendment or by Stateregulation only. Idaho The Idaho Department of Fish and Game agreed to implementation and enforcementof nontoxic shot requirements in the zones described in the proposed rulefor the 1989-90 waterfowl hunting season. The only change from the 1988-89descriptions for Idaho is the addition of the remainder of Bannock Countyto the Southeastern Zone. Kansas The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks approves and supports the implementationand enforcement of nontoxic shot restrictions in the Kansas zones describedherein for the 1989-90 waterfowl season. Nevada The Nevada Department of Wildlife concurs and supports the 1989-90 nontoxicshot zoning proposed for the State of Nevada.New Hampshire The State of New Hampshire Fish and Game Department informed the Servicethat it would convert statewide for nontoxic shot in the 1989-90 waterfowlhunting season. North Carolina The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission advised the Service thatthe proposed nontoxic shot zones for the 1989-90 season would be expanded.Thus, in addition to New Hanover County, the other areas included are asfollows: (a) New Hope Game Land, (b) Butner-Falls of Neuse Game Land and(c) posted waterfowl impoundments on other game lands. North Carolina wasinformed by letter that these areas would be added to existing nontoxicshot zones for the 1989-90 waterfowl hunting season. North Dakota The North Dakota Game and Fish Department provided verification of their1986 announced schedule to implement nontoxic shot for waterfowl huntingstatewide in the 1989-90 season. In North Dakota, this requirement is beingextended to include sandhill crane and snipe. Oklahoma The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation (Department) redescribedOklahoma's nontoxic shot zones provided in the proposed rule, on the basisof county and highway boundaries, for better delineation. In several casesthe Department has included additional areas of adjoining counties in orderto encompass lakes bisected by county lines. Texas The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department expressed appreciation for theopportunity to review the proposed rule. Utah The Resource Development Coordinating Committee of the State of Utah advisedthat no potentially affected State agencies had commented on the proposedrule. In summary, this rule amends section 20.108 of 50 CFR to add areas to expandexisting nontoxic shot zones for the 1989-90 waterfowl hunting season.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Effect </ITAG>Executive Order 12291, ``Federal Regulation,'' of February 17, 1981, requiresthe preparation of regulatory impact analyses for major rules. A majorrule is one likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, government agencies or geographic regions; or significant adverseeffects on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete withforeign-based enterprises. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) further requires the preparation of flexibility analysesfor rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, which includes small businesses, organizations and/or governmentaljurisdictions. In accordance with Executive Order 12291, a determination has been madethat this rule is not a major rule. In accordance with the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, a determination has been made that this rule, if implemented withoutadequate notice, could result in lead shot ammunition supplies for whichthere would be no local demand. Conversely, nontoxic shot zones could conceivablybe established where little or no nontoxic shot ammunition would be availableto hunters. The Service believes, however, that adequate notice has beenprovided and that sufficient supplies of nontoxic shot ammunition willbe available to hunters. Therefore, this rule would not have a significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rule will not result in the collection of information from, or placerecordkeeping requirements on, the public under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations </ITAG>Pursuant to the requirements of section 102(2)(C) of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(C)), a Final Environmental Statement(FES) on the use of steel shot for hunting waterfowl in the United Stateswas published in 1976. As stated above, a supplement to the FES was completedin June 1986. In this supplement, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act,a ``section 7'' consultation was done on the potential impacts of the provisionsof this rule on bald eagles. The ``section 7'' opinion concluded that implementationof the preferred alternative would not be likely to jeopardize the continuedexistence of the bald eagle. Also, a ``section 7'' opinion has concludedthat the action being carried out is not likely to jeopardize the continuedexistence of the Aleutian Canada goose. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L0,tp9,p0,7/3,i1,s100 </C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Counties proposed (at </T4>53 <T4>FR </T4>45296<T4>) to be added in </T4>1989-90 <T4>to the existing zones where the hunting of waterfowl, coot and certainother species is limited to the use of nontoxic shot.
