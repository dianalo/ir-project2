His wife and two daughters watch in solemnembarrassment.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Prado's interrogator, Angel Loredo, paces the floor,playing with a long rubber band. &quot;Ignacio, he's not Mexicanand he's not George Washington or George Bush,&quot; he saysimpatiently. Mr. Prado's eyes light up. &quot;Dan Quayle,&quot; heblurts out. &quot;God no,&quot; wails Mr. Loredo, who hurls the rubberband in frustration and orders everyone to repeat: &quot;I want tolearn. I will learn. I'm going to learn.&quot;   But Mr. Prado's problem isn't ignorance of history. Whenthe counselor repeats the same question in Spanish, Mr. Pradogets it right.   So goes another teeth-grinding day in amnesty class, partof a $4 billion government effort to quickly assimilate thelargest single group of newly legalized immigrants in U.S.history.   Mr. Prado, a native of Monterrey, Mexico, hid fromimmigration officials for more than 20 years. He is one ofabout 1.7 million undocumented aliens who were grantedtemporary resident status under the amnesty provisions of thehistoric immigration reform law of 1986. But, it turns out,they weren't home free.   To gain permanent resident status by November -- thedeadline set by the law for most of them -- the immigrantsmust show proficiency in the English language and knowledgeof U.S. history and civics. A majority of amnesty-seekers tryto meet these requirements by taking 40-hour cram coursessponsored by the government.   Previous immigrants didn't have to worry about languageand history unless they were seeking U.S. citizenship. But toget the reform bill passed with the controversial amnestyconcept intact, congressional supporters agreed to thestiffer requirements. &quot;There was a sense of making theapplicants earn their legal status,&quot; says Michael Zamba, adirector of the National Association of Latino Elected andAppointed Officials, known as NALEO.   Now, however, a growing number of critics say the cramcourses are a waste of money for taxpayers and a humiliatingritual for immigrants. &quot;Why kid ourselves?&quot; asks Robert M.Paral, an NALEO immigration policy analyst. &quot;How can anyoneexpect a person to learn English in 40 hours? It's simplyunrealistic.&quot;   The Immigration and Naturalization Service apparentlythinks so too. It declines to deport any immigrants as longas they get a certificate from their teacher asserting theyput forth a &quot;good-faith effort&quot; to learn the requiredsubjects.   &quot;I was told by a supervisor if a student is there for 40hours, give him a certificate -- no questions asked,&quot; saysSusan McBride, a teacher in an amnesty class. At last count,95% of the applicants taking the course nationwide havepassed, although, like Mr. Prado, few have mastered theintricacies of English or the three branches of thegovernment.   The near certainty of passing doesn't make the program anyless painful for the immigrants. Consider the experiences ofMr. Prado's class of 42 immigrants -- construction workers,cooks, bus boys and maids -- which met three times a week fora month and a half in a brightly lit room at St. AugustineCatholic Church.   It is Saturday, the end of the first week, and somestudents, unable to afford babysitters, have brought theirchildren to class. When Ms. McBride, the teacher, steps outfor a few minutes, the students give vent to theirfrustrations. &quot;I don't understand this in English or Spanish,I don't, I don't,&quot; moans Hermelinda Garibaldi, banging herhead on a desktop.   Other students agonize loudly over a list of singular andplural nouns. Jesus Reyes, whose name is taped to hisworkshirt, tries to restore order. &quot;Don't lose hope,&quot; hebellows. &quot;We've made it this far.&quot;   Ms. McBride reappears, a bit overwhelmed by the chaos.&quot;Relax. Stand up. Take a deep breath and say, `We're having agood day,'&quot; she croons in the time-honored patter of thethird-grade school teacher she is. The exercise pacifies thestudents momentarily, but as soon as classwork resumes, sodoes the fidgeting. &quot;Maybe I'm throwing out too much, toosoon,&quot; Ms. McBride concedes.   As the hour draws to a close, Ms. McBride flips throughher Spanish-English dictionary and reads out the word &quot;tarea&quot;-- homework. She then hands out mimeographed sheets withfill-in-the-blank grammar questions -- her only option, sincetextbooks haven't arrived. The students groan. &quot;Aw, c'mon,break your head a little,&quot; the teacher implores, tapping herown head with a fist. &quot;It won't hurt.&quot;   But it feels painful for most of these harried students.Many don't relish demonstrating their lack of education.Others are just bone-weary from long hours at their jobs.Aura Sanchez, 25, a housekeeper with two children and a thirdon the way, works a full day while her mother-in-law caresfor her two preschool-age children; the classroom burdensonly add to her parental guilt. &quot;Sometimes I feel as thoughI'm being a bad mother, neglecting my children,&quot; she says.   During the second week, 28 slower learners are transferredto John Lopez's classroom. Normally a seventh-grade teacher,Mr. Lopez asks the students to name the 13 original colonies.   &quot;Teacher, no more questions,&quot; Ms. Garibaldi pleads. &quot;Myhead feel no good.&quot; And then, slipping into Spanish, &quot;I haveto get up at 5 a.m. to work.&quot; Ms. Garibaldi cleans downtownoffice buildings from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. every morning,supplementing her meager pay with part-time housekeeping andwaitressing jobs.   It is that kind of existence these students hope toescape. For most of them, life prior to amnesty was one ofuncertainty and fear. Mr. Prado spent several years buildinga small food-distribution business; as an illegal immigrant,he could have lost it in a heartbeat.   At the next session, Mr. Lopez and Ms. McBride introduce atutor named Angelina, a high-school student who emigratedhere from Jalisco, Mexico. She works with students who arepractically illiterate, even in Spanish, and thus in need ofmore one-to-one attention. But by the end of the week, thefunds to cover Angelina's salary still haven't been approvedby a web of federal, state and local agencies. With noguarantee that her wages will ever be approved, she quits.   The third week brings more bad news. Because funds areheld up, the textbooks still haven't arrived. And now Mr.Lopez announces they probably won't be available until a fewdays before graduation. He has been covertly making copies ofhis teacher's manual for the students. The manual containsthe same material as the textbooks, but includes the answersto study questions in the back. &quot;I've already been caughtonce,&quot; he confesses, adding that he was let off with awarning by school officials. &quot;But my students are moreimportant. This is their only chance to learn.&quot;   Mr. Lopez's group seems buried in despair, struggling withthe simplest of concepts, such as the colors of the flag. Bycontrast, Ms. McBride's much-smaller advanced group, peoplewho came into the class with a firmer grasp of English,easily discuss predicate nouns and the three branches ofgovernment. &quot;We're rolling now,&quot; she says. &quot;Next thing youknow, they'll be asking for a pay raise.&quot;   Over the next few sessions, the cocky advanced group evenengages in bilingual debates on U.S. democracy, civil rightsand press freedoms. Maria Gomez, a native of Mexico City,offers to recite the preamble to the Constitution. &quot;We thepeople . . . &quot; she begins, painstakingly completing thepassage amid cheers and a standing ovation from her jubilantclassmates. Ms. McBride is teary-eyed.   The books finally arrive during week five, but only threeclasses remain. Some students consider petitioning for moreclassroom hours. Liliana Anaya, 24, a secretary at a clothingfactory, plans to continue language courses on her own. &quot;Myboss tells me that if I learn more English, I can work incomputers,&quot; she says.   On the last day of class, the final exam is overshadowedby plans for a party. But Vicenta Faz, 48, is weeping softly,fearful of failing the exam, fearful that her infrequentparticipation in class discussions will prompt the teacher towithhold her certificate. The night before, she barely slept.&quot;I'm scared because I don't think I've learned much,&quot; shesays.   But the final exam is easier than anticipated; only two ofthe 42 students fail and both are deemed worthy ofcertificates.   At graduation, with their hair slicked back, the men insuits and the women teetering on high-heeled shoes, the St.Augustine class listens intently as the keynote speaker,immigration attorney Juan Jasso, urges them to becomepolitically active in their new homeland.   Mr. Jasso, whose parents also are immigrants, addressesthem in Spanish, of course. &quot;Otherwise, they won't understandme,&quot; he explains.</TEXT></DOC>
