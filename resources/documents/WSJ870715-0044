Issue No. 2 is the heavy American presence here. It translates into a strong undercurrent of anti-Americanism, especially among younger Koreans.    The man in the street rails against American political &quot;meddling.&quot; The student demonstrator, in protest rallies and marches, calls for the removal of American troops. The Korean bureaucrat complains about American trade pressure.    An American diplomat, sizing up the tide of anti-American feeling over the past several months, says, &quot;We're the elephant on their back.&quot;    In its most extreme forms, the anti-U.S. feelings go hand in hand with a general anti-foreign sentiment and an intense, emotional Korean nationalism.    In the courtyard of the Chogye Buddhist temple the other week, Buddhist monks were angry that their anti-government demonstration had been broken up by police. But their most passionate outbursts were directed against the foreign influences they see as corrupting Korea.    They passed out literature decrying the &quot;pollution&quot; of Korean culture by Western ideas. They spoke against Christianity, which now claims more than 20% of the Korean populace as believers. One monk, declining to be interviewed, said, &quot;I don't even want to look at a foreigner.&quot;    Open hostility to foreigners actually is minimal in public places in South Korea, and many older Koreans still acknowledge a debt of gratitude to the U.S. for its help in repelling the North Korean Communists after World War II. Nevertheless, a resentment of foreign domination, the flip side of a burgeoning pride in Korean accomplishment, keeps roiling.    &quot;In the l950s, we Koreans had feelings of contempt for ourselves,&quot; says Kim Kook-Chin, an official at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security. &quot;Today, we're enjoying a revival of ourselves, our traditions. We're reaching world levels in sports and in trade. When our students go abroad, they go to the Ivy colleges, Harvard and Princeton. This is why we were so embarrassed last year when people started comparing us to the Philippines,&quot; where the economic stagnation stands in stark contrast to Korea's recent prosperity.    Such comparisons hurt because despite its unpopularity, President Chun Doo Hwan's government raised Koreans' ambitions -- socially, economically and politically. The most ambitious project of all is playing host to the 1988 summer Olympic Games. It is the crown jewel of Mr. Chun's reign and the most obvious example of a proud nation's eagerness to make a mark on the world scene.    Now, with President Chun Doo Hwan's acceptance of democratic reforms after the protest demonstrations against his government, Koreans are closer than ever to their goal of political freedom to go along with their economic success.    Partly because the U.S. helped push the government toward compromise, the feverish anti-Americanism of June has waned a bit, at least for now. During the demonstrations, U.S. officials repeatedly pressed President Chun to refrain from imposing martial law to quell the increasing social unrest. Opposition leader Kim Dae Jung and others have said they expected anti-Americanism to subside as a result of the promised reforms.    But anti-American feeling in South Korea won't so easily be uprooted. Koreans still bristle at what they consider a colonialist military presence of about 41,000 American troops and other personnel.    Kim Young Shik, a 20-year-old university student and a non-protester, laments that the American military influence here precludes an independent, autonomous Korea. &quot;Sometimes I feel allergic to Americans,&quot; he says. He claims that an American general &quot;is chief of the Korean military.&quot; In fact, an American general is in charge of only some South Korean troops.    As Mr. Kim and others suggest, today's anti-Americanism to some degree reflects an increasingly self-confident South Korea trying to escape the shadow of its mighty protector. With a booming economy, soaring skyscrapers, nearly 100% literacy and rising nationalist pride in Korean accomplishments, more and more Koreans are looking for a lot less meddling from the U.S.    Korean resentment of the U.S. also has been fed by trade frictions of recent years. In 1985, a dispute over dumping of Korean photo albums and U.S. efforts to enforce American copyrights led to a brief student occupation of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce office here.    The U.S. support for Mr. Chun's eight-year-old government, moreover, led many here to regard him as a puppet. &quot;There's been an assumption on the part of many Americans that they can mess around in Korea and that the Koreans really need the advice,&quot; says Horace Underwood, associate dean of Yonsei University and a longtime resident of South Korea. &quot;The Koreans are beginning to say, 'Where do you get off telling us what to do?'&quot;    Although this feeling is particularly strong among younger Koreans, their elders remember the U.S. help in fighting off the Communist invasion from north of the 38th parallel.    &quot;I still have these friends who are old colonels -- they're blood brothers from the war years,&quot; says Carroll Hodges, a special assistant to the deputy commander of U.S. Forces in Korea and a resident of more than 30 years. &quot;They walk with you {arm in arm} Korean-style. They truly appreciate you.&quot;    Older Koreans, especially in the countryside, still applaud the presence of the U.S. military. During &quot;Team Spirit&quot; military exercises in the spring, the American military vehicles on maneuver south of Seoul were greeted by smiles and waves from local residents. Few Koreans call for a total removal of U.S. forces, for fear of an attack by North Korea.    &quot;Koreans are schizophrenic on this,&quot; says a senior Western diplomat in Seoul. &quot;It's natural they want operational control of forces. Yet they know what U.S. forces can do.&quot;    On the other hand, those born after the end of the Korean War in 1953, having little emotional attachment to the U.S., can't understand their parents' sympathy with the U.S. (Similarly, some younger Koreans seem to have less intense anti-Japanese feelings than their parents, who remember the harsh rule of the latter days of Japanese colonial occupation, which began in 1910 and ended in 1945.)    After violent confrontations with police last month, a dozen Yonsei University students, coughing and wheezing from tear gas, were resting on the slope of a hill. Talking to a reporter, they described American joint business ventures in Korea as colonialism. &quot;It's just like England and India,&quot; one said.    They called Mr. Chun a &quot;puppet&quot; of the U.S. government. They criticized the U.S. for failing to prevent the so-called Kwangju uprising in l980, which is the root of much of Mr. Chun's unpopularity and a prominent source of anti-Americanism.    At Kwangju in 1980, Mr. Chun's government put down a rebellion using troops and heavy artillery. By government tally, 193 died, but dissident groups put the number far higher.    Many Koreans, including workers, white-collar employees and intellectuals, as well as students, have criticized the U.S. military for &quot;allowing&quot; the Korean military to dispatch troops to Kwangju. The American military has claimed that its span of control didn't cover such troops.    Although that kind of retaliation against protesters has been averted this time around, with U.S. prodding of the Chun government, anti-Americanism persists. &quot;It's part of that ancient xenophobia. It's a feeling that 'if it weren't for these nasty foreigners, everything would be fine,'&quot; says Mr. Underwood, the associate dean. &quot;I've felt that a bit of the anti-Americanism is scapegoating.&quot;    It is fashionable among some Korean intellectuals to blame the partition of North and South Korea in 1945 on the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The peninsula was divided at the 38th parallel to facilitate the disarming of the Japanese military. The Soviet Union occupied the northern sector and the U.S. the southern sector. After 42 years, the division still arouses intense passions. During rallies last month, citizens sang a hymn-like song that all Koreans learned in school, which dreams of the reunification of Korea.    The U.S. is &quot;one of two big superpowers responsible for the division of this peninsula,&quot; says Kwon Doo-Young, the chairman of the tiny opposition Social Democratic Party. &quot;This is so very tragic.&quot; The U.S. and Soviets, he adds, &quot;are mutually responsible for all our sufferings over the past decades.&quot;    With this background, anti-Americanism continues to be voiced by those skeptical of the government's intentions to follow through on its recent promises.    Housewife K.I. Lee calls the American pressure on Mr. Chun for a compromise &quot;too little, too late.&quot; And as smaller protest rallies keep reverberating, so do the anti-American chants. </TEXT></DOC>
