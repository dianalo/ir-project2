Water &quot;pockets&quot;are found around the periphery of the domes and in association with sedimentinclusions. Isotopic data indicate that these waters are formation watersthat have been mechanically wrapped into the domes during diapiric riseof the salt. Meteoric waters are actively leaking into the Avery Islandsalt mine. These leaks represent penetration of the salt by externalwaters. The mechanism of brine movement is unknown. A third water typein domal salt appears to be connate brines evaporated to potash facies.These brines are so concentrated that they turn to a gel at liquid nitrogentemperatures; they will not freeze. Isotopic analyses of fluid inclusionsin the bedded salts of the Palo Duro Basin indicate that the trappedwater is mainly connate evaporate water dating back to the time of saltdeposition. In the Avery Island salt dome, observations include ghostgrain boundaries defined by curviplanar arrays of fluid inclusions withincoarse halite crystals. These are either former grain boundaries or fracturesurfaces. Parallel planes of intracrystalline fluid inclusions clearlyindicate natural fracturing of salt with consequent movement of brine.Water appears to have migrated upwards of 50 meters from localized water&quot;pockets&quot; via these mechanisms.</TEXT></DOC>
