(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Although it's said Ernest Hemingway mayhave felt his hometown was Death in the Afternoon, this Chicagosuburb is planning a Moveable Feast to honor the writer on whatwould have been his 90th birthday.   ``He was a failure as a person, but as a writer, he was thegreatest,'' Morris Buske, historian of Oak Park's HemingwayFoundation, said Wednesday in a telephone interview.   ``He antagonized people. At his death he had few friends. He wasa braggart, he was cruel. He was basically insecure.''   Then why honor such a person?   ``Because he was the great writer,'' said Buske. ``It appearsmore and more that he was the best American writer of this century.''   Ernest Miller Hemingway _ Nobel Prize-winning author of ``Deathin the Afternoon,'' ``A Moveable Feast,'' ``The Sun Also Rises,''``For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' ``A Farewell to Arms'' and ``The OldMan and the Sea'' _ was born July 21, 1899, in Oak Park and livedhere until he was 18.   Every July, the foundation marks the occasion with a week ofevents. This year, a new U.S. postage stamp with Papa's portrait onit will be presented.   ``The biggest thing is the stamp, which will appear first in KeyWest on July 17 and in Oak Park on July 21,'' said Buske.   ``The Post Office announced they were issuing the stamp in KeyWest _ his home in later life _ and when we found about it, weraised such a fuss, they caved in and agreed to let us in on theevent. It's unusual for a bureaucracy.''   On July 21, Hemingway's son Jack will speak at a ceremony at theOak Park Post Office dedicating the stamp.   The weeklong birthday tribute begins Friday with a Bastille Daystreet party at a restaurant.   Also scheduled are: a Hemingway film festival introduced byanother son, Patrick; tours of the two houses the writer-to-be livedin; a gourmet picnic at $40 a person with menu items fromgranddaughter Joan's cookbook; and a family reunion of the burlywriter's two sons and assorted nieces, nephews and in-laws.   Buske said Oak Parkers who don't like Hemingway are quick toquote a line attributed to the bearded writer, that the suburb has``broad lawns and narrow minds.''   But Buske said he has done extensive research and has never beenable to confirm Hemingway ever said such a thing.   Scott Schwar, chairman of the Hemingway Foundation, said thequote ``gives the impression that he didn't like Oak Park and thatisn't true. He had a normal, happy childhood, and he got a goodeducation here.   ``His family was active in community affairs and in photographingthemselves. So we have plenty of photos,'' Schwar said.   Although Hemingway only wrote short stories of his Chicago-arearoots, Buske thinks the author, who committed suicide while gravelyill in 1961, actually was deeply influenced by the suburb's moralityand hard-work ethic.   ``He didn't feel right when he wasn't following Oak Parktraditions. Let's take sexual morality. He married the girls he wentwith. He wasn't content just to sleep with them.   ``The motto of Oak Park High School _ which he attended _ is`Nothing but the best,' and that is what Ernest sought. He wasalways comparing himself with other writers to show that he was theworld champion writer.''</TEXT></DOC>
