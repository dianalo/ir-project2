The plan, a key part of the 86-page platform of President LeslieManigat's National Democratic Progressive Rally, also wouldseparate the police from the armed forces and put them undercivilian control.   ``There is a perception the army was ... corrupted by theDuvalier dictatorship,'' the party document says. ``But there isanother truth, also incontestable, that the army was the victim ofthe Duvalier dictatorship, which humiliated, dismantled anddecapitated it.''   ``There must be a ... rehabilitation to wipe out the image thatthe army is a repressive force against the civilian population.''   Manigat as a candidate and now president has acted as a bufferbetween the army and its harshest critics. He claims he can controlthe institution that has dominated politics in this impoverishedCaribbean country of 6 million people from the time Haiti wonindependence from France in 1804.   Following the end of the 19-year U.S. occupation in 1934, thearmy put Dumarsais Estime in as president in 1946, took poweritself in 1950 under Col. Paul Magloire, and helped Francois ``PapaDoc'' Duvalier win a disputed election that began a brutal 29-yeardictatorship in 1957.   Duvalier set up the Tonton Macoutes militia, which came to begenerally regarded as street thugs, when the army and coast guardplotted against him. He emasculated Haiti's armed forces byshuffling, retiring and sometimes executing commanders. He basedpromotions on loyalty to him, and gave away state monopolies to hismilitary favorites.   When Duvalier's son and successor, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc''Duvalier, fled into exile in February 1986, a military-dominatedjunta led by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, then the army's chief of staff,took control and ruled by decree for two years leading up toManigat's election Jan. 17 and inauguration Feb. 7.   Opposition leaders say it remains to be seen whether the armywill return to the barracks as Namphy, now the commander in chief,had pledged before the election, and whether Manigat has the powerto reorganize or dismantle an entrenched military hierarchy.   A Western diplomat who closely tracks political and militarydevelopments here said in an interview: ``All those who madeofficer between 1959 and 1971 were Duvalier appointees of very lowquality. ... The officers who graduated in 1973 (two years after``Baby Doc'' reopened the Haitian Military Academy) ... see thingsdifferently. They're more progressive, they're more educated,they're more professional.   ``But they're blocked by the system, they're blocked by theDuvalier appointees above them _ the colonels, the generals _ whoare not leaving,'' said the diplomat, speaking only on condition ofanonymity.   The military also has been linked to drug trafficking and to thesmuggling of cars, rice, sugar and other goods.   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration opened an office inPort-au-Prince in November because cocaine smuggling was rising sorapidly in Haiti. A DEA informant, Osvaldo Quintana, testified infederal court in Miami, Fla., in January that the trafficking wastaking place under the protection of Haitian soldiers.   Armed Forces of Haiti officials rarely respond to such criticismor charges. The military is a closed, secretive organization.   All interviews have to be cleared with Brig. Gen. Carl MichelNicolas, who is Namphy's successor as chief of staff. Nicolas didnot respond to a written request for an interview with TheAssociated Press.   The present-day army structure was established by U.S. Marinesin 1916 to help put down a guerrilla-style insurrection. It is themain component of the armed forces, which also include the police,coast guard, fire department, a presidential guard and severalother battalions and departmental commands.   The armed forces' main role is to protect the president andmaintain security _ a difficult task given their small numbers andinadequate equipment and training. The fire department isnotoriously slow, and residents who have been robbed have to sendtheir own cars to pick up police investigators.   Military recruits, drawn from the lower middle class, are paidthe equivalent of $160 a month on a pay scale that ranges up to$1,800 for colonels and $3,400 for Namphy, the top commander.   Enlistment terms run for six years and the military isconsidered a good career in a country where more than half thepopulation cannot find steady work and the annual per capita incomeis about $350.   Training is limited, and equipment consists mostly of aginghand-me-downs from the United States _ M-1 rifles and M-14automatic weapons, a half-dozen helicopters of which only two orthree work, a few armored personnel carriers and some cutters thatpatrol the coast.   For 7,000 men, fewer than a single U.S. Army division, there arefive generals and 24 colonels.   While Namphy is the commander in chief, the 500-man battalion atthe Dessalines Barracks acts semi-autonomously under Col.Jean-Claude Paul.   The Dessalines battalion was involved in almost every incidentlast summer when soldiers shot and killed unarmed anti-governmentdemonstators.   The green-uniformed, black-booted battalion, which patrolsstreets in this sprawling capital of 1 million, was noticeablyabsent Nov. 29, however, when gunmen with hand grenades andautomatic weapons killed at least 34 people and forced thecancellation of what would have been Haiti's first free, open andindependently run presidential election in 30 years.   ``It is the only unit that is really feared here,'' the Westerndiplomat said, noting that some of the Duvaliers' Tonton Macouteswere incorporated into it. ``The men are very loyal to (Col. Paul).He ignores the chain of command and commands them directly.''   Nevertheless, the diplomat said he was optimistic that Manigatmight succeed in his efforts to educate and modernize the armedforces, and reorient soldiers to accept civilian rule andparticipate in national development.   ``The young officers aspire for change and they see it coming,''the diplomat said. ``The problem remaining is the DessalinesBarracks. We're waiting to see what Manigat will do about that.   ``In the next five years, we'll see a new generation of officerswith diplomas who have traveled abroad, who are of a differentmentality, who are young and cultured. They can give a new image tothe army.''   A leading Haitian academic who has had a 30-year acquaintancewith Manigat said he is not sure that will happen.   Speaking only on the condition that he remain anonymous, fearingrecrimination, he said: ``The army wants to leave the civilianstructures of power, not power itself. There's too much money to bemade.   ``Manigat is no puppet. Far from it. It is an extremelyinteresting battle. He makes the army believe he supports it. Thearmy makes him believe they support him. Each one knows the otheris lying. ...   ``In the final analysis, Manigat is not capable of dominatingthe army or manipulating power. Haiti's immediate future is goingto be as tragic as its present and its past. I fear uprisings amongthe people.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 21</NOTE></DOC>
