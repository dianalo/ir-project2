To model the system, the dynamic equations of a magneticallysuspended flywheel are derived. Next, the four control systems controllingthe four degrees of freedom of the stack are incorporated into the model.The resulting dynamic equations are represented as first order differentialequations in a matrix form. A computer simulation program was then usedto simulate the working of the magnetic bearing stack. Real time plotsfrom the simulation are used to show the effect of dynamic coupling ontorque response. Frequency response is used to determine the resonancefrequencies of the stack system. It is found that system stability dependson flywheel speed. On the basis of the above results suggestions aremade to improve stability and allow the stack to be spun beyond 60,000rpm.</TEXT></DOC>
