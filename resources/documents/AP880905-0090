A lawsuit filed by Paul DiMatteo, former GTE general manager forCentral America, also claims his supervisors forced him to engagein illegal financial practices designed to drain capital fromNicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.   He alleges he was fired unfairly by General Telephone andamp;Electronics, based in Stamford, Conn., when he refused.   The lawsuit is set for trial Sept. 13 before U.S. District JudgeEarl Gilliam, who last month denied GTE attorney's request that thecase be dismissed.   GTE officials have declined to discuss the matter but issued abrief statement denying DiMatteo's allegations.   According to the statement, the 10-year GTE veteran was firedfor failing to ``perform satisfactorily as a general manager.'' Hewas never encouraged to engage in illegal activities during histhree-year term as general manager of the company's electricproducts subsidiaries in Central America, it said.   ``Mr. DiMatteo's suit is totally without merit and we'reconfident that GTE will be completely exonerated in this matter,''the statement said.   DiMatteo, 57, who now owns a small manufacturing business innorthern San Diego County, denied he was fired for poorperformance. Neither he nor his lawyers would discuss the casefurther.   In court documents, his lawyers have indicated that they intendto bring up during the trial similar allegations made against GTEin the past.   According to the documents, Odalier Villalobos, Costa Rica'svice minister and later minister of the economy from 1983 through1986, was involved in the bribery scheme.   GTE, through the consulting firm Consultoria E. InversionesLtda., paid Villalobos the equivalent of $400 to $500 a monthbeginning in 1983 so he would prevent a competitor from sellingproducts in Costa Rica, DiMatteo said in a deposition.   Villalobos suggested the payments, and they were approved byFrederick Howard, DiMatteo's superior in Danvers, Mass.,headquarters of GTE's precision materials and Sylvania lightinggroups, the lawsuit said.   Howard, who eventually fired DiMatteo, did not return atelephone call to his office in Williamsport, Pa., where he is nowvice president and general manager of GTE's electrical componentsand materials division.   Villalobos could not be reached in Costa Rica for comment.   DiMatteo claims his only interference with the payments was toset the monthly limit and to insist the consulting company find away to make the payments appear legal in the company's books.   He says he objected, however, when the company sought toexchange in U.S. dollars instead of local currencies and encouragedillegal methods if legal ones were unavailable.   To obtain this objective, DiMatteo says his superiors turned tothe black market, smuggling and other illegal methods, according toa disposition.   An audit of GTE by Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. accounting firm in 1983noted that the company had exchanged in the currency black marketin Nicaragua and warned the company against continuing thepractice, according to court documents.   In 1977, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged that GTEpaid as much as $14 million in bribes and kickbacks in 28countries, including Iran, the Philippines and the United States.   GTE neither admitted nor denied the allegations, but consentedto a permanent injunction, agreeing to refrain from any futureviolations.</TEXT></DOC>
