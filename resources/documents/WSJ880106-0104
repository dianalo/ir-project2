To Post Rise in Profit For Fiscal 3rd Quarter </HL><SO> </SO><CO> HELE </CO><IN> CEO </IN><DATELINE> EL PASO, Texas  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Helen of Troy Corp. said it expects to report fiscal third-quarter earnings rose to $2.2 million, or between 60 cents and 65 cents a share.    In the year-earlier quarter Helen of Troy, a designer, developer and marketer of hair-care appliances, reported net income of $1.7 million, or 51 cents a share.    Sales for the third quarter, which ended Nov. 30, climbed about 28% to $23 million from $18 million.    Sales are continuing strong in the fiscal fourth quarter, the company said. It estimates fiscal 1988 net will total $4.6 million, or $1.35 to $1.40 cents a share, on $64 million to $66 million in sales. In fiscal 1987, the company earned $4.3 million, or $1.29 a share, including an extraordinary gain of $782,000, on sales of $52.2 million.    &quot;I know there has been a concern about the market crash and retail sales,&quot; said Gerald J. Rubin, chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;But ours were up 50% in December over last year, and we think after-Christmas sales look strong too.&quot;    Helen of Troy's chief business stems from being North American licensee for the Vidal Sassoon trademark on its line of appliances and accessories. The licensing agreement is with the Richardson-Vicks division of Procter andamp; Gamble Co. The royalty Helen of Troy pays Procter andamp; Gamble was reduced 50% last year, saving the company $1.2 million after taxes, Mr. Rubin said. Helen of Troy has the right to extend the license through 2012.    Marketing the Vidal Sassoon products to retailers and catalog showrooms accounts for about 80% of its business. Helen of Troy also sells its own line of professional hair-care appliances to salons, about 10% of its sales.    Mr. Rubins said the company anticipates sales of $80 million in the next fiscal year, &quot;and we anticipate further growth down the road.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
