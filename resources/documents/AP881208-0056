KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Worldwide acceptance of basic human rightsstandards has loosened the grip of a ``KGB mentality'' in the SovietUnion and made totalitarian terror unacceptably costly to most worldleaders, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said today.   Whitehead, commenting at State Department ceremonies marking the40th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights, said there has been significant human rights progressnot only in the Soviet Union but in such Eastern European nations asPoland and Hungary.   ``Thousands have been allowed to emigrate, hundreds of politicalprisoners have been freed, and we have seen some loosening ofcontrols on religious worship,'' Whitehead said.   He also said ``state security'' has become less a subject forofficial paranoia.   ``Open discussion of important issues has become more widespreadthroughout the Soviet Union,'' Whitehead said. ``I say, let itcontinue and grow.''   But he said there has been no forward movement on human rights inCzechoslovakia, Bulgaria or East Germany and said that in Romania,``we are witnessing a regression.''   Whitehead also complained that in the Soviet Union, ``millions ofEastern Rite Catholics remain unable to practice their religionofficially.''   ``Much change will have to occur before we can say that theaverage Soviet citizen no longer fears his government, that the ruleof law has been established and that the arbitrary use of power bySoviet officialdom has ended,'' Whitehead said.   ``Still, who would have thought eight years ago that the SovietUnion would be so changed,'' he said.   ``Leadership changes in the Soviet Union brought a loosening ofthe grip of what I would call the KGB mentality,'' Whitehead said.``Many of the leaders of the Soviet Union began to take a morepractical view of the world.''   He said there are a number of reasons for these developments. Oneis the fact that ``the growth of acceptance for universal standardsof civil and political rights has today made that old standby,totalitarian terror and oppression, unacceptably costly in the eyesof most leaders.''   Whitehead said the United States can't claim credit for thechanges taking place inside the Soviet Union, ``but we can claimcredit for having capitalized on the opening we found, and pushedhard to accelerate the rate of change.''   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by theUnited Nations on Dec. 10, 1948. The actual 40th anniversary fallson Saturday but is being commemorated in the United States today.   The declaration contains many of the civil rights laid out in thefirst 10 amendments to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.   It also includes the right to leave and return to the country ofone's origin, and the right to send and receive information from anysource across international borders.   It also calls for a limit to the power of a government to coerceindividual citizens against their will and such affirmative rightsas the right to an education, the right to work at the occupation ofone's choosing and the right to own property.</TEXT></DOC>
