One of the main beneficiaries may be the natural gas industry. Itis heavily promoting the idea of running cars on compressed naturalgas, which emits less of some pollutants than vehicles burninggasoline or diesel fuel.   Natural gas also is a raw material for methanol, the Bushadministration's favored choice for an alternative to gasoline. Oilcompanies, however, are critical of the methanol move, which theysay presents many cost and safety problems.   Yet another alternative fuel is ethanol, made from fermented cornand agricultural wastes. It is limited in supply and more expensivethan methanol or gasoline.   Bush was seeking to drum up public support for alternative fuelsTuesday with appearances in Nebraska, a big corn producer that lastyear used more ethanol-based fuel, as a share of its total vehiclefuels market, than any other state.   The aim of the Bush proposal, announced Monday as part of abroader environmental package, is to reduce vehicles' contributionto air pollution. But it also would mean higher prices forconsumers, if gasoline is gradually eliminated, analysts said.   Gasoline emits nitrous oxides that are an ingredient in the ozonethat causes smog.   A key element of the Bush plan is a phased-in requirement forauto manufacturers to produce alternatives to gasoline-powered autosin the nine major urban areas with the worst smog problems.   Half a million such cars would have to be available by 1995, and1 million would have to be produced each year from 1997 through2004. The urban areas are Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Milwaukee,Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Diego, Chicago and ``greaterConnecticut.''   ``It'll be a big boost'' for alternative fuel use, said ScottDenman, director of the Safe Energy Communication Council, anenvironmental group that favors reducing use of fossil fuels, mainlyby improving energy and vehicle efficiency.   The technology exists to produce cars capable of running onalternative fuels. The auto companies have hesitated to undertakefull-scale production because of a concern that the fuels are notyet widely available, while the oil companies balk at producinglarge quantities of the fuels until the vehicles win consumeracceptance.   William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAgency, told reporters the auto and oil industries must find a wayof resolving this stalemate.   ``The point of this program...is to make sure that we solve thechicken-and-egg problem, that we have the fuel available to servicethe cars and the cars available to use the fuel,'' he said, addingthat industry must ``ensure that that happens.''   The oil industry strongly criticized the alternative fuelsportion of Bush's proposal, which will be sent to Capitol Hill incoming weeks. The industry wants a pilot program, at least partlyfinanced by the government, to work out the technical and economickinks before commercial-scale production is required.   ``We are disappointed by the administration's apparent preferencefor mandating alternate-fuel vehicles, an extremely costly andinflexible step which would provide highly uncertain environmentalbenefits and presumably require...higher prices for all fuels,''said the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's mainlobbying group.   The oil companies, which sell about 100 billion gallons ofgasoline a year, are quick to point out the drawbacks to alternativefuels. Methanol, for example, emits less carbon monoxide thangasoline but produces formaldehyde and other harmful poisons.   Methanol is highly corrosive, so a car's fuel tank and the entirefuel-delivery system must be made of a corrosion-resistant materialsuch as stainless steel.   Engines running on compressed natural gas produce almost no sootand less carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides and hydrocarbons thangasoline engines do. But some experts worry that greatly increaseduse of natural gas would deplete the existing surpluses and couldlead to greater reliance on Middle Eastern energy suppliers.</TEXT></DOC>
