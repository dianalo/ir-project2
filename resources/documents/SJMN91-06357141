Not only don't your neighbors complainwhen you drape your house with enough lights to suit a midsize Las Vegascasino, they actually come over and tell you how pretty it is.;   Even thesedate Fairmont can light itself up like a Christmas tree without fear ofrebuke. Its silhouette is outlined again this year in white fairy lights. Thesame lights sprinkle down on the Pavilion's awnings next door and ontree-lined streets across the valley. This year running lights are bigger thanever. Blinking on and off to give the illusion of animation, they have more todo with box-office glitz than Bethlehem.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE LAS VEGAS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Architecture; Alan Hess is a Bay Area architect whose column appears everyother week in Perspective.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Make no mistake. Tinsel is no passing holiday fancy. Underlying all thosefairy lights is a streak of popular taste that loves civic gaudiness, thatbinges on glitter, that craves to live in fantasies of elves and reindeer andsnow in San Jose. Why? Because we're starved for it the rest of the year inthe blandscape we live in.;   The folk artist hidden inside your neighbor theaccountant comes out of the closet once a year. From the garage he and hisreluctant kids drag flimsy elves, gargantuan candy canes, particleboardreindeer. It's the flimsiest stuff, yet it creates -- especially at night -- areal land of wonder.;   January through November we have to suppress thislove. We have to pretend that we actually like understated elegance, polishedbrown granite on our offices, unobtrusive non- neon signs on our roadsides,tile roofs on our Burger Kings.;   But come Thanksgiving and the interiordecorator in everyone comes out. Admit it, those illuminated candy canes inyour front yard and the rainbow-colored light bulbs blinking like a movie-landpremiere have nothing to do with any religious convictions. Admit it, theyhave everything to do with aesthetic convictions. This is the way we want ourcities to look all the time.;   Every plastic Frosty the Snowman is a vote forimaginativeness in urban design. The average person has no say in how a newbusiness park should look, or the style of the new corner gas station. But atChristmas people take city design into their own hands. They can alter the waytheir neighborhood looks. It's a grass-roots movement if ever there was one.Every planning commission in the county ought to pay attention to Christmasdecorations.;   It shows what's missing the rest of the year: color,animation, ornament, memories and traditions, and especially stories.Christmas gives everyone the license to tell their favorite stories right ontheir front lawns. You've seen the neighbor's house with the reindeer on theroof and the bag of toys disappearing down the chimney -- they're telling &quot;TheNight Before Christmas&quot; in Spielbergian detail. Those pious scenes of Mary,Joseph, Jesus and assorted donkeys and angels are straight from the Bible.Wherever you see the malls decked with boughs of holly someone's trying toconjure up the Ghost of Christmas Past. Dickensian carolers, Frosties theSnowmen, the menorah all have familiar tales to tell. They add a narrativerichness to the streets that isn't usually there. They show our hunger for anenvironment that means something. We desire something to engage ourimaginations.;   Christmastime is the proof that, given our druthers, we'd allreally rather live in Las Vegas.;   Yes, Las Vegas. It's heresy but it's true.It's the only town in the United States that doesn't care about good taste,and we flock there with our videocams and Instamatics to enjoy it. It is anentire city of flashing lights and storytelling all year 'round.;   Las Vegasis storytelling architecture par excellence. The tales there reach beyond thewinter wonderlands and flying sleighs of the Christmas landscape. Itsfantasies include Ivanhoe's medieval castles, Captain Bligh's South Seasislands, Julius Caesar's imperial grandeur, John Wayne's Old West -- theclassic images of movies and literature. They add a distinct dimension to theexperience of the city. That's why we like Christmas lights. For a few weeks,even the Fairmont can forget propriety and become something a kid could love.;  There are modest examples of this in San Jose. The Pavilion offers some ofthe atmosphere of a downtown of memory with its sidewalk display windows, itsclassic proportions, its arcades, its plazas. The Rosicrucian Museum offers adimension of Egyptian mystery with an economy of means: a few gardens, a bitof papyrus-leaved ornament and a couple of sphinxes. Older buildings like theArt Museum's original wing bring the ambience of our own past. When completed,the Guadalupe River Parkway winding through downtown will return a bit ofmemory of the native landscape before white people arrived on its shores. Themurals of Hispanic San Jose remind us of a history close in time and space.;  So strip away all the phony tinsel and you'll find the real tinsel underneath.A city needs some surprise and fantasy. It needs stories, color, animation andglitter. Unleash it and we'll get a lot more than plastic sleighs. These arethe pleasures of Christmastime. But we don't have to feel guilty about themanymore.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Alan Hess column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911222  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1P  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  875  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 22, 199100357141,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
