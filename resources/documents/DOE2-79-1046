<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-79-1046 </DOCNO><TEXT>Arguments for an early divergence of archaebacterial genomic lineagesfrom eubacterial genomic lineages, and of either from that genomic lineagenow resident within eukaryotic nuclei, are many and compelling. We maynever be able to decide (1) whether archaebacterial and eukaryotic nucleargenomic lineages share a common ancestor more recent than that whicheither shares with eubacterial genomic lineages, (2) whether all divergencesare so ancient as to preclude construction of an experimentally verifiablecladogram for these three &quot;primary kingdoms,&quot; or (3) whether frequentgenetic exchanges early in the divergence of these kingdoms render questionsof branching order meaningless. We can, nevertheless, be sure that manyof the features that now distinguish eubacterial, eukaryotic nuclear,and archaebacterial lineages represent independently achieved solutionsto evolutionary problems as yet unsolved by their common &quot;progenotic&quot;ancestor. Many of these distinguishing features involve the structureand function of the machineries of transcription and translation, andmay be interpreted to mean that this progenotic ancestor was, at thetime of the divergence of the primary kingdoms, still under strong selectionpressure to increase the accuracy and speed with which hereditary informationis transferred from gene to protein.</TEXT></DOC>
