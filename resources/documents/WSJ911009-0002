Yesterday's decision to take a more liberal approachtoward assistance followed an offer on Monday by the EuropeanCommunity to extend an additional $1.54 billion in aid to theSoviets for food and medical supplies, as long as otherindustrialized countries made similar efforts. The ECchallenged the countries to put together a $7 billionemergency-aid package and agreed to supply one-third of it.</LP><TEXT>   But a Japanese Foreign Ministry official, who asked not tobe identified, stressed that it was purely &quot;by chance&quot; thatJapan's announcement followed the EC's so closely.   The amount of the aid earmarked for food and medicine inthe Japanese package is $500 million -- a figure that appearsto be lower than what the EC expected. The $500 million willtake the form of credit from Japan's Export-Import Bank,although details are still to be worked out.   The Japanese program also includes trade insurance of $1.8billion and $200 million of credit from Japan's Export-ImportBank in order to promote trade between Japan and the SovietUnion.   According to the Foreign Ministry official, the assistancewas worked out in accordance with a report by a governmentfact-finding mission that recently returned from the SovietFar East. He added that the Japanese government hasn't heardanything official from Brussels concerning the EC's packageyet. The $1.54 billion EC offer is in addition to an earlierEC pledge of nearly $1 billion for food and technicalassistance.   In the past, Japan has extended only minimal economicassistance to the Soviets, in part because of a longstandingterritorial dispute over four Pacific islands claimed byJapan and controlled by the Soviet Union since World War II.Also, Japan wasn't fully convinced that Moscow was movingtoward a market economy.   Late last year, Japan agreed to provide humanitarian aidin the form of a credit extension, but the amount promisedthen was only $100 million.   The Foreign Ministry official said the aid represents anexpression of Japan's appreciation for change in the SovietUnion and shouldn't be linked with the islands dispute.   In a separate statement issued earlier yesterday, theJapanese government said that since the coup, &quot;the Sovietsituation has changed drastically and it has become possible{for Japan} to expect substantial reform towarddemocratization and a market-oriented economy.&quot;   The Foreign Ministry official said the $1.8 billion ofexport insurance is designed to have a &quot;psychological effect&quot;on trade between the two countries. Reflecting Moscow'seconomic chaos, Japan's exports to the Soviet Union declinedabout 20% in the first six months of this year from a yearearlier.</TEXT></DOC>
