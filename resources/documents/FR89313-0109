(``TRW'') in this civil antitrust proceeding.I. IntroductionThis action began on November 17, 1988, when the United States filed acomplaint alleging that the proposed acquisition of Chilton Corporation(``Chilton'') by TRW would violate section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.18. The Complaint alleged that the effect of the acquisition would be substantiallyto lessen competition in sales of consumer credit reports in sixteen (16)geographic markets. Both companies sell credit reports, either directlythrough credit bureau offices that they own (``owned offices'') or indirectlythrough affiliated credit bureaus, in each of these markets. The Complaintseeks, among other relief, to enjoin the transaction to prevent its anticompetitiveeffects in the sixteen relevant markets.On November 17, 1988, the United States and TRW filed a Stipulation inwhich they consented to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment designedto eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the acquisition. In accordancewith the provisions of the APPA, the United States also filed a CompetitiveImpact Statement explaining the basis for the Complaint and for the UnitedStates' conclusion that entry of the proposed Final Judgment would be inthe public interest. The proposed Final Judgment eliminated the anticompetitiveeffects alleged in the Complaint with respect to the sixteen markets byrequiring TRW to consummate contracts to sell copies of the consumer creditfiles in some markets and to end affiliation agreements with independentcredit bureaus in others.The United States and TRW stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment maybe entered after compliance with the APPA, unless the government withdrawsits consent. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment would terminate thisaction, except that the Court would retain jurisdiction to construe, modify,and enforce the Final Judgment and to punish violations of the Judgment.II.

(CCH) andpara; 62,861 at page78,988 (E.D. Mo. 1979).<ITAG tagnum="81">F. The Competitive Analysis of the United States </ITAG>The Department believes that if the proposed Final Judgment is entered,the transaction will no longer violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Theproposed Final Judgment will ensure that a new vendor will enter each marketin which, absent such relief, the transaction would substantially reducecompetition. As a result, credit grantors will have as many potential sourcesof full file consumer credit reports to choose from as in the past andno credit report seller will be able to gain market power. Thus, the UnitedStates concludes that entry of the proposed Final Judgment is in the publicinterest. 1. <T3>The Product Is ``Full File'' Consumer Credit Reports. </T3>Consumercredit reports are purchased by grantors of credit such as banks, mortgagecompanies, department stores, and other businesses to determine whetherto grant credit to individual consumers. Credit reports include informationon a person's background,\12\<NOTE/> debts owed,\13\<NOTE/> and public record announcements.\14\<NOTE/> Debt obligation information is obtained from computer tapescredit grantors prepare each month on the status of their consumer accounts.Public record information is collected manually from public records bylocal credit bureaus.\15\<NOTE/> A data base of credit reports that contains all the typesof information demanded by credit grantors, including five years of historicalinformation, is considered a ``full file.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ This normally includes the consumer's name, any aliases,age, marital status, number of dependents, social security number, currentand two most recent previous addresses, current and two most recent employersand current salary. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Information about debts owed is gathered from individual,regional, and local credit grantors who are willing to give copies of theircomputerized records to credit bureaus. The data shows a consumer's outstandingcredit accounts, credit balance, current balance, whether any amount ispast due, and, if so, for how long. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ This includes judgments, liens, and bankruptcy informationobtained from the records of federal, state, county or municipal authorities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ In some states, public record information may be purchasedfrom public record information collection firms.Credit grantors purchase credit reports to reduce the risk of grantingcredit to consumers with whom they are unfamiliar. Obviously, the moreinformation in a credit report, the lower the risk. Those who purchasecredit reports generally believe that a four or five year credit historyis necessary for prudent risk assessment. As a result, credit grantorsdo not consider credit reports that contain less than four or five yearsof debt obligation information and less than seven years of public recordinformation to be adequate substitutes for reports that contain such information.\16\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ Bureaus sometimes sell credit reports while they arein the process of collecting information. Credit reports that are not fullfiles usually sell for substantially less than full files. 2. <T3>The Geographic Market for Consumer Credit Report is Local. </T3>Thegeographic market for credit reports is local because credit grantors demandas much current credit information as they can get about an individual,and the only vendors likely to possess that information are those creditbureaus in the area in which the individual resides. A credit grantor wouldnot consider a credit bureau that does not have full file information onmost individuals in a particular geographic area to be an adequate substitutefor a credit bureau that possessed such comprehensive local information.If distant credit bureaus were fully competitive substitutes for localcredit bureaus, there would be no variations in local prices based uponthe number of local bureaus. In fact, however, prices in particular geographicareas vary widely, depending on the number of credit bureaus offering fullfile credit reports in that area. That evidence strongly suggests the conclusionthat credit bureaus doing business elsewhere are not in the market. 3. <T3>The Structure of the Modern Consumer Credit Reporting Business. </T3>Theconsumer credit reporting business has changed dramatically in the lasttwenty years as independent local merchant-owned credit bureaus have beentransformed into parts of national computerized networks of consumer creditinformation. Most credit bureaus were founded by regional or municipalmerchants associations. Originally, those bureaus collected informationmanually. The labor-intensive nature of the business, as well as the factthat most bureaus were owned by their customers, led to a situation wheremost local bureaus were monopolies. The business changed radically in thelate 1960s and early 1970s when five companies (hereinafter referred toas ``networks'' or ``network vendors'') (TRW, Chilton, CBI, Trans Union,and ACS) began to store consumer credit files on computers.\17\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ There are now four networks. In the comments, the numberof vendors is sometimes set at five and sometimes at four. This is a resultof the fact that one of the companies that has been providing data processingservices, Associated Credit Services, Inc. (``ACS''), is discontinuingits data processing and network activities. On August 1, 1988, ACS enteredinto an agreement to obtain computer services from The Credit Bureau, Incorporatedof Georgia (``CBI''). After ACS discontinues its data processing activities,there will be four vendors of such services: TRW, Chilton, CBI, and TransUnion Credit Information Co. (``Trans Union''). Computers greatly reduced the cost of maintaining consumer credit filesand allowed firms to enter markets that had previously been monopolizedby one firm. Computers also enabled credit bureaus to form regional networksthat share information on individual consumers. These networks are of greatbenefit to credit grantors contemplating extending credit to consumersthat reside in other parts of the country or that have recently moved.\1\\8\<NOTE/> The increased mobility of many Americans makes it very importantthat credit grantors be able to obtain information about an individual'scredit history throughout the country. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ When an individual moves from one area to another,the information on that individual is transferred from the file of thecredit bureau of his former residence to the file of the credit bureauat his new one within the data base. Thus, while credit bureaus once operated as individual entities, they arenow pieces of an interlocking network of independent bureaus, known asaffiliates, and vendor-owned offices that collect, maintain, and distributeconsumer credit information over a large geographic area. Affiliates andowned offices all store their information in a vendor maintained commondata base and all of them have access to all the information in the database. A vendor provides credit bureaus with data processing services andaccess to all the information in its data base. Affiliates provide vendorswith all their data and sell that data to other affiliates and to the vendor(for use in its owned offices). Affiliates in a network are more partners in the creation, maintenance,and sale of consumer credit data bases than mere customers of data processingservices. Indeed, all affiliates and owned offices in a network are usuallyknown to credit grantors by the vendor's tradename, rather than the affiliate's.As a result, affiliates have a big stake in the success or failure of theirnetwork vendors. Similarly, vendors rely heavily on the data collectionand sales abilities of their affiliates. In recent years, the importance to credit grantors of a credit bureau'sability to provide information on consumers in other parts of the countryhas led TRW, Trans Union, and CBI all to announce that they intend to havefiles on consumers all over the country. These vendors have opened newcredit bureau offices or entered into contracts with independent affiliatesin many towns previously served by a single, monopoly credit bureau. Indeed,TRW will substantially expand its geographic scope through the acquisitionof Chilton. Thus, while the Department concluded that the transaction poseda danger to competition in sixteen local markets, it also recognized thatthe transaction created the potential for improved consumer credit databases and thus could be of benefit to credit grantors in many local markets.In spite of the great incentive for vendors to enter new local markets,development into a full fledged competitor from scratch is a lengthy processthat cannot be accomplished in less than three to five years. The principlereason entry takes so long is that a full file must contain substantiallythe same information as an established firm, <T3>i.e.,</T3> four to five years of debt obligation and seven years ofpublic record information, to be an adequate substitute for credit grantors.Since credit grantors usually save their debt obligation information forapproximately one year, it takes several years to collect sufficient debtinformation data for a full file. Similarly, the collection of public recordinformation is normally a slow process that takes at least two years. <T3>4. The Effect of the Transaction.</T3> TRW and Chilton sell creditreports in many parts of the United States. There are, however, relativelyfew areas in which both firms sell full file consumer credit reports. TheDepartment found that, in most of the United States, TRW and Chilton donot compete against one another.\1\\9\<NOTE/> Historically, TRW's strength has been on the east and westcoasts while Chilton's strength has been in the midwest. The TRW and Chiltonnetworks are direct competitors in sixteen markets where there are fewalternative sources of credit reports. In all of those markets, the HHI,\2\\0\<NOTE/> measured by units sold, before the acquisition, exceeded3200 and the acquisition would cause the HHI to increase by more than 700points.\2\\1\<NOTE/> The high level of concentration in those makets, combinedwith the difficulty of entry into local markets, led the Department toconclude that the acquisition would enable TRW to gain market power, <T3>i.e., </T3>the power to control price over a substantial period oftime, in those markets. Each of these sixteen areas is now served by theTRW and Chilton networks and, at most, one other network. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ TRW has consumer information in all 32 states in whichChilton does business. However, both companies have full files in all ofor portions of 11 of those states. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ ``HHI'' means the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index, a measureof market concentration calculated by squaring the market share of eachfirm competing in the market and then summing the resulting numbers. Forexample, for a market consisting of four firms with shares of 30, 30, 20,and 20 percent, the HHI is 2,600 (302 + 302 + 202 + 202 = 900 + 900 + 400+ 400 = 2,600). The HHI takes into account the relative size and distributionof the firms in a market. It approaches zero when a market is occupiedby a large number of firms of relative equal size and reaches its maximumof 10,000 when a market is controlled by a single firm. The HHI increasesboth as the number of firms in the market decreases and as the disparityin size between those firms increases. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ Hawaii offers its own HHI calculation and concludesthat the Department has understated the extent to which the concentrationis likely to increase in its state, and presumably, the extent to whichcompetition there will be reduced. The Department provided a range of HHIincreases in the affected makets, rather than specific market shares andHHI calcualtions, in order to avoid revealing commerically sensitive information.We believe we adequately established the likelihood of competitive harmthrough less precise information on concentration. We agree with Hawaiithat the threat to competition is substantial. However, the exact HHI isirrelevant to the question of whether the remedial action set out in theproposed Final Judgment will be effective.  5. <T3>The Proposed Final Judgment. </T3>Under the terms of the Proposed FinalJudgment, TRW was required to take corrective action in each of the sixteenaffected markets. TRW would be required either to end its relationshipwith an affiliate in a market, thereby making the former affiliate availablefor a network vendor not yet in the market with a full file, or to sella copy of its data base to another vendor which would compete in the market.The Department concluded that either action would end any threat to competitionposed by the acquisition. While we recognized that neither solution wouldleave any market unchanged, we concluded that either eventually would preventTRW from maintaining market power in any market.A firm cannot gain market power when there is either a sufficient numberof competitors or it is likely that new firms would enter the market inresponse to a small, but significant, nontransitory price increase. Thetwo forms of relief employed by the proposed Final Judgment will preventTRW from exercising market power either by keeping the number of competitorsunchanged (by enabling a network not in the market to team up with theformer TRW (or Chilton) affiliate) or my making available to an outsidevendor a full file of local credit information, the creation of which isthe major barrier to entry into local markets. (See page 14, <T3>supra.</T3>) Indeed, the Department's predictions that the proposedrelief would result in new entry into these markets has been borne outin fact; companies have already committed themselves to enter those marketsthrough the purchase of copies of data files.The proposed Final Judgment involves minimal governmental intrusion intothe market and permits credit grantors, the consumers affected by thismerger, to obtain the benefits of increased national coverge of the TRWdata base. The increased coverage increases the likelihood that the database will have information on an individual who has recently moved. Furthermore,local files will improve in areas where both TRW and Chilton have beendeveloping files, but do not yet have fully mature data bases.\2\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ As we explain below, to enjoin the transaction completelywould deny credit grantors the benefits they expect to gain from the transaction.The Department also concluded that the proposed Final Judgment would bethe least instrusive means of correcting the competiitive problems posedby the transaction. We were aware that the proposed Final Judgment wouldaffect the interests of the affiliates with whom TRW had agreed not toreaffiliate. However, all consent decrees and, indeed, all mergers affectthe interests of third parties. It is quite likely that, even in the absenceof the proposed Final Judgment, some, or all, of those affiliates wouldhave been unable to preserve their relationships with TRW. After many mergers,firms end relationships with duplicate suppliers or distributors. Similarly,after consummation of its acquisition of Chilton, TRW would have been likelyto end its relationship with affiliates where there were overlapping territories.In any event, the courts repeatedly have recognized that the purpose ofthe antitrust laws is to protect competition rather than competitors. Preservationof the former, not the latter, was Congress' intent.\2\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>Brunswick Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., </T3>429 U.S. 477, 488, 97 S. Ct. 690, 697(1977).<ITAG tagnum="81">G. Response to Comments</ITAG>With the exception of Senator Humphrey, each of the commenters is an independentcredit bureau that is currently affiliated with Chilton or TRW. While thevarious comments raise a number of concerns and objections to the proposedFinal Judgment, they uniformly, with the exception of that of CCRC, reflectthe desire of independent credit bureaus to be allowed to renew their contractswith their current vendor. However, each of the commenters appears to acknowledgethat the proposed acquisition of Chilton by TRW would reduce competitionin the sale of credit reports in its geographic areas. Most of the commentersargue that the United States should seek to prevent the acquisition ofChilton by TRW , <T3>i.e., </T3>that the United States should not have negotiated any consentdecree at all. Some commenters argue alternatively that the decree shouldrequire TRW to sell the information that it (or Chilton) owns, in lieuof refusing to extend its (Chilton's) affiliation agreement with the commenter.\2\\4\<NOTE/> Of singular import, however, is the fact that not a singlecredit grantor, the large sophisticated consumers of credit reports, hasexpressed any concern to the Court or the Department that the proposedFinal Judgment would not adequately protect its interests.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ ``[A]t a minimum the proposed Consent Decreee shouldbe modified to allow [CBC] and similarly situated credit bureaus to continueto contract, on a fair and reasonsble basis with the successor to the Chilton/TRWoperation.'' CBC Supplementary Comments at 2. ``We object to the inclusionin the proposed final judgment of provisions that require the severanceof relationships between our clients and TRW.'' Central Massachusetts Commentsat 2.Under these circumstances, the single issue presented here is whether theproposed Final Judgment represents a reasonable exercise of the Departmentof Justice's antitrust enforcement discretion. For the reasons discussedbelow, the United States has concluded that the proposed Final Judgmentsubmitted to the Court is an appropriate resolution of this litigation.That proposed Final Judgment reflects a careful study of a complex businessand is reasonably calculated to prevent the anticompetivie effects allegedin the Complaint. Therefore, the entry of that proposed Final Judgmentis in the public interest.1. <T3>The Importance of Credit Inquiries. </T3>CBC and Rochester argue thathaving a full file, as defined by the Complaint, is insufficient for acredit bureau to compete in a given market. They suggest that credit grantorsalways purchase the credit report with more credit inquiries,\2\\5\<NOTE/> regardless of price, service, or quality considerations.\2\\6\<NOTE/> CBC and Rochester assert that unless the transaction is enjoined,TRW will enhance its share of credit inquiries, thereby gaining the powerto limit or exclude competition. These assertions are inaccurate; theyare simply inconsistent with observable trends in the industry.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ A credit inquiry is an indication that a credit grantorhas purchased a credit report on an individual. Taken together, creditinquiries reveal the extent to which the person has recently sought credit.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ CBC Comment at 5 and Rochester Comments at 2-3.The commenters, current affiliates who will have to align themselves witha new network vendor, will not be disadvantaged in terms of credit inquiryquality by the proposed Final Judgment. That Judgment would not resultin TRW increasing its share of credit inquiries in any of the commenters'markets. A credit bureau owns the data for its assigned zip codes in itsvendor's computer, including the credit inquiries, and the credit bureauis free, when its contract expires, to transfer its data to another vendor.For example, since CBC owns the New Hampshire information, Chilton cannotduplicate and retain the information for TRW's use. If a credit bureautransfers its data to another vendor, its share of credit inquiries willbe unaffected, and a purchaser of its credit reports the day after it changesaffiliations will find all the inquiries it would have found the day before.\2\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ However, TRW will have a larger share of credit inquiriesin markets where it is selling a copy of its files. Consequently, the Departmentcarefully considered the importance of credit inquiries in assessing whethersuch sales would be adequate to correct competitive problems. We concludedthat they would for the reasons discussed, <T3>infra</T3>.The commenters' claims that the credit bureau with the most credit inquirieswill always dominate a market is simply inconsistent with the existenceof two or three competitors in virtually every metropolitan area in theUnited States. If credit grantors always chose the credit report with thegreatest number of inquiries, there would only be one credit bureau inevery geographic market.\2\\8\<NOTE/> That, of course, is not the case. Rather, most geographicmarkets have two or three credit bureaus.\2\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ All credit grantors would purchase credit reports froma single source because each purchase from another provider would serveto divide the credit inquiries for that area. Of course, if CBC is seriouslysuggesting credit reporting markets are natural monopolies, it would arguethat there is <T3>no </T3>competitive problem at all, rather than that the proposed FinalJudgment is insufficient.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ CBC, therefore, substantially undermines its positionwhen it acknowledges that the number of firms competing in a particulargeographic market is usually three. CBC Comments at 4. <T3>See also, </T3>Complaint andpara;andpara; 21 through 36, setting out thenumber of competitors in various other markets. Similarly, Rochester admitsthat, under its theory, its local market should be a monopoly. Yet, inthe next paragraph it acknowledges that it essentially divides the Rochestermarket with its TRW competitor. Rochester Comments at 4-5.Furthermore, the evidence indicates that many geographic markets are becoming<T3>less </T3>concentrated as TRW, CBI, and Trans Union all enter marketsthroughout the United States. The opposite would be true if CBC and Rochesterwere correct. Entry would not be feasible because credit grantors wouldnot purchase the report of the new entrant that would have no credit inquiries.Consequently, CBC's anecdote about its efforts to enter Cleveland actuallyundermines its position.\3\\0\<NOTE/> If credit inquiries were as important as CBC claims, entryin the face of a monopolist would be foolish and futile and CBC would nothave attempted to enter the Cleveland market. Given the fact that the establishedfirm held a monopoly position in credit inquiries, CBC must have believedthat it could draw market share away from the incumbent firm (after itestablished a ``full file'') through price and service competition.\3\\1\<NOTE/> In the same vein, if CBC is correct, TRW acted irrationallyby choosing to release the dominant firm in the New Hampshire market (CBC)rather than the credit bureau with the small market share or selling acopy of the file there.\3\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ In its comments CBC indicates that it has only gaineda 10% market share since it entered the Cleveland market in 1982. CBC Commentsat 6.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\1\ CBC's experience in the Cleveland market is entirelyconsistent with the Department's position that <T3>de novo</T3> entry is difficult.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ TRW owns the New Hampshire file but leases it to anindependent credit bureau.In fact, attempts by these firms to enter new markets to challenge theincumbents, who have more credit inquiries in their files, is not folly.While credit inquiries are a factor credit grantors use to assess creditreport quality, they are not the <T3>only </T3>factor. We found that credit grantors' primary basis forselecting credit reports is whether the network has a ``full file'' (asdefined in the Complaint) fo the area in which the consumer resides. (Complaintat 6.) Selection between full file alternatives is made on the basis ofcredit inquiry information, price, readability of reports, computer downtime, brand loyalty, and other factors. And new entrants have been ableto overcome the initial credit inquiry advantage of established creditbureaus by working hard and providing quality service.2. <T3>Alternate Vendors Have Incentives to Compete. </T3>CBC, Rochester,and Hawaii also express concern that the other network vendors with whomthey may contract are inadequate to meet their needs. CBC argues that itneeds a partner that is well established in Boston because the New Hampshireand Boston markets are interrelated.\33\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ CBC is concerned about what it describes as the ``wholesalesubmarket.'' This relates to credit reports relating to individuals livingin Boston which it will sell to credit grantors in New Hampshire. In itsview, no New Hampshire credit grantor will purchase CBC's partner's reportsrelating to Boston when TRW has more credit inquiries there. In its supplementalcomments CBC indicates that this market constitutes 18 percent of its business.CBC Supplemental Comments at 8.In large measure, this argument is premised on CBC's view that the firmwith the greatest number of credit inquiries automatically possesses sustainedmarket power. For the reasons set forth above, this is not the case. Thisargument also is premised on the notion that CBI would not be an adequatereplacement network vendor for CBC because CBI does not have the incentiveor ability to compete in New England.\34\<NOTE/> All the evidence we have gathered, however, suggests otherwise.In 1987 CBI entered the Boston market by opening an office in nearby Woburn.With its purchases of Chilton's Boston file pursuant to the proposed FinalJudgment, CBI will have much the same New England coverage that Chiltonhad before the acquisition. CBI spent a substantial sum to purchase thefiles, a fact indicating its belief that the purchase of those files willgreatly facilitate its entry into those areas and provide it with a competitivefile offering. Nor is CBI a small company. It is significantly larger thanChilton, and has file coverage throughout most of the United States.\35\<NOTE/> Moreover, CBI's interest in obtaining CBC's New Hampshireoffice as an affiliate does not appear in doubt. CBC's comments indicatethat CBC's New Hampshire office will affiliate with CBI.\36\<NOTE/> If, as CBC claims, success in one market is contingent ona presence in a neighboring market, a New Hampshire affiliate should greatlyfacilitate CBI's entry into the Boston market.\37\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ CBC cannot be arguing that CBI and Trans Union are inadequatenetworks generically, <T3>i.e., </T3>wherever they do business. CBC owns offices in the statesof Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maryland, Michigan,West Virginia, and Florida. Through these various offices, it does businesswith each of the four networks.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ As a result of its agreement with ACS, CBI's file coveragewill rival, if not surpass, the combined file coverage of TRW and Chilton.By CBC's calculations, CBI and TRW will be approximately the same sizeand Trans Union somewhat smaller. CBC Supplemental Comments at 4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ CBC Comments at 8.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ CBC's comments indicate that its New Hampshire officewill join the CBI system after the acquisition. CBC Comments at 8. It isnot clear whether it already has signed a contract to this effect. In eitherevent, CBC knows which network its New Hampshire office will join.Similarly, Hawaii's assertion that it would not be able to survive competitivelywith a new network vendor is contradicted by the facts. Hawaii assertsthat it has only been able to compete with Chilton because of ``TRW's westcoast file.'' \38\<NOTE/> If it affiliates with another vendor, it claims it will haveonly its Hawaii files, whereas TRW/Chilton will have both the more matureChilton files and the strong Chilton/TRW mainland files. According to Hawaii,it will not be able to compete in these circumstances.\39\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ Hawaii Comments at 6.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ Hawaii Comments at 10.Hawaii seems to be arguing that a strong West Coast file is a prerequisiteto success in the state. But Chilton, the firm it asserts dominates Hawaii,has no file on the West Coast of any kind. In contrast, CBI and Trans Unionhave substantial files in California.\40\<NOTE/> Consequently, if access to a good West Coast file is a prerequisiteto competing in Hawaii, both CBI and Trans Union meet that requirementbetter than Chilton did for its owned office.\41\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ Both CBI and Trans Union have mature files and significantmarket shares in Los Angeles. CBI is well established in San Franciscowith a significant portion of the market and, we believe, Trans Union isdeveloping a file there.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ Hawaii is concerned that it may not be able to affiliatewith another vendor or sell a copy of its file to another vendor. HawaiiComments at 2 and 5. Its explanation for this position seems to be thatCBI and Trans Union might not have an interest. While this is possible,it seems unlikely. CBI and Trans Union have announced plans to have a nationalfile and we can think of no reason why those companies would exclude Hawaiifrom their expansion plans. Indeed, affiliation with Hawaii should be attractiveto them because it would enable them to avoid the substantial costs andextended period of information collection Hawaii acknowledges is necessaryin order to sell credit reports there. Trans Union's and CBI's purchasesof files pursuant to the proposed Final Judgment demonstrates their interestin expanding into new areas. It is also strong evidence that they havean interest in affiliating with credit bureaus whose contracts will notbe renewed under the proposed Final Judgment.Rochester's suggestion that no other network vendor would affiliate withit because of a lack of name recognition and file quality \42\<NOTE/> is difficult to comprehend. With regard to the Rochesterarea (and the Buffalo metropolitan area sixty miles to the west), the RochesterCredit Center will bring its admittedly high quality files to any networkthat it joins. Based on their announced expansion plans and their pastactions, either Trans Union or CBI would be interested in expanding theirpresence in upstate New York by affiliating with Rochester Credit Center.In Syracuse, the major metropolitan area to the east, Trans Union alreadyhas full files and CBI will gain full files as a result of its purchaseof a copy of Chilton's files.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ Rochester Comments at 4.3. <T3>The Importance of Tradenames. </T3>Rochester and Hawaii also suggestthat since they worked under the Chilton tradename in the past, creditgrantors will fail to realize that it was they, rather than Chilton, whowas responsible for their superior local credit information. Because ofthis alleged ignorance on the part of credit grantors, Rochester and Hawaiicontend that they will not prosper even if they affiliate with a new networkvendor.\4\\3\<NOTE/> This scenario of customer ignorance is highly improbable.On the local level, a credit bureau's success is primarily a function ofits own sales efforts and those of the vendor with whom it affiliates.The credit bureaus deal continuously with local credit grantors who growto know the people as well as their performance. Moreover, Rochester isa merchant-owned credit bureau. When a credit bureau is merchant-owned,it is owned and operated by its customers. In these circumstances, theidea that local credit grantors will be unaware of Rochester's change ofaffiliations is difficult to accept.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ Rochester Comments at 3-4 and Hawaii Comments at 6.The assertion of customer ignorance is equally implausible on the nationaland regional credit grantor level. Rochester's and Hawaii's argument suggeststhat credit grantors purchase credit reports on the basis of the tradenameattached rather than the quality of the information in the file. This issimply not the case. Credit grantors purchase credit reports to obtaintimely, accurate information on an individual sufficient to evaluate therisks attendant to extending him or her credit. The tradename of the reportis irrelevant. Credit grantors demand a report with current informationof high quality to reduce their risk of loss from their credit grantingactivities. Indeed, our investigation revealed that credit grantors, especially nationaland regional credit grantors, are very sophisticated in their ability toevaluate credit information quality on a local level. Such companies commonlydo business with all four credit reporting networks. They are frequentlyvisited by sales agents of the local credit bureau as well as those ofthe network vendor. Their purchasing decisions are based upon careful evaluationsof file and other product quality considerations, as well as price andservice factors. They often ask sales agents to provide file comparisons,comparing the number of trade lines, bits of public record information,credit inquiries, age of information and so forth, to determine which companyhas the best information in a given area.\4\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ The sophistication of credit grantors in evaluatinglocal file quality is aptly demonstrated by their use of preference lists.Many large credit grantors, all the vendors, and some large credit bureaus(including CBC) have developed lists that identify which vendor has thebest file, and which is the best alternative, in a given zip code or state.Hawaii raises still another concern with respect to the proposed FinalJudgment's impact on electronic compilations of information.\4\\5\<NOTE/> It notes that most credit grantors now obtain credit reportselectronically, via telecommunications lines, on either teletype machinesor computer terminals. It claims that, at present, many of these devicescan interact with both the Chilton and TRW data bases so that credit grantorscan obtain credit reports from either company. Hawaii apparently beleivesthat successful affiliation with a different network vendor will be hamperedby the latter's inability to join such an electronic system. However, eachof the four networks has the ability to provide credit reports via teletypeor computer terminals, and the computer equipment and/or software necessaryto permit electronic transmission of credit reports is readily available.Nor should credit grantors experience significant additional costs. Ifa credit grantor has been willing to purchase or lease computer equipmentthat gave it access to TRW and Chilton in the past, then it should be willingto purchase or lease computer equipment that will permit it to access TRW'sdata base and that of the vendor with which Hawaii affiliates.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ Hawaii Comments at 6. 4. <T3>The Transaction Should not be Enjoined. </T3>As noted above, CBC, Hawaii,and Rochester all take the view, either explicitly or implicitly, thatnothing less than a permanent injunction prohibiting TRW's acquisitionof Chilton will provide an adequate remedy for the violation alleged inthe Complaint. In effect, they argue that <T3>no </T3>settlement of this litigation should be permitted. Acceptanceof that argument would represent an extraordinary restriction on the prosecutorialdiscretion of the United States. It would require this Court and the Departmentof Justice to undertake the substantial loss, risks, and delays of litigatingto a final conclusion a case of substantial complexity, despite the Department'sconsidered judgment that an adequate remedy can be obtained without imposingsuch costs on the taxpayers. We are not aware of an instance in which a court has rejcted a proposedconsent decree in its entirety in the course of a public interest review.Such a conclusion should not be reached absent a compelling demonstrationof the inadequacy of other forms of relief. The commenters have not made such a demonstration here.\4\\6\<NOTE/> Their explanations of how competitive harm might occur cannotbe reconciled with the fact that competition exists and is growing in localmarkets as the national networks seek to enter new markets. Their explanationsare also premised upon their belief that credit grantors cannot be trustedto protect their interests. Since credit grantors tend to be relativelylarge and financially sophisticated firms, it can be presumed that theywould express their concern to the Court of the United Sates if they feltthat the proposed Final Judgment would reduce their competitive optionsin the future. The absence of any expression of concern by these customersof credit reporting services strongly confirms the correctness of the UnitedStates' competitive analysis in this case.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\ The fact that TRW has raised the price of its Bostoncredit reports to CBC's Pittsburgh credit bureau from $.75 to $4.00 providesno basis to conclude that TRW will gain market power if the proposed FinalJudgment is entered. Rather, it suggests that the Boston office has takenan inopportune time to close a loophole that CBC has been using to itsadvantage. As noted above, a credit bureau can purchase credit reportsfrom other bureaus or offices on the network at a reduced price, normallyabout $.75. Credit bureaus not on the network, however, generally pay theretail price, commonly $3 or $4.00. CBC's Pittsburgh bureau is affiliatedwith TRW and thus would normally be entitled to the wholesale price. Itappears, however, that CBC has been purchasing credit reports from TRW'sBoston files through Pittsburg for customers of CBC's New Hampshire creditbureau, a Chilton affiliate. The price change, then, is motivated by aneffort to close the avenue by which a Chilton bureau obtains TRW creditreports at the wholesale price. The TRW really had market power in theBoston market, it would increase its wholesale prices to other TRW or Chiltonbureaus, or retail price to credit grantors. We have no evidence of suchprice increases.5. <T3>Other Relief Options. </T3>CBC and Hawaii argue that the Departmentdid not give adequate consideration to other relief options.\4\\7\<NOTE/> They suggest that the options of forcing the outright saleof owned files and of forcing the sale of combined files are superior tothat chosen by the Department. Their position, however, is predicated upontheir belief that the firm that has the most credit inquiries in its filewill, for that reason alone, have enduring market power. As we have shown,this position is contradicted by experience. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ CBC Comments at 7 and Hawaii Comments at 9. CBC changed its position in its supplemental comments. There it arguesthat the proposed Final Judgment should be modified to require divestitureof bureaus owned by TRW or Chilton rather than requiring the release ofindependent affiliates. CBC bases this argument on its belief that if itis forced to affiliate with another vendor, its ability to compete willbe diminished, and that it is inequitable to place the burden of correctingthe competitive problems of the acquisition on a non-party.\4\\8\<NOTE/> To avoid this hardship to itself, CBC asks that it be allowedto remain on the TRW-Chilton system and that the TRW affiliate be terminatedinstead. This request indicates that CBC's true concern is not preservationof competition, but avoiding the expense and inconvenience of changingaffiliation. Indeed, CBC's goal might be to <T3>reduce</T3> competition in New Hampshire. If their argument that regionalcoverage and inquiries are so important is correct, CBC's dominant shareof the New Hampshire market combined with TRW's position in Boston wouldcreate an even greater competitive problem in New Hampshire than the problemthey see created by the relief in the Final Judgment. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\8\ CBC Supplemental Comments at 9. In any event, there is no basis to believe that any independent creditbureau's ability to compete will be irreparably diminished. That is notto day that the proposed Final Judgment may not affect the commenters'businesses. \4\\9\<NOTE/> Market shares may change; there may be some costs associatedwith switching affiliations; and perhaps some disruption of day to dayroutines. However, we can conclude that any burden or cost to independentcredit bureaus will not be significant \5\\0\<NOTE/> and that their ability to compete will not be threatened.The explanations that have been offered that suggest otherwise simply donot withstand close scrutiny.\5\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\9\ It is not unusual for a consent decree to affect theinterests of third parties. <T3>See Texaco Inc., et al. </T3>FTC Complaints and Orders 1983-1987, andpara;22,168(July 10, 1984) (Texaco ordered to divest 1900 associated gasoline stations)(The Complaint and Consent Order are set out <T3>In the Matter of Texaco, Inc., </T3> 104 F.T.C. 241 (1984)); <T3>United States </T3>v.<T3> Carrols Development Corp., </T3>454 F.

Thereis no reason to believe that such costs would be substantially differentthan the costs of changing to, for example, CBI. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\ Given the need to allocate exclusive territories toaffiliates and offices in this industry, TRW may have intended to eliminateoverlapping territories in any event. The primary benefit of the transactionto TRW is the creation of a single national credit information data base. 6. <T3>The Market for Data Processing Services. </T3>CBC and Hawaii arguethat the proposed Final Judgment will not correct all the competitive problemsraised by the acquisition. They note that TRW and Chilton are two of onlyfour providers of data processing services to independent credit bureaus.In their view, the combination of TRW and Chilton will substantially lessencompetition in the sale of such services to independent credit bureaus.\5\\2\<NOTE/> CBC also asserts that the Department's Competitive ImpactStatement should have included a comprehensive discussion of concentration,entry barriers, and transaction efficiencies in a national network vendormarket.\5\\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\2\ CBC Comments at 4-5 and Hawaii Comments at 2. CBC states,and we agree, that the typical number of vendors in a given market is three.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\3\ CBC Supplemental Comments at 3-6. CBC and Hawaii are asserting that the Court, in deciding whether the proposedFinal Judgment is in the public interest, should consider alleged antitrustviolations that were not the subject of the government's Complaint. Theyare mistaken as a matter of law. It is well established that a court'spublic interest inquiry is limited to an evaluation of the remedy proposedfor violations alleged in the government's complaint \5\\4\<NOTE/> and that a court cannot base its public interest determinationon antitrust concerns other than those alleged in the complaint.\5\\5\<NOTE/> The issue in a Tunney Act proceeding is ``whether the reliefprovided for in the Proposed Judgment is adequate to remedy the allegationsof antitrust violation as set out in the Complaint.'' \5\\6\<NOTE/> The APPA does not give a court the authority to order theUnited States to file a broader complaint than the Department of Justice,in the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion, has determined is appropriate.\5\\7\<NOTE/> In summary, there is no basis for CBC's assertion that theeffects of the transaction on affiliates' access to alternative sourcesof data processing services is a basis for finding that the judgment isnot in the public interest.\5\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\4\ <T3>See United States </T3>v.<T3> Waste Management, Inc., supra, </T3>andpara;66,651 at page 63,046. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\5\ <T3>United States </T3>v.<T3> BNS, Inc.,</T3> 858 F.2d 456, 462-63 (9th Cir. 1988). Hawaii assertsthat this Court must determine whether the decree ``is consistent with[the Department's] original prayer for relief'' (that is, that the acquisitionbe enjoined). Hawaii comments at 9. The relief in a consent decree neednot be identical to that prayed for in the complaint. Absent the divestiturein the overlapping markets, an injunction would have been appropriate.But the proposed Final Judgment calls for precisely that divestiture. Consequently,this Court need only determine whether the relief in the proposed FinalJudgment is a reasonable enforcement means of correcting the competitiveharm we have alleged. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\6\ <T3>United States</T3> v. <T3>Bechtel Corp., </T3>1979-1 Trade Cas.

For the same reasons, CBC's argument that the proper relevant market inthis transaction should be the New England region is outside the scopeof the Complaint and should be summarily rejected.\59\<NOTE/> In any event, such a market definition provides no basisfor finding that the proposed Final Judgment is not in the public interestbecause the Final Judgment corrects the competitive problems that wouldexist in such a market.\60\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ CBC Supplemental Comments at 8. Defining the relevantgeographic market is a far more complex process than CBC has undertaken.``The proper question to be asked in this case is not where the partiesto the merger do business or even where they compete, but where, withinthe area of competitive overlap, the effect of the merger on competitionwill be direct and immediate.''<T3> United States</T3> v.<T3> Philadelphia National Bank,</T3> 374 U.S. 321, 357, 83 S.

The one case CBC citesin its supplemental comments actually undermines its argument for a regionalmarket definition. In that case, an administrative law judge for the FederalTrade Commission found that the appropriate geographic markets for assessingthe impact of acquisitions of credit bureaus were specific metropolitanareas.<T3> In the Matter of Retail Credit Company,</T3> 92 F.T.C. 1, 99-102 (1978).His decision was affirmed by the Commission,<T3> Id.</T3> at 131<T3> et seq.</T3> On appeal, the decision of the Commission was reversedand remanded on the grounds that the Commission's conclusion that creditreports and mortgage reports constituted a single product was unsupportedby the evidence.<T3> Equifax, Inc.</T3> v.<T3> F.T.C.,</T3> 168 F.2d 63 (9th Cir. 1980). In fact, the Department carefully considered in the course of its investigationwhether the merger would produce the anticompetitive effects alleged byCBC and Hawaii. Interviews with numerous independent credit bureaus failedto elicit any significant concern that the elimination of Chilton as acompeting network vendor would reduce competition in the provision of networkservices to such independent bureaus. More importantly, the ultimate consumersof credit reports indicated that a reduction in the number of networksfrom four to three would be beneficial to them. These consumers felt thatthey would be able to obtain more comprehensive information as a resultof the merger, and that three networks were sufficient to ensure continuedvigorous competition in the collection and sale of credit information.7.<T3> Contractural Disputes.</T3> The CCRC comments do not go to the competitiveeffects of the proposed Final Judgment, but to TRW's right to sell creditinformation relating to individuals residing in certain Texas zip codes.\61\<NOTE/> CCRC argues that it purchased the files concerning theseindividuals in 1987, and in support of its claim, it has provided the Departmentwith a copy of its contract with TRW. CCRC asks that the United Stateswithdraw its consent to the judgment as currently written and require thatit be modfied to eliminate the requirement that TRW sell these files.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ CCRC claims its own approximately one-tenth of the zipcodes the propsed Final Judgment requires TRW sell to Trans Union. We believethe contract dispute involves a much smaller fraction of the files thatmust be sold. TRW has written the Department reasserting its belief that it owns thefiles in question. It also has submitted evidence, in the form of contractamendments, to support its position. The Department is not in a position to resolve the contract dispute betweenTRW and its affiliate. Nor is the Department willing to eliminate the requirementthat TRW sell these files. The requirement was included in the decree becauseof representations by TRW that these ``full files'' in its network, a representationthat, if true, would result in competitive harm in the affected market.In the Department's view, the contractural dispute between TRW and CCRCdoes not provide a basis to withdraw our consent to the proposed FinalJudgment, to modify its scope, or for the Court to find that it is notin the public interest. In our view, reliance on TRW's representationswas appropriate and TRW should bear the consequences if those representationsprove to be inaccurate. Consequently, CCRC's objections should be addressedand resolved by TRW, consistent with the provisions of the proposed FinalJudgment as currently drafted, or by the courts in any separate proceedingthat CCRC may choose to initiate to resolve its contractural dispute withTRW.\62\<NOTE/> If subsequent events should demonstrate that TRW cannot sellthe disputed files, the proposed Final Judgment permits the parties toapply to this Court to obtain such other relief as is necessary or appropriate.\63\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ In this regard, a contract dispute on the date of terminationmay exist between Chilton and Rochester. Rochester Comments at 6. Rochesterhas brought the matter to our attention, but indicates its belief thatthe matter should not be resolved in the context of this public interestdetermination.

Specifically, it is our assertion that the CompetitiveImpact Statement filed in this matter is defective in several very seriousrespects:(1) it misdefines and misconstrues the relevant product markets and theinteractive relationship between various geographic markets;(2) it misunderstands the mechanics of the credit reporting industry, andas a consequence, errs in its analysis of, <T3>inter alia,</T3> entry barriers and the adverse consequences of concentrationof market power; and(3) as a result of the foregoing errors in analysis, its conclusions asto the efficacy of the proposed Consent Decree, and its evaluations ofother possible remedies to prevent competitive harm as a result of themerger, are simply wrong.Accordingly, we urge that the Justice Department withdraw its proposedConsent Decree, and act to prevent consummation of the proposed acquisitionuntil a solution which genuinely addresses the serious anti-competitiveeffects of the acquisition can be found.A. The Competitive Impact Statement Misconstrues the Relevant MarketsIt is plain from a careful reading of the Competitive Impact Statement,and the conclusions reached therein, that the Justice Department has basedits analysis on the premise that only one market_``provision of full fileconsumer credit reports''_will be affected by the acquisition of Chiltonby TRW. Unfortunately, this analysis ignores the actual functioning ofthe credit reporting industry, and consequently provides a faulty foundationfor the Department's competitive analysis model.Initially, it must be understood that the credit reporting industry operatesat two inter-dependent, yet highly distinct levels. At the level proximateto credit report customers (i.e., credit grantors) are the credit bureaus.These credit bureaus own all credit information for individuals residingwithin a particular geographic locale_other credit bureaus own the creditinformation for individuals residing within other geographic areas. Asa consequence, credit bureaus engage in three different sales functions:(1) <T3>Local Sales.</T3> In these sales of credit reports, a report concerninga resident of the bureau's geographic territory is sold to a customer withinthat territory. In this situation, the bureau is selling information whichit owns.(2) <T3>Sales of Reports Concerning Non-Resident Individuals.</T3> In thissituation, a bureau receives a request for a credit report from a localcustomer concerning a resident of another bureau's geographic territory.Because the other bureau owns the credit information concerning this individual,the local credit bureau must purchase the credit report from the bureauin whose territory the subject individual resides. The sale of such reportsbetween credit bureaus, generally at a price lower than such reports aresold directly to customers, is known in the industry as ``wholesaling.''The local credit bureau profits on these sales by adding a surcharge tothe ``wholesale'' price.(3) <T3>Sales of Reports Concerning Resident Individuals to Other Credit Bureaus.</T3>The flip-side of credit report sales to customers respecting non-residentindividuals is the sale of credit reports concerning resident individualsto credit bureaus in other locales. The local credit bureaus profit onthese sales by receipt of the ``wholesale'' price for each report.Within the credit bureau level there are essentially two types of operations:wholly-owned subsidiary bureaus of corporations such as TRW and Chilton;and independent bureaus, such as the Credit Bureau Services of New Hampshire,which are affiliated by contract with vendors such as TRW and Chilton.The second tier of the credit bureau industries_i.e., vendors such as TRWand Chilton_perform a variety of functions which are an outgrowth of thetypes of credit report sales engaged in by credit bureaus. In the contextof local sales by credit bureaus, these vendors' role is limited to providingdata processing services for the credit bureau. In other words, the vendor,for a fee, is simply storing credit information owned by the credit bureauand printing that information (or transmitting it to a computer terminal)when requested by the bureau.In a ``wholesale'' credit report transaction, in which one credit bureauis buying the credit report for resale from another credit agency, thevendor has a broader function. In these transactions, in addition to providingdata processing services, the vendor serves as a network for informationbetween various credit bureaus.The two-tiered structure of the credit report industry is confused by thefact that vendors such as TRW and Chilton also own a number of credit bureausthroughout the country. Thus, at the vendor level, TRW and Chilton competenationwide (along with several other vendors) for contracts to providedata processing and networking services to independent credit bureaus.On the other hand, at the credit bureau level, Chilton and TRW competethrough their wholly-owned bureaus with the bureaus of other vendors andwith independent credit agencies, such as Credit Bureau Services of NewHampshire. At the vendor level, the product market is for data processingand networking services, and the customers in this market are independentand wholly-owned credit bureaus. At the credit bureau level, the productmarket is for credit reports, and the customers in this market are creditgrantors.The Competitive Impact Statement fails in any manner to address this distinction.Rather, the Competitive Impact Statement addresses the market as if therewere only one product (the credit reports) and Chilton and TRW competedonly in that market. In other words, this analysis, while briefly alludingto the existence of independent credit bureaus such as Credit Bureau ofNew Hampshire, ignores their existence in evaluating the acquisition solelyin terms of competitive harm to credit grantors.Once the over-simplification of the credit reporting industry containedin the Competitive Impact Statement is understood, the anti-competitivedamages of the Chilton acquisition to customers in the upstream market(in particular, to independent credit bureaus) becomes obvious. At thebeginnming of 1988, five vendors competed in this upstream market: Chilton,TRW, CBI/Equifax, Transunion and ACS. During 1988, CBI/Equifax enteredinto a contractual arrangement whereby ACS ceased to provide data processingand networking services. Thus, if the proposed Chilton acquisition is approved,the number of vendors will be reduced to three.The number of credit bureaus competing in a particular geographic territoryis generally three. If the number of vendors is reduced to three, competitionin the vendor/credit bureau market, at least in many geographic territories,will be significantly reduced or eliminated. It is the nature of this industrythat vendors deal exclusively with one bureau in a given market. Thus,if the proposed acquisition is consummated, and a credit bureau in a particulargeographic market, as a result of poor service or price increases, seeksto change vendors, it will have only the potential to affiliate with oneof the two vendors not now affiliated with that bureau. At present, sucha bureau has a third alternative, the vendor not currently presently inthe market, with whom to seek a deal. When a bureau can choose betweenonly the two vendors already in the market, its existing market share willlimit such discussions (if any) to vendors who have a relationship witha smaller independent competitor in the market_no vendor is going to discontinueits relationship with a given bureau to enter into one which will offerit a smaller volume of business.Thus, in effect, in a market with three independent credit bureaus, thesmallest bureau (in terms of market share) will have no option but continuationof its existing vendor relationship (or going out of business), the middlebureau will have but one possible alternate vendor, and only the largestbureau will have, in the best possible scenario, two alternatives to itsexisting vendor rather than three or four (which would have included vendorsanxious to enter the market). These options will likely be even furtherlimited by the difficulty of inducing vendors to abandon the security (orrequirements) of their existing contractual relationships.Of course, the foregoing analysis ignores an even more serious limitationupon the ability of an independent credit bureau to effectively switchvendors_the vendor-owned bureau. In the vast majority of geographic territoriesin which an independent credit bureau competes, one or both of the othercredit bureaus are vendor-owned. Obviously, a vendor is not going to abandonits wholly-owned bureau (and the profits earned therefrom) to enter intoan affiliation contract with a competing independent credit bureau, unlessthat independent bureau would offer a substantial increase in market shareover what the vendor's wholly-owned bureau has.The existence of a fourth and fifth vendor in the vendor-bureau markethas always served to prevent any particular vendor from using its marketpower to control the price of services to an independent bureau. Withoutthis protection, these vendors will dramatically increase their power overprice and even, by the threat of refusing to do business, be able to seekto force such independent bureaus to sell out to the vendor.B. The Competitive Impact Statement Misunderstands The Mechanics Of TheCredit Reporting IndustryThe Competitive Impact Statement further errs in its analysis of the entrybarriers in the credit reporting industry and in its reliance solely uponthe Herfindahl-Hirshman Index in measuring the anti-competitive effectsof market concentration in this industry. Specifically, the CompetitiveImpact Statement ignores the fact that because the number of credit inquiriesregarding an individual is an important factor to many credit grantorsin determining whether to extend credit, and accordingly, a crucial factorin the value of a credit report, the bureau which receives the largestnumber of inquiries (and thereby reports those inquiries on its report)is the one perceived as the bureau selling the most useful report.As the Competitive Impact Statement recognizes, the number of credit inquiriesmade respecting a particular individual is important information to creditgrantors_it is established that the number of inquiries, and thereforecredit activity, is an important indicator of the credit worthiness ofthe particular applicant. Perhaps just as importantly, the number of inquiriesis perceived to impact upon the reliability of the credit report. The morefrequently inquiries are made, the more often a bureau has had the opportunityto cross-check an individual credit history and thereby identify as relevantinformation contained in files listing a different address, marital status,or other identifying information. The credit grantors' preference for abureau receiving the largest volume of inquiries (i.e., the bureau withthe largest market share) significantly protects the market share of thedominant bureau. The Herfindahl-Hirshman Index simply does not measurethis aspect of market concentration found rather uniquely in the creditreporting industry.An example of the entrenchment a dominant firm enjoys at the credit bureaulevel is the experience of our own affiliated bureau in Cleveland, OH.We entered that market in 1982. In that market, our competitor enjoys anapproximate 85% market share. We, on the other hand, despite having alltape and public record information (i.e., the type of information the CompetitiveImpact Statement deems crucial to its entry barrier analysis), have approximately10% of the market. Our competitor charges $1.56 per report. We have chargedas low as $.75, with no charge for inquiries in which no information isfound, and yet have made no appreciable penetration into that market.The Competitive Impact Statement fails to address this entrenchment ofmarket shares in the credit bureau market. The effect of this entrenchmentis to make it extremely difficult for any new entrant in a market to hopefor market penetration even over the long term of more than 10%-15%. Thisbarrier is obviously a significant disincentive to many potential entrantsin this industry. Combined with the limited number of vendors available,if the acquisition is approved, it makes new bureau entries practicallyan impossibility. Moreover, as discussed below, such entrenchment profoundlylimits the usefulness of requiring the sale of copies of bureau files asa vehicle to protect competition.C. Of The Possible Remedies To The Anti-Competitive Effects Of The ChiltonAcquisition Outlined In The Competitive Impact Statement, The One ChosenIs The Least EfficaciousThe sum of the foregoing discussion is to point out that the Justice Department'sproposed remedy to the anti-competitive effects of the Chilton acquisitionsimply will not prevent serious anti-competitive effects from resulting.The mere selling of copies of files and termination of affiliation agreementswill have little impact in diminishing the anti-competitive effect of theacquisition. In our view, only enjoining the acquisition can completelyprevent serious and irreparable harm to the vendor/bureau market in thecredit reporting industry. At a minimum, the Justice Department shouldrequire divestiture of wholly-owned bureaus in those markets in which mergerof bureaus will create significant market power in the remaining bureau.That the Justice Department's current proposal will not remedy the anti-competitiveinjury which the Chilton acquisition will create is an inevitable conclusionfrom an informed understanding that the credit reporting industry is nota single market, but rather two distinct markets. The remedy of contractterminations and file sales does <T3>nothing</T3> to protect the more vulnerable market, the vendor-bureaurelationship. In fact, in some instances this remedy reenforces the harmto this market that is inherent in the Chilton acquisition. For example,the requirement that TRW terminate its existing contracts with variousindependent credit bureaus primarily injures each independent bureau byforcing it to seek another, less established vendor. The bias against independentbureaus is plain_while requiring termination of numerous contracts withindependent bureaus, the proposed Order does not require TRW to divestitself of a single wholly-owned bureau. Even in circumstances in whichthe Order requires TRW to sell off a copy of a particular file, it is notrequired to include the Chilton portion of the file, or to cease usinginformation from either file in credit reports sold by its merged wholly-ownedbureau. All TRW is required to do is sell off what will be perceived asa lower quality file of information to buyers who as yet have absolutelyno foothold in the relevant markets and no assurance of continuing updatedinformation.The Competitive Impact Statement's discussion of the Department's rejectionof other alternative remedies further reveals the misunderstanding of theworkings of this industry. In rejecting the possibilities of requiringTRW to sell even some of its (or Chilton's) wholly-owned bureaus or ofprohibiting TRW from keeping the whole merged TRW-Chilton files, the Departmenthas failed to consider the overwhelming entrenching effect a large marketshare creates in this industry. Likewise, in refusing to require TRW tosell new market entrants the combined TRW-Chilton file, the Departmentignored the fact that credit grantors will inevitably perceive TRW to havemore complete information, and thereby shun any purchaser of the ``Chiltoninformation only'' file.The articulated reasons for rejection of injunctive relief to prohibitthe proposed acquisition even more blindly ignore the realities of thecredit reporting industry. In concluding that the mere termination of vendorcontracts and sale of file copies will create viable competition to TRW,the Department ignores the real barriers to entry this acquisition creates.Specifically, in markets in which affiliates are terminated, competitionwill decrease rather than increase, since existing independent bureauswill be forced into vendor contracts with a vendor new to an area, andlikely having a smaller nationwide market share. The sale of file copiesto a newcomer in a market in which the merger of Chilton and TRW bureaushas created a single bureau with overwhelming market power cannot be said,in this industry, to guarantee active competition. Rather, it guaranteesan entrenched TRW bureau. The effects of the proposed acquisition on the vendor-bureau market andupon independent bureaus is well illustrated by the acquisition's impactupon Credit Bureau Services of New Hampshire and the New Hampshire andEastern Massachusetts markets. Credit Bureau Services of New Hampshirenow uses Chilton as its vendor. Once the acquisition takes place, CBI/Equifaxwill take over as vendor. In the interrelated territory of Eastern MassachusettsCBI will have no immediate market (as opposed to Chilton's 40% share).Thus, in the market in which Credit Bureau Services of New Hampshiare doesthe vast majority of its wholesale business, it will be cut-off becauseof the elimination of Chilton as a possible vendor to it. Moreover, becausethe combination of TRW and Chilton will change the Eastern Massachusettsmarket from one in which their wholly-owned bureaus competed while holdingroughly equal (i.e., 45-50%) market shares each into a market with oneentrenched dominate (80-85% market share) bureau, Credit Bureau Servicesof New Hampshire, despite the Department's claims, will permanently losea significant portion of the wholesale sub-market it now enjoys. Similarly, other independent bureaus will be permanently harmed by thisacquisition. Indeed, in any areas in which an independent bureau is presentlyaffiliated with Chilton, and in which TRW and either Transunion or CBI/Equitydo business, the independent bureau will always be confined to the newvendor it finds to contract with_no alternative will remain available.Only blocking the acquisition can prevent this permanent damage to competition.In closing, we would note that the anti-competitive effects of the proposedacquisition have already reared their head. Credit Bureau Services of NewHampshire has for some years sought to provide its New Hampshire customerswith the product they desire. Thus, when our customers have indicated theywish to obtain TRW credit reports for residents of Eastern Massachusetts,we have accommodated our customers. We have done so by obtaining the reportthrough our affiliated bureau in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which has contractedwith TRW as a vendor. This practice is entirely permissible within ourvendor agreement. Recently, however, and plainly in anticipation of itsdomination of the Eastern Massachusetts market, the TRW controlled Bostonbureau has informed us that the wholesale price of its reports will increasefrom $.75 to $4.00 (i.e., by 533%). (Please see the attached letter ofPamela J. Lawlor to James McGinnis.) Plainly, this price increase is nothingmore than an attempt to use TRW's new-found market power in Boston to leveragean increased market share throughout New England.

TRW, Inc. </T3>Consent Decree Dear Mr. Grossman: This letter contains the additional comments of CBCCompanies regarding the Notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 2, 1988, as amended December 12,1988, respecting the proposed Consent Decree in <T3>United States v. TRW, </T3>Case No. C88-4253 now pending in the UnitedStates District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. We transmittedCBC Companies' initial written comments to you on January 18, 1989, inthe form of a letter from William H. Price, the President of CBC Companies.We are offering these additional written comments to supplement and expandupon our client's concerns regarding the anticompetitive effects of theTRW acquisition and the proposed Consent Decree. As a concerned citizenand a customer of both TRW and Chilton, our client believes that the ConsentDecree does not address the actual anti-competitive effects of the Chiltonacquisition. Our client has asked us to reiterate its grave concern with the harm itand other independent credit bureaus will suffer from the anticompetitiveeffects of the TRW acquisition of Chilton and the further anticompetitiveeffects of the proposed Consent Decree. Our client's position is that,at a minimum, the proposed Consent Decree should be modified to allow itand similarly situated credit bureaus to continue to contract, on a fairand reasonable basis with the successor to the Chilton/TRW operation, suchas in the New England area. In addition, our client believes that unlessthe Consent Decree is modified to require the complete divestiture of eitherthe Chilton or TRW credit bureau in Boston and like cities, the acquisitionwill not only impose severe economic harm on independent credit bureaus,but create an entrenched and dominant credit bureaus in various areas includingBoston and large parts of New England. In general, it is our view that the Consent Decree will not protect competitionin at least the following respects: (1) Although it attempts to deal with real competitive concerns, the Department'sproposed Consent Decree is competitively and economically harmful relativeto available alternatives and unduly disruptive and burdensome to CBC Companiesand others in the industry. (2) Under the Department's chosen ``remedy'' for the competitive problemscaused by this acquisition, retail level concentration will in some casesrise dramatically and immediately. For example in Boston, the HHI willrise by about 4500 points and a near dominant firm is likely to be createdat the credit bureau level. (3) By reducing the number of vendors of data processing and networkingservices from four to three, the acquisition greatly increases concentrationat the vendor/data processing level of the industry and thereby imposesa substantial risk of harm to competition, consumers, and to CBC Companies,a major purchaser of services from this level of the industry. As shownin our earlier comments, there are already indications of anticompetitiveprice increases. (4) The proposed Consent Decree results in a market structure which imposessubstantial additional costs on independent credit bureaus. For example,the New Hampshire operation of CBC Companies will be forced under the ConsentDecree to obtain credit reports, an essential input, from a lower qualityand less efficient supplier while allowing TRW to realize increased productquality and efficiency. Such a venture into ``industrial policy making''is inconsistent with the Department's long held view that the free marketshould be permitted to determine an industry's structure.(5) Imposing unnecessary cost increases on independent credit bureaus suchas Credit Bureau Services of New Hampshire is itself harmful to competition,because it weakens the competitive constraints on the merged firm, whichis likely to enjoy a near dominant position in various geographic regionsof the United States, such as in parts of New England, including Boston.Our client urges that the Department withdraw its proposed Consent Decree,and act to prevent consummation of the proposed acquisition until a reasonablyequitable and genuine solution to the anticompetitive effects of the acquisitioncan be found. Our reasons for these concerns are set forth in the January18th letter of William H. Price and in the following paragraphs.<ITAG tagnum="85">I. The Competitive Impact Statement Does Not Fully Reflect the Potentialfor Competitive Harm.</ITAG>As we have indicated in our earlier comments, we disagree with the Department'sanalysis of relevant markets and of the mechanics of the credit reportingindustry. In our view, the Department's conclusions in these areas haveapparently led it to underestimate the potential for competitive harm fromthe acquisition and choose, from legally and practically available remedies,the remedy that is least efficacious.A. The Department's Nearly Exclusive Focus on the Credit Bureau or ``Retail''Level of the Industry, as Reflected in the Competitive Impact Statementand other Documents in this Matter, Leads to Understatement of the CompetitiveDangers from the Acquisition.As our earlier comments indicate, the Competitive Impact Statement as wellas other papers submitted by the Department in this matter do not reflectthe very high (and increasing) market concentration at the vendor levelin the credit reporting industry, or the impact to consumers and indepedentcredit bureaus, such as those owned by the CBC Companies, of the loss ofan independent source of supply and competition.This vendor level, now occupied by only four firms will become a highlyconcentrated triopoly if this acquisition is consummated. According tothe limited market data available to the CBC Companies, which our clientbelieves provide reasonable approximations to national shares at the vendorlevel, on a national basis TRW now has about a 30 percent market share,CBI/Equifax has approximately 40 percent, Transunion has 20 percent, andChilton 10 percent. Based on these figures, the present HHI at the vendinglevel is 3000, far above any of the Department's enforcement thresholds,and TRW's acquisition of Chilton substantially increases this already extremelyhigh concentration by 600 points, to 3600.As the Department and its economists know, voluminous economic literatureclearly indicates the importance of having a significant number of effectivecompetitors in a market, and in general, three is considered to be toofew. There is no generally accepted economic literature or legal authorityindicating that, absent an acquisition of a failing competitor or creationof substantial efficiencies attainable only by the acquisition in question,such a concentration-increasing merger is likely to be pro-competitive.An extensive economic analysis considering competitive risks, includingthe very real danger of collusion and market division at the vendor levelin this industry, would be required to establish that such a concentration-increasingmerger is not likely to substantially harm competition and consumers. Asthe Department's own <T3>Merger Guidelines</T3> clearly recognize, an even more extensive analysiswould be required to show that purported <T3>vendor-level</T3> efficiencies from the acquisition could justify thereal competitive risks. We believe the Department needs to further examinethis concentration-swelling deal, the potential efficiencies (if any) dueto combination of files and the potential competitive risks versus conceivableeconomic benefits at the vendor level.Moreover, as the Department is aware, in 1988 CBI/Equifax contracted withACS, another vendor, to take over all of its vendor functions, therebyreducing the number of independent vendors from five to four. The effectof this transaction needs to be considered.The Department may feel that the geographic market-extension effects ofboth the CBI/Equifax-ACS transaction and TRW's proposed acquisition ofChilton entail significant competitive benefits and efficiencies. If so,we respectfully suggest that the Department has an obligation to discussthis rationale and the evidence on which it is based in the CompetitiveImpact Statement.B. The Competitive Impact Statement Discusses Entry Conditions Only atthe Credit Bureau Level, and Should Also Consider Barriers to Entry atthe Vendor Level.We also believe consideration needs to be given to possible entry barriersor other impediments to competition at the vendor level. We do not believethat the solutions to competitive problems identified in local marketsfor retail credit reports solved those problems at the vendor level.It is clear that there are numerous barriers to entry and competition atboth levels of the credit reporting industry. Particularly relevant barriersat the vendor level include the time, expertise, and capital involved insetting up computer operations, and credibility and reputation for reliabilityboth with local merchants and financial institutions and national grantorsof credit. Although such credit grantors spend substantial amounts on creditreports, the costs of credit information are quite small in relation tothe risks of, among other things, inaccurate information or inaccessibilitydue to computer crashes or problems in data transmission. Given these considerations,entry conditions at the vendor level need to be separately analyzed andconsidered to make any Consent Decree in this matter effective.The Federal Trade Commission case ordering CBI/Equifax's predecessor firmto divest certain acquired credit bureaus provides support for the propositionthat there are substantial entry barriers at both levels of the creditreporting industry <T3>In the Matter of Retail Credit Company</T3>, 92 F.T.C. 1 (1978). Afterhearing substantial testimony from industry officials, the administrativelaw judge reached the following finding:There are substantial barriers to entry into credit reporting. They includethe need for support and cooperation of merchants and credit grantors,adequate file information, experience in the credit reporting industry,sufficient capital, ability to offer competitive prices and services and,in certain markets, computer technology.<ITAG tagnum="58">Vorys, Saler, Seymour and Pease</ITAG><T3>In the Matter of Retail Credit Company, </T3>Initial Decision, Findingsof Fact, par. 119, (February 10, 1976) 92 F.T.C. 1, (1978) (Citations totestimony omitted).Today, with computerization much more extensive, particularly at the vendinglevel, the entry barriers at that level are undoubtedly higher than theywere at the time the FTC considered the <T3>Retail Credit Co. </T3>case.The only entry barrier the Department identifies in this entire industryis one at the credit bureau level_specifically, the time and cost involvedin acquiring files of credit information. Apparently because of this view,the Department believes that requiring the sale of copies of files willalleviate any potential constraint on supply of services to users. TheDepartment also apparently believes that severing certain contracts (suchas CBC Companies' contract with Chilton in New Hampshire) and requiringthat independent bureaus not deal with the merged firm will provide bothdemand pressures that will rapidly generate efficient and competitive entryand expansion. However, if access of file copies such as made availableunder the proposed Consent Decree is not the only barrier, this remedywill not be effective.C. The Analytical Focus and Proposed Remedy Are Apparently Based on a FaultyView of the Potential Barriers to Entry into the Retail Level of the Industry.The Department has identified one of the key requisites for effective competitionat the credit bureau level of the industry: access on competitive termsto files of local credit information. Certainly, the time and cost of assemblinga file of such information is a hurdle that any competitor must overcome.However, it is our client's belief, based on long experience in the industry,that such time and cost requirements impose much less of a restraint thanthey did in the past. As a result, while access to and cost of local filesare important determinants of competitive success, such file access isfar from the only barrier. The relevant competitive and economic questionis not access to the ``physical'' requisites for producing a report (suchas files and computers). Rather, the relevant inquiry is what are the realmarket requirements for gaining market acceptance.The computerization of both the credit reporting industry and of many creditgrantors has substantially reduced the time and cost investments involvedin getting substantial amounts of local credit information. For example,when CBC Companies entered Cleveland in 1982, they were able rapidly toget substantial computerized files of local credit information on tapefrom banks and others. However, despite heavily discounted pricing, theCleveland operation has yet to achieve a major market penetration. Thereasons relate to the types of barriers cited above and noted in the FTC's<T3>Retail Credit Co. </T3>case. 92 F.T.C. 1 (1978).Despite having substantial credit information, because the Cleveland operationwas new, and CBC's office was small, the files had relatively little recentor current ``activity'' measured in terms of the number of credit grantorinquiries to the bureau. It is such very recent and ongoing inquiries whichprovide the cross-checks on file information which give a bureau the bestcredibility with local credit grantors. The importance of this file inquiryactivity, in turn, explains why leading local credit bureaus maintain substantialshares in many areas.Because credit grantors find file inquiry activity as well as the bureau'sscale of local coverage so important, the proposed Consent Decree's requirementfor the sale of file copies is unlikely to be of substantial or lastingcompetitive benefit. Our client's experience, reflecting broader marketplacerealities, is that mere access to files as such does not give a firm theability to compete effectively.D. The Department Uses Improper Definitions of Relevant Geographic Marketsand Fails To Consider Interrelationships Among Geographic Areas.As discussed in our earlier comments, the Department assessed market concentrationand the potential for competitive harm as well as the desirable parametersof relief based on analyses of local geographic markets. To be sure, underthe standards enunciated in the <T3>Merger Guidelines, </T3>there are numerous localized markets for creditreporting services. However, this does not imply that <T3>only </T3>these localized markets are relevant for assessing the competitiveimpact of this transaction or of the proposed Consent Decree. Instead,numerous broader areas are highly relevant to the assessments which theCompetitive Impact Statement is supposed to provide.Although local credit bureaus and local information remain essential formany transactions and for many credit grantors, increased population mobility,ever-increasing use of nationwide mail and telephone ordering, and thewidening geographic scope of many retail operations have increased thegeographic scope of the information that a credit bureau must be able toprovide. This both broadens the scope of certain relevant geographic marketsand increases the potential importance of vendors covering appropriategeographic areas.CBC Companies' situation in New Hampshire provides an illuminating exampleof the competitive importance of this broadening geographic scope of theindustry. For many retailing operations, such as Filene's, New Hampshiremight be considered, in effect, a ``suburb'' of Boston. A very substantialproportion of New Hampshire credit transactions are with residents of Bostonand other parts of Massachusetts, as well as other states in the area.As a result, Credit Bureau Services of New Hampshire, is very dependenton credit information obtained through its contract with Chilton, throughwhich it obtains all or most of its ``Boston'' reports from the Chiltonbureau in that area.CBC Companies estimates that about 35 percent of the reports its New Hampshireoperations sell are ``local reports'' or inquiries about New Hampshireresidents from credit grantors in that state. Since 15 percent of its reportsare ``inbound regional'' or inquiries about New Hampshire residents fromcredit grantors in New England but primarily with offices in Boston, onlyabout half of CBC Companies' New Hampshire reports concern local residents,and a substantial proportion of these reports come from outside the areaand from grantors served in their own areas by other local bureaus.A full 18 percent of our client's sales to New Hampshire credit grantorsare ``outbound regional'' reports_inquiries from New Hampshire grantorsabout residents of other parts of New England, many from Boston. Thus,a substantial portion of CBC Companies' New Hampshire sales are dependenton Boston, and a major portion of the reports provided are based on informationnow purchased from Chilton. Given this relationship it makes little orno sense to assess competition in New Hampshire, Boston, or New Englandsolely in terms of local concentration.Such geographic interrelationships show that relevant credit reportingmarkets are not all local. The market relevant for assessing competitionto provide credit reports to many New Hampshire merchants must includethe Chilton Bureau serving the Boston area. The same logic shows that therelevant credit report market for many New Hampshire credit transactionsmust include the TRW Boston area bureau and other bureaus in various partsof New England and the Northeast.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Harm to CBC and Other Independent Credit Bureaus From the ProposedConsent Decree.</ITAG>As the Department knows, the Credit Bureau Services of New Hampshire willbe deprived of a supplier with whom it has had a long-term and successfulrelationship by the terms of the Consent Decree. It is our belief thatthe net effect of this contract termination is to make CBC a less effectivecompetitor, and thereby reduce competition in New Hampshire. By being forcedto deal with a new entrant in the Massachusetts credit bureau market, CBCwill be able only to offer a less saleable product to its customers. Theeffect of the Consent Decree in New Hampshire thus will be not to createa more competitive market, but rather to decrease competition, by decreasingCredit Bureau Services of New Hampshire's ability to compete. It is ourbelief, therefore, that the termination of the Credit Bureau of New Hampshire'scontract with Chilton Corporation after the acquisition will lessen thecompetition by weakening an effective competitor in the market.Nor is the termination of contract approach, it would appear, consistentwith the Department's determination that the sale of a file in a particularmarket will allow a new entrant sufficient entry into the market to competeeffectively. Application of this concept to New Hampshire, it would appearto CBC, would dictate that TRW be required to sell its New Hampshire file,but Credit Bureau of New Hampshire be permitted to continue its contractwith Chilton, or, in other words, negotiate with TRW for continuation ofthe Chilton contract in New Hampshire. After all, CBC is not a participantin the acquisition, and it would seem logical therefore to place the burdenof remedying the anticompetitive effects in New Hampshire of the acquisitionin New Hampshire by requiring a participant (TRW) to sell off its file.In our view, it is CBC, and not TRW, that is being required to subsidizethe entry and expansion of vendors, such as CBI/Equifax, into the New Englandmarket. CBC and its customers will have to pay the price for the anticompetitiveeffect of TRW's acquisition of Chilton, rather than that cost being borneby TRW. Two solutions can correct this problem_requiring TRW to divestitself of the Chilton Bureau in Boston, or requiring TRW to sell a copyof its file in New Hampshire. In CBC's view, either alternative is preferableto making it pay the cost of correcting the anticompetitive effects ofthis acquisition.In conclusion, we believe that the historical evidence does not supportthe effectiveness of selling a file as a remedy to the anticompetitiveeffects of this acquisition. Even if the Department is convinced, however,that such a sale will remedy the anticompetitive effects of this merger,CBC respectfully suggests that such a remedy could be applied in New Hampshireas well as in Massachusetts.

Rochester Credit Center isowned by a not-for-profit trade association, which in turn is owned bythe entire credit-granting community, who share equally, through Boardrepresentation, their concerns for price, product, services and crediteducation within the community. The trade association, comprised of over1,200 area businesses, owns the stock of Rochester Credit Center.It is the position of Rochester Credit Center that the proposed consentdecree in the above action will not prevent the anti-competitive effectsthat will result from the acquisition of Chilton by TRW. I speak specificallyto the situation in Rochester, but I believe that the situation is thesame in many other areas of the country referred to by the Justice Departmentin its complaint. In Rochester, it is clear to me that competition willreduced substantially if the terms of the consent decree are followed.The Justice Department has concluded in the Competitive Impact Statementthat the fact that credit vendors other than TRW and Chilton have ``fullfiles'' will ensure that the number of competitors in the market will remainthe same and that the market shares of various competitors will remainapproximately as they were before the merger. For the reasons explainedbelow, the presence of a ``full file'' is not a sufficient remedy to theills engendered by this merger.Rochester Credit Center also believes that with respect to its own situation,the proposed consent decree is inaccurate in one significant respect. Itassumes that the termination date of the affiliation agreement betweenRochester Credit Center and Chilton is June 1, 1990. As is explained laterin this letter, this is not the case.<ITAG tagnum="84">Anti-Competitive Effect of Merger</ITAG>The Competitive Impact Statement correctly has recognized that the credit-reportingbusiness is a highly concentrated market in which entry is very difficult.Further, in both its complaint and in its Competitive Impact Statement,the Justice Department recognizes that purchasers of consumer credit reportsmake their decision on which reports to buy primarily on the basis of thequality and quantity of information in the reports.Having recognized that the quality and quantity of credit report informationis critical, the Competitive Impact Statement concludes that so long asa credit vendor has a ``full file'', this is enough to satisfy the desireof purchasers of credit reports for files containing sufficient qualityand quantity of information. In fact, the presence of a ``full file'',standing alone, does not mean that the credit grantor buying the reportwill deem that the file has the quality and quantity of information thatit wants.Essentially, the Competitive Impact Statement ignores the fact that whilea file may be full, some files will be fuller than others. Moreover, theCompetitive Impact Statement ignores the fact that for credit grantors,some names have much greater market recognition than others, and the CompetitiveImpact Statement also ignores how difficult entry is in the face of thisname recognition.Quality and Quantity of File, and Name RecognitionParagraph ``16'' of the complaint filed in this action defines the informationthat constitutes a ``full file''. Rochester Credit Center does not disagreewith this definition, but does disagree with the concept that one ``fullfile'' is the same as another. By way of hyperbole, an 11-man footballteam composed of staff personnel from Rochester Credit Center is a ``fullfootball team'', but nobody would think that such a football team couldcompete with the San Francisco 49ers. Obviously, I do not mean to suggestthat a vendor that has the ``Full File'' information referred to in Paragraph``16'' of the complaint stands in the same relation to a vendor with amuch better ``Full File'' as an office football team stands in relationto the Superbowl champions. However, I do mean to suggest that to creditgrantors, some files are much fuller, and therefore much better, than others.The competitive impact statement ignores an important element of marketconcentration, namely that the number of credit inquiries regarding anindividual is a vital factor to most credit grantors when they are decidingwhether to extend credit. Therefore, the credit bureau that receives thelargest number of inquiries, and reports these inquiries on its report,is the bureau selling the most useful report. Its file is better than thatof a competitor with a ``Full File''.Not only is the number of inquiries, and therefore the credit activity,of a particular applicant an important indicator of the credit worthinessof the applicant, but it is also an important indicator of the reliabilityof the credit report. Under most circumstances, a credit grantor will prefera credit bureau receiving the largest number of inquiries, which simplymeans the credit bureau with the largest market share. This preferenceamong credit grantors will tend to protect the market share of the dominantbureau. In essence, a snowball effect is at work. A credit bureau witha large market share has that share because it has information desirableto credit grantors. They will turn to this bureau, thereby further enhancingthe market share of that bureau.The confidence that the credit grantor has in the name under which thelocal bureau does business is also an important factor that these creditgrantors consider when deciding what bureau or credit vendor will be contactedfor credit information. Since 1971, when Rochester Credit Center becamean affiliated bureau of Chilton, each and every credit report has carriedthe name of Chilton within the context of the report. Rochester CreditCenter has marketed its reports under the auspices of the Chilton Credimaticsystem, and substantial good will has been engendered for this name inthe Rochester area, as I am sure it has in the other areas of the country.TRW and Chilton have recognized the value of the Chilton name in a letterthey have sent to common TRW and Rochester Credit subscribers, advisingthem that Chilton will not become part of the TRW network in Rochester.All credit grantors in the Rochester area are familiar with both the TRWand the Chilton reports. This familiarity will be a major advantage tothe proposed TRW/Chilton entity in maintaining and attracting a greatermarket share. This same situation exists in the other areas referred toin the complaint and the Competitive Impact Statement.Because credit grantors are familiar with the Chilton name, they will perceiveit, and in most cases properly so, as being better. In trumpeting the factthat TRW will now have access to the best of both worlds_information fromTRW and information from Chilton_TRW is marketing the Chilton name, a namedeveloped in Rochester at great expense by Rochester Credit Center. Wehave no doubt that customers of Rochester Credit Center identify consumercredit reports by the Chilton name, much as a consumer using a moving vancompany recognizes it by the national name rather than by the name of alocal carrier.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reduced Competition as a Result of Merger</ITAG>As a result of this proposed merger, markets in which affiliates are terminated,such as Rochester, will suffer a decrease in competition. Independent bureauslike Rochester Credit Center will have to enter into contracts with vendorsnew to an area, who totally lack the name recognition and the local filethat leads credit grantors to certain vendors.If the merger occurs, Rochester Credit Center's share of the market willdrop dramatically. Given the way in which a company becomes entrenchedin this market, it will be extremely difficult for Rochester Credit Center,whichever other national vendor it affiliates with, to develop any significantmarket share.The Competitive Impact Statement recognizes that consumer credit reportingis subject to considerable economies of scale. Once a company has createda file that has the quantity and quality of information that credit grantorsdesire <T3>and </T3>the company has gained the confidence of consumers, it hasa great cost advantage over a new entrant to the market. Any company consideringentry into a market like Rochester must have the quality and quantity ofinformation that goes beyond having a ``full file,'' and must develop consumeracceptance. Consequently, a prior entrant can easily underprice it, andyet charge monopoly prices.Indeed, the market for consumer credit reporting may be described as anatural monopoly. There are only three ways that another firm can hopeto enter this market successfully. One is by use of a new, superior technologythat allows it to offer the product demanded at a lower price. We knowof no such technology in existence or on the horizon. The second possibilityoccurs when the market is expanding, the present monopolist is lazy anddoes not go after new business, and the new entrant can sign up new customersat a sufficiently rapid rate to overcome the costs of entry. This is unlikelyto occur as Rochester is a stable community that has not grown much inthe past nor is expected to expand much in the future. The third possibilityresults from the present monopolist giving such poor service that customersare willing to shift their business to a new entrant. We see no reasonfor this to occur, as we believe that TRW and Chilton provide good serviceto their customers.As it happens, the Rochester area has been served primarily by a duopoly_two,roughly equal-sized firms, Chilton and its associated company, RochesterCredit Center, and TRW. They have been in a stable competitive equilibrium,from which users of their services have benefited. The proposed mergerof Chilton and TRW will change this situation. TRW, combined with Chilton,will be in a position to drive Rochester Credit Center out of business.The newly-merged firm will have very deep pockets. It can afford to cutits prices and spend considerable sums on sales persuasion to take customersaway from Rochester Credit Center. Ironically, Rochester Credit Centermade this possibility more likely as a result of its significant and successfulefforts over the years to develop market recognition for the Chilton namein this area.Indeed, as I already mentioned, we have seen information deisseminatedby TRW heralding the fact that TRW will now have access to the best ofboth worlds_information from TRW and information from Chilton. As I explained,we have no doubt that customers of Rochester Credit Center identify consumercredit reports by the Chilton name, much as a customer using a moving vancompany recognizes it by the national name, rather than by the name ofthe local carrier.Because of the Chilton name recognition, we expect that a significant numberof customers will leave Rochester Credit Center and follow Chilton whenit becomes part of TRW. It is reasonable to anticipate that this changewill result in a significant shift in the current market concentration,and that TRW then will have a dominant share of the Rochester market.TRW can take advantage of this dominant position by lowering its prices.Because of TRW's financial reserves, this decrease in prices will not likelycause it any harm. Ultimately, TRW will drive Rochester Credit Center outof business. Of course, once Rochester Credit Center is out of the market, Rochester-areausers of consumer credit reports will be left with a single supplier, TRW_amonopolist. Once it achieves this monopoly position, TRW will be able toraise its prices. At this point, entry by another firm will be very unlikely,unless one of the three REMOTE possibilities outlined above occurs. Creditgrantors in the Rochester area then will have no alternative to TRW andwill be forced to pay monopoly prices. <ITAG tagnum="84">Contractual Rights of Rochester Credit Center </ITAG>The Competitive Impact Statement assumes that Rochester Credit Center'scontract with Chilton expires June 1, 1990. In fact, there is no such provisionin the contract between these companies. After receiving notice from Chilton that it intended to terminate RochesterCredit Center, I wrote to Van Smith, the President of Chilton, on November30, 1988, asking him to specify for me the contractual language that gaveChilton the right to terminate Rochester Credit Center. He responded withoutspecifying the contract in issue, and I wrote him again on December 15.At a later meeting with him, he acknowledged that a clarifying sentencehad been left out of the Rochester Credit Center agreement, and that theagreement was ambiguous as to when it could be terminated. In fact, theagreement does not contain a specific date for termination, and RochesterCredit Center plans to litigate vigorously the position taken by Chiltonand TRW that the Chilton contract with Rochester Credit Center expireson June 1, 1990. While we recognize that this may not be a significant factor to the JusticeDepartment, and that the Justice Department is far more interested in thecompetitive impact of the proposed merger, we did want to bring it to yourattention. <ITAG tagnum="84">CONCLUSION </ITAG>We believe that an analysis of the market and a true understanding of thecredit-reporting business demonstrates that the proposed merger will havesignificant anti-competitive effects in the Rochester area, and, we believe,in many other areas similar to Rochester. The alternative proposed in theconsent decree does not, for the reasons explained, resolve the difficulty.Therefore, unless the Justice Department can develop some alternative thatwill permit the merger to go forward, while ensuring that competition willremain in areas such as Rochester, it is the position of Rochester CreditCenter that the Justice Department should seek an injunction halting themerger. We have set up a meeting for February 2, 1989 with officials at the JusticeDepartment to discuss this matter further. At that time, we will be gladto answer any questions that representatives of the Justice Departmenthave and discuss our comments in detail.<ITAG tagnum="21">  Very truly yours, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">R.

TRW, Inc.</T3>, Civ. No. C88-4253 U.S. District Courtfor the Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division Dear Mr. Grossman: We are writing on behalf of Credit Data of Hawaii, Inc.,a Hawaii corporation (``CDH''). We have been provided with the proposedFinal Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement filed in the above-referencedmatter. On November 17, 1988, the United States Department of Justice (``Department'')filed a civil antitrust complaint under Section 15 of the Clayton Act (15U.S.C. andSection; 25) alleging that the proposed acquisition of ChiltonCorporation (``Chilton'') by TRW, Inc. (``TRW'') would violate Section7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. andSection; 18). Simultaneously, the Department and TRW filed a stipulation by which theyconsented to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment (``Consent Decree'').On that same day, the Department filed its Competitive Impact Statementas required by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act. The proposedConsent Decree approved the acquisition and required TRW to sell a copyof its consumer credit files in certain geographic areas, to sell a copyof Chilton's consumer credit files in other areas and to terminate contractsrelating to the sale of network services for certain specified marketingareas, including Hawaii. In accordance with the antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.andSection; 16(b), CDH submits these comments on the Consent Decree. As stated in the Complaint, the consumer credit reporting industry is alreadyhighly concentrated. There are currently four vendors of network servicesin the United States, including TRW and Chilton. (Complaint andpara; 15.)The merger of the two largest vendors of network services in the UnitedStates, leaving a total of three, raises serious questions of the continuedviability of competition in the credit reporting industry. CDH, however,will focus these comments on the competitive situation in Hawaii. The following portion of the proposed Consent Decree is the subject ofthis comment: Unless such notice has already been provided, TRW is ordered and directedto provide written notice to [Credit Data of Hawaii, Inc., Honolulu, Hawaii]of its intent to terminate contracts relating to the sale of network servicesfor the marketing areas. . . . It is CDH's position that the proposed final judgment should not be enteredas it is not in the public interest. CDH believes it will either be unableto affiliate with or sell its files to another competitor, or if successfulwill not be able to compete with TRW/Chilton. Either result would be tothe severe detriment of CDH. In CDH's view, the aspects of the proposedConsent Decree relating to Hawaii are likely to result in the near eliminationof competition in this state. Much has been said about the dangers to competitionposed by the increasing dominance of the two major forces in the creditreporting industry. However, the proposed consent judgment does not, atleast in Hawaii, adequately deal with those problems. 2. The Nature of the Credit Reporting Market Credit bureaus collect consumer credit information, store it in computersand sell it to credit grantors. Credit grantors use these consumer creditreports to determine whether to grant credit, or how much to grant, toindividuals. Credit grantors usually receive consumer credit reports electronicallythrough computer terminals. Vendors operate computer facilities that supplynetwork services to credit bureaus. (Complaint andpara; 15.) Currently, there are four vendors of network services in the United States,including TRW and Chilton. In 1986, the total United States credit reportingrevenues of all vendors from the sale of network services and credit reportswas about $410 million. (Complaint andpara; 15.) In 1987, TRW's sales totaledabout $140 million and Chilton's totaled about $93 million. (Complaintandpara;andpara; 13, 14.) Buyers purchase consumer credit reports primarily on the basis of the qualityand quantity of information in the reports. (Complaint andpara; 18.) TheDepartment claims that there is no substitute for consumer credit reportsthat a significant number of credit grantors would purchase in responseto a small, but significant increase in the price of the reports. (Complaintandpara; 18.) Entry into the business of providing consumer credit reports is difficult,time consuming and expensive. Generally, it takes three to five years tocollect sufficient information to provide full file credit reports in agiven market. Consequently, new entry by another party could not be accomplishedrapidly enough in any relevant geographic area to prevent the anti-competitiveresults in this transaction. Only credit bureaus that have comprehensive coverage in the local geographicarea in which the consumer about whom a credit report is sought residesare considered sources of credit reports. Thus, the relevant geographicmarkets for purposes of an antitrust inquiry are local and bounded by theoverlapping geographic areas covered by particular competing credit bureaus.(Complaint andpara; 19.) The relevant geographic market for purposes of CDH'sconcerns is the state of Hawaii. 1. Background of Credit Reporting in Hawaii Prior to 1981, when CDH first entered into a credit-reporting contractwith TRW, Chilton was the only national credit-reporting agency in Hawaii.In 1981, Chilton had been in business in Hawaii for a considerable periodof time. It had developed a mature credit file. In large part, Chilton'sfile development and market position were possible because of Chilton'sacquisition of the former Credit Bureau of Hawaii in the 1970's. When CDH began operations, it was able to compete with Chilton only becauseof its relationship with TRW. Potential customers had no reason to tapthe meager Hawaii file of CDH unless they sought the large mainland fileof TRW. Most important, TRW had and has significant files in the west coast.Because so many Californians relocate to Hawaii, credit customers soughtaccess to the CDH/TW files. After nearly eight years of developing its Hawaii credit information, CDHnow has a mature file. Nonetheless, Chilton still maintains a more comprehensivelocal file. When customers seek <T3>only</T3> local credit information, Chilton still maintains a competitiveedge over CDH. CDH remains able to compete largely because of the strengthof the TRW file behind it. The continued affiliation between TRW and CDHhas enabled CDH to obtain roughly 30% to 35% of the market. 4. Effect of the Final Judgment The Complaint alleges: ``There are <T3>two</T3> credit bureaus that collect information for and sell fullfile consumer credit reports on individuals who reside in Hawaii. Basedon the number of consumer credit reports sold, Chilton's owned office isthe largest credit bureau and TRW's affiliate is the second largest.''(Complaint, andpara; 24.)  The proposed consent judgment requires TRW to terminate its contract withCDH. According to the economic impact statement: Termination of the affiliation agreements will ensure that the acquisitionwill have no effect on competition in the relevant geographic markets wherethe affiliates operate because affiliates will be free to enter into affiliationagreements with vendors other than TRW or Chilton. The terminated affiliateswill have strong financial incentives to enter into new contractual relationshipswith a credit information data base service not fully represented in thelocal market. As a result, the number of competitors and their local marketpositions will remain substantially unchanged.  We respectfully submit that this view is misguided at the least and disingenuousat worst. It displays fundamental misunderstandings as to the nature ofthe credit reporting system in Hawaii. First, the competitive impact statement concludes that there will be <T3>no effect on competition</T3> because the affiliates will be free toenter into affiliation agreements with other vendors. The conclusion thatthere will be no effect on competition presupposes two things: 1) not onlywill CDH be able to sell its file to or contract with another potentialcompetitor, but also 2) that CDH acting along or with one of the remainingpotential competitors will be able to maintain the same market share thatCDH/TRW now enjoys. Neither of these suppostions is well-founded. While the two remaining potential competitors in Hawaii might be willingto purchase CDH's file, there is no assurance it can be sold. Right now,absent a TRW/Chilton merger, CDH has the right to enter affiliation agreementswith any of the four competitors or potential competitors in Hawai. Ifthe consent judgment becomes effective, TRW will have to terminate itsagreement with CDH and will be prohibited from entering into an agreementwith CDH for a period of 5 years. Chilton will no longer exist. Thus, insteadof four competitors or potential competitors in Hawaii with whom CDH couldcontract, there remain at most two. At least one of the last competitorshas a fledgling Hawaii file. It might not be advantageous to affiliatewith CDH. Moreover, the remaining potential competitors might not havethe interest in purchasing a file unless they are certain that the filecan compete with the new TRW/Chilton file. Even a cursory review of the market forces in Hawaii demonstrate the fallacyin the assumption that CDH will be able to successfully compete with thejoint TRW/Chilton. As set forth above, the success CDH has enjoyed in therecent past is a direct result of its relationship with TRW. CDH's lessmature and less complete Hawaii file has been able to complete with Chiltonbecause of TRW's west coast file. Certain customers now choose CDH/TRWbecause of its mainland files. If CDH no longer has the TRW files to support it, it will be faced withattempting to compete head-to-head with the more established, more completeChilton local file. If the TRW/Chilton merger goes through, the resultfor CDH will be even more devastating. A customer will now have the choicebetween a more mature Hawaii file (Chilton) coupled with a vast mainlandfile (TRW) or a young Hawaii file (CDH) possibly coupled with a weakermainland file. To suggest that CDH once it is cut adrift, will retain thesame market share as CDH/TRW, is naive. To make matters worse, CDH/TRW now markets its services under the nameof ``TRW.'' Customers and potential customers are currently faced withthe choice between Chilton or TRW. As stated above, credit grantors (orCDH customers) usually receive consumer credit reports electronically throughcomputer terminals. In Hawaii, most credit grantors have been providedwith terminals through which they may gain access to the credit bureaus.All new terminals are currently equipped with a number of buttons includingone for Chilton and one for TRW. The name ``CDH'' does not appear on thecomputer terminals. Nor does it appear on the consumer credit report orthe invoice. As far as most customers are concerned, TRW works alone. Afterthe TRW/Chilton merger, many customers will not even know that the entitythat was supplying the information under the TRW name is now independentor associated with another company.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ CDH will even be prevented from using the name ``CDH''once the affiliation contract is terminated. The inevitable result is that whatever market share CDH/TRW had will <T3>not </T3>simply shift to CDH with its new affiliate. It is far morelikely that TRW will retain its share and add that to the Chilton marketshare.5. HHI In its Complaint, the Department stated that in 16 relevant markets (includingHawaii) the proposed acquisition would substantially increase concentration.The HHI, it reports, is currently greater than 3,200 and the acquisitionof Chilton would increase the HHI by more than 700 points. (Complaint andpara;20.) In fact, based on the allegations in the Complaint, the HHI in Hawaii wouldbe closer to 5,200.\2\<NOTE/> CDH takes the position that the HHI is really somewhere inexcess of 4,300.\3\<NOTE/> Whatever figure is used, the market is considered highlyconcentrated based on the 1984 Department of Justice Merger Guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ This assumes that there are only two competitors in Hawaiiwith the following market shares: TRW_40 percent; Chilton_60 percent. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Assuming TRW/CDH has a 35 percent share; Chilton has 55percent and one or two others have 10 percent. The increase in the HHI could be almost 4,000 if TRW and Chilton mergein Hawaii without limitation. Even with the ordered termination of theaffiliation agreement between TRW and CDH, the HHI would undoubtedly rise.Assuming that TRW/CDH has a market share of 35 percent, Chilton has a 55percent share and a third competitor has a 10 percent share, the HHI is4,350. If CDH affiliated with the third competitor and kept its entiremarket share the HHI would rise by 700 points. What is more likely, CDHmight retain only a portion of its market share (<T3>e.g., </T3>20 percent) and TRW retain part (<T3>e.g., </T3>15 percent). That would leave TRW/Chilton with a 70 percentshare and CDH with a 30 percent share. The resulting HHI would be 5,800or an increase of 1,450. (As set forth above, it is unlikely that CDH wouldbe able to retain a large market share without its TRW affiliation. Thesmaller CDH's share, the larger the HHI.)According to the 1984 Merger Guidelines, The Department is likely to challenge mergers in this region [above 1,800]that produce an increase in the HHI of more than 50 points, unless theDepartment concludes . . .  that the merger is not likely substantiallyto lessen competition. However, if the increase in the HHI exceeds 100and the post-merger HHI substantially exceeds 1,800, <T3>only in extraordinary cases will such factors establish that the mergeris not likely substantially to lessen competition. </T3>The merger of TRW and Chilton in Hawaii would result in a post-merger HHI<T3>substantially </T3>in excess of 1,800. The increase in the HHI wouldin all likelihood far exceed 100.\4\<NOTE/> The Department cannot establish that the merger is not likelysubstantially to lessen competition. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Only if there are only two competitors in Hawaii and CDHretains its entire market share would the HHI remain the same. The factors affecting the significance of market shares and concentrationdo not change the result. For example, this is not a market in which thereare changing market conditions, nor is there ease of entry. Accordingly,the Department should have to show what extraordinary circumstances existin Hawaii to allow competition to remain. 6. The Consent Decree Should Not Be Approved Until The Department And TRWDemonstrate That CDH Can Remain a Viable CompetitorTo fulfill its obligations under the Antitrust Penalties and ProceduresAct, 15 U.S.C. andSection;16(e), the court must consider whether the publicinterest will be served by sanctioning a merger of the only two competitorsin the consumer credit market in Hawaii. In support of the Consent Decree,the Department concluded that by ordering TRW to discontinue its affiliationwith CDH, the competitive environment would remain unaltered. As set forthabove, that is not the case. In <T3>United States v. National Broadcasting Co., Inc.</T3>, 449 F. Supp.1127 (C.D. Cal. 1978), the court, in approving a proposed consent judgmentstated, ``in evaluating a proposed consent decree, one highly significantfactor is the degree to which the proposed decree advances and is consistentwith the government's original prayer for relief.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 1144. The court concluded that the ``relief provided bythe judgment is consistent with the government's general theory of liabilityas manifested in its complaint.'' <T3>Id </T3>at 1145. As a result, the court held ``that the consent judgment,on balance, advances and is in the public interest.'' <T3>Id. </T3>In this case, the government's original prayer for relief sought to enjointhe merger in order to protect competition. Thus, the court must determinewhether the Consent Decree is consistent with that original prayer forrelief. Since the effect of the Consent Decree is likely to substantiallylessen competition, it should not be approved. The Competitive Impact Statement fails to explain why other options werenot considered with respect to the Hawaii market. Since CDH, without accessto the TRW, files will have difficulty competing with TRW/Chilton, merelyrequiring TRW to terminate its contract with CDH will not result in continuedcompetition in this state. In certain areas, the Consent Decree requiresthat TRW sell a copy of either the file it now owns or a copy of the fileit will acquire from Chilton to one of the other companies providing networkservices. The Competitive Impact Statement states that the Department consideredbut rejected the option of refusing to allow TRW to retain a copy of theconsumer credit files that it must sell. It rejected this option claimingthat if TRW can retain a copy of both the Chilton and TRW consumer creditfiles it can provide consumers with a higher quality product. However,that is basically the reason that competitors such as CDH will be unableto compete in the market. The Department also considered and rejected requiring TRW to sell copiesof the combined TRW/Chilton consumer credit files. The Department rejectedthis alternative because it believed that a copy of either firm's fullfile would be sufficient to enable the new firm to compete effectivelyin the relevant market. The reasons for rejecting this option were notwell thought out. The Competitive Impact Statement stated, ``The new firmwill have all the credit information previously owned by one of the leadingcompetitors in the market.'' As stated above, in Hawaii, that is not thecase. If CDH is coupled with another competitor, CDH will have only thelocal component of its TRW/CDH files, whereas TRW/Chilton will have boththe more mature Chilton files and the strong Chilton/TRW mainland files.CDH or others will remain unable to compete against these joint files.There were other alternatives which the Department failed to accept. Sincethe Consent Decree as proposed by TRW and the Department will likely reducecompetition in the state of Hawaii, the Consent Decree should not be approved.If you have any questions about the foregoing or would like to discussit with CDH, please do not hesitate to contact this office. <ITAG tagnum="21">  Very truly yours, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Margery S.

Neither of these firms is a party to the action which youhave brought against TRW and neither of these firms has committed any offenseunder the laws of the United States. Yet, remarkably, they bear the burdenof the relief sought by the proposed final judgment. I suggest that thereis no precedent in case law or in the practice of the Antitrust Divisionfor this result and it is manifestly unjust.This matter arises out of the proposed acquisition of Chilton Corporationby TRW. The United States has filed a complaint under section 7 of theClayton Act contending that the acquisition is unlawful in that it wouldlessen competition in the sale of consumer credit reports. The AntitrustDivision has apparently negotiated a decree with TRW under which the Divisionwould agree that the acquisition may be consummated. Although the decreeor proposed final judgment drastically affects our clients, they have neverbeen consulted by representatives of the Government. Indeed, so far asI know, they have never even been contacted.The proposed final judgment reflects an assumption that there is particularconcentration in certain defined geographic markets and that in these markets,TRW must agree to terminate existing affiliates. Credit Data of CentralMassachusetts and Credit Data of Rhode Island are two such affiliates andthey have been informed by TRW that their agreements will not be extendedand will terminate on their respective anniversary dates in May and Julyof this year. I quote from a letter dated November 14, 1988 from TRW toCredit Data of Central Massachusetts (a copy of the full letter is attached):``As I am sure you know, TRW is in the process of acquiring Chilton Corporation.Because of the size of the transaction, approval of the Department of Justicewas required. As part of that approval process, we will be required toterminate our Computerized Credit Reporting Services Agreement made andentered into as of July 12, 1983 (``Agreement).''It is just not right for such harm to be visited on an innocent party.We object to the inclusion in the proposed final judgment of provisionsthat require the severance of relationships between our clients and TRW.These provisions call for the destruction of our clients' existing businessrelationships and the harm is real and immediate.Our clients have limited resources. Therefore, we request that you makeour comments available to the Court before which this action is pending.We do not believe that a Court would find the proposed final judgment inits present form to be in the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="21">  Very truly yours,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William L.

(hereinafter referred to as ``CCRC'') which hasoffices in the Central Texas area and its principal place of business being807 North 2nd Street, Killeen, Texas. This letter is being sent pursuantto the provisions of 15 U.S.C. Sec. 16(d) and is intended to be a commenton the proposed consent judgment submitted in cause no. C88-4253, styledUnited States of America vs. TRW, Inc. filed in the District Court forthe Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division. The substance of this letter is to notify the Justice Department and allparties concerned in the TRW acquisition of Chilton that the consent judgmentas presently written contains errors in that it authorizes TRW to sellor transfer to Trans Union Credit Information Co. credit file informationcontained in the affected zip code areas which TRW does not have authorityto sell or transfer. Therefore, CCRC is seeking to have the United Stateswithdraw its consent to the judgment as presently written or in the alternativeCCRC is seeking a modification of the consent judgment as presently writtento eliminate the problems with the zip code regions affected by the agreementbetween TRW and CCRC. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background Regarding Relationship Between TRW andamp; CCRC </ITAG>On July 7, 1987, CCRC and TRW entered into a computerized credit reportingservice agreement for an initial term of five years. Pursuant to the termsof the agreement, there were a series of zip codes which were designatedto be CCRC's data base. This data base included all of the credit informationand records stored in the TRW system, no matter how or by whom collectedwhich had a current address within the CCRC designated zip code area. Acopy of those zip codes are attached as Exhibit One. Thiere also may beother zip codes affected by subsequent amendments to the agreement betweenCCRC and TRW. By virture of the agreement entered into by CCRC and TRW, the credit informationcontained in the designated zip code areas became the property of CCRC.The agreement specifically provides that ``CCRC's data base shall be theproperty of CCRC . . .''. CCRC essentially bought TRW's corporate filesfor the affected regions. Since the date of the agreement, CCRC has continuallyupdated and enhanced the credit information contained in the files forthose zip code areas. This process has resulted in the expenditure of agreat deal of manpower hours and expense on the part of CCRC. The agreement further provides that TRW may purchase on an inquiry by inquirybasis the credit information contained in CCRC's data base. Likewise, CCRCmay purchase on an inquiry by inquiry basis the credit information containedin the TRW data base. By virtue of this provision in the agreement, theparties recognize that each party owns the information contained in therespective data bases as separate and independent property. The agreement also provides that the relationship between CCRC and TRWcreated by the agreement is not to be interpreted as a joint venture, partnership,or principal/agent relationship. Neither party has the right or authorityto act for, or to assume, create or incur any obligation, liability, orresponsibility of any kind, whether expressed or implied, against, in thename of or on behalf of, the other party. <ITAG tagnum="84">Effect of Consent Judgment on CCRC </ITAG>Paragraph V (A)(1) of the consent judgment provides that TRW has enteredinto an agreement to sell a copy of the consumer credit files for the geographicareas identified in attachment II of the consent judgment. More specifically,TRW has entered into a credit file sale agreement with Trans Union CreditInformation Co. to sell zip code areas which are the subject of this commentletter. Those areas include some of the zip code areas which are designatedCCRC data base information in the agreement between CCRC and TRW. A comparisonof the zip codes designated as CCRC's data base in the agreement betweenTRW and CCRC and the zip code areas listed in attachment II of the consentdecree reveals that at least the following zip codes are affected: 78626, 76500, 76529, 76531 through 76532, 76555 through 76556, 76575, 76581through 76620, 76629, 76688, 76700. There may also be other zip codes which could be affected by virtue ofamendments to the agreement entered into between CCRC and TRW.The competitive impact statement notes that TRW has entered into agreementsto sell a copy of the file it <T3>owns </T3>to one of the other companies providing network services.Simply put, TRW has agreed to sell zip codes/data base information to acompetitor of CCRC which it has no authority to sell. It has not askedfor nor received CCRC's permission to sell such information.Obviously, the sale of such information to a competitor of CCRC could havea direct and devastating effect on CCRC's operations. As noted throughoutthe competitive impact statement and consent judgment, the credit informationcontained in the credit files is extremely important in the day to daybusiness of companies in the credit retrieval information business.It is CCRC's position that the purpose of the proposed final judgment isto do what is in the public's best interest. Certainly it cannot be saidthat it is in the public's best interest to permit TRW to transfer propertywhich rightfully belongs to CCRC and sell it to a competitor of CCRC. Oncethis credit data has been transferred and assimilated into a competitor'sfile, it may be virtually irretrievable and the damage sustained by CCRCcould be devastating.Therefore, CCRC would request that the United States withdraw its consentto the consent judgment in cause no. C88-4253, United States of Americavs. TRW, Inc. or in the alternative, that the United States recommend amodification of the consent decree to eliminate the problems expressedin this comment letter.CCRC is willing to provide any further information which United StatesJustice Department feels is necessary to adequately review this consentjudgment including, but not limited to, the agreement entered into withTRW.

TRW, Inc., </T3>Consent DecreeDear Mr. Grossman: It has been called to my attention that the arrangementscalled for by the proposed consent decree in the referenced case couldhave an adverse, anticompetitive effect upon certain independent creditbureaus. In particular, the decree's requirement that Credit Bureau Servicesof New Hampshire terminate its arrangements for purchasing data processingand network services from Chilton Corporation (which would be acquiredby TRW if the acquisition is approved) may unfairly deprive CBS-NH of thecapacity to compete effectively.I am concerned that the consent decree may inadvertently impose unwarrantedand ultimately anticompetitive restrictions on CBS-NH. This would be unfairinasmuch as CBS-NH is not engaged in, or about to engage in, any anticompetitiveactivity or arrangements which are alleged to violate the antitrust lawsin the Department's complaint.As I understand the facts, the decree would hinder independent credit bureauslike CBS-NH from providing full-service credit reporting to credit grantors.While the decree bars CBS-NH from access to the data processing and networkingservices it now obtains from Chilton, other sources of equivalent servicesare not readily available. As a result, CBS-NH stands to lose a sizeableportion of the wholesale sub-market it now services as an independent bureau.In proposing arrangements to accommodate TRW's acquisition of Chilton,it seems counterproductive to impose restrictions which curtail the abilityof independent credit bureaus like CBS-NH to compete effectively with creditbureaus wholly-owned by TRW and other large vendors.I hope that the Department will give careful consideration to these concerns,as more fully expressed in the comments filed by CBS-NH in its submissionto you dated January 18, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21">  Sincerely,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Gordon J.
