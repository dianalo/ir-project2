Chairman L.William Seidman told delegates to the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions' 96th annual convention.   In remarks to reporters after his speech on Monday, Seidmansaid, ``I strongly oppose the banks having to pay for the problemsof the thrift industry'' and that banks prefer ``to go it alone''with their own insurance fund.   However, he did not rule out merging the two regulatory systems,provided insurance costs were kept separate. He said the FDIC couldhelp thrifts by providing use of its credit.   At midyear, 497 of the 3,096 U.S. savings associations wereinsolvent, while another 408 were losing money. Regulators estimateit will cost $45 billion to $50 billion to clean up the mess, andthe Sandamp;Ls say they can't pay for the cleanup without help fromCongress.   In contrast, Seidman said the FDIC fund, although it will sufferits first loss ever, is sound. It had $16.3 billion at the end ofSeptember and should shrink to between $15 billion and $16 billionby years's end, before growing by about $500 million next year, hesaid.   Seidman said bank failures should decline from a post-Depressionrecord topping 200 this year to between 175 and 200 next year.There are no more ``megabank failures on the horizon'' next year,he said.   Theo H. Pitt Jr., chairman of Pioneer Savings Bank in RockyMount, N.C., and outgoing chairman of the Sandamp;L industry's tradegroup, said the organization will fight next year to preserve aseparate regulatory system, arguing that it is crucial to theAmerican home buyer.   Seidman said Americans appear to want a separate Sandamp;L system andgovernment probably will preserve one, but, he said, ``I don'tthink the world would necessarily come to an end if there were nothrifts.''   Pitt, opening the first day of a four-day convention, saidbungled deregulation by the Reagan administration bankrupted theFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.   ``We've had our troubles, but you know how we got there: as aresult of ill-timed, poorly executed, ill-conceived deregulation,''Pitt said.   ``The regulators let some real sharpies slip into the system,high fliers who looked upon their institutions as personal piggybanks to serve their own irresponsible, sometimes criminal ends,''he said.   Pitt said the industry has spent $4.5 billion in extra paymentsto its insurance fund, can spend no more than an additional $3billion, and should not be forced to contribute more because thecrisis was not of its making.   However, H. Joe Selby, former director of regulatory affairs inthe Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which oversees some of themost troubled savings institutions in the country, disputed Pitt'saccount.   ``My God, the thrift industry has fought and fought and foughtregulation,'' Selby said in an interview. ``They want to have theircake and eat it both.''   Selby, who now operates a consulting firm in Dallas, TheInsignia Company, said, ``They wanted deregulation. They gotderegulation. They didn't want supervised deregulation, and theydidn't get supervised deregulation.''   Pitt, outlining a part of the trade group's legislative strategyfor next year, said the industry will push for regulatory reform aspart of a package providing new money to the FSLIC.   Among the reforms he mentioned were: tighter restrictions on Sandamp;Linvestments in junk bonds and in commercial real estate projects,limits on the availability of high-priced brokered deposits,greater power for regulators to block the creation of new Sandamp;Ls orthe transfer of ownership of existing institutions, and limits ongrowth tied to the amount of capital an institution can raise fromprivate investors.</TEXT></DOC>
