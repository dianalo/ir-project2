In 1977, the Soviet Union began to deploy SS-20 missiles as part of its efforts to alter fundamentally the European military balance and to intimidate our European allies. In the so-called &quot;two-track&quot; decision of 1979, NATO resolved to counter this deployment in the event that the Soviet Union could not be persuaded to withdraw and dismantle these weapons. Given the anti-nuclear sentiment prevalent at the time, the Soviet Union fully expected to garner, through public pressure on the Western democracies, what it found it could not gain from U.S. negotiators: the unopposed dominance of Europe by Soviet Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) and the ensuing political benefits their deployment would bring. To this end, the Soviets refused to negotiate and, when NATO deployments courageously began in 1983 against a withering storm of Soviet propaganda, the Soviet Union walked out of negotiations.    Since 1983, Soviet propaganda has repeatedly made three points regarding the deployment of Pershing-2 and ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe. First, despite the evidence to the contrary, the Soviets charged that the Pershing and the cruise missiles were not designed for the defense of Europe, but were instead designed for a &quot;first strike&quot; against the Soviet Union. Second, they claimed that the introduction of U.S. missiles would &quot;make the situation in Europe much more unstable and explosive.&quot; And, third, they argued that the deployment of the NATO systems removed all possibility of an agreement on the reduction of intermediate-range nuclear forces.    The fact that our resolve in seeing NATO's two-track decision through has brought us within sight of the elimination of all the offending missiles, SS-20s and other Soviet missiles as well, gives the lie to these Soviet charges.    It is worth noting, however, that the basic themes of the Soviet attack on the NATO/INF decision have since been pressed into service for the current campaign against the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Indeed, after claiming from 1979 to 1983 that NATO's intermediate-range missile decision would eliminate the prospect for a negotiated outcome, Dr. Georgi Arbatov said of SDI in April 1983, &quot;I think it (SDI) will absolutely derail the whole process of arms control. It will become simply impossible.&quot;    We would do well to remember that what was not true about NATO's decision to defend itself against the threat of Soviet INF missiles is equally not true about the president's dream of deploying a reliable method of defending ourselves against Soviet Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs).    In repeating the charge that any Western effort at defense is a threat to world peace, the Soviet Union is employing the old dodge that attempts to extort unilateral concessions from the democracies. If the NATO governments had shared the naivete of the European opponents of NATO's 1979 decision, it is certain that the SS-20s would by now have a permanent place in the landscape of Europe. Similarly, if the U.S. Congress persists in its program of preemptive concessions to Soviet propaganda on SDI, the threat of Soviet first strike and first deployment of their own defensive systems will bedevil our foreign policies and curtail our freedoms for generations to come.    The U.S. forgets at its peril what is needed to conclude a meaningful and verifiable agreement with the Soviet Union. What is needed is realism concerning both the requirements of Western security and the nature of the Soviet state. Next in importance after Moscow's tactical negotiating games as the greatest obstacles to meaningful agreements are the West's enthusiasm for signing almost any contract with the Soviet Union, the false belief that the U.S.S.R. has &quot;ceased&quot; to become a threat because it is making some effort to respond to its own internal economic difficulties, and the moral credulity it takes to believe that the defense of the U.S. and our allies is a threat to anyone.    ---   Mr. Weinberger is secretary of defense. </TEXT></DOC>
