Mr. Watkins said in an interview that he will seek, in the next Bush administration budget request, to keep the programs running at levels &quot;not unlike that which eventually has been negotiated each year with Congress.&quot;    Mr. Reagan sought cuts in the alternative-energy field through most of his presidency. Congress traditionally rejected those cuts. Mr. Bush didn't change the Reagan request in his first budget.    &quot;We in the Department of Energy have short-changed very legitimate areas of increased emphasis in those programs,&quot; Mr. Watkins said. He said the administration will increase its request for the programs during the next two years &quot;to something we all agree makes sense.&quot;    Mr. Bush's fiscal-1990 budget request, identical to Mr. Reagan's, sought $112.4 million for research into technologies such as solar, wind and geothermal, a decrease from Congress's fiscal-1989 appropriation of $149 million. For energy-conservation research and grants, Mr. Bush requested $96 million, far below Congress's fiscal-1989 funding level of $373 million. </TEXT></DOC>
