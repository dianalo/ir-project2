But the magazine itself, and its parent company, McGraw-Hill Inc., aren't likely to be held liable either criminally or civilly as a result of such trading.    In the Business Week case now under investigation, at least one Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. broker is believed to have traded on information supplied by workers at an R.R. Donnelley andamp; Sons Co. printing plant in Old Saybrook, Conn., where the magazine is printed.    According to lawyers who have worked on insider trading-related matters, any employee of the printing company who provided advance information about the articles could be indicted on wire fraud and mail fraud charges. The same charges could be brought against anyone who traded on this information.    The printers and the broker also could be charged with violations of the securities fraud statutes under the &quot;misappropriation doctrine.&quot; This judge-made doctrine, affirmed repeatedly by federal courts, prohibits the use of stolen or misappropriated confidential information for use in trading securities.    These are the same charges that were brought against former Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans and two co-conspirators in 1984. Mr. Winans, a former writer of the Journal's &quot;Heard on the Street&quot; stock market column, leaked advance information, usually from pay phones, about the timing and the content of those columns to a former Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. stockbroker. The broker traded on the stocks, agreeing to give Mr. Winans a part of the profits.    The U.S. Supreme Court decision in the Winans case set out the law that will govern any criminal cases resulting from the Business Week inquiry. The high court held that Mr. Winans had violated mail fraud and wire fraud statutes, but the justices split, 4-4, on whether Mr. Winans violated securities fraud statutes. However, the split vote left standing Mr. Winans's conviction and left intact lower-court rulings adopting the misappropriation doctrine.    Business Week is not under any legal obligation to protect the contents of its weekly publication prior to distribution to the public on Friday mornings. But the magazine has a strongly worded policy that prohibits the advance disclosure of articles by employees.    So, too, does Chicago-based Donnelly, which has a contract with Business Week. &quot;Our policy is that material that comes from customers is the property of customers, not ours,&quot; said a Donnelly spokesman. Employees &quot;must maintain strict confidentiality and they all know that,&quot; he added.    Because Donnelly and Business Week neither promoted nor encouraged illicit trading based on advance publication of articles, both are not likely to be held liable. But there is good reason to believe that charges will be brought against those who effected the trades and passed on the information.    &quot;If the print shop has a policy of confidentiality and if the magazine has a policy against premature disclosure, then anyone who takes information and knowingly or recklessly makes it available to a broker who profits on it is liable&quot; on grounds of misappropriation, wire fraud and mail fraud, said John F. Olson, a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the law firm of Gibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher.    If suspicious trading had happened only once, &quot;It could be the case that a printer was dumb or careless and a broker didn't have any idea the printer was breaching his duty,&quot; he said. &quot;But when it occurs repeatedly, there is a lot of circumstantial evidence that the person passing information is motivated by the receipt of something of value.&quot;    Indeed, as Mr. Olson and others point out, even if the printers didn't receive money or gifts for the information they may have given to one or more stock brokers, they may still be held liable if they knew what they were doing was prohibited.    The most famous insider-trading case involving a printer was the 1978 conviction of Vincent Chiarella, a New York financial printer. Mr. Chiarella made about $29,000 trading on information gleaned from tender-offer documents he viewed in the course of his job. But his conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court in 1980. Attorneys say the outcome in his case won't dictate the result in the Business Week situation because the courts have toughened their stance toward insider trading since Chiarella.    Government investigators would have an easy time bringing mail fraud charges against those who gave or traded on the Business Week information. &quot;Business Week is sent through the mails,&quot; said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University Law School. That, he said, is enough basis to prosecute.    Even if the broker obtained the information in a face-to-face meeting, he would have had to execute the trades by telephone, constituting wire fraud, legal experts say.    In addition, New York or Connecticut could bring charges on &quot;grounds of theft of property,&quot; said Stanley Arkin, a New York attorney.    It is extremely difficult, lawyers say, for any publication to prevent the abuse of information it considers confidential. &quot;In the printing of a magazine, it's almost impossible to have absolute security,&quot; Mr. Olson said. Business Week goes to press at midnight Wednesday and doesn't get distributed until Friday, leaving an entire 24-hour period between publication and distribution.    ---   Stephen J.
