<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-0197 </DOCNO><TEXT>The vibration spectrum of the Cs/sub 4/[H/sub 2/V/sub 10/O/sub 28/]x4H/sub2/O salt, which is the first example of a compound with an inorganiccation and a diprotanated decavanadate-anion, is considered. IR spectraof all decavanadates salts, which structures are determined, are givenfor comparison. Band assignment is made. For such a case literature dataon vibration spectra of vanadium(5) compounds containing different atomgroupings, which are close to the separated ones in decavanadate-ionby their geometric parameters,have been used. It is supposed that theabsorption band at 560 cm /sup -1/ in cesium decavanadate spectrum canbe related to antisymmetric stretching vibration of the protonated bridgeV-O-V grouping.</TEXT></DOC>
