 Three, if we can judgeby the recent International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco.andO;Whenever there was a question after one of the presentations on advancedintegrated circuit technology, the moderator would repeat and interpret thequestion for a translator, who, in turn, would re-interpret and translat itfor the speaker.andP;  This was followed by a short, whispered huddle betweenmoderator, translator, and presenter.andP;  Only then did we get an answer, orsometimes a request for clarification.andM;This ritual underscores the complex nature of semiconductor technology andthe difficulty that even experts have in communicating and understandingstate-of-the-art ideas.andP;  But it also highlights the globalization of anindustry that was born in the U.S.A.andP;  In the sessions we attended, about 80%of the papers were presented by speakers with English as a second -- or third-- language.andP;  It took only a glance at the audience to confirm that advancedsemiconductor technology is dominated by Asian engineers.andM;This geographic dispersion is nothing new, but it is seldom displayed sographically.andM;Overall, this year we came away from the annual ISSCC with no big message,although we do have some lesser observations to reflect on.andM;* APPEARANCE AND REALITY -- One is a caution against mistaking a rhetoricalconvenience for reality itself.andP;  Although we have long regarded the ISSCC asthe industry's most useful single mirror of technology trends (and are, infact, making such use of it once again in this letter), the conferencedoesn't always present an accurate reflection.andP;  We certainly wouldn't want touse it as evidence that U.S.andP;  IC technology is moribund.andM;For example, most of the advanced microprocessors described at ISSCC weredeveloped by computer systems houses such as Digital Equipment,Hewlett-Packard, and IBM.andP;  Notably absent were the premier microprocessorcompanies; the lone semiconductor company at the microprocessor session wasSignetics, which of course is now part of Philips, one of the biggestelectronics companies in the world.andP;  In addition, there were few papers fromyoung, private companies.andP;  Should those of us who believe in the power ofentrepreneurship and venture capital be worried?andP;  Not necessarily.andO;Venture-backed startups, we think, are becoming more reluctant to share theirengineering accomplishments.andM;* MICROS AND MINIS -- The papers from DEC, HP and IBM should remind those whoget carried away with the microcomputer revolution that the traditionalminicomputer companies also know how to make microprocessors.andP;  In theirattempt to displace minis, those who sell microbased systems benefit morefrom mass-market economics than from circuit technology.andP;  Because ofcost-sharing, it may be cheaper to let Intel or Motorola develop yourmicroprocessor, but it is possible to do the job yourself, and to do a goodjob of it.andP;  (Of course, you may have to be richer than Trump to afford it,and even then may be able to afford it no more than once.)andM;* IT'S ACADEMIC -- Although papers from U.S.andP;  sources outnumbered those fromabroad, almost a third of the American papers were sponsored or co-sponsoredby universities.andP;  University research has always been a handmaiden ofAmerican commercial technology, but we wonder how much equity the academicshave in the technology, and how companies can use technology to create aninternational competitive edge if they don't own the intellectual propertyoutright.andM;* GOOD IDEAS, TOO -- Much of the research on display came from largeinternational companies more noted for their manufacturing prowess thancreativity.andP;  The research makes it clear, however, that these companies alsoare capable of advanced research and development.andM;* NO DRIVER ABOARD -- Judging by the number of ISSCC papers devoted totelevision circuits, we'll soon need to learn a new acronym -- TVSP, fortelevision-specific processors.andP;  Most of the designs were dedicated to highdefinition TV, the current darling of Japanese and European technologists.andO;Indeed, the program committee thought HDTV important enough to merit atwo-hour evening panel session on the question, &quot;Is HDTV the Circuit Driverfor the 1990s?&quot;andP;  Who needs a panel for that?andP;  The answer is no.andP;  HDTV won'tdo much for IC demand until well after 2000, if then.andM;Color television, we recall, took about eight years after introduction forcumulative shipments to reach 1% market penetration.andP;  Since the first HDTVsets won't show up until 1993, 1% by 2000 seems right for HDTV, too.andP;  We andthe panelists agree that even after the turn of the century, HDTV won'tconsume integrated circuits the way that PCs do today.andM;Educated guesses are that by the year 2000, memory consumption for HDTV willrepresent about 5% of the total.andP;  If so, annual sales of such ICs couldamount to between $500 million and $1 billion.andP;  Big numbers, if you happen tobe selling memories, but paltry compared to the annual sales of memories forcomputers.andP;  Of course, by then it may be hard to tell the difference betweenPCs and TV's.andM;The operative word here is &quot;specific,&quot; and that's just what these chips willbe.andP;  HDTV will be a technology driver for digital signal processing circuits,but not for the off-the-shelf DSP chips that we know today.andP;  Tomorrow's DSPswill have to perform 2 billion to 3 billion operations per second in order todecode full-motion video in real time.andP;  Circuits to do that will be veryspecialized.andP;  In fact, most chips that are good for HDTV won't be good formuch else.andP;  That's much different from today, when the leading-edge circuitsare general-purpose and intended for use in many applications.andP;  So -- despitethe hype, and the self-serving calls for America to mount an Randamp;D offensive inthe area -- we don't look for a lot of technology spillover from HDTV.andM;There's a message here for everybody in the electronic systems business.andO;When state-of-the-art semiconductors were general-purpose building blocks --microprocessors, for example, and DRAMs -- you could count on someone else todevelop the critical components you needed.andP;  But high-performance in thefuture will come in the form of highly-integrated and specialized devicesthat won't be available at your neighborhood discounter and, in fact, mightnot solve your problem even if you could buy them.andM;That will raise the cost of goods and stretch development times for systemscompanies that rely on leading-edge circuitry for product differentiation.andM;* GOING IT ALONE -- Let's return to that Signetics paper mentioned earlier.andO;It discussed a novel circuit with two interesting departures from standardmicroprocessor architecture.andP;  And it demonstrates the lengths to whichsystems companies are going in their efforts not to be shut out of theprocessor market by the refusal of Intel and Motorola to license alternatesources for their lates CPU designs.andM;One Signetics departure was use of the so-called Harvard architecture.andP;  Longovershadowed by the so-called VonNeuman approach, the Harvard style ofseparating the data and instruction areas of memory is regaining popularity,especially with digital signal processors.andP;  It's more expensive and complexto design, but it provides faster performance.andM;The second Signetics departure is the use of VLIW (very long instructionword) architecture, the prowess of which has been well demonstrated byMultiflow Computer, the Branford, Conn., supercomputer builder.andP;  (Thetechnology originator was Mary Poppins who coined the famous VLIW&quot;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.&quot;)andM;The Signetics VLIW design -- 200 bits long in this case -- isn't all thatdifferent from the design of microprogrammable bit-slice microprocessors.andP;  Infact, through VLIW the Signetics part simply eliminates the logic circuitsthat other microprocessors need to translate 16-bit or 32-bitmicroinstructions into the longer pattern of bits that the microprocessorreally needs.andP;  What Signetics gains is faster operation.andP;  However, theprogram memory needs to be 200 bits wide instead of 16 bits or 32 bits, sothe system requires more memory chips.andP;  It's also harder to program andrequires some specialized software tools to help the programmer.andP;  You get ahot chip -- but you have to pay for it with good code and big RAM.andM;We offer the Signetics paper as a guide to the ways in which some companiesmay try to compete with Intel's i860, Motorola's 88000 or IBM's RIOS circuits-- assuming they choose not to license such competing products as thereduced-instruction-set designs from Sun Microsystems and MIPS ComputerSystems.andP;  The competitors will turn to RISC, instruction-level parallelismand VLIW for high-performance embedded controllers and perhaps even somegeneral-purpose devices.andM;But remember that VLIW and the other approaches involve software technology,too, as Intel's recent agreement with Multiflow suggests.andP;  As anarchitecture, for example, VLIW design is similar to the array andfloating-point processors that formed early the basis of Floating PointSystems and similar companies, which were good at finite-element analysis andimage analysis but not a nlot more because of programming difficulty.andP;  VLIWalso goes fast -- if you can program it.andM;* MOTIVATIONAL RESEARCH -- In a world of uncertainty, it's been some comfortto know that ICs, for the last decade or so, had at least an operatingvoltage in common.andM;But that's about to change as digital circuits move gradually to about 3volts from the present 5-volt level.andP;  In the interim, we'll have to contendwith two levels on the system board, raising costs and adding to designerconfusion.andM;Several ISSCC papers this year described circuits with reduced supply voltagerequirements, either 3.3 volts or 3.6 volts instead of the usual 5 volts.andM;From one side of the Pacific to the other, there was a difference inmotivation.andP;  American designers were urged on by limitations in the devicephysics at higher voltage levels -- by the need to lower operating voltagesas circuit dimensions shrink.andP;  Their Japanese counterparts, on the otherhand, worked on low voltage ICs out of need for portable computers.andP;  Japaneseresearch is inspired by a clear vision of future products.andP;  Japan isn'twaiting around, hoping for someone else to invent the semiconductors itneeds.andP;  Given that low-voltage papers have been showing up for two or threeyears now, look for the 5-volt power supply to be history by mid-decade.andP;  Atthe system level, we'll probably need 3 volts when the 64 megabit DRAMarrives.andP;  Until then, the prospect is for dual voltages.andP;  That means anotherpower supply voltage and maybe some circuits to synchronize the two.andP;  So, adda few dollars to the bill of materials and a few cents more for the testdepartment.andP;  We won't come face to face with this problem, however, for fiveor six years.andM;* OF BIPS, BOPS, AND TOPS -- Another transition in evidence at the conferencewas the move from measuring things in terms of millions to billions and eventrillions.andP;  Just when we were getting used to MIPS as a term of reference,the industry has moved on to BIPS or BOPS (billions of instructions persecond or billions of operations per second).andP;  Or, for the technical purist,GOPS -- giga operations per second.andP;  We even hears mention of TOPS (teraoperations per second), which tells you what some engineers fantasize about.andM;We won't have to worry about anything that fast for a while.andP;  Probably by theend of this year we'll see specialized circuits, such as those for HDTV, thatwork in the billions of operations per second range.andP;  But those operationswill be far simpler than the execution of a computer instruction -- at leastfor a while.andM;* SOMETHING WILL TURN UP -- Another mind-stretcher was an evening panelsession devoted to chip architectures using a billion transistors.andP;  There isno doubt that the technology to do that will be possible by the year 2000.andO;The real question is, &quot;What do you do with a billion transistors?&quot;andP;  And theanswer is...andP;  Well, no one seemed to know.andP;  Unfortunately, the discussiongravitated toward technical details of how to accomplish the technology, nothow to use it.andM;Again, we were dismayed at the lack of clear vision of how (or why) to deployRandamp;D.andP;  Most of the panel agreed that the first application of a billiontransistors will be a large memory subsystem.andP;  That doesn't require muchvision.andP;  Beyond that, the panel didn't get very far.andP;  In fact, a member ofthe audience chided the panelists for not really stretching to find creativeapplications.andP;  Panelists talked a lot about clusters of processors andprocessors that are distributed in memory, but those ideas only confirmed theextent to which visions of the future are constrained by presentday dayarchitectures.andM;* THINKING WITH SILICON -- Actually, the best use for a billion transistorsmay have emerged at an earlier session, where ATandamp;T Bell Laboratoriespresented a paper titled, &quot;A Reconfigurable CMOS Neural Network.&quot;andP;  Thatdevice uses 412,000 transistors to emulate 256 neurons in the biologicalswitching that accompanies thought.andP;  A billion-transistor chip would containmore than 2,400 neural nets of this type, equivalent to 600,000 neurons.andP;  Ifsuch circuits do, in fact, learn on their own as their advocates contend,they would greatly improve the ability of mere computers to cope with suchreal-world tasks as pattern recognition, voice recognition, and characterrecognition.andM;We think neural nets will become important within the next five to sevenyears.andP;  Developments in hardware are coming along nicely, as the Bell Labschip suggests.andP;  But the software is a different story.andP;  Not only will we haveto develop new ways of thinking about solutions to these problems, but theproblems themselves will have to be redefined.andP;  We hope the next ISSCC weattend devotes equal time to those issues.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
