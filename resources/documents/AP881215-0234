His recent speeches underscore his resistance to change. He hasadhered to a strict constructionist viewpoint with only minorvariations since that New Year's day three decades ago when hetoppled a discredited dictator and proceeded to turn Cuba upsidedown.   While the Soviet Union and other communist countries try toovercome economic stagnation by borrowing some capitalist practices,Castro remains a no-apologies defender of centralized planning andstate domination of the economy.   Some analysts even foresee the possibility of the first seriousSoviet-Cuban rift since the two countries became devoted allies in1968.   The Soviets are clearly displeased with what they regard as Cubanmisuse of economic aid, which has averaged about $5 billion annuallyin recent years.   In a recent article, the Soviet newspaper Pravda blamed Cuba for``serious imperfections'' at Soviet-backed industrial projects inCuba.   Castro, meanwhile, makes no attempt to conceal his disdain forSoviet reforms. Cuba, he has said, ``must watch over the ideologicalpurity of the revolution. ... That is why we cannot use any methodsthat reek of capitalism.''   He acknowledged recently that his country's future is somewhatmore uncertain as a result of the Kremlin's philosophical shift.   ``We can expect difficulties that may come from the enemy camp(the United States) and difficulties that may come from the camp ofour own friends,'' he said.   In 1986, at about the time Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachevbegan moving toward capitalist-style reforms, Castro shut down asix-year experiment involving the sale by farmers of their produceat market rates. He was afraid that a spreading capitalist mentalityand a high-income elite might take hold.   Most experts say Cuba is too valuable an ally for Moscow to cutadrift simply because of differing economic policies. Cuba providesimportant political support for Moscow and is widely admiredthroughout much of Africa and Latin America.   Cuba also serves as an indispensable base for Soviet monitoringof U.S. military and space activities. At one facility alone, 2,100Soviet technicians engage in intercepts of U.S. communications,according to American officials.   Castro had planned a huge welcome here for Gorbachev on Dec. 9but the visit was postponed on short notice because of theearthquake in Soviet Armenia.   Despite the apparent durability of Soviet-Cuban relations,Castro's unorthodox views have left him somewhat out of the Marxistmainstream.   While other countries look on material incentives for workers asa fact of life that must be accepted as the price for increasedproduction, Castro believes _ perhaps more firmly than before _ thatpeople should work not for personal gain but out of a sense ofpatriotic duty.   To the extent that Cuba is undergoing difficult economic times,Castro says the fault lies not with the system but with humanfrailty, the lack of revolutionary zeal. Whatever the reason, theCuban economy has been stagnant for more than two years.   Castro, of course, never has been one to follow the crowd. He hasspent a lifetime overcoming long odds.   In a recent speech, he recalled the time in December 1956 when,at the start of his guerrilla struggle, serious setbacks reduced hisforces to no more than a few devoted followers. Defeat seemedimminent.   ``Now we are millions,'' he said, using the analogy to underscorehis view that seemingly insurmountable obstacles can be overcomethrough patience and political will.   But as Castro himself has admitted, no challenge for him has beenmore difficult than bringing about economic wellbeing for hiscountrymen.   Food and clothing are strictly rationed and there is an acuteshortage of adequate housing. For transportation, Cubans must relyon buses that too often are overcrowded or make their rounds tooinfrequently. Cubans also complain about bureaucratic lethargy andpoor service generally, in restaurants and elsewhere.   The quality of life for the average Cuban, compared withdeveloped countries, is dreary although there appear to be fewdestitute Cubans. Many workers finds their jobs unfulfilling. Youthscomplain about a lack of recreational opportunities.   As an alternative to the drab government-controlled press, Cubansthese days snatch up Spanish-language Soviet magazines which have aquality Cuban publications lack: openness.   Ofelia Espinosa, who works at a local newsstand, said some Sovietweeklies are sold out in five minutes. ``Two years ago, we used tothrow them out,'' she said.   There is no overt persecution of Cubans who practice theirreligion but such people have little hope of rising to positions ofauthority. Christmas was officially abolished years ago because thecelebration interfered with the sugar harvest but there are signs ofa more flexible government attitude nowadays toward that occasion.   Some families say they are discreetly doing this year what wasunthinkable in previous years: putting up a Christmas tree.   While there is more tolerance for outspokenness than before,Cubans who make known their disdain for the system do so at theirown risk. Worker absenteeism has been a problem for all 30 Castroyears, a phenomenon that is not surprising in a country that claimsto guarantee a job for everybody.   Theft at state enterprises has been a major headache for theregime. On a secret tape that was smuggled out of Cuba, DefenseMinister Raul Castro said ``1 million police'' couldn't solve theproblem without stricter accounting controls.   In many professions, requirements of the state leave little roomfor creativity. A Cuban judge knows the judiciary is subservient tothe state. A journalist is aware that he must report within thenarrow boundaries imposed by party dogma.   Cuba also is viewed by the Reagan administration as a threat toU.S. interests because of its generous support for Nicaragua'sleftist government and aid to guerrilla groups elsewhere.   A related issue is the militarization of Cuban society. Cubaspends a higher percentage of its national budget on the militarythan all but a few countries worldwide.   According to U.S. figures, Cuba has 950 battle tanks comparedwith Canada's 114. Its military establishment is comparable to thatof Brazil, a country with a population 13 times the size of Cuba's.   Among nations that have embraced communism, Cuba appears to beone of the more successful. Several of the more recent converts toMarxism are wracked by civil war and poverty. In Cuba, there is lessabsolute poverty than in any country in Latin America, whereunemployment and underemployment rates run as high as 50 percent.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
