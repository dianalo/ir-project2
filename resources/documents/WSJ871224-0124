Having won with just 35% of the vote, he now outlines ambitious foreign and domestic policy programs aimed at winning over the majority of South Koreans who voted for the three opposition candidates. He says his goals after his Feb. 25 inauguration are nothing less than changing the country's authoritarian political tradition and working toward diplomatic breakthroughs with China and the Soviet Union, long-time backers of Communist North Korea and, with it, enemies of virulently anticommunist South Korea.    &quot;Some people are unhappy about the election outcome, but that unhappiness can be compensated by how I am going to perform,&quot; says Mr. Roh confidently in a wide-ranging interview, speaking in the soothing tones that did much during the campaign to reform his image as the former general who helped current President Chun Doo Hwan seize power in a 1979 coup. &quot;I am going to be the leader in eradicating my country's authoritarian political culture,&quot; he says.    Mr. Roh reiterated his promise, made late in the campaign, to seek a vote of confidence in a national referendum after the Summer Olympics scheduled to be held in Seoul next September. He was vague about when and how the referendum would be held, but has said he would resign if the vote went against him.    Mr. Roh sipped ginseng tea and spoke in the relaxed manner of a leader who sees many of his worst fears subsiding for the time-being. The street violence many feared would follow his election has been sporadic and is declining.    His main opposition foes, Kim Young Sam and Kim Dae Jung, haven't been able to convince most South Koreans that it was massive election fraud that gave Mr. Roh his victory, rather than the opposition's own inability to agree on a single candidate. The two Kims have begun to concentrate instead on next year's National Assembly elections -- a clear victory for Mr. Roh.    Mr. Roh gave few details of his ambitious plans. But he apparently will try to break away from the aloof and inflexible style of leadership of President Chun that gave rise to strong anti-government sentiments.    To change Korea's &quot;authoritarian culture,&quot; he says, he will begin with symbolic measures that appear trivial to the outside world but are revolutionary here. For example, he rejected the Cadillac limousine that comes with his office for a more modest South Korean sedan; he will allow citizens for the first time to walk on the street in front of the Blue House, Korea's executive mansion; and he will invite workers and &quot;common people&quot; to his inaugural.    He and his advisers are vague about the concrete measures to follow, but he stresses that a Commission on Democracy and Reconciliation, made up of Koreans from all walks of life, will provide suggestions to improve the country's human rights performance, to bring respected, neutral figures into the government, and to address festering wounds such as government corruption.    He plans to release many political prisoners. He says he will also &quot;restore the honor&quot; and pay reparations to the families of 200 Koreans killed in 1980 by government troops in the southern city of Kwangju during anti-government riots there. He says the government will also adhere to the new constitution's protection of individual rights, making more difficult the practice of holding people charged with political crimes for weeks without charge or access to lawyers and family.    Mr. Roh says he will try to broaden relations with China and the Soviet Union by capitalizing on their participation in the Olympic games and their interest in economic cooperation with Seoul. He said Beijing and Moscow will attend the &quot;boycott-free&quot; Seoul Olympics, though neither has officially accepted the invitation.    He says this could prepare the ground for significant improvements in relations with North Korea. &quot;They (North Korea) will have to adjust to new realities,&quot; he says. &quot;We can expect some significant changes.&quot;    But Mr. Roh's foreign-policy goals are secondary to undoing lingering domestic animosity toward his regime. He says he avoided rubbing salt into political wounds by ordering party members not to celebrate their triumph too openly.    &quot;When I heard the news that my election to the president had become a certainty, a momentous sense of responsibility overshadowed my joy.&quot; he says. &quot;I will humbly respect the opinion of the people who gave valuable support to the opposition candidates.&quot;    Mr. Roh recalls unfondly the election trail, where he became the target of eggs, tear gas and Molotov cocktails. &quot;Tell me if you know of another country where presidential candidates have to suffer such indignities,&quot; he says. Yet he says his stumping also provided him valuable lessons and insight into the problems caused by restricting political activity for so long.    &quot;I think the reason behind these outbursts is that we have concentrated on security and economic development while politics was neglected,&quot; he says. &quot;Then we lifted all the inhibitions last summer, and we saw an outburst of political desire. This trend will continue for a while.    &quot;But as time passes, people will settle down and become more sober-headed and begin to think more seriously about our future. What we have seen during this campaign was the natural growing pains as we mature as a country.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
