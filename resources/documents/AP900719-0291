(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A key figure in the collapse ofSilverado Savings andamp; Loan lives in a $1.9 million home despitetelling a congressional committee he was broke, a newspaperreported Wednesday.   Developer Bill L. Walters, 44, also is a former businessassociate of Neil Bush, President Bush's son and a former directorof Denver-based Silverado. Investigators say Walters' default on$106 million in real estate loans extended by Silverado contributedto the thrift's collapse.   A trust for Walters' wife, Jacqueline, purchased the $1.9million estate near Newport Bay for the couple in February,according to Orange County records reviewed by the Los AngelesTimes.   State records also show Mrs. Walters bought a mobile home onprime oceanfront property in Laguna Beach for $250,000, thenewspaper reported.   Federal regulators seized Silverado in December 1988. Itsfailure is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1 billion.   During a House Banking Committee hearing on Silverado's failure,Walters was asked last month about his financial condition.   ``I have a negative net worth,'' he testified.   Documents filed with the Orange County recorder's officeindicate the luxurious Newport Beach home was purchased by theWalters Trust I, of which Jacqueline Walters is the beneficiary.   The mobile home in the beachfront El Morro Beach Mobile HomePark also is listed in Mrs. Walters' name, the Times reported.   Walters could not be reached immediately for comment Wednesdayby The Associated Press. There was no public listing of Walters'residential and business telephone numbers.   He moved to Orange County five months ago to begin anew in thereal estate business, the Times said. But the Orange County Boardof Realtors said Wednesday he was not listed with the organization.   Congressmen reacted angrily at word of the home.   ``The government should immediately take action to file claimsagainst all of Mr. Walters' property so the taxpayers can get theirmoney back,'' said Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of theHousing Financial Institutions subcommittee.   ``This is what happens when the Bush administration doesn'taggressively go after those who cause the savings and loan fraud,''said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of a House paneloverseeing the industry bailout.   The Bill L. Walters Co. was one of Denver's largest developmentfirms, employing about 1,000 people. Its holdings included office,retail and hotel buildings and athletic clubs.   Neil Bush and Walters were partners in JNB Exploration, an oilexploration company. Walters testified at the hearing that he paid$150,000 in 1983 to own 6 percent of the company while Bush paid$100 to gain an 87.5 percent stake.   Bush joined Silverado's board of directors two years later.   Documents released last week by federal regulators indicate Bushvoted to approve the in loans to Walters.   Walters, one of Silverado's preferred shareholders and one ofits biggest borrowers, said he would try to pay back the money.   ``I have elected to spend the last year and a half workingdiligently with my lenders, restructuring, staying alive foranother day so that I can pay every dime back if I can,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
