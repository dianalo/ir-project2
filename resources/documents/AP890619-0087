Sen. Robert Kasten said the lecture seminar by politicians,journalists, economists and artists is the first step towardestablishing such a U.S. institution in Moscow.   ``We see this as the beginning of an American university inMoscow,'' the Wisconsin Republican said before addressing a group of100 Soviet intellectuals at the seminar, sponsored by the SovietAcademy of Sciences, the Washington-based Independent University andthe American Foreign Policy Council.   Other lecturers at the seminar included Sen. Phillip Gramm,R-Texas, Norman Podhoretz, editor of Commentary magazine, and FrankShakespeare, the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.   Kasten said the possibility of establishing a Moscow-baseduniversity where Soviets and foreigners could study is a result ofPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of political restructuringand openness.   All Soviet instititions of higher learning now are run by thegovernment.   Kasten said he hoped the proposed new university would be similarto the American universities in the capitals of Lebanon and Egypt.Those universities are four-year institutions offering collegedegrees.   Edward Lozansky, a Soviet emigre and director of the IndependentUniversity, said: ``If everything goes right, we could beginoffering regular courses by 1990.'' Lozansky and other officialswere not specific on what approval was needed to open a full-timeschool.   The summer-school program, which began on Sunday and ends Friday,includes lectures, discussions and panels in which Americans andSoviets compare their political and economic systems.   Gramm spoke about capitalism, freedom and opportunity in Americaand Kasten discussed the separation of powers laid down by the U.S.Constitution. ``My lecture is sort of like teaching Civics 101 tothe Soviets,'' he said.   Lozansky said that if everything goes according to plan, theSoviet government will provide quarters for the university andfunding will come from independent groups in the United States.   The university in Beirut has been closed since the latestoutbreak in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war began in March.</TEXT></DOC>
