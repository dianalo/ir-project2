Service Resources said the bid by its Charles P. Young andamp; Co. subsidiary for Pandick, a financial printing company, is subject to arranging financing.    Young also is a financial printer. Service Resources provides back-office services for law firms, investment banks and other companies.    Service Resources said it will ask Edward G. Green, Pandick's current chairman and chief executive officer, to head the combined financial printing operation that would be created in the acquisition.    Mr. Green isn't part of the management group that made the $251 million leveraged buyout offer for Pandick. That group is led by four Pandick officials, including Anthony K. Moulton, Pandick president. Mr. Moulton is Mr. Green's son-in-law.    Pandick officials couldn't be reached for comment.    In a leveraged buyout, investors acquire a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. The debt is intended to be paid off with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of assets.    Service Resources said it has received two &quot;written proposals&quot; from prospective lenders. It said one proposal was for as much as $150 million in financing from a large bank, and the other is for $25 million in equity financing from a second, undisclosed source. It said it expects another equity participant to join the bid shortly. A company official said Service Resources doesn't yet have commitments from any prospective lender.    Last March, Service Resources said it planned to sell Young. But Service Resources said yesterday that it believes that consolidating Pandick and Young will result in a more profitable venture.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Pandick rose 37.5 cents a share, to $25.625, on volume of more than 700,000 shares. </TEXT></DOC>
