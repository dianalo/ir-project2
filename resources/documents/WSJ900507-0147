Last week, the struggling unit of GLI Holding Co.initiated a series of meetings with lenders, creditors andsuppliers aimed at restructuring credit agreements andextending payments on both its publicly held debt and billsowed to suppliers. The company also laid off 170, or about5%, of its headquarters and administrative employees.</LP><TEXT>   The actions came as the company disclosed in a Securitiesand Exchange Commission filing that it posted a staggering$55.8 million loss on revenue of $172.5 million during thefirst quarter ended March 31. For the same period a year ago,Greyhound had a loss of $14.4 million on revenue of $223.5million.   Because of the losses, the company said it didn't makenearly $5 million in lease payments on buses and propertiesdue April 30. The company faces similar lease payments ofvarying amounts every month. Greyhound also said it wouldn'tmake a $9.8 million May 15 interest payment on its 13% seniornotes due in 1995. That prompted Moody's Investors ServiceInc. to downgrade its rating on those bonds to Caa fromsingle-B-3 on Friday.   Meanwhile, the company's deteriorating financial situationhas apparently dimmed the chances for an early end to thetwo-month-long walkout by 9,400 members of the AmalgamatedTransit Union.   Union negotiators came away from a federally mediatedweekend bargaining session in Washington, D.C., furious aboutnew company contract proposals which they claimed wouldresult in substantial pay cuts for drivers. &quot;They're worsethan the ones we had before,&quot; said Edward Strait, presidentof the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, theATU's bargaining unit. &quot;We're going backwards.&quot; Prior to thestrike, Greyhound proposed a three-year package ofincentive-based pay raises that included a 6.9% pay boost in1990.   Mr. Strait said the company is seeking a six-year contractwith no pay increases during the first four years and 3% payboosts in each of the last two years. He said a companyproposal to end mileage-based pay and put all drivers on a$12.79 an hour wage would effectively cut many drivers' payby roughly $125 a week.   Greyhound officials with knowledge of the talks couldn'tbe reached for comment.   In the SEC filing, Greyhound blamed its mounting financialwoes on the often violent strike. The company said it hadspent more than $20 million on security, legal fees and newdriver training since the strike began March 2. Don Seaquist,vice president and treasurer, said that was about three timeswhat the company expected to spend.   The company said that since the walkout began, 46Greyhound buses and terminals have been hit by gunfire, morethan 100 bomb threats have been made and company facilitiesand personnel have been the targets of hundreds of incidentsof assault, vandalism and arson.   Greyhound said it has spent $8.3 million beefing upsecurity and pursued injunctions in more than 20 state courtsat a cost of $4.4 million in legal fees. In addition, Mr.Seaquist said, violence has meant that far fewer uniondrivers cross the picket lines than anticipated, forcingGreyhound to find and train more replacement drivers whileinitially being unable to operate at expected levels.   While declining to estimate additional losses the companyexpects to report in April, May and possibly June, Mr.Seaquist said, &quot;the major costs associated with the strikeare behind us.&quot;   With the busy summer travel season fast approaching,Greyhound said it is operating 87% of its route system andachieving 68%-70% of pre-strike revenue.   In an effort to boost ridership and revenue, last week thecompany launched a nationwide advertising campaign, slashedfares on certain routes and began offering an unrestricted&quot;go anywhere&quot; $99 roundtrip fare.   But with Greyhound saddled with more than $340 million inlong-term debt from its 1987 leveraged buy-out, some industryanalysts questioned whether the company can avoid abankruptcy filing.   &quot;It's not inevitable but it's certainly a very clearpossibility,&quot; said Philip Baggaley, analyst and senior vicepresident with Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. In addition to drivingcustomers away, he said the company's financial announcementslast week could make it more difficult to obtain fuel, spareparts and other necessary items from suppliers.</TEXT></DOC>
