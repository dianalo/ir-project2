Wages will increase an average 1.7% over the life of the labor contracts, which generally run two or three years.    When these workers bargained over wages two to three years ago, settlements resulted in first-year wage reductions averaging 0.4% and yearly gains averaging 2% over the life of the contracts. Generally, gains in union wage settlements have been shrinking in recent years, reflecting continuing pressure on companies and unions to keep wage gains modest.    Of the approximately 230,000 workers covered by big labor contracts settled in the first quarter, 143,500 will receive wage increases over the life of the contracts, 33,700 will have wage decreases, and wages won't change for 52,600. These contracts included workers in the steel, transportation, construction, retail, food, real estate and service industries.    In manufacturing, the contract settlements will result in first-year wage reductions averaging 1.8% and yearly cuts averaging 0.3% over the life of the contracts. These figures partly reflect pay cuts in the steel industry. Some of these decreases were partly offset by one-time lump-sum payments.    Settlements in non-manufacturing industries accounted for nearly two-thirds of the workers under contracts negotiated in the first quarter. They provided first-year wage gains averaging 2.6% and yearly gains averaging 2.9% over the life of the contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
