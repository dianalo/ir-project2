It can provide beam powers of up to onekilowatt at an energy of 10 MeV and has an energy limiting system thatconforms with the requirements of the Codex Alimentarius for food irradiation.The basic machine can be used for simple batch irradiation work. It isequipped with an industrial digital process controller, however, whichcan be interfaced to conveyor and package identification systems to allowthe investigation of production line operation on a pilot scale. Thepaper describes the main features of the machine and its operation andreviews possible installations and uses.</TEXT></DOC>
