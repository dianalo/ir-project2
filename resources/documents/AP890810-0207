President Bush signed legislation Wednesday committing Americantaxpayers to an estimated $157 billion _ $600 for every man, womanand child _ over the next 30 years to solve the nation's biggestfinancial crisis since the Depression.   ``We can and will preserve a safe, efficient and equitablefinancial system for ourselves and ... for our kids,'' Bush saidbefore signing a bill providing money to cover more than $100billion in Sandamp;L losses over the past decade to speculative, andoften fraudulent, lending.   The Treasury Department planned today to borrow the first $5billion of a $20 billion downpayment to be made over the next sevenweeks to reduce an estimated $20 million in daily losses byinsolvent but still operating Sandamp;Ls.   L. William Seidman, head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.and in charge of the day-to-day cleanup, said three-fourths of thefirst $20 billion will be used to reduce interest rates beingoffered by some shaky thrifts to attract deposits. Those rates areexpected to fall from 11 percent to 8 percent or 9 percent.   That step alone, affecting an estimated $50 billion in high-ratecertificates of deposit held by savers, is expected to immediatelycut the daily losses by $2 million or $3 million, say Seidman andprivate analysts.   Most of the $50 billion in high-rate CDs have short durations _30, 60 or 90 days. As they expire, savers can either withdraw theirdeposits or roll them over at interest rates 2 to 3 percentagepoints lower.   To whatever extent there are withdrawals, the government willuse $15 billion of what it is borrowing this month and next atinterest rates of about 8 percent to replace the high-rate CDs andsustain the institutions with enough cash to keep operating.   Private analysts said they expect the infusion of lower-rategovernment cash into the ailing Sandamp;Ls to ripple throughout theindustry, putting downward pressure on rates for all deposits aswell as the rates borrowers pay for new home mortgages and otherloans.   Those trying to buy homes also should benefit because the billpushes Sandamp;Ls back into home mortgage lending and out of riskyinvestments such as speculative commercial real estate projects andjunk bonds.   Thrifts will be required to raise the level of housing andhousing-related loans in their portfolios to 70 percent from 60percent.   Unresolved is whether the Resolution Trust Corp., the agencycreated to close or merge 400 to 700 insolvent or marginallysolvent Sandamp;Ls over the next 26 months, will unilaterally reduceinterest rates on high-rate, long-term CDs with durations up to 30months.   The trust corporation's predecessor, the Federal Home Loan BankBoard, had honored those interest rates in taking over failed Sandamp;Ls.FDIC Director C.C. Hope Jr. said he expected a decision ``in thenext few days.''   Whatever that decision, analysts said they expected the influxof government cash into the troubled institutions _ about one-sixthof the industry _ to ripple throughout the entire financial system.   ``It will be a generational impact _ because people over 50 havemore cash and savings and people under 50 generally have moredebt,'' said Alex Sheshunoff, a private analyst.   ``As interest rates come down, it's going to benefit borrowersmore than depositors,'' he said. ``The last chance to catch thehigh-rate CD freight train was before 10:45 a.m. (Wednesday) whenBush signed the bill.''   Immediately upon Bush's signature, the Resolution Trust Corp.authorized spending $215 million to liquidate or subsidize themerger of three of 262 ailing thrifts the government has taken oversince February.   Another $600 million was authorized for liquidations and mergersover the next two weeks.   Officials anticipate it will take 26 months and the expenditureof all $50 billion provided in the legislation to stem theindustry's losses, assuming interest rates don't rise.   Including interest on the money being borrowed to address thecrisis, the bailout will cost $159 billion over the next 10 yearsand $285 billion _ $157 billion of it from taxpayers _ over 30years, according to administration and congressional estimates.   Sandamp;L owners will be required to put up billions of dollars moreof their own money as a buffer between risky loans and thegovernment's deposit insurance funds ``so these problems will neverhappen again,'' Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
