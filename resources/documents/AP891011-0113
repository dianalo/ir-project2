Camp and field training, marching in formation, and basicmilitary knowledge also are on the curriculum, the Guangming Dailysaid Wednesday. It did not give details of the weapons training orsay whether the students would use live ammunition.   Xinhua News Agency reported 143 other colleges and universitieswould conduct special eight-week military and political trainingcourses, variously sending all or some of the students to militarycamps or inviting officers to campus.   Beijing University, whose students helped lead the crushedpro-democracy movement in the spring, announced that its freshmenclass would spend a full year in military training at the armyacademy in Shijiazhuang, 190 miles south of Beijing.   University President Wu Shuqing said Saturday it was anexperiment that had been planned well before the pro-democracyprotests. He said experience had shown that military training wasbeneficial to students.   Most colleges already require one month of military training forfreshmen, but it is usually restricted to parade-ground drills andbasic military theory.   Xinhua quoted an unidentified official of the State EducationCommission as saying the commission drew up a plan in 1987 to sendstudents at 10 key univerities, including Beijing University, for a``relatively long period of military training.''   ``The plan failed because it was beyond the capacity of thearmy,'' he said. But it was going ahead for Beijing University, hesaid, because ``the graduates of the prestigious Beijing Universityshould be fit for socialist construction (and) have a clearpolitical orientation and sound morality.''   He said the program was not punishment for the students' role inthe protests. He said military training was popular among students,parents and teachers ``because after the training the studentsbecome better disciplined, and come to have a better understandingof the practical conditions of the country.''   Many more colleges wish to send students for such training, hesaid.   The Guangming Daily said the Beijing University class woulddivide its time evenly among military, political and humanitiesclasses. It said the school planned an opening ceremony for thestudents Thursday, and had been preparing for their arrival byshipping in textbooks and freshly painting the dormitories,cafeterias and desks.   The students will wear the same uniform as the academy's 3,400military cadets, Xinhua said. It described the school as China'sbest training ground for junior officers, with ``up-to-dateteaching facilities.''   Beijing University's freshman class numbers fewer than 800 thisyear, down from the 2,100 that had been planned before the protestsand the June army crackdown. The State Education Commission, whichdecides enrollment, also has cut the freshman classes of otheruniversities nationwide, apparently in an effort to better maintaincontrol over the student body.   Wu said Beijing University's student population had grown toolarge for its facilities, but said next year's freshman classprobably would be closer to the size of previous years.</TEXT></DOC>
