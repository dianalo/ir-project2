The conceptual frame of such safety analyses together with theresulting economic benefits are illustrated by four concrete applicationsdemonstrating reduction of excessive safety margins, increase in dischargeburnup, streamlining of steam break analysis, and increase in operationalflexibility of first cores.</TEXT></DOC>
