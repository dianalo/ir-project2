<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-49-0416 </DOCNO><TEXT>The advent of computed tomography (CT) revolutionized the diagnostic evaluationof the patient in whom intracranial infection was suspected. CT providedinformation about the presence or absence of a mass, its location, itseffect on the ventricular system and subarachnoid pathways, and withthe use of intravenous radiographic contrast agents, the state of theblood-brain barrier (BBB). The CT information supplanted that obtainedfrom more invasive imaging studies (ventriculography, pneumoencephalography,and arteriography). In little more than a decade following the introductionof CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a clinical tool. Thequestion is now, Will MRI alter the role of CT in the evaluation of intracranialinfections and if so, for what reasons? The experience with MRI in theevaluation of intracranial infections has thus far been restricted becauseof an insufficient number of scanners and their limited availabilityfor inpatients. Moreover, this new technique is still under development,and any data accumulated are preliminary. Thus, the literature on theapplication of MRI to intracranial infections has so far been sparse.The aim of this chapter is to put into perspective our initial experiencewith MRI in intracranial infections.</TEXT></DOC>
