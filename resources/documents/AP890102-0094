Steep price increases announced Dec. 26 led to demonstrations anda general strike. Four people died and scores were injured beforeunion leaders called off the protests Saturday, two days after thegovernment rescinded the price increases.   On Monday, more than 500 leaders of trade and professionalorganizations met with Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi to discuss theimpact of the violence and the government's failure to endorse aninitiative to end civil war in southern Sudan.   In addition to the rollback on prices, the government gave in toa demand by the Sudanese Workers' Trade Union Federation to makesalary increases of up to 500 percent retroactive to July 1, insteadof Dec. 1 as the government had ordered.   While Mahdi conceded the price increases may have been too high _as much as 600 percent for sugar _ he said prices on some items hadto be raised. He promised to stay away from important foods,however, and said subsidies on sorghum, the Sudanese staple, andmedicines wouldn't be touched.   ``There are other possibilities and other more reasonable (price)increases that I don't want to go into now,'' Mahdi said.   He said the price of sugar, extremely important in the Sudaneseculture, must be increased to cover its production costs and toprevent smuggling into neighboring countries.   ``Any steps must not affect the workers and struggling people andadd to their burdens,'' said Abdel-Wahab Sinada, representative ofthe professional associations. ``We reject any increase in prices.We are ready for civil disobedience and general strikes.''   Professional groups carry considerable weight in Sudan and playeda decisive role in the 1985 military coup that ousted theauthoritarian pro-Western president, Gaafar Nimeiri. Tradesmen andstudents were the major forces behind last week's disturbances.   Western observers fear the trade and professional unions mightjoin forces with the Democratic Unionist Party, still angered overMahdi's handling of the peace agreement it reached a month and ahalf ago with the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.   During the strike, the Unionists resigned from the coalitionCabinet headed by the Umma Party in sympathy with the demonstratorsand outrage over the prime minister's stand on the peace agreement.   Mahdi apparently refused to officially endorse the agreementbecause of a clause advocating suspension of the 1,400-year-oldIslamic legal code, which was sure to anger the fundamentalistNational Islamic Front _ the third-largest Cabinet partner andMahdi's buffer against his traditional opponents, the DemocraticUnionists.   Publicly, Mahdi says he objects to the pact's clauses eliminatingdefense treaties with other countries and ending emergency rule,which has been Nimeiri's overthrow in 1985.   The unions have been demanding immediate implementation of thepeace plan and a cease-fire in the 5{-year-old civil war on groundit would save the country $275 million a year. Sudan's foreign debtis $14 billion, and Khartoum owes more than $900 million in interestit can't pay.   ``It is slowly but surely building up into another explosivesituation,'' a Western political observer said on condition ofanonymity.   ``The (Democratic Unionist Party) is gathering forces with thesouthern and communist parties and the trade and professionalunions, calling for implementing the peace initiative. This willsooner or later spill into the streets in demonstrations, and thiscould be ugly.''   John Garang, leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, calledfor Mahdi's resignation in a New Year's Day radio broadcast fromAddis Ababa, Ethiopia. He suggested direct peace talks with Sudanesearmy generals, ``especially those fighting in the south.''   Defending his views on the agreement, Mahdi told union leaders,``We do not disagree on the peace issue, but there are specificpoints in the initiative that have to be resolved.''   He agreed to form a committee with the union leaders to discusspossible solutions to the civil war and the economic situation.</TEXT></DOC>
