Sgt. Christopher Austinwrites in his first letter home from Saudi Arabia. ``We used tobalance ourselves on the teeter-totter.''   His mother, Pam Huffman, has read and reread the words,scrunched close on sheets from a memo pad. Her sisters, friends andteen-age daughters all heard excerpts before she tucked the letteraway in a plastic sandwich bag.   ``It's the most precious thing I've ever received,'' said Mrs.Huffman, whose only son is in the Army's 82nd Airborne.   Like thousands of others, Austin is prepared to battle Iraq'sSaddam Hussein. And yet, all he really wants is to come home.   He's 22, tall, slim and blond. His blue eyes dance when hesmiles, which he does a lot. He loves New Castle, Ind., freshlaundry, football and Kim, his high school sweetheart and bride ofthree months.   ``I remember when I was in the first grade, Mom, and I used towalk to school. I saw this bird every morning and it seemed tofollow me all the way, every morning,'' writes Austin.   ``I remember Uncle Terry and how he used to play his guitar andsing to me. I remember I used to ride my Big Wheel around the blockand try to jump the humps and cracks in the sidewalk.''   Memories of home have helped sustain the more than 100,000 U.S.servicemen and women in Saudia Arabia since Iraq invaded Kuwait onAug. 2. They make the 120-degree desert days and Septembersandstorms easier to bear.   ``Hello sweetheart,'' writes Army Pfc. Sean Walters to his wifein Crossville, Tenn. ``It's not all that bad yet. (But) it's hotand boring ... and the only thing you see are tents for as long asyou can see.''   Mai Walters, who left Vietnam after Saigon fell in 1975, islonely but stoic in her young husband's absence. She waits andwrites to him, then waits some more before finally receiving hisfirst letters.   ``Two in one day!'' she yelped after swinging shut her curbsidemailbox.   ``It's 5 o'clock in the evening here. That would make it 9o'clock in the morning there. I miss you very much...,'' writesWalters, a 25-year-old Minnesota native. ``I hate being away fromyou, but it's out of my control.''   Soldiers stationed in the Middle East don't have much, if any,access to telephones. So they, and relatives back home, revert tothat wonderful old dinosaur: the letter.   Even if written in chicken scratch on dog-eared paper, throughthe mail come bits and pieces of life sometimes lost in telephonecalls. There is time for reflection; time to scribble things in themargin.   ``Mike, Tony and I have been spending as much time together aswe can,'' Sgt. Gary Bruce Goodwin assured his mom. He and his twobrothers are also deployed with the Fort Bragg, N.C.-based 82ndAirborne.   ``Currently, Mike is suffering from a severe case of diarrhea.Everybody here is getting it. I had mine last week for five daysand, believe me, it was awful,'' writes Goodwin, 27, the middleson.   ``Hello from Saudi Arabia,'' writes Jim Bell, a sober23-year-old who works in Marine intelligence. ``(It) is reallydesolate. Nothing but miles and miles of sand dunes.''   His father, architect Robert Bell, pauses after reading theletter again.   ``I've been thinking over the last few weeks about what myposition is on this,'' said the Oak Park, Ill., father of six. ``Myposition is we should get out. I remember the Vietnam thing.''   His son, who was 8 years old when Saigon fell, is grave abouthis commitment to the military. But clearly, too, he is anxiousabout the risks of war.   ``It is difficult to say when I'll get back to the states,''writes Jim, who'd planned to take accounting courses this fall atthe University of Southern California. ``I wish it were tomorrow... (but) it looks pretty bleak.''   Even Army Pfc. Wade Merritt, the Tennessee soldier whose letterPresident Bush held up before the nation as an emblem ofpatriotism, has his fears.   ``As much as I love my job, I don't believe in war or theunnecessary acts of violence against fellow human beings, but it ismy job,'' he wrote in a passage the president did not include inhis televised address.   ``When I made a decision to make the Army my career, I knew thatthis day would come,'' he wrote. ``But I was hoping it wouldn't.''   ``Yes, I'm a little scared,'' writes Mrs. Huffman's son,Christopher. ``Check up on Kim for me. I hated leaving her in thenight like that. It was 2 a.m. and she was real shaky, you know?   ``Just help he out and tell her that I love her, because Ireally miss her, Mom.''</TEXT></DOC>
