The incident is one among many in an agency that is understaffedand poorly managed, witnesses told the special subcommittee lookingat the way federal agencies and private businesses deal withIndians.   Larry Morey, deputy inspector general of the Department ofHealth and Human Services, told the panel Monday his office isinvestigating the IHS handling of $70,000 that was earmarked foralcohol abuse programs.   Instead, Morey testified, the money was spent to send topofficials of the IHS office in Albuquerque, N.M., to a ``retreat.''   Ken Ballen, chief counsel for the committee, said panelinvestigators discovered the group went to a resort near Santa Fe,N.M., and engaged in activities such as massage therapy.   Dr. Everett Rhoades, IHS director, later defended the use of themoney, telling reporters the event was a staff training program.   In order for the staff to help Indians change their behaviortoward alcohol, they had to change how they regard themselves, hesaid   ``We have to be a proponent of wellness,'' he said. It is``crucial to train them (the staff) how to be leaders to modifycommunity behavior.''   Dr. Bruce Nicholson, former clinical director for IHS in PineRidge, S.D., accused the IHS of misusing funds.   ``In my experience, they were spending money on conferences andair travel when we were desperately asking for more nurse midwivesand ob-gyn services to combat infant mortality rates of 30 to 40percent per 1,000 live births,'' he said.   He called IHS ``bureaucracy that has gotten out of control.''   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., chairman of the Senate SelectCommittee on Indian Affairs, said IHS officials won't be questioneduntil the special investigating subcommittee has had time to studydocuments that were finally provided by the IHS.   The agency sent the documents to the panel Friday, DeConcinisaid, even though the papers had been requested March 2.   ``It was not until Friday evening, May 12, at 6:20 p.m., lessthan 72 hours before this hearing, that the agency provided us withany of the documents we requested,'' DeConcini said.   He said that did not give the committee time to preparequestions.   ``We will not allow IHS to alter or compromise the quality andintegrity of our investigative practices,'' DeConcini said.   Rhoades agreed that the IHS should have been more forthcoming,but said the amount of work involved in meeting the committee'srequests was ``astronomical.''   He said the committee's March 2 letter requesting documentation``never came to my attention.''   When he found out about the request, he said, he ordered thatthe subcommitee be provided all the information it wanted.   ``The material was out in the field,'' Rhoades said. ``It tooktime to gather.''   Rhoades said his agency has always been cooperative and hedirected his subordinates to be open with the committee as soon ashe heard an investigation was underway.   DeConcini said none of the other eight government agencies beinginvestigated by his special committee has been as difficult as theIHS.   ``Unlike every other federal agency we have examined, the IndianHealth Service has been singularly uncooperative with ourcommittee's investigation,'' he said.   Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., called it ``stonewalling.''</TEXT></DOC>
