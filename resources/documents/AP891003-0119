They said more than 3,800 supply flights landed in Kabul fromFeb. 15, when the Red Army withdrew after nine years of involvementin the Afghan civil war, and the beginning of September.   The diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, estimatedSoviet military aid to Afghanistan during the first half of 1989was worth more than $1.5 billion.   Equipment delivered includes medium-range missiles, tanks andother armored vehicles, artillery, and MiG-21 and Sukhoi-25 jetfighters, the sources reported.   Moslem rebels, supported by neighboring Pakistan and the UnitedStates, regularly raid or have cut most roads linking cities,making overland supply difficult and dangerous.   Government forces hold the major cities, but guerrillas controlmuch of the mountainous countryside after more than 11 years ofcivil war.   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan said Tuesday hergovernment was working with Moscow on a political solution to theAfghan conflict.   ``We are discussing with the Soviet Union a consensus resolutionon Afghanistan which will be presented at the current session ofthe United Nations General Assembly,'' she told reporters in Dhakaat the end of a three-day visit to Bangladesh. She did notelaborate.   Ms. Bhutto said a broad-based representative government was theonly way ``to peace and stability in Afghanistan.''   She also said a ``conducive condition'' should be created inAfghanistan for the return of more than 3.5 million Afghans whohave fled to cities and camps inside Pakistan.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after acommunist coup in April 1978. The major insurgent groups are basedin Paksitan.   Diplomats and guerrilla spokesman say battles occur regularlyalong the Salang Highway, which connects Kabul with the Sovietborder 210 miles to the north. They said the army had sentreinforcements to help fight guerrillas who fire at convoys fromthe mountains.   Many trucks that make it to Kabul use a detour built just northof the city, where guerrillas have controlled a 21-mile stretch ofthe Salang since June, the diplomats reported.   Heavy attacks by insurgents also were reported on convoys boundfor Kandahar in the southeast, Afghanistan's second-largest city.Diplomats said guerrillas firing rockets and anti-tank weaponsstopped half of a 1,000-unit convoy approaching the city anddestroyed more than 100 vehicles.</TEXT></DOC>
