The U.S.S.R. willdetermine the total allowable catch in the Soviet EZ for each stock, theharvesting capacity of its own fishing vessels with regard to the stock,and the portion of the total allowable catch for the stock that is surplus.The U.S.S.R. may then allocate a portion of that surplus to U.S. nationalsand vessels.The United States does not recognize Soviet claims east of the U.S.-RussiaConvention line of 1867. Industry agreements with Soviet fishermen notwithstanding,U.S. vessels fishing east of the convention line are subject to the applicableprovisions of U.S. fisheries laws and regulations, including the governingregulations implementing fishery management plans. Fishing under the MagnusonAct includes the catching, taking or harvesting of fish and any activitiesin preparation for or in support of the catching, taking or harvestingof fish. Questions concerning the activities which may be authorized eastof the convention line should be referred to the NOAA Fisheries contactindividuals referenced above.The United States has agreed that it will take appropriate measures, consistentwith its national law, to ensure that its nationals and vessels conductfishery operations within the Soviet EZ consistent with the national lawsand regulations of the U.S.S.R.; refrain from fishing beyond the U.S. ExclusiveEconomic Zone for fishery resources over which the U.S.S.R., consistentwith international law, has sovereign rights or management authority, exceptas authorized by the Agreement; and comply with the provisions of permitsissued pursuant to the Agreement and the applicable laws of the U.S.S.R.The United States has agreed that its nationals and vessels will be subjectto the relevant laws and regulations of the U.S.S.R. when the U.S. nationalsand vessels are engaged in fishing in the Soviet EZ. The United Stateshas also agreed that its nationals and vessels will be subject to the relevantlaws and regulations of the U.S.S.R. pertaining to fishery resource managementwhen engaged in fishing outside the Soviet EZ for fishery resources ofthe continental shelf of the U.S.S.R., or beyond any exclusive economiczone or its equivalent for anadromous species that originate in the watersof the U.S.S.R.The United States has agreed, consistent with its national law, that itwill take appropriate measures to ensure that its nationals and vesselsrefrain from harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing any marine mammalwithin the Soviet EZ, or attempting such actions, except as may be providedfor by an international agreement to which both the United States and theU.S.S.R. are parties, or in accordance with specific authorization andcontrols established; by the U.S.S.R.The United States has consented to, and, to the extent allowable underU.S. law, will assist and facilitate boardings and inspections of its vesselsby duly authorized officers of the U.S.S.R. for compliance with the relevantlaws and regulations of the U.S.S.R. If, upon boarding and inspection ofa vessel by a duly authorized officer, such law or regulation is foundto have been violated, the United States will not object to appropriateenforcement action undertaken pursuant to the laws of the U.S.S.R., includingseizure and arrest of the vessel and the individuals on board. The U.S.S.R.will impose appropriate penalties, in accordance with the laws of the U.S.S.R.,for violations of the relevant laws or regulations of the U.S.S.R. In thecase of arrest and seizure of a vessel of the United States, the UnitedStates will be notified through diplomatic channels of the facts and actionstaken. The U.S.S.R. will release vessels of the United States and theircrews promptly, subject to the posting of reasonable bond or other security.The penalty for violation of a limitation or restriction on the fishingoperations of the nationals or vessels of the United States will be limitedto appropriate fines, penalties, forfeitures, or revocation or suspensionof fishing privileges.The United States has agreed to take appropriate steps to ensure that observersof the U.S.S.R. are permitted to board, upon request, vessels operatingin the Soviet EZ pursuant to the Agreement, and that the U.S.S.R. willbe reimbursed for the costs incurred in the utilization of its observers,consistent with the laws and regulations of the U.S.S.R. and on the basisof reciprocity. Such observers must be accorded the courtesies and accommodationsprovided to ship's officers while on board such vessels, and the operatorsand crews of such vessels must cooperate with observers in the conductof their official duties.The Agreement specifies the procedures for application for, and issuanceof, annual permits authorizing vessels of the United States to engage infishing for fishery resources over which the U.S.S.R. exercises sovereignrights or fishery management authority.Pursuant to this Agreement, and consistent with national law, NOAA issuesthis interim final rule imposing a number of requirements and prohibitionson U.S. nationals and vessels desiring to engage in fishing operationsfor fishery resources over which the U.S.S.R. exercises sovereign rightsor fishery management authority, including fishing in the Soviet EZ, fishingfor fishery resources of the continental shelf of the U.S.S.R., and fishingbeyond any exclusive economic zone or its equivalent for anadromous speciesthat originate in the waters of the U.S.S.R.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>This rule is authorized under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and ManagementAct (Magnuson Act), 16 U.S.C. 1822(a)(4)(A), which authorizes the Secretaryof State in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce to enter into reciprocalfishing agreements, and 16 U.S.C. 1855(g), which authorizes the Secretaryof Commerce to promulgate regulations necessary to carry out the provisionsof the Magnuson Act.The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (Assistant Administrator),has determined that this rule will not have a significant impact on thehuman environment. NMFS has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) onthe rule. The finding of the EA was that no significant impact on the humanenvironment will occur as a result of this rule and that no environmentalimpact statement was required. The EA is available upon request. (See <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>.) This action is exempt from the provisions of ExecutiveOrder 12291 under section 1(a)(2) because these regulations are issuedwith respect to a foreign affairs function of the United States.This action is not subject to section 553 of the Adminsitrative ProcedureAct (APA) because the implementation of this rule is a foreign affairsfunction under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). The Assistant Administrator is solicitingpublic comments on this rule, and will consider them to the extent discretionexists to modify the regulations consistent with national law and the Agreement.Because neither the APA nor any other statute requires public notice andopportunity to comment upon this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act doesnot apply to it and no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement at andSection;299.3(a) subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et. seq.</T3>). A request to collect this information has been submittedto the Office of Management and Budget for approval. Public reporting burdenfor this collection is estimated to average 0.5 hour per response, includingthe time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any otheraspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducingthis burden, to the Operations Support and Analysis Division, NMFS, andto OMB (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>).This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. Neither does this rule directly affect the coastal zone of any statewith an approved coastal zone management program.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 299</ITAG>Fisheries, Foreign fishing, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, U.S.-U.S.S.R.Agreement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
