Those relations have come under scrutiny in recent weeksas IBM and Microsoft -- whose partnership helped provide thefoundation for the personal-computer industry -- haveincreasingly headed in different directions.</LP><TEXT>   The industry executives said IBM and Novell will announcethat the IBM sales force will resell Novell's Netwareoperating system, which controls the flow of traffic onpersonal-computer networks. IBM, Armonk, N.Y., declined tocomment. Novell, Provo, Utah, said officials were travelingover the weekend and couldn't be reached.   IBM already sells a competing operating system, called LANServer, which derives from Microsoft's LAN Manager, so anyshift by IBM customers toward Novell would mark a setback forMicrosoft.   Microsoft, which dominates the market for personalcomputer operating systems, has said it views the networkoperating system market as the next great battleground.Microsoft has talked about beefing up its development effortsand distribution network to match Novell's -- Microsoft hassaid there are more Novell Netware dealers in the U.S. thanthere are 7-Elevens, making it easier to buy that operatingsystem than it is to buy a Slurpie.   But Microsoft's LAN Manager -- together with such cousinsas IBM's LAN Server -- controlled just 10% of the world-widemarket for network operating systems last year, according toInternational Data Corp., Framingham, Mass., amarket-research firm. Novell controlled 53%, IDC said. And toovertake Novell, Microsoft needs to retain what support ithas among the hardware giants, with their huge sales forces.   On speculation that Novell would soon announce marketingagreements with IBM and Digital Equipment Corp., Novell stockhas jumped from $43 at the end of last month; it rose $1.625Friday to $47.625, a 52-week high, in over-the-countertrading. Microsoft stock, itself on a furious climb of late,climbed $1 to $104 in over-the-counter trading. IBM increased$1 to $129.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.   The remaining question is just how hard IBM salesmen willpush Netware. IBM will continue to sell the rival LAN Server,and it remains the industry's biggest supporter of the OS/2operating system, which provides the basis for LAN Server.Still, IBM has become more pragmatic about its productofferings, and customers seem to want Netware more than theydo Microsoft's offering.   In addition, the industry executives noted that IBM has inrecent months announced a series of agreements with MetaphorComputer Systems, Go Corp. and Adobe Systems Inc. forsoftware that IBM in the past might have developed withMicrosoft. Microsoft, for its part, has begun emphasizing theWindows system-software product that it developed on its own,even though IBM has pushed it to promote OS/2, which IBM andMicrosoft developed together.</TEXT></DOC>
