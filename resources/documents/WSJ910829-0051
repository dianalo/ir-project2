States and cities push ATMsafety laws.   In the absence of federal security rules for automatedteller machines, local bills proliferate. But apart from a1985 San Jose, Calif., regulation, none became law until aCalifornia bill passed in 1990, says Barry Schreiber,criminal justice professor at Minnesota's St. Cloud StateUniversity. Like a Nevada bill passed this June, California'slaw sets minimum lighting standards and requires givingcustomers safety data. &quot;There's been a steadily buildingpressure,&quot; he says.</LP><TEXT>   A second California bill would require law enforcementagencies to keep separate ATM crime data. Others include aNew Jersey bill and one in New York City. Nevertheless, anAmerican Bankers Association spokesman says such moves may bean overreaction, figuring that crime occurs fewer than onceevery million transactions.   Last year, ATM transactions hit 5.7 billion, up from400,000 in 1975, says the Electronic Funds TransferAssociation.                                                                                                          BEER VENDING MACHINES tap into a few states, but somewatchdogs foam.   Two Florida companies hawk the dispensers. An attendantreceives payment and then, by remote control, signals themachine to dispense the beer. Since one attendant -- such asa receptionist in a hotel lobby -- can oversee the machine,this allows places with alcohol permits to sell beer in moresites without adding workers, say Pascall Group Inc. ofMelbourne and Brewery Investment Group Inc. of Boca Raton.   Still, regulators are wary. Although the machines are usedin Florida, Michigan just drafted a rule barring liquordispensers. While Alaska has no such rule, &quot;there doesn'tseem to be any practical application that wouldn't run afoul&quot;of state law, says Patrick Sharrock of the liquor controlboard. And some in the industry are skeptical. &quot;It's just ahigh-priced cooler,&quot; says Victor Lavay of Vending TimesMagazine, balking at the $5,000 to $7,000 price tags.                                                                                                          FORGET DOUBLE BEDS: Business travelers want double phonelines.   Increasingly, hotels find that messages mean a lot. In SanFrancisco, the Fairmont spends $600,000 to add dual-linespeaker phones, modem links and voice mail to all rooms.Dallas's Westin Hotel Galleria puts two-line phones in 26executive rooms, but says cost is too high to outfit theother 404 rooms. New York's Peninsula and others make thephone console a room's nerve center -- a touch-sensitivescreen also adjusts light, temperature and television.   Voice mail wins praise for ease and accuracy, notably forforeign guests and longwinded callers, says consultant LarryChervenak. Hotels can be &quot;notoriously bad in takingmessages,&quot; he adds. With cellular phones, pagers, portablefax machines and computers in rooms, some hotel businesscenters lose luster. The Adolphus in Dallas counters with aprivate office &quot;so people don't feel like they're working ina Safeway,&quot; says hotel official Anne Patrick.   Quality Suites in Silicon Valley says its &quot;workaholic&quot;guests like room service breakfasts and modem hookups.                                                                                                          THESPIAN THERAPY: The National Board of Medical Examinersis devising a test of would-be doctors' bedside manner, usingtrained actors portraying real cases. It would test the&quot;ability to interact with patients and get information,&quot; saysDr. Mark H. Swartz of the Mount Sinai medical school in NewYork, which uses the technique.                                                                                                          SILENCE, PLEASE] Lightwave Technologies Inc., Chicago,pushes GameSounds, a wireless headphone set that letsNintendo game players hear the zaps and the bangs while theTV set's sound is off. The company called in a familypsychotherapist to help test market the product.                                                                                                          PUTTER'S PERK: Corporate Sports Incentives Inc.,Merrimack, N.H., peddles $32 &quot;golf tickets&quot; that companiescan buy as giveaways, much like baseball season seats. Thetickets entitle recipients to play on about 100 courses,mostly in New England.                                                                                                          CONSUMER ADVOCATES call for a transition class of drugs.   The National Consumers League says a category of curesthat don't need a doctor's Rx but must be dispensed bydruggists would widen access to some potent or complex drugswhile keeping them from being sold over the counter. TheWashington group dusts off an issue long backed only bydruggists: It's &quot;the first time anybody other thanpharmacists has been excited about it,&quot; says Robert Marshallof the California Pharmacists Association.   The consumer group is concerned about consumer misuse ofOTC medicines and the numerous prescription drugs underreview by the Food and Drug Administration for possibleswitch to OTC class, says Mary Ponder, deputy director. ButJack Walden of the Nonprescription Drug ManufacturersAssociation says a middle tier is &quot;unnecessary&quot; and wouldcreate a monopoly for druggists. Of 48 ingredients put in theOTC class since the 1970s, he says, only one was returned toprescription status.   Mr. Walden says association members may seek to switch 48ingredients or doses to OTC status by 1994.                                                                                                          BRIEFS: TAB Books of Blue Ridge Summit, Pa., gives a nodto history, pricing its paperback edition of Robert Fuson's&quot;The Log of Christopher Columbus&quot; at $14.92. . . . &quot;RayHartmann: He's Better Than Nothing,&quot; bragged the slogan of acandidate for the top slot at the Association of AlternativeNewsweeklies.
