(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge has dismissed a couple'slawsuit accusing Jim and Tammy Bakker of fraud and racketeering.   The suit, filed in July 1987, accused the Bakkers and former PTLExecutive Director Richard Dortch of overselling $1,000partnerships guaranteeing three free nights' lodging at PTL'sHeritage Grand Hotel each year for life.   U.S. District Judge Robert D. Potter on Monday said that Davidand Sarah Combs of West Virginia had no grounds to sue under thefederal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and thatthe suit was filed in the wrong state.   Ryan Hovis, an attorney for Bakker, said the ruling averts apossible class-action lawsuit in which about 55,000 lifetimepartners could have been eligible to collect damages.   Two other suits are pending against the Bakkers, Hovis said. Oneis another RICO lawsuit filed by a PTL partner and the other wasfiled by PTL.   Bakker left PTL in March 1987 amid a sex-and-money scandal, andthe organization he built is mired in bankruptcy court with debtsestimated at $130 million.   Bakker said he and his wife were ``absolutely elated'' by thedismissal.   ``It's just confirmation of what Tammy and I have said allalong: Once responsible people start reviewing these claims bythese people who are trying to hurt us, they'll know that we'vedone nothing wrong,'' Bakker said.   The Combses had charged that PTL sold more lifetime partnershipsthan the hotel could accommodate and that they couldn't get areservation.</TEXT></DOC>
