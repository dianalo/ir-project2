The maximum radial component of the magnetic fieldis 2 T. The magnetic-flux discontinuities are recorded by inductive sensorsand the magnetic field is recorded by a Hall sensor. The effect of acoating of normal metal and on the magnetic-flux discontinuities in aspecimen of superconducting ribbon based on Nb{sub 3}Sn is examined.</TEXT></DOC>
