The last-minute proposal, which passed 76-11 with 4 abstentions,allowed southern African nations to apply for exemptions to aspecial panel of experts.   The vote came at a meeting of the Convention on Trade inEndangered Species, or CITES, and drew a loud cheer fromenvironmentalists and delegates pushing for a ban.   The conference also is discussing 300 endangered plants andanimals in its biennial session, although the focus was onelephants.   The measure agreed to on Monday must be confirmed in a fullsession before the 10-day gathering ends Friday but delegatescalled that a formality.   It amounts to at least a two-year ban because no exemptions arelikely to be considered before the next CITES meeting.   ``We think this was a good compromise, a place to work from,''said Conny Harriman, head of the U.S. delegation that championedEast Africa's bid for a total ban.   ``I think it's great,'' said John Grandy of the Humane Societyof the United States.   Costa Mlay, Tanzania's director of wildlife, said East Africanswere satisfied. ``This is the best we could do, now we must try towork together.''   Shirley MacGreal, of the International Primate ProtectionLeague, based in Summerville, N.C., raised her fist in victory whenasked for her reaction. ``This is wonderful,'' she said.   But Rowan Martin, director of research for Zimbabwe's WildlifeDepartment, was bitter.   ``This is a great Pyrrhic,'' he said. ``They forced sevencountries who seemed to be doing well at conservation out of theconvention. ''   Under CITES rules, members can declare reservations within 90days, allowing them to trade with any other CITES states declaringexemptions or with non-CITES members.   Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, Botswana and Burundi _ whose landscontain about one-tenth of the African elephant herd _ said theywould file for exemptions.   Japan, which has regularly consumed about 40 percent of worldivory exports, declined comment. ``Our attitude will be determinedin Tokyo,'' acting delegation head Kiyohiko Arafuni told reporters.   Ivory is highly valued for its use in the signature stampspopular in many Asian nations and for jewelry, piano keys andcarvings.   Martin said southern Africans would have no trouble findingmarkets even without Japan.   ``That's the crazy part,'' he said. ``There are 67 non-partiesto the convention. Think of all those Arab states that would behappy to take over all that trade.''   He blamed the vote on American activists, describing them as``fat little puppies from urban environments who don't know a thingabout African reality.''   Environmentalists' reactions ranged from guarded optimism toeuphoria. They had lobbied hard to block any compromise which wouldlet southern Africa keep its elephants on the threatened list _Appendix II, which allows limited trade in elephant products _while the rest were moved to Appendix I, the endangered list, whichforbids all such trade.   ``This sends a single message to the world,'' said Cynthia Mossof the African Wildlife Foundation, author of ``Elephant Memories.''   ``A split listing would have made people think there is goodivory and bad ivory,'' she said.'' Now there is no question.''   Jeff Canin of Greenpeace International hailed the vote butcalled it only a first step toward protecting the elephant. He saidthe main thing was to persuade people to stop buying invory.   A recent census estimated Africa now has just over 600,000elephants. A decade ago it was l.3 million.   Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa argued that their ownanti-poaching measures and management had increased herds, forcingthem to cull elephants for ecological balance.   The sale of ivory from culled elephants contributes millions ofdollars to their wildlife management budgets, they said.   The compromise, proposed by Somalia, followed a failed attemptfor an outright ban. The United States, Kenya, Tanzania, Gambia,Austria and Hungary proposed that all African elephants be shiftedto Appendix I without exceptions. That vote was 53-36, lacking therequired two-thirds majority.   Desmond Bradley Martin, a Kenya-based American expert, estimatedit would now take at least $100 million a year to save majorpopulations in Africa.   ``African countries have to expand anti-poaching patrols andintelligence gathering,'' he said. ``If international funds are notmade available, many elephant populations will declinedrastically.''   After the session, CITES Secretary-General Eugene Lapointe ofCanada shrugged off criticism of his activities.   He said the U.S. delegation's request for an accounting of$85,000 from the sale by CITES of South American caiman skins wasthe sort of request for information a member state was entitled toask.   ``This is not the first time a government has asked thesecretariat what happened in a specific case,'' Lapointe said.   He attributed harsh criticism from environmentalist groups,including a request for police investigation, to a misunderstandingof CITES functions.   ``I am still sleeping easily at night,'' Lapointe said.</TEXT></DOC>
