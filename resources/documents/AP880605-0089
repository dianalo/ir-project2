(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The race is on to develop new tools thatcan make the tiny silicon microchips that will run futuregenerations of computers.   ``The prize will be the entire world electronics market of 1996and beyond,'' said John D. Wiley, associate dean of the Universityof Wisconsin's College of Engineering in Madison.   With West German and Japanese electronics firms already jockeyingfor position, an electronic storage ring may just be the best toolAmerican industry will need to keep pace.   The special device can produce finely etched computer chips, theguts of the electronics industry. But building a new one fromscratch could cost $15 million to $20 million, an hefty investmenteven for a large company.   Yet in a cluttered metal building overlooking Lake Kegonsa, theUniversity of Wisconsin is operating its own ring, dubbed Aladdin,and is willing to make the device available for industrial research.   Chips now are manufactured by a process known as lithography, inwhich the myriad of components on a chip are printed on the waferthrough the use of light-sensitive films and etching chemicals.   Aladdin, which is 80-feet in diameter and uses as muchelectricity as a small town, can apply 800 million volts of spin toelectrons to produce the ``soft'' x-rays that will allow even fineretching of computer chips than ultraviolet light can accomplish.   The only other storage ring in the country that produces softx-rays is at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.,and it is booked solid.   Last week, only 17 of Aladdin's 36 available beam lines were inuse, and the University hopes industry snatches up some of thosestill available.   University scientists say it is time for Aladdin to do industrialresearch as well as academic research in x-ray lithography.   The Japanese have spent an estimated $1 billion to develop thetechnology needed to build the new generation of smaller computerchips, said University physicist David Huber, who is in charge ofAladdin.   In the United States, Congress appropriated $15 million for suchresearch last year and is expected to provide $35 million this year,Huber said.   Among private companies in the United States, only computer giantIBM has invested significantly in the technology, and even itrealizes it cannot carry the research burden alone, he said.   ``There are 15 new rings now under construction in Japan. Thereis only one being built in this country,'' Wiley said. He said theGermans have had a thriving applied research program in x-raylithography since 1978.   ``If we don't play a role, it's unlikely this country is going toembrace the technology,'' Huber said.   ``Assuming the much earlier and larger Japanese and Europeaninvestments do not render our program irrelevant before it getsstarted,'' Wiley said, ``the U.S. may actually have a chance toregain a competitive position in this technology.''</TEXT></DOC>
