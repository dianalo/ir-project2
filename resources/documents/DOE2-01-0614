<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-01-0614 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors analyze the connection between nonlinear sigma models self-dualYang-Mills theory, and general relativity (self-dual and non-self-dual,with and without killing vectors), both at the level of the equationsand at the level of the different type of solutions (solitons and calorons)of these theories. They give a manifestly gauge invariant formulationof the self-dual gravitational field analogous to that given by Yangfor the self-dual Yang-Mills field. This formulation connects in a directand explicit way the self-dual Yang-Mills and the general relativityequations. They give the &quot;R gauge&quot; parametrization of the self-dual gravitationalfield (which corresponds to modified Yang's-type and Ernst equations)and analyze the correspondence between their different types of solutions.No assumption about the existence of symmetries in the space-time isneeded. For the general case (non-self-dual), they show that the Einsteinequations contain an O nonlinear sigma model. This connection with thesigma model holds irrespective of the presence of symmetries in the space-time.They found a new class of solutions of Einstein equations depending onholomorphic and antiholomorphic functions and we relate some subclassesof these solutions to solutions of simpler nonlinear field equationsthat are well known in other branches of physics, like sigma models,SineGordon, and Liouville equations. They include gravitational planewave solutions. They analyze the response of different accelerated quantumdetector models, compare them to the case when the detectors are linterialin an ordinary Planckian gas at a given temperature, and discuss theanisotropy of the detected response for Rindler observers.</TEXT></DOC>
