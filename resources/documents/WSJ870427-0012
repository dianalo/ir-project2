The Ex-Im Bank's new &quot;foreign-content&quot; rules will allow U.S. manufacturers and their foreign customers to arrange either direct Ex-Im Bank loans or guarantees of private credits for products where the foreign-content parts may total as much as 50% of the value of the finished product.    The final assembly will have to be completed at factories in the U.S.    Until now, the Ex-Im Bank has said it wouldn't consider approving export loans or guarantees of commercial bank credits for U.S. exports where the value of foreign parts exceeded 15% of the price for the finished product.    The policy change, to take effect Friday, doesn't mean the export credit agency will approve loans or credit guarantees covering the foreign-content parts of U.S. exports. But Ex-Im officials said they will be willing to finance as much as 100% of the &quot;U.S.-content&quot; of products assembled from parts made in the U.S. and abroad, provided the financing package doesn't exceed 85% of the total price for the finished product to be sold to a foreign buyer. Also, the U.S. content must not represent less than 50% of the price, the Ex-Im Bank said.    Ex-Im Bank officials said the change was sought by U.S. companies that use foreign parts in industrial equipment and other capital goods intended for export. </TEXT></DOC>
