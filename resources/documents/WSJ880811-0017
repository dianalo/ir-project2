Some economists and other analysts predicted that the central bank could raise its discount rate later this month if the dollar continues to soar. Moreover, Japan is alone among the big economic powers in resisting higher rates; the Fed's action Tuesday followed recent official rate increases in Britain and West Germany.    The Nikkei stock index lost 615.49 points, or 2.2%, to 27554.87. Trading was slow, with turnover of only 700 million shares on the first section, up from Tuesday's 650 million. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index closed at 2172.80, down 47.49.    The Nikkei started on a rebound today. At the close of the morning session, it was up 127.52, to 27682.39.    The discount rate is the rate charged by a central bank on loans to financial institutions. While shifts in a discount rate often lag behind changes in interbank or commercial interest rates, they are an important indicator of the long-term direction of interest rates.    Market watchers said that for now, the Bank of Japan's monetary policy is focusing predominantly on exchange rates and the possible inflationary effects that could result from a decline in the value of the yen. Most of Japan's imports are denominated in dollars, and any increase in the dollar's value would likely bring higher prices at home.    The dollar already is hovering just below its 1988 high of 135.70 yen. Economists said that if the U.S. currency moves significantly above that level, the Bank of Japan could be forced to consider raising its official rates to complement a recent but gradual tightening of interbank rates.    &quot;The most important question for the Bank of Japan is what happens to the dollar,&quot; said Kermit Schoenholtz, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;Generally speaking, it affects domestic policy, and domestic policy issues occupy center stage in Japan.&quot;    Officially, Japan's monetary stance remains restrained. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who has opposed Bank of Japan intervention in currency markets to support the yen, said after the U.S. rate increase that he sees no need for a shift in Japan's monetary policy. Kyodo News Service quoted him as saying that the dollar's steep rise was &quot;not violent,&quot; implying that there is no immediate need to adjust rates in Japan.    The Fed's half-point increase, which brought the U.S. discount rate to 6.5%, its highest level in more than two years, caught Japanese financial markets off guard. &quot;Nobody predicted this,&quot; said Richard Koo, an economist at Nomura Securities Co.'s research unit. &quot;A lot of people are back at the drawing board trying to make sense of this move.&quot;    But despite Wednesday's drop, some Japanese stock analysts remain optimistic. Katsumi Nishikido, a senior analyst at Nippon Kanyo Kakumaru Securities Co., said, &quot;The basic upward trend in the market hasn't changed yet.&quot;    Hisao Suzuki, a senior analyst at Nikko Securities Co., argued that even if the Bank of Japan raises its official discount rate from 2.5% now, Japan's interest rate level would remain very low. Analysts also pointed out the market is gradually shifting its buying interest to shares of companies with improved earnings prospects, and away from companies benefiting from low interest rates.    And despite the fresh impetus provided by the Fed's rate increase, many analysts said they believe Japanese authorities still have ample room to maneuver without resorting to a discount rate increase.    &quot;The U.S. discount rate rise doesn't necessarily mean the Bank of Japan will hike its discount rate,&quot; said Teruo Shinato, a money market economist at Fuji Bank. But he added that the Fed's action clears away a possible obstacle to a matching move by Japan. Since the October stock market crash, Japanese authorities have been wary of leading the U.S. in official rate increases for fear of aggravating market jitters.    Japan's robust economy has yet to show signs of inflation. In the first half of 1988, according to estimates by Nomura, the economy grew 7.3%, while consumer prices edged up only about 0.5%.    But the absence of imminent inflationary pressures in Japan doesn't mean the Bank of Japan won't raise rates. In fact, many factors could force the central bank's hand soon.    Aside from the inflationary threat that could be posed by a significantly weaker yen, the most crucial factor is the widening gap between short-term money market and interbank rates and Japan's official discount rate, which has stood at 2.5% since April 1987.    On Wednesday, the Bank of Japan allowed money brokers to raise the one-month interbank rate 0.125 point to 4.125%. Three-month certificates of deposit now bear interest of between 4.9% and 5%.    When interbank rates rise, commercial banks put pressure on the Bank of Japan to raise the discount rate. The prime lending rate is tied by law to the discount rate, so when interbank rates rise, the margin narrows between commercial banks' cost of funds -- the interbank market rate -- and the rate at which they lend money to their best customers, the prime lending rate.    Interbank and money market rates may move still higher next month, when many Japanese corporations close their financial years. Bankers said corporate funds shortages in September often push up rates. </TEXT></DOC>
