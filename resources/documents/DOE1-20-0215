It followsthat broken sypersymmetry is never restored at higher T. When supersymmetryis manifest at T = O, it is not automatically broken at T not equal toO. It is also demonstrated, by explicit examples, that when supersymmetryis spontaneously broken at T not equal to O, there always exists a masslessGoldstone fermion.</TEXT></DOC>
