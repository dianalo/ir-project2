Police responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. At least fivepolicemen, three Palestinians and several journalists were hurt.   The hour-long battle on Temple Mount _ known to Moslems as Haramal Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary _ was the worst violence in a year atthe third holiest site of Islam. Clouds of tear gas rose from thehilltop in Jerusalem's Old City dominated by the Al Aqsa and Domeof the Rock mosques.   A leaflet distributed by the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas (Zeal)movement urged Palestinians to welcome Ramadan by escalating their16-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bankand Gaza Strip.   At least 37 Palestinians were arrested. Police commander YosefYehudai said most were from the West Bank and Arab east Jerusalem.   A similar protest occurred at Hebron in the West Bank. Hundredsof worshipers chanting nationalist slogans stoned soldiers, whoopened fire, wounding four Palestinians. The army put the cityunder curfew.   Jewish settlers in Hebron hurled stones at Arab-owned vehicles,retaliating for similar Arab attacks, Israel radio said.   In Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot and wounded two Palestinianteen-agers during a riot, Arab hospital officials said.   The violence came one day after President Bush supported PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for residents of the occupiedlands to elect representatives to negotiate with Israel.   Influential Palestinians greeted the idea coolly and said itmust be part of a broader program, including promises to end theoccupation and trade land for peace. Israel captured the West Bankand Gaza from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.   Hanna Siniora, editor of the daily Al Fajr, said the uprising,in which 420 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been slain, wouldcontinue ``until Shamir comes up with a better proposal.''   His paper supports the Palestine Liberation Organization, withwhich Israel refuses to deal.   While Siniora and other moderates expressed skepticism aboutShamir's motivation, they left the door open to furtherdiscussions. Palestinian hard-liners ruled out elections.   Shamir said on Israel radio Friday there ``appears to be a fullunderstanding'' between him and Bush. He made little of theirdifferences, including Bush's call for an end to Israeli occupation.   Rioting began in Jerusalem after about 25,000 worshipersattended noon prayers on the first day of Ramadan, the Moslem monthof daytime fasting and religious fervor.   Israeli officials have expressed fear of an escalation of theuprising during Ramadan, which marks the month the prophet Mohammedbegan receiving the holy Koran from Allah.   Al Aqsa is an important national symbol to Palestinians and theDome of the Rock marks the spot from which, in Islamic belief,Mohammed ascended to heaven on his horse.   The 35-acre rectangular platform on which the mosque coplex isbuilt also is the site of the ancient Jewish Temple, the holiestshrine of Judaism, which the Romans destroyed in the year 70.   About 4,000 worshipers stayed behind in the mosque complex afterprayers Friday, police said.   They chanted ``Allahu Akbar!'' _ ``God is great!'' _ and``Palestine is Moslem!'' They also waved five larged Palestinianflags and burned two Israeli flags. Palestinian flags are illegalin Israel.   At first, only a few Palestinians threw stones at the hundredsof police arrayed outside the courtyard walls. Then a policemanfired a shot into the air.   ``This shot led to the great confusion,'' said Moshe Nussbaum,an Israel radio reporter. ``Seconds after the shot was fired, wewere barraged by stones.''   Rocks pelted dozens of journalists who had observed the prayersfrom an adjacent rooftop.   Wolfgang Scheider, a cameraman for Austrian TV, was struck inthe head and collapsed, blood streaming down his face.   Police fired rubber bullets and hundreds of tear gas canistersover the wall, then entered to arrest demonstrators.   At the Wailing Wall, which lines one side of the complex, theground was littered with stones. The area was devoid of the Jewishworshipers who normally crowd the site.   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said: ``If they continue to exploitthe Temple Mount's sanctity for riots and harm worship at theWestern (Wailing) Wall, Israel will know how to deal with them.''   Police said they would increase security and keep somePalestinians away from mosques.</TEXT></DOC>
