The 51-member assembly deliberated eight hours before voting44-2 for the cease-fire.   Prime Minister Henk Arron said disputes with the army over theterms of the accord had been overcome. He said the truce will beimplemented within the next weeks after the final wording is puttogether.   The Surinamese military, which ruled the country until 1987, hadprotested provisions of the agreement that allow the rebels to keeptheir weapons and eventually join the South American nation'spolice force.   The government and rebels agreed in principle to the accord onJuly 22 at a meeting in French Guiana.   It was to end the fighting in eastern Suriname betweengovernment forces and the rebels, led by Ronnie Brunswijk, 27, aformer bodyguard to Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse who ruled Suriname from1980-1987.   Bouterse was replaced by a civilian government in 1987elections, but the army still has influence in Surinamese politicsunder a state of emergency in large parts of the nation.   The truce also calls for an end to the state of emergency andfor an aid program for eastern Suriname, where Brunswijk has hispower base.   The three-year strife, which is seen as a personal feud betweenBrunswijk and Bouterse, has cost hundreds of lives.   Suriname, a nation of 400,000, gained independence from Hollandin 1975.</TEXT></DOC>
