Beginningwith an initial polarization behavior based on temperature and flow conditions,the method uses the ADINAT finite element heat transfer program to calculatethe current distribution at time zero. A new set of polarization characteristicsis calculated for each element based on flow, present current density,and past history of the element for the next time step. ADINAT then usesthis new information to evaluate the current distribution at this nexttime step. The process repeats for the desired total time modeled inthe run.</TEXT></DOC>
