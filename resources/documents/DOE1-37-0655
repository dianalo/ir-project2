Osteochondromas and enchondromas were not included.Our material consisted of 16 patients with common tumours (3 Ewing'ssarcoma, 5 aneurysmal bone cyst, 6 osteoid osteoma and 2 epithelioma)and 5 patients with uncommon tumours (osteoma, simple bone cyst, haemangiopericytoma,capillary angiomatous tumour and benign ossifying fibroma or osteoblastoma).The X-ray diagnosis of the common tumours should have high concordancewith histology, whereas that of uncommon tumours in much more difficultand uncertain. The characteristic features of Ewing's sarcoma are stressedas all our children with this tumour had a delayed diagnosis and a fataloutcome. Differential diagnosis with other short tubular bone lesionsof the hand - specifically osteomyelitis - is discussed and the posibilitiesof microscopic diagnosis are stressed.</TEXT></DOC>
