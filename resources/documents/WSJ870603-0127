The frustration these companies experienced in finding support for their exports is regrettable, but they did accomplish their objectives through their own entrepreneurial spirit and with a pre-export guarantee of Ex-Im Bank.    Spurred by a new legislative mandate and a major effort to whet the appetite for export finance, Ex-Im Bank completed and launched on May 1 the most thorough overhaul of its export-financing programs in more than 25 years. These new programs are designed to reengage the U.S. banking system in support of exports.    The new Ex-Im Bank stands ready to assume more foreign risk in financing exports through improved coverage in 53 of the 139 countries to which it lends, and a greatly improved guarantee of export loans. It is more user-friendly: accessible to any responsible party seeking to finance a U.S. export, with greatly simplified paper work and a can-do attitude on the part of its staff. It has been spreading the word about its improved export-finance programs throughout the country, and has certified more than 300 banks as qualified to support export transactions.    John A. Bohn Jr.   President and Chairman   U.S. Export-Import Bank   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
