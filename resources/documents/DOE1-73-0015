In 33 patients who had angina pectoris withtriple vessel disease (TVD), stress myocardial planar scans were analyzedto evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of scanning. Thirty patients withsingle vessel disease (SVD) were selected as controls. Significantlyhigher lung thallium uptake and lower double product were observed inthe group of TVD than the group of SVD. For SVD, there was no significantdifference in the sensitivity of visual and quantitative analyses (93%vs 97%). In detecting TVD, the sensitivity of quantitative analysis wassignificantly higher than that of visual analysis (55% vs 6%). The detectionof deseased branches for TVD was higher in the following order: leftanterior descending branch andgt; right coronary artery andgt; left circumflexbranch, with significantly higher sensitivity of quantitative than visualanalysis (77% vs 41%). Thallium perfusion defect with incomplete redistributionwas observed in 17 SVD patients (57%) and 15TVD patients (45%), althoughthere was no association of infarct in this series. This implies thelimitations of thallium planar scanning in the differentiation of infarctand ischemia. (Namekawa, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
