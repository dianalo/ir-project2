A statistical approach was used to analyzecore-plug porosity and permeability measurements and then discriminatebetween significantly different rock types. A successive re-scaling procedurewas then adopted in which we first calculated effective values for eachrock type from the core-plug data. These results were then combined withthe statistics of the spatial distribution of the rock types in orderto calculate effective values for the non-shale part of each layer. Finally,the effect of the shales on the vertical permeability was incorporated.The resulting anisotropy ratios, of order 10/sup -3/, were used successfullyin black oil model studies to match observed production data with simulatorpredictions.</TEXT></DOC>
