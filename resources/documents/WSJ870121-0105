The recalculations provide new ammunition for advocates of oil import tariffs and point out the complexities of predicting oil production. According to the new numbers from the Department of Energy's statistics arm, the rate of domestic oil output dropped more than twice the previously estimated amount.    New figures show that domestic production during December averaged 8.3 million barrels a day, about 682,000 barrels less than 1985. The agency previously calculated that December production averaged 8.7 million barrels a day, or 319,000 barrels less than a year earlier.    While some industry compilations had suggested a sharp falloff in domestic production, the earlier benchmark government data indicated that output was curiously resistant to the last year's plunge in oil prices.    &quot;It's fair to say that everyone was misled for awhile&quot; by the numbers, says Willam D. Hermann, chief economist of Chevron Corp.    Proponents of an oil import tariff have been quick to jump on the new statistics as support for their position that domestic oil prices must be stabilized to avoid a plunge in U.S. production. &quot;We are optimistic that the revisions will send a message to the Reagan Administration and to the Congress that the situation is more serious than originally thought,&quot; says Raymond H. Hefner, chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which advocates an import levy.    The miscalculations through most of 1986 stemmed from the Energy Department's practice of projecting oil production using past trends. The system, which worked well when prices were fairly constant, was thrown awry by last year's sudden price drop, department officials said.    Government practice is to issue production estimates through the year and then to adjust the numbers at the end of the year using detailed reports from oil-producing states, said Craig Cranston of the Energy Information Administration's Office of Oil and Gas. The administration is the statistical arm of the Energy Department.    The delay in reconciling the state reports with the agency's estimates meant that the Energy Department continued to report erroneous data for months after more accurate numbers were available. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group that also reports on oil production, has consistently reported a sharper decline in domestic oil output.    Industry analysts say the Energy Department's correction may have a substantial impact. &quot;We're not talking about a small amount of oil,&quot; says Philip K. Verleger Jr., a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based research group. Mr. Verleger notes that the difference in revisions amounts to just under 1% of world oil output. &quot;Someone was asleep at the switch,&quot; he adds.    Mr. Cranston of the Energy Information Administration says that the department plans to change its procedures shortly. Among other things, it may reconcile its estimates with state data as soon as the state information is available. While some oil-producing states are notoriously slow to report, Alaska, for instance, reports within a month.&quot;Clearly there is room for improvement,&quot; Mr. Cranston said.    The sensitivity of oil production to price has been a major question for the government and the industry. As prices decline, oil-field operators may delay maintenance, allowing the output to decline. Moreover, certain wells cost so much to operate that it may simply not be economical to operate them when oil prices plunge. These generally are shut down. Just how much production is affected by these factors has been a topic of considerable debate.    One industry analyst says that the Energy Department's revisions may yet need further adjustments to reflect a continued decline in production compared with the previous year. &quot;The last three months' data look as though they're moving sideways,&quot; says Richard Sparling, director of Economic and Financial Studies at the Independent Petroleum Association of America.    Mr. Sparling says that increases in oil prices in recent weeks may have forestalled further slowdowns in production. However, he notes that changes in federal tax law would have encouraged oil-field operators to close wells before Dec. 31, in order to take tax losses in 1986, suggesting that, overall oil production may have declined further. </TEXT></DOC>
