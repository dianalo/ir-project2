In Wednesday's general election, Lubbers' Christian DemocraticAppeal party maintained its 54 seats in the 150-member Parliament,remaining the body's largest single party.   Traditionally, the largest legislative grouping gets thepremiership and Lubbers, the country's longest-serving premier in 30years, seemed certain of a third term.   Voters dealt a blow to Lubbers' errant junior partner in thecenter-right coalition, the right-wing Liberals, who in May toppledthe government over how to finance a long-term cleanup of theenvironment.   The Liberals, perceived by many voters as anti-environmentalist,lost five of their 27 seats on Wednesday.   The opposition Labor Party lost three seats in the voting,keeping 49.   It remained the second-largest force in Parliament but failed torally the left-of-center vote around its platform of economic growthand redistribution of wealth among the 3 million people living onwelfare outlays.   The Green Left, an impromptu coalition of left-wing fringeparties, doubled its parliamentary contingent Wednesday to six seatsand the traditionally environmentalist Democrats '66 party won 12seats, a gain of three.   The remainder of seats went to small right-wing fringe parties.   The electoral blow to the Liberals and the surge in support forgreen parties clearly indicated voter concern over ecological issues.   Earlier this year, Lubbers' government adopted a far-reaching,multibillion-dollar plan to clean up the environment in this nationthat has been dubbed ``the garbage can of Western Europe.'' Thecountry is located on the estuary of the Rhine, Europe's primeindustrial waste artery.   But the Liberals, under pressure from its affluent constituency,rejected the proposed abolition of a tax break for car commuters.The revenue was to finance the $3.3 billion clean-up over the nextfour years.   The governing coalition that will now emerge is difficult topredict, and building it is expected to take months. Lubbers saidWednesday that it was possible to form a coalition with either theright or the left.   Aske whether he would accept the Liberals as future coalitionpartners, Lubber said he ``shouldn't exclude any party beforehand.''   But he also told Dutch Television ``I see no reason why wecouldn't get together'' with the Labor Party, despite majordifferences over government austerity and industrial revitalization.   A continued alliance between the Christian Democrats and theLiberals, favored by the predominant part of both parties'constituencies, appears less likely because such a coupling wouldhave just a one-seat majority.   But hammering out a center-left coalition of Christian Democratsand Labor would be difficult because of the wide chasm on pressingissues.   Most prominent among them was how much those on welfare wouldshare wealth generated by an economy that has recovered partly byslashing social security outlays.   Other divisive issues included defense, with Labor opposed tomodernizing NATO's nuclear arsenals and the Christian Democrats infavor, and euthanasia, which Lubbers' party wants to ban and Laborwants to legalize.   The Christian Democrats' strong showing proved overwhelming votersupport for Lubbers' policy of economic austerity and fiscal reform.   The economy is expanding at a healthy 2.5 percent annual clip, upfrom near zero when Lubbers rose to power seven years ago. Consumerspending is growing 2.25 percent yearly, compared to minus 10percent earlier in the decade.   Lubbers has scheduled income tax cuts of $1.8 billion annually,beginning next year.</TEXT></DOC>
