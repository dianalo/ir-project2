Winston Lord, the U.S. ambassador in Beijing, informed Chineseauthorities about the U.S. decision to retaliate against Iran for amine explosion that damaged an American warship, and discussed theissue with Chinese authorities, said the U.S. officials, speakingon condition of anonymity.   The United States has been pushing other Security Councilmembers to enact an arms embargo against Iran for refusing toaccept a call by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar fora truce in the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war.   While lobbying for the embargo, the United States has beenseeking continuous reassurances from China that it will notexercise its veto power if the rest of the U.N. Security Councilapproves the ban.   Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian said during a visit toWashington last month that his government thought the ban was apoor idea, but would not block it.   In their latest comments, the Chinese repeated their view thatan arms embargo would be a mistake and expressed concern that theclashes in the gulf are creating an improper atmosphere for Perezde Cuellar's mediation efforts, the officials said.   The Chinese did not say point blank they would veto an armsembargo, one official said. Nevertheless, he said, some U.S.government experts believe the Chinese comments may represent astep away from their earlier vow of passivity.   China's concern about an Iranian arms embargo is more thandiplomatic. Its arms industry has sold billions of dollars ofweapons to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war, notably Silkwormanti-ship missiles that have been fired at vessels in the PersianGulf.   The officials noted that China's view on the arms embargoremains a moot point because the Soviet Union _ another member ofthe Security Council _ has refused to go along at all. The latestrefusal came on Friday during Secretary of State George P. Shultz'talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow.   ``You could argue it's not totally clear what the Chinese willdo,'' one official said. ``But at this point it doesn't seem tomake much difference because the Soviets are still clearly opposedto the resolution.''</TEXT></DOC>
