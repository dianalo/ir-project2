Anybody could doit, and many did.   Everybody talked about the weather, especially farmers and theirneighbors. There was talk about hard times, too, and how it seemednobody was doing anything about it.   If times were good, farmers kept their mouths shut, knowing thatanother drought or something bad was right around the corner.   Not much was heard about economic forecasts, though. Somebody inthe government or a big-shot financier occasionally said something,but scientifically developed projections did not abound.   Today's economic forecasting, once as primitive as predictingthe weather from the loops in chicken entrails, has come a longway, to be sure. But agricultural economists still have theirproblems with weather, the greatest single variable confrontingfarmers.   And the agricultural economist's weather map is a lot biggerthese days, global, in fact. Hundreds of people in the AgricultureDepartment, for example, look at and analyze world weatherconditions.   Clark Edwards of the department's Economic Research Service saysweather isn't the only guidepost. Domestic and foreign polices ofother countries, demand trends, population growth and economicgrowth are all part of the package.   Farmers have little defense against ``uncertain events'' thatoccur because of government actions or as a result of majorvariations in world weaher patterns, he said. That was evidentduring the agricultural boom of the 1970s and the bust of the 1980s.   ``Who could have foretold the devastatingly late and poormonsoon in Asia and its effect on the 1987 crop and on worldprices?'' Edwards said. ``What farmer could have said in the early1980s, `I choose to farm in an economy with a larger money supplyand therefore with lower interest rates'?''   Edwards added: ``Because of the unpredictability of major eventsthat affect the national and international agricultural economies,it is getting harder to know how to use economic forecasts.''   One solution would be to simply accept a forecast and actaccordingly. Farmers often do that when dealing about events andprocesses with which they are familiar, he said. The likelyresponse of corn yields to fertilizer applications, or milk yieldsin response to feeding rates are examples.   And some economic forecasts are hedged by giving users a set ofpossible outcomes that illustrate the uncertainties. For example,the agency's forecast of net cash farm income this year is in arange of $50 billion to $55 billion.   ``A farm equipment manufacturer for whom this forecast isimportant might determine then consequences if the actual outcomeis at one end of the range or the other, and then attach a degreeof confidence to each of the two outcomes,'' Edwards said. ``Usingthis information, a manager can work out the best position to take.This is one way to allow for known risks.''   But Edwards acknowledged in an article published in the Mayissue of Agricultural Outlook magazine that it is getting harderfor farmers to make decisions when they are increasingly faced byuncertainties caused by events which they can neither predict norcontrol.   ``Greater exposure to these uncertainties has come along withU.S. farmers' increasing dependence on world markets,'' he said.``Two major sources of risk ... are climatic events in otherhemispheres and the policies and actions of governments.''   A classic example of a global influence on American farmers isthe Soviet Union. Since 1972, when Moscow secretly bought theequivalent of one-fourth of that year's U.S. wheat crop, weather inthe Soviet Union has been watched almost as intently as it is inKansas and Iowa.   The huge 1972 purchases led to a bilateral agreement severalyears later, pledging the Soviet Union to buy U.S. wheat and cornon a sustained annual basis. That was one attempt to soften some ofthe variables connected with the export trade.   ``United States and Soviet government policy changes canexacerbate the effect that Russian weather patterns have on U.S.wheat producers,'' Edwards said. ``There was a time when theU.S.S.R. tended to tighten its collective belt after a short crop.Now the Soviets are more likely to seek imports to stabilize theirlivestock economy, with larger needs in some years and smallerneeds in others.''   The Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, is a more recent exampleof the U.S. government trying to soften some of the variables forAmerican farmers by providing subsidies of taxpayer-owned surplusgrain to exporters so they can sell wheat and other designatedcommodities to selected foreign buyers, including the Soviet Union,at bargain prices.   Other USDA activities, such as the Targeted Export Asssistanceprogram, or TEA, help promote U.S. commodities in foreign markets.   It's all part of the forecasting business and must be taken intoconsideration when department economists make predictions.   ``Still, farmers' plans based on forecasts can receive as greata shock from, say, the weather affecting the soybean crop in SouthAmerica this May and June as from the weather on their own farm,''Edwards said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 8</NOTE></DOC>
