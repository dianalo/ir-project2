(``CBOE''or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),pursuant to section 19(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934(``Act'') \1\<NOTE/> and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,\2\<NOTE/> a proposed rule change that would clarify existing indexexercise advice procedures and require that such advice forms be submittedfor all index option contracts that are to be exercised. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 17 CFR 240.19b-4(1986).The proposed rule change was noticed in Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 25209, 52 FR 49557 (December 31, 1987). The COBE amended its filingon January 13, 1988. No comments were received on the proposed rule change.The CBOE contends that violations of Rule 11.1 have occurred due to thecomplexity of the rule regarding the calculation of the quantity for whichan exercise advice was to be submitted and the requirements for time stampingexercise instruction memoranda and advice forms. \3\<NOTE/> In this regard, the CBOE states that the purpose of the proposedrule change is to rewrite the rule to provide additional clarity to theExchange's index advice procedures. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Under existing Rule 11.1, Interpretation and Policy. 02,member organizations intending to submit an exercise notice for 25 or moreindex option contracts in the same series on the same day on behalf ofan individual customer, market maker or firm account must deliver an exerciseadvice form prescribed by CBOE at a place designated by CBOE by 3:15 p.m.Chicago Times. The calculation of the quantity to exercise involves aggregationaccounts under common control, even though each of the aggregated individualaccounts did not exercise more than 24 contracts. For members intendingto exercise fewer than 25 index option contracts in the same series onthe same business day on behalf of an individual customers, market makeror firm account, however, the exercise notices need only be received orprepared by the member organization by 3:15 p.m. Under the proposed rule change, interpretation .02 of Rule 11.1 will requirethat an exercise instruction memoranda must be prepared and time stampedafter the contracts to be exercised have been purchased. It can not beprepared, time stamped, or submitted prior to the purchase of the contracts.Interpretation .03 of the proposed rule change contains the requirementthat an index exercise advice must be submitted for all index option contractsthat are to be exercised. The procedures for cancelling such advices andthe requirements regarding time stamped are also explained. In addition,Interpretation. 03 provides that the failure of any member to follow theExchange's index advice procedures may be referred to the Business ConductCommittee and result in the assessment of a fine, which may include butis not limited to a disgorgement of potential economic gain obtained orloss avoided by the subject exercise. Finally, on January 13, 1988, theExchange submitted to the Commission a proposed amendment to Interpretation.03 of the proposed rule change. The proposed amendment provides that ifthe close of trading of such index options shall be at a time other than3:15 p.m. (Chicago Time) the rule would permit exercise and submissionof exercise notices until the designated close. The Exchange states thatthe purpose of the proposed amendment is to clarify further the intentof the existing and proposed rule that cash-settled index options may notbe exercised and exercise advices may not be delivered after the closeof trading. Interpretation .04 of the proposed rule change reiterates that the exercisecut off time for index option contracts shall be 5:30 p.m. (Chicago Time)on the business day prior to expiration. Interpretation .05, which is new, states that the existing Exchange interpretationconcerning the cut-off time provision for exercise advice forms is subjectto the authority of the Exchange to halt trading, open trading, and conductrotations. Thus, if trading is halted, the proposed rule change providesthat the Exchange may restrict exercises, and if trading is extended, (forexample, for a closing trading rotation under Rule 6.2), exercise adviceforms may be received during such a rotation.The CBOE states that the statutory basis for the proposed rule change issection 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to enforce just and equitableprinciples of trade. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with therequirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicableto a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirementsof section 6,\4\<NOTE/> and the rules and regulations thereunder. More specifically,the Commission believes that the proposed rule change will clarify theExchange's index advice procedures without changing the intent of the previousrule. Requiring the submission of exercise advice forms for all index optionsbeing exercised will eliminate confusion among member firms as to exactlywhen said notices must be submitted.\5\<NOTE/> As a result, the CBOE expects that non-compliance with theprovisions of Rule 11.1 because of confusion should be reduced or eliminated.At the same time, the new rule change will not increase substantially theburden on members to file notices, as members currently must prepare noticesfor exercises of less than 25 contracts. The proposed change will onlyrequire members to file them with the Exchange. In addition, the Commissionhas not received any comments objecting to the proposed change. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 15 U.S.C. 78f (1982). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ In light of the heavy trading volume of option contractson the Sandamp;P 100 (OEX), the new rule will simplify the Exchange's policyfor the exercise of index option contracts, and more specifically optionson OEX. In this regard, the rule change will eliminate the complexity ofthe rule regarding the calculation of the quantity for which an exerciseadvice is to be submitted, and instead require the submission of such advicesfor all exercises. Moreover, although the exchange's policy consistently has been to prohibitsubmission of exercise notices before the options being exercised are purchased,the Commission agrees that it is logical for the Exchange to state expresslythat submission of exercise notices before the index option positions beingexercised are purchased is a violation of the rule. The Exchange will beable to detect incidents where exercise notices were submitted before theindex options actually were purchased because all notices must be timestamped. <T3>It is therefore ordered,</T3> pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\6\<NOTE/> that the proposed rule change is approved.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.\7\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12) (1986).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 5, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Shirley E.
