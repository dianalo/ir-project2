Chamberlin resigned as president, chief operating officer and a director of Avon Products Inc., apparently dissatisfied with the company's change in strategy to reemphasize its core beauty business.    Mr. Chamberlin was considered the leading candidate to succeed Chairman Hicks Waldron, who plans to retire within the next year. Mr. Chamberlin, 59 years old, couldn't be reached for comment. An Avon spokesman said that the company was aware &quot;for some time&quot; of Mr. Chamberlin's plans to resign. In 1987, Avon restructured and has been gradually returning its focus to its main beauty business. It has been shedding parts of its sluggish home health-care businesses and has sold its catalog clothing division.    Mr. Chamberlin, whom the spokesman called a &quot;retail consumer marketing expert,&quot; formerly was chairman and chief executive officer of Lenox Inc., a Brown-Forman Corp. division that makes fine china and crystal.    He joined Avon in 1985 when the company was pursuing plans to diversify into health care and other areas. &quot;He found the narrower focus of the company less satisfying,&quot; Avon's spokesman said.    Mr. Chamberlin will be succeeded by James E. Preston, 54, executive vice president of Avon's beauty division and a director of the parent. Industry analysts believe that Mr. Preston now becomes the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Waldron, 64.    Mr. Preston, who joined Avon in 1964, led the expansion of the company's worldwide beauty business, which he has headed for the past seven years.    Avon made the announcement after the stock market closed Friday. Avon's stock closed in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $23.375 a share, up 12.5 cents.    Industry analysts were surprised that Mr. Chamberlin resigned. Jack Salzman of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. noted that Avon's &quot;dissolving of its the health-care businesses made Mr. Chamberlin and Mr. Waldron come to a head.&quot; He believes that Mr. Preston now is the &quot;odds-on favorite&quot; to succeed Mr. Waldron.    Mr. Salzman noted that &quot;this is a difficult time for Avon . . . the health care business is under major earnings pressure,&quot; and the company has been having difficulty finding a buyer for its Foster Medical Home Health division.    Avon said last week that it would cut 200 employees at its headquarters here, saving $20 million a year before taxes and helping to streamline operations. Avon earlier disclosed that its first-half earnings are going to be &quot;terrible,&quot; partly because of currency devaluations in Brazil and Mexico.    ---   Avon Sued by Shareholder   NEW YORK -- A shareholder suit alleged that a share-purchase rights plan, or poison pill, adopted by Avon Products Inc. is a &quot;breach of fiduciary duty&quot; and should be declared invalid.    The suit, filed by holder Harry B. Charal in New York state court, seeks class-action status. It alleges that the rights plan, adopted by the New York company March 31, will serve to &quot;entrench defendants in their remunerative positions as directors and officers.&quot;    Avon's directors as well as the company were named as defendants.    The suit contends that the rights plan if allowed to operate &quot;will obstruct and may preclude the realization (by plaintiffs) of the true value of their shares . . . by subverting the operation of the public market for Avon stock by preventing public tender offers and attempts to acquire control by other means at fair prices to the public shareholders.&quot;    A spokesman for Avon said: &quot;Avon's share rights plan wouldn't prevent a takeover, but it would enhance shareholder value in the event of a takeover.&quot; He added: &quot;Enhancing shareholder value is the board's primary fiduciary responsibility so we will vigorously defend the plan and expect to prevail.&quot;    Such rights plans typically are designed to discourage hostile suitors by allowing a company's shareholders to buy more stock in the target concern, or in the suitor itself at a discount, if a hostile bid occurs. </TEXT></DOC>
