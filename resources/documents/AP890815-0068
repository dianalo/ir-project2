The bloody assault ended a three-day standoff at the MetropolitanDistrict Command Detention Center and came five hours after theconvicts tried to flee by using hostages as shields.   During the attempted break, five hostages escaped but a16-year-old female captive died, along with one convict, officialssaid. The remaining 15 inmates then retreated to the jail compound.   Brig. Gen. Mariano Baccay, the regional military commander, saidofficials decided to storm the jail after the escaped hostages toldthem some captives had been slain.   In all, five hostages died. Baccay said none died in the policeassault.   The hostages were seized Sunday during religious services at thedowntown jail in Davao City, 610 miles southeast of Manila.   One of those slain was missionary Jacqueline Hamill, 36, ofSydney, Australian, who had been working in Davao City since lastmonth. Cecilia So, a nurse at Davao Doctors' Hospital, said MissHamill was pronounced dead on arrival after the assault.   All the hostages were members of the Joyful Assemblies of God, aProtestant group that conducted a prison ministry. The inmates,including murderers, asked for a getaway vehicle and gaveauthorities a 4 p.m. deadline to meet their demand.   Maj. Antonio Inciong of the military's Civil Relations Servicesaid Miss Hamill and other female captives were sexually molested bytheir captors. Officials said about nine of the hostages were women.   Military and civilian negotiators had been holding talks with theinmates since late Sunday in an effort to peacefully resolve thecrisis.   But about 10 a.m. today, military spokesman Maj. Wilfredo Garciasaid the inmates announced they were leaving the detention centerwith their prisoners.   ``The hostage takers started firing when they broke out,'' Garciasaid. ``Heavy firing ensued.''   Convict leader Mohammed Naser Samparani, a former air forcesoldier serving a 27-year sentence for murder, was killed in theattempted escape, along with hostage Julieta Verzosa, 16.   After the first burst of gunfire, the inmates remained holed upinside the compound until the military attacked. Before the assault,reporters could see four bodies, three male and one female, stackedup in the area controlled by the inmates. It appeared the four hadbeen slain after the breakout failed.   On Monday, former Rep. Jesus Dureza, who was negotiating with thegunmen, said Samparani threatened to ``waste all my bullets into theAustralian'' unless officials provided the convicts with a getawayvehicle.   There were conflicting reports about how the hostage drama began.Justice Undersecretary Silvestre Bello said the convicts overpowereda guard and then looted an armory for weapons.   But the Rev. Jamuel Ducurme, who had attended Sunday's prisonservices, said the incident began after Samparani, a prison trusty,asked to take food to the wife of a soldier who lived next to thejail.   Samparani returned a few moments later with an M-16 rifle, firedwarning shots and seized the hostages, Ducurme said. The pastor saidhe was allowed to leave.   Police said most of the inmates were believed to have been from agroup that escaped in April from the Davao Penal Colony and seizedseveral hostages to protest conditions at the prison.   They surrendered after being promised they would be transferredto the Muntinlupa prison, in a Manila suburb, but the promise wasnever fulfilled.   Officials said later the promised transfer could not be carriedout because the inmates faced additional charges in Davao City inconnection with the penal colony escape.</TEXT></DOC>
