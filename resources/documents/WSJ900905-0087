Iraqi crude.   Iraq might not be pleased with the disposition of thatshipment, but the U.S. is. Today it sits in a hugeunderground cavern here, part of America's 590-million-barrelinsurance policy in a global crisis Iraq brought on.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. policy makers take comfort in the confidence that ifthe crisis worsens and world oil supplies contract, thisStrategic Petroleum Reserve can be summoned at the stroke ofa presidential pen; its crude oil can be quickly and smoothlydistributed, refined and put to use fueling everything fromcars to home furnaces to factories.   Or at least that's the theory.   In practice, getting SPR oil into the hands of consumerswould be a formidable challenge. While strategists often talkof the petroleum reserve as if it could be turned on like awater tap, the reality is a vast and enormously complexsystem. Nobody says the reserve wouldn't work, but thecurrent crisis is raising a host of practical questions abouthow fast and reliably it could deliver.   Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil, some of it in storage for13 years, has been withdrawn and sold only once. That was a10-week, million-barrel test auction begun in late in 1985conducted under non-stressful conditions. This worries oilexecutives such as Leighton Steward, chairman of LouisianaLand andamp; Exploration Co. &quot;If you had a potential weapon youcould use -- that's what the SPR is, a weapon -- you wouldn'tgo to battle with it never tested,&quot; he says. Before there'sany turn for the worse in the Persian Gulf, he and otherssuggest, maybe the government should tap into the SPR to &quot;getout the bugs.&quot;   Among the bugs they see are these:   -- Two-thirds of petroleum-reserve oil is the wrong kindfor many U.S. refineries. It is &quot;sour&quot; crude containing somuch sulfur that if those plants tried to turn it intogasoline they could be ruined.   -- Equipment and physical problems have dogged the reservesince it was hastily set up in the mid-1970s. At one site,certain pipes have corroded and ruptured. Another $90 millionfacility may collapse inward as soon as oil is withdrawn.   -- If the SPR is opened, anyone with enough money will beable to buy its oil, including speculators who could hoardit, defeating the reserve's purpose.   -- Up to 10% of the oil can be allocated any way theEnergy Department sees fit, a rule that could spur apolitical free-for-all.   -- U.S. law says only American-flag tankers can move theoil about the country. So heavy drawdowns could mean adistribution bottleneck.   Officials of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve expressconfidence that they could handle such problems. Although&quot;it's predictable we'll have some operational difficulties,&quot;says the reserve's director, John Bartholomew, &quot;the SPRstands at its highest state of readiness ever.&quot; He says ithas been &quot;exercised&quot; more than 25 times in the past decade.But Randy Suhl, a crude oil analyst for LyondellPetrochemical Co. in Houston, says, &quot;The question is whetherthey can pump it at the rate they say they can.&quot;   At the moment, officials ranging from Washingtonpoliticians to Middle East oil ministers are debating whetheror when the ocean of oil buried in the SPR ought to betapped. The Iraq-Kuwait crisis and world embargo hassidelined four million barrels of daily oil production, andwhile other producers promise to fill most of that gap, theSPR could eliminate the rest. It could also offset any spotshortages in the coming heating season, and some experts saythat release of even small amounts of reserve oil would calmthe volatile petroleum markets. But so far thefree-market-oriented Bush administration isn't buying thesearguments.   The idea of a strategic oil reserve first popped up beforeWorld War I when Winston Churchill converted the British navyto oil from coal. But he never set one up, and neither didthe U.S. until after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. Congressauthorized the SPR a year later.   The government began pumping oil into it in 1977, but ittook another oil crunch to spur serious buying. In 1981, withprices soaring to more than $40 a barrel, SPR purchases hit aone-year record of 122.5 million barrels. Unfortunately, inthat scramble the government bought a lot of the mostaffordable oil, and that of course was the lowest grade.   Now the SPR is heavy on &quot;sour&quot; crude, which is harder toprocess than low-sulfur &quot;sweet.&quot; It also yields less perbarrel of the most popular products, such as high-octanegasoline. In fact, about 40% of the reserve is sour Mexicancrude. Some of that was bought for special reasons; a $1billion oil purchase in the early '80s was part of afinancial rescue of that country.   Many large refineries, such as Amoco's huge facility inTexas City, Texas, can process both sweet and sour crudes.But others can't: a Marathon Oil refinery in the same citydemands almost exclusively sweet crude. So do numerous othermajor oil refineries from Odessa, Texas, to El Dorado, Ark.Overall, about half the 6.9 million barrel-a-day refiningcapacity on the Gulf Coast and 50% of Midwest capacity isn'tsuited to sour crude, says Thomas Manning of Purvin andamp; GertzInc., an oil industry consultant.   &quot;I've only found three crudes {in the SPR} we could evenrun,&quot; says a worried official of the Indiana Farm BureauCooperative. (The reserve contains eight types of crude inall.) He fears supply problems for his 21,000 barrel-a-day,1940-vintage refinery. &quot;The metallurgy of our plant requiresa sweet crude. In a short time {sour crude} would eat up theplant,&quot; he says. The co-op supplies 50% of the fuel used byIndiana farmers.   Mr. Bartholomew, the director of the petroleum reserve,concedes that some refineries can't handle sour crude. But henotes that many are changing equipment, and also says thatthe SPR would never be the only source of oil, even in anemergency. &quot;Sometimes {refiners} think the SPR should be theanswer for anything,&quot; he complains.   SPR oil is stored in Texas and Louisiana in five giantsalt domes and one abandoned salt mine. A typical cavern isabout 200 feet in diameter and 2,000 feet high, or tallerthan the World Trade Center in New York. At the facility herein Bryan Mound, 50 miles south of Houston, 20 caverns havebeen hollowed out of a 10-mile-deep salt formation far belowthe marshy surface. Engineers make the caverns by drilling ahole and pouring in fresh water, thus dissolving some of thesalt, and then repeating the process to enlarge the cavity.Oil, unlike fresh water, doesn't dissolve the salt walls.   To retrieve stored oil, fresh water would be pumped inthrough a pipe leading to the bottom of the cavern. Then oil,which is lighter than water, would rise to the top and bepiped away. At Bryan Mound, it could be pumped 46 miles to aterminal on the Houston Ship Channel or four miles back tothe Phillips docks. Currently, this site, like the rest ofthe petroleum reserve, is on &quot;Alert Level Two&quot; and poised towithdraw oil, says Neil Packard, Department of Energy sitemanager. &quot;It works beautifully,&quot; he declares.   Apparently not all SPR sites are in such fine fettle. Afacility in Calcasieu Parish, La., was developed in such ahurry that its three caverns are too close to each other andto the edge of the salt dome. The first time water is pumpedin to extract oil is also expected to be the last. Thoughofficials say the oil will come out, they predict the wallswill collapse behind it. The Energy Department has beenhoping to move the oil elsewhere but can't until 1992.   In fact, structural integrity is a long-term problem formost of the other SPR caverns. Every time fresh water ispumped in, it will dissolve more of their walls, too. Bycontrast, commercial salt dome facilities that regularly moveoil in and out use brine, which doesn't eat away the saltwalls. But that is expensive and requires huge brine storagecapacity. While not an impediment to the immediate use of theSPR, the fact that most caverns can only be emptied aboutfive times is one reason officials have been reluctant toconduct a sustained test of the system.   SPR employees are often waging war on corrosion. At WeeksIsland, La., the government pressed an old salt mine intoservice instead of carving out a salt dome. Pumps and otherequipment there are deep in the mine, where salt and floodingare threats, rather than above ground. A backup system isplanned for 1991.   At a site in Cameron Parish, La., pipe used to carry offbrine formed as the caverns are created has corroded andruptured. The General Accounting Office of Congress contendsthese failures &quot;may be the forerunners of similar problems atother sites.&quot;   The SPR's Mr. Bartholomew, acknowledging the need toconstantly inspect and repair pipes and pumps, says part ofthe problem was the &quot;mad rush&quot; to store oil in the earlydays. &quot;Pipelines were built and protective measures were madelater,&quot; he says. But corrosion is a common problem in the OilPatch, he says, and &quot;I'm not aware of any corrosion that willprevent a full-scale drawdown of the SPR.&quot;   If the U.S. did draw down the oil, who would get it?Energy Department rules permit anyone -- including tradersand speculators -- to bid for SPR oil so long as they candemonstrate financial responsibility. That would probablymean a certified check, a cashier's check or a letter ofcredit for 5% of the potential contract amount. The buyerisn't even required to refine the oil. Says Cambridge EnergyResearch Associates: &quot;SPR oil might just go from salt domesto steel tanks.&quot;   &quot;There is essentially no restriction on buyers,&quot; agreesMr. Bartholomew. &quot;Our job is to get the oil out.&quot; But hedoubts traders would bid if the SPR were tapped. &quot;They can{buy oil} any day they want to,&quot; he says, and storing oiladds a carrying cost. Any such trader would be &quot;running agreat deal of risk,&quot; he says. If speculation did become aproblem, presumably the Energy Department could halt it bychanging the rules.   Others worry about politicians, not speculators. Underexisting rules, the Energy Department can allocate 10% of SPRoil any way it wants. This could pit one part of the country(and its politicians) against another in a scramble forfavors. &quot;It could be a problem,&quot; says an Energy Departmentspokesman, &quot;given the large number of potential recipientswho all believe in good conscience that they are deserving ofit.&quot;   Bharat Patel, for instance. He is an official of the NewJersey Board of Public Utilities, and he recently traveled toHouston from Newark for a briefing on the SPR. People in theNortheast &quot;are the ones who will suffer the inordinate pricehike&quot; in an oil shortage, he said, asking repeatedly aboutthe 10% special allocation. He finally concluded that &quot;wedon't know how it works and neither do the feds.&quot;   Pumping the oil and selling it aren't the only challenges;scheduling and loading tankers and moving crude through anintertwined pipeline system could prove daunting for oilbuyers. For instance, two oil pipelines initially hooked tothe SPR have since become natural-gas pipelines, making itmore difficult to reach the Midwest and other points north.And there is no good way to get SPR crude from the Gulf Coastto the West Coast except for the Panama Canal. &quot;It's a reallycomplex network of distribution,&quot; says Margaret Felts, aCalifornia energy consultant. &quot;You can only move the oil sofast.&quot;   The 1985 test of the SPR required only two tankers. In anemergency, most transportation experts say, there might notbe enough qualified ships to transfer oil around the U.S.Under a 1920s law called the Jones Act, only U.S.-flaggedvessels can operate from one U.S. port to another. Lastwinter, that kept some badly needed heating oil from gettingto the Northeast from Gulf Coast refineries.   The Energy Department says it has an agreement with theMaritime Administration that oil shippers can obtain waiversof the Jones Act within 48 hours. The key would be the extentof SPR use. At 500,000 barrels a day, &quot;there should be enoughU.S.-flagged ships,&quot; says an Energy Department official. &quot;Atone million it starts to get fuzzy. . . . At three millionthere wouldn't be enough.&quot;   A final question is whether the petroleum reserve, meantto provide energy security, is itself secure. The GAO hasurged greater vigilance against sabotage, citing a 1987 drillin which make-believe terrorists damaged or destroyed SPRpower substations, pipeline valves, an emergency operationscenter and a bridge. The raiders had easily obtainedblueprints, engineering data and diagrams from a localuniversity. Worse, defenders took 53 &quot;casualties&quot; -- 50% fromfriendly fire.   SPR officials won't say what safeguards they're adding inthe current confrontation with a nation known for its ties toterrorism. But their concern with security is evident to awould-be visitor to the Bryan Mound salt domes, who, afternegotiating an unmarked road, is forced to slow to a crawland weave between concrete barriers to get to the gate --only to be turned away by armed guards.   So SPR officials are annoyed by criticism such as theGAO's. In the exercise, the mock terrorists &quot;didn't getbeyond the fence line,&quot; boasts Paul Plaisance, an EnergyDepartment manager in New Orleans. Besides, he complains,&quot;They used mortar attacks against us. That's World War III.I'm not sure the SPR should be able to defend against WorldWar III.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
