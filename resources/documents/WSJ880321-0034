The pact, as expected, incorporates the principles espoused in the general agreement reached by the two sides in 1984.    The plant's 2,000 workers will be paid wages at 85% of Big Three levels in the first year of the contract, and will reach parity by the time the contract expires on March 3, 1991.    Workers will get lump-sum payments equal to 3% of their annual pay for two years of the contract, and will also receive a $750 signing bonus. The contract also provides cost-of-living adjustments.    Mazda, Flat Rock, Mich., also offered a job-guarantee pledge in which no one will be laid off unless there are severe economic conditions, and only then after extreme measures such as salary cuts.    Mazda, which is 25% owned by Ford Motor Co., is the second Japanese-managed company in the U.S. to sign a contract with the UAW. The other is New United Motors Manufacturing Inc., a California joint venture between General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
