Col. William R. Higgins, sources said Thursday.   The Justice Department is trying to determine if a ``case couldbe built for extradition'' of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, who wasseized last week by Israeli commandos at his home in Lebanon, saida U.S. official.   Bringing a case against the Shiite Muslim clergyman involves notonly complicated legal but very sensitive political and diplomaticissues as well.   If the government decided a criminal case could be made againstObeid, the Bush administration would have to decide whether itwould risk the lives of Americans still held hostage in the MiddleEast by taking the Moslem leader into custody for prosecution.   The FBI, meanwhile, is reviewing two statutes that empower thethe arrest, detention and prosecution of terrorists for thekidnapping of Americans overseas and the murder of U.S. citizens inforeign countries, according to a law enforcement source.   The source declined to describe the review as an activeinvestigation, saying the bureau was determining if it hadenforcement jurisdiction.   Officials interviewed about the case spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Asked if the Bush administration was considering extradition ofObeid for possible involvement in Higgins' kidnapping, presidentialspokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``the Justice Department, I amtold, is looking into the case.''   It is unclear if the statements Obeid has made to his Israeliinterrogators so far would provide Justice Department prosecutorswith enough evidence to swear out an arrest warrant.   The statements from the interrogation that have been shared withU.S. authorities do not amount to anything more than possiblyaiding and abetting the kidnapping, one official said.   It is also unclear whether the statements Obeid made to hisIsraeli interrogators would be admissable in an American courtroombecause he was presumably not advised of his right under the U.S.Constitution to remain silent, the official said.   Based on interrogations of Obeid, Israeli authorities say thethree people who kidnapped Higgins in February 1988 were in thesheik's house before the abduction and one of them returned therelater.   The car used to kidnap Higgins was hidden in Obeid's garage,Israeli officials have said.   Israeli officials say Obeid admitted that those who planned the1986 capture of two Israeli soldiers left from Obeid's house tocarry out their mission.   Such evidence may not be enough to charge Obeid withparticipation in the kidnapping.   ``Whether they can make a case is the crucial fact inextradition,'' said another U.S. official, who also spoke oncondition of anonymity. ``To actually use formal extradition, youto to have a charging document, a complaint, indictment,information or something.''   In U.S. federal law, an ``information'' serves the same purposeas an indictment but does not involve a grand jury because eitherthe defendant has waived his right to grand jury consideration ofan indictment or a magistrate has found probable cause to believe acrime has been committed.   A former federal prosecutor familiar with extradition issuessaid the U.S.-Israeli extradition treaty does not contain seriouslegal obstacles to extraditing a terrorist being held by Israel.   But the former prosecutor, who requested anonymity, said thereal obstacle is Israel's willingness to give up Obeid _ if it doesso, terrorists holding Israel citizens will see Israel as``assisting the great devil'' and react with ``no holds barred.''   The statutes being reviewed by the FBI were passed by Congressin recent years in response to terrorist attacks on Americancitizens and officials overseas.   A 1984 statute forbids the taking of Americans as hostages tocompel a foreign government or third party ``to do or or abstainfrom any act'' as a condition of the prisoner's release. The crimeis punishable up to life imprisonment.   The 1986 law, a provision of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security andAnti-Terrorism Act,'' allows federal prosecution of terrorists whomurder U.S. citizens overseas. The murder or conspiracy to murder aU.S. citizen in a foreign country carries a maximum life sentence.   Under federal law, if investigators could prove that Obeidparticipated in Higgins' kidnapping last year, he could beprosecuted for the Marine officer's murder because that killing wasa consequence of his abduction.   But as Fitzwater told reporters at the White House: ``There isno warrant for his arrest, no charges at this time.''   The case ``would have to be reviewed as a legal matter andpursued through normal legal channels.''</TEXT></DOC>
