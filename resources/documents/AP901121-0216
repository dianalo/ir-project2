Delacote, 51, leader of the scientific research team thatcreated La Villette, the French government's new sciece andtechnology museum in Paris, will join the museum in January.   He said he hopes to expand the museum in the Palace of Fine Artsinto a major international center to help foster understanding ofnature and art and appreciation of scientific discovery.   The Exploratorium was founded in 1969 by the late FrankOppenheimer, with whom Delacote formed a close friendship.Oppenheimer's creative exhibit builders designed 50 interactivedisplays at La Villette.   ``Now is a good time for a Frenchman to pay back some of whatFrank Oppenheimer gave to my country,'' Delacote said.   Robert L. White, a Stanford engineer, resigned in December andbecame a member of the Exploratorium's board of trustees.   ---</TEXT><HEAD>Seven Panthers Die, Captive Breeding Pushed</HEAD><DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The deaths of seven endangered Floridapanthers this year have wildlife officials pushing for a captivebreeding program by early next year.   Three of the seven were killed in fights with other panthers,two died of infections and one was killed crossing a road. Onecause of death hasn't been determined.   Two deaths were particularly critical because the cats had``founder'' genetic material, meaning they had some of the purestgenetic material available and haven't been subjected toinbreeding, said Dennis Jordan, Florida panther coordinator for theU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Gainesville.   ``In terms of the goal of the program, to protect existinggenetic material, we've lost some,'' Jordan said.   Under the program, about half the existing Florida pantherswould be captured for breeding programs at zoos and privatepreserves. That, some biologists say, could prevent the extinctionof the cats. No more than 50 panthers are believed to exist, mostof them in southwest Florida.   Biolgists had hoped to begin capturing panthers last spring, butbegan reassessing the program after environmentalists complainedthat wildlife agencies were rushing into the project without properstudies.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Nov. 26</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
