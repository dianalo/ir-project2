Ms. Zucker and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph officials saidboth sides were exchanging offers and counter-offers in thefastest-paced day of negotiating since the talks opened in lateMarch.   ``It is true that we are making progress in some areas butclearly there are still some issues, significant issues, to beresolved,'' said ATandamp;T spokesman Herb Linnen. ``We remain optimisticthat those hurdles can be overcome.''   Union ATandamp;T workers nationwide staged a five-minute work stoppageat 4:15 p.m. EDT Friday in a show of union solidarity.   In the talks, ATandamp;T officials said, the company offered to limitits use of temporary workers, a key union job-security demand.   Still, it would take a major breakthrough to resolve the pay andhealth benefits disputes, and both sides were preparing for apossible strike when the current contracts for about 160,000workers expire at 11:59 p.m. EDT Saturday.   Sources close to the talks said ATandamp;T, which earlier this weekproposed having employees pay more at first for health care,proposed in an informal meeting among top officials from both sidesto revise the offer. Neither side would discuss details. But aunion official said, ``It was a reconfiguration of the existingoffer and it is unacceptable.'' Both sides have characterizedhealth benefits as the issue most likely to prevent settlement.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed with thepublic statements of progress but cautioned that the negotiationswere at a volatile stage and could turn for the worse. In anarrangement likely to be repeated Saturday, formal negotiatingcommittees met at a Washington hotel while the two union presidentsand ATandamp;T's top negotiator held periodic meetings on the majorissues.   Whether the unions _ the CWA and the International Brotherhoodof Electrical Workers _ would immediately call a strike remainedunclear.   If a contract agreement appears at hand at the deadline, theunions likely would agree to negotiate for another day or two. Evenif major barriers remain, union officials have said they might notimmediately strike and instead might try other strategies,including a nationwide labor boycott of ATandamp;T's long-distanceservice.   ``We won't make that call until Saturday,'' Ms. Zucker said.   Both sides have throughout the talks expressed hope a settlementwould be reached before the current contracts expire, but Fridaymarked the first time both sides reported significant progress.   In addition to offering to regulate use of temporary workers,ATandamp;T has amended and expanded its contract proposal to improve eyeand dental care and its parental leave policy. Also, it hasproposed for the first time allowing leave for workers to care forsick relatives.   Those proposals are in addition to the formal offer the companymade Monday, a package which provided varying base wage increasesand lump sum payments depending on job classification and also anew profit-sharing plan for union workers. Also included was aproposal to make employees pay more up front for health care,although current caps on how much a worker might have to spend in ayear would remain in effect. ATandamp;T also proposed a lifetime benefitscap of $1 million.   The unions are seeking expanded medical benefits at noadditional costs to workers and say they have proposed cost-cuttingideas that would meet ATandamp;T's concerns about its rising health carebill, which hit $1 billion last year.</TEXT></DOC>
