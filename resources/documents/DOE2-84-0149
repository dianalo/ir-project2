The assessment of this dose is performedby code CRAC.GAEC, the Greek A.E.C. version of code CRAC2. The collectivedose, which is chosen as a measure of the social radiation risk, is comparedto the dose corresponding to a level of social risk encountered historicallyin energy production as a whole. The outcome of the comparison can bethe determination of one or more sectors of acceptable sites for a setof specific conditions considered, such as the reactor characteristics.The present approach was aimed to deal with the problems stemming fromthe demographic idiomorphy of Greece, where one third of the country'spopulation is concentrated in Athens, with the rest of the country exhibitingsmall population densities. One of the applications of the methodologydeveloped concerned the identification of acceptable sites near Athens.For these sites the risk from the reference severe accident of a standardreactor to the over three millions inhabitants of Athens is less tanthe risk corresponding to the same population that is due to energy production.</TEXT></DOC>
