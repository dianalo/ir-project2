As previously reported in earlier EPRI conferences,Utah Power andamp; Light Company entered into a contract with Phillips Petroleumfor the purchase of geothermal steam and with the intent of buildinga 20 MW plant as the first step toward development of this geothermalfield for electric power generation. The Blundell Geothermal Plant wasrecently completed by Utah Power andamp; Light and has demonstrated promisinginitial results, in spite of particular operating problems encountered.This paper focuses on the initial operating experience of the geothermalplant and indicate the present course of action being taken by Utah Powerandamp; Light principally, as well as Phillips Petroleum, in optimizing plantperformance. 6 figures, 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
