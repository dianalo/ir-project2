Field Jr., chief executive officer of McKesson Corp., dropped out of Stanford University after his sophomore year to work as a grocery-store clerk and &quot;gather up my financial resources,&quot; he says. Just one company transfer and 35 years later, Mr. Field earns salary and bonuses worth more than $1.1 million a year.    But now, some people are questioning the scope of his ambition. Last month, McKesson agreed to pay about $500 million for Alco Health Services Corp., Valley Forge, Pa., in a buy-out that would give McKesson a roughly 38% share of the $20 billion U.S. wholesale-drug distribution market. The Federal Trade Commission has put a hold on the deal, pending review of its antitrust implications.    Similarly, General Computer Corp., Twinsburg, Ohio, recently sued a McKesson unit for allegedly trying to monopolize the market for pharmaceutical claims-processing, which McKesson dominates.    McKesson officials call the FTC delay &quot;routine and expected,&quot; and say General Computer's suit is without merit. Nevertheless, both actions show how the aggressive 54-year-old Mr. Field, expected to be named McKesson's chairman later this month, has remade once-sleepy McKesson into a tightly focused powerhouse.    &quot;McKesson is driven by market share,&quot; says Paul Farrell, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;Their strategy is to enter growth businesses and be the dominant player in those businesses.&quot;    Since coming to McKesson in 1984 after 31 years with American Stores Co. and its predecessor companies, Mr. Field has totally reshaped the company -- and raised its net income by about 40%. Gone are McKesson's conglomerated businesses of a decade ago: its food, liquor and chemical distribution operations and its home-building units that together accounted for nearly 70% of its operating profit in 1978.    In their place, McKesson amassed the market-leading wholesale-drug distribution unit, a 40% share of the nascent pharmaceutical claims-processing business, and dominant positions in retail markets for bottled water and automobile waxes.    &quot;We decided that we didn't want to be in such a broad spectrum of businesses,&quot; explains Mr. Field. &quot;So we focused our efforts on distribution and service-merchandising and marketing.&quot;    The strategy paid off handsomely, industry analysts say. In particular, by concentrating on the drug distribution and claims-processing businesses -- which together earned 64% of McKesson's operating profit in its fiscal 1988 ended March 31 -- the company tapped markets expected to grow sizably as the U.S. population ages. And although more than 70% of McKesson's revenue comes from the relatively low-margin drug and health-care distribution segment, analysts say that staple makes McKesson an excellent bet to prosper even during a recession.    In its fiscal 1988, McKesson had net income of $95 million, or $2.14 a share, up 6% from profit of $89.7 million, or $1.95 a share, the year before. It had 1988 revenue of $7.28 billion, up 9% from its fiscal 1987 revenue of $6.67 billion.    McKesson's market-share strategy is integral to its success, analysts say. That's because the key to efficiencies in both the distribution and claims-processing businesses is technology, especially computers. Paying for the expensive equipment requires cash flow from a large volume of business, which McKesson has obtained through acquisitions. Over time, analysts say, automation has enabled McKesson to lower its costs faster than some less technologically facile competitors.    &quot;You just can't afford the efficiencies at lower volumes,&quot; says Laura Sloate, chairwoman of Sloate, Weisman Murray andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;What they've done makes all the sense in the world.&quot;    But is it legal?    By buying Alco, the third-ranking drug distributor with about 10% of the market, McKesson would dominate the supply channel to independent pharmacists and small drugstore chains in large portions of the East and Southeast, according to John Fay Jr., vice president, corporate affairs, for Bergen Brunswig Corp., the second-ranking drug distributor with about 15% of the market. For this reason, Mr. Fay and some industry analysts suspect the FTC may force McKesson to sell some distribution centers.    But &quot;the 38% {market-share} figure alone is not enough to get the FTC to reject this,&quot; says Mr. Farrell of Goldman Sachs.    In the General Computer case, McKesson's PCS Inc. unit had been working with General Computer to develop a system that would transmit data from drugstores to PCS's central claims-processing facilities, says an executive familiar with the dispute. But General Computer decided it wanted to process claims, too, at which time McKesson ended the relationship.    General Computer later sued PCS in federal court in Akron, Ohio, alleging PCS told customers it would no longer process claims transmitted through General Computer's machines. The suit is pending.    Says Mr. Farrell: &quot;You can definitely see Field's impact on McKesson in terms of the attitude and aggressiveness of its employees. . . . It's not a sit-around, let's-get-a-consensus kind of company.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
