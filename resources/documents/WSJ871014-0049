Treasury bond futures prices, after falling to their lowest level in almost two years Monday, rallied 1 1/4 points, with the contract for December settlement closing at 80 1/2 at the Chicago Board of Trade.    At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the bellwether Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index futures for December settlement rose 4.05 points to 315.65, after a wave of selling in the final minutes of trading knocked the contract off its day's high of 317.    The rallies in the stock-index and bond futures markets gained strength from traders covering short positions -- or buying contracts to offset those sold earlier -- ahead of this morning's release of U.S. merchandise trade deficit figure for August.    However, futures traders and analysts said they were wary of placing any bets on where the stock-index futures market is heading based on one day's rebound.    &quot;The market was oversold on a technical basis, and with the trade numbers coming, why risk staying short?&quot; said Peter Grennan, head of stock-index futures at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. &quot;It's tough to read a fundamental forecast out of what happened today,&quot; Mr. Grennan said.    &quot;I don't know if this is a for real rally or not,&quot; a stock-index futures trader said. &quot;I don't see a lot of people getting in on the long side.&quot;    The consensus among economists is that the August U.S. trade deficit will narrow to about $15 billion from July's record $16.5 billion gap.    A figure of $15 billion or wider &quot;is bearish for the dollar, and therefore for the stock and stock-index futures markets,&quot; said J.R. Fredericks Jr., a futures analyst at E. David Stephens Commodity Corp. in Chicago.    Mr. Fredericks predicted that the stock and stock futures markets won't have a sustained rally until early to mid-1988, when the trade deficit figure and interest rates should have dropped significantly.    In other futures markets yesterday:    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold, silver and platinum futures prices fell in dull trading amid a continued dearth of investment interest in precious metals, analysts and traders said. &quot;It's been listless -- prices continue to trade in a tight range,&quot; said Robert Mizrahi, chief gold trader at Mocatta Metals Inc. in New York. &quot;There seems to be buying on the downside and selling on the upside,&quot; keeping prices in a narrow range, Mr. Mizrahi said. Some traders squared positions ahead of today's U.S. trade report. Several analysts suggested that if the trade deficit for August narrowed to less than $14 billion, the dollar could be buoyed against other currencies, further depressing precious metal prices. Metal traders have been focusing on the performance of the dollar, which firmed slightly against most major currencies yesterday. A lower dollar makes imported goods more expensive and increases inflationary pressure, and many traders hold gold and other precious metals as hedges against inflation. Short-term precious metals prices are likely to remain subdued until real interest rates -- the difference between nominal rates and the rate of inflation -- decline. Nominal interest rates have risen faster than the inflation rate this year, raising the effective real cost of holding gold and other precious metals. &quot;This decreases investment interest,&quot; said Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. Meanwhile, some analysts said several factors are likely to depress platinum prices in the coming years. The market may be &quot;oversupplied&quot; by a production surge, for instance, mainly from South Africa and to a lesser extent North America and elsewhere, said Patrick Retief, chairman of Rustenburg Platinum Holdings Ltd., the world's largest platinum miner.    SUGAR: Initial advances in futures prices couldn't be sustained, and they ended lower. Helping prices were the continued delays in northeastern Europe's sugar beet harvest, which has been hampered by wet weather, with more rain forecast, according to an analyst. For instance, an analyst said, the West German Sugar Industry Association, a producer group, reported that as of last Friday, their country's crop was running behind last year. Harvesting was just 12% complete and totaled 2.8 million metric tons of beets, compared with 17% and 3.9 million tons, respectively, a year earlier. The sugar content of the beets is also lower, the group said, at 15.5%, compared with 17.4%. Meanwhile, expectations that the Soviet Union will buy sugar in the world marketplace continued, analysts said. According to one analyst, the Soviet Union is expected to have a smaller crop because heavy rains hampered its harvest and made the remaining beets vulnerable to early frost. However, the market couldn't hold its advance as selling developed, some of it thought to be hedging by producers, possibly Brazil.    ORANGE JUICE: The correction in futures prices from strong advances late last week continued. Heavy buying Friday was triggered, an analyst said, by the Agriculture Department's smaller-than-expected projection Thursday of an increase in Florida orange production and by rumors that Brazilian processors would raise their export prices. However, the Brazilian increase hasn't yet materialized, analysts said, and prices began their downtrend Monday. Meanwhile, Hurricane Floyd, which swung seaward toward the Bahamas, helped depress prices, an analyst said, not only because its change in course spared most of Florida from possible damage but also because the storm was said to have deposited substantial, beneficial rains in orange-growing areas. </TEXT></DOC>
