In order to obtain furtherquantitative information on the underlying mechanism, the authors usedthe radioligands ({sup 3}H)-prazosin and ({sup 3}H)-yohimbine to performbinding studies on intact cells, with predominantly alpha-1 (isolatedmyocytes) or alpha-2 subtypes (human platelets) of adrenergic receptors.Their studies confirm that both verapamil and quinidine possess a distinctalpha-adrenergic receptor blocking activity and do not discriminate betweenthe alpha-1 and alpha-2 subtype. Their interaction was competitive andin the presence of both drugs inhibition of radioligand binding was additive.The alpha-adrenergic blockade by verapamil was stereospecific as D-verapamilincreased the dissociation constant of the radioligand to a much lesserdegree than L-verapamil. The calcium channel blocker nitrendipine, a1,4-dihydropyridine derivative, did not show any competition up to concentrationsof 10 {mu}mol/l. 26 references, 5 figures, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
