The two other men escaped.   The Irish National Liberation Army, a Marxist offshoot of themainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army, said in a statement tonews organizations that the dead man was one of its guerrillas andwas on ``active service'' at the time.   Active service is a guerrilla euphemism for a shooting orbombing mission.   Belfast police headquarters said the three men converged on thecheckpoint at the village of Clady near Strabane, 65 miles west ofBelfast.   But it made no mention of the gunmen firing and gave fewdetails, except to report that security forces later found a loadedgun and a guerrilla-style ski mask at the scene.   It said the slain man was in his twenties and was from theStrabane area.   Protestant guerrillas earlier Wednesday claimed responsibilityfor the submachine-gun killings of two Catholics in Belfast Monday.   An anonymous telephone caller told the Belfast Telegraphnewspaper that gunmen of the Protestant Action Force shot PeterDolan, 25, and Seamus Morris, 18, to avenge the shooting deaths oftwo Protestant workers by the IRA five days earlier.   The shadowy Protestant Action Force is reportedly linked withthe better known Protestant paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force.   Hundreds of mourners attended Wednesday's funeral for Dolan, abeer deliveryman. Catholic Bishop Cahal Daly appealed for factionson both sides of the sectarian divide to lay down their arms.   ``For the love of Ireland, for the sake particularly of theCatholic community, for the good of the nationalists you claim torepresent, bring an end to this slaughter,'' Daly told mourners.   As in other years, hundreds of Catholic youths rioted Monday andTuesday to mark the 17th anniversary of Britain's now-abandonedpolicy of detaining guerrillas without trial. Police said streetviolence wound down by Wednesday.   In an acceleration of IRA attacks, guerrillas last week killedsix people. One was a soldier killed in a bombing at a barracks innorth London. The other five _ a policeman, two part-time soldiersof the Ulster Defense Regiment and two Protestant civilians workingon a police station _ died in separate attacks in Northern Ireland.   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland andunite it with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of Ireland undersocialist rule. Protestants form a majority in Northern Ireland.   The death of the guerrilla slain Wednesday night brings theoverall toll since sectarian and political violence flared inNorthern Ireland in August 1969 to at least 2,673.</TEXT></DOC>
