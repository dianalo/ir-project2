A year earlier, the companies earned $1.2 million, or 14 cents a share. Revenue rose 11% to $15.9 million from $14.4 million.    The $14.2 million write-down, taken by Santa Anita Operating Co., is equal to its total investment in Minnesota Racetrack Inc., which operates Canterbury Downs racetrack in Shakopee, Minn. The loss also includes a $2 million reserve to operate the racetrack during the 1988 season and a $1.2 million loss from 1987 first-half operations. The company uses equity accounting for its 18.5% stake in Minnesota Racetrack.    Santa Anita Operating, which also operates the Santa Anita Park horse-racing facility, and Santa Anita Realty Enterprises Inc., are two separate companies that report results on a combined basis. Their shares trade as a single unit on the New York Stock Exchange. Santa Anita Realty Enterprises, a real estate investment trust, owns Santa Anita Park.    Santa Anita shares closed Friday at $29.875, unchanged. The second-quarter results were released Saturday.    The companies said that Santa Anita Operating's results won't adversely affect the operations or dividend policy of the real estate investment trust.    Robert P. Strub, president of Santa Anita Operating, said in a statement that attendance at the Canterbury Downs racetrack fell from a year earlier.    The company attributed the decline to bad publicity surrounding its unsuccessful effort to obtain a reduction in the state of Minnesota's share in the track's parimutuel wagering.    For the six months, Santa Anita Cos. posted a loss of $9.6 million, compared with profit of $7.9 million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 8.2% to $75.8 million from $70 million. </TEXT></DOC>
