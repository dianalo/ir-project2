DMG is a data storageand retrieval software system that provides the user interface to ATFraw and analyzed data. Data are described in terms of data models anddata types and are organized as signals into files, which are internallydocumented. The system was designed with user accessibility, softwaremaintainability, and extensibility as primary goals. Extensibility featuresinclude compatibility with ATF as it moves from pulsed to steady-stateoperation and capability for use of the DMG system with experiments otherthan ATF. DMG is implemented as a run-time library of routines availableas a shareable image. General-purpose and specialized data acquisitionand analysis applications have been developed using the DMG system. Thispaper describes the DMG system and the interfaces to it. 4 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
