The measure won committee approval, 11-3, and now goes to theSenate floor.   The House last week approved a similar bill that also wouldprovide a three-year stay of deportations of Chinese in the UnitedStates after fleeing the crackdown this summer against studentdemocracy demonstrations.   That measure was sent to a subcommittee for further study.   The bill approved by the full panel contains no provision forstaying deportations of Chinese.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., sponsor of the bill, said it wasneeded to provide safe haven for citizens of the two CentralAmerican nations who have not gained refugee status and to enablethem to work in this country.   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who had been fighting the measure formore than two months, relented on Thursday but said he remained anopponent.   He said the murder rate in El Salvador was lower than in theDistrict of Columbia and added that the real aim was to enable thealiens to get jobs. He said this would undermine the nation'sexisting immigration laws.</TEXT></DOC>
