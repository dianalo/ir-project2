Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House BankingCommittee, said such a Mexican transaction, completed in January,is just one of a number of ``back-door financing schemes'' puttogether ``behind closed doors'' to fund Treasury's internationaloperations.   ``Mexico's important. ... I come from a Mexican background, butI never felt that we had to give the family jewels in order toprove that we're good neighbors,'' Gonzalez told David C. Mulford,under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, at ahearing.   ``We do not believe in producing subsidies for foreigngovernments,'' Mulford replied. ``The entire debt strategy is anindication that our efforts have been devoted to curing thisproblem without recourse to taxpayers money.''   The Mexican deal was the first and most important struck underthe so-called Brady plan. Named after Treasury Secretary NicholasF. Brady, it seeks to force banks to forgive part of the crushing$1.3 trillion debt burden on Third World countries in exchange foreconomic reforms in the nations that will make it possible for themto pay their remaining debts.   At issue is whether the United States gave Mexico a favorableprice when it sold $2.99 billion in zero-coupon Treasury bonds.Mexico used the bonds as collateral to guarantee repayment of itsremaining debt after commercial banks agreed to accept some losseson the debt.   Mulford maintained that Mexican purchase of the bonds in effectsaved U.S. taxpayers more than $100 million compared with what theUnited States would have had to spend to raise the money in thestandard way _ selling interest-paying bonds through financialmarkets.   However, the General Accounting Office, Congress auditing arm,disputed that. It said the zero-coupon bonds sold to Mexico are theequivalent of a derivative bond product known as STRIPS, which,like a zero-coupon bond, pays no interest.   Both zero-coupon bonds and STRIPS are sold at a deep discountfrom the face value. The bondholder reaps a profit by receiving thefull face value at maturity, 30 years later.   The price of the bonds sold to Mexico should have been set inrelation to the price of STRIPS, which generally is somewhat lowerthan the price of similar interest-bearing bonds, the GAO said.   However, ''Treasury set a price for the bonds that involved aneffective subsidy of approximately $192 million,'' said Allan I.Mendelowitz, the GAO's director of international finance issues.   Gonzalez said the larger issue was the law which gives theTreasury secretary power to make such decisions withoutcongressional authorization. He said it amounts to a circumventionof the congressional appropriations process.   However, Mulford said Treasury would continue to consider usingzero-coupon bonds as it thought proper as part of Third World debtreduction deals. He said such bonds likely would be used as part ofa deal in process between banks and Venezuela.   Gonzalez was the only member of his 51-member panel to attendthe hearing. Congress is in recess for its summer vacation.</TEXT></DOC>
