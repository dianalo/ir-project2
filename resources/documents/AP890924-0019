He said at a news conference that bloodshed is inevitable afterthe Vietnamese forces backing his government are gone, but that thelevel of fighting depends on foreign aid to the insurgents.   Officials on both sides of the conflict have predicted newoffensives by the guerrillas after this week's withdrawal ofVietnamese troops.   Hun Sen also said that his troops still control Pailin, agem-mining region near the Thai border reported under intenseattack by the Khmer Rouge, the strongest group in the three-memberguerrilla coalition.   Defense Minister Tea Banh acknowledged Saturday that the KhmerRouge now control some territory near Pailin.   Vietnam, which invaded in 1978 to end a bloody reign of terrorby the Khmer Rouge and installed a pro-Hanoi government, haspledged it will remove all its forces from the country by Tuesday.The guerrillas say it is a ploy and that Vietnam is hiding soldiersin Cambodia.   A large farewell ceremony for the Vietnamese military,reportedly the last of 26,000 in Cambodia, is to be held Monday inPhnom Penh.   ``After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops the war willcontinue,'' Hun Sen told reporters. ``As to the scope of the war,we think it will depend on foreign countries.''   Thailand has allowed the insurgents to set up camps in itsterritory, while China has armed them.   ``We appeal to those who supported the enemy on the basis oftheir opposition to Vietnamese forces in Cambodia to reassess theirpolicies,'' said Hun Sen. ``The best way to prevent civil war is toimmediately stop supplying arms.''   He said he is willing to improve ties between his Communistgovernment and the United States through joint searches for remainsof U.S. servicemen missing since the Vietnam War.   Both Vietnam and Laos have participated in some searches formissing U.S. servicemen together with American specialists.   Hun Sen said his government already has discovered some remainsand is willing to hand them over. He did not say how many bodieshave been discovered, and a senior Foreign Ministry official saidhe did not know the number.   ``It was the U.S. that showed a lack of interest in our finds,''said Hun Sen. ``They said they have no relations with the PhnomPenh government so they will not get in touch with the Phnom Penhgovernment on this issue.''   China and many Western countries refuse to establish diplomaticties with an administration installed by Hanoi, and the UnitedNations recognizes the guerrilla coalition as Cambodia's officialgovernment.   However, a Foreign Ministry official said Sunday that Chineseofficials came to Cambodia for the first time since 1979 earlierthis year to discuss resuming trade ties.   Hun Sen confirmed that he and guerrilla leaders have agreed toresume peace talks some time in the future.   Peace talks in Paris failed in July after Hun Sen rejectedguerrilla demands that the Khmer Rouge be included in atransitional government.   Under Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge forced hundreds of thousands ofCambodians to leave the cities and killed thousands in a brutalattempt to create a primitive agrarian society.   The Phnom Penh leader again refused to share power with them.   ``We can make some concessions, but with regard to the KhmerRouge we cannot make any concessions at all,'' he said.   Meanwhile, 11 Western aid agencies in Cambodia called ongovernments Sunday to prevent the Khmer Rouge returning to power.   ``Our experience in Cambodia and our contact with Cambodians atall levels of society confirm that what Cambodians most fear is areturn to the horrors of the Khmer Rouge regime,'' the groups saidin a statement.   They criticized some countries for insisting that the CommunistKhmer Rouge be part of a future coalition government. Many Westernand non-Communist Southeast Asian countries who wish for Vietnam'sdownfall back the coalition despite the inclusion of the KhmerRouge. The two non-Communist guerrilla groups do not hide theirdistaste for the Khmer Rouge, but say they would rather share powerthan fight them.</TEXT></DOC>
