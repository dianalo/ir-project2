In United Nations-sponsored negotiations in Geneva, the UnitedStates is seeking the right to emit about 20 percent more nitrogenoxides than it now does, said Sheldon Meyers, EPA's actingassociate administrator for international programs.   Meyers said the United States wants credit for earlierunilateral efforts to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. A 1979treaty calls for reductions in cross-border flows of air pollution``taking into account the efforts already made.''   The United States refused to seek such a credit in another treatlast fall aimed at safeguarding the earth's protective ozone layer.   The 20 percent increase in nitrogen oxide emissions would becompensation for the efforts and achievements of the existing U.S.control program, which has reduced ground-level concentrations ofnitrogen oxides by 14 percent since 1975 and emissions by 8.5percent since 1978, Meyers said.   Nitrogen oxide, an important component of auto emissions, laterturns into nitric acid in the atmosphere, and along with sulfuricacid from sulfur dioxide emissions creates the acid rain whichenvironmentalists blame for the death of aquatic life in sensitivelakes and streams.   ``There's no question that absent our control program, we wouldhave much higher nitrogen oxide emissions,'' and the United Statesbelieves other countries should catch up before it undertakes newcommitments, Meyers said.   Earlier negotiations resulted in international agreement in 1985to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 30 percent, an agreement theUnited States has declined to join.   Both sulfur and nitrogen oxides are emitted by coal-burningpower plants and factory boilers. In the eastern United States andCanada, sulfur accounts for two-thirds of the excess acidity inrainfall and has been believed more damaging to lakes and streams.   Half of Canada's acid rain originates in the United States, andCanada for years has pressed for additional U.S. action against theprecursors of acid rain.   Due to auto emission standards imposed in the United States in1975, a new car today emits only one-fourth the nitrogen oxides ofcars made before that. Canada adopted U.S. auto emission standardsin 1985, and most European countries are only beginning tocontemplate such controls.   But U.S. emissions are expected to increase again around 1995because of more travel by more cars. Thus, Meyers said, ``There'sno way we can agree'' to a Canadian proposal to accept the U.S.position permitting higher emissions in exchange for a commitmentnot to increase cross-border flow of nitrogen oxides.   In fact, said Meyers, the United States does not believe suchflows can be measured. Canada, he said, ``uses a (computer) modelwe say is not accurate. It's very simplistic.''   During talks leading up to the September international treatycalling for a 50 percent reduction in emissions ofchlorofluorocarbon compounds that attack the ozone layer, U.S.negotiators declined to seek credit for emissions reductionsresulting from the 1978 U.S. ban on use of these chemicals asaerosol propellants.   The CFC negotiations were not comparable, Meyers said: The 1978aerosol reductions ``were minor. These (nitrogen oxide reductions)are not minor.''   Canada also has sought a treaty with the United States limitingU.S. sulfur dioxide ``exports'' to 2.2 million tons, compared withabout 4 million tons today. The United States has not agreed.   According to EPA estimates, the United States emitted 21.3million tons of nitrogen oxides in 1986 and 23.3 million tons in1978, the peak year. Canadian emissions were 9 percent of the U.S.total in 1980. EPA expects U.S. emissions in the year 2000 to beabove 22 million tons.   Meyers' revelation drew this criticism from Rep. James Florio,D-N.J., a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committeeconsidering, for the fifth straight year, various measures againstacid rain:   ``For too long the administration has talked about research whenit was clear that what was needed was action. Now they are talkingabout increasing by 4 million tons a year the amount of nitrogenoxide that is released into the air. It simply does not makesense.''</TEXT></DOC>
