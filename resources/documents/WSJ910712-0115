Stocks edged higher all afternoon to lift the Nasdaqcomposite index to 488.37, a gain of 1.20 points, or 0.3%.Advancing stocks finished with an edge on decliners, 946 to867.</LP><TEXT>   Investors seemed to shrug off several possible influences:June retail store sales seemed weaker than expected; initialreports of second-quarter bank earnings were below someexpectations, and the bond market mustered a 1/2-point rallyfor the 30-year Treasury bond.   Traders said investors were tight-fisted with their cash,perhaps reluctant to take positions before most companiesreport second-quarter results later this month.   &quot;You're in a market that rewards the good ones but tearsapart the bad ones,&quot; said Robert McIntyre, senior vicepresident for trading at Principal/Eppler, Guerin andamp; Turner.   For instance, Society Corp. said earnings improved in thequarter and investors promptly bid the stock higher. TheCleveland bank holding company said earnings rose to $1.29 ashare from $1.20 in the 1990 quarter. Society rose 2 3/4 to43 3/4.   On the other hand, analysts expressed some disappointmentwith Caere results. The software concern said second-quarterearnings improved to 32 cents a share from 27 cents a yearago. But some analysts saw signs growth may not be as rapidas hoped. Caere stumbled 2 1/2 to 17 1/2 in active trading.   National Market System volume eased to a lazy 108.9million shares from Wednesday's 138.5 million.   OTC gains were mostly consistent with the Big Board. TheNew York Stock Exchange Composite Index inched 0.67 point, or0.3%, higher to 206.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Averageclosed at 2959.75, a gain of 14.98 points.   Analysts who follow the stock markets may not agree onwhat exactly is holding investors back. There is moreagreement, however, on a perception that a certain amount ofbearishness underlies the market.   Edwin Powell, a portfolio manager at Provident CapitalManagement, said that perception has investors hesitatingeven when they believe the fundamental case is for risingstock prices.   Mr. Powell said economic growth, even if slow, and aflat-to-down interest rate trend will push stock priceshigher in coming months. He contends the relatively lowervaluation of smaller stocks makes those issues that much moreattractive.   In their current hesitant mode, investors paid the mostattention yesterday to ADT Ltd., trading more than 5.1million shares of the security services concern.   ADT tried to assuage concerns about its prospects bysaying its core businesses were &quot;profitable and trading up toexpectations.&quot; But it also conceded that improvements inoperating performance aren't expected to offset the downwardtrend from nonoperating results. ADT shares slipped 1/2 pointto 9.   Weaker-than-expected retail sales reports for June yieldedmixed results among OTC retailers.   ClothesTime added 1/4 to 6. Dollar General climbed 7/8 to16 1/2. Filene's Basement was off 3/4 to 23 3/4 and CharmingShoppes was unchanged at 22 1/2.   Westmark International dropped 3 1/2 to 39 1/2. Dow JonesProfessional Investor Report said Westmark told analysts thata difficult transition for some ultrasound diagnostic imagingsystems products will make the second quarter a tough one.   Datascope gained 2 7/8 to 63 3/4. Yesterday's &quot;Heard OnThe Street&quot; column in this newspaper said many investors likethe prospects for a new Datascope product to seal thepunctures that result when catheters are inserted. Otherinvestors warned that high costs and imminent pricecompetition might make this the time to take profits inDatascope stock.   Centocor lost 1 3/8 to 35 7/8. Centocor halted sales ofits cancer blood tests when the Food and Drug Administrationindicated it was &quot;no longer comfortable&quot; with such sales.Those tests had been approved for investigation and researchpurposes. Centocor plans to continue supplying the tests inCanada, Europe and Japan.   Immunomedics rose 3/8 to 7 3/8. The Warren, N.J., maker ofdevices to diagnose and treat cancer announced an agreementfor developing and licensing cancer imaging products withAdria Labs, a unit of Montedison S.p.A.
