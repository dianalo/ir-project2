Major development of N.W.T. oil reserveswould make a substantial contribution to Canada's energy security, strengthenCanadian sovereignty in the Arctic, and provide economic benefits toall regions of Canada. The Amauligak field in the Beaufort Sea is capableof producing 27,500 cubic metres (175,000 barrels) per day of high qualitylight crude oil. Development of this structure would enable reservesfrom smaller fields in the region to be developed and would provide theimpetus for further exploration. Government financial support for specificmajor energy projects is justified to achieve energy security and selfsufficency.</TEXT></DOC>
