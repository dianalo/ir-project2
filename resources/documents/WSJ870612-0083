The No. 2 U.S. auto maker, which owns 25% of Mazda, will hold 74% of the 59 million New Zealand dollars ($34.8 million) of shares in the new company, Vehicle Assemblers New Zealand Ltd. Mazda will hold remaining 26% of the venture.    While the transaction is tiny by auto-industry standards, it marks yet another move by Ford to establish cooperative efforts with other auto makers around the world. Last fall, Ford combined its operations in Argentina and Brazil with Volkswagen AG of West Germany to form Autolatina, a joint venture. And just last month, Ford announced it was exploring with Nissan Motor Co. the possible joint development and production of a new vehicle -- which sources say is a front-wheel drive van -- in North America.    A Ford spokesman said Vehicles Assemblers will have two plants in Auckland, and will have more manufacturing capacity than any other auto maker located in New Zealand.    The spokesman said Ford and Mazda began negotiating the merger last September, when the companies decided they wanted &quot;to streamline their manufacturing operations.&quot;    The new project is the latest cooperative effort between Ford and Mazda. Ford will buy 40% to 60% of the cars Mazda will start building this fall at a plant in Flat Rock, Mich. Ford is scheduled to start getting cars from the plant in the first quarter of 1988.    Also, Mazda is helping to design, engineer and manufacture the Festiva minicar. It is being built for Ford by Kia Motors Co. of South Korea, in which Ford holds a 10% stake. The Festiva has already entered the West Coast market, and a spokesman said it should be distributed nationwide by the end of this year. </TEXT></DOC>
