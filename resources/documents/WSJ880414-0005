The forecast was contained in remarks for delivery by Chairman Thomas F. Frist Jr. before an analysts' group in New York. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Hospital Corp.'s stock jumped $2.25 to close at $36.    The company didn't say whether profit exceeded the year-earlier $80.1 million. Because of a decline in shares outstanding, to 71 million from 82.2 million, per-share earnings could rise even on a profit decline at the restructured company.    The company said it expects to report that first-quarter sales exceeded $1 billion, down from $1.3 billion a year earlier because the company now operates fewer hospitals. Although the 1987 figure won't be restated, the company said sales would have been $885 million if 104 hospitals sold last year were excluded.    First-quarter figures are expected to be released Monday, a spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
