Rudy Perpich of Minnesota toured his state in a twin-engine airplane last week, promoting a new and sweeping plan for overhauling the state's tax system.    &quot;Passage of the federal tax-reform act has provided a window of opportunity that we must not close,&quot; the Democratic governor said. Key state legislators were quick to applaud the outlines of the tax plan, and by the end of the week, many were predicting legislation would be enacted by summer. &quot;We've got a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here,&quot; says Gerry Nelson, the governor's communications director.    Minnesota isn't alone. Prompted by last year's overhaul of the federal tax system, dozens of other states are being forced to consider radical revisions of their own tax codes. But unlike the federal tax-overhaul effort, which left the distribution of the tax burden among income groups largely unchanged, the state efforts will probably place more of the tax burden on those at the top of the income scale.    &quot;The fight is far from over,&quot; says Robert McIntyre, director of federal tax policy for Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed group. &quot;But my impression is that states are moving toward making their tax systems more progressive.&quot;    The majority of state income tax systems are closely linked to the federal tax system, and in most cases, the new tax law would cause state tax revenues to rise considerably. That is prompting hot debates in state capitals across the country over how much of that revenue windfall should be returned to taxpayers, and in what form.    Currently, state taxes are notably unprogressive. Many states rely heavily on sales taxes to raise revenue, placing an inordinate burden on the poor, who spend nearly all their income. And a combination of relatively flat tax rates and ample tax breaks at the state level enables high-income taxpayers to pay relatively little in taxes.    A recent study by Mr. McIntyre's group, for instance, found that in 15 states the richest taxpayers -- those with incomes of more than $500,000 a year -- paid an average tax rate that's less than half that paid by the poorest 20%. &quot;If you thought the old federal tax system was bad,&quot; says Bruce Fisher, research director at Citizens for Tax Justice, &quot;take a look at what's going on in the states.&quot;    During the past decade, many states have moved away from progressive taxation, hoping that lower rates on high-income executives would help lure new businesses. &quot;The heydey for progressive state taxes was in the 1960s,&quot; explains Steven Gold, director of fiscal studies for the National Conference of State Legislatures. &quot;Since then, progressivity hasn't been a big topic in the states. Instead, they've been concerned about tax competition&quot; with other states.    This year, however, that trend seems likely to be reversed as a result of the pressures put on states by the tax bill President Reagan signed last year.    About 30 states have broad-based income taxes that are based on the measures of adjusted gross income or taxable income used in the federal tax form. Last year's tax-overhaul bill wiped out many federal tax breaks, thus raising both measures of income for most upper-income Americans.    At the federal level, the elimination of tax breaks for the wealthy was offset by a sharp reduction in the top tax rate, to 28% from 50%. At the state level, however, such a sharp rate reduction is unlikely to occur, for two reasons. First, many states have flatter rate structures to begin with, and therefore can't afford such steep reductions at the top. And second, some states want to use the revenue &quot;windfall&quot; that results from closing tax breaks to finance their budgets, rather than to lower rates. As a result, taxes for the affluent are likely to rise.    Business groups and supply-side tax cutters are disturbed by the trend. &quot;They're making a mistake,&quot; says Jeff Bell, an adviser to Republican presidential hopeful Rep. Jack Kemp of New York. &quot;Governors and state legislators don't understand how dynamic these tax effects are.&quot; The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sent out material to its state and local affiliates, urging them to lobby for lower top tax rates and retention of tax breaks for capital-gains income.    Such efforts, however, are going against a powerful tide. Ohio's new tax plan illustrates the point. Signed into law last November, it cuts tax rates for the average Ohioan 8%, and provides an especially generous 14% rate cut for those at the top of the income scale, according to Ohio Tax Commissioner Joanne Limbach. Nevertheless, wealthy residents of Ohio will pay more taxes under the new law because they lose lucrative write-offs for tax shelters and capital gains.    Gov. Perpich's plan would have a similar result. He wants to use his state's revenue windfall to pay for dropping the top rate to 8% from 14%. Nevertheless, high-income Minnesotans would, on average, face bigger tax bills. They'd lose not only the tax breaks eliminated under the new federal law, but also the state deduction for federal income taxes. &quot;The plan would make the income tax much more progressive,&quot; says Wayne Cox, coordinator of the Minnesota branch of Citizens for Tax Justice.    To be sure, some state officials and lobbyists are still struggling to keep new tax laws from increasing the tax bite on the affluent. In Wisconsin and Connecticut, for instance, business groups are launching major campaigns to retain the tax benefit for capital-gains income, which mainly benefits the wealthy. And in Iowa, Republican Gov. Terry Branstad has proposed to cut the top individual tax rate more than half, to 6% from 13%. That would result in a big tax cut for upper-income Iowans, even though they already face a far lower tax burden than the poor and middle-income residents of the state, according to Mr. McIntyre's study.    But Democratic legislators are balking at Gov. Branstad's plan, and Charles Bruner, chairman of state senate's tax committee, says a top rate of 9% may be more pleasing to the legislature. &quot;I'm optimistic&quot; that the final tax bill will improve the tax system's progressiveness, says Mark Smith, secretary-treasurer of the Iowa AFL-CIO.    Minnesota tax officials believe that while their plan will increase the tax bite on the wealthy, it will also make the state look like a more attractive site to new businesses. That's because most published comparisons of state tax systems simply look at tax rates, not at tax breaks. By dropping its top rate to 8% from 14%, says one state official, Minnesota will fall from fifth place on the list of high tax states to 20th. </TEXT></DOC>
