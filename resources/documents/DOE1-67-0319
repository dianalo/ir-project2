<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-67-0319 </DOCNO><TEXT>The dipole electromagnetic radiation of a beam in the synchrotron passingthrough the rapid azimuthally nonuniform magnetic field is studied. Thespectral density of the radiation is shown to be greater for the particlesmoving nearer to the magnetic system poles. The nature of a such growthof the spectral-angular density of radiation is found to be independentof the certain type of the plane magnetic system (short magnets, dipolemagnet edge, plane ondulator). The formula for spectral-angular raiationdensity versus particles transverse coordinate is obtained. Some featuresof the beam transverse profile diagnostics by means of beam radiationin ondulator fields and short magnets are analysed. 25 refs.; 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
