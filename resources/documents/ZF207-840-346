 Theyhate them because they're written in weird languages, that pretend they'rewritten in logic and won't let you write loops.andP;  Programmers also hate expertsystems because they allow into a computer department lots of people whoshouldn't be there.andP;  Real AI researchers hate expert systems.andP;  They hate thembecause they're old hat, technologically; they don't feel serious now thatsales people are on the trail, and they feel thwarted that all the excitingnew areas like neural nets and HCI get left out.andP;  Real DP people hate expertsystems as well; hyped, run on funny machines that aren't Big and Blue, nouse to me here, and so on.andM;So why bother with such a maligned approach as expert systems?andP;  (I won't callthem knowledge based systems, as that lets them off the hook too easily).andO;The major thing that happened to expert systems is, as we all know, the GreatHype of 1983.andP;  This was the unfortunate year that Ed Feigenbaum of StanfordUniversity published his tract on the Fifth Generation Project announced bythe Japanese.andP;  Feigenbaum is one of those very typically Americanresearchers/entrepreneurs, and he realised that the Japanese were about toget one over on the US of A by using expert systems to create 'a new wealthof nations' -- knowledge itself.andM;You know the rest.andP;  Suddenly we had the Alvey Programme.andP;  Expert systems inthe UK, which had been killed off by the Lighthill report in 1973, took offin a big way.andP;  The defence of national pride and the economy justified a lotof people learning Lisp and Prolog all of a sudden, and then the businesspeople started telling all their clients that this was the way of the future.andO;Enter a frantic period of hype, over which we'll draw a veil of tearfulregret.andM;Benefits to ComeandM;Now that the dust has settled, what's the realistic assessment of expertsystems?andP;  How should those potential supporters we began with really think?andO;Expert systems are an offshoot of AI research.andP;  AI has itself a controversialnature in the IT community, but expert systems are the most public andsuccessful face of it.andM;The most basic idea underpinning expert systems is that some problems arehard.andP;  That's it, the key.andP;  Some problems are non-polynomial and can't besolved by pure algorithmic approaches alone; the search space is too large.andO;But we can solve them and do.andP;  People seem to do so by mixing algorithm andheuristic and searching for solutions, and accept the first one, notnecessarily the most efficient.andM;The AI industry began building loads of programs in the late 50s to playchess, since this is a hard problem that seems an intelligent activity, andthat would teach us about the mind in general.andP;  What it ended up with was aload of programs that only play chess; they were limited to that domain.andO;Nothing really changed for a decade or so until US researchers, mostly aroundthe aforementioned University of Stanford, accepted this limitation andstarted writing programs that could 'only play chess', as it were, but inareas of a little more practical use, like medical diagnosis and mineralprospecting.andM;By the late seventies and early eighties, the generic expert system was nowbecoming definable.andP;  What you needed in the abstract were three components: aknowledge base, inference engine and user interface.andM;A knowledge base contains knowledge or expertise, in the form of rules --typically production rules of the form IF condition THEN action.andP;  Thisseparates knowledge of a complex sort from the embedded sort usually found inthe control structure of a program.andP;  Every program in a conventional languageis also, if you like, an expert system.andP;  A calendar program, that's capableof telling you on which day Easter falls in 1993, contains knowledge.andP;  A realexpert system's knowledge base is explicit and readable, whereas thecalendar's is not.andP;  Most importantly, the knowledge base in an expert systemcan be modified and/or extended.andM;Inference EnginesandM;An inference engine contains the problem solving mechanism of the program.andO;There are many ways of searching a knowledge base, and many of these wereexplained by Nick Hampshire in .EXE in November 1988.andP;  The most simple isprobably a depth-first search forward chaining one.andP;  Depth-first means thatthe search space of solutions is seen as a tree.andP;  The program traverses itfrom left to right and, at every parent node, dives down to its children tosee if the solution is reached.andP;  If not, it goes back up, along to the nextsibling parent and repeats the process.andP;  This method is guaranteed to find asolution if one exists but is not the most optimal.andP;  A breadth-first searchis similar, only the program proceeds laterally from sibling to sibling --finding the best solution if one exists.andP;  Typically, depth-first is easier toimplement and less computationally intensive.andM;Forward chaining means that the system takes data and chains forward to reacha solution.andP;  Usually this means responding to a query, prompting the user fordata if necessary and firing rules on the available data to reach aconclusion.andP;  The opposite is backward chaining from goal state to possiblecause.andP;  Think of it as 'what' as opposed to 'why'.andM;Other more complicated methods abound.andP;  Take a blackboard architecture, namedafter a program called Hearsay-III.andP;  The blackboard has a scheduler whichmanages the various knowledge sources which compete with each other to handleeach bit of incoming data, and ranks the surety with which each source dealswith the data (ie one source says it is this sure this is the case, anotherless or more so).andP;  It then places these findings on an agenda which it usesto arrive at a best-guess solution by combining the weights of the responses.andM;User InterfaceandM;The third component of an expert system is the user interface.andP;  At the veryleast, on a dumb terminal with teletype green screen input, there must be away a non-programmer expert can interact with the system.andP;  Probably the mostvital element is the ability to query any explanations the user receives fromthe system.andP;  Originally, this facility existed because the techies wouldn'tbelieve the answers the systems came up with unless they could see how thesolution was arrived at.andP;  The simplest is a trace of rules fired, which hascanned text attached; the text is shown chronologically, linked by syntaxsugar of some sort.andP;  A typical explanation might say something like: 'I havedecided that the current month is November because the trees are bare andbecause the nights are long and because the shops are selling treedecorations and because the BBC is trailing The Wizard of Oz'.andM;Creating Expert SystemsandM;There's no reason why an expert system can't be created using any programminglanguage under the sun.andP;  One or two of the early ones were written in COBOLand FORTRAN, though many of these are written or translated at least into C.andO;But if you start with one of these languages instead of one of the logicprogramming languages, just start a bit earlier.andP;  LISP and PROLOG are theeasiest to work in because so much has been done already for you.andM;LISP (Lots of Irritating Spurious Parentheses) is one of the earliestprogramming languages, developed at MIT by John McCarthy in 1959.andP;  It's basedon the lambda calculus, in case you cared, but what you do need to care aboutis that Common Lisp, a standard, is finally emerging.andP;  PROLOG is younger(Alain Colmerauer, Marseilles University 1971) and quite a bit different toany other programming language.andP;  It's based on FOPC (First Order PredicateCalculus) and is much more declarative than LISP.andP;  It's harder to learn,incidentally, if it's not your first ever programming language and you haveto learn to think in a new manner.andP;  Stick to LISP if you can; LISP is morepopular in the US, there's more software and LISP-based tools, and I thinkit's more flexible.andP;  But don't take my word for it.andP;  Also worth mentioning isPOP-11 which reads like Pascal and comes from Sussex University.andP;  It's notthat widespread yet but there's an implementation on the Mac that might helpit a bit.andM;The chances are that these specialist languages are used on either aspecialised LISP machine (especially in the States) or on a PC.andP;  Symbolicsare the best known LISP machine makers; they've brought down the price fromabout 100K pound sterling in 1987 to the current level of 20K pound sterling,but they remain very expensive single user workstations, powerful though theymight be.andP;  LISP machines have a bad reputation in so far as they seem tooffer the Management a poor number of MIPS per pound, but they can be superbto develop and prototype on.andM;PCs can run either systems you write yourself in some implementation of LISPor PROLOG or whatever, or a specialised shell.andP;  The IBM PC and the rest havebeen used mainly (due to their ubiquity) either for applications in PROLOG 2(from Expert Systems International in Oxford, which in my experience is themost common PROLOG on that platform) or to run systems developed on a largermachine.andM;For instance, Logica Cambridge developed a system kernel for productformulation with Shell under Alvey on a Symbolics.andP;  It was originallydeveloped in a toolkit (see below) called Knowledge Craft, then rewritten inCommon Lisp, then ported to a PC which had a Hummingboard installed.andM;The Mac is beginning to feature as well.andP;  Symbolics has developed a LISP chipcalled the Ivory which can be bolted on to a Mac and turn it into effectivelya baby Symbolics (same operating system, editor etc.andP;  and memory).andP;  BBN'sEdinburgh site delivered an operational expert system for the National DrugsIntelligence Unit at Scotland Yard last month on a Mac IIx with 4 MB ofmemory and a colour screen, written in Common Lisp.andM;In the same way that expert systems tend to get written (or at leastprototyped) in LISP or PROLOG, a lot more tend to be developed usingspecialised shells or toolkits.andP;  The obvious comparison is with 3GLs and4GLs.andP;  The first expert system 4GLs were the first expert system programsthemselves, which simply had their knowledge bases amputated.andP;  The idea wasthat the inference engine was now proved sound and that a new applicationdomain could be seamlessly inserted.andP;  Fifteen years on, the idea is stillgoing strong in the lower end of the market with PC shells for smallishapplications.andP;  But they all to some extent suffer the same faults that MYCINhad when it became EMYCIN; it's a limiting solution.andP;  You are held to apredefined shell and are constrained by it.andM;The other attack was toolkits.andP;  The approach here is that a programmer needswhat is effectively a superset of the language to write an expert system in,which give him/her 'tools' to build it.andM;The most well known here are ART (Advanced Reasoning Tool), Knowledge Craftand KEE (Knowledge Engineering Environment).andP;  These will provide a rulelanguage to build knowledge bases in, and a choice of inference mechanisms,as well as graphics, windows and utilities to build the user interface in.andO;All run on Suns now, but are usually criticised as being slow and a bitunwieldy.andM;Xerox Dandelion and Daybreak workstations also run the now venerable LOOPS(LISP Object Oriented Programming System) which, it is interesting to note,has never become a supported product.andP;  When I worked on a project using themwe wrote our own toolkit which borrowed some of the ideas but was just aboutefficient enough to stop you punching your screen through twice a day.andM;It's worth noting, by the way, that the LISP community is not best pleasedthat the recent interest in object oriented programming techniques hasignored it.andP;  People turning to C++ straight from C are missing out on all thetrail blazing that the LISP people did in the seventies and early eightieswith things like LOOPS and Flavours.andM;Shells, in any case, are where it's at as far as the 'conventional' ITcommunity feels.andP;  PC shells include Crystal from Intelligent Environments, XiPlus from ExperTech, Leonardo from Creative Logic and Nexpert from theeponymous Nexpert.andP;  (Interestingly, Nexpert is a French company that had tomove to Palo Alto to get noticed and has now moved back again.)andM;Gary Flood is a computer journalist.andP;  He began as an unemployable artsgraduate with ingrained techno fear, who retrained in AI and worked forLogica before the miseries of recursion drove him away.andP;  There are a coupleof public domain expert system programs around that can run on PCs.andP;  The mostwell known is probably ESIE, the Expert System Inference Engine.andP;  Manybulletin boards and PD software libraries carry this program.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
