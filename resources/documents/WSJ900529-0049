Cahners, the U.S. subsidiary of London-based ReedInternational PLC, said Sail will join its Marine PublishingGroup, which includes Power andamp; Motoryacht, MotorBoat, andMotoryacht International.</LP><TEXT>   Sail was an odd fit for Des Moines, Iowa-based Meredith,which publishes service-oriented magazines such as BetterHomes and Gardens, Ladies' Home Journal, Country Home, andMetropolitan Home. Sail had a paid circulation of 163,000 inDecember 1989, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.   But the sailing magazine may mesh well with Cahners'sother publications. &quot;We have had pure power (boat) books, andnow we are adding a pure sail book,&quot; Neal Vitale, a Cahnersvice president, said, adding that the company will look forother acquisitions in the boating field.   Sail competes in a growing field of power boat and sailingmagazines owned by Diamandis Communications Inc., New YorkTimes Co. Magazine Group, and Times Mirror Co. Recently,Times Mirror Magazines acquired two marine magazines, TheYacht and Tournament Digest, which covers the salt-waterfishing tournament circuit.   Cahners's mainstay still is business magazines, with 65titles. But with acquisitions such as American Baby andModern Bride, Cahners now has 11 consumer titles.</TEXT></DOC>
