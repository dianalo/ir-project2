The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported thatnet income at the refining divisions of 10 major oilcompanies fell more than 60% from the preceding heatingseason. Independent refiners' profits dropped 51% from thepreceding winter.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They lost their shirts,&quot; said Helmet Merklein, head ofthe agency, in an interview.   After the frostiest temperatures in 60 years hit the EastCoast late last year, heating oil bills in the Northeastspiked up 55% in December, compared with a year earlier. Butprices began dropping after the December cold snap, andJanuary was relatively warm. Overall, the average U.S.household paid $71 more for home fuel oil during the heatingseason between October 1989 and February 1990, the reportfound.   Despite price boosts in heating oil and propane, &quot;this didnot translate into a remarkable season for U.S. refineries,&quot;the report concluded. For the last quarter of 1989 and firstquarter of 1990, which covers the heating season, refinershad lower profit margins than major U.S. manufacturers onaverage, it said.   The study also didn't find any evidence ofanti-competitive behavior among refiners or marketers eagerto cash in on cold temperatures, as some consumer advocatesand lawmakers had feared, Mr. Merklein said.   The study was based on financial information filed bycompanies this spring with the Securities and ExchangeCommission. It examined returns from refining divisions at 10major integrated oil companies, which account for 51% of U.S.refining capacity, and from six independent refiners to gaina representative view of what was happening in the industryduring the past heating season.   Refiners and wholesalers which were lucky enough to havelarge stocks of heating oil on hand when the cold weather hitin December presumably enjoyed greater financial returns thanif there had been no cold snap, the study conceded. Butoverall, over the October-to-February heating season, higherprices were more than offset by greater costs and a priceplunge in February.</TEXT></DOC>
