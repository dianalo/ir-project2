But theydo see eye to eye on one thing: Salaries of corporateexecutives are just too high.   The vice president has warned that corporate boards shouldcurtail &quot;some of these exorbitant salaries paid to corporateexecutives {that are} unrelated to productivity.&quot; And theArkansas governor would go a step further to &quot;end thepractice of allowing companies to take unlimited taxdeductions for excessive executive pay.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Fueled by the backlash from President Bush's trip toJapan, executive compensation may be a hot political issuethis year. The nation's chief executives, never the mostpopular group with U.S. voters, clearly have a problem ontheir hands.   &quot;As a political issue, it's dynamite,&quot; says Republicanpolitical theoretician Kevin Phillips. Adds Democraticpollster Geoffrey Garin: &quot;The whole question clearly strikesa raw nerve.&quot;   Executive pay has already become a staple of the campaigntrail in New Hampshire, site of the first presidentialprimary. &quot;How can we run a country with a president who'scoddling people he ought to be kicking in the fanny?&quot; asksGov. Clinton, who proposes allowing companies to deductbonuses or severance payments only if those payments arelinked to profits and are offered to employees in addition totop executives. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska calls it&quot;unacceptable&quot; for corporate executives to make millions ofdollars while their companies are posting losses. And formerSen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts argues that excessive payis hurting America's ability to compete in the internationalmarketplace.   Nor is the threat to chief-executive pay merelyrhetorical: Legislation is gaining steam on Capitol Hill. Thetoughest proposal, by Democratic Rep. Martin Sabo ofMinnesota, would prevent companies from taking a taxdeduction for the portion of any executive's compensationthat is more than 25 times the amount paid to the lowest-paidworker in the company. A more modest proposal by DemocraticSen. Carl Levin of Michigan would allow shareholders to voteon proposals that would alter a corporation's executive-paypolicies.   Business groups angrily assert that the politicians arejust trying to score demagogic points at the executives'expense. &quot;Congress can yell and scream about things, but theydo not have a proper role in setting standards,&quot; says JerryJasinowski, president of the National Association ofManufacturers. &quot;They don't have the authority.&quot; But lawmakersare moving ahead anyway, with hearings on the variousproposals expected late this month and early next.   Most of the proposals being discussed wouldn't limit howmuch companies could pay their executives -- but wouldrestrict how much they could deduct on their tax returns.Currently, corporations can deduct as a cost of doingbusiness whatever they pay their executives. So, for acompany paying the 34% top corporate tax rate, a $1 millionsalary costs it only $660,000 -- with the taxpayers payingthe rest. If half of the $1 million salary were no longerdeductible, the actual cost to the company would rise to$830,000.   Even advocates of curtailing compensation acknowledge thecomplexities of the issue. For example, would all highsalaries be affected? Would the Chicago Bulls basketball teambe unable to deduct the astronomical compensation ofsuperstar Michael Jordan? And would highly successfulcorporations be subject to the same limits as falteringcompanies?   &quot;The challenge is how to cure the problem without creatinga bigger problem,&quot; says Sen. Levin.   Concern over the perceived excesses of executive pay inthe U.S. have been mounting for some time; a number ofstudies have found little correlation between pay and jobperformance. In one recent report, Graef Crystal, acompensation expert, criticized the compensation of TimeWarner Inc.'s co-chiefs, Steven Ross and N.J. Nicholas, whobetween them garnered what the study estimated at almost $100million in 1990. (A Time Warner spokeswoman refutes theestimate, asserting that it includes stock options that mayor may not be exercised. She places Mr. Ross's compensationat $3.3 million in 1990 and Mr. Nicholas's at $2.4 million.)   But for all the studies, it took Mr. Bush's trip tocrystallize the issue. The combined annual compensation ofthe dozen chief executives who accompanied the president onhis trade mission was $25 million in 1990, or an average ofmore than $2 million each. Those paychecks stood in starkcontrast to the laggardly performance of some of thecompanies represented, particularly U.S. auto makers.   The resulting furor could wound not only the executives,but also their host, President Bush. Unlike Mr. Quayle, thepresident has so far brushed aside the issue. Although he hassaid mildly that &quot;boards of directors should be looking verycarefully at these matters,&quot; the president has refused tospeak out against high compensation for executives. He alsofirmly opposes legislation on the issue. &quot;I don't think thefederal government has a role in all of this,&quot; he said at arecent news conference.   Bush loyalists say the issue is minor compared with thelarger question of the economy's overall health. &quot;It's like apiccolo in a symphony orchestra,&quot; says GOP politicalconsultant Eddie Mahe. &quot;You can hear it over the symphonysometimes, and sometimes it gets a little solo, but it is notgoing to carry the symphony.&quot; But even Mr. Mahe concedes thatthe issue may add to Mr. Bush's image of being an elitist, aswell as stoking the anti-establishment sentiment that isbrewing in the countryside.   &quot;It's part of the whole populist package that's workingits way out there,&quot; Mr. Mahe says. In addition, he says, theissue &quot;provides a cheap-shot opportunity in the politicalprocess&quot; -- especially for Democrats.   The Democrats aren't wasting the opportunity. Thepresident's position &quot;underscores the Achilles' heel ofGeorge Bush's administration,&quot; contends Democratic Rep.Dennis Eckart of Ohio. &quot;He is protecting privilege andshowing a callous lack of concern for the working man.&quot;   Patrick Buchanan, the conservative commentator who ischallenging Mr. Bush in the Republican primaries, also isweighing in. &quot;You can't have executives running around making$4 million while their workers are being laid off,&quot; Mr.Buchanan said in a recent cable-television interview in NewHampshire.   On this subject, at least, Democrats seem perfectly happyto share their ammunition with Mr. Buchanan. &quot;It's an issuethat everybody ought to talk about,&quot; says House MajorityLeader Richard Gephardt of Missouri. &quot;We need to deliver amessage on this.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
