<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-1125 </DOCNO><TEXT>The observed dramatic onset of large deformations in the highly neutron-richZr and Mo isotopes is examined by carrying out self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubovcalculations employing pairing-plus-quadrupole-quadrupole effective interactionsoperating in a reasonably large valence space outside an inert core.It turns out that the observed deformation systematics can be understoodin terms of the polarization of the (2d/sub 5/2/){sup 6} part of theN = 56 core initiated by the involvement of the 1h/sub 11/2/ orbit inthe underlying valence space. A variational calculation of the high-spinyrast spectra in the highly neutron-rich Mo isotopes suggests stronglythe possibility of observing the backbending effect. It is also shownthat the B(E2) values associated with the yrast spectra can provide unambiguoussignatures of the large structural changes that are likely to occur inthe high-spin yrast spectra of the nuclei in this new island of deformation.</TEXT></DOC>
