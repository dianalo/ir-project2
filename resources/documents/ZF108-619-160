Dongarra, University of Tennesseecomputer scientist and Communications Editorial Panelist.andP;  Measuring floatingpoint operations per second, the Hitachi supercomputer peaked at 107 millionFLOPS, while the single-processor Cray hit 90 million FLOPS.andP;  (However,Cray's eight-processor machine is still the leader in fastest multiprocessorrates.)andM;SALT TO THE WOUND...andP;  An engineering professor at Duke University says theU.S.andP;  lags behind Japan in fuzzy logic technology--a computer design concepthe believes has tremendous economic value.andP;  Paul P. Wang is a fuzzy proponentwho says Americans are forfeiting the benefits of this technology by notrecognizing its potential commerical uses.andP;  The Japanese, on the other hand,have already found numerous applications for the computer logic which allowsprogrammers to interpret imprecise data.andM;IN HINDSIGHT...andP;  In a candid interview with Reuters news service, the CEO ofDigital Equipment Corporation admitted that his company missed out on severalgreat opportunities in this computer age, the most painful of which was thebirth of the personal computer.andP;  &quot;I don't think anybody, including us,expected the personal computer to be as revolutionary,&quot; said Ken Olsen, whosecomputer-making company is second only to IBM.andM;SO LONG, SOCRATES...andP;  The Bush Administration's decision to phase out ProjectSocrates is stirring up the Defense Department.andP;  The Socrates system wascreated during the Reagan years to track advancements in key foreigntechnologies and to help the government make defense-funding decisions basedon evaluations stored from a network of technical experts.andP;  Former projectdirector Michael Sekora resigned from the DoD when the Socrates budget wascut in half.andP;  He has opened a consulting firm in Florida and now intends toexpand on the Socrates design he helped develop.andM;STRATEGY PLAN...andP;  The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) is conducting astudy to determine what the government can do to maintain the U.S.andP;  lead inthe software market.andP;  The OTA is exploring the technological changes andtrends in software and computer technologies that Congress must confront inadapting our current system of intellectual property protection to meet thedemands of the future.andP;  The study, which began in May, is entitled &quot;Stayingon Top: The Challenges of Technological Change and Global Competition inProtecting Intellectual Property.&quot;andP;  The agency expects to deliver itsfindings to the Technology Assessment Board by October 1991, and publishthose results by February 1992.andM;THE DANDY DOZEN...andP;  The U.S.andP;  Commerce Department has identified the 12&quot;emerging technologies&quot; that will create markets for an estimated $1 trillionby the year 2000.andP;  They are: advanced materials, superconductors, advancedsemiconductor devices, digital imaging technology, high-density data storage,high-performance computing, optoelectronics, artificial intelligence,flexible computer-integrated manufacturing, sensor technology, biotechnology,and medical devices and diagnostics.andP;  Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbachersaid the nation will benefit from these markets, but only if &quot;Americanbusiness shakes out some cobwebs and takes some decisive actions.&quot;andM;POPS EYED...andP;  A contract to provide the U.S.andP;  Navy with a Primary OceanicPrediction System (POPS) has been awarded to Grumman Corporation.andP;  POPS is asupercomputer-based system that will be used to model the ocean andatmosphere to predict their behavior.andP;  The 11-year contract is valued at over$200 million.andM;SCHOOL DATA...andP;  A computer database in Westerfield, Ohio is helping parentsaround the country choose schools for their children.andP;  Designed for familieswho have relocated or changed districts, the SchoolMatch database containsinformation on 15,889 public school systems and 8,000 private schools.andP;  Itsservice also compares school districts in 22 categories including how moneyis spent, the class size and test scores.andP;  Subscribers can obtain a printoutof all schools in a specific area for $97.50.andP;  A report on a single schooldistrict costs $49.andM;ENOUGH, FOR NOW...andP;  Jim Manzi, chairman of Lotus Development Corp., hasdeclared his firm is through seeking possible acquisitions.andP;  He announcedthis decision shortly after the 11th-hour collapse of Lotus' attempt to mergewith Novell, Inc. last May.andP;  &quot;We don't think we need to do any acquisitionsto be successful,&quot; he said.andP;  Products are the focus; the next one out will bethe Microsoft Windows-compatible Release 3.1.andM;ROBOT ON A ROLL...andP;  The daily lunch crowds packing the take-out sushi counterat Manhattan's Ashford Shoppe are served by a chef who is two feet tall, hasa metal claw and never chats with the customers.andP;  The Suzumo STSushi-Wrapping Sushi Robot mixes and rolls the rice and various raw fish onits short conveyor, then wraps each piece individually in clear cellophane.andO;General Manager Sara Vanni, who checks the fish for freshness every day, saysSushi Robot turns out 1,200 pieces per hour, six times faster than a humanchef.andP;  The results of a recent taste test by a group of neighborhood Japaneserestaurateurs seem to indicate the machine-made sushi is delicious, but therobot's $65,000 price tag is indigestible.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
