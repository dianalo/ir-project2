(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Meridian Bancorp Inc. plans to boost itsloan-loss reserves by $75 million and shed its credit card andtitle insurance businesses amid signs of a weakening economy.   The bank holding company said the moves would allow it to focuson and expand its core banking businesses.   Meridian said it expects to announce next month a net loss of$35 million to $39 million for the quarter ending Sunday, or about86 cents to 96 cents per share. During last year's third quarter,Meridian made $22.5 million, or 56 cents a share.   Most of the loss would stem from the addition to loan-lossreserves and a charge of $15 million to $17.5 million related tothe sale of the title operations, Meridian said.   ``We expect to return to normal levels of profitability in thefourth quarter, to be profitable for all of 1990 and to continuethe payment of dividends at current levels,'' said Samuel A.McCullough, chairman and chief executive officer.   Meridian said it had re-evaluated its loan portfolios inresponse to the weakening economy in general and the real estatesector in particular.   The reserve for possible loan losses will be increased to about$165 million, or about 2 percent of loans outstanding.   Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. will arrange the sale of the titleoperations, which had losses of $7.3 million for the six monthsending June 30.   The company decided to sell its $300 million portfolio of creditcard receivables because of high overhead, potential legislativerestraints and the need for costly technology, McCullough said.   Meridian also said it would convert $300 million of indirectautomobile loan receivables to marketable securities to improve itscapital ratios and reduce reliance on external funding.</TEXT></DOC>
