They said Petroleum Development Oman drillers next week willattempt to establish a well on the summit of the 1,300-foot JebelMadmar near the oasis town of Adam, ancestral home of the AlBu-Said tribe from which Sultan Qaboos, ruler of Oman, is descended.   One of the largest undrilled prospects left in Oman, JebelMadmar is described by Muscat-based geologists as a classichydrocarbon-trapping anticline and a promising discovery.   Thesiger, the first European to penetrate the Oman desert andlive with its nomadic tribesmen, wrote about Jebel Madmar and theneighbouring Jebel Salakh in his book ``Arabian Sands.'' Hedescribed the mountains as dome-shaped formations ``regretfully''associated with hydrocarbons by geologists.   It took 50 years to follow up on his observation because theprospect was virtually inaccessible and required modern roadconstruction technology, said the sources, who spoke on conditionthey not be named.   The cost of building the access road to the drilling locationhas not been disclosed but was equivalent to the cost of drillingan ordinary well, they said.   Until now, Petroleum Development Oman has been concentrating ontargets beneath the desert thaet offer easier access for seismiccrews and rigs.   A state-financed natural gas exploration program was launched inOman five years ago in a bid to save fuel oil.   Reserves were estimated at 7 trillion cubic meters at thebeginning of 1988, the latest year for which figures are available.   About $15 million was being invested in gas development projectsthis year, according to a government spokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
