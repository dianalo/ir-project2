About 10% of the buying agents polled in a monthly survey said they expect business at their companies to decline moderately because of the Oct. 19 rout. But more than half said it's too early to estimate the impact of the crash, 31% expect no change and 6% think their business will increase.    Production and new orders posted their 11th consecutive monthly increase in November, but the growth rate slowed, according to the monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management. Inventories declined for the second consecutive month, &quot;probably as a result of slowing deliveries and shortages in metals, plastics and paper products,&quot; the survey said.    The survey's composite index fell to 58.9% in November from October's 61.8%. A figure above 50% indicates that the economy is generally expanding. November marks the 16th consecutive month of expansion.    Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the purchaser group's business survey panel and director of materials management for Pitney Bowes Inc., noted that October's index level was the highest since December 1983. He added that if the year's average monthly level -- 57.3% -- continued next month, this would be consistent with 4% inflation-adjusted growth in the gross national product for 1987.    The survey is compiled from data provided by more than 250 purchasing managers. It looks at various economic measures and asks whether each category was stronger or weaker than in the previous month.    The continuing increase in new orders suggests that December production will be healthy, the survey said. Production expanded in November, as the group had expected, because of October's increase in new orders. Although production growth slowed, output was termed still strong, given the usual seasonal slowing.    For the 14th consecutive month, more purchasers reported slower rather than faster deliveries, &quot;a reflection of the robust economy,&quot; the purchasing group said.    More buying agents reported price increases than declines for November. The percentages -- 57% reporting higher prices, 1% reporting lower -- were unchanged from October, however, suggesting that growth in price rises may be reaching a plateau, the survey said. Price climbs again were confined mainly to paper and metal-related and plastic-related products.    November's rate of employment growth slowed from the pace of the prior three months, the agents said, but the rate is still strong given seasonal slowing.    Lead times expanded in November for production materials and for maintenance and operating supplies. They shortened slightly, after two months of expansion, for capital expenditures, the survey said. </TEXT></DOC>
