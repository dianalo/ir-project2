Maurice Mann, chairman of the Pacific exchange, and representatives of the Financial Center Task Force said they agreed that a Honolulu stock exchange would be a &quot;worthwhile and constructive undertaking.&quot; They said they will hire an independent consultant to develop a business plan for a trading operation that would operate as a unit of the Pacific exchange, which has an equities trading floor in Los Angeles and equities and options trading in San Francisco. The plan is expected to be completed in the fall.    An exchange spokesman said a Honolulu exchange would, among other things, facilitate trading after the New York Stock Exchange has closed. The Pacific exchange already operates 30 minutes after the New York floor closes. The spokesman said trading during that half-hour ranges from 250,000 to 600,000 shares. Honolulu's time zone is six hours behind New York's.    A spokesman for the task force said Honolulu's location also would be attractive to Pacific Rim business interests who trade in American stocks. </TEXT></DOC>
