First Mutual was the eighth bank seized this year inMassachusetts, which alone accounts for 15% of all bankfailures nationwide, and the 16th bank to be seized in NewEngland in 1991, according to the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp.</LP><TEXT>   The failure is considered a blow to the option of keepingbanks operating with a combination of private investment andfederal capital-so-called &quot;open bank&quot; assistance.Negotiations broke down this spring between the FDIC, whichpublicly endorses the idea, and several investor groups,leaving the bank to fail. Similar proposals to assistinsolvent banks in New Hampshire have also recently beenabandoned.   Bank of Boston will pay $10.1 million for $1.1 billion ofdeposits, and the right to purchase $250 million in cash andother securities and $426 million in selected residentialmortgages and consumer loans. Last week, Bank of Bostonsuspended its quarterly dividend for the first time since theDepression to gain favor with regulators and preserve capitalfor regional acquisitions.   &quot;Yes, we omitted the dividend, and today we purchased a $1billion bank,&quot; said Bank of Boston Senior Vice President IraJackson. &quot;Strategically, this bank is a perfect fit for us.&quot;   Along with boosting its retail deposits by 9% to $13billion, the purchase will allow Bank of Boston, which has$31 billion in total assets, to increase its market share inthe lucrative suburbs ringing Boston -- once a First Mutualstronghold.   To insure all deposits up to $100,000, the FDIC willeventually have to pay about $400 million, a sum it will thenattempt to reduce by selling off the failed bank's badassets, mostly foreclosed properties. A private Massachusettsinsurer -- Mutual Savings Central Fund Inc. -- will providecoverage for $46.2 million in accounts that exceed the FDIC'slimit.   While First Mutual's concentration of construction andcommercial real estate loans was higher than that of almostany other bank in New England, its sound deposits and loyalcustomer base attracted several investor groups over the pastyear.   &quot;Here's another example where acceptable terms just couldnot be reached&quot; between investors and regulators, said oneFDIC official. &quot;The idea of open bank assistance is still onewe're interested in, but it's just not happening.&quot;   In its last quarterly report -- for the first quarter --First Mutual lost $14.9 million, had negative shareholderequity of $57.7 million and carried $234 million innonperforming assets, or about 31% of total loans of $766million. Regulators generally consider banks withnonperforming assets amounting to more than 10% of totalloans to be troubled and in need of close regulatorysupervision.</TEXT></DOC>
