While Houston lost jobs in the past year and Dallas barely held its own, the chronically depressed cities along the Rio Grande have been adding jobs at a healthy clip. Figures just released by the Texas Employment Commission highlight an unusual situation: double-digit unemployment in communities along the Mexican border coexisting with rapid employment growth.    Take McAllen, in the heart of the Rio Grande Valley and the center of Texas's citrus-growing region. McAllen had 21% unemployment in January, the highest of any metropolitan area in the U.S. Yet employment in the McAllen area grew 4% in the 12 months ending in January. That's a yearlong job-creation rate unsurpassed by San Antonio, Fort Worth, Austin, and any other major Texas community.    Three other border cities accustomed to hard times have been adding jobs at a pace well above the state average. El Paso's employment rose 3% in the year ending in January. In Laredo and Brownsville-Harlingen, job growth was 2%. For Texas as a whole, employment was essentially flat in the same period. All three of these border communities had unemployment rates in two figures.    Observers suggest several reasons for the border employment boomlet. Citrus orchards destroyed by the killer freeze of 1983 are beginning to produce once again. The population of &quot;winter Texans,&quot; Midwesterners who flee to south Texas to escape the cold, is also on the rise, and with it, service-industry jobs catering to the visitors.    In El Paso, defense dollars pumped into the Army's Fort Bliss and nearby White Sands Missile Range have bolstered job growth.    But the big factor in border employment appears to be the rapid expansion of the &quot;maquila&quot; industry. This so-called twin-plant system permits non-Mexican companies to set up assembly plants in Mexico and manufacture there for immediate export to the U.S. and elsewhere.    Although the bulk of the job growth has been in Mexico's northern tier, the roughly 900 maquila factories have attracted a sizable infrastructure of suppliers and transport companies on the U.S. side of the border. &quot;Most people in the North think these jobs are only in Mexico. That's just not the case,&quot; says Tommy Joyner, president of the McAllen Chamber of Commerce.    ---   CALIFORNIANS APPEAR LESS BUOYANT about the future. The annual &quot;economic well-being&quot; survey by San Francisco-based Field Institute found only 24% of those polled saying they expected California's economy to improve in the next 12 months. That's the smallest share in the seven years the question has been asked.    Although 51% said the state was enjoying good times, the percentage of respondents who said they were better off financially than last year, and who predicted they'd be in even better shape next year, was down from recent years. About one-quarter of respondents said it was a bad time to make a major purchase, roughly twice as many as thought that way a year ago.    ---   IT'S THE EFFORT THAT COUNTS. New Jersey, facing horrendous toxic-waste problems, gets top marks from an environmental group for its toxic-waste and solid-waste cleanup programs. California, where smog is a perennial problem, rates highest among the states in air-pollution reduction. &quot;Some states with the worst problems have the best programs,&quot; says the Washington, D.C.-based Fund for Renewable Energy and the Environment.    The group gives Wisconsin the nod for overall environmental effort among states. The lowest environmental scores go to Wyoming, West Virginia and Mississippi.    ---   THE BOSTON GLOBE PUSHES NORTH in a major way next month when it adds a New Hampshire supplement to its Sunday edition. The 16-to-20-page section will allow New Hampshire advertisers to buy space in the Sunday Globe at reduced rates. The Globe's new section is a further challenge to New Hampshire's largest paper, Manchester's legendary Union Leader, whose roughly 20,000 circulation lead over the Sunday Globe has been shrinking.    ---   WHAT A PARTY! Parades, costumes, food, drink and assorted hoopla surrounding Mardi Gras generated $239 million in spending in Greater New Orleans last year, says University of New Orleans economist James McLain. More than three-fourths of the money came from tourists taking part in the pre-Lenten carnival. Among Prof. McLain's documented spending: $192,000 for plastic beads and trinkets tossed from parade floats to street revelers. (By contrast, Pasadena, Calif., officials say they reaped $1.6 million in added consumer spending from last January's Super Bowl.)    ---   THE BEST-SELLING CAR MODELS in the Far West and Rocky Mountain states in 1986 were the Honda Accord, Honda Civic, and Nissan Sentra, says auto industry data specialist R.L. Polk andamp; Co. of Detroit. For the U.S. as a whole, Ford's Escort was No. 1.    ---   BRIEFS: With some 150 technology-based companies in the area, Columbus, Ohio, claims to be the third-largest repository of computer-based data in the world, trailing only Washington, D.C., and Moscow. . . . Neighbors North Dakota and Manitoba form a joint commission to look at water, trade and other cross-border issues. </TEXT></DOC>
