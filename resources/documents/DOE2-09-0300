<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-09-0300 </DOCNO><TEXT>The essential physics involved in the reaction-rate-theory analysis ofradiation effects at temperatures where both vacancies and self interstitialsare mobile is contained in the expressions used for the strengths ofdistributed point-defect sinks such as dislocations, cavities, and grainboundaries. These sink strengths have been obtained by various authorsin distinctly different ways, thus giving rise to some possible confusionin comparing the various results. This is even more true with respectto the effect of interaction fields on these sink strengths, and theso-called bias factors or sink efficiencies have been defined in entirelydifferent ways, thus rendering quantitative comparisons difficult. Theauthors present here a comparison of several procedures in the literatureand attempt to make reasonable quantitative comparisons.</TEXT></DOC>
