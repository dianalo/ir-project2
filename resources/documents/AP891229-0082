He was 71.   Short, who served as chief from 1964 to 1973, evoked the ire ofcivil rights leaders in the late 1960s for his handling of racialdisturbances, but supporters said his tough stance in the face ofrioting prevented Houston from faring far worse.   He once was mentioned as a potential running mate for 1968conservative presidential candidate George Wallace.   Short resigned on the eve of the inauguration of former MayorFred Hofheinz, who planned to fire the chief the moment he tookoffice.   ``We were essentially an all-white police department underHerman that believed in heavy-handed tactics'' that included theuse of illegal wiretaps, Hofheinz said Thursday.   Wiretapping indictments were returned against officers who hadserved under Short, but he was never charged with wrongdoing.   ``Certainly we made mistakes as does everyone, but I never ruledin any way except in accordance with the rules,'' Short said fiveyears after his retirement.   Short died of cardiac arrest Thursday at Methodist Hospital,where he had been listed in serious to critical condition since hewas admitted Dec. 6, said hospital spokeswoman Brenda Cook.   Survivors include his wife, Maxine; a son, Robert Short ofHouston; and two stepdaughters, Leslie Adams of Bastrop, Texas, andCharlotte Bivins of Greenbrier, W.Va. Services are scheduled forSaturday at Niday South Park Funeral Home in Pearland, Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
