After he and other governors met with President Reagan, Dukakistalked with reporters on the White House lawn and was told thatmembers of the press corps tell each other to ``vote yourvacation'' in any presidential contest.   ``Got to top Santa Barbara,'' taunted one correspondent, notingthe lush California resort town near the ranch where Reagan hasoften vacationed.   ``How about Cape Cod _ what do you think?'' asked theMassachusetts governor.   Mild murmurs of approval and a query about winter vacationsgreeted his suggestion.   ``The Berkshires,'' Dukakis replied firmly, only to be met bysilence from the dozens gathered about him.

John Tower says.   Tower added that televised presidential debates are no betterthan ``East Texas hog-calling contests.''   The current system is a ``very, very imperfect way to select anational candidate,'' Tower said in comments Sunday at a conventionof the National Utility Contractors Association.   In the past, he said, ``The smoke-filled room screened out thecandidates who were least competent.''   Tower, a Republican, said today's system can result in a nomineewho has the best commercials and who articulates his ideas best,but who may not be the best president.   He also criticized the news media, saying, ``I don't think themass media are capable. You don't get a balanced assessment fromsensational press stories. The mass media have become too strong.On the whole, the media are consumed with an arrogance of power.''</TEXT><BYLINE>___</BYLINE><HEAD>Moral Majority President Sees Fallout from Swaggart Admission</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The president of Moral Majority said Mondaythat television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart's problems will likelyhave a negative impact on the Republican presidential campaign offormer television preacher Pat Robertson.   Jerry C. Nims, president of the conservative lobbying group,said Swaggart's tearful confession and his stepping down from hisown TV ministry Sunday will not affect Robertson's core ofsupporters.   However, the Swaggart controversy might change the minds ofsupporters who had been leaning toward the Republican hopeful.   ``He (Robertson) has a large base of support'' that wouldn't beaffected by the fall of a televangelist, Nims told a newsconference called by a group of conservative organizations onanother subject. ``But it might have an impact outside,'' he said.   The Moral Majority president said Robertson's core of followersremains strong, but he may ``well lose some of the fringe''supporters.   Nims noted that the minsters who have fallen in the past year,including Jim Bakker _ are members of the charismatic group, whichdiffers from Moral Majority and Robertson followers.   ``For much of our constituency, it does not have an impact,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
