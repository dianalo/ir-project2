RIGSBY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Deposed PTL founder Jim Bakker says hisproposal to buy and revive PTL's Christian theme park andtelevision ministry is the best, but PTL's bankruptcy trustee saysan Australian is the leading candidate.   ``This is 100 percent payout of all debts to all creditors,''Bakker said of his plan Thursday. ``I don't know of a better dealover the table or under the table.''   Bakker said at a brief news conference outside his office thatan overseas financial group is willing to lend him the money heneeds to regain control of the ministry. He said the lendersinsisted they not be identified publicly.   Bakker said he gave details of his takeover plan to trustee M.C.``Red'' Benton on Thursday and said he was allowing Benton 48 hoursto consider it before releasing it to the public.   But while Benton had previously said he was open to any plan tosave PTL and that Bakker was welcome to submit a plan, he saidWednesday that he changed his position this week because Bakker'spresence threatened to deprive the ministry of all donations.   ``With Mr. Bakker sort of confusing the issue at this time withhis appearances, people have said they won't give while he's here.I know the Bring Bakkers Back (group) won't support us. I can'tafford to risk losing the people we do have supporting us,'' Bentonsaid.   ``He will not have a part in this ministry as long as I'mtrustee.'   Benton said Gavin Morehu, described as a millionaire Christianinvolved in the import-export business in Australia, has offered topay $200 million for the PTL complex just south of Charlotte, N.C.   Morehu ``has until July 15 to come up with an initial deposit ofan earnest $50 million. Then we'll work out a contract. If hedoesn't make the deposit, he's out,'' Benton said.   The ministry has been in financial straits since Bakker left inMarch 1987 after revelations he had a sexual tryst with a churchsecretary, Jessica Hahn, then paid her to keep quiet about it.   Revelations of Jim and Tammy Bakker's luxurious lifestylefollowed, the ministry foundered as donations dwindled, and theministry filed for bankruptcy court reorganization with $130million in debt.   Benton said Bakker needs to work out many of his own financialand personal problems before he could return to PTL, includingtroubles with the Internal Revenue Service, his failure toreconcile with the Assemblies of God church and several lawsuits,including one with PTL.   Bakker and his financial dealings at PTL also are the object ofa federal grand jury investigation in Charlotte, according topublished reports.   Bakker said he would provide a financial statement from Dun andamp;Bradstreet showing his lender is worth $2.3 billion.   The latest reorganization plan calls for much of PTL's assets tobe sold and for a new, debt-free, non-profit ministry to be formedwith the leased use of the PTL complex's studios and church.   Benton said he is continuing to discuss the possible sale withpotential buyers and hopes to recommend a buyer to U.S. BankruptcyJudge Rufus Reynolds in Columbia by Aug. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
