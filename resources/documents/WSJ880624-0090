The headquarters site is a city-owned parcel that the big investment bank will lease for 99 years. Drexel said it will pay 10% of the appraised value of the land for the first 15-year period, with a 40% increase in the 16th year.    The lease payments will also be adjusted in the 30th year and every 10 years thereafter to reflect the reappraised value of the site, Drexel said.    The company hasn't selected an architect or a developer yet.    Drexel said it has also taken an exclusive option on a site in the borough of Queens, on which it could build an administrative facility of up to 400,000 square feet. In return for commitments to develop and occupy the two sites, Drexel said, the Manhattan headquarters will benefit from a 75% tax exemption in the first year, declining 7.5% a year for 10 years.    The headquarters building will also include a day care center for the children of Drexel employees, the first of its kind on Wall Street, the company said.    In December 1986, Drexel, citing changes in the new tax laws and the Ivan F. Boesky insider-trading scandal, called off its planned move to a new headquarters at Seven World Trade Center. </TEXT></DOC>
