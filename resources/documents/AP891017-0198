Men firing automatic weapons killed Ana Isabel Casanova, astudent who was celebrating her 23rd birthday, in her car a blockfrom her home.   In San Salvador, the government blamed insurgents for theattack, but the language in the claim of responsibility was unlikethat used by the rebels in the past.   A man purporting to speak for the ``joint command'' of urbanguerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front calledat least one radio station in El Salvador to claim responsibilityfor the attack.   The caller said the attack was meant to underline demands forthe release of a missing unionist allegedly arrested by securityforces and to call for an end to repression by government securityforces.   However, rebel leaders in El Salvador said in statement, ``It istotally false that urban commandos from the FMLN killed Miss IsabelCasanova, and we reiterate it is not FMLN policy to attempt againstthe lives of relatives of military chiefs.''   The rebel leaders said the slaying was part of ``psychologicalwarfare'' that the Salvadoran military high command's intelligencedivision and the press office is waging against them.   ``It is highly suspicious that this occurs just when thismeeting is taking place and the intention to speedily blame theFMLN for the attack,'' the rebel leaders said in the statement,which was also handed out in San Jose.   ``Anyone can pick up the telephone and say he's from the FMLN,''rebel spokeswoman Nidia Diaz told reporters as she distributed thestatement.   There has been little progress reported in the two days of talksbetween the rebels and the rightist government of President AlfredoCristiani. The government has proposed a cease-fire without theeconomic, political and legal reforms the Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front guerrillas insist on.   Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador and awitness at the talks, said the negotiating process ``allows hope,not for spectacular results, but for them, at the end, to reach aminimal agreement that allows work to continue so that a peaceagreement finally is signed.''   Rebels said the assassination of the colonel's daughter, likethe removal of rebel sympathizers during a peace vigil at theMetropolitan Cathedral in San Salvador, would not interrupt thetalks.   The Costa Rica talks are the second meeting between thegovernment and rebels since the opening session occurred in MexicoCity in September.   A previous round of dialogue between the government and rebels,in October 1987, was broken off because of the assassination ofHerbert Anaya, leader of a leftist human rights group.   The Front said Tuesday it proposed purging the armed forces ofits top officers, including Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Larios;Gen. Juan Rafael Bustillo, the air force chief; and Col. RenePonce, chief of the joint chiefs of staff'   ``The majority of those officers have accumulated large economicinterests through corruption,'' the rebel proposal says. ``They areinvolved or directly linked to acts of repression and crime.''   Rosa Chavez, who with Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas hasmediated contact between the guerrillas and government for severalyears, said the two sides were trying Tuesday to agree on whatconstitutes a cease-fire in the war, which has killed an estimated70,000 people, most of them civilians.</TEXT></DOC>
