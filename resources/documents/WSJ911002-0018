The company, the nation's largest commercial real-estatebrokerage firm and formerly called Coldwell Banker CommercialGroup, gained approval from its chief lender, Sumitomo BankLtd. of Tokyo, for the plan. It would reduce to below 6% thecombined interest rate on $168.4 million of bank debt and $62million in subordinated debt. Interest on the bank financingpreviously was around 8.25% and for the subordinated debtabout 9.75%. CB said Sumitomo agreed to extend to 1995 from1992 the beginning of principal payments on the debt, whichwas amassed following CB's leveraged acquisition from Sears,Roebuck andamp; Co. in April 1989.</LP><TEXT>   Carlyle Group, a Washington, D.C., merchant bank, led the$305 million buy-out with Coldwell Banker employees,managers, members of the Mellon family and other outsideinvestors.   CB said it also arranged for Sumitomo to expand by another$20 million an existing $20 million revolving line of credit,which had shrunk to $5 million as the company used up therest to meet expenses.   The restructuring, which is to be announced this morning,comes as the company struggles with a burden of LBO-relatedcosts and a sharp downturn in real estate revenue thatcontributed to losses that left it with a negative net worthof $56.8 million as of June 30. CB lost $47.2 million in thefirst half of this year, wider than the $35 million loss forthe same period a year ago, as revenue sank 27% to $154.1million. Part of the recent loss stemmed from a paper chargeof $26.1 million on amortization of intangible assets, butdebt expenses of $12.6 million along with operating expensesconsumed CB's available cash.   Amid the losses, CB executives have struggled to parecosts, closing 14 offices and firing 750 staffers since theLBO was completed. Under the new restructuring, CB officialssaid three more offices will be closed. They also canceled $1million in advisory agreements with Carlyle Group andSumitomo. CB's top 10 executives volunteered to take pay cutsranging from 3% to 20%. James J. Didion, chairman and chiefexecutive officer, is taking a 20% cut on his salary, whichthe firm declined to disclose.   In addition, preferred shareholders agreed to deferdividends, scheduled to begin next year, until CB's debt ispaid in full. An industry source said this would amount tobetween $20 million and $25 million in savings over fiveyears.   Combined with the previous cost-cutting steps, therestructuring will result in savings of more than $37 millionin operating expenses in 1992 from 1990 levels, Mr. Didionsaid. He said the savings would enable the company tocontinue even if the real estate depression extends into nextyear. &quot;We can now look forward to operating the business witha long-range view and confidence,&quot; Mr. Didion said.   Within the industry, CB's restructuring was widely viewedas gaining it some breathing room, but not erasing itsfinancial difficulties. &quot;It just stretches out the loan,which facilitates their survivability,&quot; said one executive.   Julien J. Studley, chairman of the rival Julien J. StudleyInc. commercial real-estate brokerage firm based in New York,said CB's operating losses are so high that he questionswhether the firm can remain viable, even when not factoringin the debt. He said one of CB's biggest problems is that ithas specialized in the hardest-hit areas of real estate, landsales and commercial building rentals, and is slow toinitiate changes. &quot;They need God to help them solve theproblem,&quot; Mr. Studley said.   CB's problems are compounded, analysts say, by the widelyheld belief that the commercial real-estate slump will lastfor several more years.   CB officials bristled at the criticism, saying they areindustry leaders in virtually every commercial real-estatebrokerage category, and that its competitors are also reelingfrom the downturn. Jesse Harrill, CB senior vice presidentand executive director, corporate communications, also saidthat while his company is cutting where it can, it continuesto beef up a brokerage sales force that stood at 2,017nationwide as of August compared with 1,989 in January 1990.The brokers are on 100% commission, including some who lostmanagement positions because of office closures and went onto become brokers elsewhere.   &quot;The brokers are the engine that drives this company,&quot; Mr.Harrill said. Even they got into the cost-cutting spirit, Mr.Harrill said, recommending that 1992's annual salesrecognition conference be canceled. Management agreed to therecommendation and will divert the money saved into improvedcomputerization and broker training.</TEXT></DOC>
