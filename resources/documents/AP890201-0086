(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a subdivision one elderly residentsaid was no place for ``screaming kids,'' a 14-year-old girl quietlymoved from her parents' home to keep them out of jail.   Staci Elmer moved in with her married brother Tuesday afterCircuit Judge Wayne Cobb refused to block her eviction in a disputeover deed restrictions that bar children under 15.   The girl's parents faced 10 days in jail if their daughter _ whoturns 15 in two months _ had not moved out by 5 p.m.   ``This morning Staci said, `I feel the whole world is againstme,''' Mrs. Elmer said Tuesday. ``It's child abuse. It is. It reallyis. If I had thrown Staci out in the street, I'd be in jail orbefore a judge.''   The Elmers admit they knew that children were prohibited whenthey moved into their double-wide mobile home on the back streets ofthe rural community in 1987.   The subdivision covers two blocks and is home to 17 families, allretired except the Elmers. The neighbors took the Elmers to court,and in August a judge upheld the deed restrictions and ordered Staciout. The Elmers didn't budge.   Earlier this month, another judge found the couple in contemptand set the Jan. 31 deadline.   The Elmers' attorney, Mary Greenwood, asked for a stay untilmid-March, when amendments to the federal housing law banning agediscrimination take effect. Cobb refused but said the teen-agercould visit her parents.   Staci, who will be 15 on April 7, is a student who makes A's andB's and spends four nights a week practicing acrobatics, ballet andother types of dancing.   ``I'm not surprised,'' she told her mother. ``The Constitutionisn't made for kids.''   After the hearing, Mrs. Elmer packed up clothes, two blankets,Staci's favorite pillow, a curling iron and her daughter's dance bag.   ``We all love Staci, and we think it's terrible what's happeningto her,'' said Terry Elmer, wife of her 25-year-old brother Darwin.``Staci's really close to both her parents. She's got to be one ofthe nicest teen-agers I've ever known.''   ``We're all elderly people,'' said Mildred Spittler, who with herhusband, Lawrence, sued to force Staci out. ``Once the restrictionsare broken, anyone can come in here with a mess of kids, and ourquiet two streets are gone.''   ``We don't need a bunch of screaming children,'' she said.  </TEXT></DOC>
