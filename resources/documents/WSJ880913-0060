As a result of the sale, General Automation will take a $3.8 million after-tax write-off in the fiscal fourth ended June 30, a spokesman said.    General Automation, a computer concern based in Anaheim, Calif., acquired Parallel Computers in April 1987 for about $3 million in stock and warrants.    But Parallel Computers proved a disappointment. General Automation said expenses related to the acquisition were partly responsible for a $2.2 million net loss in the nine months ended March 31. Revenue for the period was $37 million.    In fiscal 1987, General Automation had net income of $1.6 million, or 33 cents a share, including tax credits of $1.1 million. Revenue was $42.8 million.    General Automation closed at $1.50, up 12.5 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
