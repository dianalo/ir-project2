Harold B. Finger, president of the U.S. Council for EnergyAwareness, made the comment, coincidentally, as officials at a NorthCarolina nulear plant announced they had shut down a reactor after asmall amount of radioactive steam was released into the air.   Officials at the McGuire nuclear plant, near Charlotte, declaredan ``alert'' _ the second-least serious of four emergency categories_ and said the release of radioactivity was caused by a pipe leak.They said there was no danger to the public.   Finger, whose group promotes nuclear power, spoke at a newsconference to present a paper on the future of the industry. He saidthat unless atomic plants are built in the 1990s the nation wouldface electricity shortages.   No orders to build nuclear reactors have been placed since 1978,and some utility officials say it's unlikely any more plants will bebuilt in this century.   While acknowledging ``there is a general concern about nuclearenergy'' among the public, Finger said the main reason people opposebuilding nuclear plants in their area is doubt about the need formore electrical generating capacity.   ``The American public does not know we're headed into this periodof very serious electricity need,'' Finger said.   Finger said the public's views on nuclear power are notinfluenced greatly by publicity about accidents and safetyviolations at atomic reactors, such as the shutdown of the two PeachBottom reactors in Pennsylvania in March 1987 after control roomworkers were caught sleeping on the job.   Environmental groups opposed to nuclear power point to incidentssuch as Peach Bottom, and the less serious pipe leak at McGuire onWednesday, as reasons to expect the public to continue opposing thebuilding of new nuclear plants.   ``These kinds of mishaps, some more serious than others, continueto erode public confidence in commercial nuclear power plants,''Scott Denman, director of the anti-nuclear Safe Energy CommunicationCouncil, said in a telephone interview.   Public opinion on nuclear power also has been hurt by recentpublicity about lax safety standards and environmental hazards atEnergy Department reactors that produce material for nuclearweapons, said James J. O'Connor, chairman of Commonwealth Edison Co.of Chicago. All of the government reactors have been shut downtemporarily because of safety, technical and managerial problems.</TEXT></DOC>
