No date has been set for a resumption of contract negotiations,which ended Oct. 2, two days before the strike started. Industryanalysts said the strike almost certainly would last another weekand possibly two months or more.   The 57,800 Boeing employees represented by the InternationalAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers were enjoyingdonations of pizza, supermarket food and other support. They alsowere being advised on ways to prepare for financial, marital andother pressures.   Linda Lanham of Machinists District Lodge 751, representing43,300 Boeing workers in the Puget Sound area, said legislators,members of Congress and state and national labor leaders were beinginvited to a rally at the union hall and a march to Boeing'scorporate headquarters Oct. 21.   She said she hoped at least 2,000 people would participate.   Meanwhile, Boeing was preparing to deliver the fifth plane sincethe strike began Oct. 4, a 747-400 for China Air of Taiwan, saidchief corporate spokesman Harold Carr. The planes were alreadyassembled before the walkout, and non-striking employees have beenputting the finishing touches on them. The company says it hasabout three dozen more planes that might be prepared for deliverywhile the workers are on strike.   Boeing said Friday that Martinair Holland has ordered four morewide-body 767-300ER jetliners, worth approximately $326 million.   So far this month, Boeing has received orders and options for106 planes worth approximately $7.5 billion. For the year, Boeinghas received firm orders for 792 planes worth about $42.3 billion,an industry record.   Wolfgang Demisch of UBS Securities in New York said that nobodyhad expected a strike to last less than two weeks, ``so after this(weekend) the real strike begins, so to speak.''   Talks could resume in the next week, ``and in the next two weeksI think you might see some tangible motion,'' Demisch said.   ``I've said one to two months all along, and I don't see anyreason to change that,'' said William Whitlow of Dain Bosworth inSeattle.   Boeing's three-year offer included wage hikes of 4 percent, 3percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay this yearand 3 percent in 1990, a cost-of-living clause almost matchinginflation, a reduction in mandatory overtime and increases in somebenefits. The unions are seeking bigger wage increases, lessreliance on bonuses, and an end to mandatory overtime.   By late Friday no union members in the region were known to befacing eviction or other financial crises, but enough were worriedto keep five people almost constantly on the phone in the union'slocal welfare office, said Lou Kiefer, a specialist from IAMheadquarters in Washington, D.C.   Similar services were being offered to union members in Wichita,Kan., Portland, Ore., and lesser Boeing job sites in Montana,Hawaii, California, Utah and other states.   Kiefer said creditors generally were agreeing to accept reducedor delayed payments during the duration of the strike.   ``When they get a creditor that's uncooperative, they call usand in some cases we call the creditor,'' he said.   ``We tell them we'll take some pickets off the line and bringthem over to the loan company,'' Kiefer said. ``We haven't had onehold out on us yet.''   Under federal law the strikers are being offered five optionsfor paying to retain some health, accident, death and disabilityinsurance coverage, said Kiefer and Al Wydick, another health andwelfare specialist.   Without any advance word, a local pizza company sent deliverytrucks with hot pizzas for pickets at a number of plant gates,Lanham said.   Pat Newberry, owner of two McDonalds outlets, loaned a 10-galloncooler and is donating six gallons of orange-drink mix and 600disposable cups a week, she said.   Lee Frazier and Rob Miller are letting the union select $50worth of free goods from each of their three groceries everyWednesday, she said.   Steve Witt of the QFC supermarket in Kent arranged for the unionto get ``tons of produce and tons of bakery items,'' Bowman said.</TEXT></DOC>
