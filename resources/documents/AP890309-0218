RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The barrage of unsolicited advice being pressedon the Supreme Court as it re-examines abortion rights illustratesthe complex role public opinion plays in the court's search forjustice.   Dozens of partsans, including the Bush administration, are tryingto sway the court as it prepares to hear arguments next month overMissouri abortion regulations. The lobbying has yielded 46``friend-of-the-court'' legal briefs.   The court, expected to rule by July, is being asked to use thecase to overturn or limit its landmark 1973 decision legalizingabortion.   Is the court influenced by such external pressure?   ``Never for a very long period is the court out of touch with thepopulace,'' said Thomas G. Krattenmaker, associate dean at theGeorgetown University law school. ``They're always sensitive to whatthey perceive to be the shared values of Americans.''   Although public opinion polls indicate that most Americans favora woman's right to abortion, the anti-abortion Bush administrationwants to leave the final word to state legislatures, not the highcourt.   Justice Department lawyers are asking the court to declare thereis no constitutional right to abortion _ leaving states free torestrict or outlaw abortions.   They said public opinion should be given more weight than thecourt's 16 years' worth of decisions on abortion. ``Indeed, the factthat this issue touches or can touch nearly everyone's life ...means that it should be capable of resolution through the process ofpolitical dialogue,'' the administration contended.   Many constitutional experts agree that the nation's mood has animpact on the outcome of the court's most significant rulings.   ``In the sense what would happen if you took a Gallup poll, theimpact of public opinion is tiny,'' said Bruce Fein, a conservativelawyer who watches court cases closely.   ``But in a general sense of what is fair, what is just and whatis right, (public opinion) is not going to be always decisive but itis always in the background,'' he said.   Years ago the notion that the high court reflects popularsentiment was expressed succinctly by Finley Peter Dunne, the authorwho penned the phrase, ``No matter whether the Constitution followsthe flag or not, the Supreme Court follows the election returns.''   The truth probably is more complicated.   Georgetown's Krattenmaker said that in any given case the courtis more likely to be influenced by an elite group than by the man inthe street.   ``Any political scientist will tell you this is the way anypolicymaker acts,'' Krattenmaker said. ``He's sensitive to an elitegroup of people.''   For Supreme Court justices, he said the elite group usuallyincludes lower court judges, high-ranking government officials and,to some extent, legal experts.   Jerome Barron, a law professor at George Washington University,said a recent decision striking down an affirmative action plan inRichmond, Va., may be an example of the justices ``following theelection returns.''   But Barron noted that the court today is a more conservative one.``That's public opinion, too. A more conservative president appointsmore conservative justices,'' he said.   Throughout the court's history, some have accused it of beingmore interested in results than applying the law and interpretingthe Constitution impartially.   But usually the charge is made by those who feel disadvantaged bya court ruling.   Many have noted that the court always confronts competingpressures: that it be independent from rapidly shifting publicopinion but close enough to the mainstream that it not forfeit itslegitimacy as an institution of the democratic will.   ``Never in its 200-year history has the court been out ofsynchronization with the general public for more than five or 10years,'' said court-watcher Fein.   Before the Civil War, the court bucked public opinion in theNorth when it ruled that Dred Scott remained a slave after hetraveled into free territory.   The ruling is blamed for reducing the court's stature to itsall-time low and undermining its authority.   When court decisions of the 1950s and 1960s dramatically expandedcivil and individual rights, some said the court was drifting farfrom the American mainstream.   The chief justice became a lightning rod for criticism byconservatives, and ``Impeach Earl Warren'' billboards appeared.   But two decades later, many of the Warren court's mostcontroversial rulings remain the law of the land _ and have becomegenerally accepted.   Public opinion polls and even demonstrations outside its buildingare not likely to sway the court, but the justices acknowledge thatexpressions of popular sentiment can have an impact.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist reportedly once told a groupof newspaper reporters and editors that a cogent editorial could beinfluential.   He is said to have commented wryly that the court is interestedin solid, logical arguments ``no matter how unlikely the source.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 12</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
