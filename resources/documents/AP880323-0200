Mark Lamos, 42, artistic director of the Hartford Stage Co. ofConnecticut, received a standing ovation after the openingperformance of O'Neill's 1924 play about the struggle for dominancebetween father and son on a 19th-century New England farm.   Lamos had to confront linguistic and cultural barriers inbringing the play before a Soviet audience.   The 870 people at the performance applauded politely in rhythmfor the Soviet actors, and then rose to applaud energetically forLamos.   The director, wearing a dappled blazer and red tie, was given anornately painted samovar and bouquet of flowers. He plucked one outand presented it to the lead actress, Nina Popova, who was still intears from the final wrenching scene.   ``The feeling of great personality is missing,'' AlexanderAronov, who writes for the youth newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets,said in an interview.   He said he believed Lamos strayed from O'Neill's conception,although the actors' movements and attire seemed more American thanprevious Soviet performances of the play he had seen.   Lamos said he believed his version was closer to O'Neill'sbecause the original Russian translation was too poetic and smooth.He said during a break in a rehearsal Tuesday that he tried to tonedown what he called the overemotional and unnatural style of theactors.   Several Soviets in the audience said they found the language inLamos' version too crude.   Aronov said part of the blame should be placed on the actors ofMoscow's Pushkin Theater, with the exception of Ms. Popova.   O'Neill and Tennessee Williams are the best known and best lovedAmerican playwrights in the Soviet Union. Lamos said Soviets knowlittle about other American playwrights, especially morecontemporary ones whose work he prefers, and was unhappy with thechoice of ``Desire Under the Elms'' for his direction.   ``The exposition of the play is a bit crudely done,'' Lamos said.   The play was chosen by the Pushkin Theater's artistic director,Yuri Yeremin, as an appropriate way to celebrate the centennial ofO'Neill's 1888 birth.   ``Desire Under the Elms'' was the first play performed in thePushkin Theater in 1926 and has become a standard in the Sovietrepertoire.   Lamos was invited to stage the play in Moscow after he met agroup of Soviet theater directors in New York last summer.   Another American, Nagle Jackson of the McCarter Theater inPrinceton, N.J., is directing a production of ``The GlassMenagerie'' by Williams that is scheduled to open later this yearat Leningrad's Gorky Theater. Two other Americans are scheduled todirect plays in Moscow in the fall.   Lamos relied on a Soviet interpreter to communicate with theall-Soviet cast and crew.   Language difficulties seemed especially severe when he was firstreviewing the script with the actors and came across the phrase``to pull the wool over his eyes,'' he recalled.   When Lamos explained that the phrase meant to fool someone, theactors came up with a Russian equivalent _ which translates into``he has noodles on his ears.''   The American didn't believe the expression was appropriate, buthe said one participant chimed in: ``Let me put it this way, Mark,we've had noodles over our ears in this country for 70 years.''</TEXT></DOC>
