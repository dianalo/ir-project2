These credit unions shall provide servicesto DoD personnel of all ranks and grades within their respective fieldsof membership. (b) <T3>Limitation on Service. </T3>(1) Only one credit union shall establisha branch or facility on a DoD installation, and its field of membershipnormally shall include all assigned DoD personnel. For the purposes ofthis provision, an automated teller machine owned or operated by a creditunion shall be considered a credit union facility. On installations wheremore than one credit union already exists, each is entitled to the benefitsdefined in this part. (2) As described in section G., Appendix of this part, commanders of installationsserved by onbase credit unions shall ensure that installation activitiesdo not disseminate literature from competing credit unions. (c) <T3>Establishing Domestic Credit Union Service. </T3>(1) A demonstratedneed for credit union services may be addressed by establishing a new full-servicecredit union or by opening a branch office or facility of an existing creditunion under the common bond principle. (2) Each DoD Component shall develop internal instructions, consistentwith the following, that govern the submission and justification of requeststo establish credit unions on respective installations. (i) DoD personnel seeking to establish a new full-service credit unionor a branch or facility of an existing credit union shall submit a proposalto the installation commander. Such proposals shall be forwarded throughchannels to the DoD Component headquarters concerned, together with recommendationsfor acceptance or rejection. (ii) The DoD Component shall notify credit unions that operate on DoD installationsof the need for service; review the specific proposals of interested creditunions; coordinate with its field commands as appropriate; and recommendfor approval the designation of a credit union to the appropriate regulatoryagency, providing an information copy to the DASD(MS). No specific NCUAapproval is required for a Federal credit union to open a branch office.(iii) No commitment may be made to a credit union regarding its proposaluntil the appropriate regulatory agency has announced a selection. (d) <T3>Establishing Overseas Credit Union Service. </T3>(1) When the installation(community) commander determines that credit union services are neededwithin an existing geographic franchise (see paragraph H.2., Appendix ofthis part), and the DoD Component headquarters concurs, it shall contactthe servicing Defense credit union to establish a branch or facility. Thebasic decision concerning such extensions of service rests with the creditunions. If the NCUA has not established a geographic franchise, the DoDComponent concerned shall canvass existing Defense credit unions for proposalsto establish a branch or facility. (2) In addition to the requirements stated in paragraph (b)(2) of thissection, installation commanders shall provide the following informationin support of requests to their DoD Component headquarters for overseascredit union service: (i) In countries not presently served, a statement concurred in by theUnified Commander that the requirement has been coordinated with the U.S.Chief of Diplomatic Mission or U.S. Embassy and that the host country willpermit the operation, with any conditions imposed by the host-country identified.(ii) The name and location of the nearest credit union branch or facility.(iii) The distance between the installation and the nearest credit unionbranch or facility and the availability of any official or public transportation.(iv) The number of DoD personnel in duty assignments that confine themto the installation, or who cannot obtain transportation (such as hospitalpatients). (3) The DoD Component shall notify Federal credit unions that operate onDoD installations of this need; review the specific proposals of interestedcredit unions; and coordinate with its field commands as appropriate. Preferenceshall be given to proposals that offer full-service credit union operations.After coordination with the DASD(MS), the DoD component shall recommenddesignation of a particular credit union to the NCUA for approval. (4) Recommendations to the NCUA shall include identification of the primaryinstallation from which the proposed branch would operate and the geographicalterritory in which any additional branches, facilities, or mobile outletswould operate. (5) No commitment may be made to a credit union regarding its proposaluntil the NCUA announces its selection. The DoD Component shall then notifythe DASD(MS) of NCUA approval and arrange for operations to begin. (e) <T3>Operating Agreements. </T3>An operating agreement, conforming to theguidelines set forth herein, shall be executed and maintained between eachinstallation (community) commander and the onbase credit union. (1) Each agreement shall be confined to basic relationships and mutualsupport activities and may not involve internal operations of the creditunion. The installation commander shall agree to provide support as specifiedin this Part. A sample format is contained in DoD 4000.19-R. (2) Each credit union operating on a DoD installation shall agree to: (i) Comply with this Part, 32 CFR Part 231, and DoD Component regulationsthat implement these issuances; (ii) Keep the installation commander advised of credit union operations;(iii) Give the installation commander a copy of its monthly financial reportand other local credit union publications; (iv) Invite command representatives to attend its annual meetings and otherappropriate functions; (v) Indemnify and hold harmless the U.S. Government from (and against)any loss, expense, claim, or demand to which the Government may be subjectedas a result of death, loss, destruction, or damage in conjunction withthe use and occupancy of premises of the DoD Component in any way causedby agents or employees of the credit union; (vi) Maintain physical security of cash and negotiable items in a mannerconsistent with the requirements of the credit union's fidelity insurer.A copy of these requirements shall be provided to the installation commanderupon request. (vii) Accommodate, whenever possible, local command requests for lecturersand printed materials for consumer credit education programs. Credit unionpersonnel invited to participate in such programs shall not use the occasionto promote the exclusive services of a particular financial institution;(viii) Provide that neither the DoD Component concerned nor its representativesshall be responsible for the financial operation of a credit union or forany expense, loss (including criminal losses), or claim for damages arisingfrom credit union operations; and (ix) Operate in accordance with the guidelines at Appendix and comply withother provisions of this part, with 32 CFR Part 231 and with their DoDComponent implementing regulations. (f) <T3>Liaison Officers. </T3>To maintain effective lines of communication,each commander of an installation with an onbase credit union shall appointa credit union liaison officer as defined at enclosure 2 of DoD Directive1000.11. (1) The credit union liaison officer's name and duty telephone number shallbe displayed in the lobby of each onbase credit union location. (2) The liaison officer shall maintain regular contact with the creditunion manager to confer, help resolve member complaints, and discuss quantitativeand qualitative improvements in the services provided.

This percentage criterionapplies to the total credit union membership, not just to members who usethe onbase office. (ii) Prior to renewal of each no-cost lease or license, the credit unionshall provide a written certification, prepared on credit union letterheadand signed either by its president or general manager, that the creditunion continues to meet the 95 percent criterion. A certification alsois required whenever there is a merger, takeover or significant changein a field of membership. This certification shall serve as justificationand documentation for the continued allocation of free Government space,including space renovated or constructed with credit union funds. (2) <T3>Criteria for Use of Space in Government-Owned Buildings.</T3> (i) Acredit union may be provided space on a DoD installation at one or morelocations by no-cost permits or licenses for periods not to exceed 5 years,as prescribed in DoD Directive 4165.6. The cumulative total of space authorizedat one or more locations is subject to the limitations contained in DoD4270.1-M. (ii) A credit union that fails to meet the 95 percent criterion shall becharged fair market rent for space provided. No credit union whose fieldof membership excludes any DoD personnel assigned on the installation shallreceive free Government space. This latter limitation is waived in caseswhen an installation is served by more than one credit union. (iii) All space assigned by the GSA, whether leased or in Federal officebuildings, is reimbursable to the GSA at the standard level user chargeunder Pub. L. 92-313. Consequently, the GSA shall charge the benefitingDoD Component for any space assigned for credit union operations. Suchspace is then subject to the provisions of paragraphs (h)(2) (i) and (ii)of this section. (iv) When a credit union uses its own funds to expand, modify, or renovateGovernment-owned space, a no-cost permit or license may be provided fora period not to exceed 25 years. Duration of the permit or license shallbe commensurate with the extent of the improvements as determined by theDoD Component concerned. It shall be effective until the agreed date ofexpiration or until the credit union ceases to satisfy the 95 percent criterion.In this latter case, the no-cost permit shall be cancelled in favor ofa lease immediately negotiated at fair market value under the provisionsof paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section. (3) <T3>Utilities, Base Services, and Equipment.</T3> (i) When available, janitorialservices, utilities (such as air conditioning, heat, and light), fixtures,and maintenance shall be furnished at no cost to a credit union occupyingfree space in a Government building.

Clearance involves reporting a change of address,reaffirming allotments or notes payable and arranging for counseling, ifappropriate. Clearance shall not be denied to facilitate the collectionof debts or the resolution of disputes between the credit union and itsdeparting members. Where administratively feasible, similar clearance proceduresshall be used for departing DoD civilian employees. (4) <T3>Additional Support in Overseas Areas. </T3>In addition to the logisticsupport identified above, the following may be made available to Defensecredit unions operating at overseas installations: (i) Military postal service may be authorized, in accordance with DoD Directive4525.6.

Passage of title to facilities will be deferred until allextensions have expired. Such extensions shall be for periods not to exceedfive years at the appraised fair market rental of the land only as determinedon the date of each such extension. The credit union will continue to maintainthe premises and pay for utilities and services furnished in accordancewith 32 CFR Part 288. (4) When, under the terms of a lease or extension, title to improvementspasses to the Government, the credit union shall be given first choiceto continue occupying those improvements under a facility lease.(i) The lease shall require the credit union to maintain the premises andpay for utilities and services furnished in accordance with 32 CFR Part288.

This lease provisionalso shall be offered if a credit union requests up to 250 square feetof land to construct, at its expense, a kiosk or other structure to housean ATM. In either case, the charge for any maintenance, utilities and servicesshall be consistent with that applied to the onbase credit union office.(iii) Leases pertaining to other situations shall be negotiated  in accordancewith paragraphs (g)(2) and (h) of this section. (l) <T3>Termination of Credit Union Service</T3>_ (1) <T3>Termination of Operations by the Credit Union. </T3>An onbase creditunion planning to terminate its operations should notify the installationcommander at least 90 days before the closing date. This notification shouldprecede public announcement of the planned closure. When appropriate, thecommander shall attempt to negotiate an agreement permitting the creditunion to continue operations until the installation has made other arrangements.Immediately upon notification of a closing, the commander shall advisethe DoD Component headquarters concerned. If it is determined that continuationof credit union services is justified, action to establish another creditunion shall comply with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. (2) <T3>Termination for Cause. </T3>If, after discussion with credit unionofficials, the installation commander determines that the operating policiesof the credit union are inconsistent with this Instruction, a recommendationfor termination of logistic support and space arrangements may be madethrough DoD Component channels.
