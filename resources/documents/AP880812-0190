(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mississippi legislators worked Friday topass anti-corruption legislation inspired by an FBI investigationthat led to guilty verdicts against dozens of county officials, butthe House and Senate were not in agreement.   The federal investigation into corrupt county purchasingpractices has resulted in charges ranging from extortion to mailfraud against 56 supervisors in 25 counties. Of those, 42 havepleaded guilty, six have been convicted, one has been acquitted,one died before going to trial, one died after sentencing, andanother was declared mentally incompetent to stand trial. Theremaining ones still have charges pending.   The state Senate prepared Friday to consider its version of acounty government reorganization bill, approval of which wouldrequire negotiations between that chamber and the House.   The House passed a measure Friday dealing with purchasing laws.   The lawmakers were in their third day of a special sessioncalled by Gov. Ray Mabus, who took office in January pushing countygovernment reform as one of the four main goals of his firstlegislative session. The House and Senate were unable to agree on abill during their 120-day regular session earlier this year.   Mabus was state auditor for the four years before he was electedgovernor, and he assisted the FBI in its ``Operation Pretense''investigation of corrupt county purchasing.   The county reorganization bill was endorsed Friday by the SenateCounty Affairs Committee after it substituted language in a measurepassed Thursday by the House with that proposed by state Sen. EddieBriggs of DeKalb.   State Sen. Bill Renick of Ashland said the House version was``merely the bill that we saw during the regular session.'' Hesaid: ``It was heinous then, it's heinous now.''   Mabus has claimed the ``beat system,'' still in use in 60 ofMississippi's 82 counties, invites public officials to steal. Underthat system, supervisors maintain control over daily operations intheir individual districts.   Mabus has pushed for a law that would require counties to adoptthe so-called county unit system, under which the five countysupervisors would set policy and hire an administrator to overseeday-to-day operations.   The purchasing law measure passed 118-0 Friday by the Housewould allow governmental bodies to buy items costing less than $500and not have to follow the purchase prices set by the state Officeof General Services through competitive bids.   The Senate Judiciary Committee worked Friday to incorporatepurchasing law revisions in the Senate version of the county unitbill.   The Senate version of the bill differs in several ways from thatapproved by the House, although both would mandate centralpurchasing and inventory control systems for counties.   Both would provide for referendums in each county, allowingvoters to decide if their counties would construct and maintainroads on a centralized basis, although the versions would word thequestion differently.   The Senate provisions would allow counties to hireadministrators, but would not require them to do so. The chanceryclerk could agree to serve as county administrator, or aspurchasing or receiving clerk. The House language would mandatehiring of an administrator.   Both bills would require road managers for counties choosingcentral road construction and maintenance. The Senate version wouldprohibit the county engineer from serving as county road manager.   Both versions would require separate clerks for purchasing,receiving and inventory control, but lawmakers have said thosecould come from existing personnel.   The 1988 legislative session ended with three-member negotiatingteams from the House and Senate refusing to budge in areas wherethe chambers differed, killing the county unit legislation. Mabusthen vetoed a bill that would have given 20 percent pay raises tothe state's 410 supervisors.</TEXT></DOC>
