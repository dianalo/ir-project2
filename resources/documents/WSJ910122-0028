Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, speaking after two daysof meetings by the so-called Group of Seven, refused todiscuss how much the Germans and the Japanese may contributeto the Gulf effort. But there was widespread speculation atthe meetings that Japan will boost its aid by several billiondollars, and perhaps as much as $5 billion to $10 billion. Inaddition, a senior Treasury official said, &quot;I didn't senseany hesitancy on the part of the Germans&quot; to increaseeconomic assistance to poor nations in the Mideast.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Burden-sharing is part of the operation in the Gulf,&quot;said Mr. Brady, who added that the Japanese and other allies&quot;want to do their share.&quot; There has been strong criticism inthe U.S., especially against Japan, for the limitedassistance to the U.S.-led campaign against Iraq's occupationof Kuwait.   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto declined tospecify the size of any further aid, but told reportersyesterday, &quot;I hope that whatever the {additional} amount willbe that will be put to us will not go beyond $10 billion.&quot;Japanese officials have said in the last few days that Tokyowould increase its aid from the $4 billion already pledged tothe U.S. military and to Mideast countries whose economieshave suffered because of the conflict.   The Germans sounded cautious about further contributions.&quot;We can't say today what further contribution we may make,&quot;German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in an interview lastnight. Earlier in the day, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl saidin Bonn that Germany &quot;will have to deliver considerably morefinancial help,&quot; but added that he couldn't mention amountsuntil he knew more about the total cost of Operation DesertStorm. Germany has promised about $3 billion in aid.   According to congressional estimates, the Persian Gulf waris adding at least $600 million a day to the Pentagon'sbudget.   In its statement on the world economy, the G-7 said thatsound fiscal and monetary policies &quot;should create conditionsfavorable to lower global interest rates and a stronger worldeconomy.&quot; The group's brief, relatively bland statementadded: &quot;The pace of {economic} activity could be expected topick up later this year.&quot;   The Gulf war shouldn't necessarily interfere with thebrighter prospects. &quot;Provided the war doesn't last a hugelength of time, there's no reason to think that the worldeconomy couldn't go and absorb the consequences of theconflict,&quot; said Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor of theExchequer. Mr. Lamont said Britain had suggested that Japancontribute to Britain's war effort, and said he will raisethe issue with his German counterpart.   The G-7 -- which consists of the U.S., Japan, Germany,Canada, Britain, Italy and France -- took pains to emphasizestability and cooperation, particularly because of the Gulfconflict. The leaders generally said they are satisfied bythe stability of financial markets in the first few days ofthe conflict, but stressed they are prepared to intervene inforeign-exchange markets -- or take other appropriate action-- to maintain stability in international markets.   Thus far, though, no such intervention has been neededsince the outbreak of war, Secretary Brady said. &quot;The patternwe've seen so far is a pattern of real stability,&quot; said Mr.Brady.   Nevertheless, the world's financial leaders pledged to beextra watchful, saying they would &quot;strengthen cooperation andmonitor developments in exchange markets.&quot; For now, thismainly means they will be talking to one another more. &quot;Thetelephones will remain open,&quot; Mr. Brady said. However, theG-7 didn't opt for any system of rough ranges for exchangerates, Mr. Brady and his colleagues said.   Despite the G-7's expectations of generally lower interestrates, Germany appears unlikely to lower its rates any timesoon because of the costs of unification, strong economicgrowth and concern about inflation. Recently, there have beenintensifying reports that Germany may have to raise itsinterest rates soon, perhaps as early as this week. Such amove would almost certainly act as a brake on the recentdeclines in U.S. interest rates.   On other issues, the G-7 put off a decision on the SovietUnion's membership in global organizations such as theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Recent eventsin Latvia and Lithuania, where unarmed citizens have beenshot by Soviet army units, and the move away frommarket-oriented changes have made the U.S. and the Europeansleery of more help for the Soviets. &quot;That's on hold untileveryone gets a better handle on what's going on in theBaltics,&quot; Mr. Brady said in reply to questions about Sovietmembership of international organizations.   In addition, the G-7 emphasized the importance of bringingthe stalled Uruguay Round of international trade talks to a&quot;timely and successful conclusion.&quot; Those talks, which seekto broaden and strengthen global trade accords, broke down inDecember and need to be revived before March 1. That datemarks the effective expiration of the Bush administration'sfast-track negotiating authority, under which Congress agreesto submit the whole international trade agreement to astraight up or down vote.   Debt issues also came up at the G-7 gathering. Inparticular, the G-7 members were all eager to offer Polandsome concessions on its large foreign government debt,officials at the meetings said. But there isn't a definiteagreement about the scope of such debt relief.</TEXT></DOC>
