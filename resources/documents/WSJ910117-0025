The main problem these days is thedire shortage of cash.   The confidence of China's foreign business community wasbadly shaken by the bloody suppression of demonstrations inBeijing 18 months ago. And fears that unrest could eruptshould the 86-year-old Deng Xiaoping die still make somejittery about committing significant money.</LP><TEXT>   But it is the continued grip of China's economic austerityprogram, which was launched nine months before bullets flewin Tiananmen Square in June 1989, that most affects foreigninvestment in China. In September 1988, with inflation at 30%or more in parts of the country, Beijing clamped down oncredit and reasserted central control over major constructioncontracts and foreign-exchange earnings. Inflation has easedto below 5% annually, but money is still tight.   &quot;There is no lack of interest in investment, or politicalreluctance,&quot; says a Western diplomat who tracks investment.&quot;The problem is the lack of money on the Chinese side.&quot;   Thus, China's huge infrastructure projects are goingmostly to foreign companies whose governments offer cheapfinancing, chiefly Japan and West European countries. Foreignfactories in China that sell to the domestic market arebogged down with bad debts from Chinese customers who can'tpay. Companies looking for a Chinese partner to kick incapital for joint ventures are finding mostly empty pockets.   The scarcity of cash in the industrial sector is painfullyapparent to the Western manager of a joint-venture factory.He pulls out a list of 76 creditors who owe him a total of$20 million for industrial machinery they never paid for.Following the government's instructions, he sent the list inJuly to his Beijing bank, which had been told by the StateCouncil to clear up the debts.   &quot;Seventy-five of the creditors told the bank to {forget}it,&quot; the factory manager says. &quot;These people have no money.Their factories are idle. How can I collect?&quot;   Analysts say that much of the new investment in Chinainvolves smaller companies setting up export factories incoastal cities or special economic zones. The government'spush for exports keeps the bureaucrats from bothering factorymanagers in these areas too much. And selling in foreignmarkets is considered much less risky than in China.   China releases only selected statistics, but an indicationof how foreign investment was affected by austerity and theJune 1989 violence can be discerned from figures for thefirst six months of last year, the latest period available.   The first six months of 1990 saw a drop of only 6.5% inthe number of contracts signed by foreign investors, comparedwith the first half of 1989, a period when China was ridinghigh with investors. But in the first half of 1990, thecommitted dollar value of signed contracts dropped 22% fromthe year-earlier period to $2.3 billion. In the same period,the value of U.S. investment dropped 72% to $108 million;Japan's dropped 52% to $112 million; Hong Kong and Macao'sdropped only 10% to $1.5 billion; and Europe's rose by 45% to$95 million.   One of the reasons for the drop in U.S. investment is thatmany large corporations that once dreamed of huge projects inChina now are settling for small starter ventures. MotorolaInc., for example, had been planning to invest about $250million to make semiconductors in the northern coastal cityof Tianjin. But Chinese officials say Motorola has insteaddecided to start with a $20 million facility to assemble andtest silicon chips. Officials at the company's Beijing officedeclined to comment.   According to a recent study of investment in China by theU.S.-China Business Council, Motorola is just one of manyU.S. corporations adopting this strategy. John Frisbie,director of the council's Beijing office, says that nearlyall of the council's 300 member companies have slowed theirinvestment in China.   &quot;America has to understand that the rest of the world isaggressively subsidizing their big businesses in this marketand we are not,&quot; says Christopher Morton, whose Candamp;D TradingCo. supplies power-station equipment. &quot;Without somebodystanding behind you with cheap money, you won't get theseprojects.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
