The second law of thermodynamics respects no national borders. Nor do the law of supply and demand, the Fisher effect relating interest rates to inflation, and the positive relationship between risk and return.    We know that these theoretical economic concepts do not always work out perfectly in the real world. On the other hand, we know that they are essential if we are to understand and explain prices, interest rates and investment decisions. These concepts have worked about as well in Santiago and Sydney as they have worked in Tokyo and San Francisco.    Seen from this standpoint, the broad acceptance of the current theory that budget deficits threaten the national economy -- indeed, that they must be the first order of business for President Bush -- is all the more puzzling. This theory is inconsistent across national borders.    The consensus view holds that budget deficits absorb savings and encourage consumption. The resulting shortage of savings available for private investment pushes real interest rates upward, attracting foreign capital and raising the exchange rate. The rise in the exchange rate sucks in imports and depresses exports, crowding out private investment in the process.    Therefore, we must reduce the budget deficit in order to restrain consumption, increase our domestic saving rate, and reduce our dependence on foreign capital and foreign goods. If we fail to do this, the dollar will fall in the foreign exchange markets and that will be inflationary.    Or so it is believed. But the consequences of fiscal restraint and fiscal profligacy are indeterminate and uncertain.    According to the most popular set of generalizations about the deficit, however, we should expect deficits to correlate positively with interest rates -- probably nominal but surely real -- and to correlate negatively with the trade balance and with the saving rate.               1. General Gov't. Debt Debt/GDP                         (In percent)                    1980          1986            RANK Canada            11.6%         33.7%               1 France             9.1          18.2                2 Italy             61.8          99.2                3 Germany           14.4          22.1                4 Japan             17.3          26.3                5 U.S.              19.8          28.7                6 U.K.              48.1          46.5                7   Source; National Bureau of Economic Research paper derived from OECD data; Following tables are from IMF Financial Statistics Yearbook 1988.   Consider first Table 1, showing the ratio of general government net debt to gross domestic product for the seven major industrial nations from 1980 to 1986 (complete data for 1987 still are not available).   The seven are ranked in order of the rise in their debt/GDP ratios. I have used the percentage change in the ratios here, rather than the absolute change, as the group started with such huge differences among their 1980 levels. (Absolute change is used for rankings in the other tables, where negative percentages are otherwise problematical. But this doesn't assist my argument.)   The more rapid the rise in the volume of government debt outstanding between 1980 and 1986, the larger the deficits must have been. Thus, we see that Canada ranked No. 1 with the ratio that rose the most, while Britain landed at the bottom of the list with an actual decline in the ratio of government debt to GDP.   From the viewpoint of an American, two features of this table are noteworthy.   First, the U.S. is far from being the worst sinner in running budget deficits. In fact, the U.S. shows the second-best performance here. Those outstanding examples of economic rectitude, the Germans and the Japanese, had ratios that rose even more than ours, even if by only a small amount.   Second, the level of the U.S. ratio is by no means an outlier. We are in the same ballpark as Japan and Canada. Germany is not so far below us. The U.K. and Italy are far above our level.   The remaining tables, covering interest rates, inflation, the trade balance and the saving ratio, rank the countries in the same manner, with the worst performance ranked no. 1 and the best performance ranked no. 7. In addition, each table includes the Spearman rank coefficient, relating the ranking in that table to the ranking in Table 1. If each of the other variables changed in the same order as the government debt/GDP ratio -- which is what the accepted doctrine asserts would be the case -- this coefficient would be equal to 1.00.                 2. Government Bond Yield                       (In percent)                    1980          1986            RANK Canada            12.5%          9.8%               2 France            13.0           8.4                6 Italy             16.1          10.5                7 Germany            8.5           5.9                1 Japan              9.2           4.9                5 U.S.              11.5           7.7                3 U.K.              13.8           9.9                4 SPEARMAN COEFFICIENT                           - 0.07   Table 2 shows nominal government bond yields. All seven countries enjoyed declining interest rates for 1980-86. Deficit theory hypothesizes that interest rates  should have declined the least where the growth in debt was biggest and should have declined the most where fiscal prudence was adhered to. But we see essentially no relationship in the Spearman coefficient.                     3. CPI Inflation                       (In percent)                    1980          1986            RANK Canada            10.2%          4.2%               2 France            13.3           2.5                5 Italy             21.3           5.9                7 Germany            5.4         - 0.2                1 Japan              7.7           0.6                3 U.S.              11.9           1.9                4 U.K.              18.0           3.4                6 SPEARMAN COEFFICIENT                           + 0.21   Table 3 shows the rates of change in the consumer price index, with Germany having the smallest absolute drop in the inflation rate and ranking no. 1, while Italy,  with the biggest drop, ranked no. 7.   The correlation between the change in the inflation rate and the growth in government debt is far from perfect, but it is positive. On the other hand, we can see that there is no clear relationship between budget deficits and changes in the rate of inflation. (Indeed, if we establish the rankings in terms of the percentage change in the inflation rates, the correlation turns out to be a strong negative at -0.62.)   The important feature of Table 3 is in its firm empirical support for the Fisher effect I mentioned at the outset. The correlation between the absolute change in nominal interest rates and the absolute change in inflation is an impressive 0.64.   We now come to a crucial point in the argument.   If we deduct inflation rates from nominal interest rates, the difference is equal to what is known as the real interest rate. This is the variable that government borrowing is supposed to push upward, because deficits &quot;absorb&quot; savings, causing trouble for the economy. Therefore, Table 4 shows the levels and changes in real interest rates, calculated by deducting the inflation numbers in Table 3 from the nominal interest rate numbers in Table 2.                4. Real Interest Rates                    (In percent)                   1980          1986            RANK Canada            2.3%          5.3%               7 France          - 0.3           5.9                3 Italy           - 5.2           4.6                2 Germany           3.1           6.1                5 Japan             1.5           4.3                6 U.S.            - 0.4           5.8                4 U.K.            - 4.2           6.5                1 SPEARMAN COEFFICIENT                          - 0.43   The story here is a dramatic one: the correlation is negative, and significantly so. Indeed, the U.K., with the best fiscal performance, had the widest upward movement in real interest rates, while the increase in Canadian interest rates was the smallest despite Canada's ranking at the top of Table 1. The other six countries show only a slight positive correlation.   This result flies in the face of the central element in the accepted doctrine of budget deficits. It should, however, come as no surprise to careful students of this area of economics. Rudolph Penner, senior fellow at the Urban Institute and former chief economist of the Congressional Budget Office, put it this way in the October 1988 issue of Business Economics:   &quot;In both Keynesian and classical analysis, one would expect a positive relationship between the deficit and real interest rates. This relationship has been devilishly difficult to document statistically. Although a majority of studies show a positive relationship, often it is not statistically significant, and some studies show a statistically significant negative relationship. More disturbing, small changes in the specification of the models used can change the relationship from positive to negative and vice versa.&quot;                 5. Trade Balance/GNP                      (In percent)                   1980          1986            RANK Canada           2.09%         1.26%               3 France         - 1.23          1.03                4 Italy          - 4.81          0.47                6 Germany        - 0.21          5.75                7 Japan            0.00          5.20                5 U.S.           - 0.57        - 4.37                1 U.K.             2.21        - 0.76                2 SPEARMAN COEFFICIENT                          - 0.35   What about the foreign trade balance?   Table 5 shows the ratio of the trade balance -- positive for net exports and negative  for net imports -- as a ratio of GNP. The biggest deterioration puts the U.S. as no. 1, with Germany as no. 7, the &quot;best&quot; foreign trade performance.   Lo and behold -- the correlation coefficient is negative once more. The U.S. and the U.K., whose debt/GDP ratio rose the least, show up here with the &quot;worst&quot; foreign-trade performance; they are the only two countries that swung from an export surplus in 1980 to an import surplus in 1986. Italy, with rapid growth in government borrowing and by far the highest level of debt to GDP, ended up with an impressive improvement in its trade balance.   Clearly, many forces other than fiscal policy determine what happens to the foreign trade balance.   Well, maybe the saving rate will save the theory.   Table 6 shows the ratio of consumption to GDP. The International Monetary Fund's tabulation is especially useful for our purposes, because the ratio shown here  includes government consumption -- as opposed to government investment in capital goods -- as well as private consumption.   Perhaps the deficit theory finds a fragment of support here -- the U.S. had the largest relative rise in consumption among the seven countries. Oh -- but we had one of the smallest relative increases in our national debt, so this can have little or nothing to do with U.S. fiscal policy. The relationship between deficits and saving rates appears to be essentially random (although ranking based on percentage rather than absolute changes in saving rates again produces a strong negative Spearman co-efficient).   This table makes an important point, but it does not support the accepted theory of deficits. Table 6 tells us loud and clear that high-consumption countries in 1980 tended to be even higher-consumption countries in 1986, and vice versa.                   6. Consumption/GDP*                       (In percent)                   1980          1986            RANK Canada           76.7%         81.1%               2 France           77.0          79.7                4 Italy            77.4          78.4                5 Germany          76.7          75.0                7 Japan            68.7          67.8                6 U.S.             80.6          85.1                1 U.K.             80.9          83.8                3 SPEARMAN COEFFICIENT                          + 0.07   *Both government and private consumption   The table also suggests that high consumption ratios are positively related to low export or high import surpluses. This stands to reason. Nevertheless, the correlation between consumption and government deficits and between the trade balance and government deficits is essentially nil, which means that we cannot pin this result on fiscal policy.   No, despite the stubborn insistence that cutting the deficit is the best way to raise the saving rate, its empirical foundation is weak. And its theoretical foundation is also open to argument. In an outstanding study of the outlook for the Social Security Trust Fund, Stephen J. Entin, until recently deputy assistant secretary for economic policy in the Treasury Department, writes:   &quot;It should not be assumed that {more real investment} would be the natural outcome of any and all measures to run Federal budget surpluses. This argument founders on an invalid hidden assumption. It assumes that private saving is unaffected by a massive tax increase. In reality, tax increases come predominantly out of saving, not consumption. . . .   &quot;A corporate tax rate increase or worsening of depreciation schedules reduces retained earnings and capital consumption allowances, two of the three elements of private saving, dollar for dollar with the tax increase. A tax increase on individuals with families to feed and mortgages to pay comes mainly out of savings. It also reduces the incentive to save, and leads to higher wage demands and lower business savings.&quot;   This debunking of the popular notions about budget deficits doesn't necessarily mean they are a good thing or even neutral to the economy. As a proxy for wasteful or unproductive government spending, they may ring the proper alarms. But that cannot be known absent other data, and measures to narrow deficits cannot be assumed to do more good than harm.   What this comparison does tell us is that placing the blame for the serious and stubborn problems facing the U.S. economy -- high real interest rates, trade imbalances, low savings -- on budget deficits doesn't hold up over an international sample. Is there some reason to think the U.S. case unique?   ---   Mr. Bernstein, a New York-based economic consultant, has thrice before challenged deficit gloom for the Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
