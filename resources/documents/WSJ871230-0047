The transaction is valued at $63 million.    Ohio Co., a Columbus-based investment banker that owned a majority of Funtime's approximately 3.3 million shares outstanding, previously agreed to support the proposal. The acquisition required approval by holders of at least two-thirds of preferred stock and common outstanding.The investment group is headed by Funtime's president, Dale W. VanVoorhis; executive vice president, Gasper C. Lococo; and Bruce C. Walborn, chief executive of Mills Hall Walborn, a Cleveland-based advertising and public relations firm.    Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. arranged the financing for the transaction, Funtime said. In a leveraged buyout, the purchase of a company by a small group of investors is financed largely by debt. Ultimately, the group's borrowings are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
