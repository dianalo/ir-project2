In a letter to members of a Senate subcommittee on housing, Kempsaid that HUD has ``mismanaged'' lending activities under theFederal Housing Administration, which insures $247 billion worth ofmortgages on single-family homes.   The Department of Housing and Urban Development said that FHAlost $149.5 million in the six months ending last March 31, and itslosses for the previous fiscal year totaled $369 million.   HUD officials have said the losses were a temporary phenomenonthat resulted more from a predictable rise in mortgage defaultsthat followed a spurt in the housing market.   But a report last spring by the department's inspector generalalso said some of the losses are due to fraud.   ``Despite the actions taken by the department, the Congress andour office, schemes to defraud the insurance program continue,''the inspector general's report said. ``We are unable to estimateexactly how much of the billions of dollars lost on foreclosedhomes is due to these schemes.''   The report also said: ``The department cannot continue tosustain a high level of fraud-related losses without an adverseeffect on the overall mission of the insurance fund.''   But in his letter, Kemp said FHA's 9 million borrowers were inno peril.   Kemp said FHA has surrendered most of the decision-making tooutside parties, mostly the lenders.   ``HUD has mismanaged this process such that lenders view thisdelegated authority as a right instead of a privilege, and HUD hasfailed in its efforts to firmly monitor and control lenderactivities,'' Kemp's letter said.   Kemp said FHA would improve its accounting procedures so theagency would have a better idea of the financial health of themortgage insurance fund. In addition, he said the agency would hirea large accounting firm to point out ways it can improve itsmortgage underwriting practices.</TEXT></DOC>
