Under the plan, investors would have to bring in at least one new dollar for every dollar of Argentina's $52 billion foreign debt that is capitalized. The government expects debt-equity conversions valued at $1.9 billion between now and 1992. Under the plan, that would result in total investment of about $4 billion.    The plan allows holders or purchasers of Argentine debt -- currently trading in secondary markets at 58% of its nominal value -- to convert the debt into local currency at par for the purpose of equity investment. The government said it would favor investment in export-oriented industries, plant construction, and new machinery.    Some analysts are skeptical of the plan because of the stipulation that each dollar of debt swapped must be matched by a new dollar of direct investment. But others say the program still could work. &quot;The arithmetic is still attractive,&quot; said Carlos Oris de Roa, an industrialist who suggested the plan could lead to investment of about $1 billion during the next 18 months.    If successful, officials say the program would more than double the rate of foreign investment in Argentina during the past five years, while stimulating a gradual opening of the country's highly protected economy. Juan Sommer, undersecretary for economic affairs, said there already is considerable interest in the program, particularly in the food, textile and petrochemical sectors. He didn't give further details.    Debt-equity conversions have been most successfully used in Chile, which hasn't insisted on the investment of one new dollar for every dollar of debt converted. Major U.S. creditor banks have shown increasing enthusiasm for such programs as a way to resolve Latin America's debt problem.    The creation of a debt-equity program was part of the $32.8 billion debt restructuring Argentina and its creditors agreed to in April. </TEXT></DOC>
