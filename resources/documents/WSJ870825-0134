Carnival said the 70,000 gross-registered-ton ships will each be capable of carrying 2,050 passengers. It said the delivery date for the first ship is tentatively set for early fall 1990, with the second vessel expected nine to 10 months later.    &quot;This order will represent the largest contract for passenger ship construction ever awarded,&quot; said Micky Arison, president of the company. An identical ship, already under construction at Wartsila, is scheduled to be ready in the fall of 1989, the company said.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Carnival shares closed at $15.75, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
