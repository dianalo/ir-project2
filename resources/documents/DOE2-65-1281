However, gas separation is a difficult and energy intensiveprocess. The development of new and innovative methodologies to selectivelyand efficiently separate specific gas components from mixed-gas streamswould significantly reduce the cost and complexity of product gas productionand processing. For example, efficient H/sub 2/ separation from synthesisgas could make coal an attractive future source of H/sub 2/ for use asa fuel or chemical feedstock. In addition, this technology could havea significant impact on processes not directly associated with coal gasificationin which hydrogen is lost in a waste stream. These processes includeammonia manufacture, reduction of metallic oxide ores, and hydrogenationof fats and oils. Thus, wide-ranging applications exist for hydrogenseparation and recovery technologies. The Pacific Northwest Laboratory(PNL) is examining transition-metal complexes as selective agents forthe separation of syngas components from gas mixtures. Transition-metalcomplexes are known which react reversibly with gases such as H/sub 2/,CO, O/sub 2/, and CO/sub 2/. This reversible binding can be used to transferthe gas from a region of high partial pressure to a region of lower partialpressure. The selectivity of transfer is determined primarily by theselectivity of the metal in binding a specific gas. The nature of theligands surrounding the metal has a large influence on the selectivityand reversibility and the authors have successfully used ligand modificationto prepare complexes that have improved properties for H/sub 2/ or CObinding. Applications of metal complexes to gas separation and two specificexamples of metal complexes under study are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
