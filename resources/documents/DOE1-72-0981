Such a system will incorporate significant parts of the knowledgeaccumulated by acknowledged experts in this field, as well as industryspecific information, and a sophisticated easy-to-use human interface.In addition, new knowledge about the information-requirements generationprocess can be obtained and documented by the knowledge-acquisition phaseof the expert system creation. IREX (Information Requirements EXpert)is a prototype expert system for generating business information requirements.It uses a variation of the BICS methodology which assumes the existenceof a finite set of generic models which can be customized for all businesses.IREX was implemented and tested on a microcomputer using the PROLOG language.The tests were conducted in a real world environment where specific informationrequirements were generated. Results show that the concepts behind IREXlend themselves very nicely to the expert-system approach.</TEXT></DOC>
