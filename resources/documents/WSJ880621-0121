Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy's escape from house arrest late Sunday and subsequent capture of the presidential palace and President Leslie Manigat capped days of maneuvering that on the surface seemed a clash between a civilian president and a restive military. In fact, Mr. Manigat held no real power, and several sources close to the military said the coup had more to do with private feuds within an army notorious for the way in which local commanders set themselves up as autonomous warlords, profiting from everything from smuggling drugs to illegally dumping toxic wastes from abroad.    Reports of casualties weren't confirmed, but sources close to the Haitian military said many soldiers were killed. Gen. Namphy declared himself president and Mr. Manigat was packed off to the Dominican Republic, his four-month tenure ended in a fashion typical of Haiti's sad history-amid blood and terror.    Mr. Manigat was elected in a fraud-riddled vote in January, six weeks after an earlier election had to be aborted because thugs allegedly linked to the army butchered about 40 Haitians as they waited to cast ballots.    The U.S. State Department immediately denounced the coup. &quot;Our policy in Haiti is to support democracy and civil rule,&quot; a spokeswoman said. The coup &quot;represents a severe setback for hopes for democracy in Haiti,&quot; she said.    &quot;This was a coup over spoils and personal animosity, not political principles,&quot; said one Haitian with good military contacts.    At the heart of the trouble was a collision between Gen. Namphy and Col. Jean Claude Paul, the much-feared commander of the 800 crack troops housed in barracks that sit just behind the national palace. Col. Paul was indicted in Miami last spring on cocaine-trafficking charges and has been accused of spearheading last year's election massacres.    After Col. Paul detained some of the general's troops last week, Gen. Namphy ordered the colonel to give up his command and take a desk job. The colonel refused. Mr. Manigat, whom political sources in Haiti said believed Col. Paul not only supported the president but was militarily stronger than Gen. Namphy, fired Gen. Namphy and placed him under house arrest on Saturday. On Sunday, Mr. Manigat also fired the commander of the presidential guard and several other officers close to Gen. Namphy.    Although details of the coup remain sketchy, sources close to the military said officers of the presidential guard then commandeered three tanks and freed Gen. Namphy, who was being held by Col. Paul's men at the general's ranch north of the capital. Gen. Namphy then stormed the presidential palace and later captured the president at his home. According to some sources, Col. Paul's brother, Alexander, was killed in the fighting.    Col. Paul's role in the coup is uncertain. Because of his superior firepower, elite troops and a large private army built from the remnants of the dreaded Ton-Ton Macoutes secret police, Col. Paul had been regarded as more than a match for Gen. Namphy. Yet he apparently kept many of his men in the barracks, and he appeared yesterday on Haiti's state television station with Gen. Namphy and a group of officers who support the general.    &quot;It would appear that at the last moment, he may have cut a deal,&quot; said one U.S. congressional source familiar with Col. Paul.    Many Haitians believe more bloodshed is virtually certain. &quot;Col. Paul and Gen. Namphy cannot coexist,&quot; said one former Haitian officer. Added Roger Biamby, a Haitian exile leader in Miami: &quot;The power structure in Haiti has become completely criminal, and the losers, as always, are the Haitian people who are being cut down every day.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
