In the federal capital of Bonn, air force Maj. Gen.Klaus-Wilhelm Rimmek resigned. He had been criticized for allowingan officers' party to be held hours after the tragedy on Aug. 28.   More than 200 people were injured at the air show at the U.S.Air Force base at Ramstein when three planes in an Italian airforce stunt team collided and one crashed in flames into the crowd.   Rimmek, the first person to quit as a result of the tragedy,acknowledged he allowed the ``Fliers' Ball'' to go on as scheduledin Noervenich, near Cologne, even though he was informed earlier ofthe Ramstein catastrophe.   ``Sure, they had a moment of silence at 10 p.m., but then theswinging and swaying just kept right on going,'' said AlfredBiehle, a member of a parliamentary committee investigating thecrash. Biehle is a member of the Christian Social Union party ofBavaria.   Juergen Dietzen, a spokesman for Rhineland-Palatinate statewhere the Ramstein base is located, said the state has startedmaking emergency payments to help victims and survivors.   He gave no amount, but said the state made the first paymentsfrom federal funds to aid the victims and the federal governmentwould provide further compensation for personal injuries andproperty damage.   Dietzen told The Associated Press, ``Three more people havedied'' and said two were West German men in their 40s and a girl.He gave no details.   Dietzen said 157 people were still hospitalized Friday, with 25to 30 in critical condition ``and some of them are in danger ofdying.''   Officials gave this breakdown by nationality of the dead: 52West Germans, a U.S. soldier and her nine-year-old son, one Frenchcitizen, a Dutch citizen and the three Italian pilots.   More than 300,000 people were attending the air show.   Federal lawmakers in Bonn have begun an investigation.   Erwin Horn, a defense spokesman for the opposition SocialDemocrats, said he doubted Christian Democratic Defense MinisterRupert Scholz had adequately carried out his ``supervisory duties.''</TEXT></DOC>
