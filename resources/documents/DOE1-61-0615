Since, with rareexceptions, exposure levels present in the workplace far exceed thosefound in the general community, the health effects of existing technologiesare most easily discovered by study of occupationally exposed individuals.As a consequence, this chapter will largely focus on methods of detectionof occupationally induced illness. Nonetheless, the number of individualsin the general community who are exposed to various substances may exceedby far the number of occupationally exposed individuals. The authors,therefore, give some consideration in the final section to the possibilityof detecting adverse health effects among members of the general community.By existing technologies, we will refer to large manufacturing and extractiveindustries, for example, the mining, petrochemical, automobile, and steelindustries. The authors will not catalog the known health effects ofthese various industries. Rather the interest of this chapter is methodologic.They are concerned with both excess mortality and morbidity associatedwith toxic exposures. The chapter is presented largely in the form ofa logic argument concerning the potential for epidemiologic studies ofhuman populations to provide the scientific data base necessary for theprevention of environmentally induced disease. The basic argument isoutlined.</TEXT></DOC>
