There were also right-wing calls for retaliation if any Israelicaptives were harmed. Rafael Eytan, an ex-chief of staff, said thatif pro-Iranian guerrillas carried out a threat to kill a capturedIsraeli soldier, Israel should retalitate by executing ``10 oftheirs.''   Israel officials said those remarks carried no authority and didnot represent the views of the government.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, speaking on the CBS ``Face theNation'' program Sunday, said Israel would not accept dealing onlyfor the 16 Western hostages.   Avi Pazner, a top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said:``It is obvious we will not agree to a partial exchange.''   An Israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity saidIsrael would not even start negotiations unless Israeli prisonerswere part of the deal.   Israeli officials said, however, that while diplomatic contactswere being made, no official negotiations had begun and Israel hadnot yet been delivered any demands through the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross.   Asked about the threat made by a Shiite leader, Hussein Mousawi,to kill an Israeli soldier, Liel said Israeli policy was to holdIran and Syria responsible for the safety of the prisoners.   ``We see Hezbollah and countries that are its patrons asresponsible for the fate and safety of the hostages,'' said Liel.   Officials said Iran provides money and guidance to Hezbollah,the umbrella for Shiite groups believed to be holding hostages inLebanon. Syria, they noted, controlled the territory on whichhostages were held and could put military pressure on the groups.   Ehud Olmert, the Cabinet minister responsible for Arab affairs,said there would be a ``reaction'' if Israeli POWs were harmed buthe declined to give details, saying that could be harmful tonegotiations.   In addition to the 150 Lebanese and 300 Palestinian prisoners,Hezbollah wants Israel to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a LebaneseShiite clergyman with ties to Hezbollah who was kidnapped fromsouthern Lebanon by Israeli troops on July 28.   Olmert reiterated that Israel would not free Obeid unlessIsraeli prisoners were part of an exchange.   Israeli spokesmen said their comments were statements of policyand not in response to Hezbollah's offer to free U.S. hostageJoseph Cicippio for Obeid and the Arab prisoners.   ``I don't think we should relate to each and every statement theHezbollah is making,'' Pazner said when asked about the offer.   Another official said of the various messages from Lebanon: ``Wedon't know how authorized those statements are.''   Eytan, who commanded Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon,suggested Israel should kidnap additional Shiite leaders if morebargaining chips were needed for a prisoner swap.   ``We have one good bargaining card,'' Eytan said on Israelradio, referring to Obeid. ``If one card is not enough, we have togo in one night and bring back a few more cards, and again the nextnight. If they threaten, we'll threaten back. Lebanon is a box fullof cards.''   ``If they God forbid execute one of our people, we have to kill10 of theirs,'' Eytan added.   Israel army radio quoted Geula Cohen, a legislator of theright-wing Tehiya party, as calling on Rabin to put Obeid on trialand demand the death penalty if any Israeli soldiers are harmed.   Cohen also criticized the government for proposing to releaseall the Shiite prisoners held by Israel. She said a lopsided swapin 1985 in which 1,050 Arabs were released for three Israeli POWsplanted the seeds for the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank andGaza Strip.   According to unofficial estimates, Israel holds about 400Shiites. More than 8,000 Palestinians are in Israeli jails inconnection with the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising.   Army spokesman declined comment on a CBS report that Israelitroops were on alert along the northern border following a threatto Israeli captives. the situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
