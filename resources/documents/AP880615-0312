SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The working mother has made the transitionfrom novelty to national norm, with more than half of new mothersremaining in the job market for the first time, the Census Bureaureported Wednesday.   ``Every time a statistic approaches the 50 percent mark of thelabor force, it's not an oddity anymore, it's a way of life,'' saidMartin O'Connell, chief of the bureau's Fertility Statistics Branch.   The labor force participation rate for new mothers climbed to50.8 percent last year from 49.8 percent in 1986, marking the firsttime a majority of women reported they were working or activelyseeking employment within a year of giving birth.   By comparison, only 31 percent of new mothers were counted inthe labor force in 1976, the first year the Census Bureau sought tocalculate this rate.   O'Connell noted that the share of new mothers remaining in theworkforce has grown steadily over the last decade, a result ofwomen's increasing propensity to delay marriage and childbearing infavor of jobs and education.   Women who accumulate more years of schooling and work experiencebefore having children have ``greater financial resources to enablethem, once they have a child, to obtain child-care services and getback to the labor force much quicker,'' O'Connell explained in atelephone interview.   In addition, they have ``increased career commitment andincreased cost of staying out of the labor force, compared to an18- or 19-year-old who had a child earlier'' in life, he said.   O'Connell pointed to findings that 68 percent of women who hadtheir first child at age 30 or over remained in the job market,compared with 54 percent of those age 18 to 24.   For new mothers with college degrees, the job rate was 63percent, well above the 38 percent rate for those whose educationended during high school.   The new study, ``Fertility of American Women: June 1987,'' alsodisclosed a substantial increase in the number of two-earnerfamilies with children. It concentrated on women age 18 to 44, thenormal childbearing ages.   The increasing share of mothers returning to jobs led to a totalof 13.4 million two-worker families with children last year, upfrom 8.3 million in 1976.   The number of childless couples with both husband and wifeemployed and the wife of childbearing age increased from 3.0million to 4.3 million over the 11-year period.   ``A lot has been said about DINKS (dual-income, no-kidsfamilies) ... (and) given the attention, one would be led to thinkthere are many more than there actually are,'' O'Connell said.   ``The real story is the number of dual-employed couples wherethey have a child ... that's the big nesws that's been happeningthe last 10 years,'' said O'Connell.   At 13.4 million, dual-earner couples with children make up morethan 40 percent of all married couples in the childbearing ages,O'Connell pointed out.   That, he added, means that American businesses will have to payclose attention to the needs of these workers and families.   O'Connell addressed the topic last year in a separate, privatelypublished analysis, ``Juggling Jobs and Babies: America's ChildCare Challenge.''   That report, which he said remains valid, warned that smallernumbers of people born in recent years means fewer workersavailable, making it harder for business to replace experiencedwomen who have children.   The result will be a need to cope with the needs of workingmothers, including such possibilities as flexible work schedules,employer-sponsored child care, flexible benefit plans and other newapproaches, he wrote.   Other findings of the new Census Bureau study included:   _The national birth rate for the 12 months ended in June 1987was 71 births per 1,000 women age 18 to 44, up slightly from therate of 70.3 per 1,000 a year earlier. The rate was 68.5 for whitewomen, 83.2 for black women and 95.8 for Hispanic women. It was95.0 for married women, 38.1 for single women and 23.5 for womenwho were widowed or divorced.   _Labor force participation among new mothers was 53 percent forblacks, 51 percent for whites and 36 percent for Hispanics.   _Widowed, divorced and separated mothers were most likely to beworking, at 66 percent. Married women were second at 49.8 percent,followed by single mothers at 49.5 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
