The nominee, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,stopped short of saying he would reverse the administration'sposition, which prohibits universities to fund and administerscholarships granted on the basis of race.</LP><TEXT>   But during his confirmation hearing before the SenateLabor Committee, Mr. Alexander said the administration'spolicy &quot;sent out exactly the wrong signal. Our signal todisadvantaged students, especially minorities, is we want youin, not out.&quot;   Mr. Alexander, 50-year-old president of the University ofTennessee, is expected to be confirmed easily by the fullSenate. As chairman of the National Governors' Association inthe mid-1980s, he led state education reform efforts and inhis own state won passage of a so-called better schoolsprogram that included merit pay for teachers, more classroomuse of computers and tougher mathematics and sciencerequirements.   The administration's position on minority scholarships hasaroused ire and confusion among colleges and universities,which contend that special scholarship pools are critical toensure that minority students have access to highereducation.   The controversy began when an Education Departmentofficial sent a letter Dec. 4 to organizers of the FiestaBowl college football game saying their plan to create a$100,000 scholarship fund for black students was illegal. Afew days later, the administration backpedaled and saidrace-exclusive scholarships were acceptable as long as theywere privately funded and not financed or administered by theuniversities themselves.   If confirmed, Mr. Alexander said that &quot;in my first two orthree days in office, I'd announce that we're starting overand going back to the policy that existed Dec. 3,&quot; whichdidn't explicitly bar race-exclusive scholarships. Then hesaid he would study the situation and come up with a policythat ensures opportunity and diversity but avoids quotas.   Though Mr. Alexander got a warm reception from the Senatepanel, President Bush's performance in fulfilling hiscampaign pledge to be &quot;the education president&quot; hasn't.   A number of senators disapprove of the fiscal 1992 budgetthe White House submitted to Congress this week because itfails to increase education spending enough to fund thecurrent level of services.   &quot;The budget we've just received doesn't show a priorityfor education,&quot; said Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill).   Mr. Alexander declined to discuss the issue because hedidn't help formulate the budget.   He also said he doesn't yet have a plan for reaching thesix national education goals -- drawn up by President Bushand the nation's governors -- which include wiping outilliteracy and making U.S. students first in the world inmathematics and science by 2000.   Meanwhile, the Senate Labor Committee unanimously approvedthe nomination of former Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois forLabor Secretary. The action cleared the way for a Senateconfirmation vote on Mrs. Martin, who is expected to becomethe only woman heading a cabinet department in theadministration.   The panel voted 17-0 to confirm Mrs. Martin. In her recentconfirmation hearing, she was widely endorsed by committeemembers; Democrats praised her for voting in favor ofminimum-wage and parental-leave bills that went against theadministration's stand.</TEXT></DOC>
