And now President Bush's ambitious arms controlinitiatives will be put to the test.   Indeed, as Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Thursday,the ball is in the Soviets' court and ``a response by them is nowclearly called for.''   Bush's proposals for ceilings on troops, tanks, combat aircraftand attack helicopters, artillery and armored personnel carriersrefine what NATO put on the bargaining table in Vienna in March.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev responded last month withhis own blueprint for drastic cuts.   But Bush's proposals change the picture in the East-West talksagain. For the first time, for instance, NATO is willing tonegotiate over combat airplanes.   The Soviets, presumably, will have to deal with that issue.Defining what is a combat craft is difficult. And Gorbachev isbound to have his own version of what kind of aerial cutbacksshould be made.   The Soviet leader also may push for reductions in Western navalforces. And it would be amazing if he did not try to trim or eveneliminate British and French troop concentrations in West Germany.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in an initialreaction Wednesday in Paris, said those 100,000 forces couldcomplicate the quest for an accord.   This had echoes of the fight two years ago over Pershingmissiles in West Germany that were partly under U.S. control.   It threatened to hold up a treaty to ban U.S. and Sovietmedium-range missiles.   The Reagan administration argued the negotiations did notinvolve West Germany. Finally, there was a compromise in which theWest Germans volunteered to destroy the missiles.   Bush, outlining his plan in Brussels, said it should be possibleto complete a treaty in six months to a year.   It would be carried out by 1992 or 1993, at the latest, underthe Bush timetable.   Shevardnadze said he was ``pessimistic'' about Bush's timetable.   Baker was not about to contradict his boss, especially on thepresident's best week in office.   ``It was optimistic, but not unrealistic,'' Baker said.   But he acknowledged there are lots of questions for NATO to workout before the proposal is put on the table in Vienna.   These, he said, include finding ways to verify that thereductions are carried out and dealing with the equipment theUnited States would like to keep stored in Europe after tens ofthousands of troops are withdrawn.   Baker also said there are questions about the extent to whichtroops must be demobilized and deactivated.   Responding to Shevardnadze on British and French troops, hesaid, ``I suppose we will have an interest in knowing what happensto other Warsaw Pact troops other than Soviet troops.''   The pace of arms control has quickened since Gorbachev tookpower in 1985.   The United States and the Soviet Union signed an unprecedentedtreaty in 1987 to destroy all their medium-range nuclear missiles.   By pushing hard on a number of fronts, the Soviet leader hasforced Bush to abandon his cautious stance and come up with his ownwide-ranging plan.   But that does not mean the problems of pursuing disarmament goaway.   Just remember: East and West negotiated for 15 years to reducetheir forces in Central Europe. The talks eventually collapsed.   And now NATO and the Warsaw Pact are dealing with all of Europeand a much wider range of weapons.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid, the head of the AP's StateDepartment staff, has covered arms control for 16 years.</TEXT></DOC>
