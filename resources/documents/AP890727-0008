A veteran of one of the world's most lenient penal systems,where early releases are routine, Pettersson's criminal recordlists more than 60 crimes, most of them petty theft and assault,one for manslaughter.   ``I am a killer but not a murderer,'' he said as his five-weektrial opened June 5. He maintained he was innocent of shootingPalme on Feb. 28, 1986.   ``I was a bum,'' he told the court. ``It's actually surprisingthat anyone at all has anything positive to say about me.''   The 42-year-old unemployed Swede was arrested in December andlater charged with the murder.   The trial revealed a life of drug use, alcohol abuse and pettycrime. It exposed the complex character of a Bible-reading lonerwho liked children, wrote poetry and scared friends with hiserratic, violent behavior.   Pettersson was born into a middle-class family on April 23,1947. A promising child, he read Homer at the age of 10 and had noevident problems in school until suffering a concussion as ateenager.   At 19, he started taking drugs. His life took a criminal turnand developed into a roller coaster of euphoria, jails and mentalhospitals.   Pettersson studied acting in the 1960s, but dropped out ofacting school after being accused of theft.   There were conflicting accounts of his political views _ or ofwhether he had any.   During the trial, he described himself as an admirer of Palme.The four-term prime minister was a champion of social democraticcauses and a leading architect of Sweden's welfare state.   After the slaying, Pettersson signed several public letters ofcondolence.   However, friends testified that Pettersson bore a deep hatredtoward Sweden's highly structured society, where drugs are nottolerated and drinking is officially discouraged.   Newspapers speculated that he developed a hatred for Palme in1980 after contacts in jail with a right-wing extremist.   In 1970, Pettersson escaped from a mental hospital, got into anargument with a stranger and killed him with a bayonet.   The slaying occurred close to where Palme was gunned down 16years later. Evidence at the time indicated that Pettersson fledthe scene down a small side street, the same one taken by Palme'skiller.   Pettersson was convicted of manslaughter, held in a psychiatricward and released after seven months.</TEXT></DOC>
