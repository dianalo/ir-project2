Now, that earlier effort in PCs is gathering momentum --in the wrong direction.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This has to be the greatest disaster in IBM's history,&quot;says George Colony, president of Forrester Research Inc., aconsulting firm. &quot;The reverberations will be felt throughoutthe decade.&quot;   How IBM managed to shunt a comeback train onto a sidetracklargely explains the growing urgency and widening sweep ofChairman John F. Akers's promises of change. Mr. Akers hadalready attempted a decentralization in 1988, rewritten a lotof rules through this summer's startling alliance with AppleComputer Inc. and cut tens of thousands of jobs.   However, his latest plan goes even further. It seeks tosplit IBM into numerous businesses and raises the prospectthat those failing to measure up will be sold. It also seeksto prevent the sort of disaster that goes under the name ofOS/2, IBM's operating-system software for personal computers.But the OS/2 saga shows how hard it will be for IBM tochange.   Despite the technical overtones, OS/2 is really amanagement problem. It shows IBM's bureaucracy at its mostarthritic and how Big Blue throws billions of dollars atproblems that can't be solved with money. It shows how IBMclings to the idea that it must control every part of themarket, even though the company must relinquish that heritageif it is to be as flexible as Mr. Akers's latest planrequires.   Nonetheless, IBM's developers can eventually solve eventhe toughest technical problems -- but sometimes too late tomake a difference in the marketplace.   Asked about the prospects for OS/2, Scott McNealy, chiefexecutive of workstation maker Sun Microsystems Inc., atfirst stares slack-jawed and then says: &quot;OS/2? That one'salready buried. There's grass growing over the grave.&quot;   That's not how IBM executives see it. They contend thatthe problems are temporary, that software projects take timeand that OS/2 will take off when a new version becomesavailable next March. They say OS/2 is so good it may enticecustomers to buy the more-powerful computers needed to runit, lifting the PC business out of a rut. And they note thatsuccessful software is highly profitable.   &quot;We are not in business to lose money,&quot; says JosephGuglielmi, an IBM vice president responsible for OS/2marketing.   The OS/2 problem takes the form of a race with MicrosoftCorp. that IBM could have won but is losing by miles.Narrowly at stake is the $1 billion-a-year market for theoperating-system software that controls the basic functionsof personal computers. But whoever leads that market canshape the future of PCs and the &quot;applications software&quot; --the programs that make them useful. That means a head startin reaching a projected $40 billion-a-year market with newmachines and applications using the dominant operatingsystem. Everyone else will play catch-up.   For IBM, the recent efforts to push OS/2 as hard aspossible also represent an attempt to recover amultibillion-dollar investment, restore its credibility withbewildered customers and satisfy its corporate pride bywinning a fight that is becoming extremely personal. Successwith OS/2 might even convince investors that IBM can innovateenough with software that it won't soon have to make anotherpainful announcement like that last week.   Even though IBM popularized the personal computer, salesof its OS/2 operating system are trailing Microsoft's rivalWindows system by 15 to 1. Based on figures supplied by IBMand software-industry executives who have worked with it, IBMappears to have spent nearly $2.5 billion over the past sixyears developing OS/2 and applications that run with it. Forall that, IBM has collected perhaps $100 million of revenue.Work on OS/2 alone has cost IBM some $850 million.   Because of the way IBM accounts for development costs,some $800 million of that $2.5 billion has yet to be treatedas expenses and will weigh on earnings for several years. IBMis still investing some $350 million a year on the project.   Even those numbers, however, don't fully explain IBM'sproblems with OS/2. Linking OS/2 to the company's PS/2 lineof personal computers also contributed to the decline inIBM's PC market share to about 20% today from nearly 40% in1986, the year before OS/2 was announced. That cost: $8billion a year in revenue.   In addition, OS/2 hurt IBM's credibility with softwaredevelopers, who market researchers say spent more than $1billion developing applications for OS/2. How much revenuedid those applications bring in? &quot;Zip,&quot; says Tim Farrell,president of Future Soft Engineering Inc., which made someOS/2 products.   The OS/2 problems go back to 1985, when IBM decided it hadto fend off the clones. It chose to go its own way in PChardware and software. It hoped to set new standards and putpressure on clone makers and to regain control of its destinyby doing the software on its own. But when IBM told Microsoftthat their five-year relationship was over, Microsoft'scofounder, Bill Gates, appealed to IBM's chief executive, Mr.Akers. Mr. Gates won a reversal at a luncheon in June 1986.   The companies' ideas differed, however. Microsoft startedout from a PC perspective, with Windows serving as the base.IBM brought mainframe ideas to the process -- including theidea that hordes of IBM software and hardware people shouldhave a say in how OS/2 was developed.   Managing by committee has long hobbled IBM, where anymember of the group can call a halt by saying he or she&quot;nonconcurs.&quot; An allegorical memo circulating among IBMdevelopers says IBM lost a rowing race to Microsoft because,some IBM task forces found, Microsoft had eight people rowingand one steering while IBM had eight steering and one rowing.The task forces' recommendation? The one rower should rowharder. Eventually, he was fired for poor performance.   Although small, tightly integrated teams do best atdeveloping software, IBM and Microsoft wound up with 1,700programmers working at three sites on two continents. Theresult: a product far too complicated for mere mortals touse; far too big to run on many of the computers that IBMintroduced together with OS/2 in April 1987; and far toorevolutionary. Users wanted to move ahead in little steps andnot have to trash all their current hardware and software.   To Microsoft, the problems with OS/2 persuaded it toreturn to Windows. Windows would provide many of the nicetouches that make Apple's Macintosh so easy to use. It wouldalso work together with -- and not replace -- the DOSoperating system already on the tens of millions ofIBM-compatible computers. Microsoft saw Windows as an interimstep that would eventually lead customers to OS/2. IBMthought Windows would undercut OS/2.   In November 1989 in Las Vegas, Nev., the two companiesscheduled a fateful dinner on the Sunday night before the bigComdex trade show began. They told the industry's 30 majorsoftware executives that they had patched up theirdifferences: Windows would be positioned for less powerfulcomputers, OS/2 for more powerful ones.   But Jim Cannavino, who runs IBM's PC business, apparentlybecame uncomfortable as he heard people talk of how IBM hadfinally endorsed Windows. At the companies' joint pressconference that Tuesday, he managed only anemic praise forWindows. Afterward, Microsoft executives bristled when theyread that software rivals such as Jim Manzi, chief executiveof Lotus Development Corp., interpreted the agreement as theemasculation of Windows. So Mr. Gates and Microsoft beganputting more and more emphasis on pushing Windows hard.   When Microsoft introduced another version of Windows inMay 1990, the software went from a steady seller to ajuggernaut. Windows has now sold more than seven millioncopies, compared with only 800,000 for OS/2 -- and 300,000 ofthose OS/2 sales are in dispute. Microsoft says that IBM gavethe copies away as part of a sale of memory boards and thatthey were never used. IBM disagrees heatedly. IBM alsodislikes the way Microsoft abandoned OS/2 this year; itthinks Microsoft reneged on a commitment that would haveensured OS/2's eventual success.   &quot;We were appalled,&quot; says Lee Reiswig, an IBM OS/2development official.   As the companies began to go their separate ways, thepersonal frictions increased. IBM executives, accustomed topolite debate, resent what Microsoft's own executives callMr. Gates's machine-gun style. When he disagrees, no matterwith whom or in what setting, he fires questions -- Whatabout this? What about that? -- until his opponent wilts.   People in the industry add that IBM feels it createdMicrosoft, which consisted of 32 people before IBM decided 10years ago to use Microsoft's DOS operating system on theoriginal IBM PC. And IBM executives say they are tired ofreading about Mr. Gates's brilliance and billions.   Many industry executives say IBM should have cut itslosses on OS/2 and moved on. In fact, IBM acknowledges thatit did take a hard look at the project. But Mr. Cannavinosays the company decided the original concepts were stillsound. In addition, IBM had been pushing OS/2 so hard withits customers that it felt obliged to continue.   At the end of last year, IBM did disband much of a huge,related project, called OfficeVision, that had tried to beall things to all people across entire companies but that hadhit technical and management problems. So, IBM's credibilityin PC software was at an all-time low when IBM announced inApril that it was going to make its biggest push yet on OS/2.   Its pride stung, IBM assembled customers, softwaredevelopers and industry analysts for day-long sessions.People who attended say Mr. Akers and IBM President JackKuehler laid their reputations on the line, vowing that OS/2would be delivered by year end. Even though many observersconsidered the goals too aggressive, these people say Mr.Akers told some senior IBM executives, such as Mr. Reiswig,that he would have their badges if they failed. And Mr.Cannavino growled to software developers that if they had anytrouble with Microsoft, they should call him and he wouldpersonally take care of it. (IBM executives say some of thestories are exaggerated but aren't more specific.)   The soft-spoken Mr. Reiswig has taken to calling himself&quot;the Blue Ninja&quot; to show the ferocity with which IBM intendsto push OS/2. At trade shows, he often wears -- over hisbutton-down, white shirt -- a T-shirt with a Ninja warrior onit. He signs himself &quot;the Blue Ninja&quot; on IBM's internalelectronic-mail network.   The pressure has won some converts, but IBM's fumblingattempts to stay on the cutting edge are damaging itscredibility again. The IBM-Apple deal last summer made somecustomers wonder whether OS/2 wasn't just IBM's operatingsystem &quot;du jour,&quot; which they would be urged to replace inthree years with something better. Earlier, IBM had spentsome $60 million on a deal with Steve Jobs's Next Inc. forsome avant garde software. Last year, IBM formed a softwareventure with Metaphor Computer Systems Inc. to addresssimilar issues and spent $10 million on that. Neither planwent anywhere.   IBM further damaged its credibility this fall by admittingfailure with its Desktop Software group, an attempt to buythe rights to leading-edge software packages that were tomake IBM a factor in the PC software market.   Then came the big one. IBM delayed OS/2 from the end ofthis year until next March because it wanted to add morefunctions. Given its promise of a death march to get OS/2 outand its denials right up to the last minute that it washaving problems, even some loyal IBM customers wonder what isgoing on.   &quot;In the big scheme of things, the deadline they missedisn't a catastrophe,&quot; says Larry Bacon, a senior vicepresident at Travelers Corp. and long an OS/2 advocate. But&quot;if they miss another one, well, how many strikes do theyget?&quot;   IBM has, in fact, made admirable progress on the technicalside on OS/2. It has apparently even solved some problems sothorny that many considered them unsolvable. It also cancount on many big customers to stay with it. If IBM meets itsMarch deadline, it may also have nine months to a year inwhich OS/2 will have features unavailable from Microsoft,whose Windows NT will probably reach the market late nextyear or in early 1993.   A year might give IBM breathing room, and it is trying toexploit its advantage by lining up as many softwareapplications for OS/2 as possible. But none of theapplications on the horizon will give OS/2 the sort ofadvantage Apple's Macintosh had a few years ago when it had amonopoly on good desktop-publishing software.   Besides, Microsoft's success with software developersdwarfs IBM's. IBM talks of having more than 800 applicationsavailable next year; Windows already has 4,900. WhenMicrosoft held a conference for Windows developers recentlyin Seattle, more than 2,000 showed up -- so many that, whenMicrosoft wanted them to walk half a dozen blocks to aspecial session, it had to get a parade permit from thepolice.   &quot;DOS and Windows are going to own the desktop,&quot; said FredGibbons, chief executive of Software Publishing Corp., aformer OS/2 supporter that has switched to developing forWindows.   Last year, a new trade magazine on PC operating systemscalled itself OS/2. Later, the name became Windows and OS/2.When CMP Publications bought the magazine this summer, itchanged the name again -- to Windows.</TEXT></DOC>
