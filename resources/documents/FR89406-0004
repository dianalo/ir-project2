In addition to increasing the time for thecollection and return of a check, delayed disbursement often increasesthe costs to process and transport the check. Delayed disbursement practicesnot only reduce the efficiency of the check collection system, but mayalso increase the risk to the depositary bank because the delay may resultin a check being returned after funds must be made available for withdrawalunder the Expedited Funds Availability Act (``Act'') and the Board's RegulationCC (12 CFR Part 229). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Regulation CC defines ``bank'' to include all depositaryinstitutions, including commercial banks, savings and loan associations,and credit unions. A depositary bank is defined as the first bank to whicha check is transferred. A paying bank is a bank by, at, or through whicha check is payable and to which it is sent for collection. <ITAG tagnum="84">Delayed Disbursement of Teller's Checks </ITAG>Although many classes of checks are subject to delayed disbursement, theeffects of delayed disbursement are particularly significant in the caseof teller's checks.\2\<NOTE/> Many banks issue teller's checks in lieu of cashier's checks(i.e., checks a bank draws on itself). These banks believe that, due tospecialization and economies of scale, certain banks and other serviceproviders can perform the tracking, reconciliation, and payment of teller'schecks at a lower cost than the issuing bank would incur by issuing andpaying cashier's checks. In addition, in certain cases, based on the locationof the paying bank vis-a-vis the issuing banks,\3\<NOTE/> the issuing bank can accrue float benefits from the delayeddisbursement of these checks.\4\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Regulation CC defines a ``teller's check'' as a checkprovided to a customer of a bank, or acquired from a bank for remittancepurposes, that is drawn by the bank and drawn on another bank or payablethrough or at another bank. For the purposes of the proposed amendmentsto Regulation CC as well as this policy statement, ``teller's check'' includeschecks drawn on a Federal Reserve Bank or a Federal Home Loan Bank. RegulationCC defines ``cashier's check'' as a check provided to a customer of a bank,or acquired from a bank for remittance purposes, that is drawn on the bank,is signed by an officer or employee of the bank on behalf of the bank asdrawer, and is a direct obligation of the bank. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Based on a recent Federal Reserve Bank survey, staff estimatesthat approximately 60 to 80 percent of teller's and cashier's checks aredeposited in a bank that is located in the same state as the issuing bank.Thus, when banks issue teller's checks that are payable at a location distantfrom the issuing bank, the depositary bank is also generally distant fromthe paying bank. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ In some cases, the issuing bank does not remit funds tothe paying bank until the day of presentment. In other cases, the issuingbank remits funds to the paying bank before the check is presented. Suchfunds may be held in a compensating balance account by the paying bankuntil the check is presented for payment. Earnings from the compensatingbalance account may be used to offset fees for teller's check services.The Act requires a depositary bank to provide customers with next-day availability,under specified conditions, for certain checks, including cashier's checksand teller's checks, deposited in transaction accounts. Regulation CC extendsthis next-day availability requirement to checks drawn on Federal ReserveBanks and Federal Home Loan Banks, because these checks have a low riskof return and are often used as a substitute for teller's checks. Dependingon the location of the paying bank, a depositary bank may not receive creditfor the check by the time funds must be made available to the customerfor withdrawal. Thus, the practice of delayed disbursement permits a bankissuing such checks to impose costs, in terms of lost interest, on otherbanks and to benefit from interest or earnings credits earned on outstandingchecks until the checks are presented for collection. <ITAG tagnum="84">Previous Board Actions </ITAG>Prior to enactment of the Act, the Board's ability to address delayed disbursementabuses was limited to discouraging such practices through policy statements\5\<NOTE/> and Federal Reserve Bank services, such as the High-DollarGroup Sort program. The Act authorizes the Board to make improvements tothe check system to speed the collection and return of checks and, thus,to restrict delayed disbursement practices. Specifically, the Act givesthe Board ``the responsibility to regulate any aspect of the payment system,including the receipt, payment, collection, or clearing of checks; andany related function of the payment system with respect to checks'' (12U.S.C. 4008(c)(1)). The Act also evidences the Congress' intent to speedthe availability of funds to bank depositors and, thus, suggests that areevaluation of delayed disbursement practices is appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ See policy statements issued by the Board on January 11,1979 and February 23, 1984. In December l987, the Board requested public comment on proposed RegulationCC as well as on proposals for long-term improvements to the check collectionsystem (52 FR 47176, December 11, 1987). A number of commenters on proposedRegulation CC cited the inequity of requiring the depositary bank to makethe proceeds of certain checks, including teller's checks, available forwithdrawal on the business day after deposit if the bank cannot receivecredit for the checks by that time. Some commenters recommended that theBoard restrict the next-day availability requirement to checks for whichthe depositary bank can receive credit by the next business day. Such arestriction, however, would be inconsistent with the Act.With respect to longer term improvement in the check collection system,the Board requested comment on how to address delayed disbursement practicesand the practice of issuing teller's checks payable in a different checkprocessing region than that of the issuing bank. The majority of commentsthat addressed this issue indicated that the practice of issuing teller'schecks payable in a different check processing region should be eliminated.Several other commenters (primarily providers of teller's check services)opposed any regulatory action to limit the location of the paying bank.After an analysis of the comments, the Board issued for comment in June1988 a proposed amendment to Regulation CC to restrict certain delayeddisbursement practices, with a proposed effective date of April 1, 1989(53 FR 24093, June 27, 1988). Under the proposal, a bank that issued teller'schecks would be required to draw the checks on or designate the checkspayable through or at a bank such that a depositary bank located in thesame community as the issuing bank would generally receive credit for thecheck as quickly as it would receive credit on a check drawn on the issuingbank. This proposed ``equivalent availability'' rule was based on the actualcheck collection practices of banks in the issuing bank's community. TheBoard did not believe it was practical to address the cases in which teller'schecks are deposited in banks distant from the issuing bank, such thatthe depositary banks are unable to receive next-day credit for the checks,even though the depositary banks must make the funds available for withdrawalon the next business day. For those checks deposited in a bank local tothe issuing bank, the proposed rule was designed to ensure that depositarybanks generally would receive credit for the teller's check by the nextbusiness day, when the funds must be made available for withdrawal. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment on Delayed Disbursement Proposal </ITAG>The Board received over 230 written comments from the public, and Boardstaff held numerous informal conversations with industry representativesregarding the effects of the proposal. Over 75 percent of the commenterssupported the Board's objective to restrict the delayed disbursement ofteller's checks; however, commenters indicated that the proposed rule wasunclear and would be difficult to administer. Commenters expressed particularconcerns about how issuers of teller's checks and providers of teller'scheck services could determine whether banks in a given community collectedchecks such that the availability of the teller's checks would be equivalentto the availability the banks receive on checks drawn on the issuing bank.As an alternative to the proposal, some commenters suggested that a cutoffhour, such as a Federal Reserve deposit deadline, be established such thata check deposited by the depositary bank for collection at or after thecutoff hour would receive next-day credit. Several commenters indicatedthat a combination of Federal Reserve and correspondent deadlines shouldbe referenced to determine whether an issuing bank could issue teller'schecks of a particular service provider. Other commenters suggested thatthe delayed disbursement problem could be resolved, in large part, by requiringthat teller's checks be payable locally, or be encoded with a city routingnumber if payable nonlocally.\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Commenters also expressed concern regarding the proposedeffective date of April 1, 1989. Commenters indicated that the proposedrule would require many banks to replace existing teller's check stockor to change providers of teller's check services, thereby necessitatinga longer lead time than that provided in the proposal. In response to thesecomments, the Board issued a notice that should the Board adopt a rulerestricting the delayed disbursement of teller's checks, such a rule wouldnot be effective April 1, 1989, as published in the proposal. (54 FR 5495,February 3, 1989). The Board has reviewed the public comments received and has evaluated alternativemethods of dealing with the delayed disbursement of teller's checks. Ithas considered the costs of delayed disbursement on depositary banks andthe burdens on users of teller's check services that might occur shouldthe Board take regulatory action. The Board believes that by issuing apolicy statement it can avoid the rigidity of a regulation and still addressthe problem of intentional delay in the collection of teller's checks.The effectiveness of the policy statement, however, will depend on thecooperation of teller's check issuers and service providers. Discussionswith the major providers of teller's check services indicated that theyare willing to make changes that would speed the collection of checks inmarkets they serve. The Board has received commitments from a number ofmajor teller's check providers to make operational changes that would addressin large part the concerns that prompted the Board to propose amendmentsto Regulation CC to restrict the delayed disbursement of these checks.The Board favors cooperative solutions that do not require rigid regulationsand that demonstrate the industry's willingness to work toward paymentsystem improvements. Therefore, the Board is issuing a policy statementin lieu of adopting a final regulation restricting delayed disbursementpractices. The effectiveness of the policy statement, however, will dependon the cooperation of teller's check service providers and issuers of teller'schecks. The policy statement will be effective immediately, but the Boardrecognizes that many banks and service providers will need a longer leadtime to comply with the policy. The Board will monitor the industry's adherenceto the policy statement and delayed disbursement practices in general and,should abuses continue, will consider formal regulatory action. In light of the foregoing, the Board is issuing the following policy statement:<ITAG tagnum="85">Board Policy Statement on Delayed Disbursement of Teller's Checksand Cashier's Checks </ITAG>Delayed disbursement is the practice of issuing checks that are payableby, through, or at a bank\1\<NOTE/> located in a geographic area such that collection of thechecks is generally delayed. Although many classes of checks are subjectto delayed disbursement, the effects of delayed disbursement are particularlysignificant in the case of teller's checks.\2\<NOTE/> The delayed disbursement of teller's checks imposes floatcosts on the depositary bank, which must generally make the proceeds ofthese checks available for withdrawal on the business day following deposit.In addition, delayed disbursement often increases the costs to processand transport these checks. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Regulation CC defines ``bank'' to include all depositoryinstitutions, including commercial banks, savings and loan associations,and credit unions. A depositary bank is defined as the first bank to whicha check is transferred. A paying bank is a bank by, at, or through whicha check is payable and to which it is sent for collection. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Regulation CC defines a ``teller's check'' as a checkprovided to a customer of a bank, or acquired from a bank for remittancepurposes, that is drawn by the bank and drawn on another bank or payablethrough or at another bank. For the purposes of this policy statement,``teller's check'' includes checks drawn on a Federal Reserve Bank or aFederal Home Loan Bank. The Expedited Funds Availability Act (``Act'') and Regulation CC (12 CFRPart 229) require a depositary bank to provide customers with next-dayavailability, under specified conditions, for certain checks depositedin transaction accounts, including cashier's checks\3\<NOTE/> and teller's checks. Depending on the location of the payingbank, a depositary bank may not receive credit for the check by the timefunds must be made available to the customer for withdrawal. Thus, thepractice of delayed disbursement permits a bank issuing such checks toimpose costs, in terms of lost interest, on other banks and to benefitfrom interest or earnings credits earned on outstanding checks until thechecks are presented for payment. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Regulation CC defines ``cashier's check'' as a check providedto a customer of a bank, or acquired from a bank for remittance purposes,that is drawn on the bank, is signed by an officer or employee of the bankon behalf of the bank as drawer, and is a direct obligation of the bank.The Board recognizes that many banks that issue teller's checks benefitfrom the specialization and economies of scale of certain banks and otherservice providers that can perform the tracking, reconciliation, and paymentservices associated with teller's checks at a lower cost than the issuingbank would incur by issuing and paying cashier's checks. In addressingthe delayed disbursement problem, the Board believes that it is desirableto reduce the float created by the issuance of these checks while at thesame time minimize the disruption of efficient teller's check services.As a general matter, the Board believes that a depositary bank locatedin the same community as the bank that issues a teller's check should beable to receive next-day credit for the teller's check. The Board has determined,after review of Federal Reserve collection patterns and deposit deadlinesacross the country, that depositary banks in most areas generally can receivenext-day credit for checks that are encoded with a nonlocal city routingnumber\4\<NOTE/> and presented in a nonlocal Federal Reserve city. For checksthat are encoded with a nonlocal RCPC or country routing number and presentedin a nonlocal check processing region, credit is generally deferred byone or two days. The Board recognizes, however, that depositary banks locatedon the west coast generally may not be able to receive next-day availabilityfor checks presented in most nonlocal cities. In addition, in other isolatedareas of the country, next-day credit is generally not available for anycheck payable by a nonlocal paying bank. The Board recognizes that banksin these areas may benefit by having access to a centralized teller's checkservice provider. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ These checks are payable by banks located in the samecity as a Federal Reserve office. RCPC (``Regional Check Processing Center'')checks are payable by banks in areas designated within the territoriesof Federal Reserve offices but outside Federal Reserve cities. CertainFederal Reserve regions also contain country zones, which are generallymore remote from Federal Reserve cities than are RCPC zones. The Board believes that banks issuing teller's checks and teller's checkservice providers should take steps to ensure that delays in the collectionand return of teller's checks are kept to a minimum. First, the Board believesthat any disbursement practice designed to extend the time needed to collecta teller's check is inappropriate. Although the Board believes that centralizeddisbursement is economically efficient in some cases, the location of thepaying bank should be chosen so as to minimize collection time. Second, the Board has determined that depositary banks can generally receivecredit faster for checks payable by a bank with a city routing number thanfor checks payable by a bank with an RCPC or country routing number. TheBoard believes that teller's check service providers that serve issuingbanks in check processing regions that are nonlocal to the paying bankshould help speed the collection and return of teller's checks by use ofa city presentment point and a city routing number in the MICR line ofits teller's checks. Some teller's check service providers confine the scope of their servicesto a state or other limited geographic area. Because the state or areamay be divided into more than one check processing region, such serviceproviders may use a paying bank that is nonlocal to many of their customerbanks. In addition, the state or area may contain no Federal Reserve city.The Board recognizes that it may be impractical for such service providersto use a city presentment point. Third, the Board believes that those teller's check service providers thatserve banks nationwide should accept teller's checks at more than one presentmentpoint, particularly those providers that serve west coast banks. For example,a teller's check service provider that uses an east coast paying bank couldshorten collection and return times for its California customers by alsoproviding a west coast presentment point for teller's checks. The Board recognizes that similar delayed disbursement problems arise inconnection with cashier's checks, issued by a bank with multistate branches,that depositary banks must send to a central location for payment. TheBoard believes that the same general guidelines should apply to the disbursementof cashier's checks as apply to teller's checks and will take further actionregarding cashier's checks should abusive delayed disbursement practicescontinue to occur. The Board will monitor the industry's adherence to the policy statementand delayed disbursement practices in general and, should abuses continue,will consider formal regulatory action.<ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,March 3l, l989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William W.
