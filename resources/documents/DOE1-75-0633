A tentative identification of optimum reinforcement forms has beenmade for ceramic, metallic, and polymeric matrices: these are respectivelywhiskers and small-diameter platelets; small whiskers and thin platelets;and large-diameter fibers, whiskers, and large platelets. Attention isgiven to the forms of SiC obtainable by the process and the mechanicalproperties obtained for them to date.</TEXT></DOC>
