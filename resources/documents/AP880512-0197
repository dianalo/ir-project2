Police said at least oneguerrilla was wounded.   Six fighter-bombers took part in the eighth aerial attack onLebanon this year, police said.   The Israelis rocketed and destroyed three guerrilla commandposts in olive groves near the Kharroub region town of Barja inthree bombing runs, police said. Barja is 16 miles south of Beirut.   The raid began at 6:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes. The positionswere manned by guerrillas of the Popular Front for the Liberationof Paslestine-General Command, police said.   The group's 52-year-old commander, Ahmed Jibril, was inspectingthe Kharroub region at the time of the raid, but several guerrillassaid he was not hurt.   Jibril is a former Syrian army captain. His group is based inDamascus and gets financial support from Libya.   His fighters quickly cordoned off the stricken area and wouldnot allow reporters and photographers to inspect the damage.   But from Sidon, nine miles south of Barja, smoke could be seenbillowing from the groves.   In Israel, the military command said Israeli warplanes raidedguerrilla bases north of the southern port city of Sidon andreturned safely to their bases. The location would be in the samearea as the raids reported by Lebanese police.   Pilots reported accurate hits, said the brief communique.   Guerrillas fired at the planes with anti-aircraft guns, but nohits were reported, the Lebanese police said.   ``They appeared to have whisked their victims to a nearby fieldclinic of their own,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot be namedunder standing regulations.   ``We know of only one seriously wounded guerrilla. But there maybe more,'' he added.   The targeted group has claimed responsibility for an attack innorthern Israel last November by a guerrilla flying a motorizedhang glider. The guerrilla killed six Israeli soldiers and woundedeight before he was shot dead.   In retaliation, a squadron of 12 Israeli fighter-bombers raidedthree of the front's posts between around Barja on Jan. 3.   Police said at the time that 26 people were killed and 30wounded in that raid, the first on Lebanon in 1988.   In all, 49 people have been killed and 71 wounded in Israeli airraids on Lebanon. The last one was carried out by helicoptergunships against the south Lebanon village of Kabrikha on May 9.</TEXT></DOC>
