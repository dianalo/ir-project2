The solicitor general's office, which represents theexecutive branch before the high court, traditionallyperforms a special role as gatekeeper, helping the justicessort out which cases to review among the roughly 2,000appeals in which the federal government is involved eachyear.</LP><TEXT>   But lately, in an increasing number of cases, the courthas disregarded the solicitor general's suggestion on whetherto hear an appeal. In a few instances, the justices haveturned down appeals that the solicitor general urged them tohear; more often, the solicitor general has said an appealisn't important enough to merit one of the limited spaces onthe court's oral-argument calendar, but the court has agreedto hear the case anyway.   Three years ago, the court decided to hear 11 cases overthe solicitor general's opposition; two years ago, there weresix such cases; and last year, there were 13. In the court'scurrent term, the justices are deciding 15 cases despite thefederal government's opposition. Although this increase seemsslight, lawyers familiar with the office's history say thesefigures are higher than those of a decade ago, when therewere commonly no more than three or four a year.   No one is quite sure why the change is occurring, or whatto make of it, but it appears to be an important part of alarger puzzle about what is happening to the court's docket.For more than a year now, the justices have been grantinghearings to significantly fewer cases. The number is so lowthat the court filled its hearing calendar in only one of theseven two-week argument sessions of the current term, whichbegan last October.   With the number of cases being argued in the courtdeclining, it is even more curious that the number arguedover the solicitor general's opposition should be increasing.   One explanation may be that the justices are hungry forcases that they believe need their attention, and as aresult, are less likely to simply accept the solicitorgeneral's assertion that an appeal isn't deserving of oralargument.   An example is a tax dispute the court agreed in January toreview. The case raises the question of whether the U.S. TaxCourt has the authority to appoint special judges who arehandling thousands of tax cases. A federal appeals courtupheld the Tax Court's authority. When the taxpayers whobrought the case appealed, the solicitor general said thatthe appeals court was right, that there were no otherconflicting appeals court rulings, and there was no reasonfor the Supreme Court to hear the case. But the case will beargued on April 23.   In some appeals of cases that the government has won, thesolicitor general acknowledges that there are conflictingdecisions by federal appeals courts and acquiesces in thecourt's hearing argument. Those cases are almost alwaysgranted review by the justices. But in others, the solicitorgeneral may acknowledge conflicting interpretations of afederal law, while insisting, nevertheless, that the issueisn't an important one.   Carter Phillips, a Washington lawyer and former assistantsolicitor general, thinks the present solicitor general'soffice may be engaging in the latter practice more often --refusing to acquiesce. &quot;They seem to be going to extremes,&quot;he says, to &quot;distinguish&quot; appeals court decisions and &quot;to nothave to acquiesce.&quot;   Solicitor General Kenneth Starr declined to comment on thetrend, or on possible explanations.   A case in point is an appeal by a Treasury employee whosays he was denied a higher-level job due to agediscrimination. The appeals courts are split over theprocedures and the amount of time allowed for federalemployees to file age-discrimination administrativecomplaints or lawsuits. The solicitor general argued that thehigh court shouldn't review the case because the issue wasn'tproperly raised in the Treasury worker's appeal. But thecourt took the case anyway, and will hear the appeal on March19.   There is still another factor that contributes to theincrease in cases granted review over the solicitor general'sobjection. When there are conflicts among the appeals courts,the solicitor general's suggestion that the case isunimportant meets with strong opposition from Justice ByronWhite, who maintains that the court should resolve virtuallyall cases of conflicting interpretations of federal law. Insome cases, he no doubt has persuaded his colleagues to voteto hear the appeals.</TEXT></DOC>
