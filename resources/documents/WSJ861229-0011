Associates C.V., a Dutch limited partnership jointly owned by them, has successfully completed its $50-a-share tender offer for Dallas-based Zale Corp.    Along with Zale shares previously owned by Peoples, the shares tendered constitute about 94% of Zale's common shares outstanding. The acquisition has a total value of $550 million (U.S.).    Peoples and Swarovski said about 10,449,606 Zale shares, including about 2,025,888 shares subject to delivery guarantees or receipt of additional documentation, had been tendered under the offer that expired at 12:01 a.m. Thursday and that all such shares had been or will be purchased. Peoples owned 1,843,559 Zale shares before the offer began.    Peoples and Swarovski said that at a meeting of the Zale board last week, Irving Gerstein, president of Peoples, was elected president and chief executive officer of Zale. All of the Zale directors other than Gerstein and the two other Peoples' designees on the board, Bertrand Gerstein and James Gillies, have resigned.    Peoples and Swarovski said the Zale board will be reconstituted soon to consist of an equal number of Peoples and Swarovski designees.    The companies also said all shares of Zale Series A preferred stock that were not converted and tendered have been called for redemption by Zale and will be redeemed Feb. 9.    As previously reported, all Zale common shares not tendered and purchased will be acquired in a subsequent transaction at the same $50-a-share price.    Both Peoples and Zale are jewelry-store chain operators. Swarovski is a Zurich, Switzerland-based maker and marketer of jewels and crystals. </TEXT></DOC>
