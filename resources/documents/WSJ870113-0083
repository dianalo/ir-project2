OttenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMT LABORECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN) </IN><TEXT>   Warnings of future intergenerational conflict are growing -- and creating a backlash.    Some people object to the changes in government policies -- such as Social Security cutbacks -- recommended by those sounding the warnings. Others say that the warnings themselves are exaggerated.    One conflict scenario predicts a struggle relatively soon, as increased affluence among the elderly -- and increased numbers of children living in poverty -- incite moves to trim Social Security and other programs helping today's elderly.    A more widely advanced forecast sees the conflict erupting in about 25 years -- when the huge baby-boom generation begins to retire and the far smaller baby-bust generation rebels against heavy taxes needed to support the hordes of elderly.    There is &quot;the potential for real generational warfare in the next century,&quot; says Sen. David Durenberger (R., Minn.), who heads a nonprofit research group called Americans for Generational Equity. &quot;Generational equity,&quot; as defined by AGE, means preserving more economic and physical resources for future generations rather than spending them now. The group campaigns for reducing the federal budget deficit, overhauling Social Security and spurring savings and investment.    AGE and a few similar groups and individuals have attracted enough attention to spur into defensive action many organizations interested in the elderly. The Gerontological Society of America, for instance, consisting of researchers on aging, recently produced a book-length study, &quot;Ties That Bind,&quot; stressing generational interdependence. &quot;For any society to progress and prosper,&quot; it declares, &quot;each generation must provide assistance to, and receive assistance from, those that follow.&quot;    The National Council on the Aging and the Child Welfare League of America have taken the lead in forming Generations United, a coalition promoting what it sees as the common interests of children, youths, families and the elderly. The coalition pledges to &quot;combat negative and erroneous information&quot; on intergenerational competition and to work for public policies -- such as health care for the uninsured -- that benefit people of all ages.    The group most actively raising the danger of conflict is the two-year-old AGE. Aiming its message particularly at the 75 million baby boomers, it warns that profligate consumption of economic and physical resources endangers the living standards of next century's workers and the retirement benefits of next century's elderly, including the boomers themselves.    Financed largely by corporate sponsors, AGE seeks to exercise influence through speeches, articles and periodic conferences. Today it is holding a daylong session in Minneapolis on &quot;The Generational Contract: Growth and Productivity in an Aging Society.&quot;    Although AGE writers and speechmakers talk about the need to cut the federal budget deficit and increase productive investment, they dwell particularly on the need to overhaul Social Security and Medicare now to make them more secure for later retirees. It is this talk that especially frightens organizations of the elderly.    The baby-boom generation, AGE publicists note, is the first to be larger than its successor generation. They predict that by the second quarter of the 21st century, when most baby boomers will be eligible for retirement, there will be fewer than two workers to support each retiree, compared with today's ratio of 3.4 to 1. AGE warns that one result might be payroll taxes of anywhere from 23% to 42% to pay for Social Security and Medicare, compared with the current 14.6%.    And that could touch off a tax revolt among the younger generation. Baby boomers &quot;have good reason to fear their successors will desert them,&quot; writes Phillip Longman, AGE's research director.    AGE has shied from being too specific in its prescription. But both Mr. Longman and executive director Paul Hewitt -- themselves baby boomers -- favor raising the retirement age and scaling back benefits for well-to-do retirees.    Some see conflict coming sooner than next century. Stanford University economist Michael Boskin, an AGE advisory-board member, worries that a few years from now Congress may divert the surplus building in the Social Security trust fund.    The temptation will be there, he says, to use the surplus to bail out the Medicare fund, which is projected to run out of money in the late 1990s. &quot;If the Social Security fund is diverted,&quot; he points out, &quot;it just won't be there to avoid a really big tax increase when the boomers retire.&quot;    But many specialists believe generational warfare won't occur. Polls have long shown Social Security, Medicare and even Medicaid with strong support in every age group. Asserts John Rother, the legislative director of the American Association of Retired Persons, a broadly based service and lobbying group: &quot;There is a general American consensus that the country has made certain commitments to different groups and must honor them, and these include Social Security and Medicare.&quot;    One reason conflict will be avoided, these specialists say, is that young people recognize the debt they owe older generations -- not only for caring for them and educating them as children but also for continuing to help them as adults.    &quot;The few studies presently available,&quot; write gerontologist Bernice Neugarten and public-policy analyst Dail Neugarten, &quot;indicate that during the lifetimes of parental generations, a larger amount of financial assistance flows down the family ladder than flows up that ladder. . . . How many parents or grandparents are providing the down payments on homes for young-adult children? How many are providing funds to help divorced daughters who have young children to support?&quot;    More specifically, there's a realization among younger people that the elderly getting government benefits are their own parents and grandparents -- and that if the government doesn't support them, the children may have to themselves.    Other factors may also help minimize trouble when the baby-boom generation starts to retire, specialists say. Employers, faced with a shrinking work force, will offer flexible work hours and other inducements to keep many of them working past normal retirement; these workers will be paying taxes into the Social Security fund rather than drawing benefits from it.    Moreover, says Alicia Munnell, a senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, men and women from the baby-bust years will eventually be in great demand as workers. They are &quot;going to be doing very well financially,&quot; she says, so they may not feel terribly burdened even if some tax increases are necessary.    In the final analysis, the amount of intergenerational conflict may be determined by the overall rate of economic growth. &quot;The single most important ingredient in generational equity is the rate of growth,&quot; says Mr. Boskin. &quot;If the economy is growing reasonably rapidly, problems like Social Security will be much less acute. At sluggish growth, it's a very different picture.&quot;    Similarly, Henry Aaron, a senior fellow of the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C., think tank, says the best way to prepare to support retired baby boomers is to cut the federal budget deficit now and switch more public and private resources into productive investment. &quot;If that is done, nothing else matters very much,&quot; he says. &quot;If it isn't done, nothing else will matter very much either. You'll be rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.&quot;    ---                          YOUNG VS.
