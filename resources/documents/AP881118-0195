The company's stock declined for the second straight sessionThursday amid rumors that one of two known bidders in themultibillion-dollar takeover fight might end its campaign.   Trading in RJR Nabisco stock was halted on the New York StockExchange at 1 p.m. because the number of sell orders swamped buyorders. Trading resumed 34 minutes later when the order imbalanceeased, Big Board officials said.   The stock, which lost $4.50 a share on Wednesday, finished downanother $1.25 to finish at $82.75 in heavy trading.   Brokers said rumors surfaced that leveraged buyout specialistKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. might withdraw its $90-a-share, $20.3billion tender offer for RJR Nabisco.   Heightening the stock market's nervousness was today's biddingdeadline imposed by the company's special committee of outsidedirectors considering buyout offers.   Kohlberg spokesman Thomas Daly said that ``the policy of the firmis not to comment on rumors in the marketplace.''   Speculators in RJR Nabisco stock, which has soared more than 40percent in value since the takeover battle began last month, fearedthat Kohlberg's withdrawal would leave only one bid left, a$92-a-share, $20.7 billion offer from the company's seniormanagement.   Many had been betting that Kohlberg or an unidentified thirdparty might make an even bigger offer.   Rising uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of the biggesttakeover attempt in history intensified Wednesday when ForstmannLittle andamp; Co., a key Kohlberg rival in the takeover business that hadindicated it led a group that might bid for RJR Nabisco, said itwould not submit an offer.   The Wall Street Journal said Thursday that a bid might emergefrom a group consisting of First Boston Corp. and Resource HoldingsLtd., two New York investment firms. Neither would comment on thereport.   Securities analysts following the maneuvering said still therewas some possibility that the RJR Nabisco management group mightjoin Kohlberg to make a single bid, although previous negotiationsfor such an alliance have collapsed several times.   RJR Nabisco's president and chief executive officer, F. RossJohnson, who leads the managers trying to buy the company, has thebacking of the investment firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. andSalomon Brothers Inc.   Atlanta-based RJR, the nation's 19th largest industrial concern,makes such well-known brands as Winston and Camel cigarettes, Oreocookies and Del Monte vegetables.   If any bidder succeeded in buying the entire company, it would bethe biggest corporate acquisition ever. The RJR Nabisco managementand Kohlberg Kravis bids dwarf the $13.4 billion spent in the 1984acquisition of Gulf Oil Corp. by what is now Chevron Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
