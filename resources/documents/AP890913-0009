On a 264-153 vote, the House defeated a motion that would havecommitted it to the restrictions Helms wants to impose on theNational Endowment for the Arts.   Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., the endowment's chief supporter in theHouse, argued successfully that the arts restrictions would amountto censorship and lead to the ``lingering death'' of the 25-year-oldagency.   Endowment critics, upset over the use of federal funds this yearfor photography exhibits that included a picture of Christ on across in a jar of urine and photos of homosexual acts, denied therewould be censorship. They said people have a right to demand thattax dollars not be spent to subsidize art they abhor.   ``The question is sponsorship, not censorship,`` said freshmanRep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., who led the fight on the Housefloor on behalf of Helms' Senate-backed amendment. ``Artists can dowhatever they want on their own time and with their own dime.''   Democrats united behind Yates, however, voting against acceptingHelms' measure by a margin of 212-37. House Republicans, whosecampaign committee already has used the issue against incumbentDemocrats, supported Helms' measure 116-52.   ``We're telling Jesse we respect freedom of expression,'' Rep.Don Edwards, D-Calif., said after the vote.   The battle is not over, however. Helms succeeded in having theSenate place the arts restrictions in an overall spending bill forthe endowment and several other agencies.   The House and Senate have yet to agree on a final version for the$10 billion bill, and Senate negotiators can still fight for thearts restrictions when the two sides meet in conference.   ``The debate now shifts to the hinterland,'' said Rohrabacher,whose failed motion would have instructed House negotiators to yieldto Helms' language. ``I believe there will be another (House) voteon this. I believe Sen. Helms has a few rabbits up his sleeve.''   For more than a month, a coalition of 22 Christian, conservativeand Republican groups have waged a campaign characterizing Yates'planned maneuver as a ``smoke screen'' and ``sham.''   Yates said Helms' measure would reach far beyond what theDemocrat said were mistakes by the endowment in awarding grants thisyear for promoting the two controversial exhibits.   ``It establishes a broad and sweeping pattern of censorship,''Yates said. ``This is the start of George Orwell's big brother; it'sthe communist approach to art.''   Before the vote Wednesday, Democratic leaders thwarted an effortby supporters of the Helms measure to press their point bydisplaying copies of the offending photographs on the House floor.   Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., who was presiding over the House atthe time, denied the request, saying the exhibit would upset thedecorum of the House. The sergeant of arms also was ordered to coverup a display in the speaker's lobby outside the chamber.   The controversy began last spring as a small protest against anindirect $15,000 award by the National Endowment for the Arts tophotographer Andre Serrano, whose exhibited work includes a pictureof Christ on a cross submerged in a jar of urine.   It then mushroomed when the Corcoran Gallery of Art inWashington, fearing a cut in its funds from the endowment, in Junecanceled a show by the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe thatincluded photos of homosexual acts and nude children.   The second-ranking officer of the Corcoran and the organizer ofthe Mapplethorpe show, Jane Livingston, resigned Wednesday, sayingshe planned to complete a book. She said that though she was``appalled'' at the cancellation, done without consulting her, herresignation ``very well may have happened now without any of theotehr events.''   Yates, who chairs the House subcommittee responsible for theendowment's annual appropriation, tried to douse the flames twomonths ago by cutting its $171.4 million budget for next year by$45,000 _ the amount of federal grants that went toward the twocontroversial exhibits.   Unappeased, critics turned to Helms, who two weeks later _ andwith no voiced opposition _ attached his amendment to the Senate'sversion of the appropriations bill.   Helms' amendment would prohibit the endowment from awarding anygrants to museums and artists for promoting or producing ``obsceneor indecent material, including ... depicitions of sadomasochism,homoeroticism, the exploitation of children or individuals engagedin sex acts.''   It also bans support for art that ``denigrates the objects orbeliefs of ... a particular religion or non-religion or denigrates,debases or reviles a person, group or class of citizens on the basisof race, creed, sex, handicap or national origin.''</TEXT></DOC>
