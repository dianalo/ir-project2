Rudeness, lawyers and judges say, now ranks with hugeworkloads and long hours as a major source of professionaldissatisfaction.</LP><TEXT>   How rude? In October, Mississippi's attorney general gotinto a brawl with a defense lawyer in a courtroom. In Dallastwo years ago, a plaintiff's lawyer grabbed an opposingattorney in a head-lock, slammed him against a door andpunched him in the jaw for refusing to leave his office. Andin Denver a year and a half ago, a state judge abruptlystepped down, citing rudeness and incivility in the courtroomas a reason: &quot;Life is too short,&quot; she said.   Practicing law, particularly courtroom litigation, hasnever been for the timid. But in several recent surveys,lawyers and judges lament how a profession once characterizedby mutual respect and lasting relationships has become markedby increasingly abrasive confrontations. Among the reasons:heightened competition and financial pressure, a morebusiness-minded view at law firms, lack of &quot;civilitytraining&quot; in law schools or on the job, and pressure fromclients and judges, some of whom themselves could use arefresher course on manners, according to a report onincivility issued in April by Marvin E. Aspen, a federaljudge in Chicago.   &quot;Some older lawyers look back with nostalgia at theirformer practice,&quot; says Judge Aspen. &quot;They remember thecollegiality, the unhurried and relaxed atmosphere of somecourtrooms, the general honorableness of {the} profession.&quot;   Not everyone agrees that there ever was such a golden ageof genteel lawyering. And some ethics experts say lawyershave a professional duty to use every weapon available onbehalf of their clients, even if it means being obnoxious.&quot;The adversarial system is incompatible with lawyers beingnice to each other all the time,&quot; says Jack Nordby, aMinneapolis attorney who specializes in representing lawyersin disciplinary proceedings.   Nevertheless, personal rudeness has become pervasive, saysJudge Aspen, and ultimately it's the consumer of legalservices who pays. According to a survey of New Jersey StateBar Association members last year, rudeness begets morerudeness, discouraging compromise, derailing potentialsettlements, prolonging cases and driving costs up.Sixty-seven percent of those polled said that civility isdeteriorating in New Jersey and that clients and the generalpublic are worse off as a result.   Much lawyer rudeness is calculated to wear down the otherside. Lawyers routinely fail to return phone calls, makeunreasonable demands for evidence, file mindless responses tolegitimate requests and engage in personal attacks, saysBriane Nelson Mitchell, a partner in the Los Angeles officeof Paul, Hastings, Janofsky andamp; Walker. &quot;What they're trying todo is divert you from the merits of the case,&quot; he says.   Most such abuse occurs outside the presence of judges, atdepositions, during which the parties in litigation interviewopposing witnesses, and during other forms of pretrial factfinding. In Philadelphia, aviation lawyer Arthur Alan Wolkdemanded 350,000 pages of documents from Beech Aircraft Corp.and Pratt andamp; Whitney Canada Inc. in connection with aproductliability case he has pending against the companies.The companies maintained that most of the documents wereirrelevant but provided them anyway last November. Mr. Wolkhas yet to inspect them, says Beech's attorney, Tom P.Monteverde.   Last fall, in the same case, Mr. Wolk abruptly canceled adeposition midway, accusing the other side of coaching itswitness to give false answers. A federal magistrate cited Mr.Wolk for bad faith and poor judgment, fined him $2,000 andordered him to pay the $14,000 copying costs. Mr. Wolk saysthe testimony followed months of delay and obstruction byopposing counsel. &quot;The bottom line is, I would do the samething again tomorrow,&quot; he says.   In other cases, lawyers say, rudeness stems from youthfulzeal and inexperience. After Minneapolis attorney ParisDonRay Getty was ordered out of a judge's chambers after aruling against his client, he stood outside in a rage andpounded on the closed door with his fist, shouting: &quot;You knowyou're wrong]&quot;   The Minnesota Supreme Court, noting that Mr. Getty &quot;has anexcitable personality,&quot; let him off with a warning. But Mr.Getty remains unbowed: &quot;I have a professional responsibilityto be zealous,&quot; he says.   Clients also play a role in how their lawyers act.Influenced by the hyperbolic and hyper-aggressive advocacydepicted in film and on television, they often haveunrealistic expectations of how their own lawyers shouldbehave, particularly in such emotionally charged cases asdivorce. &quot;I've had clients question my friendliness withanother lawyer: `How could you shake hands with him]?'&quot; saysJill Nicholson, staff director for the American BarAssociation's committee on professionalism.   &quot;There are two categories of clients,&quot; says Leslie Lawson,a former trial judge in Denver. &quot;Some think they've hired agreat fighter because {the lawyer} fights everyone,&quot; shesays. Others are appalled by the disrespect they see incourtrooms.   Ms. Lawson was so dismayed that she resigned her seat onthe Denver District Court in late 1989 after 3 1/2 years.&quot;You go out to the bench only to be greeted by a lawyer whohas decided that the best way to present the case is toscream and yell at the judge, or at opposing counsel,&quot; shesays. That stress only compounds an already difficult job,she adds.   Judges have bad days, too. Jurists from the U.S. SupremeCourt down have become increasingly testy in theirdisagreements with fellow judges, says William J. Bauer,chief judge of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals inChicago. In Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services Inc., a1989 U.S. Supreme Court opinion narrowing abortion rights,Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that aspects of Justice SandraDay O'Connor's dissenting view &quot;cannot be taken seriously&quot;and called it &quot;irrational.&quot; In the same case, Justice HarryA. Blackmun charged that some of his colleagues in themajority had &quot;gone about their business in . . . a deceptivefashion.&quot;   Parties to cases can feel the sting of judges' disrespect.In Florida in December, an appeals court admonished BrowardCounty Circuit Judge Paul B. Marko for suggesting to a womanin a divorce proceeding that she was a &quot;bimbo&quot; who should &quot;goout and get another guy&quot; at a singles bar. The judge laterapologized, but an appeals court forced him off the case.   To deal with growing complaints of rudeness, state andlocal bar groups have begun adopting courtesy codes andlawyers creeds to guide lawyers' manners. In Chicago, JudgeAspen's committee on incivility has recommended that lawschools and law firms &quot;immediately consider the developmentof civility training.&quot;   Some judges and lawyers are taking matters into their ownhands. When a Houston attorney told a judge that hercourtroom was a &quot;disgrace&quot; two years ago, she ordered thelawyer to publish an apology in the Houston Post and theHouston Chronicle, as well as in two Texas legal newspapers.And after Dallas lawyer G. David Westfall slugged Stephen E.Fox during a deposition in his office in July 1989, a judgegave him a choice: a $10,000 fine, or a $2,000 fine pluspersonal and written apologies.   Mr. Westfall con cedes he made a mistake, but says Mr. Foxasked for it by dragging out a simple deposition and refusingto leave his office. &quot;Under all those circumstances,&quot; Mr.Westfall maintains, &quot;I'd probably do the same thing again.&quot;   No amount of discipline will change some lawyers, saysTexas Supreme Court Justice Eugene Cook. &quot;They were bornrude,&quot; he says.   In February, Mr. Mitchell, the Los Angeles lawyer, wrotean impassioned appeal for better manners in CaliforniaLawyer, a legal magazine. It drew this response from a lawyerin College Station, Texas: &quot;{Mr.} Mitchell's tawdry littlepiece is a disgrace to the profession. I can't help butwonder why California Lawyer would trouble to print thesniveling of a coward.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
