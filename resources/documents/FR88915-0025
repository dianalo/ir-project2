History of andSection;510.450</ITAG>Section 510.450 was initially promulgated as andSection;135.102 (21 CFR 135.102)in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 23, 1970 (35 FR 16538). As a provisionof Subpart B of 21 CFR Part 135, the regulation constituted one of FDA'sstatements of policy and interpretation regarding animal drugs and medicatedfeeds and applied to all oral or parenteral sulfonamide-containing drugsfor use in food-producing animals. Section 135.102 required sponsors ofsuch drugs to submit, within 1 year (by October 22, 1971), residue depletiondata to permit the agency to establish withdrawal periods for the durgs'use that would ensure that edible products from treated animals are safefor consumption. Section 135.102 established as an interim measure a 5-daywithdrawal period for poultry and a 10-day withdrawal period for all otherfood-producing animals. FDA promulgated andSection;135.102 because new informationavailable to the agency showed that, under certain circumstances wherefood-producing animals had been treated with oral or parenteral sulfonamide-containingdrugs, the drugs could be detected in the edible products of such animalswhen they were slaughtered within 10 days of the last treatment (35 FR16538).In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 20, 1973 (38 FR 19404), FDA advised thatall sulfonamide-containing drugs labeled for oral, injectable, intrauterine,or intramammary use in food-producing animals are new animal drugs withinthe meaning of section 201(w) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the act) (21 U.S.C. 321(w)), for which approved NADA's are required undersection 512(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360(a)). The agency's determinationthat such drugs are new animal drugs was based in part on the results ofthen recently available studies raising concerns about thyroid toxicityassociated with exposure to sulfonamide-containing drugs, and in part onthe lack of adequate data to establish the safety of residues of such drugsin edible products. Accordingly, FDA proposed to revise andSection;135.102to permit firms marketing products containing sulfonamide drugs that werenot the subject of approved NADA's to continue marketing the products onan interim basis, provided they submitted NADA's by October 18, 1973, andmade a commitment to conduct and submit the results of 90-day feeding studies(toxicity studies) in one rodent and one nonrodent species so that thedegree of thyroid response to sulfonamide drugs could be evaluated. FDAalso stated that if an evaluation of the results of those studies showedthat the existing methods used to establish tolerances for residues ofsulfonamide-containing drugs in edible products were not of adquate specificityand sensitivity, the agency would require sponsors to develop more specificand sensitive methods.In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 22, 1974 (39 FR 26633), FDA publisheda final rule amending andSection;135.102 as proposed on July 20, 1973. Inthe preamble to the final rule, the agency explained that:1. All sulfonamide-containing drugs for oral, injectable, intramammary,and intrauterine use in food-producing animals are now deemed to be newanimal drugs for which an approved NADA will be required.2. The results of 90-day subacute toxicity studies must be submitted byeach sponsor of such drugs for their continued use as a basis for determininga ``no-effect'' level in laboratory animals.3. Residue data must be submitted on each species and under the recommendedconditions of use for each such drug to establish safe withdrawal periodsand to assure that edible products from treated animals are safe for humanconsumption.The final rule provided that the results of the ``subacute toxicity studies''were to be submitted by July 22, 1975. That date was extended to October22, 1975 (40 FR 43213; September 19, 1975). The final rule required sponsorsof approved NADA's that had not already submitted the studies and the newmethods, as well as sponsors that had been given interim marketing privileges,to submit such information. The final rule established January 20, 1975,as the due date for NADA's for sulfonamide-containing drugs permitted interimmarketing privileges. FDA has not given such privileges to sponsors thatdid not meet that deadline. In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 27, 1975 (40 FR 13802 at 13808), andSection;135.102 was redesignated as andSection; 510.450 (21 CFR 510.450) and wasreissued under Subpart E_Requirements for Specific New Animal Drugs ofPart 510.In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 9, 1977 (42 FR 62211), FDA announcedthat all firms marketing sulfamethazine-containing products for use inswine feed or drinking water had been requested by letter to submit labelingbearing a 15-day withdrawal period prior to slaughtering treated animalsfor food. In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 5, 1978 (43 FR 19385), FDA amended andSection;510.450 to require that products containing sulfamethazine intended foruse in swine feed or drinking water be labeled with a 15-day withdrawalperiod. By January 20, 1975, 28 firms had submitted 229 NADA's requesting interimmarketing of sulfonamide-containing products under andSection; 510.450. ByJuly 1984, products covered by 189 pending NADA's held by 23 firms werepermitted interim marketing under andSection; 510.450; the sulfonamide-containingproducts covered by the remaining NADA's were no longer being marketed.Throughout the 1970's and early 1980's, the agency communicated extensivelywith the sponsors of the NADA's, orally and in writing, concerning thedata, labeling, and other information necessary for approval of the NADA's.FDA has not approved, under section 512(c) of the act, any of these NADA's.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. The July 5, 1984 Notice </ITAG>FDA, in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 5, 1984 (49 FR 27543) (corrected 49 FR31444; August 7, 1984), announced plans for the termination of interimmarketing under andSection; 510.450 for drugs containing sulfamethazine,sulfaquinoxaline, sulfamerazine, sulfathiazole, sulfapyridine, or sulfanilamideor oral, injectable, intramammary, or intrauterine use in food-producinganimals. The July 1984 notice listed the 23 firms that had submitted NADA'sfor sulfonamide-containing drugs under the provisions of andSection; 510.450,together with the NADA numbers and product names for products then marketedunder the regulation, and requested that sponsors of NADA's covered byinterim marketing submit a statement of intent with regard to continuedmarketing of their products. The July 1984 notice then requested that thesponsors submit data, revised labeling, and other information necessaryfor approval of an NADA. The July 1984 notice stated that after evaluationof the information with respect to each NADA, FDA would either approvethe NADA or publish notices of opportunity for hearing on denial of approvalof the pending NADA's. Finally, the July 1984 notice stated that, at thesame time, the agency would publish a proposed rule to remove andSection;510.450, and that after a final rule removing andSection; 510.450 becauseeffective, any sulfonamide-containing drug on the market intended for usein food-producing animals that was not the subject of an approved NADAwould be in violation of the act and subject to regulatory action, unlesscovered by a statutorily provided exception to the requirement of an NADA.At the time of the July 1984 notice, sulfonamide-containing products coveredby 189 pending NADA's were permitted interim marketing under andSection;510.450. FDA received letters from the 23 firms listed in the July 1984notice. Eight firms requested termination of 32 NADA's. Twenty-one firmsindicated their intent to furnish the information necessary for approvalof 157 NADA's. Nine of the 21 firms submitted some of the necessary information(for 17 of their 65 NADA's); 14 of the 21 firms did not submit any of theinformation (for 92 NADA's). None of the 23 firms listed in the July 1984notice furnished all the data, labeling, and other information necessaryfor approval of any of the 189 NADA's in question On May 23, 1986, FDA wrote the sponsors of each of the then pending 157NADA's, once again advising each sponsor of deficiencies in each NADA thatprecluded approval and of the data, revised labeling, and other informationnecessary for approval. At present, sulfonamide-containing products coveredby 142 pending NADA's held by 11 firms are permitted interim marketingunder andSection; 510.450; the sulfonamide-containing products covered bythe remaining NADA's are no longer being marketed. None of the 142 pendingNADA's containing all the data, labeling, and other information necessaryfor approval. Indeed, as discussed above, only nine sponsors (for 17 oftheir 65 NADA's) submitted even part of the data, labeling, and other informationspecified in the July 1984 notice. In addition, each of those NADA's isalso deficient in one or more other respects, e.g., inadequate manufacturingand controls information or lack of an environmental assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. The Proposed Rule </ITAG>For the sake of simplicity and consistency, FDA is now proposing to removeandSection; 510.450 in its entirety. The agency advises, however, that itis specifically reaffirming that two provisions of the regulation continueto represent FDA's interpretation of the act, even though the agency isnot proposing to retain them in the Code of Federal Regulations. Thoseprovisions are as follows: 1. The presence of sulfonamide residues in food constitutes an adulterationwithin the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(D) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(D))in the absence of a tolerance for such residues established pursuant tosection 512(i) of the act. 2. Sulfonamide-containing drugs for oral, injectable, intrauterine or intramammaryuse in food-producing animals are new animal drugs for which approved newanimal drug applications are required. FDA is proposing to remove andSection; 510.450 for three reasons. 1. As explained in Section II of this preamble, only nine sponsors of 17NDDA's (out of 23 sponsors of the 189 NADA's covering interim marketingof sulfonamide products under andSection; 510.450 when the July 1984 noticewas published) have submitted any data, labeling, or other informationin response to the July 1984 notice, and none of those sponsors has submittedall the data, labeling, and other information necessary for approval, asspecified in that notice. Four years have elapsed since publication ofthe July 1984 notice. In accordance with its plans to terminate interimmarketing under andSection; 510.450, announced in that notice, the agencyis proposing to remove the regulation, thereby discontinuing the marketingprivileges that it provided.2. As explained in Section I of this preamble, interim marketing of sulfonamide-containingproducts intended for use in food-producing animals has been permittedsince 1970, and since 1973 FDA has made it clear that it regards thoseproducts as new animal drugs requiring approved NADA's. Throughout theexistence of andSection; 510.450 (and its predecessor, andSection; 135.102),the agency has attempted to persuade sponsors of the NADA's covering interimmarketing of sulfonamide-containing products to submit to their NADA'sdata, labeling, and other information necessary for approval. Accordingly,it is appropriate to terminate interim marketing under 21 CFR 510.450.3. Although there are narrowly defined circumstances in which FDA may affirmativelypermit the marketing of a violative product, see, e.g., <T3>CNI </T3>v.<T3> Young, </T3>818 F.2d 943, 949-50 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <T3>Public Citizen </T3>v. <T3>Schmidt, </T3>No. 76-405 (D.D.C. 1976) \1\<NOTE/>; and the Paragraph XIV exemption developed in response to<T3>American Public Health Ass'n </T3>v. <T3>Veneman, </T3>349 F. Supp. 1331 (D.D.C. 1972), FDA does not have theauthority to convey a right to market an unapproved new animal drug. See<T3>Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Weinberger, </T3>425 F. Supp. 890, 894 (D.D.C. 1975); <T3>Culter </T3>v. <T3>Kennedy, </T3>475 F. Supp. 838, 854 (D.D.C. 1979); see also <T3>American Public Health Ass'n </T3>v. <T3>Veneman, supra. </T3>In the circumstances of this matter (see SectionsI and II Of this preamble), the agency believes that interim marketingof sulfonamide-containing products is no longer consistent with the lawor justified by the facts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>Public Citizen </T3>v. <T3>Schmidt </T3>held that FDA could reasonably decide to leave drugs containinga carcingogen, chloroform, on the market for three and a half months followingpublication of a final rule prohibiting the use of chloroform in drugs.FDA also notes that additional questions have been raised concerning thesafety (carcinogenicity) of sulfamethazine in light of the results of chronicbioassays of sulfamethazine in mice (Ref. 1) and rats (Ref. 2) conductedby the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR). (The mouse studyis discussed in 53 FR 15886 at 15888 (May 4, 1988); the rat study is discussedin 53 FR 17850 (May 18, 1988).) The data from NCTR's mouse and rat studiesare undergoing review by the National Toxicology Program and FDA, and theagency will not reach any final conclusions on the presence or absenceof tumors in the test animals and on the significance of any tumors inthe test animals until the reviews are completed. FDA believes, however,that the additional questions that have been raised about the safety ofsulfamethazine provide further support for the removal of andSection; 510.450insofar as it provides for interim marketing of sulfamethazine-containingproducts. But the agency stresses that any final rule based on this proposalto terminate interim marketing, as previously announced in the July 1984notice, will not depend on the results of the reviews of the NCTR studies.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Effective Date</ITAG>Because of the extent of use of sulfonamide-containing products over manyyears and the need for an orderly transition to the use of approved newanimal drugs, FDA is proposing that any final rule based on this proposalbecome effective for any sulfonamide-containing drug product that is notthe subject of an approved NADA by 90 days after the final rule's dateof publication in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>As FDA stated in the July 1984 notice (49 FR27547), after any final rule removing andSection; 510.450 becomes effective,any sulfonamide-containing drug product on the market intended for usein food-producing animals that is not the subject of an approved NADA willbe in violation of the act and subject to regulatory action, unless coveredby a statutorily provided exception to the requirement of an NADA.In the July 1984 notice, FDA stated that it intended to publish noticesof opportunity for hearing on denial of approval of the pending NADA'sfor sulfonamide-containing drugs for use in food-producing animals thatare covered by interim marketing at the same time it published this proposalto remove andSection; 510.450. The agency has reconsidered its earlier statementof intent and concluded that publication of this proposal should not awaitpublication of the notices of opportunity for hearing, given the historyof andSection; 510.450 and the agency's unsuccessful attempts to persuadethe sponsors of those NADA's to submit the data, labeling, and other informationnecessary for approval (see Sections I and II of this preamble). In thenear future, however, CVM will publish a notice of opportunity for hearingon denial of approval for those applications.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Environmental Impact</ITAG>The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effectsof this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significantimpact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statementis not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and theevidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment,may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. This action was considered underFDA's final rule implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (21CFR Part 25).<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Economic Impact </ITAG>In accordance with Executive Order 12291, FDA has carefully analyzed theeconomic effects of this proposal and has determined that the final rule,if promulgated, will not be a major rule as defined by the Order. This proposed rule will affect approximately 11 firms sponsoring 142 NADA'sfor sulfonamide-containing products. It is estimated that 5 of these firmsmarket products that generate sales at levels that might warrant theirgathering the data required to obtain NADA approval. These products accountfor a small share of the present market for therapeutic sulfonamide-containingproducts. The remaining six firms have insignificant sales of such productsand might not undertake to gather the data required to obtain NADA approval.The 11 affected firms are the remaining marketers of sulfonamide-containingproducts among 23 firms sponsoring NADA's for such products covered byinterim marketing for many years. The agency estimates that the costs of studies resulting from this proposedrule will total less than $3 million for all the affected products withsignificant sales. This estimate is based on the expectations that residuedepletion studies will be conducted for four to six chemical entities ofsulfonamides and that bioequivalency studies will be conducted for abouthalf of the currently marketed sulfonamide-containing products. The economicconsequences of the requirement for conducting the studies in questionshould have been anticipated by the affected firms because the eventualobligation to gather the data required to obtain NADA approval was inherentin the conditions of the interim marketing privileges. Firms that madeappropriate financial provisions for gathering the requisite data during17 years of marketing sulfonamide-containing products should experienceno adverse economic effects from the termination of interim marketing.All but one of the sulfonamide-containing products affected by this proposalhave approved substitute products available for use. The one drug withoutan approved substitute is sulfaquinoxaline used to treat fowl cholera inpheasants and quail. This product is not used extensively and the terminationof interim marketing is not expected to produce adverse economic effects.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
