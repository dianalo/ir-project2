The frequency spectrum of radiation, which passed throughthe absorber, is found. An anomalous transmission of {gamma}-quanta througha vibrating absorber is shown to arise under certain conditions due tothe excitation of electromagnetic wave packets in the plate, which donot interact with nuclei.</TEXT></DOC>
