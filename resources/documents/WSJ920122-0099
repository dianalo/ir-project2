The case, which involves abortion regulations enacted inPennsylvania, could become a flashpoint in the 1992elections. A decision could come as early as June or July,right in the thick of the presidential race.</LP><TEXT>   But in an order issued yesterday, the Supreme Courtindicated that it might not address the basic question ofwhether to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decisionrecognizing a constitutional right to abortion. The courtinstructed the parties in the Pennsylvania case to limittheir arguments to the constitutionality of specificprovisions of the state's law. Among the measures in disputeare requirements that minors seeking an abortion get theirparents' permission and that women notify their husbands.   The court's order, while somewhat unusual, isn'tsurprising, given the public furor over Roe vs. Wade and thejustices' general desire to portray the court as decidinglegal rather than political questions. Still, the order mayadd credence to the contention of Pennsylvania's attorneygeneral, Ernest Preate, that the court can, if it chooses,decide the case without reconsidering Roe vs. Wade.   Abortion-rights activists challenging the Pennsylvania lawhad pressed the high court to rule directly on thefundamental issue of whether Roe vs. Wade remains valid law.These activists aren't optimistic about winning before thehigh court, but hope that a major anti-abortion decisionwould cause a political backlash against President Bush andother Republican candidates in November.   In their petition seeking Supreme Court review, theabortion-rights forces had asked the justices to rule on thecore conclusion of a highly unconventional decision by thefederal appeals court in Philadelphia. The appeals court saidin October that the Supreme Court's decisions in recent yearsupholding various abortion restrictions, in effect, havenullified Roe vs. Wade. Lower courts rarely announce thedemise of a Supreme Court precedent when the justices haven'tdone so themselves. The Philadelphia appeals court approvedmost of the law, but struck down the spousal-noticerequirement.   Despite the Supreme Court's order that the parties confinetheir arguments to the Pennsylvania restrictions, KathrynKolbert of the American Civil Liberties Union predicted that&quot;the court is likely to use this case to abolish fundamentalconstitutional rights to choose abortion or birth control.&quot;   Ms. Kolbert represents Planned Parenthood, which ischallenging the Pennsylvania law. She and otherabortion-rights proponents have stressed that because thelower court cast doubt on Roe vs. Wade's viability, theSupreme Court must address that question. Roe struck down anoutright abortion ban by the state of Texas; cases involvingsimilarly sweeping prohibitions in Louisiana, Utah and Guamare working their way toward the Supreme Court.   James Bopp, a prominent anti-abortion lawyer who isdefending the Louisiana ban in the lower courts, agreed withhis opponents that the high court hasn't committed itself oneway or the other to ruling on the ultimate question of thevalidity of Roe vs. Wade. He also concurred that the19-year-old precedent &quot;is now before the court,&quot; if five ormore justices want to reverse it.   Attorney General Preate of Pennsylvania, in contrast,stresses that his state's law is constitutional in itsentirety, and can be upheld without overturning Roe vs. Wade.Mr. Preate was &quot;pleased&quot; by the Supreme Court's agreeing tohear the case, an aide said.   While a majority of the sitting justices have indicatedopposition to Roe vs. Wade, the court has passed up severalopportunities to reverse the decision. The Philadelphiaappeals court interpreted the Supreme Court's splintered andsometimes ambiguous pronouncements on the subject to meanthat while the right to abortion still deserves someconstitutional protection, it no longer enjoys the extremelyhigh degree of protection provided by Roe vs. Wade.   The majority in Roe concluded that abortion is a&quot;fundamental right,&quot; meaning that any government regulationof the right would have to survive the most stringentjudicial scrutiny. Under this &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard, thegovernment must demonstrate a &quot;compelling&quot; interest inabridging a right.   The Philadelphia appeals court said, however, that as aresult of recent Supreme Court decisions construing Roenarrowly, the appropriate standard of protection is asignificantly less demanding one proposed by Justice SandraO'Connor in dissenting opinions in the 1980s. JusticeO'Connor has urged that abortion regulations &quot;rationally&quot;related to a &quot;legitimate&quot; government purpose ought to beupheld unless they place an &quot;undue burden&quot; on a woman'sfreedom to choose to terminate her pregancy.   Applying the O'Connor standard, the Philadelphia appealscourt upheld provisions requiring that doctors provide womenwith state-prescribed information about pregnancy andabortion, and delaying the abortion procedure for at least 24hours after the recitation, among others.
