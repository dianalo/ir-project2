North was the target of a potentialassassination plot that involved one of eight men charged withillegal pro-Libyan activities in the United States, anadministration source says.   The man, Mousa Hawamda, is a naturalized American who wasidentified Wednesday at an arraignment hearing for six of thosearrested in the alleged scheme, which prosecutors said involveddiversion of Libyan funds to support anti-American activities.   Hawamda was described as a Libyan intelligence operative whooperates under the guise of a Washington travel agency owner.   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said that based on informationreceived by the FBI, Hawamda ``was involved in a potential plot toassassinate a high government official of the United States.''Hudson did not identify the official or give any other details.   But another official, speaking on condition he not beidentified, said the target was North, a former National SecurityCouncil aide and a major player in the Iran-Contra arms and moneyscandal.   North, who was fired from his NSC post in November 1986 overallegations that he illegally funneled money to the Contra rebelsin Nicaragua, masterminded counterterrorism operations againstLibya, including the April 1986 aerial bombing of Tripoli.   During the congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair,North said threats against his life had prompted him to install asecurity fence around his home.   The eight who were arrested Wednesday by the FBI were broughtbefore judges and ordered held without bail pending detentionhearings later this week. Six of the men appeared before a U.S.magistrate in nearby Alexandria, Va., and were then led out withtheir hands and legs shackled; another one was being held inDetroit; the eighth was picked up in Denver.   Hudson said defendant Saleh Mohamed Guima Al-Rajhi, 32, hadgiven the Libyan government a list of U.S. officials who may havebeen involved in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya. The prosecutorsaid this was done for the purpose of retaliation by Libya.   ``This is a rare case, a sensitive case involving nationalsecurity,'' Hudson told the magistrate. He said the prosecution hadobtained much of the information leading to the arrests frominformants whose lives were in danger.   ``Our intention is to try and protect them as long aspossible,'' Hudson said.   Six of the eight arrested were described as members of thePeople's Committee for Libyan Students, based in McLean, Va. Theother two were the owner of the Manara Travel Agency and an agentfor the company, according to the FBI.   All were charged with violating a license allowing the studentorganization to provide financial support for Libyan students inthe United State and Canada.   The prosecution alleged that the organization diverted funds topay for some 200 Americans, among them Black Muslims and Indians,to travel to Libya for anti-American demonstrations.   The violations carry a possible penalty of five yearsimprisonment and up to a $250,000 fine.   Travel to Libya is prohibited by U.S. sanctions imposed on thatcountry in 1981 and 1986 because of its alleged involvement ininternational terrorism. However, the United States allowed theLibyan organization to open an office here in 1986 in order toprovide financial support for some 200 Libyan students in thecountry.   In affidavits presented to the court, the prosecution saidHawamda's Manara Travel Agency in downtown Washington was begunwith $35,000 provided by Libyan intelligence. The agency suppliedfalse billing information to the student organization to hide thereal use of the money, according to the documents.   The other defendants are: the student committee's chairman,Milad Shibani, 34; former chairman Salem Omar Zubeidy, 39, agraduate student at the University of Michigan; Mahdi MohammadAbousetta, 35; Ramadan Taher Belgasem, 33; Adel Ali Sennosi, 30;and Manhal Ben Mohamed, 23, a travel agent working for Hawamda.   All the organization members told the magistrate they wereregistered as full-time students in masters or doctoral programs.</TEXT></DOC>
