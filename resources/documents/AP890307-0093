Mr. President, this is supposed to be _ the theme of the weekis drugs this week, and you mentioned again this morning yourcommitment to ridding the country of drugs. But your designate fordrug czar, William Bennett, has said that, as part of what _ the waythat he would like to help end drug violence would be to consider aban on semiautomatic weapons, which is opposed to your ownviewpoint. And we're getting more and more evidence from doctors andpolice that there's gunfire in the streets and wounds that theyhaven't seen since the Vietnam War, because of these weapons. Whatdo you say to people whose families have _ family members have beenmaimed by these kinds of weapons?   A. I say the same thing I say to a person whose family has maimedby a pistol or a explosive charge or whatever else it might be _ afire _ this is bad, and we have got to stop the scourge of drugs.   And I talked to Bill Bennett about that, because I said, ``Bill,what can be worked out with finality on AK-47s? What can be done andstill, you know, do what's right by the legitimate sportsman?''   I'd love to find an answer to that, Rita, because I do think thatthere has to be some assurance that these automated attack weaponsare not used in the manner they're being used.   So I'd like to _ and I told Bill. I said, ``Look, I _ don't worryabout what you said up there.'' I said, ``I can identify with whatwas behind your thinking on that very, very easily.''   I'd like to find some accommodation.   The problem, as you know, is that automated AK-47s are banned,and semiautomated are not.   So in they come; and then they get turned over to automatedweapons by _ through some filing down.   It isn't as easy as it seems to those who are understandablycrying out, ``Do something. Do something.''   But I've tasked Bill; I've said, ``Bill, work the problem. Findout. And I'm not so rigid that I can't, if you come to me with asensible answer that takes care of the concerns I've felt over theyears, I'll take a hard look at it and I'll work with you to thatend.''   Dave?   Q. Mr. President, do you support the Republican CongressionalCommittee's decision to make Jim Wright its No. 1 target next year?And doesn't that conflict with your _   A. Hey, listen, I've got enough fights on my hands now, Dave.   I _ (laughter) _ I'm not looking for any more.   Let the Congress do its thing, and I'll just stay right where Iam plugging away on a matter of principle for a battle that's goingon in the _ I'll let you know if I want to take on any more.   Yeah?   Q. Mr. President, on foreign policy, there's some confusion overhow you feel about linkage, about linking Soviet good behavior,particularly in Central America, to granting them technologicaltransfers and economic credits. If Gorbachev helps you in CentralAmerica, specifically Nicaragua, are you willing to help himeconomically?</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD></DOC>
