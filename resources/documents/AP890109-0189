Foreign Minister Jadalah Azouz Ettalhi, speaking at aninternational conference on chemical weapons, dismissed U.S. chargesthat Libya has a chemical weapons plant as ``clearly false.''   The Libyan minister mentioned the United States only once by name_ to condemn the downing of two Libyan jet fighters last week _ andreferred to Israel as the ``racist Zionist entity.''   He urged the international community to condemn the incident Jan.4 over the Mediterranean as a military aggression. The United Stateshas said its action was in self-defense.   Charges that Israel has nuclear weapons are at the heart of acampaign by Arab states to link bans on nuclear and chemical arms.The issue has stymied progress on a final communique to be issuedWednesday at the close of the five-day conference.   Ettalhi said the U.S. position on chemical weapons wasdiscriminatory.   The United States and the Soviet Union admit to having largestockpiles of chemical weapons _ the only two countries to make suchan admission of about 20 nations presumed to possess the weapons.   There is a widespread fear that nations without a nuclearcapability will stock chemical arms.   ``How can any member of the international community proclaim aright it denies others,'' Ettalhi said, ``while at the same timelaunching a vile campaign of calumny on the basis of adiscriminatory, racist position?''   ``Agreed international rules must be applied to all partieswithout discrimination,'' the Libyan minister said.   Earlier Monday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze toldreporters that evidence presented to him by Secretary of StateGeorge Shultz on the alleged chemical weapons plant at Rabta, southof the Libyan capital of Tripoli, did not prove anything.   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, also attending theconference, charged Monday that Iraq, Syria and Libya _ three bitterfoes of Israel _ have chemical arms and represent ``a directthreat.''   U.S. arms control official Lynn Hansen, asked about Libya'scharge that Israel has nuclear weapons and that the United Stateshelped it obtain them, said: ``I'm not going to get down and grovelwith the Libyans about this or that.''   Israel has never responded directly to allegations it has nuclearweapons, saying only it will not be the first country to introducesuch weapons into the Middle East.   Britain joined the United States on Monday in rejecting a linkbetween nuclear and chemical weapons bans.   Ettalhi's speech was widely regarded as subdued in a conferencethat has seen outbursts and public disputes since it began Saturday.   Most delegates walked out of the conference hall before a speechearlier Monday by South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha.   Hansen, head of the bureau of multilateral affairs at the U.S.arms control agency, called the conference ``positive'' but admitteddifficulty in reaching a consensus on the final statement.   The conference is aimed at reaffirming the only existinginternational document on chemical weapons _ the 1925 GenevaProtocol banning their use _ and pressing for a global,comprehensive ban.   Iraq's known use of chemical weapons in its eight-year war withIran has served as a macabre backdrop for delegates. A top U.S.expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said evidence shows thatIraq was the chief producer of chemical arms among Arab nations,followed by Syria. He said he had no information on Israel.   A conference source said the final statement would necessarilyhave to accommodate the demands of the Arab nations.   The statement ``will have to take into account the preoccupationsof certain Arab countries,'' said the source, speaking on conditionof anonymity. ``But it is a bit too early to say what form that willtake.''   A working version of the final statement obtained by TheAssociated Press made no direct reference to linking nuclear andchemical arms. But it referred to the need to obtain ``general andcomplete disarmament.''   It called on each state here to ``exercise restraint and actresponsibly'' on the issue of chemical arms until a conventionbanning use, production and stocking of chemical weapons is reached.   The final document will be of a political nature with noenforcement power. But it is meant to pressure negotiators in Genevato overcome obstacles in talks that have languished for nearly adecade.   The Geneva convention would ban use, production and stockpilingof chemical arms by all nations, but negotiators have failed toreach agreement on such major issues as verification.</TEXT></DOC>
