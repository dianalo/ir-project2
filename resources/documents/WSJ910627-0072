The stock sank $3.625 a share to $70.375 in late New YorkStock Exchange trading yesterday, bringing the total declinesince Monday to 20%.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It looks like management is going underground andstopping communication,&quot; said Montgomery Securities analystDonald Crowley. &quot;And no one I talked to was satisfied aboutthe information that came out yesterday&quot; during a conferencecall with analysts who follow the bank holding company.   Wells Fargo disclosed Tuesday that a $350 millionloan-loss provision, related mainly to loans to highlyleveraged buyouts and other businesses, would causesecond-quarter earnings to drop to about $15 million, or 20cents a share, down 94% from the year-ago level. It also saidnonaccruing and restructured loans would increase by $450million. But it declined to be more specific about thesources of its problems.   On Monday, the day before the announcement, the stock fell$6.375 a share. Bank officials had no explanation for thatdrop. Some analysts may have advised select clients to sellbased on inferences they drew from the bank's failure torespond to questions about its performance late last week.   The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to commenton whether it plans to investigate stock trading prior to thebank's disclosure, but such a big price decline routinelytriggers an inquiry.   Separately, a group of shareholders filed a class-actionlawsuit against Wells Fargo in a San Francisco federal courtalleging that the bank misrepresented its financial conditionto investors and failed to disclose material facts.   A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on the suit.</TEXT></DOC>
