Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IBM </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   Chase Manhattan Bank just had to have them: 40 IBM PS/2 personal computers with &quot;Micro Channel Architecture.&quot; Nothing else would do for its new currency trading room.    No matter that they cost more than competing brands. No other machine in the world has the Micro Channel. International Business Machines Corp. invented it, patented it, and for nearly a year has touted it. Chase looked at some fine IBM clones, but in the end they didn't have a chance.    Funny thing about this Micro Channel, though. Even now, many people still aren't sure what it does. Like Robert Schwartz, the computer specialist who selected the IBMs at Chase. &quot;I don't know a lot about it, quite frankly,&quot; he confesses. &quot;It facilitates communications, if I'm not mistaken. You tell me.&quot;    What some would tell Mr. Schwartz is that the Micro Channel isn't mere technology. It is IBM's mystery ingredient: an electronic version of the &quot;MFP&quot; in Colgate toothpaste or the &quot;Chlorinol&quot; inside Comet cleanser, intended to give IBM's PC extra zing in a crowd of look-alikes. As such, the Micro Channel is one of IBM's most audacious marketing gambits ever.    Nobody suggests the Micro Channel, or any other mystery ingredient for that matter, is a fake. IBM says the Micro Channel zips data through a PC like a race car down a super highway. But as much as anything, its mission is to create a premium image, and preferably command a premium price, that will rebuild IBM's prowess and profit margins in a business that is starting to resemble the hawking of the lowliest of commodities.    Promoting the Micro Channel, admits one IBM strategist, is like &quot;telling you that the engine in your car has aluminum double-skirted pistons. . . . There is a benefit, but it's a techno-weenie.&quot;    Granted, personal computers are more high-tech than soap and toothpaste. Users, however, increasingly see them as tools assembled out of widely available bits and pieces by any number of competent companies. The gee-whiz image of the early days of personal computers has faded.    &quot;It's a perfectly expected thing to happen to computers,&quot; says Bob Raymond, a McKinsey andamp; Co. consultant and a former Procter andamp; Gamble Co. brand manager for Tide. Competition is shifting to claims of &quot;specific advantages on products that are overall similar -- which is very much like most consumer products in America.&quot;    That kind of world is an increasing headache for IBM. Its first line of PCs, born in 1981, was overrun by clones that had all the features of a Big Blue computer for less money.    Now, in its second attempt to grab leadership in the $40 billion personal-computer market, the thing it wants most to avoid is a repeat. The PS/2, introduced last spring, is supposed to rise above the rest with its exclusive new technology -- principally the Micro Channel. That should regain IBM market share and also support a nice 10% to 20% premium in list prices over most rivals.    It is still too soon to say whether the strategy is working, partly because many planned features for the machines aren't out yet. IBM says it shipped 1.5 million PS/2s by the end of January and couldn't meet demand for several models at year end. For all of last year, IBM says it shipped 25% more PCs to retail stores than the year before. That figure includes some earlier models as well as PS/2s.    On the other hand, others in the PC business think IBM's PS/2 shipment figures reflect a lot of machines sitting on stores' shelves. Bolstering that opinion are the discounts of up to 45% currently offered on PS/2s by some IBM retailers. And IBM's share of consumer dollars spent on PCs in the U.S. slipped in 1987 for the third year in a row, to about one-quarter, according to, InfoCorp, a leading independent PC market researcher. StoreBoard Inc., which tracks retail PC sales only, also reports that IBM lost market share in 1987.    &quot;IBM was losing share before the PS/2s were introduced, and it's worse now,&quot; claims Howard Furer, a vice president of InfoCorp. &quot;The clone market is stronger than it has ever been,&quot; he says.    IBM disputes research that says it lost PC market share last year. IBM executives also say the computer industry widely recognizes the Micro Channel's advantages, and they point to frantic efforts to clone it as proof that it is becoming a new PC standard.    Some IBM people bristle at the suggestion the personal computer is becoming a commodity. &quot;This is not whether you're buying Shell or Texaco, or whether you've got MFP or not in the toothpaste,&quot; says William Lowe, the chief of IBM's personal-computer business. &quot;This is a high-investment, technology-driven business that's delivering more applications and more capability to more people every day, and I think there's a big difference.&quot;    Another top IBM marketing strategist is a little skeptical about the difference. He compares IBM's plight with Honda's trying to compete with Toyota and Nissan. &quot;In a world that wants to make these things into commodities, you'd like to have exclusive features,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody wants to get into a price war.&quot; That is a rare perspective from a company that normally insists it designs products to serve customers, not score marketing points.    The Micro Channel isn't a single part. Rather, it is an agglomeration of designs for moving data back and forth from the guts of the PS/2 to its accessories, such as the screen and the disk-drive, and to other computers. IBM says the Micro Channel makes the PS/2 faster and less likely to crash than its old PCs.    A lot of smart computer people have been trying to find out what goes on inside a PS/2. And some of the industry's top engineers say that after spending months poring over the Micro Channel, they haven't found much that customers really need or that IBM rivals can't match.    &quot;It's a lot of FUD,&quot; says Edward Belove, vice president for research and development of software maker Lotus Development Corp., using a high-tech marketing acronym for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. Lotus and IBM each ring up sales when the other designs good products. Nevertheless, Mr. Belove wryly concludes, &quot;The emperor's wearing a bathing suit.&quot;    IBM customers, too, remain mostly befuddled as the Micro Channel nears its first birthday, April 2. It turns out that of the PS/2's thousands of customers, many are buying for the same reason they bought the first IBM PCs: They want the latest goodies of the world's largest computer company. They don't know, or especially care, whether they need the Micro Channel or any other special design.    &quot;We see a definite advantage in the architecture,&quot; declares Rick Pemberton, who helped set up a network of about 200 PS/2s for United Airlines. What advantage? He hesitates and says, &quot;I don't know. I'd have to check.&quot;    More important for many PS/2 buyers are longstanding close ties with IBM. At Ford Motor Co., the owner of some 5,000 PS/2s, computer executive S.I. Gilman speaks fondly of Ford's intimate relationship with IBM. &quot;We call it the 'Ford-IBM Office Automation Alliance,'&quot; he says. As for the Micro Channel, he says: &quot;To us, the value hasn't been clear yet.&quot;    Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. is outfitting all its brokers with PS/2s, but it isn't because of &quot;the hyper-channel and all this kind of stuff,&quot; says DuWayne Peterson, the financial concern's computer chief. Merrill Lynch normally has more than 50 IBM engineers camped out on its premises trouble-shooting its huge array of computers. &quot;That's stuff Compaq couldn't do as far as support,&quot; he says. &quot;You don't walk away from a partner.&quot;    Few high-tech companies have ever touted a specific feature the way IBM is touting the Micro Channel. IBM has stirred alarm among customers by taking out ads that warn, &quot;If you don't buy an IBM PS/2, you'll miss the bus&quot; (the &quot;bus&quot; is the technical word for a data pathway). It has spooked clone-makers by threatening to sue anyone who infringes on the Micro Channel's patents while refusing to say just what those patents protect.    IBM has even been making a celebrity out of Chet Heath, the young, bearded engineer who headed the Micro Channel design team. The company trotted him out at recent PS/2 briefings to speak in front of a big slide with &quot;Micro Channel&quot; in glittering 3-D letters. In the IBM culture, that's like Russia's Politburo begging reporters to write about a hot young party member.    IBM draws the line on too much technical detail, however. Electric-razor users don't feel they have to know all about &quot;the mechanism that drives the blades,&quot; says Mr. Lowe. Also, it is smart business sense not to reveal too much about what the Micro Channel's inner workings really do or what portions of it are patented, he says. &quot;Why should I encourage these people by telling them {how} to copy this thing that I've invested a great deal of money in?&quot; he asks.    Copying, however, may not be as important as it once was. Why bother if customers don't understand the Micro Channel and aren't necessarily buying because of it? Clone-makers can already design machines that run all the same programs as the PS/2, use the same innovative chip and operating-system software -- which outsiders supply -- and do nearly everything else except move data through the celebrated Micro Channel.    If that attitude takes hold, the rules of the PC business may not change much after all. The market will look the way it did in the days of IBM's first PCs: lots of clones, fierce price-cutting, and market-share struggles for IBM.    To some degree, IBM is contributing to the look-alike look. Its PS/2 takes a giant step toward Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh by using the same smaller disks, and later this year, coming out with a similar easy-to-use screen. Just last week Apple indirectly challenged IBM's incursion onto its graphic turf with a lawsuit against Microsoft Corp., IBM's partner in designing the PS/2's new appearance.    Still, IBM over the next few years will be stressing its differences from the pack. It promises to bombard customers with two new PS/2 models a year, a schedule that would even leave auto makers breathless. It will also offer more IBM-only features, such as an operating system it has christened &quot;Extended Edition.&quot;    &quot;If you were to buy an old PC now, you're buying the old architecture at the end of its really active and aggressive life,&quot; says Mr. Lowe. &quot;If you buy the PS/2,&quot; he vows, &quot;then you're buying the beginning of a new generation of machines with a new architecture base that's going to last for a considerably longer period of time.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
