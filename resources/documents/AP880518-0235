The GAO, which conducts investigations for Congress, reports asmall increase in U.S. lending to South Africa early last year.   The office says that in recent years, South Africa has stoppedpublishing details of its foreign trade and that older figures maynot be accurate because of a long history of sanctions. Sanctions,both official and private, have been imposed on South Africa fromabroad because of its race policies.   The GAO put together figures for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,D-Mass., and Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., using other sources,including the U.S. government, the International Monetary Fund andprivate organizations.   The report, dated April 29, was made available to the media thisweek. It gives percentages rather than actual dollar values fortrade.   It shows that West Germany took the place of the United Statesas South Africa's leading supplier in 1984, providing 20.4 percentof South Africa's imports to 19.7 percent for the United States. Bythe first six months of 1987, the German proportion had risen to25.4 percent, Japan's to 18 percent, Britain's to 15.8. The UnitedStates was in fourth place with 13.4 percent.   The United States continued as South Africa's best customeruntil the first half of 1987, the latest period for which the studyhas figures. But in those six months Japan bought 23.8 percent ofSouth Africa's exports, with Italy taking 17.4 percent and theUnited States 12.6 percent.   According to the report, there are conflicting views and littleevidence about South African efforts to avoid sanctions. Althoughworld trade increased substantially in the five years covered,South Africa's trade with 24 major countries decreased.   Comparing the first half of each year from 1982 through 1987, itfinds that South African exports dropped to $5.2 billion from $5.6billion; imports by South Africa decreased to $4.4 billion from$6.4 billion.   ``An economist and U.S. embassy personnel in South Africa statethat South Africa has no need to extensively use sanction-bustingactivities because the sanctions have not had a substantiallyadverse effect on the economy,'' the report says.   It quotes the Shipping Research Bureau, a private organization,as saying that despite embargoes, South Africa can still get mostof the oil it needs, at a higher price.   ``According to the bureau, most of South Africa's oil comes fromPersian Gulf countries that sell the oil to independent oiltraders, who disguise by false documentation that the oil is beingshipped to South Africa,'' it adds.   ``The bureau said it had notified these oil producing countriesthat the independent traders they are dealing with ship some oftheir oil to South Africa, but the countries continue to deal withSouth Africa.''   On lending to South Africa, the report uses information from theCalifornia-Nevada Interfaith Council on Corporate Responsibility.It reports that international lending, including U.S. lending,. toSouth Africa had declined at the end of 1986.   Of a total $22.6 billion borrowed by South Africa, banks inBritain accounted for $3.6 billion, those in the United States for$3 billion, West Germany for $1.9 billion and Switzerland for $1.8billion.   U.S. lending increased marginally in the first six months of1987 to just over $3 billion, the report says, without givingprecise figures.   ``In the light of the ban on most forms of new U.S. lending thattook effect in mid-November 1986, we have not been able to explainthis small increase,'' the report says.   New U.S. investment in South African long-term securities hasdecreased since 1985 _ $36 million worth in 1986 and $13 millionlast year _ despite an increase of $7 million in purchases byAmericans of South African bonds.   The number of U.S. companies withdrawing from South Africa rosefrom 40 in 1985 to 55 in 1987. In the first four months of thisyear, there were only four withdrawals, however. These figures camefrom the U.S. Investor Responsibility Research Center, a privategroup.</TEXT></DOC>
