At the same time it effects comfort and energy consumption forspace heating. The main sources of contaminants giving rise to healtheffects in dwellings were found to be tobacco smoke, some building materialsand under certain conditions, combustion appliances. For indoor pollutantsbeing most important within the work of International Energy Agency'sAnnex IX Minimum Ventilation Rates air exchange rates have been definedwhich prevent (1) damage to the health of occupants, (2) annoyance orreduction in amenity, and (3) damage to the building fabric. Technicalsolutions which can meet the controverse requirements for good indoorair quality and energy conservation have to integrate the following aspects:(1) tight building's envelop, (2) mechanical ventilation with the possibilityto adapt outdoor air supply to demand, (3) inhabitants behavior fittingthese requirements and acceptance of the technology by the inhabitants,(4) heat recovery, and (5) an important key to economical solutions:design and realization of ventilation systems of high efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
