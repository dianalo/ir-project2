Leading opposition figure Aung San Suu Kyi, addressing a crowd ofseveral thousand in the western part of the city, repeated herdenunciations of the ruling military for its refusal to negotiate, awitness said.   Rallies for Ms. Suu Kyi this week, including the largest sinceSeptember, were held despite martial law, which forbids gatheringsof more than five people.   Diplomats have said the price of rice, which has doubled in thepast year, and shortages have prompted more calls for democraticreform in the country the government has renamed Myanmar.   Western diplomats said groups of up to several hundred studentschanted slogans from last year's national uprising and, bearing red``fighting peacock'' flags, dodged armed troops.   Up to a thousand students gathered outside the gates of RangoonUniversity to try to lay a wreath but were forced to turn back byarmed troops, said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Authorities arrested six student demonstrators, saidgovernment-run Radio Rangoon.   Residents said many stayed indoors Friday for fear of violence,and some shops in the city closed during the afternoon. Butwitnesses said the military appeared to be keeping a low profile anddid not attempt to prevent political leaders from speaking.   Ms. Suu Kyi, head of National League for Democracy, spoke duringa ceremony to remember the killings of students after the 1962military coup and those who died during army crackdowns onpro-democracy protests last year.   Dozens of students were killed when the military put down ademonstration at Rangoon University 26 years ago and blew up thestudent union building.   In September, several thousand were killed in a series ofcrackdowns by troops.   Socialist strongman Ne Win is held responsible for ordering thekillings in 1962 and 1988. He officially relinquished control a yearago, but Ms. Suu Kyi repeatedly has said he is the power behindnominal head of state Saw Maung.   ``Gen. Saw Maung and U Ne Win have identical views in theirdisregard for dialogue and civil authority,'' Ms. Suu Kyi told thecrowd Friday.   On Wednesday, Saw Maung insisted Ne Win retired but added: ``Weare all here today because of him, he taught us like a parent.''   Ms. Suu Kyi, has drawn big crowds which have defied martial lawto hear her speak in Rangoon in the past week.   On Wednesday, more than 10,000 Burmese rallied to hear Ms. SuuKyi speak in what Rangoon-based diplomats said was the largestpolitical gathering since September. Diplomats said she addressedmore large crowds Thursday.   ``We want dialogue, not confrontation,'' she told The AssociatedPress Thursday. ``There is room for dialogue. It is a great pitythat he (Saw Maung) appears to have rejected the idea.''   Outside the capital Friday, a bomb exploded at an oil refinery,killing two people, Rangoon Radio reported. There was no immediateclaim of responsibility.</TEXT></DOC>
