Kagan's appearance Monday at Hazelwood's trial set the stage forCousins to give his version of the disaster today.   Cousins, the third mate, explained to jurors the chores heroutinely carried out before sailing.   He depicted the day of the accident as routine in most ways. Hesaid that unlike other members of the crew, he chose not to go intoValdez on a shore excursion during the day. Instead, Cousins saidhe stayed aboard, kept an eye on the loading of oil, and helped topoff the tanks.   The Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef on March 24, spilling morethan 10 million gallons of oil and causing the nation's worst oilspill. The prosecution says Hazelwood was drunk and negligent inturning over control of the ship to Cousins, who was not certifiedto navigate in treacherous Prince William Sound.   Cousins, of Tampa, Fla., took the stand briefly before courtrecessed Monday, saying he had crossed the sound between 26 and 30times and was on the bridge for half of those trips.   Cousins, who testified at hearings before the NationalTransportation Safety Board last year, has blamed the accident on amalfunction of the ship, which he says did not respond to hisrudder changes after he took it off automatic pilot.   Kagan, of Harahan, La., testified after a Coast Guard monitorconceded he didn't even look for the Exxon Valdez on a radarmonitor before the accident because he was told it had disappearedfrom radar.   ``I wasn't looking for him because he had been lost'' fromradar, said Bruce Blandford, a civilian Coast Guard employee, whoindicated he was stunned when Hazelwood called at about 12:25 a.m.to say the 987-foot tanker ``was hard around and leaking oil.''   ``I did a pretty hard swallow ... the adrenaline startedpumping.''   He said he called the commanding officer of the Coast Guardstation and told him ``this was the big one _ the Exxon Valdez wason the rocks leaking oil.''   Hazelwood's defense has suggested that the monitor could haveaverted the grounding by watching the radar more closely andwarning Hazelwood he was off course. But Blandford said he had noauthority to tell a captain to change course.   Kagan told of making course changes repeatedly on orders fromCousins in the final, frantic moments before the crash. First, hesaid they grappled over the switch to remove the ship fromautomatic pilot and go back to manual steering.   ``We both reached for it at the same time,'' he said.   Then, Kagan said, he heard three separate commands to go right,left and then right again and saw Cousins get on the phone,presumably to Hazelwood, who was in his cabin.   In the seconds before grounding, Kagan said, there was a commandto turn hard left and Cousins grabbed the wheel with him in a panic.   Then, he said, he heard ``a little rattle, bumping'' and theship was aground. He said he had no idea of the extent of damageuntil daybreak when he looked in the water and saw ``there was alot of oil around the ship. I was very surprised.''   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felonycount of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges ofreckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating avessel while intoxicated. The maximum penalty for conviction on allcounts is 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.   Regarding Hazelwood's orders after the grounding, Kagan said hecan't be sure whether the captain was trying to move the ship offthe rocks or just stabilize it.   ``I wasn't really sure what he was doing,'' said Kagan.   But in the aftermath, he said Hazelwood commended him. ``He saidI did a hell of a job.''</TEXT></DOC>
