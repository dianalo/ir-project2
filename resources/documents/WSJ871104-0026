Creditors of Texaco are expected to step up pressure on the oil giant either to settle its legal battle with Pennzoil or to file a reorganization plan as quickly as possible, say individuals familiar with the bankruptcy-law proceedings.    &quot;The longer the case remained in the judiciary, the more time the creditors were willing to give Texaco to work things out,&quot; said Dennis O'Dea, counsel for a committee representing shareholders in Texaco's bankruptcy-law proceedings. &quot;But (Monday's) decision will move a lot of people's watches into high speed.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texaco closed down $3.25 a share, at $31, while Pennzoil jumped $10.625, to $65.50.    White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco filed last April 12 for court protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in order to forestall enforcement of the $10.3 billion judgment against it. That judgment arose from Houston, Texas-based Pennzoil's claim that Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. had illegally interfered with a prior Pennzoil contract to acquire part of Getty.    Some creditors say they are concerned that if Pennzoil's $10.3 billion claim is upheld, debt owed them by Texaco might not be fully paid. And if the U.S. Supreme Court refuses to hear Texaco's appeal, a bankruptcy court in a worn out building on a back street in White Plains is the oil giant's last legal forum.    &quot;Until now, it's been a bankruptcy for a special purpose,&quot; said George Wiesz, counsel for the industry creditors committee. &quot;But if the U.S. Supreme Court doesn't hear the case, it could become a real bankruptcy.&quot;    At a news conference yesterday, Texaco Chief Executive Officer James Kinnear attempted to allay creditors' fears by assuring them that Texaco &quot;will continue to meet financial obligations to our creditors.&quot; Flanked by Chairman Alfred DeCrane, Texaco's bankruptcy counsel Harvey Miller and the company's lead litigator David Boies, he added that it was &quot;inconceivable&quot; that Texaco might have to pay the entire $10.3 billion judgment.    &quot;Well, he's going to have to start conceiving of it,&quot; said Jeffrey Hodgman, acting chairman of the general creditors committee, which is expected to meet today with Mr. Kinnear. &quot;I'm really disappointed that there haven't been any meaningful settlement talks to date.&quot;    Mr. Kinnear said that he is still receptive to a settlement and that &quot;lines of communication remain open. We should be able to bring this matter to a reasonable conclusion.&quot; But he said he wasn't going to let the Texas court's &quot;ill considered&quot; decision be the basis for an &quot;extortionary&quot; settlement.    At the meeting scheduled for today with the general creditors committee, Mr. Kinnear said he expects to tell them that rather then pressuring Texaco to settle or reorganize it would be more &quot;appropriate&quot; to put pressure on Pennzoil. Pennzoil has said that it won't settle for less than $4 billion.    Any attempt by Texaco to extend greatly the period during which it has the exclusive right to file its own plan of reorganization would likely be opposed by creditors, sources say. Texaco has that right until Dec. 8. Mr. Miller, Texaco's bankruptcy counsel, said he expects to file a motion during the next two weeks requesting additional time to prepare a reorganization plan. If granted, this would be Texaco's second extension.    At the news conference, Mr. Miller said Texaco isn't yet working on a clear reorganization plan because the issue is still &quot;too amorphous.&quot; &quot;How can you fashion a plan until you know what settlement&quot; will cost, he said.    Last Friday, Charles Luce, chairman of the general creditors committee, informed Mr. Kinnear that he was opposed to any long-term extension, say individuals familiar with the bankruptcy-law proceedings. The general creditors committee has been working on its own reorganization plan, but it's unclear whether it would be ready by the Dec. 8 deadline, sources say.    And in light of the Texas court's refusal to hear Texaco's appeal &quot;there will be an attempt by all creditors to unite and press for termination of further exclusivity for Texaco,&quot; said an adviser of a creditors' committee. &quot;We'll come up with our own plan and cram it down Texaco's throat.&quot;    Meanwhile, a plan to pay most of Texaco's creditors while the oil giant remains in bankruptcy-law proceedings has become entangled.    Texaco, expected to file by last week a motion calling for interim distribution payments, appears to have backed away from the plan. But the general creditors committee, frustrated by Texaco's inaction, may move on the proposal without the oil giant, say individuals familiar with the case.    Under the interim distribution plan, most of Texaco's creditors would be paid and interest payments to lenders resumed. Pennzoil, which wouldn't receive any payments because its claim is disputed, says its interests would be &quot;isolated&quot; from other creditors'.    The general creditors committee was prepared to file its own motion Monday, but a last-minute appeal by Texaco stayed its hand, sources say. In a letter received Saturday by representatives of the general creditors committee, Texaco's bankruptcy counsel Mr. Miller advised that although Texaco still &quot;supports&quot; the concept of interim distribution, the timing isn't appropriate.    The general creditors committee is meeting today with Texaco officials to discuss why the oil giant has so far failed to file the proposal with the bankruptcy court. Based upon the answers it gets, it will decide whether to go ahead and file for interim distribution on its own, sources say.    Separately, in New York, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its ratings on about $8.2 billion of Texaco and related-company debt, in view of the Texas Supreme Court's refusal to hear the appeal of the Pennzoil judgment.    The ratings concern said the decision &quot;eliminated one more level of relief for Texaco in the litigation.&quot; Texaco securities were downgraded to Ca from Caa. </TEXT></DOC>
