The passengers, mostly women and children, arrived on a ZambianAirways DC-10 from Lusaka, Zambia. After immigration formalities atthe airport, they will be reunited with their families and sent totheir home villages.   Officials say it will cost $39 million to bring the refugees backfor the election campaign, which begins July 1, and the Novemberelections. Both will be held under a U.N.-sponsored peace treatygranting te Namibia independence.   One U.N. official, Nicolas Bwakira, said the refugees whoreturned today were ``in good health and they are all very happy.''   Many Namibians fled their homeland to Angola and Zambia over theyears to escape the bush war for control of Namibia. Under aregional peace treaty signed in December, South Africa agreed to endits 74-year rule of the territory in return for Cuba withdrawing itsestimated 50,000 troops from Angola where they fought alongsidegovernment forces.   U.N. officials had expected 1,300 refugees to arrive today inWindhoek and at northern Namibian air bases in Ondanga andGrootfontein.   But one flight from Luanda, Angola, to Grootfontein wasreportedly canceled, and the officials said only 700 arrivals wereexpected today. Two planes carrying refugees' belongings were toarrive from Angola and Zambia.   The first refugee to disembark from the Zambian plane was a17-year-old. He was greeted on the tarmac at Windhoek InternationalAirport by Bwakira, who asked him if he was glad to be back.   ``I'm glad to be home, yes,'' said the boy.   Several of the young men sang freedom songs as they walked towardthe terminal building. The two dozen children on the plane carriedblankets and orange-colored plates and cups given to them in Zambia.   The United Nations has registered 41,000 Namibian exiles _ mostof them in Angola and Zambia _ who want to return home. In additionto the airlift, hundreds of refugees are crossing the border fromAngola on foot, Namibian officials have said.   Most exiles are supporters or members of the South-West AfricanPeople's Organization, which fought a 23-year guerrilla war againstSouth African control of Namibia.   As the Zambian Airways plane landed, 200 people dressed in theSWAPO colors of blue, red and green chanted slogans supporting theSWAPO guerrilla fighters.   Namibians who turned out to greet the refugees held up bannersreading: ``Welcome Home SWAPO Freedom Fighters.''   SWAPO is favored to win November elections, but they will need atwo-thirds' majority in order to control the new government. Noformal date has been set for independence but it will likely beearly next year.   The arlift was delayed for a month, when an unscheduled bordercrossing by hundreds of SWAPO fighters interrupted the peace plan onApril 1, the day it was to begin.   More than 300 SWAPO fighters, and 27 security force officialsdied in the subsequent fighting, until SWAPO recalled the fightersto Angola.   Further delays were caused by disagreements over an amnesty forexiles accused of crimes before the left and the repeal ofdiscriminatory legislation that might affect free and fair elections.</TEXT></DOC>
