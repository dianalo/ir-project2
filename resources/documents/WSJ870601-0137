StewartStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> UCL GESTOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Unocal Corp. agreed to delay proceedings against Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. in its $2.5 billion lawsuit against Goldman, Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. and four persons involved in Wall Street's insider-trading scandal for allegedly leaking information about Unocal's 1985 takeover defense against Mesa Petroleum Co.    Unocal said it is negotiating about a possible delay with Kidder and the four individuals.    Unocal and Goldman said they agreed to take no action in the case for at least 90 days, beginning May 14. During that time, the two are expected to exchange documents in an informal discovery process that Goldman hopes will persuade Unocal to drop the case, people familiar with the proceedings said. Either side can terminate the agreement if the discovery process breaks down or at the end of the 90 days.    Unocal filed its suit in April, shortly after Goldman's head of arbitrage, Robert Freeman, was indicted for alleged insider trading and charged with leaking details of the Los Angeles-based holding company's defense to former Kidder investment banker Martin A. Siegel. Both Messrs. Freeman and Siegel are named in Unocal's suit, which seeks nearly $2.5 billion in damages, including $1.5 billion in punitive damages against Goldman. The suit charges breach of contract and fiduciary duty, fraud, negligence and conspiracy.    In May, all criminal charges against Mr. Freeman and two others named in Unocal's suit, former Kidder arbitragers Richard B. Wigton and Timothy L. Tabor, were dropped at the request of the U.S. attorney. The government has said it will seek a new indictment of the three containing broader charges than were contained in the indictment that was dismissed.    Dennis Codon, a Unocal attorney, said Unocal is &quot;not backing off. We're simply putting ourselves in a position where we're exchanging documents and getting a better assessment of the case.&quot;    Lawyers not involved in the case noted that proceedings in Unocal's civil case probably would have been delayed in any event because of the possibility that they might interfere with the pending criminal investigation of Messrs. Freeman, Wigton and Tabor.    A Goldman spokesman declined to comment beyond the investment banking firm's statement announcing the agreement. A Kidder spokesman declined to comment. Lawyers for the four individuals have consistently declined to comment on the Unocal suit.    At the time the charges were filed, Goldman said it believed Unocal's claims were &quot;frivolous and totally without merit.&quot; Goldman repeatedly has said that it has conducted a thorough internal investigation that exonerated Mr. Freeman and found no wrongdoing by the firm or any of its employees. </TEXT></DOC>
