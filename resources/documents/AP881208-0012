The winning design for the privately funded project that willcost up to $45 million was unveiled this week by a blue-ribboncommittee appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley.   The winning entry, called ``clouds of steel,'' follows thedeconstructivism movement of modern architecture in which buildingsseem to lack symmetry.   It was designed by New York architects Hani Rashid and Lise AnneCouture, whose mission was to create a structure to celebrate LosAngeles' ethnic diversity.   ``It looks like a freeway that just blew up, or after anearthquake,'' said City Councilwoman Gloria Molina of the monumentthat would straddle the Hollywood Freeway. ``This is too strange forLos Angeles to ever appreciate it or grow to like.''   Councilman Ernani Bernardi is concerned motorists will pay moreattention to the monument, a conglomeration of twisted steel, thanto driving. ``I think it will be a terrible hazard,'' he said.   ``We have to be open to possibilities,'' argued former Gov.Edmund G. Brown Jr. ``People are always laughing at innovation. Artis what isn't. It is creation.''   Michael Rotondi, director of the Southern California Institute ofArchitecture and one of 13 members of the international selectioncommittee, conceded many on the panel had never been to Los Angeles.   But, he said, they are ``some of the most forward thinkers inarchitecture. Even if they haven't been to Los Angeles, they knowthe work of Los Angeles.''</TEXT></DOC>
