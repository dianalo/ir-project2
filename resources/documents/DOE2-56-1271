Strains resultingin the appearance of the edge effect deformations are considered. Certainpossible schemes of local deformation of vessel power equipment are revealed.It is shown that it is local dynamic deformations of thin-wall shellelements that can produce the determining contribution in the evaluationof power equipment strength under seismic effects.</TEXT></DOC>
