The National Taxpayers Union said former Rep. Ben Reifel willreceive a September pension check for $6,966, giving him more than$1 million since he retired from Congress in 1971. The South DakotaRepublican served five terms in the House and receives $83,589annually, the group said.   In May, former Republican Sen. Margaret Chase Smith became thefirst senator to get a millionaire pension, said David Keating,executive vice president of the taxpayers group.   ``While most Americans can only dream of a million dollars inretirement income, dozens of retired legislators will soon becomepension millionaires,'' Keating said in a news release.   The group said Mrs. Smith's annual pension is $88,715. Sheretired in 1973 after more than 30 years in Congress and hasreceived $1,034,914 in retirement benefits, according to the group.   In November, former Tennessee Sen. Albert A. Gore will receive acheck putting him over the $1 million mark, the group said. Heretired in 1971 after 32 years in the House and Senate and receivesan annual pension of $81,347.   Reifel, Gore and Mrs. Smith each made $42,500 during their lastyear in Congress. Current congressional salary is $89,500.Congressional retirement pay is derived from a formula thatincludes the average congressional salary over the last three years.   The group said a proposed increase in congressional pay to$135,000 next year would greatly increase the number ofmillion-dollar pensions.   The taxpayers union, a non-profit organization that says it has150,000 members interested in reducing government spending andtaxes, estimates that for every dollar paid in congressionalsalaries, 35 cents is paid in congressional pension benefits.   It says 85 percent of the retirement funds come from generalrevenue because the 8 percent that representatives and senators payinto their retirement fund is not enough to cover the benefits.   Meanwhile, consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said he was sending aletter to all members of Congress on Labor Day reminding them thatthe national minimum wage has not increased in seven years, whiletheir own salaries have gone up $28,838.   ``Congress' reluctance to adjust the minimum wage isparticularly surprising in light of the diligence it has shown inraising its own pay,'' Nader said in the letter made public Sunday.   Nader noted that a worker earning the minimum wage of $3.53 anhour would earn $6,960 annually, which is $4,600 below the povertylevel for a family of four.</TEXT></DOC>
