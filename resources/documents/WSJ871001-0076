Hours before the arguments begin, lawyers and aides representing outside investors will begin circling. They will stake out choice seats near the exit and plot escape routes to nearby telephones. Once the hearing begins, they will hang on the judge's every word.    A decision -- if there is one -- will set off a scramble with participants using feints, dodges and sprints worthy of a football kickoff returner.    So it goes at Delaware's tiny Court of Chancery, where the atmosphere isn't as chummy and genteel as it used to be. Nowadays, the court is asked constantly to resolve high-stakes takeover disputes. In the process, merger mania has taken a toll on manners. Among the throngs of messengers and other hangers-on who feed on the court's decisions, the fashionable attitude seems to be that might makes right, or at least that polite folks never finish first.    &quot;If I can get information to my clients before the public has that knowledge, then my clients make a killing,&quot; explains lawyer Daniel Losco. &quot;You get away with whatever you can.&quot;    Lately, the mob tries to get away with a lot. Some use assistants to monopolize public telephones. Others attempt to trick judges' secretaries into providing advance information. At least one judge suspects that an enterprising snoop sifted through the trash can in the judges' chambers.    Not surprisingly, Chancery Court officials aren't especially fond of the changes. Clerks and secretaries in the otherwise homey court say they resent the pushy fact hounds who barrage them with requests. Until a recent crackdown in the clerk's office downstairs, &quot;they'd push and shove each other and shout at us,&quot; says Patti Flinn, a staff member. &quot;We couldn't leave anything lying around. They'd steal it right out of our hands.&quot;    Because of the size of the crowd, Vice Chancellor Jack B. Jacobs has had to move today's hearing on the Newmont dispute from his tiny state courtroom to larger quarters in the federal courthouse down the street. Last week, annoyed by all the people milling around during an earlier Newmont hearing, the judge ordered that no one could leave his courtroom until he finished delivering his opinion.    The lawyers, who mainly work for Wall Street arbitragers, pursue every scrap of information that might help their clients capture fast profits by trading ahead of the pack. Most make no apology for their zeal. &quot;We're Keystone Kops in pinstripes,&quot; acknowledges Clark Furlow, a local lawyer who has become a courthouse regular.    Delaware's liberal business laws and the Chancery Court's reputation for speed and competence have brought it a disproportionate number of corporate feuds. When the takeover and merger craze exploded in the early 1980s, big-time investors and speculators took an even greater interest in legal doings here. Local lawyers answered the demand for instant information and analysis.    Members of this fraternity within a fraternity thrive on the peculiar nature of proceedings in the Chancery Court. Corporate litigants ask for swift delivery of orders that block hostile raiders or sweep aside management defenses. This kind of judicial intervention usually prompts immediate Wall Street reactions. With early warning, speculators can make big profits on even small stock movements.    For example, when Judge Jacobs made a crucial ruling in the Newmont case Sept. 23, the stock fell $2.25 a share to close at $92.75 and was the fifth most active issue traded on the New York Stock Exchange that day. The judge issued an order that temporarily restrained certain Newmont maneuvers designed to thwart a hostile bid by Texas oil man T. Boone Pickens Jr.    While many of Mr. Losco's competitors rushed for the three public phones in the building, he ran for the front door. Standing on the courthouse steps, he threw both arms straight up in the air, looking like a football referee signaling a touchdown. Across the street, keeping her vigil at the window of an 18th-floor office, his secretary understood the pre-arranged signal and conveyed it to New York clients on the other end of an open phone line.    &quot;Touchdown meant TRO (temporary restraining order) granted,&quot; explains Mr. Losco. &quot;I'm sure I beat everybody.&quot;    Not necessarily. Technology has made such inroads that hand signals and conventional telephones may no longer be quick enough. A couple of years ago, some lawyers began sprouting walkie-talkie antennas, enabling them to duck out of Chancery Court hearings and instantly communicate with colleagues at the office.    Cellular telephones have become increasingly popular, especially since the Texaco-Pennzoil court battles of 1986. At least one Wilmington lawyer claims he calls his contacts surreptitiously from inside the courtroom, never having to leave his seat.    Those relying on more traditional methods can be at a disadvantage. Lawyer Robert Katzenstein prepared for the release of an important written opinion in the Newmont case recently by having an assistant monopolize a public phone in the court clerk's office. Angered by the strategem, a court employee ousted Mr. Katzenstein and his accomplice. &quot;I apologized profusely and accepted my censure,&quot; he says. &quot;We need to be friendly with the people who have the documents.&quot;    Mr. Katzenstein says ruefully that at age 36, he may already be getting too old for O.J. Simpson-style sprints through courthouse corridors. &quot;Ideally, you'd be in better shape than I am,&quot; he concedes.    For some others, even speed in the hallways isn't enough of an advantage. Court staff employees and several lawyers report that last year one lawyer bamboozled a judge's secretary into surrendering an unreleased opinion in an important takeover battle. The lawyer convinced the secretary that the clerk's office had directed her to distribute the opinion.    &quot;He had it for a full 20 minutes before the others caught on, and they were as mad as I've ever seen these guys,&quot; says Ms. Flinn of the clerk's office.    In response to such excesses, the court has attempted to reign in the lawyers. Employees are under orders to guard documents diligently, and the judges are planning to hire a receptionist. &quot;We're a small court -- four judges with one law clerk and a secretary each,&quot; says Judge Jacobs. &quot;We're just not equipped to handle the massive onslaught of requests.&quot;    In the basement clerk's office, known formally as the Register in Chancery, an informal code of punishment has developed. Now, whenever the lawyers misbehave, Ms. Flinn says she and her colleagues take ever so long to complete routine tasks. &quot;Before giving documents out,&quot; she explains with a smile, &quot;we look them over real close.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
