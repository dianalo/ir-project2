Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from July 17, 1989 through July 28, 1989 (54 FR 31097). Thelast biweekly notice was published on July 26, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By September 8, 1989 the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filedby the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety andLicensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and theSecretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issuea notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Arkansas Power andamp; Light Company, Docket No. 50-313, Arkansas NuclearOne, Unit 1, Pope County, Arkansas </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>June 16, 1988 as supplemented on April27, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise the Technical Specification surveillance test frequency requirementsfor the radiation monitoring system. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an Operating License for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Arkansas Power and Light Company (APandamp;L) has reviewed the proposed changeand has determined that: (1) The proposed change would not increase theprobability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated sinceit does not affect previously analyzed accidents associated with plantoperations and does not affect any information required to safely shutdown the plant; (2) the proposed change would not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed sincethe change does not allow the instrumentation to be operated in any newor different way from what is currently allowed; and (3) the proposed changewould not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety sinceit does not impact plant operation or involve any plant modifications.Therefore, APandamp;L has determined that the requested changes do not involvea significant hazards consideration. The proposed amendment would change Technical Specification Table 4.1-1regarding Item 28, ``Radiation Monitoring System other than containmenthigh range monitors.'' The ``Channel Description'' would be changed toidentify two subparts of the Radiation Monitoring System: Process MonitoringSystem and Area Monitoring System. Each subpart would have separate surveillancetest frequencies specified. The channel check frequency for both subpartswould be increased to once per shift from once per week. The channel functionaltest frequency for the Process Monitoring System would be decreased frommonthly to quarterly, and would remain monthly for the Area MonitoringSystem. Finally the channel calibration frequency for both subparts wouldbe decreased to once per 18 months from once per quarter. These proposed surveillance frequencies are consistent with the RadiologicalEffluent Monitoring Instrumentation Technical Specifications, which requirea quarterly channel functional test and a channel calibration every 18months. They are also identical to the Radiation Monitoring System surveillancefrequencies specified in the Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 2, Technical Specifications,which are consistent with the Combustion Engineering Standardized FormatTechnical Specifications and the channel calibration frequency (duringrefueling outages) indicated in Section 12.3 of the Standard Review Plan.Additionally, the decrease in the channel calibration frequency to onceevery 18 months is justified by a significant record of reliable instrumentperformance. Based on the above, the staff concludes that these proposed changes donot (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Thereforethe staff proposes to determine that the requested changes do not involvea significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Tomlinson Library, ArkansasTech University, Russellville, Arkansas 72801 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esq., Bishop, Cook,Purcell, andamp; Reynolds, 1400 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-3502<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Frederick J. Hebdon <ITAG tagnum="84">Carolina Power andamp; Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-325 and50-324, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, Brunswick County,North Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>March 29, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The amendments will implementexpanded operating domains for both Brunswick units. The expansion of theoperating domain allows the fuel cycle economics to be enhanced throughimplementation of flow control spectral shift operation and increased coreflow coast down capability. The amendment for each unit is divided into three categories of changes.Category one changes are as follows: Delete the flow-biased APRM scram and rod block trip setpoint setdown requirements,delete reference to the k<T2>f</T2> flow adjustment factor, introduce power and flow dependent adjustmentsto the average planar linear heat generation rate (APLHGR) and minimumcritical power ratio (MCPR) limits, and delete the definitions of the fractionof rated thermal power (FRTP) and the core maximum average planar linearheat generation rate ratio (CMAPRAT). Category two changes modify the flow-biased average power range monitors(APRM) scram and rod block trip equations to accommodate an expanded operatingdomain. Category three changes modify the rod block monitor (RBM) tripsetpoints and RBM system operability requirements. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazard consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazard consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Aproposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee provided the following analysis for Category 1 changes tosupport a no significant hazards consideration determination. <ITAG tagnum="21">1. Changes in the operating limit values will maintain existing marginsbetween the operating limit and the safety limit. Operation within theoperating limit will ensure that the consequences of any accident whichcould occur would be within acceptable limits. There will be no impacton the probability of any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changeidentifies that adjustments to the MCPR and APLHGR limits as specifiedin the Core Operating Limits Report will be made as functions of core flowand power. These adjustments as specified in the Core Operating LimitsReport are determined using NRC approved methods as required by TechnicalSpecification 6.9.3.2. The adjustments impose restrictive conditions onplant operation such that the consequences of anticipated operational occurrencesare no more severe than the most limiting condition with the current TechnicalSpecifications with flow-biased APRM scram and rod block setpoint setdownprovisions. Thus, there is no significant change in the consequences ofany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed change eliminates the requirement for setdown of theflow-biased APRM scram and rod block trip setpoints under specified conditionsand substitutes adjustments to the MCPR and APLHGR operating limits. TheMCPR and APLHGR operating limits are defined such that no postulated transientevent, if initiated from other than rated power or flow conditions, couldresult in violation of either the safety limit MCPR or the fuel thermal-mechanicaldesign bases. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The flow and power adjustment factors were determined using NRCapproved methods and satisfy the same NRC approved criteria met by analysesassuming setdown of the flow-biased APRM scram and rod block setpoints.Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety. </ITAG>The licensee provided the following analysis for Category 2 changes tosupport a no significant hazards consideration determination: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed change expands the power and flow operating domainby relaxing the restrictions imposed by the formulation of the flow-biasedAPRM rod block and scram trip setpoints. The probability of any accidentis not significantly increased by operating at a higher power at a lowercore flow because the formulation of the flow-biased APRM rod block tripequation has been notified to provide the same protection as currentlyexists. The consequences of anticipated operational occurrences have beenevaluated using NRC approved methods and the proposed setpoint formulationshave been selected so as not to involve a significant increase in the consequencesof any accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Changing the formulation for the flow-biased APRM rod block andscram trip setpoints does not change their respective functions. The APRMrod block trip setpoint will continue to block control rod withdrawal whencore power significantly exceeds design bases and approaches the scramlevel. The APRM scram trip setpoint will continue to initiate a scram ifthe power/flow condition exceeds that specified by the APRM rod block setpoint.Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. As stated above, the flow-biased APRM rod block and scram tripsetpoints will continue to perform their respective functions. Therefore,the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. </ITAG>The licensee provided the following analysis for Category 3 changes tosupport a no significant hazards consideration determination. <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The RBM system is not involved in the initiation of any accidentand does not increase the probability of the occurrence of any accident.The RBM system only serves to mitigate the consequences of one event; therod withdrawal error (RWE) anticipated operational occurrence. Analysesof the RWE were performed using NRC approved methods for the modified setpoints.The results demonstrate that the consequences of the RWE event are no moresevere with the modified RBM system than with the current configuration.Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increasein the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed change does not alter the function of any componentor system other than the RBM system. The changes to the RBM system havebeen designed to enhance the reliability and accuracy of the RBM systemwithout impacting the degree of isolation of the RBM system from otherplant systems. The function of the RBM system does not change. Therefore,the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed change revises the setpoints for the RBM system whichis solely designed to mitigate the consequences of the RWE anticipatedoperational occurrence. Analyses of the RWE event are used to derive thesetpoints such that the safety limit for the minimum critical power ratio(MCPR) will not be challenged assuming the initial MCPR was no less thanthe operating limit MCPR. These setpoints are therefore dependent uponthe operating limit MCPR. For this reason, the proposed change also identifiesthat these setpoints are specified in the Core Operating Limits Report.The Core Operating Limits Report is prepared based on the results of NRCapproved methods as required by Technical Specification 6.9.3.2. The setpointsreported in the Core Operating Limits Report are derived such that theRWE event is not the most limiting event in determining the operating limitMCPR. The operating limit MCPR maintains the margin of safety for thisthermal limit. Thus, the proposed change does not involve a significantreduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's no significanthazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.In addition, the staff has reviewed NEDC-31654P, ``Maximum Extended OperatingDomain Analysis for Brunswick Steam Electric Plant,'' which was enclosedas part of the licensee's March 29, 1989 submittal. The staff has verifiedthat the transients which have been considered potentially limiting inthe Brunswick Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, Chapter 15, have beenreanalyzed using the proposed maximum extended operating domain conditions.The purpose of the transient reanalysis, using an NRC-approved methodology,is to ensure that the limits of the safety analysis are maintained. Theresults of the analysis, as documented in NEDC-36154P, show that the safetylimit MCPR has not been exceeeded. Based on this finding, the staff agreeswith the licensee that for Category one changes, the proposed requestedamendment will not increase the consequences of an accident previouslyevaluated. Furthermore, the staff finds that the operation in the maximumextended operating domains for both Brunswick Units has no effect on theprobability of occurrence of any transients because plant equipment andsystems still operate within their design limits. Accordingly, the Commissionproposes to determine that the requested amendment does not involve a significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of North Carolinaat Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S.

Adensam <ITAG tagnum="84">Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 50-254 and 50-265, Quad CitiesNuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2, Rock Island County, Illinois </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>May 25, 1989 <T3>Description of amendments request: </T3>Commonwealth Edison Company(CECo) has proposed amending Sections 3.5.C andamp; E (including applicableBases) of the Technical Specifications (TS) in Appendix A of the Quad CitiesOperating Licenses, DPR-29 and DPR-30. These amendments would revise certainLimiting Conditions of Operability (LCO) and Surveillance requirementsassociated with the High Pressure Core Injection (HPCI) and Reactor CoreIsolation Cooling (RCIC) systems. The general purpose of CECo's proposedTS revision is to conform Quad Cities' LCO and surveillance requirementswith those of the Standard TS for General Electric Boiling Water Reactors,NUREG-0123, Revision 3. Specific TS changes proposed by CECo as part oftheir amendment application are as follows: (1) Expand HPCI/RCIC LCO applicability to include whenever fuel is in thereactor vessel; increase the required Reactor Pressure for HPCI operabilityfrom 90 psig to 150 psig; and delete requirement for HPCI andamp; RCIC operabilityprior to reactor startup from cold shutdown. (2) Extend allowed out-of-service time (i.e. inoperability) for HPCI andamp;RCIC during reactor operation to 14 days (versus 7-days). (3) Establish time limits for continued reactor startup following an outage,in which work was performed that directly affected HPCI andamp; RCIC operability,until HPCI andamp; RCIC are proven operable. (4) Delete the surveillance requirement for immediately demonstrating operabilityof other Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) subsystems whenever HPCIor RCIC are inoperable - require instead a verification of ECCS subsystemsoperability rather than demonstration. (5) Expand surveillance requirements of HPCI andamp; RCIC to test pump flowrates at low and rated reactor pressures. Replace the monthly valve operabilitycheck with a monthly valve lineup check, and delete the monthly pump operabilitycheck. (6) Change required reactor pressure to be reduced to during orderly shutdowndue to HPCI or RCIC inoperability from 90 psig to 150 psig. (7) Revise applicable BASES as appropriate. (8) Delete the obsolete RCIC LCO that was only applicable from November6 through November 20, 1976. All of the aforementioned TS changes are consistentwith Standard TS language, industry operating practices, and existing QCNPSdesign considerations. (9) Expand HPCI/RCIC LCO applicability to whenever fuel is in the reactorvessel. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Commonwealth has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined thatit involves no significant hazards consideration. In accordance with thecriteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c): <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The proposed change does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG>The proposed amendment requires HPCI to be operable at greater than 150psig which is in conformance to design requirements and allows approximatelya 175 psi overlap with the low pressure core cooling subsystems injectioncapabilities at approximately 325 psig. The deletion of the requirementfor HPCI and RCI to be operable prior to reactor startup from a cold shutdownprovides clarification of intent until the reactor is producing steam ata pressure sufficient to provide water injection to the reactor. This clarificationof intent does not reduce the availability of either the HPCI or the RCICsystems when needed to perform their design function. The proposed changefor reduction of reactor pressure from 90 to 150 psig for RCIC inoperabilityrequirement is made to provide consistency with the reactor pressure of150 psig presently allowed in the RCIC operability requirements. The changefor both HPCI and RCIC in the allowed out-of-service time from 7 to 14days, reflects an adoption of later BWR operating plant requirements atQuad Cities for these systems. The 14 day out-of-service period reflectsthe low probability of the need for the systems and also reflects the availabilityof high and low pressure core cooling systems for post accident mitigationfunctions. The deletion of the term irradiated from the system operabilityrequirements is conservative and does not reduce system availability. <ITAG tagnum="21">Proposed changes in testing requirements for HPCI and RCIC includedeletion of the testing of other core cooling systems when HPCI or RCICis inoperable. The present testing methods represent requirements beyondthose necessary to adequately assure that remaining core cooling systemsare operable and capable of performing their design intent. The proposeddeletion of this multiple system testing requirement will bring Quad CitiesUnits 1 and 2 in line with current BWR plant testing requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The remaining changes to HPCI and RCIC requirements involve inclusionof Inservice Testing Program requirements where applicable and StandardPlant testing quidelines. These changes include deletion of monthly pumpand valve operability tests but also include addition of monthly valvelineup checks and a new pump flow test to be conducted under certain startupconditions. The changes to the testing requirements will enhance determinationof system operability by providing both a low and high pressure demonstrationof pump performance. The quarterly pump performance tests have been demonstratedat later plants to provide assurance of system operability and thus thepresent monthly pump operability test can be deleted. The proposed monthlyvalve lineup checks have also been shown through use at other facilitiesto provide assurance of system alignment and thus the monthly valve operabilitychecks can be deleted. The Quad Cities Inservice Testing Program also providesassurance of valve operability and pump performance where applicable. Flowrate testing of HPCI and RCIC is performed prior to exceeding 325 psigfollowing a refueling outage or an outage in which work was performed thatdirectly affected system operability. Selection of the 325 psig limit fortesting ensures stable reactor conditions during the test. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The deletion of the one-time exemption in the RCIC LCO for Quad CitiesUnit 1 is strictly an administrative change and does not affect any accidentanalysis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes do not affect any accident precursors and, therefore,do not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated. Thechanges in HPCI and RCIC Operability requirements reflect system design,assure system operability when required, and provide sufficient overlapwith low pressure core cooling systems. The changes in testing requirementsrepresent deletion of outdated requirements while implementing provisionsthat will provide assurance of system operability and, therefore, the changesdo not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes do not modify HPCI or RCIC design or reduce thecapability of these systems to perform their design intent. The proposedchanges in testing implement the provisions of the Inservice Testing Programwhere applicable in the Technical Specifications and follow proven implementationat other operating BWR plants. Even though the testing intervals are relaxedin some places, this relaxation has been demonstrated at other facilities,with similar systems to those at Quad Cities Units 1 and 2, to provideadequate demonstration of component and system operability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since HPCI and RCIC system design basis are not changed by the proposedchanges, there is no possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction inthe margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment will not significantly reduce the availabilityof HPCI or RCIC when required to mitigate accident conditions. Excessivetesting of systems and components can reduce rather than increase reliability.An acceptable level of testing to demonstrate operability currently beingused at later BWR plants does not include multiple testing of other systemswhen HPCI or RCIC is inoperable. The testing that will remain in the TechnicalSpecifications provides adequate assurance of system performance. Changesto HPCI and RCIC system testing requirements include adoption of proventesting methods at other plants, inclusion of applicable IST program requirements,and inclusion of plant specific testing requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Changes to the operability requirements for HPCI and RCIC are madeto recognize design parameters and to provide consistency in operabilityand shutdown provisions. Actual system operating overlap with the low pressurecore cooling systems has not changed since actual system design flow andpressure ability has not been modified. Adoption of the 14-day allowedout-of-service period does not significantly affect the accident mitigationfunction of the overall core cooling network. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes follow similar provisions that are implementedat BWR plants with systems like those at Quad Cities Units 1 and 2. Sincethe proposed changes will help to assure availability of the HPCI and RCICsystems when required by accident analysis, these changes do not involvea significant reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that this amendment requestdoes not involve significant hazards consideration based upon a preliminaryreview of the application, the licensee's evaluation of no significanthazards, and NRC guidance. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Dixon Public Library, 221Hennepin Avenue, Dixon, Illinois 61021. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Michael I.

Shemanski <ITAG tagnum="84">Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company and Northeast Nuclear EnergyCompany, et al, Docket No. 50-213, Haddam Neck Plant, Middlesex County,Connecticut; Docket No. 50-423, Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No.3, New London County, Connecticut </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>June 29, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendments wouldchange Technical Specifications (TS) 4.10.1.D.1.h for the Haddam Neck Plantand TS 4.4.5.4.a.8 for Millstone Unit 3. The proposed change to the TSwould allow the licensees to inspect steam generator tubes by insertionof the ultrasonic test probe from the cold leg side of the steam generatortube. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>Millstone Unit 3 and Haddam Neck utilize a steam generator tube designshaped as an inverted ``U''. These steam generator tubes traverse the steamgenerator from the hot leg to the cold leg side of steam generator tubesheet. Steam generator tubes are periodically subjected to ultrasonic testing(UT) to detect flaws in the tubes. The testing is accomplished by insertinga probe into the tube. At the present time, TS 4.4.5.4.a.8 and 4.10.1.D.1.hdefine a steam generator tube inspection as ``...an inspection of the steamgenerator tube from the point of entry (hot leg side) completely aroundthe U Bend to the top support of the cold leg.'' The licensees have proposedthat the definition of tube inspection be expanded to also include: ``fromthe point of entry (hot leg or cold leg side) completely around the U-bendto the opposite tube end.'' Title 10 CFR 50.92, ``Issuance of amendment,'' contains standards for determiningif a proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.In this regard, the proposed change to TS 4.4.5.4.a.8 and 4.10.1.D.1.hwould not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The purpose of steam generator tubeinspections is to locate flaws that could potentially result in a steamgenerator tube rupture. The proposed change to the TS would maintain theability of the licensee to identify steam generator tube flaws and takepreventive measures to limit the probability of a steam generator tuberupture. Since the intent of the required steam generator tube inspectionhas not been changed, there is no impact on the probability or consequencesof a steam generator tube rupture accident. The proposed change to the TS would not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident. The use of UT for steam generator tubesis an established form of inspection that has no adverse effects on thetubes. The proposed change to the TS does not involve a change in the testmethod, and retains inspection of the hot leg and U-bend sections of thetubes. Probe entry point (hot leg vs. cold leg) will become optional. Thechoice of entry side has no adverse effect on inspection capability orresults. Finally, the proposed change to the TS would not involve a significantreduction in a margin of safety. Because of the large number of steam generatortubes, the surface area of the tubes represents a substantial fractionof the total primary system boundary area. Thus, steam generator tube integrityis an important part of the overall primary system integrity. The locationand repair of excessive steam generator tube degradation will retain themargin of safety with regard to primary system integrity. Based upon the above, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposedchange to TS 4.4.5.4.a.8 and 4.10.1.D.1.h involves no significant hazardsconsiderations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Russel Library, 123 BroadStreet, Middletown, Connecticut 06457 and Waterford Public Library, 49Rope Ferry Road, Waterford, Connecticut 06385. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499.<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F.

TS 4.8.2 currently specifiesleakage testing of the MSSVs at 59 psig during each refueling outage. Thespecification limits leakage to 25 cubic feet per hour. The apparent basisfor the leak rate is for the use of the MSSVs as containment isolationvalves in the unlikely event of a simultaneous break of the reactor coolantline and a steam generator feedwater header. The technical basis for theallowable leakage of 25 cubic feet per hour is 25% of the total allowablecontainment leakage from all penetrations and isolation valves. The acceptancecriteria used in the performance test of the MSSVs measure water leakagethrough the valve seat. This leak rate is not corrected for an equivalentsteam/air specific volume. Through a detailed review and engineering evaluation, the licensee hasdetermined that leak testing of the MSSVs is unnecessary in order to determinethe operability of these valves and that the basis for the leak rate testingrequirement specified by 4.8.2 is inappropriate. The proposed amendmentswould delete the leak rate testing specified in TS 4.8.2. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards (10 CFR 50.92(c)) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists.

The proposed changes also revise the current definitionof review significant items and resolve a conflict with the existing regulatoryrequirements related to the submission of reports to the NRC. In Section 1 the licensee propose a change in the definition of ``ReviewSignificant.'' The definition currently defines review significant itemsas those system operating procedures and associated emergency, abnormal,alarm response procedures which require NRC approval. The licensee proposesto change the definition to state specifically the procedures which stillrequire NRC approval. License amendment No. 30, dated May 27, 1988 deleted the requirement forNRC prior approval of procedures except those specified by section 3.1.13.The revised definition of ``Review Significant'' would limit review ofprocedures to those specified by Section 3.9.13. Section 6.5 defines the licensee's review and audit requirements for TMI-2.The licensee proposes to reduce the minimum staffing requirement for theTMI-2 Safety Review Group (SRG) after completion of defueling and eliminationof the possibility of a criticality. The SRG would be reduced from onemanager and five engineers to one manager and three engineers. The licenseefurther proposes that once all canisters containing fuel have been shippedoffsite the SRG would be eliminated. In its place the licensee proposesto implement a new requirement for Independent Safety Reviewers (ISRs).These ISRs would perform the independent review of the subjects listedin Specification 6.5.2.5. The licensee states that following the completionof defueling the reduction in the minimum SRG staffing requirement to amanager and three engineers can be implemented without significantly affectingthe ability of the SRG to perform its required functions. The licenseebelieves that the proposed reduction in the SRG minimum staffing requirementsis appropriate based on the reduced scope of the cleanup activities afterthe end of defueling. Once all fuel in canisters have been shipped offsite the reactor vesseland the reactor coolant system drained the potential for a release exceedingthe guidelines of 10 CFR 50 Appendix I will be essentially eliminated.The potential for any immediate notification as required by by 10 CFR 50.72or reportable by 10 CFR 50.73, both of which currently require SRG review,will be unlikely. Most plant systems and components will be isolated andnot operating. The licensee believes that the need for the SRG will nolonger exist. The ISRs will perform the function previously performed bythe SRG. Changes to procedures will continue to receive review and approvalby Responsible Technical Reviewers (RTRs). Section 6.9.1, Routine Reports and Reportable Occurrences, and 6.9.2, SpecialReports, require that specific reports be submitted to the NRC Region IAdministrator unless otherwise noted. The licensee proposes to change bothsections and specify that reports be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR50.4. Specific requirements for the submission of reports are containedin 10 CFR 50.4. The proposed change is administrative in nature and removesany conflict with existing regulatory requirements and the current technicalspecifications. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. TMI-2 is currently in a post-accident, cold shutdown, long-term cleanupmode. The licensee is presently completing the defueling of the damagedreactor, and readying the plant for long-term storage. As of the end ofJune 1989, greater than 90 percent of the fuel contained in the reactorvessel has been removed. Defueling activities will be completed in thefall of 1989. The staff has determined in previous license amendments,that the potential accidents analyzed for TMI-2 in the current cleanup-modeare bounded in scope and severity by the range of accidents originallyanalyzed in the facility FSAR. The changes proposed by the licensee arechanges to the Appendix A Technical Specifications. The proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated because no changes are proposed tocurrent safety systems or setpoints. The proposed changes do not createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated because no new modes of operation or new equipmentare being introduced. The proposed changes revise the review proceduresfor the facility and as such do not directly affect the potential or severityof an accident at TMI-2. The proposed changes in review procedures is commensuratewith the potential and severity of an accident at TMI-2 during these lastphases of the current cleanup effort. The proposed changes do not involvea significant reduction in the margin of safety, because, as mentionedpreviously, the changes are either administrative in nature or eliminateunnecessary personnel or review requirements.

Parameters such as shutdown margin, reactivity coefficients and power peakingfactors are not affected by the change. The specification of the fuel enrichmentin the Design Features section alone does not uniquely determine nor limitthe values of the reactor core parameters contained elsewhere in the TS.Each reload design is evaluated to confirm that the cycle core design adheresto the limits that exist in the current accident analyses and TS. Withrespect to increasing the maximum enrichment which can be stored in newfuel or spent fuel storage racks, criticality analyses have been performedby the licensee to demonstrate that applicable NRC licensing criteria aremet for the receipt and storage of 4.55 weight percent U-235 fuel. The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92.

Closing one blocking valve wouldenhance the control of flow using the bypass valve around the main flowcontrol valve (minimum flow control valve), and reduce the excessive serviceconditions that result when the main flow control valves are used to controlfeedwater flow during periods of low flow demand. In addition, the effectiveuse of the minimum flow control valves would reduce thermal cycling thatis currently experienced on the reactor feedwater nozzles and feedwaterpiping. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards (10 CFR 50.92(c)) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee provided the following analysis in its May 1, 1989 submittal:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedbecause the HPCI system is not considered an engineering safety featureand its operation is not considered in analyses demonstrating compliancewith 10 CFR 50 Appendix K requirements. Since the core spray system isthe design basis system for loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) makeup watercapability, operation with one HPCI train available during reactor startupwill have no adverse effect on any previously evaluated accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Asdiscussed above, modifying the reactor startup procedure to close the feedwaterpump blocking valve will improve feedwater flow control, reduce excessivemain flow control valve service conditions, and reduce thermal cyclingof feedwater nozzles and piping. This change represents a modificationto a normal plant evolution that improves operations and may contributeto maintaining the integrity of HPCI/feedwater system components. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety since HPCI flow is not credited in establishing safetymargins. The core spray system is the design basis system for makeup flowto the core during a LOCA. Although the HPCI system is not a safety-relatedsystem, one train of HPCI would be available to provide normal HPCI flowupon automatic LOCA initiation. Additionally the closed feedwater pumpblocking valve is a motor-operated valve capable of being fully open 60seconds after manual initiation. </ITAG>The staff agrees with the licensee's analysis.

The licensee's applicationis in response to this NRC initiative. The proposed amendment would revisethe Appendix A Technical Specifications of the facility operating limits,applicable to Cycle 13, with a reference to a Core Operating Limits Report,which would specify the values of those limits for future operating cycles.The cycle-specific limits include (a) limiting control rod pattern definition,(b) rod block monitor upscale trip settings, (c) maximum average planarlinear heat generation rate and (d) minimum critical power ratio. Theselimits will be determined in accordance with previously approved methodology.The methodology, described in the staff-approved vendor documents, wouldnot be affected by this amendment. The Core Operating Limits Report foreach reload, and any mid-cycle revisions, are to be provided to the NRCupon issuance by the licensee. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined thatit involves no significant hazards considerations. According to 10 CFR50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significanthazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance withthe proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed revision to the License Condition is in accordance with theguidance provided in Generic Letter 88-16 for licensees requesting relocationof cycle-specific parameter limits from the Technical Specifications toa reference Core Operating Limits Report. The establishment of these limitsin accordance with NRC-approved methodology, and the incorporation of theselimits into the Core Operating Limits Report in a manner consistent withGeneric Letter 88-16 guidance, will (1) ensure that proper steps are takento determine the values of these limits, (2) enable the staff to reviewthe values of these limits without the need for prior approval, and (3)eliminate the need for frequent Technical Specifications amendments whichare applicable to only a single fuel cycle. The revised Technical Specificationswith the deletion of the values of cycle-specific parameter limits andthe reference to the Core Operating Limits Report does not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.It also do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safetysince the changes does not alter the methods and criteria used to establishthese limits. Consequently, the proposed removal of the values of cycle-specificlimits does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. Because the values of cycle-specific core operating limits are simply beingrelocated to a reference document and will continue to be determined inaccordance with an NRC-approved methodology and in a manner consistentwith the applicable limits of the safety analysis, the proposed amendmentis administrative in nature and does not impact the operation of the facilityin a manner that involves significant hazards considerations. The proposed amendment does not alter the requirement that the plant beappropriately operated within the limits for cycle-specific parametersnor that specific remedial actions must be taken when these limits arenot met. With the removal of the values of these limits from the TechnicalSpecifications, and their incorporation into the Core Operating LimitsReport that is to be submitted to the Commission, appropriate means willexist for staff review of the values of these limits. Accordingly, theproposed amendment is administrative in nature and does not impact theoperation of the facility in a manner that involves significant hazardsconsiderations.

As discussed in Generic Letter 85-16, there have beenincidents at operating plants in which boric acid crystallization in safety-relatedsystem components has been sufficient to render the systems inoperable.The changes proposed in this license amendment request (LAR) would reducethe potential for such incidents at Diablo Canyon and reduce routine maintenanceand operations problems associated with the boric acid storage and transfersystem. The requirement to maintain heat tracing as a condition for operabilitywould be deleted because the precipitation temperature for 4 weight percentboric acid is much closer to room temperature than for the 12 weight percentboric acid currently in use. The heat tracing system as presently installedwith its associated redundancy and alarm capability will be maintainedand used as necessary to prevent precipitation. The specific TS changes proposed would include the following: (1) TS 3.1.1.1, ``Shutdown Margin - Tavg Greater than 200 degrees F.''Due to a decrease in boric acid concentration from 12 weight percent (20,000ppm) to 4 weight percent (7,000 ppm) the borated water flow rate will beincreased from 10 gallons per minute (gpm) to 30 gpm. (2) TS 3.1.1.2, ``Shutdown Margin - Tavg Less Than or Equal to 200 degreesF.'' As in Technical Specification 3.1.1.1, boron concentration will bedecreased from 20,000 ppm to 7,000 ppm and borated water flow rate increasedfrom 10 to 30 gpm. (3) TS 4.1.2.1, ``Flow Path - Shutdown.'' The surveillance requirementfor verification of the temperature of the heat tracing will be changedfrom 145 degrees F to 65 degrees F and the reference to heat traced portionsof the flow path will be deleted. (4) TS 4.1.2.2, ``Flow Path - Operating.'' The same revisions as in TS4.1.2.1 will be made. Also, TS 4.1.2.2d, which verifies every 18 monthsthat the flow path to the RCS delivers a flow rate of 10 gpm, will be changedto 30 gpm. (5) TS 3.1.2.5, ``Borated Water Source - Shutdown.'' Since the boron concentrationwill be decreased from 20,000 to 7,000 ppm, the minimum usable boratedwater volume will be increased from 835 to 2,499 gallons. Also, the minimumsolution temperature will be changed from 145 degrees F to 65 degrees F,the reference to a heat tracing channel will be deleted, the referenceto a minimum boron concentration of 2,000 ppm for Unit 1 Cycle 2 will bedeleted, and the cycle dependent notes will be deleted. (6) TS 3.1.2.6, ``Borated Water Source - Operating.'' Since the boron concentrationwill be decreased from 20,000 to 7,000 ppm, the minimum usable boratedwater volume will be increased from 5,106 to 14,042 gallons. Also, theminimum solution temperature will be changed from 145 degrees F to 65 degreesF, the reference to a heat tracing channel will be deleted, the referenceto a boron concentration between 2,000 and 2,200 ppm for Unit 1 Cycle 2will be deleted, and the cycle dependent notes will be deleted. (7) TS 3.5.5, ``Refueling Water Storage Tank.'' This specification willbe revised to reflect that a boron concentration of between 2,300 ppm and2,500 ppm is being utilized in Units 1 and 2 and the cycle dependent noteswill be deleted. (8) TS 3.9.1, ``Refueling Operations - Boron Concentration.'' The actionstatement will be revised to reflect the change to 7,000 ppm boric acidsolution and the increased boric acid flowrate to 30 gpm. (9) TS 3.10.1, ``Special Test Exceptions - Shutdown.'' The action statementwill be revised to reflect the change to 7,000 ppm boric acid solutionand the increased boric acid flow rate to 30 gpm. (10) TS Bases 3/4.1.2, ``Boration Systems.'' The second paragraph currentlystates that, ``The maximum expected boration capability requirement occursat EOL from full power equilibrium xenon conditions.'' This will be replacedby ``The maximum expected boration capability occurs at BOL when boratingfrom hot zero percent power to cold shutdown ....'' The minimum usableborated water volume of 5,106 gallons will be increased to 14,042 gallonsand the boron concentration of 20,000 ppm will be decreased to 7,000 ppm.Also, the reference in the Bases specifying the volume of borated waterin the refueling water storage tank (RWST) needed to provide adequate shutdownmargin will be changed from 75,000 gallons to 65,784 gallons. The abovechanges affect Modes 1 to 4. The requirements for borated water for Modes 5 and 6 are also affected.The boric acid tank (BAT) required volume will change from 835 gallonsof 20,000 ppm borated water to 2,499 gallons of 7,000 ppm borated water.The reference in the Bases specifying the water volume in the RWST neededto provide adequate shutdown margin will be increased from 9,690 to 17,865gallons. Also, the reference to having heat tracing as a requirement foroperability of the system is proposed to be deleted. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment will not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee, in its submittal of July 5, 1989, evaluated the proposedchanges against the significant hazards criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 and againstthe Commission guidance concerning application of this standard.

The RWST, however,supplies borated water to mitigate accidents such as, Minor Secondary SystemBreaks (FSAR Update Section 15.3.2), and, ``Rupture of a Main Steam Line(FSAR Section 15.4.2.1).'' The new RWST volumes specified in the Basessection of the Technical Specification for the BAT and RWST are boundedby the current volumes specified in the Technical Specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b.

Reducingthe boric acid concentration from 12 weight percent to 4 weight percentwill reduce the probability of precipitation of boric acid in the EmergencyCore Cooling flow path. Furthermore, the removal of heat tracing from thetechnical specifications will have no adverse effect because the fluidtemperature will still be required to be maintained above the solubilitylimit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c.

The acceptance criteria willensure that these penetrations can withstand the post accident containmentpressure with minimal leakage and that degradation of leakage integrityis detected in a timely manner. PCN 211 will also establish opening limitsfor the containment vent valves. Provisions to limit the valve openingsare currently in place in accordance with NRC requirements. These provisionswill minimize the force required to close the valves during a design basisLOCA thus providing additional assurance of the isolation function of thesevalves. The proposed change will establish requirements to ensure the valveopening limitations are maintained. PCN 211 will incorporate limiting conditionsfor operation (LCOs) and ACTION statements for the personnel air locksconsistent with the Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications intothe Technical Specifications. Finally, PCN 211 will reduce the lower testpressure for the personnel airlock from 10 psig to 3 psig. This changewill enhance the reliability of the airlock by limiting unnecessary stressesplaced on airlock components during testing at 10 psig.

Reduction of the lowertest pressure for the air lock from 10 psig to 3 psig does not affect themargin of safety since the direction of the test pressure is opposite thatwhich the door would experience during an accident.

The change wouldrevise the Reactor Coolant System pressure/temperature (PT) limit curves,low temperature overpressure protection (LTOP) temperatures, and associatedbases to be effective up to 8 effective full power years (EFPY) of operation.The maximum allowable Reactor Coolant System pressure at any temperatureis based upon the stress limitations for brittle fracture considerations.Technical Specification 3/4.4.8.1, ``Reactor Coolant System, Pressure/TemperatureLimits,'' provides operational constraints in all modes of reactor operationto ensure that the most stress limiting location in the reactor pressurevessel is not susceptible to brittle failure as a consequence of reactoroperations. The neutron-induced enbrittlement of the reactor vessel wallalso affects the temperature below which LTOP is required. LTOP is providedby the Shutdown Cooling System (SDCS) relief valves, which must be alignedbelow the specified temperature to provide assurance that the reactor vesselwill be operated in the ductile region in accordance with 10 CFR Part 50,Appendix G, during both normal operation and overpressurization eventsdue to equipment malfunction or operator error. Technical Specificationsrequire alignment of the SDCS relief valves at temperatures below the temperaturecorresponding to the PT curve pressurizer relief valve set point of 2500psia. The current Unit 3 RCS PT limit curves in the Technical Specification3/4.4.8, Figures 3.4-2 and 3.4-3, are valid for 4 EFPY and are based onthe adjusted RT<T2>NDT</T2> of 103anddegrees; F. The current LTOP temperature is 285anddegrees;F and provides RCS pressure relief at temperatures below the intersectionof the pressurizer relief valve setpoint, 2500 psia, and the 30anddegrees;F/hr heatup curve. The proposed change would revise the PT limits for heatup and cooldownshown in Figures 3.4-2 and 3.4-3, respectively, and the LTOP temperature,based on the fluence at 8 EFPY. The minimum boltup temperature would be86anddegrees; F as stated in the proposed Technical Specification 3.4.8.1.d.An analysis was conducted by the licensees in accordance with 10 CFR Part50, Appendix G; Standard Review Plan Sections 5.2.2 and 5.3.2; ASME Bandamp;PVCode, Section III, Division 1, Appendix G; and Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision2, May 1988. Using values listed in the FSAR Table 5.2-5, ``San Onofre3 Beltline Material,'' an adjusted RT<T2>NDT</T2> of 92.4anddegrees; F was calculated by the licensees based onthe projected fluence at 8 EFPY. Separate heatup and cooldown LTOP temperatures,302anddegrees; F and 267anddegrees; F, respectively, were calculated. The LTOPheatup and cooldown temperatures were determined from the intersectionsof the pressurizer relief valve setpoint and the 60anddegrees; F/hr heatupcurve and 100anddegrees; F/hr cooldown curve, respectively, at which theLTOP functions must be transferred between the SDCS relief valves and thepressurizer relief valve during heatup and cooldown. The effect on theheatup and cooldown curves due to the PT limits for the closure flangehas been analyzed and incorporated into these curves. The material correlationswere based on the copper and nickel content of the reactor vessel in accordancewith the new Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2. The proposed LTOP controlling pressure of 416 psia corresponds to the calculatedmaximum RCS pressure which could be reached during a postulated overpressurizationevent in the temperature region where the LTOP system is aligned. Moreover,the licensees state that LTOP controlling pressure is more limiting thanthe PT limit curves, providing added margin that the PT limit is not exceeded.The licensees believe that the intersections of the LTOP controlling pressurewith the 30anddegrees; F/hr heatup curve provides the temperature at whichthe heatup rate can be increased to 30anddegrees; F/hr. The temperaturesfor which even higher heatup rates are proposed has been determined ina similar manner. Using interpolation, the licensee has constructed a continuouscurve of allowed RCS heatup rate versus coolant temperature. The intersectionof the LTOP control pressure with the 100anddegrees; F/hr cooldown curveprovides the temperature at which the cooldown rate must be reduced. Asdescribed for the heatup curve, the licensee has constructed a curve ofthe maximum permitted cooldown rate versus RCS coldleg temperature. The proposed change would also modify Technical Specification Table 4.4-5,``Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program - Withdrawal Schedule.''This table provides the schedule by which the reactor vessel surveillancecapsules are to be withdrawn. The proposal would change the withdrawaltime for the first Unit 3 surveillance capsule from 5.6 EFPY to 4.4 EFPY.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided the followingno significant hazards consideration determination: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Will operation of the facility in accordance with this proposedchange involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof any accident previously evaluated? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Response: No. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To compensate for any increase in the RT<T2>NDT</T2> caused by irradiation, limits on the pressure-temperaturerelationship are periodically changed in accordance with 10 CFR 50, AppendixG, to stay within the stress limits during any condition of normal operation,including anticipated operational occurrences and system hydrostatic tests,which the pressure boundary may be subjected to over its service lifetime.The update to Figures 3.4-2 and 3.4-3, which includes new LTOP settings,incorporates the changes of the pressure-temperature relationship analyzedusing conservative fluence values. The update, therefore, maintains marginsof safety against the nonductile failure of the reactor pressure vessel.The change to Table 4.4-5 provides only a change in schedule for withdrawalof the first surveillance capsule for Unit 3.

Inaddition, the wording of Table 4.3-2, ``Functional Unit,'' Item 6.g, isrevised to correct an inadvertent omission from a previous license amendment.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>TVA provided the following information in its submittal to supportits proposed changes to the TS: <ITAG tagnum="21">By letter dated November 17, 1987, TVA submitted proposed TS change87-40.

TVA identified that the timedelays were added to the logic sequence to prevent spurious actuation becauseof signal noise. This minimizes the potential for the detrimental effectsof raw water injection into the steam generators. This design feature isbased on economic concerns. At the time, TVA concluded that the time delaysshould not be included in the TSs because the equipment did not meet thecriteria specified in the NRC policy statement on TS content as publishedin the February 6, 1987, edition of the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The inclusion of the logic time delays was discussedwith NRC during their review of TS 87-40. During these discussions, itwas concluded that, because the logic timers are an integral part of theactuation sequence for automatically transferring AFW suction, it was appropriatethat these be included in the TSs. TVA committed to add the logic timersto the TSs in a November 23, 1988, letter to NRC. NRC recognized this commitmentin their December 30, 1988, letter approving TS 87-40. Change 1 describedabove satisfied this commitment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The deletion of the current wording of Action 21 of Table 3.3-3 ismade to facilitate the generation of a new action appropriate for the AFWsuction transfer pressure switches and time delays.

In December 1986, the NRC conducted a ControlRoom Habitability Survey at NA-1andamp;2. The survey was documented in anNRC letter dated May 4, 1987 and in NRC Inspection Report 87-19, datedSeptember 10, 1987. The results of the survey identified various controlroom habitability issues that needed to be resolved. The response to thesurvey was documented in the licensee's letters dated June 8, 1987 andSeptember 11, 1987. One of the survey issues dealt with control room accessduring an emergency. The survey identified that the procedure for limitingaccess to the control room might not be workable. The licensee's responseto this issue indicated that an engineering evaluation would be performedto determine the best method for limiting access to the control room followingan accident. In September 1988, a followup NRC inspection was performedto resolve the issues opened in the Control Room Habitability Survey. Thisfollowup inspection was documented in Inspection Report 88-28, dated November23, 1988. During this inspection, the licensee committed to provide theresults of the engineering evaluation and any proposed corrective actionsby February 28, 1989. The licensee's submittal of March 1, 1989 documents the results of theengineering evaluation and describes the corrective actions taken to ensurecompliance with General Design Criterion (GDC) 19 of Appendix A to 10 CFRPart 50. During accident scenarios at NA-1andamp;2, the control room envelope is pressurized(upon receipt of a control room isolation signal) to 0.05 inch water gaugeto minimize in-leakage of air and airborne radioactive material. The pressurizationis initially provided by a bottled air system, which has sufficient capacityto supply the control room for 60 minutes. When the bottled air supplyis depleted, breathing and pressurization air are provided by an emergencyfiltered air system which draws air from the turbine building through HEPAand charcoal filters. The emergency ventilation system maintains the controlroom envelope at a minimum pressure of 0.04 inch water gauge relative tothe outside atmosphere. Previous radiological dose evaluations for thecontrol room during accident scenarios assumed zero in-leakage of unfilteredair while the control room envelope is pressurized. Inherent in this assumptionwas the condition that no doors to the control room are opened. However,the emergency operating procedures at NA-1andamp;2 require personnel to enterand exit the control room envelope during an accident. It was thereforenecessary for the licensee to modify the NA-1andamp;2 control room habitabilitycalculations to address the impact to the required door openings on thecontrol room doses. The Condition IV accidents defined in Chapter 15 ofthe NA-1andamp;2 UFSAR are those which result in the most significant impacton control room habitability. Specifically, the following accident conditionswere addressed in the licensee's evaluation: (1) Loss of Coolant Accident(LOCA), (2) Main Steam Line Breaks (MSLB), (3) Fuel Handling Accident (FHA),(4) Steam Generator Tube Rupture (SGTR), and (5) Locked Rotor Accident(LRA). Calculations were performed to determine the 30-day dose to control roominhabitants, and the calculations were based on models and methodologywhich are consistent with NUREG-0800 which assumes unfiltered in-leakageat 10 cubic feet per minute (cfm) for the duration of the accident to accountfor control room access. The evaluation determined that the MSLB and the SGTR are the two most limitingaccidents for radiation exposure to the control room operator. The resultsof the licensee's evaluation indicate that the radiation exposure to controlroom operators is increased above the assumptions currently delineatedin Chapter 15 of the NA-1andamp;2 UFSAR. However, all of the accident scenariosthat can have a significant impact on control room operator doses weredetermined to be within the limits specified by GDC-19. Acceptable meansof allowing required entries to control room pressure envelope during thefirst hour of an accident were also identified. This involved several modificationsof the NA-1andamp;2 control room habitability system to ensure that dosesto control room personnel do not exceed the limits of GDC-19. These modificationsincluded: (1) operation of two fan/filter units of the emergency ventilationsystem in the recirculation mode for the duration of the accident, (2)initiation of the emergency ventilation recirculation concurrent with actuationof the bottled air system (i.e., on safety injection), and (3) initiationof control room isolation on receipt of a fuel building high-high radiationalarm. The licensee's dose calculations assumed that these modificationswere made. For those cases where the system modifications have not yetbeen implemented, it was verified that intermediate measures, such as temporaryprocedures, are in place to ensure that GDC-19 requirements will be satisfied.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)).

The licenseeprovided the following discussion regarding the above three criteria: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The change does not involve a significant change in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. There are no systemchanges which increase the probability of an accident occurring.

A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed Technical Specification changeand has determined that the changes would involve no significant hazardsconsideration. The licensee's basis for this conclusion is that the proposedamendment would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. The proposed change does not involveany alterations to the way the emergency diesel generators are operatedor constructed. Rather, the new TS defines an adequate fuel oil volumecapacity that is essential for sustaining continuous operation of one dieselgenerator for 7 days as assumed in the USAR and required by NRC acceptedguides and standards. Therefore, this change does not involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously analyzed. The proposed amendment would not involvea significant change in the assumptions specified in the USAR, thereforeit would not place the plant in an unanalyzed condition. The 8-hour supplyprovided by the day tank would be changed to indicate a specific volumerequirement of 1000 gallons. The proposed minimum volume specificationis well within the guidelines specified in Regulatory Guide 1.137 and ANSIstandard N-195-1976. Therefore, the proposed amendment will not createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously analyzed. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposedchange will decrease the fuel oil in each diesel generator's respectiveday tanks and increase the amount of fuel oil in the two underground storagetanks. The total onsite storage of fuel will increase. Although the proposedday tank specification is reduced, there is still a wide margin of conservatismwith respect to ANSI N195-1976/ANS-59.51. Thus, there is no significantreduction in the margin of safety. The staff has reviewed the licensee's determination that the proposed licenseamendment involves no significant hazards consideration and agrees withthe licensee's analysis. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determinethat the proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of Wisconsin LibraryLearning Center, 2420 Nicolet Drive, Green Bay, Wisconsin 54301. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>David Baker, Esq.

The changesare to relax the test frequency for the containment purge supply and exhaustisolation valves. Surveillance Requirement (SR) 4.6.3.4 which is deletedstated that each containment purge isolation valve be demonstrated operablewithin 24 hours after each closing of the valve except when the valve isbeing used for multiple cyclings. Any purge valve that has undergone multiplecyclings is required to be tested at least every 72 hours. Operabilityis demonstrated by performance of a Type C leak test of Appendix J to 10CFR Part 50. This test is to verify that the measured leakage rate fromeach purge valve, when added to the leakage rates for all other Type Band Type C penetrations, does not exceed 60 percent of the maximum containmentleakage rate (La). In lieu of SR 4.6.3.4, a new surveillance requirement is added under ContainmentVentilation System Specification 3.6.1.9. The new SR 4.6.1.9.3 relaxs the24/72-hour test requirement to include a 3-month test interval and establishesa specific maximum leakage rate of 0.05 La for each purge valve. An actionstatement from Revision 5 of the NRC Standard Technical Specifications(STS) is added to address operability requirements for leakage in excessof 0.05 La to be consistent with the revised surveillance requirement.These changes are patterned after Revision 5 of the NRC STS. <T3>Date of issuance: </T3>July 5, 1989 <T3>Effective date: </T3>July 5, 1989 <T3>Amendment Nos.: </T3>120, 109 <T3>Facility Operating Licenses Nos.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particularfacility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By September 8, 1989, the licensee mayfile a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendmentto the subject facility operating license and any person whose interestmay be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a partyin the proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene.Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filedin accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic LicensingProceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petitionfor leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or anAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by theChairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on therequest and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or theAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or request shouldbe granted based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v)and 2.714(d). <ITAG tagnum="84">Duquesne Light Company, Docket No. 50-334 Beaver Valley Power Station,Unit No. 1, Shippingport, Pennsylvania </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendment: </T3>June 22, 1989 <T3>Brief description of amendment: </T3>The amendment raises the maximumallowed service water (river water) temperature from 86anddegrees; F to 90anddegrees;F.
