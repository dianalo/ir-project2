Separate sections of the Fermi surface (FS) of the alloyare plotted by positions of explicit Kohn anomalies in the vicinity ofthe X point of Brillouin zone. Change of FS sizes is stated to be incorrespondence with variation of conductivity electron concentrationat formation of a disordered solid solution of gallium atoms in copperlattice. Conditions for arising anomalies of Kohn and Taylor types incopper and in Cu-Ga alloy are analyzed on the basis of the conductedcalculations of copper electron band structure, and the effect of spectrumelectron composition on the character of arising anomalies is considered.It is noted that approximation of ''rigid zones'' used in analysis ofthe electron band structure of Cu-Ga alloy satisfactorily describes changeof the FS section of the alloy in the direction (110) of the reverselattice with increase in conductivity electron density. 22 refs.; 7 figs.;1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
