Life-of-contract highs in grains paced one of the largest single-day increases ever in commodity prices, as measured by the Commodity Research Bureau's futures-price index. The index, which tracks 26 raw-material prices, rose 6.17 to 235.41, a two-year high.    Traders cited predictions of hot, dry weather in the Farm Belt.    &quot;Some of these guys are betting this is the big drought of 1987,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center for Georgia State University.    A heat wave that has struck the West and high temperatures in parts of the Midwest have underscored forecasts that there will be a mild drought this summer. And light showers expected this week won't be enough to &quot;alleviate&quot; fears, says David Taylor, chief climatologist for Weather Sevices Corp. in Bedford, Mass.    Yesterday's rally occurred in the face of bulging U.S. agricultural surpluses, including a 10-month supply of wheat and a nine-month supply of corn.    Soybean futures saw the sharpest rise. The recent runup in soybeans for May delivery has been high enough for the Commodity Credit Corp. to sell some of its inventory.    In the morning 8.5 million bushels were sold, according to an Agriculture Department spokesman. The sale should put a lid on May contract prices, said Mickey Luth, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago.    Because crops are in a very early stage of development, it may be too early to worry very much about the weather, analysts say.    Generally, said Georgia State's Mr. Ratajczak, crop conditions are &quot;at the point where all we need is a decent rain, and all will work out.&quot;    Still, traders were swept up by the inflationary mood. &quot;Everybody loves a bull market,&quot; said Ted Mao, an analyst with Shearson in New York.    In other futures markets yesterday:    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork belly and hog prices surged their daily limits. Too few hogs are available to meet the demand of packers for slaughter, said Gerald Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. Meanwhile, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange still hadn't taken any action to limit traders' holdings of pork bellies for May delivery. Traders speculated last week that the Chicago Merc would take action to prevent price distortions amid tight supplies. Cattle futures rose, led by contracts for delivery in the next couple of months. Prices of cattle for later delivery rose less, and analysts cited a government report, set for release Friday, on cattle inventories in seven major beef-producing states. The report is expected to show that cattle raisers put 7% to 8% more young animals on feedlots last month compared with a year earlier. The total number of animals on feedlots as of May 1 is expected to be up 1%, and the report is expected to show that about the same number of cattle were sold for slaughter in April as a year earlier.    COPPER: Prices rose again amid tight near-term supplies. Traders are watching price differences between nearer and later months closely, analysts said. For example, the May contract's premium over December's contract is 1.55 cents, while July's is 0.7 cent. &quot;If those spreads tighten, traders might take it as an indication that the market is topping out,&quot; an analyst said. The current advance, based on tight supplies, may be overdone, he said. &quot;Technical buying is carrying the ball a little more now, as is buying influenced by inflation fears,&quot; he said. And copper &quot;tends to rise on economic uncertainty but lags precious metals,&quot; an analyst said.    PRECIOUS METALS: Prices, led by strong gains in silver, rose in moderate trading. &quot;The consensus is that with commodity prices moving up, inflation sentiment is moving in,&quot; said Nancy Nohavec, senior gold trader at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. Many traders hold precious metals as a hedge against inflation. June gold prices on the Comex rose $1 an ounce to $457.70. Analysts said the gains in gold were limited partly by response to an unconfirmed report in the Japanese press late last week that the Japanese plan to sell 100 tons of the metal. &quot;That put a damper on the gold market,&quot; a Comex trader said. In addition, some traders have shied away from precious metals after getting stung two weeks ago when gold and silver prices plunged in one of the most volatile trading sessions in recent years. Still, many analysts remain bullish about the coming months. &quot;The feeling is that other commodities are now catching up to the recent increases in gold and silver,&quot; said Shearson's Ms. Nohavec. &quot;It's the other commodities' turn.&quot;    ENERGY: Oil futures rose to almost their life-of-contract highs in quiet, nervous trading. Many gains were spurred by technical trading as prices passed $19.25 a barrel, some traders said. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for June delivery rose 15 cents to $19.41 a barrel. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts also rose. Some analysts said prices also were bolstered by speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will raise prices at its meeting in late June. In the meantime, &quot;OPEC has done a good job of convincing the markets that it's serious&quot; about its current production and pricing pact, Peter Cardillo, futures trading adviser for Josephthal andamp; Co., New York, said.    COFFEE: A report of cold weather in Brazil touched off buying of futures even though the cold spell occurred about 700 miles from coffee-growing areas and wasn't a threat, analysts said. The July contract on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange settled at $1.2276 a pound, almost the high for the day and a gain of 6.36 cents. Brazil's coffee-producing regions are most vulnerable to frost during July and August, so the current scare is much too early, one analyst said. &quot;There has only been one frost this century as early as May,&quot; she said. Moreover, she said, coffee trees won't begin to flower until mid-June, so a frost now wouldn't affect production unless it was severe enough to damage the trees themselves, which isn't likely.    STOCK INDEXES: Prices shot higher early on, lifted by a wave of individual buying that triggered arbitrage-related futures selling and stock buying, traders said. The massive stock purchases drove futures back still higher, they said. In the end, though, fears that surging commodity prices herald higher inflation sent stock index futures, as well as bond futures, sharply lower. There's worry &quot;the Federal Reserve Board may have to tighten&quot; its grip on credit to try to stem inflation, a move that could damp economic growth, said J.R. Fredericks, an analyst with E. David Stephens Corp. in Chicago. </TEXT></DOC>
