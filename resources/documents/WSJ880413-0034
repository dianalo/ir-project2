The suit claims that William Moreland, operator of the program, and Richard Reynolds, the adviser who acted as exclusive seller of the investment contracts in the program, defrauded investors with a gold mining venture that was to have taken advantage of the disparity between the world market price for gold and the offering price of &quot;$250 per ounce.&quot;    The suit further claims that Mr. Moreland overstated the amount of gold reserves on his properties. The program raised about $1.7 million from about 250 investors in several states.    The suit alleges that Messrs. Moreland and Reynolds failed to register the gold-ore program as a securities offering, and that Mr. Reynolds failed to register as an adviser with the SEC.    The SEC's intervention is significant, given earlier attempts to bring legal action against the Moreland venture. As reported, the California Department of Corporations had moved to close down the gold-ore program. But a California appeals court, citing a 1985 federal court decision that a similar investment program didn't meet the definition of a security, ruled last August that Mr. Moreland's offering wasn't a security. The court overturned a cease-and-desist order by the department, and the California Supreme Court refused to review the decision.    The SEC suit seeks a permanent injunction to prevent the defendants from continuing their investment program, and to return all investor funds.    Mr. Moreland couldn't be reached for comment, but attorneys representing him have previously denied he committed any acts of fraud. An attorney for Mr. Reynolds in San Diego said &quot;we feel our client did nothing in violation of the securities laws.&quot; Joseph A. Johnson, a geologist allegedly hired by Mr. Moreland who is also named as a defendant in the suit, said he hadn't yet been served. </TEXT></DOC>
