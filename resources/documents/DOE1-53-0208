We determined that the crystalline anisotropy of the order parameter{Delta} was proportional to electron mean free path squared, as expectedtheoretically. Extrapolation to infinite mean free path gave a valuefor the mean-square anisotropy in {Delta} in pure Sn of andless;a{sup 2}andgt;{sub0} = 0.0053 +- 13%. The consistency of these results from sample to sample,and the agreement between all of these results and published theoreticaland experimental work, verifies the theory and demonstrates the feasibilityof using such measurements to study electron scattering in novel superconductingmaterials.</TEXT></DOC>
