(LotusDevelopment Corp.) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Martin, James.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>The success of Lotus has been largely the product of thephenomenal sales of the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet.andP;  There are 5million 1-2-3 users, but Lotus has had to work around changes inthe market and product delays in its planning for productupgrades.andP;  Lotus wants to extend as well as protect its installedbase, and to offer compatible spreadsheets and other applicationson all major platforms.andP;  Recent changes in the market includingthe popularity of the Intel 80286 and 80386 microprocessors, theincrease in connectivity and the growing market share of theMacintosh will have to be addressed by Lotus.andP;  These changes haveoccurred since the announcement of Lotus 1-2-3 3.0 in 1987, whichwas released in 1989.andP;  The product was delayed by problems withthe amount of memory needed by the feature-packed program and theneed to rewrite the core code modules in the platform-independentC language.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Lotus Development Corp.

 1-2-3 was well-designed andhas proven to be highly durable.andM;Today, with significant changes occurring in the industry, 1-2-3 is at acrossroad.andP;  Two long-overdue upgrades have finally been shipped, and to alarge extent the reaction of the installed base to these new products willdefine the future for Lotus.andM;The momentum of 5 million users and millions of 1-2-3 applications dictatethat change will take place slowly; but even slow movements of this largebase produce big numbers in sales.andP;  For example, upgrading to release 3.0 orrelease 2.2 by 20 percent of the installed base would represent almost 1million sales.andM;The strategy devised by Lotus for its spreadsheet products takes advantage ofits installed base and positions the company to respond to both technologicaland market dynamics.andM;Lotus' strategy with respect to spreadsheets appears to be concentrated inthe following areas:andM;-- Protecting and extending the market base.andM;-- Responding to the needs of character-based users with larger and morecomplicated spreadsheets, faster execution and better output.andM;-- Solving the &quot;islands of computing&quot; problem by offering highly compatiblespreadsheet products on most major platforms under all popular operatingsystems, including mainframes and minicomputers.andM;-- Offering several levels of data sharing, ranging from simple filecompatibility to dynamic exchange of data.andM;-- Providing seamless data sharing and application interaction under OS/2 forboth Lotus and other software products.andM;-- Integrating other Lotus products such as GraphWriter II and Manuscript tomake them more valuable when working with 1-2-3.andM;-- Continuing to extend spreadsheet products with add-ins developed using anew programming facility called Lotus Add-In Toolkit for release 3.0.andM;This strategy won't be easy to implement and is unlikely to be totallysuccessful, but there are indications that during this highly dynamic periodof change, Lotus has positioned itself to successfully meet the challengesand opportunities of the 1990s.andM;The introduction of the Intel 286 microprocessor created the opportunity tobuild microcomputers that had the potential of handling very largespreadsheets.andP;  Unfortunately, an enhanced operating system for thisprocessor, OS/2, was not yet available, making it impossible to take fulladvantage of the microprocessor's power.andP;  Under OS/2, as much as 16M bytes ofmemory can be accessed.andP;  Until OS/2 is commonly in use, the majority of userswill expect software products to operate in the limited DOS environment.andM;For the vendor, this discontinuity in hardware/software capabilities createsa difficult marketing problem.andP;  Does the vendor develop highly functionalsoftware products (requiring the capabilities of OS/2) and sell them to asmall but growing market?andP;  Or does the vendor constrain the functionality ofthe product so that it will operate in the popular DOS environment?andM;Lotus did not anticipate facing this dilemma during the development ofrelease 3.0, but it was quickly discovered.andM;Lotus first announced release 3.0 on April 27, 1987.andP;  The personal computermarket has always been unpredictable, and long-range projections have rarelybeen very accurate.andM;Changes that have occurred since 1-2-3 release 3.0 was announced include thefollowing:andM;-- The large base of 8088 and 8086 machines is expected to be eclipsed by 286and 386 machines in 1989.andM;-- Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh has achieved a market share of about 15percent.andM;-- Approximately 25 percent of PCs are currently networked.andP;  Expectations arethat within two years approximately 50 percent of PCs will be networked.andM;-- OS/2 is at least one year behind initial projections for marketpenetration.andM;-- The Unix operating system is continuing to gain acceptance as anenvironment for business computing.andM;Lotus resolved the problem of discontinuity between hardware and software byincorporating a DOS extender from Rational Software in release 3.0.andP;  DOSextenders (otherwise known as protected-mode technology) can provide accessto 16M bytes of memory while still operating under the DOS environment.andM;The figure outlines the major shifts in hardware and operating systems,driven to a large extent by the need to work with spreadsheets.andM;As these shifts occurred, investments in spreadsheet products, applicationsand training grew so large that solutions unable to protect these investmentswere unpalatable.andP;  In short, 1-2-3 had woven itself so successfully and sothoroughly into corporate computing cultures that few people wanted tochange.andM;There are two elements of Lotus' strategy that have affected the delivery ofits new spreadsheet products.andP;  As software has become more feature-laden,limitations on memory size have forced as much as 40 percent of thedevelopment process to be consumed with optimization of code.andM;Along with code, a reasonably sized spreadsheet must fit within 640K bytes inthe DOS environment.andP;  This is a technical problem shared by all softwaredevelopers and is one of the primary reasons that applications developersseek alternative operating systems.andM;Exacerbating this problem is an element of Lotus' strategy that places 1-2-3on multiple platforms.andP;  Maintenance and enhancements on a software productthis size, running on multiple platforms, are almost impossible if the corecode modules are not in a platform-independent common language.andM;To implement the multiplatform strategy, it was necessary to develop the newproduct in the C language.andP;  The resulting increase in code size (vs.andP;  themore compact Assembler implementation) along with the addition of newfeatures caused release 3.0 to exceed the targeted memory limits and miss theannounced delivery dates.andM;During the lengthy development process of release 3.0, the microcomputerindustry was not static.andP;  Despite the fact that the operating system for the286 chip is lagging far behind the hardware, corporate purchasers have movedquickly to the 286 with 1M byte of memory as a standard for all newpurchases.andM;Fewer than 20 percent of new sales are of the older 8088 and 8086 machines.andO;It is estimated that by 1991, 286 or 386 machines will represent close to 75percent of the total installed base of personal computers.andM;Challenges to 1-2-3andM;Even with the product delays, competitive threats, changing hardwareenvironments and delayed operating system availability, 1-2-3 continues to bethe best-selling spreadsheet in the world.andP;  There are currently moreindividuals who use 1-2-3 that any other software product.andM;Lotus will continue to face tough marketing challenges and strong competitivethreats, but the company is now better equipped to exploit more advancedcomputing platforms, use improved operating systems and serve the futureneeds of its huge customer base.andM;In the final article in this series next week, I'll discuss personalinformation managers, a new software category pioneered by the Lotus Agendaproduct, that are used to manipulate text and ideas.andM;----------To learn more about the subject of these articles, please call The JamesMartin Report, an information service updated quarterly, at (800) 242-1240.andO;For information on seminars, please contact (in the United States and Canada)Technology Transfer Institute, 741 10th St., Santa Monica, Calif.andP;
