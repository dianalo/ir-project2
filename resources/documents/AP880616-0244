Rejects Union Contract Proposal</HEAD><DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Weyerhaeuser Co. has rejected a unioncontract proposal in the midst of a strike against three otherNorthwest timber companies, according to a union official.   A Weyerhaeuser counterproposal was inadequate, Bill Hubbell,president of the International Woodworkers of America, saidWednesday.   Hubbell said no further talks were scheduled with the Tacoma,Wash.-based company, but negotiating subcommittees will meet in thenext few days to discuss proposed changes in Weyerhaeuser'sprofit-sharing plan.   Weyerhaeuser has about 7,500 union employees.   About 4,500 union workers have been on strike since June 6against Willamette Industries Inc., Champion International Corp.and DAW Forest Products Co. in Oregon, Washington and Montana.   The woodworkers' union and the Western Council of IndustrialWorkers called the strike after the companies rejected a contractaccepted earlier by Eugene-based Bohemia Inc.   The Bohemia contract reportedly provides a 5 percent raise inthe first year and 4 percent in each of the following three yearsof the contract.   The Weyerhaeuser counterproposal calls for a 4 percent increasein base pay over four years, Hubbell said. The company also offeredimprovements in its profit-sharing plan.   ``We're absolutely miles apart on base rates as it relates tothe Bohemia settlement,'' Hubbell said.   Company spokesman Lee Bjorklund declined to comment on detailsof Wednesday's negotiations, but described them as constructive.``Both parties acknowledged the need for considerable discussion ofdetailed issues,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
