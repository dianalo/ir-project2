House and Senate bargainers planned to resume their efforts onThursday to find a compromise to a measure proposed by Sen. JesseHelms, R-N.C., and passed by the Senate, barring federal subsidiesfor ``obscene or indecent material,'' or works that offend membersof any race, religion or sex.   Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., an opponent of the Helms provision,said he was considering offering guidelines, similar to SupremeCourt rulings, permitting federal aid to art that attained certainartistic, scholarly or other standards.   Yates, long a supporter of federal backing of the arts, has saidthe so-called Helms amendment is little short of governmentcensorship.   ``We don't want to hamstring the National Endowment for theArts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and every museum inthe country,'' he said.   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, a conservative who said he supportsthe thrust of Helms' language, said he believed a study of theendowment's grant-making procedures was needed. He also saidlegislation was needed stating ``what current congressionalattitudes are'' about offensive art.   ``Somebody made a mistake,'' McClure said during thenegotiations. ``Somebody should have stopped those materials frombeing a taxpayer-financed show.''   Helms, who is not a negotiator on the fate of his own amendment,told a reporter that he believed the bargainers would gut hisproposal, and indicated he might force the full Senate to vote onwhether to drop any compromise that emerges in favor of hisoriginal provision.   ``I'm not going to back up one inch,'' he said. ``They may haveto vote on it three or four times before we're through.''   Two grants made by the National Endowment for the Arts in thepast year prompted Helms' provision.   One of the controversial grants supported an exhibit thatincluded a photograph by Andres Serrano of a Christ figuresubmerged in a jar of urine. The other included Robert Mapplethorpephotographs depicting homosexual acts and the genitalia of children.   Helms' provision is part of the $10.9 billion Senate version ofa bill making appropriations for Interior Department and certainother programs, including arts programs.   The $11.5 billion House version includes a symbolic $45,000 cut,sponsored by Yates, in the $171 million appropriation for theNational Endowment for the Arts. The two grants at issue came to$45,000.   Yates is chairman of the House Appropriations interiorsubcommittee and leads the House members of the conferencecommittee handling the question.   The Senate adopted the Helms amendment with almost no debate ona July 26 voice vote.   Helms and other conservatives have argued that the governmenthas no business backing works of art that are ffensive to mostpeople.   Some arts groups, civil libertarians and others have said themeasure represents unconstitutional censorship, although many haveconceded that the endowment's use of the money seemed ofquestionable taste.   The Helms amendment prohibits federal aid for ``obscene orindecent materials,'' including ``depictions of sadomasochism,homo-eroticism, the exploitation of children or individuals engagedin sex acts.''   It forbids tax money to be spent on art that ``denigrates''people based on their religion, race, sex, handicap, age or ethnicorigin.   It also bans for five years any federal assistance to theSoutheastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C.,which showed the Serrano work, and the Institute of ContemporaryArt at the University of Pennsylvania, which hosted theMapplethorpe exhibit.   On Sept. 13, the House rejected 264-153 an attempt byconservatives to accept the Helms amendment.</TEXT></DOC>
