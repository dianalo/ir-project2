The 100% tariffs, levied Friday by the Reagan administration on selected Japanese-made personal computers, color televisions and power tools, send a forceful message of U.S. resolve to enforce its trade agreements with Japan, but the sanctions should inflict little actual damage on Japan's electronics giants or U.S. consumers, the executives said.    &quot;The thing is symbolic: a warning shot across the bow of the Japanese telling them what we can do. The dollar-amount of products involved is relatively small,&quot; said John Hatch, a spokesman for the American Electronics Association, a Santa Clara, Calif.-based trade group.    Specifically, the tariffs, which total less than 1% of last year's $112.3 billion two-way trade between Japan and the U.S., may dry up supplies of certain Japanese laptop personal computers, but their effect on sales and prices of TVs, power tools and desktop personal computers is expected to be minimal. That is because many retailers stocked up on these products in preparation for possible sanctions, and also because the U.S. government purposefully selected goods for tariffs that are competitively supplied by non-Japanese producers.    Moreover, many U.S. executives doubt the tariffs will even remain in place very long. In recent weeks, Japanese semiconductor producers have responded to their government's last-ditch directives to head off sanctions by cutting microchip production and stepping up compliance with the Semiconductor Trade Agreement. If such compliance continues for an unspecified period, President Reagan said he would withdraw the sanctions.    &quot;There has been an upward trend which would indicate that Japan is attempting to comply with the agreement,&quot; said Larry Grant, general counsel of Boise, Idaho-based Micron Technology Inc., a persistent critic of Japanese chip-pact violations. &quot;We should know in 30 to 60 days whether the Japanese plan to continue compliance or whether this is just a blip to avoid sanctions.&quot;    Hardest hit by the tariffs are Japanese producers of laptop and desktop personal computers, who will bear $180 million, or 60%, of the sanctions. Japanese exporters of 18-inch, 19-inch and 20-inch color TVs will pay $90 million of tariffs, while the sanctions will cost Japanese producers of certain power tools $30 million in tariffs.    The U.S. government is known to have singled out Japanese personal computer makers for the harshest retaliation because many of these concerns, including Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Toshiba Corp. and NEC Corp., are also major suppliers of chips and, hence, alleged violators of the chip pact. Toshiba and NEC are strong contenders in the U.S. market for the more powerful laptops, so if the tariffs discourage these concerns from exporting laptops to the U.S., supplies of these models in this country could fall and prices could rise. However, the tariffs won't affect a U.S. desktop market already overcrowded with competitors based in the U.S., Europe, Taiwan and South Korea.    As for TVs, the Japanese leaders in the U.S. market -- Sony Corp., Mitsubishi and Hitachi Ltd. -- already have plants in this country; the goods produced in these facilities aren't affected by the import tariffs. Moreover, many TV retailers said their warehouses are well stocked. &quot;We have very ample inventory,&quot; said Warren Hyman, chairman of Newmark andamp; Lewis Inc., a Hicksville, N.Y., TV and appliance retailer.    Similarly, the U.S. market for power tools shouldn't be disturbed by the sanctions. Japanese producers hold a small percentage of the market compared with the market leaders, U.S.-based Black andamp; Decker Corp. and Skil Corp. &quot;The duties are really going to help the American (power-tool) market,&quot; said Bert Wolvers, a salesman for Tooltown, a Paramus, N.J., store that caters to contractors. Added to the rising value of the Japanese yen, the duties will put &quot;such a high price on the Japanese stuff that nobody will buy it.&quot;    While the sanctions should have little effect on most Japanese electronics giants or U.S. consumers, analysts noted that victims of the tariffs include a number of &quot;innocent bystanders.&quot; For example, at least five Japanese companies make personal computers, and thus now have to pay the 100% tariffs, yet these companies don't produce chips. Epson Corp., for example, which doesn't manufacture semiconductors, is the leading Japanese exporter of personal computers to the U.S. with roughly 5% of the U.S. market.    Several U.S. companies that sell Japanese-made personal computers in the U.S. under their own labels also may be victimized by the tariffs. Wang Laboratories Inc. sells laptop computers in this country manufactured by Brother of Japan; Sperry Corp., which merged last year with Burroughs Corp. to form Unisys Corp., sells personal computers made by Mitsubishi; Zenith Electronics Corp. sells laptops made by Sanyo Electric Co., and Grid sells laptops made by Toshiba.    David Carnevale, a computer analyst with Infocorp, a Cupertino, Calif.-based market research concern, said one upshot of the sanctions will probably be to encourage more Japanese computer makers to set up factories in the U.S. This trend could anger Japanese workers who, like many workers in the U.S., have grown bitter in recent years over increasing offshore production. &quot;These are all world-class manufacturers we're talking about, and it's probably in their own best long-term interests to have plants in the U.S., Europe and the Pacific Basin anyway,&quot; said Mr. Carnevale.    ---                 Targets of U.S. Sanctions                                              AMOUNT                                             EXPORTED                                              TO U.S. PRODUCT                                  (in millions) Computers Portable and desktop microcomputers             $180 which have full 16 bit microprocessors, including laptops and transportables.
