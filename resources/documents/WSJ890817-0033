Thanks to declining interest rates and President Bush's savings-and-loan rescue plan, thrift stock prices are up an average of 44% since the beginning of the year.    Enthusiasm over the just-signed bailout bill -- especially a provision allowing commercial banks to acquire healthy thrifts immediately -- spurred additional gains of 20% or more for some thrifts in the first few days after the legislation was passed. And despite this jazzy showing, many thrift specialists say the long run is likely to be a winning one, at least for healthy institutions.    But for individuals tempted to invest in thrifts now, the pros urge caution. &quot;At these prices, with so many people jumping on the bandwagon, it pays to be selective,&quot; says Joseph Jolson, general partner and senior Sandamp;L analyst at Montgomery Securities.    Buying thrifts for their takeover potential is particularly risky at this juncture, thrift specialists say. That's because the market doesn't seem to have taken into account the numerous hurdles and regulatory unknowns that will stymie many thrift buy-outs. &quot;We won't see the feeding frenzy some people expect,&quot; says James Benson, a thrift analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    As the takeover euphoria runs its course, &quot;thrifts that have run up 15% to 20% or more in price since the bailout bill was passed will give up half those gains,&quot; says James K. Schmidt, a managing director of Freedom Capital Management Corp.    Although the takeover angle remains appealing in the long haul, most specialists advise investors to keep their eyes fixed on fundamental value when selecting thrift stocks -- and to view takeovers, when they occur, as gravy. &quot;Buy stocks you'd be comfortable with anyway, because you can wait a long time before {Citicorp Chairman} John Reed walks through the door,&quot; says Henry Peltz, a thrift analyst with Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc.    The best long-term bets, the pros say, are prosperous, well-heeled thrifts. These stand to benefit from better profit margins as the rescue program eliminates the competition from failing thrifts. Previously, says Gareth Plank, a thrift analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., healthy thrifts have had to pay as much as 1.3 percentage points above commercial-bank rates to compete for deposits with the Sandamp;L industry's &quot;brain-dead walking zombies.&quot;    The impact on profits, which analysts say has yet to be really captured in stock prices, could be considerable. Even a modest reduction in the deposit differential to around eight-tenths of a percentage point from an average of about one percentage point would &quot;probably result in 15% to 20% higher earnings for the industry,&quot; according to Laurence Fink, a thrift finance specialist at Blackstone Group. This positive profit trend would also help offset the risk of recession.    What's more, as the bailout bill forces a &quot;dramatic shrinkage in the thrift industry in the next five years,&quot; well-heeled institutions can take advantage of a buyers' market in thrift assets to increase their market share, says Peter Treadway, a thrift analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. Despite the current focus on takeovers by banking companies, &quot;I think the thrifts themselves will be better at picking among the wreckage,&quot; he says. &quot;They'll have their choice of branches, assets and franchises to buy.&quot;    To spot the winners, the pros say investors should look for the following:    Strong Balance Sheets. &quot;Stay away from thrifts that are wallowing in good will and bad assets,&quot; says Keefe Bruyette's Mr. Peltz. Thrifts will need tangible capital -- an excess of real assets over liabilities -- of at least 4% to 5% of assets to profit from market opportunities, analysts say.    Asset Quality. Thrifts should show a low percentage of nonperforming loans and a high proportion of single-family owner-occupied mortgage loans, which are considered the safest kind of asset. &quot;As a general rule, steer clear of savings-and-loans with too diversified a balance sheet,&quot; says Shearson's Mr. Plank. &quot;The simpler the business, the better off you are.&quot;    Earnings and Earnings Quality. Look for profit generated from interest on loans -- the most predictable form of revenue -- not from transactions. Mr. Plank suggests looking for thrifts with net interest income, after loan-loss provisions, that at least covers operating expenses.    Strong Franchises. A good market is important, as that helps buoy asset quality and allows room for growth in new loans. The most favored markets include California, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana and Florida. Areas to avoid include Arizona, Oklahoma, Colorado and Texas. &quot;You also want to see diversification,&quot; says Mr. Plank. H.F. Ahmanson, for instance, is a blue-chip California thrift with lending operations in 17 states.    Management Quality. Management should show a willingness to work for the shareholder. &quot;There's a substantial risk of getting trapped by a thrift where management has no incentive to do anything -- it just sits there,&quot; says Stephen Joseph, a senior vice president at Drexel Burnham.    Value. Many thrifts that rank high according to all the other criteria are selling at sky-high multiples, compared with historical levels. While the biggest, &quot;best and brightest&quot; thrifts, such as Ahmanson, Great Western Financial and Golden West Financial are still highly recommended by most analysts, &quot;they're already selling at multiples comparable to commercial banks,&quot; says Smith Barney's Mr. Treadway.    Consequently, &quot;investors may get more relative appreciation in medium-sized thrifts, many of which still sell at multiples of between six and eight times this year's earnings,&quot; Mr. Peltz says. Among his picks are First Federal of Michigan, Great Lakes Bancorp and Standard Federal Bank in the Midwest, as well as Apple Bank for Savings and Home Savings Bank in New York.    Aside from the big blue-chip California thrifts, Montgomery's Mr. Jolson likes SFFed, HomeFed, UnionFed Financial, Westcorp and Heart Federal.    Stephen Lieber, who runs the Evergreen Fund, takes a long-range view. He looks for thrifts he thinks will eventually be taken over by commercial banks or become commercial banks themselves. His choices include New England thrifts such as Peoples Bancorp of Worcester, Midhudson Savings Bank and First Constitution Financial. In a similar vein, Freedom Capital's Mr. Schmidt likes Missouri's United Savings andamp; Loan as a bargain-priced long-term takeover play in the Midwest.    ---@ A Thrift Sampler @ This is a sampling of the thrift-institution stocks analysts are recommending @ PRICE/ @ EARNINGS CLOSING @ RATIO* PRICE** @ H.F.
