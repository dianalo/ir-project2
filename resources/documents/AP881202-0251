Ross Johnson said in a jointletter with Henry R. Kravis, a principal in the investment firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   ``However, that process has ended and it is now most importantthat we return immediately to actively and vigorously running ourbusiness,'' said the letter, sent Friday to RJR's 120,000 employeesworldwide.   Addressing the concern of employees about their futures, theletter also attempted to assure employees them that ``all of yourexisting health and medical plans, and all of your retirement andpension plans will continue in full force and effect.''   The letter also said Kohlberg has ``great flexibility and isunder no pressure to make immediate divestitures.''   Nevertheless, the letter confirmed press accounts that the newowner anticipated ``that the sale of $6 billion in various foodassets is likely to occur over the next twelve to twenty-fourmonths.''   There was no further indication of what those assets were, butthe letter told employees ``we can also assure you that there willbe no mass liquodations of our assets, or any mass layoff ofemployees. Both our goal and commitment is to grow this company in amost responsible manner.''   Johnson was outmaneuvered by Kohlberg in a spectacular biddingwar for the nation's 19th largest industrial company, maker ofhundreds of products that range from Camel cigarettes to Oreocookies to Triscuit snacks.   The struggle climaxed late Wednesday when RJR's directorsaccepted Kohlberg's $109-a-share, $24.53 billion package of cash andsecurities, the biggest takeover agreement in history.   Kohlberg won despite a seemingly higher $112-a-share, $25.2billion package of cash and securities offered by Johnson and hisfinancial backers, defying widespread predictions that the scrappyRJR boss would win.   The directors concluded both offers were substantially the sameand opted to go with the investment firm's because of itsestablished record in takeovers and its commitment to preserving asmuch of the company as possible, post-mortem accounts of thedecision showed.   They also were said to be dismayed at the brazen greed exhibitedby Johnson, who originally offered $75 a share for the company inwhat he admitted was a deliberate buy-low approach.   Johnson was said to feel cheated by the board's announcement andhis first reaction was to reiterate he believed his final offer wasbetter. He also dropped hints the battle was not over, saying he was``exploring my options.''   But the joint letter with Kravis showed he had scrapped any plansto challenge the board's decision.   Both offers were for leveraged buyouts, a high-financetransaction in which the buyer puts up only a fraction of thepurchase price and borrows the rest, repaying it with the targetcompany's earnings, sale of assets or both.   The highly publicized struggle focused new attention on leveragedbuyouts because they saddle companies with enormous debt and oftenlead to their breakup. There is growing concern over whetherleveraged buyouts are playing a harmful role in the economy.   Kohlberg's takeover of RJR will more than quadruple the company'sdebt to nearly $24 billion, raising speculation the new owner willhave to sell substantial parts of the Atlanta-based giant to servicethat debt.</TEXT></DOC>
