The schedulealso requires that vessels of any nation falling under ``higher fee'' criteriawould pay an additional incremental amount of 67.42 percent of their poundagefees. No nation will be required to pay the additional incremental amount.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On November 1, 1988, NOAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR)for a 30-day public comment period at 53 FR 44047. NOAA proposed a foreignfee schedule at the level of fees charged in 1988. This schedule was foundto be in accord with provisions of section 204(b)(10) of the Magnuson Act(16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3>)Section 204(b)(10) states, in part, ``The fees * * * shall be at leastin an amount sufficient to return to the United States an amount whichbears to the total cost of carrying out the provisions of this Act * ** during (FY 1988) the same ratio as the aggregate quantity of fish harvestedby foreign fishing vessels within the Exclusive Economic Zone during (1987)bears to the aggregate quantity of fish harvested by both foreign and domesticfishing vessels within such zone and the territorial waters of the UnitedStates during (1987).'' (16 U.S.C. 1824(b)(10)(B)). The fiscal and calendaryears applied for determining compliance of this fee schedule are shownabove (see 53 FR 44047).Section 204(b)(10) also states that if the Secretary of Commerce, in consultationwith the Secretary of State, finds a fishing nation to be ``harvestinganadromous species of United States origin at a level that is unacceptableto the Secretary'', or ``failing to take sufficient action to benefit theconservation and development of United States fisheries'', in other words,meeting a ``higher fee'' criterion, subparagraph 204(b)(10)(C) applies.Subparagraph 204(b)(10)(C) requires the Secretary to impose fees for thatnation which are based on the ratio of the fish harvested by foreign vesselsin the Exclusive Economic Zone to the aggregate quantity of fish harvestedby both foreign and domestic vessels in the Exclusive Economic Zone only.Removing the quantity of U.S. harvested fish caught in the territorialwaters from the formula increases the ratio and thereby the fees that thenation must pay.The NPR reviewed the procedures, assumptions and estimates used by NOAAto conclude that a foreign fee target based on the fees charged for catchesof each species in 1988 and on estimates of 1989 allocations would exceedthe amount calculated by assuming $200 million costs for activities tocarry out the purposes of the Magnuson Act in FY 1988 and a 1987 foreigncatch of 2.6 percent of the total catch in the Exclusive Economic Zoneand the U.S. territorial waters. A poundage fee target for the foreigncatches of $6.420 million was proposed and an additional amount of $354per vessel was proposed for processing 1989 fishing permit applications.The surcharge for the Fishing Vessel and Gear Damage Compensation Fund(FVGDCF) was proposed to be waived since the fund contains sufficient capitalfor paying claims for the duration of foreign fishing in the ExclusiveEconomic Zone.Only one timely comment was received and the comment addressed the speciesfee for Atlantic Mackerel. Several late comments addressed the same issue.The comments advocated a reduction in the fee on the poundage for Atlanticmackerel harvested directly by foreign vessels. Allegedly, reducing thisfee would allow foreign processing vessels to pay higher prices to U.S.fishermen who sell Atlantic mackerel catch to them. The purpose would beto attract more U.S. fishermen into that fishery. The commenters said thatthe prescribed ratios of domestic production, joint venture productionand directed fishing which bear on approval of foreign fishing applicationsfor the Northwest Atlantic Ocean fishery affect the profitability of Atlanticmackerel operations. NOAA considered similar comments when it adopted thefinal fee schedule for 1988. Changes were made prior to implementationof the final 1988 fee schedule to address trade and development implications.The adjustments made in the 1988 schedule specifically took into accountthe concerns in the Atlantic mackerel fishery. A change in the mackerelfee could shift a disproportionate fee burden to the Pacific whiting fisheryif allocations for foreign fishing are made in 1989. NOAA believes it hasexercised as much flexibility as possible under the Magnuson Act with respectto the Atlantic mackerel fishery. No change is made in response to thiscomment. NOAA adopts the species fees assessed in 1988 for the final 1989fee schedule. The poundage fee target for 1989 is $6.420 million. Permitapplication fees of $354 will be charged for each foreign fishing application.No nation will be charged the higher incremental fees of 67.4 percent ofits poundage fees. The surcharge for the FVGDCF is waived for 1989. TheDepartment of State concurs in this fee schedule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>NOAA prepared an RIR for the 1988 fee schedule that discussed the economicconsequences and impacts of the fee schedule and alternatives. Since NOAAproposed no changes for 1989, conclusions of the RIR for the 1988 feesschedule were also not significantly changed. Copies of the final RIR areavailable at the above address. Based on the RIR, the Administrator, NOAA,determined that the proposed schedule does not constitute a major ruleunder Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291). The RIR demonstrates that thefee schedule complies with the requirements of section 2 of E.O. 12291.The General Counsel for the Department of Commerce certified that the proposedfee schedule will not have a significant economic impact upon a substantialnumber of small entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3> This certification was forwarded to the Chief Counselfor Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. Because the fee schedulewill not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number ofsmall entities, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.The proposed fee schedule has no direct impact on the fishery resourcesin the Exclusive Economic Zone. At the most, a fee schedule might affectthe harvesting strategy of foreign fishing vessels; however, the scheduleas set out in the final rule meets the criterion that fees should minimizedisruption of traditional fishing patterns because the 1989 fees are directlyrelated to exvessel values and are designed to minimize effects on U.S.fishery development and trade. Since this fee schedule will not preventthe harvesting of the available total allowable level of foreign fishing(TALFF), and the environmental impact of harvesting the TALFF is describedfor each fishery management plan, no further environmental assessment isnecessary.The 30-day delay in implementation required by the Administrative ProcedureAct is waived so that the fee schedule can be implemented near the beginningof the fishing season. This action does not require changes in plans orstrategies by foreign fishing companies since it makes no change from thefee which applied in 1988.The final rule has no information collection provisions for purposes ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> This rule would not directly affect the Coastal zone of any state withan approved Coastal Zone Management program. Neither does the rule containpolicies with federalism implications sufficient to warrant a federalismassessment under Excutive Order 12612.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 611</ITAG>Fish, Fisheries, Foreign relations, Reporting requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
