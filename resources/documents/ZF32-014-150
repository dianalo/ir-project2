Buckholtz, commissioner of the General ServicesAdministration's IRM Service; Robert Veeder, acting chief of the InformationPolicy Branch at the Office of Management and Budget; Rona Stillman, theGeneral Accounting Office's chief scientist for computers and communications;and Allen Hankinson, chief of the Systmes and Software Technology Division ofthe National Institute of Standards and Technology.andM;The lineup gave rise to the hope that something positive might come out ofthe conference.andP;  But that was not to be.andP;  Current IRM management concernswere aired, but, as at so many similar conferences, none of the speakers hadpractical solutions to these lingering problems.andM;Buckholtx acknowledged the importance of strategic planning and ofidentifying areas of addded value.andM;He urged the adoption of standards and streamlining the acquisition process,including mandatory selection of off-the-shelf products.andP;  The GSAcommissioner spoke of his agency's plan to foster software licensing by siteor agency and said he wants GSA to simplify hardware benchmarkingrequirements.andM;He emphasized a new paradigm, one in which users take a horizontallyintegrated, mission-oriented view of their IT needs rather than beingpreoccupied with specific technologies or technical tools.andM;Rather than try to build their own technology infrastructure, Buckholtz wantsagencies to develop an information architecture.andM;All of these are fine goals, but not exactly new ideas.andP;  For one reason oranother they have not been put into effect, or if adopted, cannot beenforced.andM;Veeder, of OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, reviewed thebudget environment.andP;  He predicted a tight fiscal 1993 after a relativelygenerous fiscal 1992, when IT expenditures will reach about $23 billion.andM;GAO's Stillman probably gave the most provocative presentation.andP;  First shehigh-lighted GAO's avowed goal for big systems acquisitions: Bring in suchprojects on time, within budget, in accordance with stated functionalspecificatioins and truly meeting agencies' mission objectives.andM;Through the government, she said, systems should share data, as well as takeadvantage of reusable code wherever possible.andP;  The procurement process isrisk-averse, while the bigger system projects with their multiyeardevelopment cycles are risk-intensive.andP;  Those in charge of approving suchcomplex procurements demand a degree of certainly regarding functionalspecifications that simply is unachievable, except maybe for the first yearof a project.andM;As a result, project managers are forced to assert more than they canpossibly know, Stillman said.andP;  And emphasizing short-term expediency, theprocess does not reward those who forthrightly look at the longer-term.andM;Instead the process motivates IRM managers, who want to protect their careersabove all else, to overstate what can be done over a given time frame andunderstate the costs, in order not to risk losing this or next year's budgetallocations.andM;Radical RemediesandM;In other words, as Stillman explicitly stated: Big-system delways hard toimplement, fail in the federal government because under the prevailingacquisition rules they are beset by systemic problems well beyond the controlof the agency's IRM managers.andM;Stillman laid out remedies that a restructured procurement process mustinclude:andM;* Appropriate rewards and allowance for long-term risk taking in the face ofuncertainty about functional requirements and technological opportunities.andM;* Close linkage of projects to agency mission to avoid authorizinglow-added-value programs.andM;* Flexibility in budgeting, such as use of ranges for estimating long-termcosts, in recognition of risk and uncertainty.andM;* Continuous oversight of important projects to detect and avert significantrisks.andM;She suggested a simultaneous top-down and bottom-up approach to implementwhat she recommends, which also is what most IRM people long have agreedneeds to be done.andM;A-B-Cs of IRMandM;Most IRM managers and observers of the government IT scene hve heard all thisbefore -- the systemic procurement-related issues and the proposed remedies,which almost always fly in the face of political or bureaucratic realities.andM;In response to questions Stillman agreed that her ideas for solving some ofthe systemic problems probably were non-starters.andM;Throughout the meeting the spiritual presence of Paul Strassmann was felt.andO;The speakers and the audience frequently referred to the need for truly opensystems, for  embedding IT into the functional businesses of the agencies,and for users to become mission-oriented rather than technology-driven.andM;The term &quot;value-added&quot; and its importance in measuring return on ITinvestment, the key to Strassmann's carefully crafted methodology, definitelyhas become part o the federal IRM vocabulary.andP;  If Strassmann succeeds at thePentagon, his recipe may be adopted at most major civilian agencies.andM;Ulric Weil is president of Weil andamp; Associates, a Washington consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
