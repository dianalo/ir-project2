That's the conclusion of Stein Roe andamp; Farnham, a Chicago investment adviser. Irked by the performance of some of its funds, Stein Roe has scuttled its habit of running funds by committee and now is relying on solo portfolio managers.    &quot;Too many cooks spoil the stew -- especially in the investment game,&quot; says Michael Hirsch, chief investment officer of Republic National Bank of New York. &quot;Very rarely does the committee system work.&quot;    The overwhelming majority of the nation's approximately 3,000 mutual funds are run by a single portfolio manager, a strategy sometimes known as the &quot;star system.&quot; A handful of funds, such as Twentieth Century Investors, are successfully run by a team approach, with investment decisions made by several managers.    The major benefit of the committee approach is that funds rarely suffer when a manager leaves or changes strategy, as can occur with funds under the helm of a single captain. But critics contend that it's more effective to have one person calling the shots.    Performance was the driving factor in Stein Roe's decision, fund officials say. Stein Roe executives were unhappy with the returns of several funds, particularly the $200 million Stein-Roe Stock Fund. Although the fund has surged nearly 25% so far this year, its five-year performance barely matches the average of all general stock funds. The firm's equity funds typically have been solid bull-market funds but poor bear-market portfolios, industry executives say.    &quot;The bottom line (of the switch) is to get better results,&quot; says Marshall Front, a Stein Roe partner.    Pay levels at Stein Roe also played a part. The firm's officials wanted to make it easier to link managers' compensation to performance. &quot;To the extent you can do that, it motivates people better,&quot; Mr. Front says.    Stein Roe contends that the switch to single managers has gradually taken place over the past couple of years, even though on paper the funds have always been run by committee, which involved two or three managers. Stein Roe manages 16 funds with assets of $3.4 billion.    Separately, the firm recently shuffled several funds. It merged its Universe and Discovery portfolios, for instance, into its Capital Opportunities Fund to reduce expenses for some holders. And the company renamed its high-yield fund because it held relatively few junk bonds. The new name: SteinRoe Corporate Bond Fund-Investment Grade.    &quot;Stein Roe has never been active in the junk market, and we didn't want the fund to represent itself that way,&quot; Mr. Front says. </TEXT></DOC>
