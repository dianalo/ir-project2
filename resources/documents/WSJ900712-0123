Several years ago, two businessmen there tried and failedto get permission from local government to build a system tocompete with the officially anointed cable operator. So theywent to court, and the lawsuits flew. As one local regulatorput it, Sacramento became &quot;the cable-television litigationcapital of the world.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The two entrepreneurs now have their competing systemrunning, though with unexpected twists. For one thing, theysurvived partly by switching technology. Today, their systemhas very little cable; it relies, instead, on an over-the-airmicrowave transmission system known as &quot;wireless cable.&quot; Andlocal government, which fought so hard to keep them out, isnow cheering the entrepreneurs on.   With much of the nation wired for cable television andmajor markets dominated by media giants, the cable industrywould hardly seem to be a place for would-be entrepreneurs toplay. Yet as the Sacramento example illustrates, evolvingtechnology and changing attitudes by local governments may bemaking the cable business a more hospitable and lucrativeplace for the little guy to compete.   Traditionally, local governments have given out exclusivefranchises to individual cable companies and fought fiercelyto protect those monopolies from would-be competitors.Defenders of this approach argue that cable television, likeutility service, is a natural monopoly with capital costs toogreat to support more than one system. They note that in anumber of competitive situations where a second cable systemwas actually built, one company ended up buying the other.   But local government support for competition in the cableindustry is growing, partly because of dissatisfaction withrising prices and poor service. In Huntsville, Ala., forinstance, competition between two cable companies has drivendown the price for some program services to half of what isbeing charged in surrounding communities and in some casesbelow the wholesale cost of the service itself, says WilliamG. Jackson, president of Cable America Corp, one of thecompetitors. As a result, adds Mr. Jackson, &quot;we are gettinginvited into a lot of other cities.&quot;   By contrast, when Sacramento real-estate developers JosephBenvenuti and D. Bruce Fite formed Pacific West Cable in theearly 1980s, local government officials did all they could toinvite the two entrepreneurs out of the cable business. Thecity and county gave an exclusive franchise to SacramentoCable Television Co., which is a subsidiary ofCincinnati-based media giant E.W. Scripps Co.   Up to 5% of Sacramento Cable is owned by several dozenprominent local citizens, who each put up $2,000 for sharesthat are worth many times that today, says Richard Esposto,executive director of the Sacramento Metropolitan CableTelevision Commission, the local regulatory body. Givingownership chunks of a franchise for little or no money topolitically powerful local citizens has been a commonpractice in the cable industry.   Cable companies have often paid governments dearly forexclusive franchises, which in recent years have also beenlargely free of rate regulation. Besides annual franchisefees, Sacramento Cable promised to financially support publicaccess channels to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars amonth. (It didn't have to keep the promise after competitorswere let in.)   From the beginning, Pacific West refused to make suchoffers, says Pacific West's chairman, James Kirschman. &quot;Wefelt the city was just using the franchise system to getcompanies to pay for things they didn't have money for,&quot; hesays.   After its application was turned down in 1983, PacificWest filed suit in federal court in Sacramento, claiming,among other things, that local government was abridging itsfree-speech rights. In 1987, a jury agreed and found that thegovernment's arguments in favor of just one cable operatorwere a &quot;sham&quot; designed to increase payments to localgovernment and campaign contributions to local politicians.   After that, Pacific West was given a license to startbuilding a competing system, as was Cable America, which hadalso filed an application. Then new problems started.   Both companies say that as soon as they started installingtheir cables, Sacramento Cable began cutting prices in thoseareas, while maintaining them elsewhere. Mr. Jackson, theCable America president, recalls talking to one customer whohad just signed up for free service from Sacramento Cable.&quot;He said he would take free service from us, too, and thencancel the first company that sent him a bill,&quot; recalls Mr.Jackson.   Cable America eventually sold its Sacramento system to theScripps subsidiary. &quot;We couldn't compete,&quot; Mr. Jackson says.   Pacific West says it couldn't compete either. In 1988 itfiled a suit, still pending, in Sacramento federal court thatcharges Sacramento Cable with &quot;predatory pricing.&quot; Besideslow prices, Sacramento Cable offered such sign-up inducementsas free television sets, says Pacific West's Mr. Kirschman.   John Moorhead, an attorney for Sacramento Cable, says thatlike other businesses his client has a right to setcompetitive prices. He adds that all of Sacramento Cable'spricing actions have been &quot;fair and equitable&quot; and that thecompany plans to vigorously defend itself against the PacificWest lawsuit. He says that at most a handful of freetelevision sets were offered.   Besides going back to court, Pacific West turned to adifferent technology by merging last year with anIllinois-based wireless cable company. With wireless cable,Pacific West simply puts up a small antenna at the customer'shome.   Though Pacific West's customer base of 5,000 subscribersis still dwarfed by the 180,000 signed up with SacramentoCable, Pacific West is beginning to have an impact, says Mr.Esposto, the cable commission chairman. Consumers are usingthe threat of switching cable companies to get better serviceand prices, he says. &quot;Pacific West has gone from being a foeto a friend. Its presence has been very, very useful.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
