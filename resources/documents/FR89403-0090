DPR-42 and DPR-60,issues to Northern States Power Company (the licensee), for operation ofthe Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, Units Nos. 1 and 2, locatedin Goodhue County, Minnesota.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment</ITAG>Identification of Proposed actionThe proposed amendments would revise the technical Specifications (TSs)by deleting the steam/feedwater mismatch flow in coincident with the lowfeedwater flow reactor trip.The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application foramendment dated July 18, 1988 as supplemented by letters dated September15, 1988 and March 10, 1989.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed changes to the TSs is required in order to permit the installationof a new feedwater flow control system that will result in a significantimprovement in plant reliability.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision tothe Technical Specifications. The proposed revision would eliminate thereactor trip dealing with low steam generator water level coincident withsteam/feedwater mismatch flow. This proposed change does not impact onthe reactor licensed thermal power level. Since the evaluation demonstratesthat the plant does not exceed the acceptable thermal limits, the proposedchange does not increase the probability or consequences of accidents,no changes are being made in the types of any effluents that may be releasedoffsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individualor cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commissionconcludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiologicalenvironment impact.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change tothe TSs involves systems located within the restricted area as definedin 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradioloical plant effluents andhas no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 8, 1989, (54 FR 6201). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the final Environmental Statements related to the Prairie Island NuclearGenerating Plant Unit Nos. 1 and 2 dated May 1973.Agencies and Person ConsultedThe Commission's staff review the licensee's request and did not consultother agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated July 18, 1988, and supplemented by letters dated September15, 1988 and March 10, 1989, which is available for public inspection atthe Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and the Technology and Science Department, Minneapolis Public Library,300 Nicollet Mall, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 28th day of March 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Dominic C.
