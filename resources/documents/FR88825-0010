This change is being made becauseof complaints about highway traffic delays. This action will accommodatethe current needs of vehicular traffic and still provide for the reasonableneeds of navigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>These regulations become effective on September26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Brodie Rich, telephone (305)536-4103.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On March 24, 1988, the Coast Guardpublished proposed rules (53 FR 9671) concerning this amendment. The Commander,Seventh Coast Guard District, also published the proposal as a Public Noticedated April 5, 1988. In each notice, interested persons were given untilMay 9, 1988, to submit comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The drafters of these regulations are Mr. Brodie Rich, project officer,and Lieutenant Commander S.T. Fuger, Jr., project attorney.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>One hundred and twenty-eight comments were received. One hundred and twenty-twosupported the proposal or expressed no objection. Five commentors opposedany change to existing regulations expressing that further restrictionson navigation imposed by a more restrictive regulation would necessitatevessel traffic divert around the bridge, and considered this regulationchange unreasonable to meet the present needs of navigation. One of theobjectors indicated that the proposed regulation change would cause adverseeconomic impacts on the marina located on the southwest corner of the DodgeIsland bridge known as Miamarina. This regulation change would relievepresent vehicular traffic conditions resulting from the steadily increasingvolume of passengers destined to and from the passenger port facilitieslocated on Dodge Island. The scheduled closure periods, will still affordopportunities for vessels to transit the bridge periodically through theday on Saturday including three midday openings between 11:15 a.m. and12:15 p.m., and normally scheduled openings after 2:00 p.m. In addition,since there exists an alternate route around this drawbridge, the minimumdisruption of waterway access resulting from this regulation is not consideredto be an unreasonable burden to navigation. This regulation will only bein effect until the high-level fixed bridge presently under constructionis completed, which will provide uninterrupted direct highway access fromthe mainland to Dodge Island (the Port of Miami). The final rule remainsunchanged from the proposed rule published on March 24, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment and Certification</ITAG>These regulations are considered to be non-major under Executive Order12291 on Federal Regulation and nonsignificant under the Department ofTransportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979).The economic impact has been found to be so minimal that a full regulatoryevaluation is unnecessary. We conclude this because the regulations exempttugs with tows. Since the economic impact of these regulations is expectedto be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that they will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117</ITAG>Bridges.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulations</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, Part 117 of Title 33, Code of FederalRegulations, is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 117_DRAWBRIDGE OPERATION REGULATIONS</ITAG>1.
