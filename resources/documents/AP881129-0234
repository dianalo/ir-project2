The Commerce Department said the performance of the grossnational product, the broadest measure of the economy, slowed in theJuly-September period after expanding at an annual rate of 3.2percent during the first six months of the year.   It was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986, whenthe economy grew at a sluggish 1.4 percent rate. The department saidthat without the drought third-quarter growth would have been astrong 3.2 percent.   The report, however, represents an upward revision from apreliminary estimate last month, which pegged growth at 2.2 percent.The revisions were about in line with economists' expectations andfit in with anticipation in the market that the Federal Reserve willsoon move to curb inflation by dampening growth with higher interestrates.   Major banks raised their prime lending rates on Monday.   The Commerce Department also reported today that corporateprofits rose a slight 0.2 percent in the third quarter, to $163.1billion, the worst performance since a loss in the last quarter of1987.   In another report Monday, the Commerce Department said theimbalance between what the United States imports and exportsnarrowed to $28.53 billion in the July-September quarter, a 5.4percent decline. It was the third straight quarterly drop.   Through the first nine months of the year, the deficit ran at anannual rate of $125.2 billion, compared with last year's record$160.3 billion deficit. Analysts predicted the deficit for all of1988 should be at least 20 percent lower than 1987, marking thefirst time since President Reagan took office in 1981 that the tradedeficit has improved.   Reagan policymakers have relied heavily on the dollar's declinein value over the last three years to increase exports by makingthem more affordable abroad, and thus help ease the trade deficit.   The Commerce Department report suggested the strategy has been atleast partly successful, easing some pressure for the dollar todecline more.   Another event that helped the dollar Monday was an Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries accord aimed at limiting productionand raising the price of oil, which often is priced in dollars.Higher OPEC prices raise demand for dollars to pay for the oil.   The OPEC pact reached in Vienna, Austria, was viewed skepticallyby many industry analysts, given the cartel's history of violatingits own agreements, but it still pushed oil prices up more than $1to the $15-a-barrel level.   Meanwhile, major U.S. banks boosted their prime lending rates ahalf percentage point to 10.5 percent, the steepest level sincemid-1985 and the fourth rise this year.   The prime rate rise had been widely expected, but some analystssaid it also contributed to a strengthened dollar, which rose invalue against the Japanese yen, British pound, West German mark andother key currencies.   The dollar's strength helped the bond market, where the 30-yearTreasury bond rose about $2.50 per $1,000 in face amount and itsyield fell to 9.14 percent from 9.17 percent Friday.   But the impact was hardly felt on Wall Street, where the numbersof gaining and losing issues were about even in New York StockExchange trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.76to 2,081.44, and broader market indicators were mixed.</TEXT></DOC>
