On the eve of his departure, Bush received a new message fromWest German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is pushing for superpowertalks to slash arsenals of short-range nuclear missiles _ the issuethat separates Washington and Bonn. However, presidential spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said the two sides were still at an impasse.   ``The consultations are about where they have been,'' Fitzwatersaid. ``The issue is still an open one ... but it has not beenresolved at this point.''   He said ``time is running out'' on chances to resolve thequarrel before the leaders of the 16 NATO countries meet inBrussels on Monday. Playing down the dispute, Fitzwater said, ``Wedon't believe it will overwhelm or dominate the summit and itshould not and will not be allowed to.''   Bush's trip _ his first to Europe as president _ will take himto Italy, Belgium, West Germany and England.   The journey is an important step for Bush as he tries toestablish himself as a world statesman and attempts to counter thesuccess of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in projecting himselfas a peacemaker with a series of promises to cut military spending,arms and troops.   Coming on the heels of Ronald Reagan's series of five summitswith Gorbachev and the signing of a major U.S.-Soviet armsagreement, ``Bush is between a rock and a hard place,'' saidUniversity of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.   ``The rock is Reagan and the hard place is Gorbachev. Betweenthe two giants he's coming out on the short end,'' Sabato said.   Norm Ornstein, a political analyst at the American EnterpriseInstitute, said European leaders all know Bush and regard him with``a sense of predictability and familiarity.   ``At the same time, I don't think there's a sense of awe or afeeling we've got somebody in there who can keep up withGorbachev,'' Ornstein said.   He said Bush ``needs to show that the leader of the free worldis going to be just that.''   Before arriving in Brussels, Bush will spend two nights in Rome.He will meet with Italian leaders, have an audience with the PopeJohn Paul II and deliver an address previewing the NATO summit. Thespeech site is the American cemetery at Nettuno, the burial site of7,850 men and 12 women who were killed in World War II.   He will go to Bonn after the summit for a two-day visit and thenstop in London before flying to his vacation home in Kennebunkport,Maine, on June 2.   The NATO summit was intended an as anniversary party toastingthe strength of the Western Alliance and celebrating 40 years ofpeace in Europe.   However, the missile dispute with Bonn has marred the atmosphere.   The rift was triggered by Germany's demand for the United Statesand the Soviet Union to begin negotiations soon to reduce andpossibly eliminate nuclear missiles on both sides with a range ofup to 300 miles.   Bush has opposed opening talks, saying he would not go alongwith any steps leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons inEurope. In a gesture of compromise, Bush agreed last week to theprinciple of negotiations, but under conditions that would put offany talks for years.   The West German government also is resisting a jointU.S.-British effort to more than triple the range of Lance missilesto just below 300 miles. All U.S. and Soviet missiles with rangesbetween 300 and 3,000 miles were banned under a 1987 treaty.   The U.S.-built Lances now can hit targets from about 75 miles.Most of the 88 launchers, carrying about 700 single-warheadmissiles, are based in West Germany.   ``It's nothing new that a new president faces a test fromMoscow,'' said Burton Pines, senior vice president and director ofresearch at the Heritage Foundation. ``The first test of Bush isnot coming from Moscow. It's Bonn which is testing the newpresident.''   ``It's going to be a crossroads summit,'' said William J.Taylor, vice president for political-military affairs at the Centerfor Strategic and International Studies.   ``Our forecast for at least the last six years has been that bythe late 1980s, NATO cohesion would be under serious challenge andthere was a reasonable probability of the disintegration of NATO,''he said.   Bush rejects that kind of scenario. ``I have a feeling thatthere's been a lot of smoke and that we'll have a good summit,'' hesaid recently.   ``This alliance is not going to fall apart. It is going to staytogether and be strong,'' Bush said.   However, the administration readily acknowledges there are majorstrains on the alliance.   ``The glue that has kept it together and has overcome all thedivisive issues that always plague the alliance _ it's always introuble _ the glue has been the threat of the Soviet Union,'' saida senior administration official, one of the top advisers to Bush.   ``Well, you know, maybe that's not true anymore, and there's agrowing perception that, hey, there isn't going to be an attack inEurope. So we need to infuse the alliance with some new unifier,''added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
