WATSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   A bomb killed one person and wounded seven Monday at a protest of``The Satanic Verses'' in India, and Britain said Iran's order tokill author Salman Rushdie was a ``fearful example of whereintolerance may lead.''   Activists in Moscow demonstrated for Rushdie outside the IranianEmbassy.   In Karachi, Pakistan, a bomb exploded at the British Councillibrary while it was closed Sunday night, killing a guard.   At least 18 people have been killed in India and Pakistan sinceFeb. 12. Both countries have banned the novel.   Syria said it banned ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslemsconsider blasphemous, a month ago and suspended all dealings withViking Penguin, the publisher. The Information Ministry said the banincludes any other publishing house that translates or distributesthe book.   Moslem theologians meeting in Mecca, the holy city of Islam,branded Rushdie a ``heretic and a renegade'' Monday but did notendorse murdering him. Islamic law condemns heretics to death, butonly after they are tried and refuse to repent.   In London, the government refused a request by British Moslems toextend the blasphemy law to all religions. It now covers only theAnglican faith.   Rushdie, 41, was born into a Moslem family in Bombay, India, buthas become a British citizen and does not actively practicereligion. The writer has been in hiding and under heavy police guardsince Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered his death.   He has apologized for any distress ``The Satanic Verses'' causedMoslems, but Iran rejected the apology.   A senior Viking Penguin editor attending an emergency meeting inLondon of the Writers' Guild of Great Britain said Monday hardbackcopies of the novel were selling so well that a paperback edition,due out in August, may be delayed for ``crude commercial'' reasons.   He denied reports that Viking Penguin might cancel the paperbackedition to appease Moslems.   Khomeini, Iran's 88-year-old revolutionary patriarch, ordered hisfollowers Feb. 14 to kill Rushdie for blaspheming Islam and theprophet Mohammed. Iranian clerics put a price of $5.2 million on theauthor's head.   Nigeria's Supreme Council of Moslems said Monday it supports thedeath sentence. A Moslem student group in Africa's most populouscountry also demanded action against Nigerian author Wole Soyinka,the 1986 Nobel Literature laureate, for defending his fellow writer.   About 300 Moslems demonstrated at the British consulate in Kadunain the Moslem-dominated north. They carried placards condemningRushdie and Soyinka, one of which said ``Soyinka Must Die.''   Rushdie got support Monday from about 15 unofficial politicalactivists and journalists in Moscow who shouted ``Shame on Khomeini!Shame on Islam!'' outside the Iranian Embassy.   Soviet media have published reports from abroad about thecontroversy but have not commented editorially, and the Kremlin hassaid nothing.   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, touring the Middle East,met with Khomeini in Tehran on Sunday. Iran's official news agencyindicated they did not mention Rushdie or ``The Satanic Verses.''   A statement distributed by the Moscow protesters said: ``Whileall the civilized world is outraged'' by the death sentence, ``theSoviet government as usual remains silent.''   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain was in Paris for asummit with the French president, Francois Mitterrand, and told anews conference that defending Rushdie ``is a fundamental matter offreedom of speech.''   ``We cannot have other people inciting their own citizens tomurder one of our citizens, and on that we had to be very firm,''she said.   Iran's parliament has scheduled a vote for Tuesday on whether tobreak relations with Britain.   Mitterrand told the journalists: ``In an affair of this kind,when dogmatism and fanaticism create a totally irrational situation,one must of course expect anything.''   Michel Rocard, the French premier, said any demonstrations urgingviolence against Rushdie would result in criminal charges.   British chief delegate Henry Steel told the U.N. Human RightsCommission in Geneva the Khomeini incitement to murder was a``fearful example of where intolerance may lead'' and ``raises .. .grave issues'' for the 43-nation commission, at which Iran hasobserver status.   The bomb in India exploded in Srinagar, summer capital ofJammu-Kashmir state, where a crowd was trying to enforce a strike toprotest a confrontation Friday in Bombay. Police fireed into thecrowd in Bombay, killing nine people.   Press Trust of India said the bomb was intended for police whowere trying stop demonstrators from forcing shops to close. The newsagency said a Moslem civilian was killed and a police officer wasamong the wounded.   Several protests have been held in India, particularly inJammu-Kashmir, the only state in the overwhelmingly Hindu nationwith a Moslem majority.   Karachi police said an explosive device weighing about to poundswent off at the British Council library. It demolished the guardroom, killing Mohammed Shafi, 65, and damaged a section of theoutside wall, they said.   Britain's blasphemy law applies to material found to revile,vilify or insult God, Jesus Christ, the Bible or the beliefs ordoctrines of Christian churches. In the most recent case, themagazine Gay News and its editor were fined a total of $2,600 in1977 for publishing a poem suggesting Jesus Christ was a homosexual.It was the first prosecution for blasphemous libel since 1922.</TEXT></DOC>
