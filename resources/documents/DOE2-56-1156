Vacuum solutions are studied andinterpreted as cosmological models. Fluid solutions are also consideredand are seen to represent inhomogeneous cosmological models that becomehomogeneous at t{yields}{infinity}. A subset of them evolve toward isotropicFriedmann--Robertson--Walker metrics.</TEXT></DOC>
