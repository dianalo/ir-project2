Terms weren't disclosed.    The subsidiaries are Childrens Press and Regensteiner Printing Co. The transaction will be completed before year's end, according to the company.    Officials for Chicago-based Regensteiner Publishing couldn't immediately be reached for comment.    Childrens Press, a publisher of textbooks, had sales of approximately $22 million in 1986. Regensteiner Printing, a commercial printing operation, had sales of $34 million. Grolier said it plans to divest itself of the Regensteiner Printing unit, upon completion of the transaction.    John Winter, president of Childrens Press, and Frederick Glazer, president of Regensteiner Printing, will retain their positions, Grolier said.    For the first six months of the year, Grolier had net income of $11 million, or 70 cents a share, on revenue of $191 million. Grolier, an educational publisher, also markets children's books and products as well as photo-finishing services.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Grolier closed yesterday at $15 a share, down 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
