A loss for the quarter was reported by InterFirst Corp., and lower earnings were reported by RepublicBank Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp.    Along with Citicorp, other companies reporting higher fourth-quarter earnings were Chase Manhattan Corp., Bank of Boston Corp., Security Pacific Corp., Wells Fargo andamp; Co., Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Norwest Corp. The increases ranged from 1.2% by Bankers Trust to 60% by Wells Fargo.    Last week, 10 major bank holding companies reported higher fourth-quarter results. Analysts have estimated that banks on average would report earnings gains of about 10% for the quarter.    In Texas, results at RepublicBank and InterFirst, two of the state's biggest bank holding companies, suggest there still isn't an end in sight to the energy and real estate loan problems that have rocked them all through 1986. Their results were worse than most analysts had predicted.    The stocks of the companies showed mixed results yesterday, all in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Security Pacific common shares closed up $1 at $40.75, while Bankers Trust closed down $2.125 at $47.875 and Wells Fargo closed down $1.375 at $107.75. Others showed smaller gains or losses or were unchanged.    Citicorp   Citicorp's fourth-quarter earnings climb reflected increases in the company's consumer banking and institutional investment banking operations. Citicorp said its traditional corporate banking business also had an earnings increase, despite &quot;the continued high level of write-offs.&quot;    Earnings from investment banking products unrelated to institutional clients were down from a year earlier, because of lower trading results and rapid expense growth.    Fourth-quarter earnings were increased $38 million by a change in the tax treatment of the New York-based company's leveraged lease portfolio.    Citicorp said operational expenses rose 23% in the quarter.    The company's provision for possible loan losses increased in the quarter to $508 million from $394 million a year earlier. For the year, the provision was $1.83 billion, compared with $1.24 billion in 1985.    Total reserves for possible credit losses at year's end were $1.7 billion, or 1.30% of total loans and leases, compared with $1.24 billion, or 1.06% of total loans and leases, at year-end 1985.    Total assets climbed to $196.1 billion from $173.6 billion in 1985.    Earnings for the sector known as the individual bank rose 49% in the quarter to $130 million.    Citicorp said it had strong revenue from its credit-card businesses and its New York branch system.    The company also earned $228 million from the delivery of institutional banking and investment banking products, an increase of 85% from last year's fourth quarter. This sector includes a $46 million reduction in deferred taxes made possible by changes in the tax laws regarding leveraged leases.    RepublicBank   Fourth-quarter profit at Dallas-based RepublicBank, Texas's second-largest bank holding company, plummeted from year-earlier levels, reflecting a $53.5 million charge for possible loan losses.    The 41-bank holding company, with $20.9 billion in assets, said nonperforming loans jumped $61 million in the fourth quarter to $853 million, or a troublesome 5.7% of total loans and other assets. The bulk of the increase in nonperforming loans was in real estate lending, RepublicBank said.    Also, in the quarter, RepublicBank had net loan write-offs of about $45 million consisting primarily of commercial loans.    The weak performance reflects the continuing loan problems that emerged with a vengeance for nearly all Texas banking concerns early last year, as oil prices dropped, real estate values collapsed and the Southwest sunk deeper into a recession. RepublicBank's slim profit would have been even smaller, were it not for a $13 million adjustment that boosted leveraged lease income as a result of a federal tax law change, and a $6.1 million after-tax gain from the sale of securities.    RepublicBank's net interest rate margin -- the difference between what a bank receives on loans and other assets and what it pays for deposits -- strengthened slightly in the fourth quarter to 3.23% from 2.98% at Sept. 30, but the year-earlier margin was a healthier 3.64%. Also, the company said its non-interest expenses were even with last year, reflecting RepublicBank's effort to cut general expenses.    InterFirst   The fourth-quarter loss of InterFirst, which RepublicBank proposes to acquire, far exceeded expectations of analysts. Many were predicting that the troubled bank holding company would manage a modest profit or break even in the final quarter.    But InterFirst's real estate loans continued to deteriorate, refecting the general recession in Texas, and some $40 million in energy loans that the Dallas-based bank holding company had previously earmarked for possible loan loss were finally written off.    The fourth-quarter net loss reflected a $60.2 million loan-loss provision. Deterioration in its loan portfolio raised nonperforming loans to $1.09 billion, or an ominous 8.2% of total loans, from $742 million, or 3.4%, at year's end 1985. About half its nonperforming assets are real estate loans, reflecting the fact that real estate loan problems and the general economic recession in Texas continue to dig deeper into banking operations.    The bulk of InterFirst loan write-offs were for energy loans, followed by souring real estate loans and general commercial borrowings.    Chase Manhattan   Chase Manhattan's fourth-quarter profit rose because of higher net interest income and increases in fee-based businesses.    The New York bank holding company's fourth-quarter earnings also benefited from an estimated $9 million after-tax gain stemming from changes in the tax laws affecting leveraged lease financings. Profit in the year-earlier quarter was boosted by a $15 million after-tax gain from the sale of real estate in Japan.    Fourth-quarter earnings increased 14% from the third quarter of 1986.    In the 1986 fourth quarter, the provision for possible loan losses increased to $140 million from $125 million a year earlier. For the year, the provision increased to $595 million from $435 million in 1985. Chase said both increases represent higher consumer loan write-offs coupled with a rapidly expanding consumer loan portfolio and &quot;the continuing uncertain conditions&quot; in some developing countries.    Net loan write-offs in the quarter increased to $123 million from $104 million. For the year, write-offs increased to $475 million from $320 million.    The reserve for possible loan losses at year's end was $1.06 billion, or 1.61% of total loans, compared with $908 million, or 1.47% of total loans, in 1985.    Total assets at year's end were $89.8 billion, compared with $86.3 billion in 1985.    Manufacturers Hanover   A previously announced charge of $33.5 million to buy back debt securities sent Manufacturers Hanover's earnings plunging in the quarter. The New York-based company said that without the charge, fourth-quarter earnings would have been $108.9 million, or $2.38 a share, up slightly from a year earlier.    Still, earnings in the quarter benefited from some unusual fourth-quarter events, such as gains of $29.3 million after taxes from the sale of Manhattan real estate and after-tax earnings of $28.3 million related to changes in the tax law affecting the company's leveraged lease portfolio.    The company also recorded sharply higher revenue in its investment banking businesses, including its venture capital and financial advisory services. These increases also stemmed in part from increased investor activity driven by the changes in the tax bill.    Provisions for possible loan losses in the quarter increased to $301.7 million from $205.6 million. For the year, the provision was $858.9 million, up from $622.8 million in 1985.    Net write-offs in the quarter increased sharply to $247.1 million from $143 million. Write-offs in the quarter included $64.4 million in energy credits.    The reserve for loan losses at year's end rose to $1.01 billion, or 1.79% of total loans, from $813.8 million, or 1.39% of total loans, at the end of 1985.    For the year, total assets dropped to $74.39 billion from $76.52 billion.    Security Pacific   Los Angeles-based Security Pacific's earnings for the quarter and year, fueled by a substantial jump in non-interest income, showed strong growth despite a hefty rise in loan-loss reserves. The company also had a big tax credit in the quarter.    Non-interest income for the quarter rose 40% to $415.8 million, and includes pre-tax gains of about $18 million from the sale of a mortgage unit and about $17 million resulting from the recent acquisition of Arizona Bancwest Corp. For the year, non-interest income rose 37% to $1.41 billion.    Non-interest income for the quarter also included a near doubling of gains on equity security sales to $56.3 million, a 36% increase in loan fees to $62.8 million, and a 30% increase in service charges collected on deposit accounts, to $58.8 million.    Net interest income for the quarter was off 2.4% to $454.2 million. The interest spread narrowed to 3.90% from 4.39%. For the year, net interest income rose 6% to $1.8 billion. Recent tax-law revisions resulted in a $21.7 million downward adjustment to the quarter's net interest income. But Security Pacific's earnings were boosted by a $67.1 million tax credit, compared with a tax expense of $35.6 million a year earlier. No tax credit was taken for the year.    Provision for loan losses in the quarter rose 33% to $199.6 million, and rose 33% to $502.9 million in the year. Loan write-offs for the quarter decreased 40% to $83.6 million, and for the year decreased 4.7% to $336.5 million. Nonperforming loans at year-end were $1.20 billion, down 1% from the third-quarter level but up 6.2% from year-end 1985. Net return on average assets for the quarter was 0.69%, off fractionally from 0.70% a year earlier and for the year also was 0.69%, off from 0.71%. Return on equity for the quarter was 16.1%, up from 15.5%, and for the year was 15.5%, unchanged.    Bankers Trust   Bankers Trust New York's earnings edged up as increases in non-interest income, net interest income and lower taxes were offset by a higher loan-loss provision and increased non-interest expense.    Pre-tax non-interest income in the quarter increased to $346.7 million from $238.7 million in the year-earlier quarter. That included pre-tax gains of about $72 million on the sale of the company's Wall Street property and $43 million from settlement of a portion of the company's pension obligations.    Foreign exchange trading income, however, dropped sharply in the quarter to $100,000 before taxes from $39.3 million.    The company recorded a fourth-quarter tax benefit of $33.3 million, compared with a tax expense of $37.2 million a year earlier. The tax reduction stemmed primarily from the treatment of certain leasing activities, resulting from changes in the tax laws.    The provision for possible loan losses in the quarter rose substantially to $188 million from $45 million in the year-earlier period. The increase reflected heightened concerns on the part of the company about &quot;the domestic and international economies.&quot;    Net write-offs for the quarter increased to $52.3 million from $27 million.    At year's end, the company's allowance for loan losses increased to $590.7 million, or 2.2% of average total loans, from $427.6 million, or 1.73% of average total loans, at year-end 1985.    Total assets increased to $56.4 billion at year's end from $50.6 billion.    Wells Fargo   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo's May 1986 acquisition of Crocker National Bank continued to pay off in soaring profit. The company said it expects to complete the conversion of Crocker branches to Wells Fargo branches in California in the first quarter of 1987.    Return on average assets for the quarter rose to 0.72%, compared with 0.67% in the year-earlier quarter. Return on average assets for the year rose to 0.73%, up from 0.67% in 1985.    Net interest income for the fourth quarter rose 49% to $489.7 million, and for the year rose 31% to $1.7 billion. The interest rate spread was 5.12% for the quarter, up from 4.99%, and 5.09% for 1986, up from 4.93%.    Non-interest income for the fourth quarter rose 30% to $139.2 million, and for the year rose 16% to $459.6 million. In 1985, non-interest income included gains of $50.2 million from the sale of a mortgage banking unit and $55.5 million on investment securities transactions, including $20.3 million in the fourth quarter. That compares with $29.4 million in gains on investment securities transactions for 1986, including $5.2 million for the fourth quarter.    Net loan write-offs for the quarter totaled $75.4 million, up from $69.8 million, and for the year totaled $279 million, up from $211.6 million.    Nonperforming loans fell to $970.7 million, or 2.6% of total loans at year-end, from $988.9 million, or 2.9% of total loans at the end of the third quarter of 1986. Troubled loans totaled $789.8 million, or 3.2% of total loans, at the end of 1985.    Other real estate, obtained primarily in settlement of troubled loans, totaled $319.6 million at the end of 1986, up from $238 million at the end of the 1986 third quarter and $169.3 million at the end of 1985.    Bank of Boston   Bank of Boston, continuing to benefit from the healthy New England economy, cited strong loan growth, increased fee income and higher income from venture capital investments for its robust results. Acquisitions made in June 1985 and November 1985 also contributed to this year's increased earnings.    The bank holding company said its annualized return on equity for the fourth quarter rose to 17.06%, and to 16.18% for the year, up from 12.78% in the year-ago quarter and 13.72% for 1985.    Net interest income -- the difference between interest paid on deposits and interest collected on loans -- rose 26% in the fourth quarter to $307.8 million; excluding the effect of acquisitions, net interest income rose 22%. Income from venture capital investments was $8 million for the fourth quarter and $33 million for the year, compared with break-even results in the year-earlier quarter and $13 million for 1985.    The provision for credit losses in the latest quarter was $65 million, up from $25 million. The company said the higher provision reflects an increase in loans and leases and a 31% increase in net write-offs to $39.3 million for the quarter.    The company also said controls on operating expenses contributed to higher earnings. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, expenses rose 8% for the quarter and 11% for the year.    Norwest   Norwest's fourth-quarter results were buoyed by a decline in nonperforming assets, by a 19% earnings jump at its consumer finance subsidiary and by a turnaround in its mortgage banking operations, which earned $5.3 million compared with a year-earlier loss of $5.4 million.    Those results offset a 14.2% rise in Norwest's provision for loan losses, which grew to $82 million in the period. Like other big banks in the fourth quarter, Minneapolis-based Norwest recognized deterioration in its portfolio of foreign loans, which totaled about $647 million at year's end. About half of that is held by Mexico and Brazil. Largely because of concern about the clouded Third World debt picture, Norwest boosted its reserves for future loan losses 17% to $316.7 million at year's end.    Norwest's consumer finance unit reported profit of $22.1 million in the fourth quarter and $70.8 million for the year. Loan write-offs for the entire holding company fell to $201.6 million in 1986 from $218.8 million. Nonperforming assets -- mainly bad loans and real estate acquired through foreclosure -- declined to $418.7 million from $512.6 million.    ---                            1986            1985                       in       per     in       per    %                    millions   share  millions  share  chg.
