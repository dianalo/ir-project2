The culprit is Western news media.   Worldwide television broadcasts of police beating peopleprotesting for democratic reform in East Berlin, Leipzig andelsewhere have pushed the Communist government to bitterdenunciations.   One party newspaper condemned the ``gang of Western reporters,''while East Berlin's official news agency accused Westernjournalists of working in cooperation with the demonstrators.   During protests, police roughed up journalists, smashed cameras,confiscated film and ordered some photographers and televisioncrews to leave the East German capital immediately. They alsodetained at least two journalists before letting them go severalhours later.   Until recently, large street protests were a rarity in a countrywhose government traditionally blamed its woes on Western agentsand an allegedly unfriendly government in Bonn. Television footageof unrest was scarce.   But over the last month, that has changed.   An exodus of at least 50,000 East Germans to West Germany sinceSept. 11 emboldened those left behind to speak out and protestduring a weekend visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev onEast Germany's 40th anniversary.   Gorbachev attracted dozens of Western correspondents andtelevision crews anxious to know what he told East Germany'shard-line leader, Erich Honecker, who has rejected the reformsembraced by some East bloc allies.   Consequently, the many foreign journalists accredited to coverGorbachev's visit were on hand to hear the thousands of EastGermans who want reform.   In East Berlin and five provincial cities, police over theweekend beat and arrested hundreds and perhaps thousands ofprotesters.   East Germany's leaders were angered. The first broadside came onSunday, after thousands of protesters filled East Berlin's mainsquare.   ``In the evening hours of Oct. 7, troublemakers tried to disturbthe people's celebrations for the 40th anniverary of the GDR (EastGermany),'' the state news agency, ADN, said. ``In cooperation withWestern news media, they banded together in the Alexanderplatz(East Berlin's main square) and nearby areas and called out slogansagainst the Republic.''   Among the slogans the protesters chanted was, ``Gorby, Gorby,help us!''   The East German government tried to clamp down on reportingSunday, declaring whole areas of the capital off-limits tophotographers. That included a Lutheran church that has become thefocal point for East Germany's growing opposition movement.   ``Wherever the gang of Western reporters went, especially thetelevision crews, certain types showed up seconds later and startedtrouble,'' the Communist Party youth newspaper Junge Welt charged.   But, as if to balance hostility to the Western news media, thenewspaper also said that its own photographer's camera had beensmashed in the weekend clashes.   The nation's official newspapers printed Sunday's ADN dispatchcalling the pro-democracy demonstrators ``troublemakers.''   West Germany lodged an official protest against the East Germaninterference with the Western journalists, but the East Germangovernment's diplomatic mission in Bonn rejected the allegations.   West Germany's ARD television network also lodged a protest,saying the East Germans' interference with its reporters' workviolated ``international rules and regulations,'' including theHelsinki accords.</TEXT></DOC>
