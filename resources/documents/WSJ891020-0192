The 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the Constitution.    The vote, in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. Bush's position, was a victory for Democratic leaders, who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights. &quot;We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution,&quot; said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine.    In order to defuse pressure for an amendment, Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change. Mr. Bush said he would allow the bill to become law without his signature, because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately.    In June, the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration, saying he was &quot;engaging in political expression&quot; that is protected by the First Amendment. </TEXT></DOC>
