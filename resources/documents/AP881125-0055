(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A congressional investigator says damage atthe Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant from radioactive materials andtoxic chemicals may be irreversible and even the plant's defendersadmit a cleanup would be costly.   The Rocky Flats plant, which makes weapons components fromplutonium, has become the target of safety and environmentalconcerns over the years. There have been fires, lawsuit settlementsand studies showing higher cancer rates and plutonium contamination.   ``I don't believe that it's possible to reverse the harm that hasbeen done at Rocky Flats,'' said Bob Alvarez, who works for the U.S.Senate's governmental affairs committee, which monitors nuclearweapons complexes.   ``I don't think you can retrieve the stuff (solvents mixed withplutonium) that's migrating down to the groundwater'' at RockyFlats, said Alvarez.   The 385-acre plant site 16 miles northwest of Denver issurrounded by a 6,550-acre, federally owned buffer zone.   Fred Dowsett, head of the Colorado Health Department's wastemanagement division, said concentrations of hazardous compounds insome groundwater on the plant site are 20,000 times above thedrinking water standard.   But Dowsett said that in itself poses no threat to localresidents.   ``The nature of the plant, with a large security zone around it,means groundwater contamination is confined to the area of theplant,'' he said. ``There's a large uninhabitated buffer zone beforeit can get off site.''   Officials say all 107 waste sites at Rocky Flats are closelymonitored. The monitoring also has intensified in recent years, theysaid.   But they acknowledge it might cost hundreds of millions, if notbillions, of dollars to undertake an effective cleanup.   William Fenzel, a General Accounting Office investigator whoheaded a recent safety study of Rocky Flats, likened predictinggroundwater flow to forecasting Colorado weather.   The Department of Energy and its contractor, RockwellInternational, have conceded they lack sufficient information aboutgroundwater migration, Fenzel said, because they have decided todrill 200 additional test wells around the plant during the next fewyears.   He said that raises questions about just how polluted the siteactually is.   ``I think the severity of the problem is such that even if theyspend an enourmous amount of money on cleanup, areas of the sitestill may be restricted for decades and even possibly centuries,''he said.   Since Rocky Flats opened in 1952, large quantities of toxic,carcinogenic chemicals and radioactive materials have been handledat the plant. During the plant's first 25 years of operation, manyof those materials were dumped at the site.   Some of the deadliest substances _ plutonium, uranium, americiumand chlorinated solvents like trichloroethylene, or TCE;tetrachloroethylene, PCE; and carbon tetrachloride _ will remain inthe plant's groundwater and soil for decades, if not longer.   Energy Department and EPA officials acknowledge that errors inwaste disposal were made in the plant's early years, but theycontend that past and present efforts to clean up some of the wastesites have been successful, and that levels of contaminants are toolow to pose severe health threats.   ``My professional opinion is that a lot of the contamination canand will be remediated,'' said Nat Miullo, who oversees the plantfor the EPA.</TEXT></DOC>
