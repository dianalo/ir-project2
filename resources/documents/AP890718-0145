KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Democratic-controlled Senate, reflectinglingering political fallout from the Iran-Contra affair, votedTuesday to forbid a president from soliciting foreign or privatefunds to carry out foreign policy activities prohibited by Congress.   The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,passed 57 to 42. Moynihan said the aim was to bar governmentofficials from bending to pressure from superiors to conductactivities outlawed by Congress.   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., voting on the losing side,protested that the amendment ``is a clear, bald effort to usurp theforeign policy prerogatives of the president of the United States ina manner not allowed by the Constitution.'' He predicted thatPresident Bush will veto it.   The provision, attached to pending legislation authorizing $4.6billion in spending for the State Department and allied agencies,would make violators subject to fines and jail terms of up to fiveyears.   Testimony before the congressional Iran-Contra committees showedthat the Reagan administration had solicited millions of dollarsfrom American citizens, and from such nations as Saudi Arabia andBrunei, to circumvent a congressional ban on direct U.S. aid to theContra rebels battling the Marxist government of Nicaragua.   One-time presidential aide Oliver L. North testified that he hadhelped arrange such unofficial assistance to the Contras.   ``This amendment can be summed up in three words: `Obey thelaw'!'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.   Mitchell noted that Helms contends the president is fullyempowered to pursue his policies by indirect means even whenCongress has outlawed a direct approach using U.S. government funds.   ``The president of the United States is constrained by law justas is any American citizen,'' Mitchell said in disagreement.   ``This is a democracy, not a monarchy. The president is not aking,'' he said.   ``This is a modest, reasonable response to ensure there will becompliance with law,'' Mitchell said. ``It will prevent officials ofthe government from having to choose between loyalty to thepresident and loyalty to the Constitution. This amendment says thatif the law prohibits an act, it is prohibited indirectly as well asdirectly.''   But Helms replied: ``The opposition to this amendment can besummed up in three words: `Obey the Constitution'!''   He said that Bush would be fully justified in vetoing the measure.   Helms contended that in foreign policy issues Congress has thepower only of the purse, with the ability to cut off governmentfunds for a given activity. But Congress cannot bar a president frompursuing foreign policy by other means, he said.   Voting for the amendment were 53 Democrats and four Republicans.One Democrat and 41 Republicans opposed it. One senator did not vote.</TEXT></DOC>
