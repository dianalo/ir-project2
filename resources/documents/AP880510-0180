Carlucci toldCongress on Tuesday.   ``I do not believe law enforcement, making arrests, isappropriate'' for the military, Carlucci said. ``I think it isunwise to get the military into the law enforcement question.''   ``Do we shoot people? Do we shoot down planes?'' he said at ahearing of the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee.   Carlucci was trying to deal with a rising wave of sentiment inCongress that the military should be used more heavily to block theflow of illegal drugs into the United States.   Last week the House voted 385-23 to order President Reagan tohave the military seal the U.S. borders against drug traffickers.   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said earlier this week thatHouse leaders are drafting an anti-drug bill that will increase themilitary role.   Rep. Bill Nichols, D-Ala., asked the Pentagon on Tuesday todevelop within 10 days a plan for using military resources to stopthe cross-border drug flow.   Nichols, chairman of the House armed services investigationssubcommittee, made his request after a hearing at which abipartisan group of lawmakers also chastised Pentagon officials fortheir reluctance to increase military involvement in the war ondrugs.   ``We recognize that this is a mission that you would enter intowith some degree of concern,'' Nichols said. ``It's not the normalduties that have been assigned to the military. ... But I have toask myself, if not the military, then who? We're not getting thejob done.''   Nichols said he wants the Pentagon's drug interdiction planready for subcommittee hearings later this month in Miami and ElPaso, Texas.   The Senate is expected to debate and vote on similar proposalsthis week as the chamber works on its version of a Pentagon budgetbill. One of the Senate amendments is being written by Sen. SamNunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee.   Military enforcement of civilian laws is banned by an 1878 law,the Posse Comitatus Act, but Congress amended the law six years agoto allow the Pentagon to share some information with civilian lawenforcement agencies.   Since then, Carlucci noted, military planes and ships routinelyhave given information to law enforcement officials, including theDrug Enforcement Administration. Coast Guard personnel ride aboardNavy ships in the Caribbean Sea to make drug arrests.   ``Thousands and thousands of planes fly across our bordersannually with drugs,'' Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., told Carlucci.``Either we're going to have a war on drugs and get the militaryinvolved or we're not.''   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said, ``We're at war here and wethink the people to be handling a war are in the Department ofDefense.''   Carlucci answered that ``I agree that there is a war on, but Ibelieve it is a different kind of war than the military is involvedin.''   ``We can do a certain amount of this and we are doing themaximum,'' Carlucci said of current anti-drug efforts.   ``The military are not trained for the law enforcementmission,'' Carlucci said. ``To suddenly tell them you're in lawenforcement, you have to shift the entire focus, the training. ...There's a major difference between military and police work. Ourpeople are not trained to read Miranda rights, they are trained toshoot to kill.''   At the House hearing, Grant Green, assistant secretary ofdefense for force management and personnel, said, ``We need to lookat what we as a country can realistically accomplish in (drug)interdiction. We can't just say, `Seal the borders in 30 days.'''   Green said using the military to close U.S. borders to drugtraffickers would cost a minimum of $20 billion and harm Pentagonreadiness.</TEXT></DOC>
