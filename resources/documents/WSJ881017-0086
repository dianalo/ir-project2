Mr. Murdock is believed to be one of six parties, including Remington Products Inc. Chairman Victor Kiam, who have recently submitted reorganization proposals to Allegheny. The Pittsburgh-based consumer products company, unable to generate support for its own reorganization plan, had asked interested groups to present plans by Oct. 10. Allegheny refused to comment on the plans.    Sources close to Allegheny said the other groups who have submitted plans include: Odyssey Partners, a New York leveraged buy-out firm; Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities; and Paul Levy, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert investment banker. Mr. Murdock's plan was made public because he has a significant stake in the company.    Mr. Murdock is chairman and chief executive officer of Castle andamp; Cooke Inc., and through his Pacific Holding Co. is also the largest shareholder. Castle andamp; Cooke is a Los Angeles-based company with interests in food, transportation equipment and real estate.    Mr. Murdock has been considered more closely aligned with Allegheny than other investors, having supported management in a contentious proxy fight. His plan, contained in a letter to Allegheny Chairman Oliver S. Travers, was made public in a filing last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    It calls for Pacific Holding to inject about $40 million in new capital into Allegheny, consisting of $25 million in cash and an unidentified wholly owned subsidiary valued at $15 million.    Pacific Holding also would arrange $315 million in financing for the reorganization plan and an additional $100 million of bank credit for working capital for the reorganized Allegheny. Mr. Murdock said that, based on discussions with banks, he is &quot;confident that such facilities can be arranged.&quot;    Under the Murdock plan, secured creditors would be repaid in full, while senior unsecured creditors would receive as much as 90% of their loans -- compared with 70% in the company plan. Allegheny's current holders of common and preferred shares would be left with 25% of reorganized company, and would be offered additional stock in a $10-a-share rights offering. Pacific Holding would have a 29.7% stake, but could boost its ownership to 57.7% by exercising stock purchase warrants.    Allegheny, which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code last February, submitted its own reorganization plan earlier in the summer. The company plan provides for 100% payment to creditors of Alleghey's main operating subsidiaries and leaves current equity holders with 25% of the reorganized company. Allegheny's plan receives exclusive consideration by the bankruptcy court in Pittsburgh until Oct. 27.    Mr. Murdock, in the SEC filing, said a condition of his reorganization plan is that he and Allegheny must reach a definitive agreement by Oct. 28.    Both the equity holders and unsecured creditors have asked the court to consider their own plans. The equity committee, which wants to oust current management, said in its bankruptcy court filing that it had been in discussions with Mr. Kiam. The group said Mr. Kiam planned to submit his own plan but would be &quot;amenable to becoming the operator and an investor under the equity plan, should it be accepted.&quot;    Mr. Kiam couldn't be reached for comment.    Both the equity and unsecured creditors committees are expected to evaluate the six reorganization plans submitted to Allegheny, in order to determine which proposal they will support. </TEXT></DOC>
