The Act is administered bythe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through theOffice of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), Marine and EstuarineManagement Division (MEMD).Public Law Number 100-627 (November 7, 1988) reauthorized, and amended,Title III of the Act. Section 205 of Public Law No. 100-627 directs theSecretary of Commerce to submit to Congress a prospectus pursuant to therequirements of section 304 (a)(1)(C), and (a)(5) of the Act (16 U.S.C.1434 (a)(1)(c) and (a)(5)) with respect to the feasibility of designatingWashington State Nearshore (Northern Puget Sound) as a National MarineSanctuary not later than March 31, 1991. Selection of a site as an ActiveCandidate formally triggers the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)environmental impact analysis process.In preparing the prospectus, MEMD will develop a draft environmental impactstatement and draft management plan which will include any proposed regulationsneeded to implement the terms of the proposed designation. Subsequent stepsinclude public hearings; preparation of a final environmental impact statement,final management plan, and final regulations; preparation of DesignationDocumentation and Findings; and designation by the Secretary of Commerce.Opportunities for comment exist throughout this process and will be announcedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the local media, and other appropriate channels.In the development of the Sanctuary designation materials, NOAA will evaluatethe suitability of Northern Puget Sound as a National Marine Sanctuaryin accordance with the criteria established by section 303(a) of the Act,16 U.S.C. 1433(a), namely whether:(1) The area is of special national significance due to its resource orhuman-use values;(2) Existing State and Federal authorities are inadequate to ensure coordinatedand comprehensive conservation and management of the area, including resourceprotection, scientific research, and public education;(3) Designation of the area as a National Marine Sanctuary will facilitatecoordinated and comprehensive conservation and management of the area,including resource protection, scientific research, and public education;and(4) The area is of a size and nature that will permit comprehensive andcoordinated conservation and management.Further, pursuant to section 303(b) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 1433(b) NOAAshall consider:(1) The area's natural resource and ecological qualities, including itscontribution to biological productivity, maintenance of ecosystem structure,maintenance of ecologically or commercially important or threatened speciesor species assemblages, and the biogeographic representation of the site;(2) The area's historical, cultural, archeological, or paleontologicalsignificance;(3) The present and potential uses of the area that depend on meaintenanceof the area's resources, including commercial and recreational fishing,subsistence uses, other commercial and recreational activities, and researchand education;(4) The present and potential activities that may adversely affect thefactors identified in considerations number 1-3 listed above;(5) The existing State and Federal regulatory and management authoritiesapplicable to the area and the adequacy of those authorities to fulfillthe purposes and policies of the Act;(6) The manageability of the area, including such factors as its size,its ability to be identified as a discrete ecological unit with definableboundaries, its accessibility, and its suitability for monitoring and enforcementactivities; (7) The public benefits to be derived from sanctuary status, with emphasison the benefits of long-term protection of nationally significant resources,vital habitats, and resources that generate tourism;(8) The negative impacts produced by management restrictions on income-generatingactivities such as living and non-living resource development; and(9) The socioeconomic effects of Sanctuary designation. NOAA will alsoinclude an assessment of it fiscal capability to manage the area as a NationalMarine Sanctuary.In preparing the environmental impact statement and management plan (EIS/MP)to examine the management and regulatory alternatives associated with Sanctuarydesignation, NOAA will solicit comments from interested persons, groupsand organizations, the appropriate Congressional committees, heads of interestedFederal agencies, the responsible officials of the State, local and Tribalgovernments and the appropriate officials of the affected Regional FisheriesManagement Council. This will be done during scoping meetings to be heldin the State of Washington prior to preparation of the EIS/MP, during publichearings to receive comments on the draft EIS/MP, and throughout the EIS/MPpreparation period.<ITAG tagnum="84">History</ITAG>The Washington State Nearshore (Northern Puget Sound) site was first recognizedfor its high natural resource potential and human-use values by placementon the National Marine Sanctuaries Program Site Evaluation List (SEL) onAugust 4, 1983 (48 FR 35575). In 1988, when Congress reauthorized and amendedthe Act, it specified in section 205 of Public Law No. 100-627 that NOAAsubmit, not later than March 31, 1991, a prospectus to the Committee onMerchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives and to theCommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in the Senate with respectto the proposal to designate Northern Puget Sound as a National MarineSanctuary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Natural Resources</ITAG>Oceanographic CharacteristicsThe Northern Puget Sound study area can be categorized as a two layeredestuarine type circulation system. This system consists of a predominantupper layer of fresh water, reflecting major discharges from the Fraserand Skagit Rivers, as well as contributions from lesser rivers and streamsin Puget Sound. The second bottom component is a denser more saline layerof water that flows landward from the Pacific Ocean through the Straitof Juan Du Fuca.Other physical properties are then superimposed on this estuarine-typesystem and contribute to the complexity of the oceanographic characteristicsof the area. The daily ebb and flow of the tides, and their associatedtidal currents, add another dimension to the circulation pattern. Springtide heights ranging from 10 to 13 feet and tidal currents of 1\1/2\ to2\1/2\ knots are common in this area.The combination of fresh and seawater causes turbulent mixing by the tidalcurrents found in the area. As a result, the net water found within theSound is variable and is constantly seeking equilibrium from the freshwater input and ocean water supplies that change seasonally. Water in PugetSound is most diluted in February, after the landward sources have receivedthe maximum precipitation, and is most saline around late October whencontributing river flow is at its lowest point.While the oceanography of Northern Puget Sound will be dealt with as adefined unit, research shows that because of the complexity of the topographicand bathymetric features of this area, this water body can be divided intodistinct water units depending on its location and the intended use withinthe system. Geologic FeaturesNorthern Puget Sound has been geologically defined by a combination ofplate tectonic stresses and glacial processes that have occurred in thearea over time. These geologic activities have created a series of deepU-shaped, inter-connected channels such as the Haro and Rosario Channelsthat surround the San Juan Islands, and the Juan De Fuca and Georgia Straitswhich are typical of glacially scoured channels. The bathymetry of thedeep water passages, that average 150 meters in depth within the studyarea, is characterized by shoals and banks.Glacial activity is also responsible for the predominantly rounded shapeof the San Juans and surrounding smaller islands and for the numerous rockdeposits found along the shoreline of the Sound.The shoreline of the study area also shows evidence of historical glacialactivities with its combination of rocky shores, gravel, cobble and sandtypes as well as mudflats and mixed mud bottom areas.Flora and FaunaThe study area lies within the transitional biogeographical zones of theOregonian and Skatian sub-provinces with waters extremely rich in plantand animal life. As a result, Northern Puget Sound supports a wide selectionof marine life that directly contributes to the complex foodweb and supportsthe economically and culturally important fisheries industries as wellas the varied mammal and bird populations found within the area.Several species of birds migrate through or reside permanently within theproposed study area. It is recognized as one of the most important winteringareas of the Pacific Flyway with over 100 species of birds identified.Marine bird species are also abundant within the area, with as many shorebirdsrepeatedly sited. Foremost among the bird population is the bald eagle.The area supports the largest concentration of bald eagles in the contiguousUnited Staes with several documented nesting sites and a wintering populationof over 200 eagles. Other predominant bird species include the RhinocerosAuklets, Ring-billed gulls, Caspian Terns, and American Black Oystercatchers.Several hundred species of invertebrates and algae are abundant in thewaters of Northern Puget Sound. This resource is a direct contributor tothe productive fish and shellfish industry in the study area. Dominantmigratory fish species include, but are not limited to, salmon, trout,anchovy, pollack, herring and halibut. Abundant resident species commonto the area include the cabezon, lingcod and rockfish. The study area alsosustains several species of crabs, clams and oysters, and a productiveshellfish industry exists.Marine mammals including seals, sea lions, porpoises, river otters andfive types of whales, two of which are on the Federal endangered specieslist inhabit Northern Puget Sound at various times of the year.As evidenced by the diversity of animals found in Northern Puget Sound,several species depend on this area as an important feeding and breedingsite critical to their continued existence. Examples of these species includethe harbor seal, river otter, false killer whale, herring, trout, and fivespecies of salmon. In addition, Protection, Smith and Colville islandshave been identified as three of the largest breeding locations for marinebirds on the Pacific coast in North America.<ITAG tagnum="84">Human use</ITAG>The waters of Northern Puget Sound have traditionally supported multipleuse activities. Currently, because of the size and number of populationcenters located on land surrounding the Sound, the study area is subjectedto direct and secondary effects of these land based activities.The natural beauty of Northern Puget Sound and surrounding waters is visitedby thousands of tourists annually to enjoy the natural resources of thearea. The proximity of this proposed sanctuary to Seattle, the fastestgrowing metropolitan city in Washington, has increased the demand for recreationalfacilities in Northern Puget Sound and as a result, boating, sport fishing,shellfish harvesting, whale watching tours, national historic parks, theWhale Museum, and the Padilla Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve allserve as recreational activities available to tourists in the area.Commercial and subsistence fisheries also play a critical role in the economyand culture of Northern Puget Sound. Many Indian Tribes utilize the watersof the study area as part of their traditional fishing grounds. These tribesmaintain and operate separate fishing industries, including aquaculturefacilities, that are cooperatively managed with the State of Washington.Both Tribal and non-Tribal user groups depend on the clean waters of theSound to continue commercial fishing activities and to support increasingaquaculture operations.The diversity of species found in Northern Puget Sound has provided a naturallaboratory for the scientific research conducted by the University of Washington'sFriday Harbor Lab since 1904. Critical base line data and surveys havebeen compiled over the years and the Lab is internationally recognizedfor its research facilities and contributions to marine science.Numerous archeological sites have been identified in Northern Puget Soundthat are of historical value; evidence of past settlement including tools,harpoons, and shell middens have been found along coastal boundaries. Twenty-threehistoric shipwrecks have been identified in the waters of the study area.Work continues in the field to examine historical relics of past cultures.Oil and gas exploration is prohibited within the proposed sanctuary underthe provisions of the State Shoreline Act. However, the area is heavilyutilized by oil tankers that enter the Sound from the Strait of Juan DeFuca to transfer oil products at the four refineries located landward ofthe study area.The U.S. Navy maintains a military air base on Whidbey Island, landwardof the study area and, as a result, continuous overflights occur withinthe range of the proposed sanctuary area.Existing Protection of Marine ResourcesSince this proposed marine sanctuary is located entirely within State controlledwaters, Federal, State, Tribal and local agencies all have concurrent programresponsibilities to manage and protect selected marine resources and toprovide education and recreation opportunities within Northern Puget Sound.Only agencies with major marine protection responsibilities will be identifiedin this notice.The San Juan County National Wildlife Refuge encompasses 83 refuge islandswithin the San Juan archipelago. It serves as a breeding ground and nestingcolony for several species of seabirds, including puffins and winged gulls.San Juan Island, Dungeness Spit and Protection Island National WildlifeRefuges are all managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These areasprovide breeding and nesting colonies for several species of birds andmammals that inhabit the waters within the study area.The waters surrounding San Juan County were designated a Biological Preserveby the State of Washington in 1923. This designation requires individualsto obtain collecting permits from the Director of the University of Washington'sFriday Harbor Lab to remove biological materials, other than for personaluse, from the waters of San Juan County and Cypress Island.Both commercial and recreational fisheries are cooperatively managed bythe Pacific Fisheries Management Council, the Treaty Tribes of WesternWashington, the Pacific Salmon Commission, the Washington Department ofWildlife, the Department of Natural Resources, the National Marine FisheriesService, and the Washington Department of Fisheries. Aquaculture withinthe study area is managed by the State of Washington Departments of Ecology,Fisheries, and Agriculture, as well as the Treaty Tribes of Western Washington.Water quality in Northern Puget Sound is monitored and managed by the PugetSound Water Quality Authority, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyand the Washington State Department of Ecology. The U.S. Coast Guard regulatesvessel traffic, including boating safety, within the Sound. Scheduled maintenanceof harbors, ports and channels, including dredge and fill disposal, isunder the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District.The Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, isresponsible for the protection of whales, dolphins and other pinnipeds,while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife regulations provide protection for allother marine mammals within the study area.The Designation ProcessThe draft management plan to be prepared for the proposed Sanctuary willspecify the goals and objectives of Sanctuary designation and describeprograms for resource protection, research, education, and interpretation.The various administrative and regulatory alternatives for sanctuary managementwill be analyzed in the draft environmental impact statement.Opportunities for public participation in NOAA's development of a draftenvironmental impact statement and management plan will be provided throughscoping meetings, solicitation of comments on the draft environmental impactstatement/management plan and proposed regulations, and public hearings.The November scoping meetings will identify issues regarding the designationof the Washington State Nearshore (Northern Puget Sound) National MarineSanctuary and generate suggestions for addressing them. The following areexamples of discussion topics:(1) Boundary alternatives;(2) Management alternatives;(3) Resource protection;(4) Research opportunities; and(5) Interpretive opportunities.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John J.
