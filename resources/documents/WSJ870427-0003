But in recent days, currency-market intervention by central banks has become routine, and its effectiveness has come under question.    On Friday, for example, seven major central banks intervened in markets around the world, buying dollars and selling yen. The U.S. currency eventually stabilized at 139.38 yen, just above a 39-year low against the Japanese currency set in intraday dealings. Still, that was down 0.9% from the previous day's level. And against the West German mark, the dollar's plunge was steeper and continued throughout the day.    The dollar continued to fall sharply Monday morning in Tokyo. In early trading there, the dollar was quoted at 137.40 yen, down 1.5% from Friday's level.    The dollar's plunge Monday prompted Japan's central bank to intervene once again. Further intervention by central banks this week is almost certain, traders say, because of continued bearish market sentiment about the dollar. Recent agreements between the U.S. and its major trading partners commit them to coordinated action to bring stability to the currency markets. But currency traders are showing a will to take on the central banks.    Central banks generally keep quiet about their currency-market activities. But New York traders strive to follow the Fed's moves anyway. &quot;It's a good guessing game,&quot; Arnie Sherrer, chief foreign exchange trader at Royal Bank of Canada's New York branch, says. Once the central banks have been spotted in the market, he says, &quot;the news travels fast.&quot;    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York handles foreign exchange matters for the Federal Reserve System and intervenes on orders from the Treasury Department. The Fed says its main goal when it intervenes is to &quot;smooth out&quot; choppy market conditions. It discloses its interventions only well after the fact, in quarterly reports to Congress.    But dealers at the dozen or so major banks with which the Fed trades usually know right away what is happening. Although dealers acting as agents for the Fed are expected to keep their client's identity secret, one way or another, the word often gets out.    A trader at a major New York bank says he spent much of a day recently accepting other banks' offers to sell dollars. Meanwhile, he was placing bids to buy more dollars at progressively higher prices, just as the currency teetered on the edge of a plunge.    Such a trading strategy would ordinarily be a prescription for instant losses. But the trader says he was merely following instructions from his client -- a Fed dealer on the other end of a dedicated private telephone line.    &quot;Any professional bank would recognize that I'd be losing money on those deals and that I wouldn't do that unless I was working for somebody else,&quot; the trader says. &quot;The obvious 'somebody else' is the Fed.&quot;    When the Fed wants to make a bigger splash in the market, it deals directly with a range of commercial banks. That broadcasts the central bank's intentions almost like a news release, traders say.    Traders joke that the Fed even has a low-budget strategy in which it doesn't spend a dime, except for phone calls. In this version, the central bank's traders call commercial dealers to ask for price quotes, as if the Fed were itching to buy.    &quot;They just show their hand,&quot; the chief dealer at a New York bank says. In these cases, the Fed's plan is to make nervous traders refrain from selling the dollar without actually placing any buy orders. Traders say the effectiveness of this strategy has been sharply reduced recently by overuse, however.    &quot;It's a way of showing themselves around without spending any money. It's old stuff,&quot; the chief dealer at a major bank says.    When the Fed is aggressively in the market, traders say, it places orders in increments of $10 million or more and keeps buying all day. Other central banks sometimes prefer to place one gigantic order. Thus, one dealer speculated that the Fed's intervention in dollar-yen trading one day last week was on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than for itself, because that day the Fed placed a single order at a single price and didn't follow up with more.    With the dollar at its lowest in nearly four decades against the yen despite concerted buying by many central banks, many traders consider intervention obsolete. Total currency trading can reach $250 billion a day, traders estimate, dwarfing even vigorous central bank intervention.    &quot;We're in a situation where central bank intervention is viewed as powerless,&quot; a top trader says. &quot;We need to see something besides central banks buying dollars,&quot; he says, such as policy changes that would alter market sentiment, &quot;to cause people to be a little less cocky about selling (dollars).&quot;    ---   Currency Activity   The dollar's plunge continued despite coordinated support from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and several European central banks.    The dollar fell below the levels of 140 Japanese yen and 1.80 West German marks in volatile trading. Traders were sour on the U.S. currency because of what they called a lack of cooperation among major industrial countries to correct trade imbalances and Washington's failure to close its budget deficit.    The dollar set a 39-year low of 139.10 yen in intraday trading and stood in late New York trading at 139.38, down 0.9% from 140.65 Thursday. The dollar fell 1.2% to 1.7845 marks from 1.8063.    Traders said the central banks of West Germany, Switzerland, France, Belgium and the Netherlands intervened in Europe to support the dollar against the yen.    The amount of intervention wasn't known, but Tokyo traders estimated that the Bank of Japan bought $600 million.    Traders also said the Bank of England sold British pounds to buy dollars, mainly to keep the pound from rising against the mark. The pound climbed 1% to $1.6595 from $1.6433, but it fell to 2.96 marks from 2.97.    The Bank of Canada intervened to stabilize its currency against the U.S. dollar on fears that Japanese investors will continue to take profits on Canadian investments. The Canadian dollar fell to 74.74 U.S. cents from 74.93.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $2.50 an ounce to $462.90 in heavy trading estimated at eight million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $467.70 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Friday, April 24, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
