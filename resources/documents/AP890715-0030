Jiang, at a meeting Friday on higher education also attended byPremier Li Peng, said educators must take a clear stand against``bourgeois liberalization'' in the wake of the student-led movementfor democratic reform.   Meanwhile, staff at the Jianguo Hotel and several otherwell-known Beijing hotels said officials from the China NationalPublications Import and Export Corp., a state company, on Fridayremoved all foreign magazines and newspapers from their stands.   Several other hotels, including the Sheraton Great Wall, theHoliday Inn and the Palace, also said foreign periodicals had beenconfiscated. The hotels said the Chinese officials gave no reasonfor confiscating the publications.   Hotels are among the few places Chinese have access to foreignnews accounts of the crackdown on dissent in China, which havediffered greatly with the government's version. Satellite receptionof TV news from the United States, including CNN, were cut off atseveral hotels earlier this month.   On Friday, the official press reported the government wasplanning a sweep on the nation's bookstores to removal publicationswritten by scholars wanted by police for participating in thepro-democracy movement.   The military crushed the movement in an attack on Beijing on June3-4 after the government declared it had become a``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' against the socialist system.   Jiang, the party's general secretary, said the rebellion backedup statements by senior leader Deng Xiaoping that China's mostserious fault in recent years was neglecting ideological education.   ``Quite a number of young people have been greatly influenced byWestern culture and ideology in recent years, yet we have slackenedcorrect ideological education among them. As a result, they are notmentally prepared to face the hardships and complexities in thesocialist construction and the reform,'' the official Xinhua NewsAgency quoted him as saying.   University students already have been told they will haveadditional mandatory classes in ideology this fall. The BeijingDaily reported this week that summer vacation programs have beenarranged for primary and middle school students to educate them inloving the Communist Party, socialism, the motherland and thePeople's Liberation Army.   It said military officers will give lectures to children on therebellion and children will visit martial law troops and thefamilies of soldiers killed by protesters resisting their advanceinto the city.   Jiang also gave backhanded praise to intellectuals, who hadexpressed support for the democratic movement.   He said they were the ``gem of the nation'' but that``intellectuals have their shortcomings and we should help them tohave a better understanding through education and studies.''   He said dissident Fang Lizhi, who has sought refuge in the U.S.Embassy and is wanted for purported counterrevolutionary crimes,``and his like are scum of the Chinese intellectuals and very few innumber.''   Jiang was appointed party chief on June 24 when the party purgedZhao Ziyang, who had sympathized with some of the students' demands.Zhao, stripped of all his party posts, has not been seen since May19.   Li Ruihuan, a member of the powerful Politburo StandingCommittee, noted that China's two latest bouts of bourgeoisliberalization, or flirtation with Western culture, began withstudent demonstrations. The government also launched a campaignagainst bourgeois liberalization after student demonstrations in thewinter of 1986-87.   ``This fact poses a problem for us and we should make a thoroughstudy on how to run the schools well,'' he said.   Also Friday, the U.S. Senate voted 81-10 to impose economicsanctions on China and to urge President Bush to take even harshermeasures.   The legislation, passed as an amendment to a pending StateDepartment appropriations bill, adopts several sanctions passedearlier by the House. It requires Bush to suspend several tradeprograms but gives him the flexibility to stop any programsuspension.   The legislation includes six-month suspensions of trade insuranceby the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the use of U.S. fundsto support China trade.   The Senate also adopted non-binding suggestions in which theyurged Bush to take stiffer steps, including reviewing all tradeagreements between the countries.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in Paris with Bush for asummit of the seven leading industrial nations, said theadministration would consider the legislation but that thepresident's current response to the crackdown has been appropriate.</TEXT></DOC>
