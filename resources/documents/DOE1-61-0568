Only a few months later contrast agents too toxic for humanuse were being injected into cadavers, severed limbs, and animals. Thenext major developments came in the late 1970s when percutaneous translumbaraortography and cerebral angiography were described. Contrast agentswere now less toxic, and clinically useful angiography was a reality.In 1953 a technique for percutaneous vascular catheterization which formedthe basis of many catheterization techniques to follow was described.In the 1970s the development of less invasive diagnostic methods suchas computed tomography and diagnostic ultrasound decreased the indicationsfor angiography, but newer interventional techniques such as embolizationtherapy and angioplasty have taken up the slack. Angiography remainsthe most important way to demonstrate vascular diseases graphically.Specific techniques such as angioplasty and digital subtraction angiographywill be dealt with in other chapters. The authors hope to provide anoverview of major areas of angiographic utilization. The basic techniquesof arterial puncture and catheterization have been well described elsewhere.</TEXT></DOC>
