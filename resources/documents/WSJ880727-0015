After a four-year design competition, the Transportation Department awarded the contract for the Advanced Automation System to IBM's Systems Integration Division. The 12-year contract, which includes options that could extend it to 20 years, was the biggest contract ever won by IBM and the largest ever awarded by the department.    Mimi Dawson, deputy transportation secretary, said at a news conference that both finalists -- IBM and Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp. -- submitted bids that were &quot;extremely competent technically.&quot;    &quot;Both proposals,&quot; she said, &quot;could have fulfilled our needs.&quot; But she said that &quot;an important difference was cost,&quot; with IBM submitting the lower bid. She declined to disclose the Hughes bid, saying only that &quot;the government benefited by the strong competition&quot; between the two.    The contract will form the cornerstone of the Federal Aviation Administration's massive effort to upgrade the air-traffic control system, which is burdened by rising traffic and a patchwork of old, sometimes unreliable computers and software.    The Advanced Automation System will replace all air-traffic control computers and radar screens now being used. It mainly consists of 5,000 new controller workstations that feature large, multicolored displays with sophisticated capability for handling traffic, weather, flight data and planning. The stations are to be installed beginning in the spring of 1992 in Seattle, with the 5,000 stations to be completed by mid-1998. There is also an option for 2,000 more.    The new equipment ultimately will permit the operation of the nation's air-traffic control system, which currently consists of scores of facilities, to be consolidated into 23 area centers. This raises the specter of political problems as facilities around the country are closed.    Nevertheless, FAA Administrator Allan McArtor called the awarding of the contract &quot;a significant milestone&quot; for the FAA's long-term modernization effort, known as the National Airspace System Plan. The effort could use a boost; it has often been criticized as being slow and disjointed. Moreover, while the department estimates the plan's total cost at $12 billion to $16 billion, the General Accounting Office has warned it could be as much as $23 billion.    Yesterday, IBM officials said that half of the contract will go to the company's two principal &quot;team members&quot; -- Raytheon Co. and Computer Sciences Corp. -- and a dozen or so subcontractors. William Carson, who is managing the program for IBM, said the company spent $70 million to $80 million of its own funds in the design-competition phase. It also got some $230 million from the FAA for the work.    In Lexington, Mass., Raytheon Co. said it will provide console and tower display equipment for the FAA's automation system. A company spokesman said Raytheon's share of the contract will be $500 million to $600 million, depending on the exercise of options for additional consoles and related equipment.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, IBM closed yesterday at $122.625, up 25 cents. General Motors closed on the Big Board at $79.375, down 62.5 cents.    At Hughes Aircraft, the loss of the FAA bid came as a blow to officials who had predicted confidently in interviews last month that their system would be judged superior. Hughes even had set up a separate division of its ground systems group to handle the project.    &quot;We had about 250 people working on the program. We are redeploying them,&quot; said C. Blaine Shull, senior vice president and head of the ground systems group. There may be some layoffs, but they will be small compared with the group's total 12,000-person work force, he said.    While Hughes will analyze the contract to find out why it lost, Mr. Shull said, &quot;it looks to be a properly conducted procurement.&quot; Hughes spent less than $100 million of its own money in developing its FAA system prototype, and will try to recover that investment by marketing pieces of the FAA system to other countries, Mr. Shull said.    &quot;We are disappointed, but not devastated,&quot; he said.    ---   Joseph B.
