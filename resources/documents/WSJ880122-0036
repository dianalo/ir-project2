When the same plant closed for two weeks in November, idling 3,300 hourly workers, it marked the first time since 1983 that slow sales forced Chrysler to close a plant. Chrysler later put the St. Louis plant on an extended holiday shutdown that was originally scheduled to end Monday.    Chrysler said that when it reopens the St. Louis plant, it will reduce its daily production 19%. The nation's No. 3 auto maker said earlier this week that it plans to announce a permanent plant closing within 60 days. Company officials said the St. Louis car plant is one of three leading candidates for such a closing.    U.S. auto makers expect to build 126,735 cars this week, up 9.4% from last week, but still down 19% from the 156,961 cars assembled a year ago.    Domestic car production is down 24% so far this year compared with the same period in 1987.    General Motors Corp. has four idled plants this week. Its Pontiac, Mich., plant, which assembles Pontiac Fieros will be closed until Monday. GM's Hamtramck, Mich., luxury car plant, and its Oklahoma City and North Tarrytown, N.Y., midsized car plants will be down until Feb. 1 because of excess inventory. GM's GMC Truck division plans to run two Saturday overtime shifts at its Baltimore van plant.    GM also said it canceled plans to close its Buick City complex in Flint, Mich., and its Wentzville, Mo., plant for a week in late February. A spokeswoman said car orders were higher than expected. GM is still planning to close its Willow Run, Mich., plant for the week of Feb. 22.    Ford Motor Co. said it scheduled overtime for Saturday at its Kansas City, Mo., Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz plant, its Wixom, Mich., Lincoln luxury car plant and its St. Louis Aerostar minivan plant.    Honda of America Manufacturing Inc., a unit of Honda Motor Co. of Japan has scheduled an overtime shift Saturday at its Marysville, Ohio, plant, which builds Accords and Civics.    ---               This    Last   Yr.
