U.S. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, meanwhile, said Washington was addressing its budget problems and gave an upbeat talk on progress in international policy coordination to about 200 senior commercial bankers, central bankers and corporate officials attending the International Monetary Conference.    Michel Camdessus, chairman of the International Monetary Fund, said a narrower budget deficit would allow U.S. exports to expand without spurring inflation and would pave the way for &quot;lasting reductions in real interest rates.&quot;    He called for &quot;bold steps&quot; to cut the deficit at the start of next year, after the presidential elections. He said the IMF would prefer to see cuts in government spending, but if those don't suffice, &quot;then all the other avenues have to be considered,&quot; including increased taxes.    A senior Swiss banker, conceding that the U.S. had so far been able to finance its deficits in its own currency, warned that foreign investors appetites' for dollar-denominated securities &quot;could end suddenly before anyone realized it.&quot;    Mr. Camdessus called for industrial nations with trade surpluses as well as &quot;certain newly industrializing countries&quot; -- a phrase that usually refers to Taiwan and South Korea, among others -- to reduce those surpluses. He also urged industrial nations to reschedule foreign debts of the poorest countries on more lenient terms.    Haruo Mayekawa, a former governor of Japan's central bank and now chairman of Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co., a Japanese telecommunications concern, suggested that industrial nations divert funds equal to about 1% of their aggregate gross national product to developing countries. Such a sum, he said, corresponds to the industrial world's current-account surplus. The current account is trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers.    Michel Francois-Poncet, chairman of Cie. Financiere de Paribas, the holding company for one of France's major banks, said debtor developing nations &quot;now finance the rich countries to the tune of some $10 billion&quot; a year. He said global capital flows that once primarily went from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere &quot;now flow within the golden triangle of London, New York and Tokyo.&quot;    Secretary Baker called for cautious but steady improvement in economic policy coordination among major industrial nations and praised efforts that have been made so far along those lines.    In a speech similar to one he delivered last month in Paris, Mr. Baker implicitly rejected proposals to move toward a fixed exchange-rate system similar to the one set up after World War II.    &quot;An attempt to make an abrupt or major change in the structure of the system by imposing a detailed set of formal constraints might well be viewed by the markets as overly ambitious and unsustainable,&quot; he said.    He said such an approach might not &quot;give adequate regard to political realities or the force of financial flows.&quot;    The Treasury secretary said the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and Britain have made considerable progress in coordinating economic policies since the Plaza agreement of 1985, when they agreed to cooperate in bringing down the value of the dollar.    &quot;As a result,&quot; he said, &quot;the world economy is on a much more solid footing. Growth continues, but it is now more balanced,&quot; with inflation remaining low. He also said the U.S. has taken steps to reduce its budget deficit while Japan and West Germany have moved to stimulate domestic demand and &quot;reduce reliance on export-led growth.&quot;    In a passage that drew applause from several in the audience, Mr. Baker defended his approach to the Third World debt problem as the only proposal that promises economic growth without using taxpayer funds to bail out debtor nations. His program calls for continued commercial bank and international agency lending combined with structural changes in debtor country economies. </TEXT></DOC>
