About 2,000 people in the Slovak capital of Bratislava gatheredFriday night in front of the National Theater for a candlelightrally banned by Communist authorities, who tightly controlreligious activities.   Witnesses said authorities broke up the demonstration by pushinginto side streets protesters who had been singing Slovak and Czechnational anthems, praying and holding candles.   Hundreds of people were arrested and many were beaten by police,including some journalists, reporters said.   There is growing discontent among Catholics at authorities'refusal to agree to Vatican candidates to fill 10 vacantbishoprics. No new Czechoslovak bishops have been named since 1973and the three alive are all over 75.   Jan Cernogursky, who helped organize the rally, said in atelephone interview from Bratislava that if there were similarprotests in future, ``then the government will no longer be able tofreely decide over the heads of the citizens.''   ``It was a new form of civil protest in this country after 40years, because a previously announced demonstration of citizens ... has practically never taken place here before,'' he told Austrianradio.   The massive police turnout and violent action to disperse thecrowd appeared designed to discourage opposition by Catholics,430,000 of whom are said to have so far signed a petition forreligious freedom and the appointment of bishops and priests.   Otto Hoermann of Austrian state television ORF said his crew wasdragged away by policemen, who appeared drunk, and taken to policeheadquarters for 2{ hours. Two other ORF journalists were held foreight hours. A team of the West German ARD TV network also wasdetained.   Hoermann said he saw scores of people, drenched by water cannon,lined up at police headquarters with their faces to the wall. Theexact number of arrests could not be determined.   Bratislava is near the Austrian border, 40 miles east of Vienna.   Negotiations between the government and a Vatican delegation inPrague in January were inconclusive, largely because the Holy Seerefused to agree to candidates belonging to the pro-governmentPacem in Terris organization of clergymen, which is banned by theVatican.   The talks are scheduled to resume in Rome next month.   The 31-point petition being signed by hundreds of thousands ofCatholics nationwide _ an unprecedented manifestation ofCatholicism in the Soviet bloc _ has made authorities increasinglynervous.   It calls for more bishops, more priests and separation of churchand state as well as the right to question Marxist dogma and topetition authorities without harassment.   The petition's author, Augustin Navratil, was arrested earlierthis month and charged with committing ``slander of a state organand of a public organization,'' which carries a term of up to oneyear imprisonment.   Frantisek Miklosko, a Slovak Catholic activist, had announcedthe rally to authorities ``on behalf of several faithful fellowcitizens'' and organizers expected up to 70,000 participants.   But authorities on Thursday issued a ban, saying the planneddemonstration was ``an event guided from abroad'' that was directedagainst the socialist system.</TEXT></DOC>
