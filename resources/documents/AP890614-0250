You did it in five minutes, then you went and sat downuntil somebody told you to do something else.''   Even though he worked on equipment, Daugherty was forbidden toinstall electrical tubing. That was reserved for another craft.   What was standard operating procedure for a United Steelworkersmember in the early 1980s is now history for those, like Daugherty,out on the cutting edge of labor-management relations.   In the emerging knowledge economy, people like Daugherty arevalued as much for their grasp of the big picture as for their gripon a Phillips screwdriver.   The 37-year-old L-S Electrogalvanizing Co. employee roams theplant now repairing anything electrical. He is encouraged to learnother crafts. The company pays his tuition for technical courses,and as his skills improve, so does his pay.   Daugherty can make a dollar per hour above the average industrywage to around $13 per hour, or around $27,000 per year. Productionbonuses and overtime can push the annual figure to around $40,000.   Nobody hides from the bosses anymore. Workers step forward withideas to improve operations at the sheet steel coating plant, a60-40 joint venture of LTV Corp. and Sumitomo Metal Industries ofJapan. In fact, employees are paid to meet regularly with theirmanagers.   ``If we don't work with our employees to make them happier andget more work out of them, we're all doomed,'' said LTV Steel Co.President David Hoag. ``How can you talk about internationalcompetitiveness when people hate their jobs?''   Companies such as L-S Electrogalvanizing are actually ahead ofthe vaunted Japanese in labor relations, Hoag argues.   Japanese steel companies haven't advanced beyond the qualitycircle, an early form of participative management that employeeshere dismiss as a glorified suggestion box.   Sumitomo officials had to be coaxed to accept the partnershipprogram, Hoag said.   ``The Japanese are more autocratic than the Americans ever were.They have a lot of ways of eliciting suggestions, but ... in the endthe talk doesn't mean a thing,'' he said.   The 65 employees of L-S Electrogalvanizing, who produce top-gradegalvanized sheet for auto body panels, are pioneers in a 4-year-oldventure in industrial democracy. Dawn is breaking on a realm longshaded by arrogance, mistrust and retribution.   ``Everybody knows what's going on. Everybody pulls together,''said John Gresh, 30, who joined the company two years ago.   Where the United States once monopolized the world's steelmakingknow-how, just about anybody can make steel these days, and justabout everybody is.   What's harder to come by is smart steel, the kind L-SElectrogalvanizing produces. It's made on computer-controlled millsin less time by fewer people. It's freer of defects, more precise incomposition and monotonously true in its dimensions.   Smart steel is shaping up as the American steel industry's ticketinto the 21st century. U.S. producers are getting smart with bettertechnology _ new furnaces, continuous casters and rolling mills thatrepresent the best thinking in metallurgy.   With innovations as simple as changing the way workers and bossestalk to one another, companies are tapping a long-sealed repositoryof profitable information, the rank-and-file employee.   At L-S Electrogalvanizing, a lone process coordinator is oftenthe only manager on hand, and that person helps the 12 others onduty to operate the highly automated line.   Parking spaces are first-come, first-served. Locker rooms aresegregated only by sex. There is one dining room, no time clock andeveryone has a key to the tool room.   ``It's like being among your friends at school. Not one of usminds doing clean-up because we pride ourselves on our mill,'' Greshsaid.   Management handed the workers a study estimating the price of achemical engineering project at $90,000, and the workers did it for$5,000, said operations manager Mike Mueller. ``Our people justrecognize a problem and take it on.''   Joint union-management committees can change anything except thefinancial terms of the contract, including training requirements fornew workers and production goals, which bear on bonuses.   Although decisions are made by consensus, there has never been animpasse.   Work rules are few and simple: ``Be there. Be there on time, anddo what you have to do'' to complete your assignment, said Mueller.   ``Now we wrap coils like it's Christmastime,'' said Wes Humphrey,the vice president of Steelworkers Local 9126.   Overall, the workers so respect management that union officialsproposed that the union's superior production bonus plan be extendedto cover process coordinators, the equivalent of front-line foremen.   ``They work just like us. They eat dirt with us. They should getthe gravy with us,'' Humphrey said.   Participative management emerged in the 1980 contract talks andits popularity grew as the industry lost $12 billion from 1982 to1986 amid plant closings and the elimintion of more than 100,000jobs.   LTV Corp. remains under court protection from creditors underChapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.   ``I've seen so much heartache and suffering. It was toodisheartening to just look at and not try to do something aboutit,'' said Frank Valenta, a union director.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday June 25</NOTE></DOC>
