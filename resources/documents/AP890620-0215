The raw speed of computers is tricky to compare because theperformance of a machine depends on its software and the work it isgiven. But NCube helped its credibility by announcing Monday its newcomputer, NCube 2, would run Unix System V, a widely used type ofbase-layer software.   NCube, a privately owned company based in Beaverton, Ore., alsoannounced its new machine will run Oracle Corp.'s data-basemanagement software, which is used by businesses for storing andretrieving electronic records.   The ability to run Oracle could help set NCube apart from itsrivals, said Michael Burwen, president of Palo Alto Management Group.   ``Ordinarily the architecture of a supercomputer is pointed todoing number-crunching kinds of things, rather than the kinds ofthings you need to do for data-base retrieval,'' Burwen said.   He said other supercomputer makers, including Cray Research Inc.,are working with Oracle on versions of its data-base softwarecapable of running on their machines.   ``It's probably going to be important to NCube. They're one ofthese companies that's had a solution looking for a market,'' Burwensaid.   NCube said first shipments were scheduled for July. Prices willstart at $495,000.   The company was founded in 1983 and shipped its first computer in1985.</TEXT></DOC>
