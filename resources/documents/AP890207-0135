The chairman, Swedish meteorology professor Bert Bolin, called ongovernments for early action to prevent a crisis.   The study will gather data on climate change and its possibleeffects and will suggest remedies, Bolin said after a two-daymeeting of the group.   Cutting down on the use of fossil fuels is likely to be a mainrecommendation in the study, to be presented to the U.N. GeneralAssembly in 1990, he said.   Carbon dioxide builds up by burning of fossil fuels like oil,coal and gas, but also through widespread cutting down of trees.Chlorofluorocarbons, known mainly as spray propellants, also remaina factor despite global measures to cut their use, Bolin said.   The gases are believed to create atmospheric changes that slowthe escape of heat from Earth in a phenomenon known as the``Greenhouse Effect.''   Scientists fear global warming could ultimately lead to morefrequent extreme weather like frosts and heat waves, and changes inthe sea level and weather patterns.   The group, featuring experts from 30 nations, was set up inNovember by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.N.Environment Program.</TEXT></DOC>
