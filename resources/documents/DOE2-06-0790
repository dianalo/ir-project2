Checking and eliminationof deviations of actual from reference values are prerequisites for productionoperation to continue; hence computer assistance will enhance the plant'savailability in an effective way. Enhanced quality of signal evaluationdue to computer support allows optimum detection and elimination of disturbedfunctions even within recurrent/in-service inspections. This will allowto ensure the quality of 'monitoring and reliability testing' throughoutoperation.</TEXT></DOC>
