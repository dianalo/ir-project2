The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 562.39 points, or 1.77percent, closing at 31,263.57. The Nikkei fell 14.53 points onTuesday.   The dollar closed at 158.63 yen, up 1.67 yen from Tuesday'sclose of 156.96 yen. It opened at 158.30 yen and ranged between158.15 yen and 158.85 yen. The dollar now has gained 6.43 yen innine trading days.   The dollar last traded at the 158-yen level in January 1987.   ``The dollar has been so strong, and its rising pace is veryfast,'' said Shinichi Kato, a trader with Mitsui Bank.   The dollar's advance followed its overnight rise in New York.   Kato said a large demand for the dollar prior to year-endaccount settlements is pushing the U.S. currency higher. Japan'sfiscal year ends on Saturday.   Importers, many of whom are afraid that the dollar will risefurther, jump at the dollar whenever it moves downward, he said.   Kato blamed the lack of coordinated market intervention amongcentral banks for the dollar's swift ascent.   ``The Bank of Japan alone can no longer control the situation,''he said. ``The dollar's upward momentum has become too strong now.''   Japan's central bank was seen intervening in the market byselling some $300 million. The bank does not officially comment onits market intervention.   Because the U.S. Federal Reserve did not sell dollars during theprevious day, Japanese market players began to speculate that theUnited States approves of the current dollar-yen rate, he added.   ``The dollar will soon hit the 160-yen level. It's just a matterof time,'' Kato said.   The yen's decline knocked the Nikkei index more than 650 pointslower in early trading, but the Nikkei made up some of its lossesas market players picked up shipbuilding issues whose prices hadfallen earlier, dealers said.   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said after a Cabinetmeeting Wednesday that he is watching current exchange rate levelswith great concern, Kyodo News Service reported.   It quoted Hashimoto as saying he had received an invitation toattend the meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers in Parisin April, but that he would decide whether to attend the meeting onthe basis of the conditions at the time in the Japanese Parliament.</TEXT></DOC>
