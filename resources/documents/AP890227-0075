The justices said they will review the bank robbery convictionand 70-year prison sentence of Reuben Dowling.   Federal prosecutors said Dowling used a ski mask and a pistol torob $7,000 from the First Pennsylvania Bank in Frederiksted, St.Croix, on July 8, 1985.   At his trial, prosecutors introduced evidence of Dowling'salleged robbery of a private home weeks after the bank robberyoccurred. Dowling previously had been tried and acquitted of chargesstemming from the residential robbery.   A federal trial judge allowed prosecutors to introduce suchevidence, and the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that ruling.   The appeals court said the evidence should not have been admittedbut its use was ``harmless'' _ meaning that Dowling would have beenconvicted even if it had not been used.   In the appeal acted on today, Dowling argued that telling jurorsabout a crime for which he was acquitted violated his constitutionalrights and should not have been ruled harmless error.   Justice Department lawyers argued that the evidence should nothave been ruled inadmissible. They said that although six federalappeals courts have barred such evidence, three federal appealscourts have allowed it.   The case is Dowling vs. U.S., 88-6025.</TEXT></DOC>
