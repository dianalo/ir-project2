The dollar's rally has produced mixed results at thesefunds, which invest in U.S. and foreign corporate andgovernment bonds maturing in three years or less. A few fundseven had small losses in March. For investors, it's a sternreminder that while these funds may turn out to be goodlong-term performers, they are not, and never were, as safeas money-market funds.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'm sure many of the shareholders are shocked that theycould lose money,&quot; says Kurt Brouwer, president of Brouwer andamp;Janachowski, a San Francisco investment adviser. In somecases, &quot;people selling these things were positioning themnext to certificates of deposit.&quot;   What went wrong? Well, the funds, which now yield around9%, were supposed to guard against currency fluctuations byusing sophisticated currency hedging techniques. But duringthe recent surge in the dollar, some funds suffered becausethey weren't hedged enough.   &quot;March was the trial by fire,&quot; says Mark Turner, managerof Scudder Short-Term Global Income Fund, a no-load fundlaunched in early March. &quot;Most of these funds came throughunscathed.&quot;   Most, but not all. A few funds finished the month withslight losses. Equitable Short-Term World Income Fund Class Awas off 2.75% in March, while the Shearson Short-Term WorldIncome Fund was down 1.32%.   Portfolio managers involved with the Equitable andShearson funds concede that their funds were hurt duringMarch because they hadn't fully hedged away the risk posed bya rising dollar.   &quot;We were slightly underhedged, which meant we came down alittle bit,&quot; says Alan Brown, who manages three Shearsonshort-term global bond funds. &quot;The movement {by the fund} hasbeen very modest compared with the movement of the dollaragainst the {German} mark.&quot; Equitable says its fund sufferedpartly because it was underhedged and partly because thefund's assets grew rapidly during the month.   During March, the German mark fell almost 11% against thedollar. Meanwhile the Shearson fund barely slipped 1%. &quot;Theseare the kind of ripples you have to expect with these sortsof funds,&quot; says Mr. Brown.   But for some investors, even a 1% drop is likely to comeas a surprise, because they thought of these funds as analternative to money-market funds and certificates ofdeposit.   With a certificate of deposit or a moneymarket fund, theinvestor is virtually assured of not losing any of theoriginal investment. But that isn't the case with a globalshort-term bond fund, where the share price fluctuates alongwith securities held in the portfolio.   Global short-term bond funds have proved hugely popular,attracting more than $10 billion from investors in less thantwo years. The first two funds, offered by Alliance CapitalManagement Corp., came out in May 1989 and February 1990.Since then, at least 18 copycat funds have been launched.Virtually all of these funds charge some sort of salescommission.   Why have these funds sold so well? Put it down to acombination of lavish yield and low share-price volatility.According to Lipper Analytical Services, the AllianceShort-Term Multi-Market Trust Class A Shares -- one of thetwo original funds -- returned 12.2% over the last 12 months.That compares with 7.5% for the average money market fund and10.1% for the average taxable bond fund.   A key ingredient in Alliance's success has been theability of its funds to exploit the European MonetarySystem's exchange rate mechanism. The ERM ties 10 Europeancurrencies together so that these currencies can onlyfluctuate in relatively narrow bands compared with oneanother.   Imagine a fund buys United Kingdom bonds, which arerelatively high yielding. Because of that high yield, it'sexpensive for the fund to hedge away its exposure tofluctuations in the pound-dollar exchange rate.   So instead, the fund hedges away the currency risk betweenthe German mark and the dollar, which is a cheaper hedge tobuy because German interest rates are relatively low. As aresult of the German mark-dollar hedge, the fund eliminatesmuch of its exposure to fluctuations in the pound. Why?Because the German mark and the U.K. pound are tied togetherthrough the ERM.   But a global bond fund's share price will still movearound, partly because the currencies within the ERMfluctuate versus one another and partly because these fundsown foreign bonds from countries outside of the ERM. Inaddition, the hedging can go awry, as clearly happened withsome funds during March.   But even with all these potential problems, globalshort-term bond funds have generally produced good results.And, argue fund managers, they should continue to producedecent returns.   Global short-term bond funds &quot;represent a very low-riskway of picking up additional yield,&quot; says Shearson's Mr.Brown. &quot;The point that needs to be made to investors is thatthese are not a money market fund.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
