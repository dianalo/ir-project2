Grace andamp; Co. said it terminated its previously reported agreement to sell its 82% interest in Taco Villa Inc. to an affiliate of Del Taco International Inc.    Grace said closely held Del Taco was unable to secure financing for the transaction, which was valued at $34 million, by the end of 1986, the time period specified in the agreement. It said the two companies were reviewing &quot;a number of other possible transactions.&quot; Grace, a chemical and natural resources concern, declined to elaborate on what those might be.    In Costa Mesa, Calif., officials of Del Taco, which operates a fast-food restaurant chain, couldn't be reached for comment.    Grace said the termination of this transaction won't affect the previously announced leveraged buyout of Grace's restaurant group, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
