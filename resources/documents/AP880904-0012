An Air Force aircraft was unable to identify any center ofcirculation with the depression and all warnings along the Gulfcoast were discontinued.   Meantime, a depression in the Atlantic some 800 miles northeastof Bermuda became Tropical Storm Ernesto, according to a 6 p.m. EDTadvisory issued by the National Hurricane Center. The storm wasmoving north-northeast.   Tropical storm warnings issued at 5 p.m. CDT Saturday fromCameron, La., to Apalachicola were discontinued by late evening,according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center.   The Atlantic storm was moving at 30 mph, and mainly posed aconcern at sea, hurricane specialist Bob Case said. Gradualstrengthening was expected over the next 24 hours.   ``It appears it is going to get some help with the colder airtemperatures north of it ... and just become a big storm in theAtlantic,'' he said.   Depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their maximumsustained winds reach 39 mph. Hurricanes pack winds of at least 74mph.
