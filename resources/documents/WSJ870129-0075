The agency said the delay is needed to complete an extensive study of three potential sites, to meet Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing requirements that haven't been completed, and to consult further with states and Indian tribes.    The announcement came on the eve of testimony today by Energy Secretary John Herrington before the Senate Energy Committee. The hearing is expected to kick off a major new debate on how to carry out the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which has aroused bitter political opposition in regions targeted as potential waste sites.    Even the announcement of the delay wasn't without controversy. Ben Rusche, head of the agency's civilian radioactive waste-management office, told a congressional briefing yesterday that he planned to make the change with or without new legislation. But Rep. Ron Weiden (D., Ore.) insisted that the agency lacks authority to make the change without obtaining an amendment to the 1982 act. The act calls for nuclear waste deliveries to the repository by 1998.    The deferral enhances the importance of the agency's monitored retrievable storage facility, which is intended to hold high-level radioactive waste temporarily. The agency has planned to build that facility in Oak Ridge, Tenn., but is barred by court order from presenting such a plan to Congress.    The department, presenting a new draft of its waste-managment &quot;mission plan,&quot; also gave its most extensive explanation for its deferral of the search for a second permanent repository site in the eastern U.S.    The agency said its projections show that the first repository won't be completely filled before 2020. For that reason, it said, Congress doesn't need to consider a proposal for a second repository until the mid-1990s or later.    Officials in Texas, Nevada and Washington, where potential sites for permanent waste repositories have been identified, are battling in courts and Congress to block the department from selecting their states. Some members of Congress say the waste-disposal law may have to be revised.    Mr. Rusche, in a recent interview, said some financial incentive may be needed to encourage acceptance of the facilities. But he said that he and Secretary Herrington plan to proceed with selecting and building a site. &quot;We think the act as it is written is appropriate and doesn't need to be changed,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
