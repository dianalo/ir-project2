When neutrons interactwith the detector, visible bubbles immediately appear which are immobilizedby the medium to give a lasting image. Experiments showed that thesedetectors were insensitive to gamma radiation, but were very sensitiveto Pu-Be neutrons - allowing for the measurement of less than 1 mremof fast neutrons. Work has been done in connection with the developmentof a personal neutron dosimeter for radiation protection purposes. Thesestudies include the effect of different types of detector liquids, thebehaviour of detectors with storage, the effect of time (during use)on detection sensitivity and on bubbles formed by neutron irradiation,the influence of ambient temperature on detector response and the effectof the volume of dispersed detector liquid on absolute detection efficiency.Studies have also been made on the neutron energy response of such detectorshaving different types of detector liquids. It was found that the lowenergy threshold of bubble detectors is determined by a particular propertyof detector liquids, so that detectors of desired thresholds can be produced.One type of detector, can detect fast neutrons to below 50 keV and canalso detect thermal neutrons. When worn on the body, this detector providesan essentially flat dose equivalent response from thermal to 20 MeV.</TEXT></DOC>
