Hungary, along with Poland, is in the front rank of reform in theSoviet bloc, eclipsing Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's moremodest campaigns.   Where the Soviets have adjusted their Communist-dominated systemto introduce a measure of democracy and personal freedom, Hungary'sCommunist leadership has pledged to allow free elections by nextJune that could end the party's 43-year-old hold on power.   Poland this week installed the East bloc's first government notled by Communists.   Where the Soviets favor reducing central control of industries,sentiment in Hungary has swung to scrapping all state interferencein the economy in favor of market forces.   This week, Hungary enraged Communist hard-liner East Germany byallowing thousands of East Germans to cross its border to the West.   Hungarian officials have been candid about the risks of thecountry's shift.   ``There is a danger of Hungary becoming isolated in EasternEurope as some of the things Hungary is doing irritate our neighborsand allies,'' Foreign Minister Gyula Horn told Hungarian radio Aug.29. ``Altering our approach, however, would mean curtailing ourfreedom of action.''   An unprecedented plan announced Sept. 8 to cooperate with neutralAustria and non-aligned Yugoslavia in setting up demilitarized zonesalong common borders is perhaps the clearest sign of a cautious moveaway from the Warsaw Pact.   Hungary's aspirations extend even farther westward, with leadersknocking on the doors of the 12-nation European Economic Community,the world's largest trading bloc.   Hungary already has privileges with the EEC unique within theSoviet bloc. It signed a 10-year agreement with the EEC in June 1988granting it reduced tariffs on its exports to EEC nations. Theaccord is the most liberal the EEC has signed with a Soviet bloccountry.   Hungarian leaders used the recent East German refugee standoff topress their case with West Germany for a political voice in the bloc.   West Germany did not go public with a promise to support thosewishes. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl subsequently said his countrywill give full backing to Hungary's economic reforms, andexpectations are that West German gratitude over the East Germanexodus will translate into generous financial aid.   President Bush praised Hungarian reforms during a July visit, andCongress last week voted to extend by three years instead of thecustomary one year Hungary's Most Favored Nation trading status,which offers the best tariff rates.   Hungary's leaders say they have Soviet blessings for theincreasing independence that is moving them closer to the West, butthe reforms are breaking Budapest away from some other traditionalallies.   Relations are worst with Romania because of disputes over thefate of 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania. Hungary says theyare being systematically persecuted, an accusation Romania denies.   Tensions exploded after Hungary broke an agreement two years agothat had committed it to return those fleeing Romania's Stalinistsystem. Since then, more than 20,000 Romanians, mostly ethnicHungarians, have found sanctuary in Hungary.   Relations hit bottom in July after Horn, Hungary's foreignminister, expressed anxiety that the war of words could escalate toviolence.   Horn, referring to Romania's boast in April that it could buildnuclear missiles, expressed fears Hungary could be a target of suchweapons one day.   The Defense Ministry gave up all pretense of ``fraternal'' tieswith the Romanian military Sept. 7, announcing that Romania's deputydefense minister would not visit as planned.   Tensions of a different kind have been building on Hungary'snorthern border with Czechoslovakia.   Because of budgetary and environmental pressures, Hungaryabruptly stopped work in May on a joint Danube River dam projectagreed to in 1977. This enraged Czechoslovak partners.   The Czechoslovaks accused Hungary of breaking their word. TheHungarians said the Czechosklovaks were planning to ``violateinternational law'' by unilaterally diverting a river that formspart of the countries' common boundary.   Growing bitterness over the dam project has been exacerbated bypolitical differences.   Hungary's leaders used the Aug 21 anniversary of the 1968 WarsawPact invasion of Czechoslovakia to denounce the move, which crusheda Czechoslovak reform movement. Polish leaders also criticized theinvasion.   East Germany is the latest to join the chorus of East Europeancritics of the reform-minded Hungarians, its ire raised byBudapest's decision to open a westward escape route for thousands ofEast Germans.   State-controlled East German media accused Hungary of beingbought by the West Germans, and the East Berlin Foreign Ministryfiled a formal protest over the action.   The Soviet reaction to change in Hungary has ranged from praiseto tolerance. Gorbachev has pointed to Hungarian economic reforms asexamples to inspire Soviet workers, and Hungarian electoral reformsare reported broadly in state-run Soviet media.   But Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov indicatedKremlin reservations about the refugee exodus, describing it as``unusual.''</TEXT></DOC>
