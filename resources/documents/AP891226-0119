Ceausescu, gaunt and looking his 71 years, repeatedly told thecourt he would answer only to the country's rubber-stamp parliament``and the working-class'' for his actions.   His wife, restrained from speaking several times when herhusband put his hand on her arm or leg, blasted back at unseenprosecutors accusing the family of stashing cash in Swiss banks.   ``Prove it,'' she retorted. ``This is a base provocation.''   Ceausescu alternately remained silent after questions about his24 years of dictatorial policy, or shouted replies in the raisedvoice he used in his most strident speeches.   ``Everything that was said here was false, and I don't want totalk any more,'' he said.   ``This was a coup d'etat and I don't answer your questions,'' heproclaimed at another point.   The couple sat silently as the indictment was read, chargingthem with genocide of more than 60,000 people, the undermining ofthe state and the economy, the destruction of historic monumentsand attempting to flee by hiding more than $1 billion in foreignbanks.   Ceausescu refused to answer key questions about who ordered theDec. 17 shooting of unarmed civilians in the western city ofTimisoara that precipated the popular rage that drove him frompower.   Elena Ceausescu, who was effectively in charge of Romania Dec.18-20 while her husband was in Iran, acted unconcerned when askedif she knew of the shooting in Timsisoara.   ``What are you talking about?'' she demanded.   ``Who ordered the shooting in Bucharest?'' a voice asked,referring to the shooting of protesters in Bucharest last Thursday,a day before the army backed the revolt and the Ceausescus wereforced to flee.   ``Nobody was shot in the Palace Square,'' Ceausescu said. He wasreferring to the square where he addressed a pro-government rallyThursday that backfired and turned into a demonstration against him.   The Ceausescus were captured Saturday in an underground bunkerat an undisclosed location. They were tried, sentenced and shot todeath by firing squad on Monday.   Earlier Tuesday, the television broadcast scenes of theirbullet-ridden bodies slumped against a wall. A close-up showedCeausescu's face, his eyes open and blood on the right side.   It has not been disclosed where and exactly when they were triedand shot after the secret trial.   ``Do you know what's happening now? Why are these peoplefighting in the street?'' the prosecutor demanded, referring tostreet battles between security troops loyal to Ceausescu and thearmy, which backs the revolutionaries.   ``The people are fighting the gangs of traitors who in collusionwith foreign forces organized this coup d'etat,'' Ceausescuanswered.   ``Do you know that you were sacked as a president and a supremecommander of the army?'' the prosecutor asked.   ``No, I do not recognize this. I am the President of theSocialist Republic of Romania,'' Ceausescu replied.   Asked why he exported food grown in the country and left his ownpeople scraping by on meager rations, Ceausescu characteristicallycited the inflated statistics he loved to use to justify hisStalinist policies.   ``It's a lie that the people are hungry,'' he said.   ``Why were the peasants going to Bucharest to buy bread?''retorted the prosecutor. Ceausescu was silent.   At another point in the 40-minute broadcast, he defended hishated plan to ``systemize'' the countryside by moving peasants fromvillages to shoddy new housing in agro-industrial centers. Heclaimed the plan would bring more civilization to Romania'stradition-rich peasantry.   ``I didn't want to destroy the villages, on the contrary it wasa buildup of villages, they were supposed to get doctors,schools,'' he said.   ``It was an improvement, not a destruction. They were to be thebest villages in the world.''   The couple also was asked about the luxurious lifestyle of theirdaughter Zoia-Elena, captured by soldiers on Sunday.   Television has shown footage of her opulent villa, containingjewels and other artifacts from national museums and her twolapdogs, said to have been fed with imported meat weighed on goldenscales.   ``We don't have any villa,'' Ceausescu defiantly replied. Bothhe and his wife laughed when asked about the imported meat for pets.   ``We lived like normal citizens. It's incredible what you areaccusing us of,'' Ceausescu said.   ``Did you ever suffer from any mental disorder?'' Elena wasasked at one point.   ``Oh, what a base provocation,'' answered the woman who only aweek ago reigned supreme in Romania.</TEXT></DOC>
