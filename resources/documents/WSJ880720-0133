A smile of pride crossed his weathered face as his eyes and hands swept along the smooth features of the weapon.    From across the room the rifle didn't look that different from the hundreds of thousands that rest in gun shops and gun cases across America, but it was a masterpiece of rippling dark chestnut and blue-gray metal.    &quot;Don't just look at it, work it,&quot; said Mr. Miller. The bolt and trigger flowed silently and smoothly as a river down its banks. Shouldered, the gun held its aim in an uncanny balance that made the unwavering sight feel like an extension of the human eye.    Mr. Miller's custom creations are without a doubt some of the finest firearms in the world. They're also some of the most expensive. Off-the-rack rifles costing a fraction of a Miller custom creation satisfy most people. But then again, Mr. Miller isn't building his rifles for most people.    &quot;There are people out there in the world who are always looking for something better, especially if it's something that's important to them,&quot; said Mr. Miller. &quot;Those who love cars go for a Rolls, and those who love firearms and hunting can go for a gun such as ours. A lot of it is simple pride in ownership, knowing that they have the best.&quot;    And according to Mr. Miller, &quot;the best&quot; can never come from a high-speed factory. &quot;In a way you can compare fine firearms with fine furniture,&quot; he said. &quot;The machine hasn't been made yet that can replace what can be done by the combination of the human hand and a lot of time. Sometimes the differences between factory and custom may not appear that great, but when you consider what it takes to make that separation it's incredible.&quot;    Incredible may be the best word to describe the time and precision that go into one of Mr. Miller's guns. He and a pair of associates bring forth a mere 10 rifles a year.    Each craftsman pursues his own specialty. One may spend weeks pulling a stock from a slab of French walnut that was chosen from thousands of others. Another man spends day after day tooling the metal parts to almost microscopic detail.    And, not surprisingly, the price reflects the intenseness of their labor. Mr. Miller reports that most of his works go for close to $20,000. His masterpiece, a rifle that was designed and built as one of a set of five for Safari Club International, brought $201,000 at auction in 1986.    With the exception of such special-edition productions, Mr. Miller is quick to point out that most of his works serve a dual purpose. &quot;We're working with what we consider a functional art,&quot; said Mr. Miller. &quot;That is, our firearms not only have to look among the best, they also must function, or operate, as the very best. Many of my clients are people who may hunt six months of the year under all kinds of conditions all over the world. Our guns must be able to stand that kind of treatment.&quot;    There are, however, some guns that are made for the specific purpose of being pampered. In the quaint Missouri town of St. Joseph, a small number of craftsmen at the Hatfield Rifle Works labor to put out what are unquestionably some of the finest muzzle-loading rifles and side-by-side shotguns made in the U.S.    All are hand-tooled creations from beautifully grained curly maple and fine steel. Even their &quot;bottom-of-the-line&quot; model has the look of custom quality. From there things only get better.    Finer models bear intricate engraved scrollwork, some inlaid with 24-carat gold depicting classic game or dogs. Others are more personal. &quot;Some sportsmen may simply have their initials added to our standard engraving pattern,&quot; said Ted Hatfield, owner of the company. &quot;Others want the entire piece done individually for them. We just finished one for a gentleman who wanted his family's hunting camp in Maine engraved on one side and their island off Honduras on the other -- complete with palm trees.&quot;    There also are thousands of sportsmen who take the custom option because they can't use mass-produced guns. While most factory guns are created equal, most gunners aren't.    &quot;Most firearms are made to fit the average shooter, about 5 foot 10 inches tall and 165 pounds, but obviously not everyone is that size,&quot; said Michael Murphy, a firearms dealer near Augusta, Kan. Mr. Murphy explained that an improper gun fit causes the shooter to shape his body to fit the gun rather than the other way around. &quot;With a proper fit,&quot; he continued, &quot;a gun basically becomes an extension of the shooter's body. It usually makes the difference between really doing well and just getting by.&quot;    Getting properly fitted for a gun often involves much trial and error. Mr. Murphy shortcuts the process with his &quot;try gun,&quot; an ancient English side-by-side that feels slightly awkward and stock-heavy to the touch because of its many adjustable joints and extensions. The only thing the try gun can't adjust is the price of the custom guns it measures for. But in the rarefied world of the custom rifle, price is not the main point.    &quot;Several of my customers are very frugal,&quot; said Mr. Murphy. &quot;That is, until it comes to their shotgun and then they'll pay whatever it takes to get what they want. . . . In a way a custom gun is an expression of what and who they are.&quot;    ---   Mr. Pearce is a free-lance writer in Manhattan, Kan. </TEXT></DOC>
