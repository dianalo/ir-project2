On admission to our hospital, adenine arabinoside was administeredupon the diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis, but it had no apparenteffect. The patient showed moderate leukocytosis, but no other abnormallaboratory data. Serological examinations for virus titer were all negative.A CT scan on the 9th day showed a diffuse low-density area extendinginto the cerebral and cerebellar white matter, but no contrast-enhancementeffect or midline shift was observed. She has since remained in a coma,and repeated CT scans have revealed marked ventricular dilatation. Theclinical course, laboratory data, and CT findings suggest acute disseminatedencephalomyelitis, but acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis cannot exactlybe ruled out. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a widespread white-matterlesion, while positron-emission CT demonstrated a dysfunction in boththe white and gray matter.</TEXT></DOC>
