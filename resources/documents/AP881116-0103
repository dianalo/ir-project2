Former U.S. Army Sgt. James Henry Bush, 40, a Vietnam War veteranfrom Raleigh, N.C., and Curtis Hayes Williams, 45, of Jersey City,N.J., said they would return to the United States on Thursday.   Mike Jackson, a Liberian living in exile in Ivory Coast andcharged in the same case, also was ordered freed.   A grand jury in September indicted Bush, Jackson and Williams oncharges of involvement in a July 13 coup attempt allegedly led byDoe's former second in command, Maj. Gen. Nicholas Podier.   ``I'm overjoyed he's coming home. He hasn't seen his baby girlyet,'' said Williams' wife, Gwendolyn Williams, in Jersey City. Mrs.Williams gave birth 10 weeks ago to a baby her husband has not seen.   Doe said in a statement Tuesday he ordered charges against thethree dropped as a ``manifestation of good will to the U.S.President-elect George Bush.''   The three were charged with illegally entering Liberia with theintent of overthrowing the government and killing Doe, offensespunishable by death.   Minister of Justice Jenkins Scott said: ``The individualsinvolved ... have written to the president and expressed theirapology for their involvement with Podier. I think justice has beenproperly served and that the individuals expressed their regrets.''   Scott said the letter was written in the presence of thedefendants' attorneys.   Doe said his action was ``based upon the long-standing andcordial relationship between the government and the people ofLiberia and the government and people of the United States ofAmerica.''   The West African nation was established in 1847 by formerAmerican slaves.   Five members of the purported coup plot, including Podier, werekilled in a July 13 clash with Liberian security men.   The government said the coup plotters entered the country fromIvory Coast on July 10 near the village of Gbolay. They purportedlyhid in the forest, but were discovered by security forces on July 13and a firefight ensued.   Doe, then an army master sergeant, took power in an April 12,1980, coup, overthrowing the government of William Tolbert andkilling the civilian leader.</TEXT></DOC>
