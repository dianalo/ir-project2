This year, for example, a record $265 million in taxes paid byhunters, fishermen and boaters will be made available to helpfinance state fish and wildlife restoration programs.   ``Once again, hunters and fishermen have made recordcontributions to state fish and wildlife restoration efforts throughthe federal excise taxes they pay on hunting and fishing eqipment,''said Secretary of the Interior Don Hodel.   Those restoration efforts provide and protect habitat _ fornongame animals as well as the game animals sportsmen pursue. Forexample, whooping cranes, the most endangered of the world's 15species of cranes, winter on national wildlife refuges financed bywaterfowl huters.   ``This investment by hunters, fishermen and supporting industriesresults in many wildlife enhancement activities that will benefitall Americans,'' said Frank Dunkle, director of the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service.   The two major federal program are the Pittman-Robertson program,which is financed by an 11 percent excise tax on sporting arms andammunition and certain archery equipment, and a 10 percent tax onhandguns.   Fisheries and boating projects are financed by theDingell-Johnson, Wallop-Breaux programs, which place a 10 percenttax on most fishing tackle and other taxes on other gear used to gofishing.   In addition the ``duck stamp'' which must be purchased by huntersseeking migratory waterfowl, brings in millions of dollars each yearto finance the National Wildlife Refuge System.   A study by the Wildlife Conservation Fund of America foundhunters, fishermen and trappers paid $1.1 million in license fees in1986 _ or 53.4 percent of the revenue collected by state wildlifeand fisheries agencies. Federal payments to these agencies _ thereturn of sportsmen's excise taxes _ contributed another 17.1percent.   ``Other revenue'' accounted for 13.4 percent of the wildifeagencies budgets. That included voluntary contributions byindividual sportsmen as well as the large sums raised byconservation groups, such as Ducks Unlimited, the Foundation forNorth American Wild Sheep, the National Wild Turkey Federation, theRuffed Grouse Society and scores of others.   General fund revenue was 14.2 percent and the rest was interestincome.   But, the study noted, sportsmen directly pay a percentage of thegeneral fund revenue as part of their hunting and fishingactivities. A large portion of state revenues is generated by thesales tax and sportsmen pay sales tax on every rod, reel, boat,rifle, shotgun and piece of outdoor gear they buy for hunting orfishing.</TEXT></DOC>
