The tests revealed 434 carriers of the AIDS virus to date,of which 63 had developed the disease and 27 died from it. Ofthose who tested positive, 315 were men and 119 were women.Their average age was 26, the youngest a girl of 15 and theoldest a man of 57.   The Cuban government says it has managed to control thespread of the disease on the island by means of massivetesting and obligatory segregation of AIDS patients in aspecial clinic. Patients can work and receive a salary whilebeing treated at the clinic.   The importation of blood products has been banned in Cubasince 1983.                                                                                                          SOUTH KOREA'S `FX' PROJECT                                                                                                          South Korea will spend $77 million on developing afacsimile machine to compete with similar products in Japanand other countries. Yonhap, the South Korean news agency,said the &quot;FX&quot; project was approved by government officialsbecause Japan and other nations were reluctant to transfertheir advanced technology. Yonhap said South Korea wants tobegin exports of the machine in 1995.                                                                                                          DRASTIC MEASURES IN GREECE                                                                                                          The newly elected Greek government announced drastic pricerises and higher indirect taxes. The measures are intended toincrease state income by 400 billion drachmas ($2.43 billion)this year but will increase the annual inflation rate by 4percentage points, Economy Minister George Souflias said;last year's rate was 15%. Said Mr. Souflias: &quot;Of every 100drachmas the state spends it has to borrow 40. This has tocome to an end.&quot;                                                                                                          NEW ZEALAND EMIGRATION                                                                                                          New Zealand's net population loss through emigration hasslowed sharply, the Department of Statistics said. Thedepartment said that in the 12 months ended March 31, netloss through migration movements fell 83.6% to 4,040 persons,down from a net loss of 24,708 persons in the 12 months endedMarch 31, 1989. The net loss in the 12 months to March wasthe smallest net loss in six years. New Zealand last recordeda net gain in population through migration in the 12 monthsended March 31, 1984. At the last census, in 1986, NewZealand's population totaled 3.3 million people.                                                                                                          NORWEGIAN TV PROPOSAL                                                                                                          Norway's government proposed opening national airwaves toprivate television broadcasts and lifting an almost-total banon TV commercials. The proposal to parliament calls for thecreation of a second channel, funded by up to 30 minutes aday of advertising. The one existing channel, financed byviewer licenses and state transfers, has had a near monopolyon radio and TV broadcasts since it was founded in 1933.                                                                                                          A NO-TAX PLEDGE IN GERMANY                                                                                                          Helmut Seiters, the chief of staff of the West Germangovernment, said the German economic and monetary union willbe financed with the help of strong economic growth, a risein the budget deficit and spending cuts -- but without anytax increases. Speaking in the West German parliament, hesaid: &quot;Tax increases aren't necessary.&quot; The strong rise ingross national product, which is expected to climb 4% thisyear, should boost tax revenue by 30 billion marks (about $18billion) in 1990 and 1991, Mr. Seiters said.                                                                                                          CHINA CHANGES COURSE                                                                                                          China has dropped its earlier opposition to Hong Kong'splan for a multibillion dollar port and airport complex,Chinese officials said.   The Hong Kong-based officials said the economic-researchunits of China's state-owned companies in the British colonywere examining the project to see if China could take part.Experts from the New China News Agency, the de facto Chineseembassy in Hong Kong, and the Bank of China group, China'smajor financial arm, are monitoring and analyzing the plan,they said.   Hong Kong's governor, Sir David Wilson, unveiled planslast year for a $16.28 billion complex, including a newinternational airport, a high-speed rail link, a six-lanehighway and a new port. The project, to be financed by thegovernment and the private sector, is seen as demonstratingconfidence that Hong Kong will remain a vibrant internationalcenter after China regains sovereignty in 1997.   Chinese officials have said they oppose using Hong Kong'scash reserves for the airport, saying the money was intendedfor territorial government after 1997. A Bank of Chinaofficial said: &quot;Basically we have no objection to the plansbecause it eventually serves Hong Kong. But we must ensure itwill not become a burden to us when the British are gone.&quot;                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Playwright Eugene Ionesco said the return of ex-KingMichael was the only way of ending unrest in Romania. &quot;Only aking could halt the debacle in poor Romania,&quot; theRomanian-born dramatist, now a resident of France, wrote inParis's Le Figaro. . . . A Chernobyl telethon run by SovietTV last week raised millions of rubles and dollars forchildren who suffered from the world's worst nucleardisaster, Tass reported. Contributions reportedly ranged from$500,000 from a family company in Australia to dozens ofdollars donated by individuals.</TEXT></DOC>
