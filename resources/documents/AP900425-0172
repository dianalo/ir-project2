Many members of the legislature, the Supreme Soviet, criticizedthe plan as inadequate to deal with the health, agricultural,economic and environmental aftermath of the Ukraine accident.Legislator Yuri Scherback estimated 250 billion rubles ($405billion) are needed over the next 10 years.   Official reports say 31 people were killed when one of fourreactors at Chernobyl caught fire and exploded April 26, 1986.Unofficial reports say 250 died. The blast spewed cesium, strontiumand plutonium across much of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russiaand sent a cloud of radioactive gas around the world.   After a day of debate, including charges of an official cover-upof the disaster and bungled evacuations, the Supreme Sovietendorsed a program drafted by the three affected republics and thecentral government for dealing with Chernobyl from 1990-92, Tassnews agency reported. About 180,000 to 200,000 people still livingin contaminated areas will be resettled.   About 116,000 people were evacuated in the months after theaccident, and some Soviet scientists and politicians have beencampaigning since then for further resettlements. They say 4million Soviets are living on contaminated land.   Wednesday's resolution also provides for stepping up medical aidto residents of the contaminated zone and stabilizing radiationlevels.   Many residents have complained of inadequate medical care. Casesof anemia, leukemia and cancers have been reported rising amongpeople living on irradiated land. Many residents still eatirradiated food because alternatives are not available.   After years of passivity, the people suffering have been stagingdemonstrations this week. Further protests are planned Thursday,the fourth anniversary, in Byelorussia and the Ukraine.   A 24-hour world telethon for Chernobyl victims began in MoscowWednesday night and had raised $4.8 million in the first few hours,Tass reported. CNN showed live scenes of the telethon to U.S.viewers. Many of the donations came from the United States, Japanand Western Europe, Tass said.   Protesters demand trials for the officials who concealed theextent of the danger and delayed evacuating contaminated areas;better medical care for victims; and the import of radiation-freefood.   Dealing with the larger questions posed by Chernobyl, theSupreme Soviet directed the government to draft a bill on the useof nuclear energy and nuclear safety, and to phase out theChernobyl power plant. The plant's three remaining reactors arestill operating. The Ukrainian legislature wants the plant closedby 1995.   Several other nuclear power projects around the country werecanceled because of heightened safety concerns generated byChernobyl.   Scherbak, from the Ukraine, told a news conference Wednesday aparliamentary commission should be set up to examinedecision-making in the Chernobyl disaster, and to determine whichhigh government officials were responsible for slow reaction to itand the cover-up.   Fellow legislator Yuri Voronezhtsev, from Byelorussia, toldreporters the commission is needed to single out officials stillstanding in the way of a full accounting and cleanup.   ``The main thing is not to bring criminal charges against people... but there are people who have not acknowledged their mistakeswho are braking things today,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
