Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told diplomats a meeting of theruling Communist Party's policy-making Politburo would be calledThursday or Friday, perhaps signaling the behind-the-scenes powerstruggle between Li and Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang wascoming to a head.   Wan Li, head of China's parliament, cut short a visit to theUnited States and flew home Wednesday for what he said were``health reasons.'' But U.S. officials thought he was hurrying backto demand Li's ouster.   China's political crisis was touched off by student protests fora freer society and cleaner government that began in mid-April.Tens of thousands of students remained in a tent city at TiananmenSquare, the symbolic center of power in China, for a 12th dayWednesday to press the demands.   Protest marches continued throughout the nation, withdemonstrations reported Wednesday in Shanghai and Changsha, thecapital of Hunan province.   Li declared martial law in Beijing on Saturday to restore orderto the city where more than 1 million residents have demonstratedin support of the students.   The crackdown, apparently made with the approval of seniorleader Deng Xiaoping, triggered widespread calls for Li's ouster.   Troops deployed on the outskirts of Beijing since Friday wereprevented from moving on the square by throngs of people whosurrounded the convoys and built street barricades. The crowdspleaded with the soldiers not to attack and they retreated intobarracks, leading to speculation that Li could not control themilitary.   However, the army Headquarters of General Staff and GeneralPolitical Department published a letter Wednesday in the militarynewspaper strongly supporting Li's hard-line position against thestudents.   The letter was dated Monday, the same day more than 100 seniorarmy officers called for an end to martial law, and it indicated anapparent split in the military.   ``In this serious political struggle that affects the futurefate of the nation ... the troops will face every kind ofdifficulty and test in their task of ending the disturbance andrestoring normal order,'' the letter said.   It urged the troops to study a tough speech Li made Friday andan April 26 People's Daily editorial criticizing the students, inorder to ``fully understand the nature of this struggle and themission of enforcing martial law.''   ``A extreme minority of people are fanning the flames, creatingturmoil, with the goal of negating the leadership of the ChineseCommunist Party and the socialist system,'' it said. ``In the faceof this great struggle between truth and falsehood, we mustmaintain a clear mind.''   Widespread military support of the crackdown was reported by theofficial Xinhua News Agency. It said six of seven army commands,the air force and navy approved. Only the Beijing command was notmentioned.   The official China News Service reported 26 of 31 provincesannounced support for the government's decision to maintain socialorder in Beijing by calling in troops.   The 3.2 million-member People's Liberation Army is likely to becrucial in resolving the ongoing political standoff. Thegrassroots-style military played a key role in the revolution ledby Mao Tse-tung that created communist China, and it also was usedin previous power struggles, most recently in the 1966-76 CulturalRevolution.   Contradictory rumors continued to swirl about the fate ofChina's top leaders. Zhao was reported to receive backing from HuQili, a member of the five-person Politburo Standing Committee incharge of propaganda, and Ba Jin, the country's most famous livingwriter.   Adding an ominous note was China's decision to cut off for asecond time satellite transmissions by Western TV networks.   Western broadcasters were told their ability to transmit fromChina ended as of midnight Wednesday (11 a.m. EDT Wednesday). Anearlier ban on transmitting videotape was lifted the day before.   President Bush called on Beijing to stop jamming Voice ofAmerica radio and refrain from violence against protesters. Bush,who met Tuesday with Wan, also expressed his commitment to strongU.S.-China relations, and the two discussed the recent Soviet-Sinosummit, the White House said.   Although Tiananmen remained the focus of the protest, many ofthe students from Beijing University who began the sit-in at thesquare May 13 have returned to school to do organizational work.   A large proportion of the students now in Tiananmen have arrivedfrom out of town to be at the center of the historic pro-democracymovement.   ``I have come to Beijing to take part in a great revolution,''said Ji Xiujie, a 20-year-old university junior from Sichuanprovince.   The fifth day of martial law passed with life returning tonormal in the capital. Fewer barricades were up to snarl trafficafter most troops withdrew from street deployment Monday night.   Xinhua reported 172 of 174 Beijing bus routes were in operationby Wednesday morning. Subway service also resumed. Main shoppingstreets were crowded and markets were well-stocked with food anddaily items.</TEXT></DOC>
