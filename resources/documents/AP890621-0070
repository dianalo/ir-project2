The Bush administration was expected to propose verificationmeasures aimed at speeding progress on a treaty with the SovietUnion.   It was not clear when or in what detail the U.S. side wouldpresent its proposals. Both sides were observing an official newsblackout in Geneva on the substance of the talks.   On Tuesday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said a pact tocut each side's long-range nuclear forces is part of ``the nextphase'' in disarmament.   ``The basis for this already exists, and the oustanding questionsare not insurmountable as far as we are concerned if the two partiesmake the necessary efforts,'' Gorbachev said in a message carried bythe official Tass news agency.   The two new chief arms negotiators, Richard Burt and YuriNazarkin, led their delegations in the first full meeting of the11th round of talks, a 2{-hour session at the U.S. mission. Talksbegan in March 1985.   The negotiations are on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,intended to cut long-range nuclear forces, and space and defenseissues. The talks are aimed at reducing U.S. and Soviet long-rangebombers, missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent.   This round, due to last about six weeks, began Monday with ameeting of the two delegation heads.   Both Burt and Nazarkin made plain that their public positionsremain unchanged on several major issues, including mobile nuclearmissiles.   On Tuesday, President Bush suggested he might back away from U.S.insistence on banning these weapons if Congress approves a plan forupgrading U.S. strategic forces, according to congressional leaderswho met with him.   The plan would include funding for both the 10-warhead MX and thesingle-warhead Midgetman missiles.   Two other disputes center on U.S. plans for space-based missiledefenses and whether to include long-range sea-launched cruisemissiles in START.   Under a U.S. anti-cheating plan outlined by Bush on Monday, bothsides would begin tackling the tricky problem of verification earlyby testing monitoring procedures during the talks, rather thanwaiting until the treaty is completed.   The Washington Post quoted an unidentified official in Washingtonas saying such trial inspections would involve round-the-clockmonitoring of some ballistic missile factories and on-site checks ofmissile warheads. The proposal also was reported to include a ban onsome missile flight tests.</TEXT></DOC>
