The proposed amendments modify portions of the Kentucky AdministrativeRegulations (KAR) Title 405 Chapters 8 and 24. Specifically, the proposedamendments revise 405 KAR 8:010 by including information on the natureand location of archaeological resources on public and Indian lands asconfidential information, and by adding a requirement for a new writtenfindings by the Cabinet relating to properties listed or eligible for listingon the National Register of Historic Places. The proposed amendments revise405 KAR 8:020 to require the inclusion of information on cultural, historic,and known archaeological resources in the narrative description of eachexploration and reclamation operations plan. The proposed amendments revisethe permit requirements at 405 KAR 8:030 and 405 KAR 8:040 to specify thatKentucky may require the applicant to identify and evaluate important historicand archaeological resources. In addition, the proposed regulations requirethat each plan contain a description of measured to be used to preventadverse impacts to public parks or places listed on the National Registerof Historic Places and allows the cabinet to require the applicant to utilizeappropriate mitigation and treatment measures.

The public hearing will continue on the specific date until all personsscheduled to testify have been heard.

Procedural Determinations </ITAG>1. <T3>Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act: </T3>The Secretaryhas determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1292(d),no environmental impact statement need be prepared on this rulemaking.2. <T3>Executive Order No. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act: </T3>OnJuly 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMREan exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive Order 12291 foractions directly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, this action is exempt from preparation of a RegulatoryImpact Analysis and regulatory review by OMB. The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule would nothave a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule would not impose any new requirements; rather,it would ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA and theFederal rules will be met by the State. 3. <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act: </T3>This rule does not contain informationcollection requirements which require approval by the Office of Managementand Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subject in 30 CFR Part 917 </ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="6">Carl C.
