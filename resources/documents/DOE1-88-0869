There is no simple answer. A cogeneration plant is capitalintensive. The matching process is critical. Development of an optimumdesign concept is both plant-specific and site-specific. Energy managersin some major plants may have access to a sizeable in-company engineeringdepartment experienced in conceptual design of power systems and ableto analyze their performance in terms of energy and economy. Most energymanagers, however, must seek outside assistance, first from consultantsand later from architect and engineering firms. The optimal end resultin both cases is the same: a conceptual design of a cogeneration systemwhich meets the needs of the industrial process and is economically viable.A clear understanding of both the potential and limitations of such asystem the energy manager's ability to direct such a conceptual designwhile staying within acceptable cost limits. He must be acutely awareof the design's interaction with power and heat demand and with economicperformance as a function of energy costs and escalation rates. Thisdiscussion addresses these questions from the viewpoint of the end user,addressing important technical aspects of cogeneration.</TEXT></DOC>
