Intelsat said Ford could earn as much as $130 million additionally over the next 10 years if the satellites meet the group's performance standards. Intelsat provides satellite services that beam telephone calls and television signals between countries. Ford Aerospace is a unit of Ford Motor Co. of Dearborn, Mich.    Intelsat said the first two satellites will orbit above the Pacific Ocean and replace older Intelsat satellites. The agency hasn't selected a rocket company to launch the satellites, which are to be placed aloft in mid-1992 and early 1993. </TEXT></DOC>
