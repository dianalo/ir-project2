The plans of Ameritech, based in Chicago, would mark thefirst time that a Baby Bell has offered a combined callingand credit card to their customers. Analysts said they expectthe other Bell companies to issue similar cards soon.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We are only examining an entry at this point,&quot; said anAmeritech spokesman, declining to comment further.   However, Ameritech may have no choice but to expand itscustomers' charge privileges. Its regular calling cards, likethose issued by its siblings, have come under increasingcompetition from other cards that offer credit and callcharging through such long-distance carriers as MCICommunications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co.   In addition, Ameritech's new card would follow AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s hugely successful Universalcredit card. The ATandamp;T card doubles as a calling card andclaims to be one of the top five cards in the nation, with4.9 million accounts, 8.3 million cards, and $1.7 billion inreceivables in its first year.   Ameritech needs to protect its base of 3.5 million callingcards, said David Robertson, a vice president at the NilsonReport, a newsletter based in Santa Monica, Calif., thattracks the credit-card industry. &quot;Especially when theircorporate customers are being offered cards with creditprivileges,&quot; he added.   Mr. Robertson said Ameritech's plan would probably besimilar to Southern New England Telephone Co., which offers aso-called affinity credit card with its logo, but which isissued by an outside bank that handles billing. WhileSouthern New England Telephone doesn't draw income fromreceivables from the card, the phone company can put itscalling card code number on the card, making it easier forcustomers to make calls with the card.   Executive Telecard Ltd., a Swiss company that offersdirect connections to 26 overseas countries, confirmed it isworking with Ameritech to offer charging international callson the new card. Executive Telecard wouldn't comment further.   Ameritech isn't likely to mimic ATandamp;T, which set up a newcard services subsidiary to handle billing, do credit checksand use an outside bank to issue the cards. That's becausenew rules set late last year by Visa and MasterCard for newaffinity partners would prohibit Ameritech from performingsuch back-office services as billing and credit checks nowhandled by member banks, Mr. Robertson noted.</TEXT></DOC>
