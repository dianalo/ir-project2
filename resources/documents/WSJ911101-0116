The vote was a major setback for the Bush administration'sefforts to broaden business opportunities for banks. It cameduring the first of three days of votes on a sweeping bankbill that's so unpopular in the House it may have difficultypassing without major surgery.</LP><TEXT>   The Treasury, the American Bankers Association and severalof the nation's largest banks had lobbied hard against thebanking and securities measure. But they were outmaneuveredby the insurance industry, investment bankers and Housemembers who argued that tight regulation is required toprevent banks from following the savings-and-loan industryinto new lines of business that could trigger a taxpayerbailout.   &quot;The House has turned its back on bank reform,&quot; Rep. TobyRoth (R., Wis.) said after the vote. But House BankingCommittee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) and Energy andCommerce Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.), the authors ofthe provision the House adopted, called the vote a steptoward safer, more uniform regulation of banks that enter thesecurities business.   The Gonzalez-Dingell measure repeals provisions of the1933 Glass-Steagall Act that blocks banks from entering thesecurities business. But while removing this barrier, itimposes a series of rules, or so-called fire walls, on thedealings between banks and their securities affiliates toprevent banks from putting federally insured deposits atrisk.   Some two dozen large bank holding companies, includingCiticorp, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co., alreadyhave securities affiliates that were set up several years agounder a Federal Reserve Board ruling. The House-approvedprovision would allow any well-capitalized bank to set up asecurities affiliate, but the affiliate would operate understricter rules than those set up by the Fed. Citicorp andothers argued that the change would cost them existingbusiness.   In particular, large banks and the administration opposeda fire wall designed to prevent banks from lending tocompanies that offer securities through the bank's brokerageaffiliate. The securities industry argued that the measure isnecessary to prevent banks from forcing their customers touse their securities affiliates for underwriting.   The provision also will roll back some recent victoriesbanks have won from regulators and the courts to enter theinsurance business. It restricts current authority fornational banks to sell insurance in small towns, and itreverses a recent court decision that would have allowedbanks to underwrite and sell insurance nationwide throughinsurance affiliates in Delaware. The Independent InsuranceAgents Association, a powerful lobbying force, worked hard tobuild support for the provision.   The Gonzalez-Dingell measure represented a compromisebetween versions of Glass-Steagall repeal measures adopted bythe House Banking and Energy and Commerce committees.   Rep. Doug Barnard (D., Ga.), working with the help of theadministration, offered an amendment to strike the compromisefrom the bill, thus protecting the status quo. &quot;Thiscompromise is a full step backwards -- a punitive step,&quot; hesaid, arguing that it protects the &quot;special interests&quot; of theinsurance and securities industries.   The Barnard amendment to strip the compromise from thebill failed on a 216-200 vote. The fact that supporters ofthe compromise couldn't muster a majority in the 435-memberHouse, combined with an earlier vote that fell just two votesshort of preventing the banking bill from coming to the floorin the first place, shows the unpopularity of the bankingmeasure.   &quot;I think it's in trouble,&quot; said Rep. Leon Panetta (D.,Calif.). The bill would bolster the shrinking bank depositinsurance fund with $70 billion in new borrowing authority, amove that many House members fear is a step toward a taxpayerbailout of the Bank Insurance Fund.   Still, Congress must vote new money for the depositinsurance fund, which is nearly insolvent, and probably willtighten bank regulation at the same time. But the move togrant banks new powers reminds some lawmakers of thederegulation of the savings-and-loan industry before itscurrent crisis. &quot;It scares the hell out of them,&quot; Mr. Panettasaid. &quot;The safe vote here may be to vote no.&quot;   Administration officials already are arguing that theyhave a better chance of modernizing bank laws in the Senate,which is expected to start considering the bill during theweek of Nov. 11.   The House is scheduled to finish work on the bill Monday.The next big votes will be a series of proposals to allowbanks to branch nationwide, a proposal that the IndependentBankers Association, which represents small banks, and manyrepresentatives of rural areas bitterly oppose.   Shortly after losing on the Barnard amendment, theadministration suffered another defeat when the Houserejected a proposal to allow commercial companies to purchasefailing banks, a change the Treasury said would protecttaxpayers from the cost of bank failures. Rep. Dingell andothers argued that it would set a dangerous precedent toallow commercial companies to acquire banks.   The House also adopted a measure that could force somebanks to rearrange their boards. An amendment by Rep. PaulKanjorsi (D., Pa.) would bar independent legal counsel andaccountants from serving as bank directors. It would requirethat the majority of directors on a bank's board not work atthe bank. This is designed to prevent the type of conflictsthat surfaced during the investigations of the Bank of Creditand Commerce International.</TEXT></DOC>
