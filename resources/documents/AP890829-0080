(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There was ``mass confusion'' in Salemlast year after 13 bombs were stashed around the southern Indianatown, local law enforcement officials testified today.   ``We felt like we were dealing with something we didn't know toomuch about,'' Fire Chief Larry Cooper testified at the trial ofJerry A. Conrad, 42, one of two men accused of planting the bombs.   The prosecutor in the U.S. District Court trial, Assistant U.S.Attorney Robert Stanley Powell, said in his opening statement Mondaythat the town ``was paralyzed'' by the attempted bombings on July 5,1988.   But defense attorney Michael McDaniel said Conrad was an honest,law-abiding citizen and a family man. ``He's never been in troublewith the law,'' McDaniel said.   In today's testimony, Police Chief Max Boling said authoritiescordoned off downtown streets for about 12 hours while teamssearched for more bombs.   ``Nobody could understand what was going on. There was massconfusion for a while as to why they couldn't drive through town,''Boling said.   Conrad and John M. Hubbard III, 31, of Salem are accused ofplanting dynamite bombs under bridges and behind buildings in thetown nearly 30 miles northwest of New Albany on July 5, 1988. Threeof the bombs ignited and fizzled, but none exploded and no one washurt.   The bombs were allegedly targeted at state Rep. Frank Newkirk Jr.Authorities declined to comment on a motive, but a criminalcomplaint called Hubbard a ``lifelong rival'' of Newkirk, who isalso the son of Salem's mayor.   Conrad and Hubbard, who worked at the same factory, were arrestedlast May and indicted on one count of unlawful possession ofdynamite, one count of conspiracy, 14 counts of making bombs and 13of attempting to destroy roads and buildings affecting interstatecommerce.   If convicted, Conrad could be sentenced to up to 285 years inprison. Hubbard is to be tried after Conrad.   Powell said evidence would show that Conrad, a technicalengineer, helped Hubbard make the bombs and that the tools used tomake them belonged to Conrad.   Powell cautioned that much of the government's case was based oncircumstantial evidence.   ``Don't expect somebody to come up and say they saw them makingthe devices,'' Powell said.   McDaniel said that Conrad would not dispute allegations he toldHubbard various things about making bombs, but would deny anyinvolvement in a plot to blow up Salem.   ``The evidence will show he knew how to make bombs,'' McDanielsaid. ``He is a survivalist. He wants to be self-sufficient in theevent of a nuclear war. He wants to be able to sustain himself, hisfamily.''   McDaniel said such people are not part of a ``lunatic fringe''simply because they are concerned about their future and theirfamily's safety.   Conrad, who wore a dark suit and tie, sat quietly at a table inthe courtroom, taking notes on a yellow legal pad.</TEXT></DOC>
