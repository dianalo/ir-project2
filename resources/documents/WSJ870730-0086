The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration charged the company with 121 violations of its record-keeping rules during 1985 and 1986 and the failure to provide complete information on 53 incidents of serious injuries. The citations, which had been expected, are the result of a major investigation undertaken at the facility early this year following a worker's complaint to OSHA.    The shipyard's general manager, William Bennett, called the proposed fine &quot;completely unreasonable&quot; and said the company will contest it. The concern has 15 workdays to contest the citations before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, an independent agency.    &quot;We're alarmed by . . . a trend toward highly excessive fines against companies nationwide for paper-work violations,&quot; Mr. Bennett said. He said the company has corrected the &quot;irregularities&quot; in its records that prompted the charges.    The action follows a Labor Department settlement last week in which Union Carbide Corp. agreed to pay $408,500 in penalties to settle charges that it violated OSHA's record-keeping rules. In addition, Chrysler Corp. said earlier this month that it will pay $1.6 million to settle federal safety charges, and an H.J. Heinz Co. unit was accused of breaching plant safety rules. Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s IBP Inc. unit also was accused of keeping poor records on worker injuries.    Some businessmen and the National Association of Manufacturers believe OSHA's new mood began after sharp criticism of the agency during congressional hearings last spring. During those sessions, the agency was accused of letting companies escape inspections if their safety records were in order. (OSHA officials say they have a regular inspections system and plants can't always escape a review based on their safety data.)    Others say a more complicated set of factors combined to set the agency in motion after several years of relatively slow-paced enforcement.    They say the agency's spree of citations and substantial penalties result from the sharper political pressure imposed both by a Democrat-controlled Congress and the coming presidential race. Labor Secretary William Brock, who became head of the department 2 1/2 years ago, also is credited with combining concerns about those factors with an appreciation of the growing public awareness of health risks in the workplace.    &quot;This wouldn't be happening if it weren't for the coming elections,&quot; says David McAteer, director of the Occupational Safety and Health Law Center, a think tank on those issues. &quot;Bill Brock knows that the Republican Party has to continue to capture the swing votes to remain viable. And he knows that a lot of those votes are among workers who care about these issues.&quot;    Labor Department officials deny that politics is behind OSHA's newly active stance. The agency began about 18 months ago to focus on record-keeping violations, says John Pendergrass, the assistant secretary for occupational safety and health, because it uses the data to decide whether to conduct more complete reviews of manufacturing work sites, and because the records can point out more serious safety hazards.    Mr. Brock also started an effort to give OSHA a more predictable image. &quot;He said we want to be fair but still let people know we'd penalize them when they don't play by the rules,&quot; says David Demarest, a spokesman for the secretary.    Congress also sees the secretary and Mr. Pendergrass, who joined the department last year, as more willing to take action than their predecessors. Under the new regime, OSHA will force private employers to take precautions to ensure that health-care workers don't contract the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. Rep. Thomas Lantos (D., Calif.) asserted during hearings last week that the agency should have acted five years ago to protect workers from contracting the hepatitus-B virus, which kills more than a hundred health-care workers annually.    Rep. Lantos says &quot;a more assertive Congress,&quot; along with the awareness of tragic accidents like those in Bhopal, India, and at the Soviet nuclear plant in Chernobyl, also are responsible for OSHA's active stance. </TEXT></DOC>
