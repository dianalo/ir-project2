Congressional negotiators are considering proposals that would require phone companies to make it hard for kids to call up sexually explicit message services. And, on their own, some phone companies are launching plans to cut off dirty-dialing messages, or, at least, let parents block calls to dial-a-porn numbers from home.    But dial-up services for sports scores, stock quotes, horoscopes and the like worry that restrictions will be placed on their offerings, too, causing a hassle for consumers to call any dial-up service. That could doom the dial-up market, says Bruce Fogel, chairman of Phone Programs Inc., a New York company that offers a dozen dial-up programs. &quot;Pornography will survive, but the information age will come to an end,&quot; he worries.    A House-Senate conference hopes to settle on a dial-a-porn proposal and approve it, perhaps as early as today. But striking a compromise will be tough because lawmakers fiercely disagree about what should be done.    Hardliners, for instance, want a law that bans all obscene and indecent speech over the telephone. &quot;The battle should be carried to the Supreme Court,&quot; argues Rep. William Dannemeyer, a California Republican. Dial-a-porn, he says, &quot;moves sexuality from the human level to the animal level.&quot;    But moderates contend a dial-a-porn ban would probably be unconstitutional. So rather than go through the exercise of trying to ban speech, these lawmakers are turning to technology for a solution.    Dial-a-porn services, which offer recorded messages of women panting and moaning, use the same telephone exchanges, 976 and 900, as more mundane dial-up services. Lawmakers now are privately debating plans that would require phone companies to offer a service where parents could, free of charge, block their home phones from being able to connect with these dial-up exchanges. Other proposals would require consumers that want to use 900 or 976 services either to register in advance or pay by credit card.    House Telecommunications Committee Chairman Edward Markey, who is one of five House lawmakers negotiating on the dial-a-porn issue, figures that these restrictions would keep a lot of kids from calling pornographic services. &quot;The goal is to limit the access of minors,&quot; the Massachusetts Democrat says. &quot;Constitutionally, it's difficult to limit the access by adults.&quot;    But dial-up companies that don't offer steamy messages say that blocking and subscription schemes would kill their businesses. They depend on consumers making snap decisions to call a phone number to get, say, the results of a Lakers-Celtics game.    Annual revenue of general interest dial-up services total about $186 million, estimates Information Industry Bulletin, a Stamford, Conn., industry newsletter. That compares with dial-a-porn revenue of $54 million and revenue of about $90 million from so-called gab lines, where customers call up and chat with others who are on the line. Gab lines have a reputation only slightly better than dial-a-porn among some parents because teen-agers run up steep phone bills talking for hours. Most dial-up services charge about 50 cents a minute, but dial-a-porn messages can run a few dollars for the first minute.    Independent of Congress, several local phone companies already are introducing plans to block calls to porn and gab lines because of complaints by subscribers. Bell Atlantic Corp. plans to block all porn and gab lines in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Customers there that want to dial these services would have to write the phone companies to unblock the lines.    Pacific Bell, a unit of Pacific Telesis Group, lets consumers block calls for free to all 976 dial-up services, and soon plans to give consumers the option of just blocking calls to adult messages or gab lines. So far 450,000 subscribers have signed up for the 976 blocking service. New York Telephone, a part of Nynex Corp., plans to offer -- for a one-time charge of $5 -- call blocking to dial-a-porn and chat lines.    Some Democratic lawmakers want to make these plans mandatory -- and free. According to several plans under consideration, phone companies would be required to assign different phone number exchanges to dial-a-porn services, gab lines and general dial-up services. Telephone companies then could let consumers block dial-a-porn or gab-line numbers, for free, or require consumers to subscribe to those services in advance.    These proposals exempt general interest services but could harm them anyway. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. warns that it will abandon its dial-up service, which uses the 900 exchange, if Congress requires call-blocking or subscription. ATandamp;T says it doesn't have the computer software to comply with the requirement. (ATandamp;T, however, has largely chased dial-a-porn services off the 900 exchange by ending the fees it once paid all dial-up services and refusing to do billing for dial-a-porn concerns.)    Blocking proposals doesn't satisfy anti pornography advocates. Rep. Thomas Bliley, a Virginia Republican who has been campaigning against dial-a-porn for five years, says blocking home phones won't stop kids from finding another phone to call up obscene messages. Brad Curl, co-founder of the National Decency Forum in Washington, D.C., says telephone companies should simply refuse to carry dial-a-porn services. &quot;Why fool around with blocking and screening?&quot; he asks.    But the law governing the shutdown of dial-up services is unclear and varies by jurisdiction. BellSouth Corp.'s Southern Bell unit disconnected dial-a-porn services in Atlanta and Miami in 1984, in actions that were upheld by a federal appeals court in Atlanta. A federal district court in California, however, last year stopped Pacific Bell from disconnecting dial-a-porn services. Now Pacific Bell is suing to cut off a dozen dial-a-porn operators, claiming that under a new California regulation, it can shut down services that &quot;damage&quot; Pacific Bell's reputation.    ---                       Dial-Up Market   Annual revenue from dial-up services total an estimated $330 million.
