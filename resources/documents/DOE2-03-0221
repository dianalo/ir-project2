This is done by creating ideal conditionsfor gases to undergo chemical reactions with water and optional chemicalsin form of a solution. The liquid is sprayed on fumes in a confined area,then filtered and recirculated. When it becomes too inactive to reactwith gases, the circulation is ceased and the impurity-laden mixtureis conducted through a filtering system into a stratification tank. Theconcentrated layers of chemicals are drained to a further reclamationprocess. The provided system enables a particular industry to deal withtheir own particular discharge products and formulate their own chemicaladditives to be effective.</TEXT></DOC>
