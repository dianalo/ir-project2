DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hurricane Hugo did an estimated $1 milliondamage at historic Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor and may haveharmed some endangered wildlife, an Interior Department officialsaid Friday.   Constance Harriman, assistant secretary of the interior for parksand wildlife, said the storm also threatened oxygen supplies to fishat two hatcheries.   Meanwhile, the Interior Department announced that SecretaryManuel Lujan would visit hard-hit Puerto Rico on Saturday, then meetin the Virgin Islands with Gov. Alexander Farrelly on Sunday.   Both Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor were hitby the full force of the hurricane. The bridge from the mainland toSullivan's Island, where Fort Moultrie is located, collapsed.   A 17-foot wall of water reportedly slammed into Fort Sumter,where the first shots of the Civil War were fired. Ms. Harriman saidthe storm caused an estimated $1 million in damage at the fort.   The Park Service had not been able to make an on-site assessment,she said, adding that the fort, some boats and a dock had beendamaged.   Cape Romain, a national wildlife refuge near Charleston that'shome to two red wolves, was also in the path of the hurricane. Thestatus of the wolves, an endangered species, is unknown, she said.   Ms. Harriman said the status of a wild flock of Puerto Ricanparrots at a research station at Boqueron, Puerto Rico, was unknown.However, she said a captive flock at the station, maintained by theFish and Wildlife Service and Forest Service, was safe and thatCoast Guard was bringing in food and water for the birds byhelicopter.   Two inland fish hatcheries in South Carolina, Orangeburg andBear's Bluff, were affected when problems with the power supplycaused made it difficult to get oxygen to the sturgeon and stripedbass, she said. The power was being supplemented with emergencygenerators.   ``Despite extensive damage throughout the Caribbean and theCharleston area, National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Serviceproperties fared relatively well,'' Ms. Harrimann said.   ``All employees in the Caribbean are accounted for, as well asall employees along the path of the hurricane on the mainland.Property damage has been limited to a few areas and it consistsprimarily of employee housing, some vehicle damage, some trailerunit damage and a couple of boats.''   She said much of the employee housing damage was at ChristianstedNational Historic Site on St. Croix in the Virgin Islands, but thatvaluable prehistoric artifacts at the monument, an old fort, werenot damaged. She said they were under guard during the looting thatoccurred after the hurricane.   Ms. Harriman estimated the damage to doors and windows inauxiliary buildings at Puerto Rico's San Juan National Historic Siteat about $350,000.   ``There has been no damage to historical structures that we knowof down in the Caribbean area,'' she said.   Ms. Harriman also said she knew of no damage to the well-knownCape Hatteras lighthouse off the North Carolina coast. About 1,500trees were reported felled at King's Mountain National Military Parkon the border of South and North Carolina, she said.   Great Smoky Mountains National Park received about 4 inches ofrain and had local flooding, she said, adding that Florida's CapeCanaveral National Seashore had higher than usual tides but wasexpected to open over the weekend.   In West Virginia, the national New River was reported risingrapidly and there was concern about flooding downstream, she said.The popular Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park was closedbecause of high winds and falling trees but is expected to bereopened Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
