(214) 234-1769, (800) 733-3729.andM;List Price: $695andM;Requires: IBM AT, PS/2, or compatibles; 1MB RAM; hard disk; EGA or VGAgraphics adapter; mouse; Microsoft Windows 2.0 or later.andM;In short: Micrografx Designer 3.0 is a powerful drawing package for thesophisticated artist.andP;  Its large number of tools make it difficult to masterbut offer the flexibility to do just about anything well.andP;  Type handling hasbeen noticeably improved, and the new version offers enhanced color support,a large clip-art library, and a superb autotracing facility as well.andM;At $695, Micrografx Designer is a powerful drawing package for thesophisticated user.andP;  It's numerous tools and functions are perfectly adaptedfor generating complex illustrations of any kind.andP;  The latest version, 3.0,offers some outstanding enhancements, including on-screen text editing, veryprecise autotracing, 24-bit color support with easy-to-control process colorand spot color separation, and even an on-screen slide show feature.andM;As befits its technical orientation, Designer excels in image and filemanagement.andP;  It supports up to 64 layers for arranging elements and offersuser-definable grids and snap-to guides, as well as CAD-like features such asdimensioning and the ability to move, rotate, and scale shapes numericallyand incrementally.andP;  You can even create lists of image parts.andM;But Designer is also a superb program for freehand illustration.andP;  It hasnumerous easy-to-control drawing tools, with a wide variety of options forcreating straight lines, parabolas, arcs, and Bezier curves witheasy-to-modify handles and control points.andP;  Designer's toolbox contains 17default tools, including tracing and text tools in addition to the usualdrawing and transformation tools.andP;  Since the toolbox and menus are fullycustomizable, you can tailor the system to your needs.andM;You can simulate calligraphic pens by modifying the Angle, Width, and Heightsettings in a dialog box that controls the line-width settings.andP;  Using thesefeatures can give a more natural look to many drawings, especially when youuse them on curved lines.andM;Designer's fills and gradients are powerful and user-adjustable, therebyallowing you to edit and store new patterns.andP;  For example, one option letsyou use a continuous fill over several graphic elements that are notconnected or do not touch each other.andP;  This lets you show a graduated fillacross an entire word, not just each letter.andP;  Designer lacks a shapeinterpolation tool, but its masking feature, which lets you use an outline asa &quot;cookie cutter&quot; for defining the outer shape of finished illustrations,works flawlessly.andM;UNEVEN TEXT HANDLINGandM;Although the new version of Designer has improved text-handling capabilities,it still has some weaknesses in this area.andP;  One of its strongest features isthe ability to show text directly on the screen--a definite improvement overearlier versions, which limited your typing to a pop-up dialog box.andP;  Designercomes with three vector typefaces perfect for use with pen plotters, as wellas outline typefaces (created by Bitstream, URW, and others) in a variety ofstyles.andP;  Micrographx has developed what it calls an &quot;independent&quot; font driverthat allows third-party fonts to be incorporated into Designer withoutextensive format conversions.andM;Designer's text functions give you control over the typestyle, the leading(interline spacing), paragraph indents, and the text alignment.andP;  But it stillhas no support for adjusting the spaces between letters--indeed, the termskerning and tracking do not even appear in Designer's Reference Guide.andP;  Nordoes Designer support automatic word wrap or the alignment of text around anexisting graphic.andP;  Wrapping the text in our jukebox test illustration aroundthe circle to the right of the jukebox was a time-consuming procedurecompared with that of competing software packages: each letter had to beindividually rotated and dragged to its position.andM;Designer does let you convert text into an outline format, which makes iteasier to create special effects by converting all letterforms into graphicelements that you can edit like any other shape.andP;  You can blur, slant, andreflect text, create shadows or drop shadows, and apply gradient and neoneffects.andM;IMPRESSIVE AUTOTRACINGandM;Micrografx Designer imports and exports a great variety of file formats,including .PIC, .WMF, .DRW, and .EPS, and it can incorporate color bitmapsinto your drawings.andP;  AutoCAD .DXF files are easily imported and translatedautomatically.andP;  The program comes with a large clip-art library that includeshundreds of images, and customized clip-art collections are available.andO;Micrografx also offers custom clip-art service to convert trademarks andlogos into resolution-independent outlines that can be output at higherquality than scanned versions.andM;But it's the program's accurate and easy-to-use autotracing feature that isthe most spectacular.andP;  The tracing options let you choose the line type(Bezier curves or polygonal lines), the number of points in the lines (fine,average, and coarse), and the smoothness or degree of corner curvature.andO;Tracing complex images takes a long time and uses lots of memory, especiallyin &quot;fine&quot; mode, but the results are worth the wait; our complex jukebox imagerequired little cleanup work after tracing.andP;  Designer can even trace colorbitmaps and assign colors to a vector output, though the results are not asgood as with black-and-white files.andP;  Bitmaps can also be incorporated intothe final image.andM;24-BIT COLORSandM;Micrografx Designer now supports 24-bit color internally, making it extremelypowerful in the area of palette management.andP;  Palettes can be saved separatelyand are fully editable in either the RGB, HSB (hue/saturation/brightness),and CMYK color models.andP;  Printing color separations in both process and spotcolor modes is also surprisingly easy.andP;  Designer can simulate (with fairlypleasing dithering techniques) up to 16.7 million colors on the screen.andP;  Forthose considering a move to Microsoft Windows 3.0, which supports 16 colorson standard VGA or up to 256 colors on a Video Seven VRAM card, a compatibleversion identical in function to the one that we tested (Designer 3.01) willbe available shortly after this issue reaches you.andM;For putting your artwork on film, Micrografx includes a listing of AuthorizedImaging Centers that can turn Designer files into full-color slides and evenoffers a telecommunications utility to transmit files electronically fromwithin Designer.andP;  The program also supports SCODL output if you prefer to useyour own film recorder.andP;  An intriguing feature for presentations isDesigner's ability to create on-screen &quot;slide shows&quot; fordemonstrations--normally the province of presentation graphics software.andM;Micrografx Designer is a robust and powerful program whose rich complexitywill appeal those who need power and sophistication in graphics.andP;  Masteringthe product's advanced features requires real dedication, but if you'rewilling to invest the time, Designer will do just about anything you need.andM;Luisa Simone and Edward Mendelson are contributing editors of PC Magazine.andO;Isaac Victor Kerlow is the chairman of the computer graphics department atPratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.andP;  Mark Wilson is a West Cornwall,Connecticut--based artist who specializes in computer-generated fine art.andO;Maureen Jones is a New York-based medical and technical illustrator who hastaught at Pratt Institute and at the School of Visual Arts in New York City.andO;Gerard Kunkel is the Director of Design and Electronic Publishing at PCMagazine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
