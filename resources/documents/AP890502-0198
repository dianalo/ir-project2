Other officials said the missile, known as Condor 2, is severalyears away from being tested. ``We expected it to be tested twoyears ago, at least,'' said one official who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   The official said part of the technology required for themissile, which is being developed in Argentina and bankrolled byIraq and Egypt, was withheld by the United States. Other parts wereheld back by U.S. allies.   But ``we worry some technology did manage to get through,'' theofficial said.   Israeli officials have accused West German firms of helping theCondor 2, which could eventually be used to carry nuclear orchemical warheads.   Allen Holmes, assistant secretary of state, told a Senate ArmedServices defense subcommittee that the Condor 2 ``is far behindschedule and we believe this can be traced to problems in acquiringtechnology'' from signatories of the Missile Technology ControlRegime (MTCR).   The MTCR was established to limit the spread of missiles in theThird World. It includes the United States, Japan, West Germany,Britain, France, Italy and Canada.   ``Ballistic missiles _ relatively expensive and relativelydifficult to acquire _ are spread throughout the Third World...,''testified Jim E. Hinds, deputy assistant secretary of Defense, tothe subcommittee on Defense Industry of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee.   ``Cruise missiles are generally cheaper and will become moreavailable. As the hardware for large, unmanned aircraft and moreaccurate guidance systems becomes increasingly widespread, we willbe faced with a new kind of threat.''   Ballistic missiles can be large and highly destructive. Cruisemissiles are smaller and easier to hide.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said there is already enoughtension in the Middle East without the introduction of cruisemissiles.   ``Just in this area, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Libya, SaudiArabia, North and South Yemen all have ballistic weaponscapability,'' he said. ``This is a frightening situation.''   Holmes said the Bush administration is trying to get the SovietUnion and China to cooperate in controlling the sale of missiles,but he made plain he doesn't think such cooperation will solve theproblem.   ``India, Israel and others have independent technologicalcapability to construct large rockets,'' he said.   DeConcini said India is planning to test a new missile calledthe Agni, which could carry a nuclear warhead 1,000 to 1,500 miles.India exploded a single atomic device in 1974.   DeConcini suggested that countries getting U.S. aid be told thatsuch missiles cost billions which could be used for development.</TEXT></DOC>
