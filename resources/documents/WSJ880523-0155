J. Donald Childress, a national partner in Atlanta, and Fred W. Klein, a regional partner in Charlotte, N.C., are the latest to quit since the company reorganized its operations in 1986 to give more control to its Dallas home office. Last summer, 11 Crow partners on the West Coast left the company, citing a desire for a &quot;more free-wheeling, personal type of atmosphere.&quot; Earlier in the year, eight partners in the Chicago office left in a dispute over the restructuring.    George L. Lippe, a regional partner in charge of properties in Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, will direct the Charlotte office in addition to his other duties. A replacement for Mr. Childress wasn't named.    Eleven other Trammell Crow principals in the Southeast, including Charles MacFarlane, division manager in Richmond, Va., are joining the firm being formed by Mr. Childress and Mr. Klein, Childress/Klein Properties.    A Trammell Crow spokesman called the parting of Mr. Childress and Mr. Klein &quot;friendly.&quot; Mr. Klein declined to answer questions about his resignation and Mr. Childress couldn't be reached for comment.    As national partner in Atlanta, Mr. Childress oversaw about 15 million square feet of commercial property in the company's Florida, mid-South and Southeast regions -- some of the healthiest in the Trammell Crow empire. The closely held company, which calls itself the nation's biggest landlord, owns and manages 287.5 million square feet of office, industrial and retail space valued at about $14 billion. But the bulk of its properties are in the battered real-estate markets of the Southwest, and the company has suffered along with other developers in the region from a decline in rents and a shortage of new projects.    Under Trammell Crow's regional system, partners own an equity stake in the properties they develop, and the national office owns the rest. Childress/Klein Properties hasn't reached an agreement with Crow over the division of the Southeast properties, but individuals close to the principals said they don't anticipate litigation such as followed the departure of the Chicago partners.    Last June, those partners and the company agreed to swap interests in a handful of Midwest properties after the partners filed suit for a share of the disputed properties. </TEXT></DOC>
