The chamber gave voice-vote approval Monday to legislation toregulate the use of tributyltin, or TBT, a hull paint additive thatis effective against barnacles but poses dangers to other marinelife.   The bill would ban the use of paints containing TBT on vesselsunder 82 feet in length and would impose limits on the amount ofTBT that can be released into the water from hull paint on largervessels.   The restrictions would last until the Environmental ProtectionAgency decides on an environmentally safe release rate for paintscontaining TBT, which have been regulated by England and Francebecause of damage to shellfish.   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said TBT ``is without a doubt the mosteffective anti-fouling compound yet developed, and it cannot bematched for preventing the attachment of barnacles, algae and othermarine organisms that hasten the decay of wood and cause drag onboats.   ``On the other hand, there is growing evidence that TBT isextremely toxic and is affecting `non-target' marine and freshwaterorganisms rather than just organisms that are trying to grow onboat hulls.''   He said TBT produces toxic effects in some marine organisms atexposures of less than 100 parts per trillion _ ``the equivalent toone drop of water in 100,000 tanker trucks of liquid.''   Chafee said TBT's effects on humans are not known, although highlevels of the substance have been found in some chinook salmon byfederal researchers.   The regulatory legislation originated in the House, which nowwill be asked to consider an amendment approved by the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
