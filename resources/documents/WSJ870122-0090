The No. 3 auto maker said it would continue offering loans for as low as 3.9% and cash rebates ranging from $300 to $1,000. Chrysler originally said the program would run from Dec. 10 until Tuesday, but it renewed the incentives yesterday on most of the same vehicles and didn't set an expiration date.    A Chrysler marketing official said the move was made because &quot;we're trying to take an opportunity to sell our final production capacity.&quot; Asked if he felt incentives were now here to stay, he added, &quot;We think they are.&quot; He said, &quot;The situation is going to be exacerbated, because capacity is going to exceed demand.&quot;    The official, who asked not to be identified, said Chrysler had contemplated stronger incentives but backed off to avoid triggering a response from its competitors. He added, however, that &quot;we think that General Motors Corp. will come to the marketplace with something.&quot; GM has had higher inventory levels than the other car companies, and kicked off the last round of industrywide incentives in August.    GM officials have said they don't plan any company-wide incentives, and a spokesman yesterday said, &quot;We have no corporate-wide incentives to announce.&quot;    But the No. 1 auto maker did weigh in Tuesday with financing incentives and cash rebates on its compact trucks. That program, however, followed similar programs in place at Ford Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co.    The Chrysler program covers 1987 Dodge and Plymouth Colt E, DL and Premier models, Plymouth Reliant and Dodge Aries models, Dodge pickup trucks and the Dodge Ramcharger sport utility vehicle.    Some dealers, however, said they were skeptical that the incentives would help the painfully slow pace at which cars have been selling since the beginning of the year. An unprecedented round of industrywide incentives initiated by GM last fall, as well as a rush to buy cars before the end of 1986 to take advantage of disappearing tax breaks, &quot;vacuumed up everybody even potentially in the market,&quot; said Chuck Yirka, general sales manager of a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership in Fairfax, Va.    Mr. Yirka and other dealers said car sales had picked up in recent days from the early January rate. But he added that he doubted the announcement of the Chrysler incentives would help much more. &quot;The public is used to them now so it's no big deal,&quot; he said. &quot;If it goes away, the public thinks it's just going to come back again.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
