Significantmatrix correlations between genetics and geography were found for themajority of systems; somewhat less frequent are significant correlationsbetween genetics and language. The effects of the two factors can beseparated by means of partial matrix correlations. These show significantvalues for both genetics and geography, language kept constant, and geneticsand language, geography kept constant, with a tendency for the formerto be higher. These findings demonstrate that speakers of different languagefamilies in Europe differ genetically and that this difference remainseven after geographic differentiation is allowed for. The greater effectof geography than of language may be due to the several factors thatbring about spatial differentiation in human populations.</TEXT></DOC>
