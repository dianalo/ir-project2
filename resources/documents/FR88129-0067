Box 251, Houston, Texas 77252, filed an application fora certificate of public convenience and necessity for authorization toabandon the purchase obligation for certain certificated producer salesto Texas Eastern of natural gas related to West Cameron Block 522, offshoreLouisiana.Applicant states that it entered into separate gas purchase agreementswith the Amerada Hess Corporation, Cabot Petroleum Corporation, Case-PomeroyOil Corporation, Felmont Oil Corporation, Kerr-McGee Corporation, LouisianaLand and Exploration Company, Marathon Oil Company and Phillips PetroleumCompany (hereinafter referred to as ``producer-suppliers'') during theperiod of 1975 through 1977 to purchase natural gas from reserves locatedwithin the southern boundary of West Cameron Block 522.Applicant states that it entered into three separate transportation agreementsto transport the natural gas to Applicant's onshore facilities. Pursuantto a transportation agreement with Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America(Natural) dated January 28, 1976, the gas purchased from the producer-supplierswas transported by Natural from the purchase point at the platform in WestCameron Block 543 through Natural's 16&quot; line to an interconnection withStingray Pipeline Company (Stingray) located in West Cameron Block 565.This Natural transport was permanently authorized by Commission order datedJune 26, 1980 in Docket No. CP76-278-000 (11 FERC andpara; 61,327).Applicant states that in order to provide transportation beyond West CameronBlock 565, Applicant entered into two transportation agreements with TrunklineGas Company (Trunkline), both dated March 22, 1976. The first agreementprovided for the transportation of natural gas by Trunkline through itscapacity entitlement in the Stringray system. This gas was transportedto a Stingray/Natural onshore Louisiana interconnection. Natural providesa transportation service for Trunkline and delivers the natural gas toa Trunkline/Natural interconnection in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. The secondTrunkline agreement provided for the transportation through Trunkline'swholly-owned facilities to an interconnection with Applicant in Allen Parish,Louisiana. A certificate authorizing the Trunkline transports was grantedby Commission order dated March 22, 1976, in Docket No. CP76-310-000 (56FPC 399). Under Trunkline's rate schedules T-7 and T-8, Applicant paysa combined monthly demand charge of $59,070 per month.Since December, 1985, Applicant has not received any gas deliveries underthe producer-supplier gas purchase agreements. On April 17, 1986, the producers-suppliers,with the exception of Amerada Hess Corporation, were notified that Applicantwas terminating the gas purchase agreements because of insufficient deliverycapacity by providing sellers with the required one hundred and fifty (150)days written notice stipulated in the purchase agreements. The agreementswere therefore terminated September 14, 1987. Applicant alleges that dueto administrative oversight, Amerada Hess was not notified until October29, 1987, of Applicant's decision to terminate. Applicant has submitteda letter agreement to Amerada Hess verifying the termination of the gaspurchase agreement and expects the execution of such in the near future.Applicant and Trunkline executed a letter agreement dated February 25,1986, which provided for the termination of the two transportation agreementseffective July 1, 1987.
