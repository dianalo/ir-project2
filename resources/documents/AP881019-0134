(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man accused of masterminding a schemeto claim a $15.2 million lottery jackpot with a fake ticket pleadedguilty Wednesday in Dauphin County Court.   Henry Arthur Rich, 33, pleaded guilty to theft by deception,criminal conspiracy, forgery, tampering with public records, theftby unlawful taking and unlawful use of a computer. Judge SebastianD. Natale waived sentencing until an investigation into Rich'sbackground and character is completed.   Rich, a former employee of Control Data Corp., the firm thatprovides computer services to the lottery, faces a 5- to 10-yearsentence for his role in the scam to claim a jackpot from the July15, 1987, drawing.   Rich's accomplice, Mark Herbst, 33, has already pleaded guiltyto theft, forgery and conspiracy.   Herbst, a former video store clerk, was recruited by Rich topresent the forged ticket on April 28 and split the jackpot,prosecutors said. He later cooperated with the authorities in theirinvestigation of Rich.   Deputy Attorney General Michael J. Kane said Rich agreed toplead guilty to all the counts in return for a concurrent sentence.   Defense lawyer Harry Goldberg said he would ask the court forprobation or a lesser sentence because Rich has no prior criminalrecord and has cooperated with investigators.   Rich allegedly altered a computer program to produce a duplicateof the winning ticket, which had been unclaimed for almost a year.When Herbst appeared at lottery headquarter's to claim his firstcheck for almost $470,000, he told officials that he had been usingthe ticket as a bookmark and had forgotten about it until he read anewspaper article on the prize.   Several days later, lottery officials stopped payment on thecheck and questioned Herbst.   Two top lottery officials have been required to pay a monetarypenalty because of their actions in the case.   A New Jersey couple later claimed the prize.</TEXT></DOC>
