LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Riot police used armored vans and teargas Saturday in violent clashes with workers, students anddissidents calling for the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo.   Six armored vans fired volleys of the choking gas into crowds atKorea University as riot troopers battled with protesters for aboutfive hours in and around the campus in eastern Seoul.   The estimated 1,000 students and dissidents at theanti-government rally, counterattacked with firebombs, rocks andclubs. Students claimed about 30 protesters were injured.   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Overthrow the dictatorship!''demonstrators yelled.   About 3,000 police questioned students entering the campus anddetained several.   Police do not usually stop protests on campus grounds, butauthorities have recently ordered a crackdown against radicals.   In a separate incident at Dongkuk University in the capital'sdowntown, about 1,000 riot police fired tear gas at students andworkers gathered for a protest.   Police led away dozens of protesters who bombarded them withfirebombs and rocks. They gave no figures on arrests or injuries.   The government also banned a rally planned Sunday by militantlabor unions demanding better pay and working conditions forindustrial workers.   Police said the rally posed a threat to ``social order.'' Laborleaders said the rally would go ahead despite the ban and theyurged some 20,000 workers to attend.   General support for the radical student movement and dissidentgroups has waned recently, following a rise in extremism andviolent tactics.   The radicals demand the ouster of the 43,000 U.S. troopsstationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact. They say thesoldiers hinder the reunification of South Korea with CommunistNorth Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
