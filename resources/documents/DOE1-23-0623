<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-23-0623 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two alternative discharge structures, which are both convenient for theextraction of broad and reactive ion beams, are described. They havebeen designed in order to overcome both lifetime and beam contaminationproblems while preserving a high ionization efficiency and a smooth plasmauniformity. They both use a hot cathode duoplasmatron discharge to injectionizing electrons into the main ionization chamber, according to thetriplasmatron concept. The triplasmatron multipolar ion source (TMIS)uses the magnetic multipolar containment of both electrons and ions,whereas the triplasmatron reflex ion source (TRIS) uses the electrostaticand geometric containment of the ionizing electrons. The behaviour andperformance of both structures are reported and discussed with a specialemphasis to the operation with either oxygen or fluorocarbon gases.</TEXT></DOC>
