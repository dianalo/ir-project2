The results of the analysis indicate thatthe high Tc of this compound is associated with the double-layer La{sub3}Ba{sub 3}Cu{sub 6}O(4+y) perovskite structure and that the very highreported transition temperatures (above 90 K) are possible due to thelarge number of vacant oxygen sites and also to the very strongly two-dimensionalnature of the compound. 5 references.</TEXT></DOC>
