The ports in the zones and the adjacent port of Chongjinare to be designated for free trade in Pyongyang's easing ofits closed-door economic policy.   North Korea has had severe economic difficulties followinga decline in trade and aid from the defunct Soviet Union. Thenew zones also are intended to boost Pyongyang's economic andtrade relations with other countries.   The foreign incentives, such as income tax and customsreductions or exemptions, for businesses in the zones wouldvary according to the character of the investments.                                                                                                          SINGAPORE BANS CHEWING GUM                                                                                                          Singapore will ban the import, sale and manufacture ofchewing gum, effective Friday. The nation termed used gum a&quot;perennial nuisance&quot; in public facilities, such as subwaycars where sticky wads have jammed doors and stalled trains.In a further clampdown on litter, Singapore introducedlegislation to force offenders to do public cleanup work.Litterbugs already must attend a counseling session and pay afine of 150 Singapore dollars (US$92); those who refusecounseling may be fined up to S$1,000.                                                                                                          CHILE ATTRACTS CASH INFLUX                                                                                                          Chile this year attracted about $1 billion in foreigninvestment, a sum equal to 13% of the gross domestic product.The influx of cash, which shows no sign of slowing, resultedfrom legislative changes a decade ago guaranteeing profitremittances and protecting investments. Those changes haveled to more than 3,000 contracts with businesses from morethan 54 countries. Santiago said return on investment hasexceeded 30% on average in the past six years.                                                                                                          VIETNAM'S EXPORTS EXCEED TARGET                                                                                                          Vietnam exported goods valued at about $1.9 billion thisyear, exceeding its target by 11% and rising 10% from a yearearlier to equal imports. Import-export operations jumped 62%to 486, including six that are privately owned. Early thisyear, Hanoi responded to the loss of its traditional Eastbloc markets by seeking new Asian and Western partners,encouraging production of export goods, and tighteningcontrol over and altering priorities on imports and exports.In this year's first 10 months, Vietnam and foreign firmssigned agreements for 114 joint investment projects valued ata total of $1.27 billion; since the 1988 liberalization, morethan 300 projects capitalized at $2.5 billion have beenlicensed.                                                                                                          ASIAN ECONOMIC ZONE STUDIED   Chinese officials and Taiwan economists have begunfeasibility studies on establishing an economic zone thatwould group countries and areas in the Asian region dominatedby ethnic Chinese. At a Beijing meeting, preliminary studieswere mapped for the proposed Great China Economic Zone, whichwould include southeastern China, Taiwan, Macao, Hong Kongand Singapore. Formal discussions on the zone are expected tobe held in Hong Kong next month.                                                                                                          URUGUAY UNVEILS PRIVATIZATIONS                                                                                                          Uruguay said its state phone company ANTel and airlinePluna would be sold next year. International bids will besolicited in March and the two companies could be sold byNovember. The privatizations are part of President LuisLacalle's efforts to invigorate an economy beset by inflationand low growth. Much of Montevideo's funds are allotted tounprofitable state companies. Separately, the government saidit was planning to remove restrictions on auto imports.                                                                                                          JAPAN'S FOREIGN APPETITE SOURS                                                                                                          Mergers and acquisitions of foreign corporations byJapanese companies this year plunged 34% to 259 from a yearearlier, Daiwa Securities Co. said. The value of these dealstotaled 434.89 billion yen ($3.46 billion), off 79%.   The sharp declines were attributed to rapid deteriorationin conditions for equity and other means of financing, whilemany companies were running low on cash. Foreign firms alsolost their attractiveness because of waning profitability andworsening external conditions, such as recessionaryeconomies.   Meanwhile, mergers and acquisitions of Japanese firms byforeign concerns dropped 18% to 14, though total spending onthese deals soared 731% to 177.921 trillion yen, skewed by alarge purchase.   Among Japanese companies alone, mergers and acquisitionsfell 19% to 246, while these transactions' value totaled434.887 billion yen, up 28%, again because of some largeindividual deals.
