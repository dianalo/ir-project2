Walsh.   The Sept. 25, 1985 memo was written to Meese by his old friend,E. Robert Wallach, about a proposed Middle East oil pipeline.Wallach accurately describes Israel's help in arranging the U.S.arms-for-hostages swap with Iran just 10 days earlier. And thatswap is central to Walsh's probe.   The memo provides the first link between the pipeline affair andthe Iran-Contra episode, and may provide clues to the motivationsand knowledge of key players in each. And it is likely to provokeyet another appearance by Meese before Walsh's grand jury.   In an operation then known only to a handful of high U.S.officials, Israel brokered the sale of 504 TOW missiles to Iran for$6 million and provided a transfer point for arms shipments on Aug.20 and Sept. 15 _ the day the Rev. Benjamin Weir was released byhis pro-Iranian captors in Lebanon.   McKay, who is investigating Meese's involvement in Wallach'sefforts to win U.S. government financial support for the pipelineproject, recently turned the memo over to Walsh, the independentcounsel investigating the Iran-Contra affair, according togovernment sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.   In the ``For Your Eyes, Only'' memo, Wallach reported to Meesethat Bruce Rappaport, a Swiss businessman who was promoting the $1billion pipeline project, ``indicates that (then-Israeli PremierShimon) Peres emphatically indicated that the release of Weir was aresult of the efforts of the state of Israel and no one else.''   ``He indicated that they would also arrange for the release ofthe remaining six (American hostages). There is a feeling that theU.S. `owes' and that the accomplishment of this project, asoutlined in my memo, is appropriate,'' Wallach wrote.   Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer, goes on to say the Israelis are``a bit frustrated as to why the U.S.G. (U.S. government) has notmore directly facilitated the accomplishment'' of the pipelineproject. Rappaport was seeking U.S. support to ensure that Israelwould not attack the pipeline, which was to have run from Iraqthrough Jordan near the Israeli border to the Gulf of Aqaba.   McKay is trying to determine whether a reference in the memo tothe proposed payment of $650-$700 million in pipeline proceeds over10 years to Israel and Peres' Labor Party should have alerted Meeseto a possible violation of a law that prohibits bribery of foreignofficials.   Meese has said he does not remember reading in detail thesection dealing with the proposed payments, which immediatelyprecedes the reference to Israel's role in obtaining Weir's release.   Walsh is likely to question Meese and Wallach about whetherthere was any ``quid pro quo'' between Israel's role in thearms-for-hostage deal and any U.S. government financial support forthe pipeline _ which was never built.   The September, 1985 memo's description of a key Israeli role inthe arms-for-hostage deal appears to undercut Meese's congressionaltestimony last year that he did not learn of Israel's involvementuntil November, 1986.   Walsh received a copy of Wallach's memo just as he was preparingto put final touches on indictments likely to be returned in thecoming weeks against key participants in the arms sale to Iran anddiversion of proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels. Though Walsh'sstaff is eager to pursue the new lead, no delay is expected inthose indictments.   Charges are expected to be brought against former NationalSecurity Adviser John M. Poindexter, his former aide, Lt. Col.Oliver L. North, and two arms dealers, retired Air Force Maj. Gen.Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.</TEXT></DOC>
