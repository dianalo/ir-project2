He left behind three people dead or dying, three wounded and hisBelgian-made, 12-gauge sawed-off shotgun _ a trademark of anunderworld killing.   The next morning, at a gas station across town, a mob-linkedcontractor opened the door of his bulletproof car and died, alongwith his son-in-law, in bursts of submachine-gun and automatic riflefire.   The 'ndrangheta, the name for the Calabrian underworld, has madea killing field of the faded cities and towns in the rugged hillsand along the jagged coast of Italy's impoverished southern tip.   In the past year, 165 people have been murdered in the provinceof Reggio Calabria, at least 50 of them in this city across theStrait of Messina from Sicily. The death toll is staggering whencompared to just 31 killings in the province of Rome, which has apopulation of about 3.7 million, more than six times greater thanReggio Calabria's 589,000.   Investigators say most of the Calabrian dead fell victim to thestruggle for control of the drug trade or to a 25-year-old bloodfeud between two powerful crime families.   ``In certain zones of Sicily, Calabria and Campagna (Naples), thepossession of the territory by organized crime is total,'' DomenicoSica, Italy's high anti-Mafia commissioner, recently toldParliament's Anti-Mafia Commission.   The bosses of the 'ndrangheta, which means ``society of valorousmen,'' rule their Calabrian territories through fear andintimidation. Their retribution is swift and lethal. Often, life intheir domain is short and incredibly cheap.   One Rome-based investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity,said the average price for a hired killing in Calabria is $400.Free-lance hit men sometimes kill for free, hoping to curry favorwith a certain boss.   Drugs are at the core of the criminal empire that links the'ndrangheta with the Sicilian Mafia, Colombian cocaine kingpins andheroin warlords of Asia.   Experts estimate Italian crime bosses earn $10 billion to $12billion a year from the international heroin trade and that sales ofcocaine and other drugs may push the total above $20 billion.   The 'ndrangheta also profits from murders-for-hire, gunrunning,trading in counterfeit dollars, and kidnapping rings that collecthuge ransoms for quick reinvestment in drug deals.   Calabrian businesses must pay extortion to avoid the torch, andcorrupt politicians swell `ndrangheta coffers with millionsmisdirected from public works contracts, government developmentfunds and investment schemes designed to benefit Italy's blightedsouth.   To reassert control, the government proposes expanding the powersof police investigating organized crime and drug trafficking. Onemeasure would give police the authority to conduct undercoverinvestigations _ forbidden in a postwar Italy that remembers abusesunder the fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini.   In Rome, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents already arequietly training Italian authorities in undercover work.   Interior Minister Antonio Gava also has promised better trainingfor police, specialized departments, creation of mobile groups tohelp in trouble spots and new local commissioners to oversee the waron crime in Calabria.   This encourages Lt. Col. Corrado Borruso, commander of theCarabinieri paramilitary police in Reggio Di Calabria, who are onthe front line of the war with crime.   Borruso said he believes the government can defeat the`ndrangheta, that it can use expanded powers and undercoveroperations to go after the leaders and stop the killing.   ``It will be a struggle, really a long struggle,'' said Borruso.``We must seek to stop this slaughter through the arrest of the bigbosses who pull the strings of all the `ndrangheta operations.''   However, some other investigators question the political will ofthe government to do the things necessary to defeat organized crime.Billions of dollars in illicit profits bolster the clout of theMafia and 'ndrangheta, and some politicians owe their careers tovotes collected by the mob.   Privately some investigators admit they can't penetrate thetightknit clans of the 'ndrangheta and don't know enough about itsoperation.   For example, they know the Calabrians help smuggle tons ofmorphine base into Italy from southwest Asia, to refine it and tosell it in Europe and in the United States through contacts inToronto.   But they don't know the details of the partnership with theSicilians, who really control the drug market, or how much theCalabrians share in the profits.   Informers and hirelings willing to testify against theirCalabrian bosses are extremely rare.   ``He who is blind, deaf and dumb will live a hundred years,''advises an Italian proverb on the code of silence called the``Omerta'' or ``Diffidenza.''   The `ndrangheta has a long memory and a long reach. While Italy,laments the Rome-based investigator, has no effective witnessprotection program.   The government's enemy is also formidable in its sheer size.Police say there are 156 'ndrangheta clans in Calabria, 93 of themin the province of Reggio Calabria. Police records list slightlyover 4,000 members of the clans in Calabria. But investigators havesaid they believe that for everyone on the list there are at leasttwo who have escaped identification.   Police from all agencies in Calabria number about 3,600.   But Borruso and other investigators bristle at suggestions thatthey need more manpower, apparently considering such recommendationsa veiled slap at police effectiveness.   ``It is not only a question or a problem for the police,'' saidBorruso.   The government, he said, must change the things in Calabria thatpermit the `ndrangheta to flourish.   His sentiments are echoed by politicians, both nationally andlocally, who believe Italy can never defeat the `ndrangheta inCalabria, the Camorra in Campagna or the Mafia in Sicily as long asthe regions are allowed to languish in poverty.   Calabria ranks at the bottom of the list of per capita income byregion, with its citizens earning 44 percent less than the nationalaverage. Calabria's unemployment rate of 21.6 percent is nearlytwice the 11.9 percent for Italy as a whole and two and a half timesthe rate for the country's affluent north.   Calabria, like much of the rest of southern Italy, has notbenefited significantly from the industrial boom and the economicresurrgence that Italy contends has given it the West'sfifth-largest economy. Many of Calabria's factories sit idle. Itsports are largely empty. Much of its land is rocky, mountainous anduntilled.   ``In the absence of an adequate presence by the state, the'ndrangheta has penetrated into the vital nerve centers of theeconomy, politics and public administration,'' Calabria's regionalpresident, Rosario Olivio, said at a recent meeting with Sica, Gavaand anti-Mafia investigators.   ``The central problem is unemployment and around that turnseverything else,'' said Olivio.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Jan. 15</NOTE></DOC>
