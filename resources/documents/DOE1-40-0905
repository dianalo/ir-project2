In the elucidationof bacterial polysaccharides chemically based analytical procedures andinstrumental analytical techniques were used. Nuclear magnetic resonanceis a powerful tool for obtaining structural information on poly-, oligo-and di-saccharides and a detailed discussion of this technique, and theresults obtained in this study, is given.</TEXT></DOC>
