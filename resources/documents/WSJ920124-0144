What does a Minnesotan do during the summer? Do you meanbefore or after he shovels his walk?</LP><TEXT>   Why is Super Bowl XXVI in Minneapolis? Because all thehotels in Nome were booked for a dog-sled race.   So there; I have fulfilled my obligation to thesportswriters' union. Each of us who is here to cover theWashington Redskins-Buffalo Bills Super Bowl on Sunday isexpected to notice, and comment upon, the fact that frostyMinny is not Miami, Los Angeles or New Orleans, thewarm-to-warmish sites of most SBs past. It is the leastamount of observation one can expect of a journalist.   In further point of fact, though, Minneapolis isn't a badplace. It has a large, clean downtown, made up mostly of tallbuildings in which people work, and many pleasant, cleansuburbs to which they repair when the day is done. Itproduced popular liberal politicians when that model was invogue. You can get a good steak in a number of places and,I'm told, a decent plate of spaghetti if you know your wayaround. If you are from Fargo, N.D., you'll appreciate theshopping.   A rabid sports town Minneapolis is not. A friend of minewho makes the big-time sports scene tells of having sparetickets for a couple games in last October's baseball WorldSeries in Atlanta and here. When he made this known inAtlanta, he was besieged by mobs waving handfuls of $100bills. Here, the few people who expressed interest in hisducats studied them carefully for location and professeddismay at their face-value price of $45. He says he had towork hard to sell his for that amount.   &quot;This is not New York or Philadelphia; people here areshoppers first and fans second,&quot; confirms Dave Huffman, whohad an 11-season career as a Minnesota Viking offensivelineman and survived with enough wit to host a daily programon KFAN, the local all-sports radio station. &quot;Before theyspend their money to see a sporting event, they expect a goodseat and a reasonable expectation their team will win. I'msurprised they didn't ask your friend to guarantee theywouldn't be sitting behind someone who's extraordinarilytall.&quot;   But the Super Bowl wasn't awarded to Minneapolis on thebasis of a civic beauty contest, or as a reward for fanfervor. It is here because the National Football League, ofwhich the Vikings are a part, has a sizable contingent ofteams from Northern cities that might like to get their ownpiece of the game's economic action one day. Their ownerswant this so much they are willing to give up a January weekin the sun every decade or so to make their point.   The game also is here because Minneapolis has an indoorstadium in which to hold it; whatever the weather outsidehere may be on Sunday, the temperature in the Hubert H.Humphrey Metrodome will be 72 degrees, it will be dry, andthe artificial-turf field will look dandy on television. Inthis respect, Minny has an edge over Miami and L.A., whererain can spoil the NFL's parade.   The real point of this Super Bowl has to do with the warbetween sport and commerce, and I think it is worth makingeven though, in the NFL, it has long since been decided incommerce's favor. Its significant battles were as follows:the expansion of the league's schedule into the deep-wintermonths, the severance of the championship game from the homecities of the two participants, and the widespread adoptionof the artificial-turf playing field.   In the latter regard, the Metrodome's surface, like othersof its ilk, consists of half an inch of plastic overfive-eighths of an inch of padding on an asphalt base. That'slike throwing a carpet over a parking lot. &quot;Artificial turfis tough on every part of your body,&quot; notes Monte Coleman, aRedskins linebacker. &quot;It was not designed with the humanathlete in mind.&quot;   The indoor stadium has been the capstone of the process;it has turned football generally, and the Super Bowl inparticular, into an entrepreneur's dream -- a generic,controllable product that can be rolled out anyplace,anytime. Attendance is no problem; large football stadiumsare regularly filled in places like Fayetteville, Ark., andClemson, S.C., and television, the real patron, goesanywhere. Thus we have SB XXVI in January, in Minneapolis.   ---   OK, so now to the game. I don't want to bore you with myanalysis of the contestants' offenses and defenses, or offera treatise on the Redskins' vaunted &quot;counter-trey&quot; runningscheme. Similarly, I will refrain from spoiling youranticipation by telling you who will win.   Rather, I'll again let the participants speak forthemselves through the Klein Quote Quotient, which is basedon the proposition that the team that gets off the best HypeWeek quotes will prevail on the field. It has predicted theflat-out winner of six of the eight previous Bowls Super Ihave covered, and the point-spread victor seven times. Youcould look it up.   As in the past several of these affairs, there is noclear-cut winner of this year's KQQ. Both teams seem intenton depriving their foe of inflammatory bulletin-boardmaterial. Where is Jim McMahon when you need him?   A couple of Redskins have given good accounts ofthemselves. Matt Millen, a veteran linebacker, opined thathis club succeeds because it knows what to look for inplayers. &quot;We only hire guys like me -- handsome, elegant,articulate,&quot; he said. Joe Jacoby, the massive offensivetackle, said that while he appreciates the attention hisunit's &quot;Hogs&quot; nickname brings, he doubts the sanity of theWashingtonians who attend games wearing pig snouts. &quot;Thereally scary thing is that some of those people work for thegovernment,&quot; he cringed.   But Buffalo, a seven-point underdog, gets the nod on theefforts of an assistant coach, of all things. He's ChuckDickerson, a beefy gray-haired fellow who tutors the Bills'defensive linemen.   &quot;I can't speak for anybody else, but I'm takin' thesegames one at a time,&quot; Chuck growled on Tuesday. &quot;I'm gonnadance with the guys that brung me. I'm gonna coach to thebest of my abilities. I'm gonna give it 110%, try to make mycontribution, shoot for a career day. If we can't out-finesse'em, we'll out-gut 'em. Whatever it takes.&quot;   He paused for effect, then concluded, &quot;You people don'thave to do any more interviews now. I've said it all.&quot;   Reason enough to be grateful.</TEXT></DOC>
