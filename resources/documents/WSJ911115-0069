The university was ensnared in an embarrassing controversythis year after it was discovered to have billed thegovernment for wines, a yacht, and luxury furnishings to theuniversity president's mansion. Indirect costs of researchnormally refer to such items as the maintenance of librariesand laboratories where scholarly research is conducted.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;At issue are fundamental matters of fairness,&quot; said PeterVan Etten, the university's chief financial officer. Theadministrative appeal filed yesterday asks the Armed ServicesBoard of Contract Appeals to award Stanford all of its&quot;actual, legitimate indirect costs,&quot; rather than the 55.5%rate imposed by the Office of Naval Research.   Stanford has already withdrawn $2.3 million ofinappropriate charges, and said it is &quot;scrubbing its books&quot;in a process of accounting reform. Stanford President DonaldKennedy recently relinquished his post because of lingeringeffects of the scandal.   Currently at issue are certain memorandums ofunderstanding between the university and the government.Critics have sought to portray the memorandums as &quot;cozydeals,&quot; rather than as bona fide contracts for handlingresearch costs. Stanford failed to reach agreement with theOffice of Naval Research, Mr. Van Etten said, and undertookthe appeal &quot;only as a last resort.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
