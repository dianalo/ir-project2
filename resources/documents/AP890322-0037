(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A retired librarian who thinks it's nevertoo late to turn the page on an embarrassing event in his family'spast has returned three library books nearly 75 years after hismother checked them out.   Edward MacConomy Jr., of Virginia, said he wanted to clear thefamily name by returning the books to the Jackson Public Library.   The books now have cracking bindings and fragile pages. LibraryDirector David L. Leamon said they are the longest overdue bookshe's ever seen returned. Library officials decided not to fineMacConomy.   ``It's nice to know that guilt is still alive and well. Imagine,still interested in clearing the family name after all theseyears,'' Leamon said. ``He could have just tossed those books intothe trash, but instead, he took the time to add a little humor toour day.''   MacConony, 72, worked at the Library of Congress in Washington,D.C., from 1963 until his retirement in 1985. He lives inAlexandria, Va.   In a letter to the Jackson District Library dated Feb. 21, hesaid his mother, Frances, must have inadvertently taken the threebooks when she moved from Jackson to Detroit in 1914 after shemarried.   ``When she died in 1974, the contents of her library were justsort of boxed up and put to one side,'' MacConomy said of hismother. ``It doesn't seem very logical, but I never got to thematerial to do anything with it or about it until just a few weeksago.   ``I thought well, they don't belong to her and they don't belongto me _ I better send them back.''   The books were Sir Walter Scott's ``Quentin Durward,'' KateDouglas Wiggin's ``The Birds' Xmas Carol'' and Louisa May Alcott's``Jo's Boys.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WEIRTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 25-year-old municipal judge who claims tobe the youngest jurist in the country says his recent appointment tothe bench is only fitting for someone who's always wanted to makethe law his life.   ``Even when I was young, I just always had it in my mind that Iwanted to be an attorney,'' said Vince Gurrera.   ``When you fill out those little forms, `What do you want to bewhen you grow up?' I always put `attorney.' If you look at myfourth-grade one ... `attorney.'   The 1987 graduate of West Virginia University's College of Lawwas appointed to the bench recently by Weirton Mayor Edwin Bowman tofill a vacancy.   ``I guess what influenced me most in wanting to go into the legalprofession was ... watching television shows that deal withlawyers,'' Gurrera said, adding that one of his favorite shows was``Perry Mason.''   Another influence was an early brush with the law, he said.   ``Probably when I was five years old, I tried to steal a deck ofcards from Kroger. I was with my grandmother,'' the judge said. ``Igave the cards to the clerk and she let me go.   ``It embarrassed me, though,'' Gurrera said. ``Ever since then,I've taken a real hard stand against shoplifting.''</TEXT></DOC>
