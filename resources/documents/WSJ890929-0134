In a statement, the company said that under the agreement, which is subject to approval by the boards of all three companies and Britain's Department of Energy, first production from the field should begin in 1993.    Under the agreement, the design and construction of the field's facilities will be the responsibility of Shell U.K. Exploration andamp; Production, the joint-venture operator for Shell and Exxon's Esso U.K. PLC unit in the North Sea.    Enterprise is the designated field operator for the production phase and will take over operatorship at first oil, the statement said.    The field straddles two blocks, 22/11 which is licensed to Enterprise, and 22/6a, for which Shell and Esso hold the license. The field has recoverable reserves in excess of 300 million barrels of oil and 100 billion cubic feet of gas and is about six miles southeast of the large Forties field operated by British Petroleum Co. </TEXT></DOC>
