The mattersunder consideration will not result in: (1) An annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more, (2) a major increase in costs for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local governments, or geographical regions,or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, the environment or the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program that this noticeapplies to are: Title_Commodity Loan and Purchases, Number_10.051, as setforth in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicableto this notice since the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service(ASCS) is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any provision of law to publisha notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of thisnotice.This activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.See the Notice related to CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, published at 48 FR29115 (June 24, 1983).In accordance with section 312 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938,as amended (the Act), the Secretary of Agriculture is require to proclaimmarketing quotas for cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco. In accordance withthis Act, it is not possible to proclaim a national marketing quota greaterthan zero. Accordingly, no other option may be considered with respectto the proclamation of such quota for the 1989-90 marketing year. According,no Regulatory Impact Analysis will be prepared.Section 312(a) of the Act provides that the Secretary shall, not laterthan March 1 of any marketing year with respect to this kind of tobacco,proclaim a national marketing quota for each of the next three succeedingmarketing years whenever the Secretary determines with respect to suchkind of tobacco that the total supply of tobacco exceeds the reserve supplylevel.Section 301(b) of the Act defines the ``total supply'' of cigar-filler(type 46) tobacco as the carryover at the beginning of the current marketingyear (October 1, 1988) plus the estimated 1988 production in the UnitedStates. Therefore, the total supply of cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco forthe 1988-89 marketing year is 4.4 million pounds based on beginning stocksof 4.2 million pounds and 1988 production of 0.2 million pounds.Since the total supply of cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco exceeds the reservesupply level, the Secretary of Agriculture must, by March 1, 1989, proclaimnational marketing quotas for the 1989-90, 1990-91, and 1991-92 marketingyears and determine and announce the amount of the national marketing quotawhich would be in effect for the 1989-90 marketing year for this kind oftobacco.In addition, the Secretary is required to conduct, within 30 days afterthe proclamation of such national marketing quotas, a referendum of farmersengaged in the 1988 production of such kind of tobacco in order to determinewhether they favor or oppose marketing quotas for such years.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions</ITAG>Section 301(c) of the Act defines the reserve supply level as the normalsupply plus 5 percent thereof. The normal supply is defined as a normalyear's domestic consumption and exports, plus 175 percent of a normal year'sdomestic consumption plus 65 percent of a normal year's exports. A normalyear's domestic consumption is defined as the yearly average quantity producedin the United States and consumed in the United States during the 10 marketingyears immediately preceding the marketing year in which such consumptionis determined, adjusted for current trends in such consumption. A normalyear's exports is defined as the average quantity produced in and exportedfrom the United States during the 10 marketing years immediately precedingthe marketing year in which such exports are determined, adjusted for currenttrends in such exports.The yearly average quantity of cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco producedin the United States which is estimated to have been consumed in the UnitedStates during the 10 marketing years preceding the 1988-89 marketing yearwas approximately 1.2 million pounds. None was exported during this time.Domestic use has shown a downward trend. Accordingly, a normal year's domesticconsumption has been set at 0.7 million pounds while a normal year's exportshave been set at 0.0 million pounds. Application of the formula prescribedby section 301(b)(14)(B) of the Act results in a reserve supply level of2.0 million pounds.Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of cigar-filler (type 46) tobaccoheld on October 1, 1988, of 4.2 million pounds. The 1988 cigar-filler (type46) tobacco crop is estimated to be 0.2 million pounds. Therefore, thetotal supply of cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco for the 1988-89 marketingyear is 4.4 million pounds. During the 1988-89 marketing year, it is estimatedthat disappearance will total approximately 0.7 million pounds. By deductingthis disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 3.7 million poundsat the beginning of the 1989-90 marketing year is obtained.The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryoveron October 1, 1989 is ^1.7 million pounds. Because the estimated carryoverat the beginning of the 1989-90 marketing year exceeds the reserve supplylevel, the quantity of cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco which may be marketedduring the 1989-90 marketing year is zero.In accordance with section 313(g) of the Act, the 1989-90 national marketingquota for cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco is zero. Accordingly, the nationalacreage allotment for such tobacco is zero.Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the Act, the national acreagefactor is 0.00. <ITAG tagnum="84">Determinations </ITAG>Proclamation of National Marketing Quotas for Cigar-Filler (Type 46) Tobacco<ITAG tagnum="21">Because the total supply for the 1988-89 marketing year exceeds thereserve stock level, a national marketing quota for such kind of tobaccofor each of the three marketing years, beginning October 1, 1989, October1, 1990, and October 1, 1991, is hereby proclaimed. </ITAG>Determinations 1989-90 Marketing Year For cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco for the marketing year beginning October1, 1989: (a) <T3>Reserve supply level. </T3>The reserve supply level for cigar-filler(type 46) tobacco for the 1988-89 marketing year is 2.0 million pounds.(b) <T3>Total supply. </T3>The total supply of cigar-filler (type 46) tobaccofor the marketing year beginning October 1, 1988, is 4.4 million pounds.(c) <T3>Carryover. </T3>The estimated carryover of cigar-filler (type 46) tobaccofor the marketing year beginning October 1, 1989, is 3.7 million pounds.(d) <T3>National marketing quota. </T3>Because the estimated carryover at thebeginning of the 1989-90 marketing year exceeds the reserve supply level,the quantity of cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco which may be marketed duringthe 1989-90 marketing year is zero.
