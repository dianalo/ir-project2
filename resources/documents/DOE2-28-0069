To overcome this problemin the past the solution for a thick slab has been used instead of thatfor a single surface. It is shown that a simpler method valid for a singlesurface is to insist that only Bloch waves with current flow into orparallel to the crystal surface are allowed. Because of the equationsof continuity, this is identical to insisting that only decaying wavesare excited in the crystal. An additional feature of this simpler methodis that the allowed Bloch waves can be readily represented on a dispersion-surfaceconstruction.</TEXT></DOC>
