The marketing concern achieved strong growth despite newfederal excise taxes that led to increased beer and tobaccoprices at the retail level, and a recent acquisition thatdiluted per-share earnings.</LP><TEXT>   Philip Morris also had to contend with a rush bywholesalers to load up on the company's cheaper cigarettes,at the expense of its full-price brands, before a steep priceincrease in March. Thus, while domestic tobacco marginsincreased, the rise was the smallest in some time, analystssaid.   With most of those factors now behind the company, someanalysts expect Philip Morris to turn in even higher profitgrowth. &quot;A concentration of factors caused the first quarterto be more difficult for Philip Morris than should be thecase in upcoming quarters,&quot; said Marc Cohen of Sanford C.Bernstein and Co.; he expects full-year earnings to rise 25%.   First-quarter net increased to $942 million, or $1.02 ashare, from $775 million, or 84 cents a share, a year ago.Revenue rose 25% to $14.22 billion from $11.39 billion.   Divergent reaction to Philip Morris's earnings sparkedheavy trading with over three million shares changing handsin composite trading yesterday on the New York StockExchange. The common closed at $70.625, off $1. Someinvestors focused on the company's strong results in arecessionary climate, while others took a dimmer view aboutthe long-term implications of the growth of its discountcigarette brands.   In its U.S. cigarette business, Philip Morris's operatingprofit rose 12% to $914 million. The company's volumes grew1% overall, as volume of the company's full-price brands fell7% and unit sales of cheaper cigarettes soared more than 50%in the quarter.   Operating profit in the international tobacco business --the crown jewel in Philip Morris's tobacco trade -- grew 33%to $509 million, while volume grew 24% as the company gainedshare in all major markets and made inroads in new ones,notably in eastern Germany, Poland and the Soviet Union.   In Philip Morris's food business, which comprised 52% ofthe company's total revenue but only 32% of operating profit,earnings rose 25% to $742 million. That was helped by theacquisition in October of Jacob Suchard AG, a European coffeecompany, and by improved results at General Foods.   Separately, American Brands Inc. reported thatfirst-quarter profit rose 11% to a record $217 million, or$1.06 a share, from $195 million, or $1 a share, a yearearlier. Revenue rose 20% to $3.9 billion from $3.2 billion.But some analysts predicted the performance of the OldGreenwich, Conn., tobacco, liquor and insurance concern willworsen in subsequent quarters.   &quot;In contrast to Philip Morris, they face more difficultconditions going forward, particularly in their internationaltobacco business,&quot; said Sanford C. Bernstein's Mr. Cohen. Henoted that the company's overseas tobacco business isconcentrated in England, where a sharp excise tax wasimplemented in March. In addition, the company is expected toexperience negative effects of currency translations incoming quarters.   But William J. Alley, American Brands' chairman and chiefexecutive officer, said that the company will have a recordyear in 1991, &quot;despite soft economic conditions in ourprincipal geographic markets and the impact of higher taxesin the U.K.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
