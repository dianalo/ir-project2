Patient groups included lymphoma(36), infarct (28), leukemia (14), abscess (13), cyst (18), metastaticcancer (six), hemangioma (four), hematoma (four), and hamartoma (one).In no case were clinical findings alone sufficient to diagnose a spleniclesion. Clinical and laboratory manifestations were nonspecific in allgroups. Moreover, no radiologic study reliably diagnosed splenic lymphomaor leukemia. All other focal splenic lesions were consistently diagnosednoninvasively. Cross-sectional imaging was more useful than radioisotopeimaging and often provided adjunctive diagnosis of extrasplenic pathology.The superior detail, spatial resolution, and sensitivity of CT made itthe single most valuable diagnostic modality.</TEXT></DOC>
