U.S. District Judge Clarence Brimmer in Cheyenne, Wyo., yesterday entered an order affirming the amount, which he earlier had reduced from the $549 million a jury awarded the Colorado Interstate Gas Co. unit of Coastal.    Entry of the order followed Coastal's decision not to contest the reduction; Houston-based Coastal would have faced the risk of a new trial had it contested.    Occidental, which has interests in natural resources, chemicals and food processing, said it is &quot;convinced that there isn't any legal merit&quot; to the case against Natural Gas Pipeline Co., a unit of MidCon Corp., which Occidental acquired early last year.    The largest part of the award, $344 million, was for antitrust violations alleged against Natural Gas Pipeline.    Last October, the jury found the Occidental unit had broken a contract to buy gas from the Coastal unit as part of an attempt to achieve a natural-gas marketing monopoly in parts of the West and upper Midwest.    In a statement, Occidental said it would file with the Denver-based 10th Circuit Court of Appeals for a review of the district court ruling. Occidental said the circuit court, in a previous ruling, had &quot;rendered unenforceable the anti-competitive provision in the contract&quot; between Colorado Interstate and Natural Gas Pipeline.    &quot;We are pleased with the court's ruling and confident that it will be upheld on appeal,&quot; said James R. Paul, Coastal's president and chief operating officer, said in Houston.    Coastal noted interest on the award is accruing at $65,000 a day and already has reached more than $13.5 million. </TEXT></DOC>
