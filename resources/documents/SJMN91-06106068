The national economy is in woeful shape, and you might thinkSilicon Valley's corporate giants would be dragged down with it. But theopposite is true.;    Many companies are faring surprisingly well -- in fact,many prominent members of the Silicon Valley 100 are facing their brightestprospects in years.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE SILICON VALLEY 100HOW THE AREA'S TOP COMPANIES COMPAREBIG PLAYERS SHOULDER ASIDE RECESSION'S WOES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Silicon Valley 100Special IssueSee also related stories on pages 1F andamp; 7F-10F in this section  </MEMO><TEXT>     They're reaping more sales from overseas and convincing U.S. customers thatit makes sense to buy equipment to boost productivity even in a recession.They're also introducing important products at a vigorous pace, whichstimulates considerable demand.;    Take Hewlett-Packard Co., the Palo Altocomputer and instrumentation giant that perennially ranks No. 1 on the 100list.;    It has streamlined by eliminating thousands of jobs, reorganized asloppy sales and marketing organization and introduced a lightning-fast workstation and other hot new products. As a result, analysts say, H-P is easilyin the best position among the industry's biggest players.;    Apple ComputerInc., meanwhile, has been strengthened by the enormously successfulintroduction of lower-priced machines, and more gains are expected after thecompany introduces smaller and lighter portables later this year and thenexpands further into the consumer market with machines that are cheaperstill.;    Semiconductor giant Intel Corp. faces more competition than usualfrom the likes of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which has introduced a highlycompetitive 80386-compatible microprocessor, and from a high-powered computerindustry consortium that has its eye on a different microprocessortechnology.;    Still, Intel is racing ahead with plans to invest $600 millionin research and development this year and up to $1 billion in new plant andequipment, and most analysts say they believe it will remain the semiconductorcompany to beat for years to come.;    Other big companies are prospering,too. Sun Microsystems Inc. retains its dominant position in the fast-growingtechnical computer work-station market and is making major inroads in thecommercial arena. Seagate Technology is harvesting the benefits of its October1989 acquisition of Imprimis Technology Inc., becoming a far more diversifiedmaker of high-quality, leading-edge disk drives.;    Amdahl Corp., theSunnyvale mainframe computer maker, is having a sluggish year, but it'sexpected to rebound sharply with the introduction of a new generation ofmainframes late in 1991. Even Oracle Systems Corp., the big Redwood Citydata-base software company, is finally displaying signs of a turnaround aftera string of disappointing quarters.;    Not all of Silicon Valley's bigcompanies have been immune to the state of the economy or huge strategicmistakes.;    Consolidated Freightways, the Menlo Park-based freight giant andthe area's biggest non-electronics company, remains bogged down by itsdisastrous $478 million acquisition in 1989 of Emery Air Freight Corp.Businessland Inc., the nation's biggest purveyor of personal computers andrelated gear and once one of Silicon Valley's most promising companies,persistently has failed to react effectively to changes in personal computerdistribution.;    Tandem Computers Inc. isn't in nearly as bad shape as thesecompanies. But its growth has slowed to a virtual halt as financial problemshave plagued the banking industry and other core Tandem markets and as morecompetitors mimic the features of its machines. Tandem's mainframe-classCyclone computer also has had minimal success wooing customers away fromInternational Business Machines Corp.;    Nonetheless, the overall picture isvery bright. Here is a look at the developments and prospects at some of thedominant companies on the Silicon Valley 100:; 1. HEWLETT-PACKARD;  H-P'sprospects are especially rosy in contrast to fellow industry giants IBM,Digital Equipment Corp. and Unisys Corp., all of which continue to struggle.;    A year ago, things didn't look good at H-P, either. The company'sacquisition of work-station maker Apollo Computer Corp. initially was viewedas a flop, and analysts were concerned about H-P's heavy dependence onminicomputers, one of the slowest growth segments in computing. But today, thecompany's work-station business suddenly looks highly promising, andminicomputer sales are faring better than expected.;    &quot;Of all the companiesin the Silicon Valley 100, Hewlett-Packard has done the most to turn itselfaround,&quot; says Robert Herwick, a senior technology analyst at Hambrecht andamp; QuistInc.;    H-P's new work stations, which flowed out of the Apollo acquisition,offer the power of machines selling for nearly 10 times as much. Just asimportant, they are the first family of work stations highly competitive inprice. The work stations complement H-P's ongoing strength in laser printers-- the company has nearly 60 percent of that $3.6 billion market -- and inpersonal computers and minicomputers, which benefit from an innovativelystreamlined architecture.;    Hot products aren't the whole story behind H-P'ssuccess. The company's sales and marketing organization has been tightened toeliminate costly redundancies, and it has become much more aggressive.;    Forthe first time, H-P advertisements make direct comparisons between H-Pcomputers and competing brands. The company also is making important stridesas an integrator of computer systems made by a variety of manufacturers.;   &quot;This means H-P can do a lot of business with companies that aren't justcommitted to Hewlett-Packard equipment,&quot; says Michael Murphy, editor of theCalifornia Technology Stock Letter.; 2. APPLE; Users of the Apple Macintoshhave raved about the machines for years, but they had always been members of arelatively exclusive club.;     Until last fall, the lowest-priced Mac costnearly $1,500, and most were substantially more. But then came the $1,000Macintosh Classic and the $2,000 Macintosh LC, a color machine, and demandexploded.;    &quot;Even Apple has been astounded by how many Classics are goingout the door,&quot; says Tim Bajarin, executive vice president of CreativeStrategies International, a Santa Clara high-tech market research firm. &quot;Appleis in a better position than ever.&quot;;    Apple, which last fiscal year garneredsales of nearly $5.6 billion, is projected to approach $7 billion this year.Besides the low-priced computers and the pending introduction of lighterportables, analysts say Apple's growth will be sparked by an all-out assaulton the home market. Some say they believe that Apple will sell a Nintendo-likevideo game player in the likes of Toys R Us, which would allow the company tosell a computer that uses the television for its monitor, pushing the pricedown to roughly $500.;    All of this is said to be part of an internal Applecampaign -- dubbed Macintosh 30 -- to triple the market share of Applecomputers.;    Another strategic move will embrace streamlined reducedinstruction-set computing, or RISC, microprocessors to boost performance atthe high end of the product line, and Apple is even considering the risky stepof developing Macintosh software to run on IBM-compatible computers. Thelatter idea may be discarded, but analysts nonetheless say they expect steadygains in Apple market share.;    &quot;What we have seen so far is just the tip ofthe iceberg,&quot; says Rick Martin, a computer industry analyst at PrudentialBache Securities in New York.; 15. AMD;  AMD, which hasn't been ranked in theTop 10 of the Silicon Valley 100 since 1987, may be poised to climb back up tothe top tier.;     The new AM386 is drawing raves -- and orders. Analystsestimate that the company shipped 36,500 of the microprocessors in the firstquarter and project shipments of nearly 200,000 this quarter. And withsubstantial reductions in workforce and in manufacturing facilities -- AMD hasconsolidated virtually all of its production around Austin, Texas -- thecompany is in a position to grow off a highly cost-efficient base.;    Justhow high AMD can rebound is a matter of debate. VLSI Research's Dan Hutchinsonfigures the company's 80386 clone will fuel growth for about two years butthen peter out.;    &quot;AMD still has a limited product line, and it doesn't havethe marketing prowess it once did,&quot; he says. &quot;As important as it is, even the386 is a 'me, too' product. AMD still has big weaknesses.&quot;;    More upbeat isthe California Technology Stock Letter's Murphy, who says he believes thatAMD's 386 clone will spur the company's growth far longer than two years andbe followed by a clone of Intel's 80486 chip and successive generations,regardless of the outcome of legal wrangling.;    This will give AMDtremendous cash flow to reinvest in new product development, Murphy says. Andthe company already has at least two other substantial product lines --programmable array logic chips used in personal computers and auto electronicsand a streamlined RISC controller used in printers, cars and industrialmachinery.;    &quot;The Intel clone business alone could easily make AMD a $1.5billion company within a few years,&quot; Murphy says. &quot;The company has a very goodshot at getting back into the Top 10.&quot;; 5. SUN MICROSYSTEMs;  In some circles,the creation last week of a coalition of 21 computer companies that endorsed anew computer standard was viewed as bad news for the hotshot Mountain Viewwork-station maker.;     The standard, based on RISC architecture, competeshead-to-head with Sun, and the consortium includes the likes of CompaqComputer Corp. and Digital. Such companies' sales and distribution musclealone seems to pose a threat.;    &quot;This has to hurt Sun in the long term,&quot;says Sandy Gant, a vice president at Infocorp, a Santa Clara high-tech marketresearch firm.;    But this is a distinctly minority view. Most Sun observerssay the company, which is poised to crack $3 billion in sales this year, hasbuilt up too much momentum to be slowed. Sun is making big inroads in thehighly lucrative commercial arena, now 15 percent of its business, and stillhas enormous growth potential in its mainstay technical computing market.;   &quot;Performance-oriented customers who want 'open' systems and a more capablenetworking environment tend to be natural customers for Sun,&quot; says Hambrecht andamp;Quist's Herwick. &quot;Sun delivers this better than anybody else.&quot;;    Sun hasabout 30 percent of the pie in work stations. By the time the consortiumbegins shipping products designed around a new Mips Computer Systems Inc.microprocessor -- perhaps up to two years from now -- Sun and companieslicensed to sell Sun-like systems will have up to 40 percent of the market,analysts say.;    &quot;By then, it may be too late for the consortium to have anyimpact,&quot; says David Burdick, a computer industry analyst at Dataquest Inc.;   Even if the consortium fares well, Burdick says he doesn't think it will havea significant impact on Sun.;    &quot;As long as work-station makers keep cuttingprices and boosting performance as much as they have, customers will continueto replace old machines with new machines,&quot; Burdick says.; 6. SEAGATE; SeagateTechnology, the world's biggest independent maker of disk drives, is on a rollfor the first time in years, and its acquisition of Imprimis, a formersubsidiary of Control Data Corp., gets almost all the credit. The acquisitiondiversified Seagate's product offerings.;     More important, analysts say,Seagate got religion from Imprimis, kindling a drive to produce superior, moreleading-edge drives and to conduct more business directly with manufacturersrather than primarily with computer users.;    The Comdex show in Las Vegaslast November told much of the story.;    Seagate announced the development ofabout 20 new products -- 10 times the normal number. They included jointdevelopment accords with NCR Corp. for highly sophisticated &quot;disk arrays&quot; andwith Cray Research Inc. for high-performance disk drives for supercomputers.Seagate also announced its entry into the important 2 1/2-inch disk-drivemarket for use in portable computers.;    &quot;Seagate used to focus onentry-level products for the mass market,&quot; says Philip Devin, a computerstorage analyst at Dataquest Inc. &quot;Now it has clearly shown that it's movinginto higher-performance and more reliable leading-edge products.&quot;;    Devinsays Seagate is well-positioned to become a $4 billion company by middecadeand perhaps bolt high into the Top 10. Jim Porter, president of Disk/TrendInc., a Mountain View disk-drive industry research firm, is more cautious.;   &quot;Seagate still has to beat Quantum Corp. and Conner Peripherals, and thatwon't be easy,&quot; he says about two other leading disk-drive companies.&quot;Competitors in the disk-drive industry are on a tough, never-endingtreadmill.&quot;; 7. AMDAHL;  This is shaping up as a tough year for Amdahl, butthat was to be expected.;    Amdahl, the premier alternative supplier forIBM-compatible mainframes, isn't quite ready to launch its next generation ofmainframes, and it almost always fares poorly in the last year of an agingproduct cycle. New machines will be introduced in the fourth quarter, analystssay, and Amdahl will ride a rising wave of revenues in 1992 and 1993.;   There is some debate about Amdahl's prospects. Neil Weintraut, a computerindustry analyst at Hambrecht andamp; Quist, says Amdahl will grow only 10 percentto 15 percent in coming years, sharply below the growth rate of peak years inthe 1980s.;    &quot;There won't be that much growth in the mainframe marketbecause it has become primarily a replacement business,&quot; Weintraut says.;   But Prudential Bache's Martin disagrees sharply. Conventional wisdom thatmainframe growth is stagnating is a myth, he says. And Amdahl grabs a coupleof extra points of market share in every new product cycle, Martin says, ascustomers become more comfortable with the company's growing size andreputation.;    Look for Amdahl's revenues to grow about 30 percent next year.&quot;Amdahl has a tremendous future,&quot; Martin says.; 16. ORACLE;  Oracle has longhad a commanding share of the so-called relational data-base software marketfor big computers, but sloppy sales practices and accounting controls finallysnagged the company in the past year.;    More recently, though, signs haveemerged that this hypergrowth company is cleaning up its act.;    &quot;Things aregetting better at Oracle, not worse,&quot; says David Bayer, a software industryanalyst at Montgomery Securities.;    Oracle has been trimming expenses andjust announced the adoption of more stringent accounting practices. Lastquarter, it produced its first positive cash flow in nearly a year. A growingnumber of analysts advise investors to buy the company's stock, although theycaution that the company has yet to complete its fix-up.;    One stickingpoint is that Oracle remains in violation on covenants covering $184 millionin outstanding loans from a consortium of banks.;    Nonetheless, Oracleremains in better shape than many of its faltering competitors, and mostobservers say they believe it will complete its turnaround before year-end.;   &quot;Oracle's easy sales might be over,&quot; says Charles Phillips, a softwareindustry analyst at Soundview Financial Group in Stamford, Conn. &quot;But if youlook at where most corporate reservoirs of information are still sitting, theyare in older data bases, not relational bases, and that plays to Oracle'sstrength.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  STEVE KAUFMAN, Business Monday Editor  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910415  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  2,487  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 15, 199100106068,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
