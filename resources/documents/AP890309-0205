But civil libertarians say the Ohio case and five similar onesaround the nation represent an intrusion by ``Big Brother'' on therights of women.   ``It indicates a real trend to me,'' said Diana Traub, publiceducation officer for the American Civil Liberties Union'sReproductive Freedom Project in New York. ``There's a real danger ofsetting bad precedent here.''   She cited cases, mostly involving alleged drug abuse by expectantmothers, in California, Florida, Michigan, New York, Nevada,Washington, D.C., and Ohio.   In the Ohio case, Franklin County Juvenile Court Judge CharlesPetree II ruled last September that a fetus carried by a cocaine-andmorphine-dependent woman was a person and, therefore, subject tocourt jurisdiction.   He ordered that Janet Cox, 27, seek prenatal care and stop takingdrugs.   Petree's ruling was overturned in December by the 10th OhioDistrict Court of Appeals shortly after she gave birth to her fifthchild, Steven, who was drug-free.   One of her four other sons was born drug-dependent, and she haslost custody of all of them, including Steven. She has filed fordivorce from her husband of eight years, David, who underwentemergency hospitalization for drug abuse in December.   Some civil-rights advocates say the state has overstepped itsauthority in Mrs. Cox's case.   Elinor Alger, acting legal director of the ACLU in Columbus,called the attempt to take jurisdiction over Mrs. Cox's fetus ``alocal manifestation of a national movement to take control of awoman's right to decide for herself how she treats her own body.''   ``The judge in this case was particularly anxious to takejurisdiction over this fetus. I would not be at all surprised ifthis issue comes up again and again,'' she said.   Janet Folger, legislative director of Right To Life-Ohio, scoffedat defending women who use illegal drugs while pregnant.   ``This is something illegal the woman is doing, and the argumentby abortion proponents who defend a woman saying this is some kindof constitutionally guaranteed right is ludicrous,'' she said.   ``I think there is a small trend because it's evident that thereis a second victim here,'' she said. ``I think the public is finallyrecognizing that a fetus is a person whose place of residencehappens to be the womb.''   No Ohio law protects fetuses in such cases, and James Zorn, anassistant Franklin County prosecutor, added: ``The court of appealssaid we did not have jurisdiction over a fetus. That means we can'tpursue a case based on a mother's prenatal drug use.   ``But that doesn't mean we can't and won't monitor it afterbirth.''   Mrs. Cox is serving a one-year jail term for violating terms ofprobation _ prosecutors contend she failed 40 drug-screening tests _following her 1987 conviction in a prescription forgery case.   Thomas Shanahan, the attorney for Mrs. Cox, said authoritiesshould spend their time and money helping low-income, jobless,pregnant women such as Mrs. Cox overcome their drug dependencyrather than waging expensive legal battles.   ``They were looking for a test case and they picked her. All theyhave succeeded in doing in locking up a woman who has a drugproblem,'' he said.   Shanahan also believes the trend is discriminatory.   ``You don't see them regulating the conduct of fathers. What ifhe smokes too close to his pregnant wife ... ? Do you see anyonegoing after him?'' he said.   ``It is the Big Brother scenario all over again,'' said Ms.Traub. ``Nobody wants to see a baby born hooked on drugs, butpenalizing a woman who takes drugs because she has the audacity toget pregnant is simply punitive.   ``Could this also be extended to all women in their reproductiveyears? Believe it. They could be prohibited from doing anything acourt determined to be bad for them, including drinking or smoking.''   Zorn insists, ``Nobody's trying to play Big Brother.   ``The sole concern here is the best interest of the child,'' hesaid. ``Is it in the best interest of a child to allow its mother toinjure that child?   ``Nobody's going to go after a woman because she drinks andsmokes. The main difference here is that Mrs. Cox was engaged in anillegal activity _ taking drugs.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday PMs, March 13</NOTE></DOC>
