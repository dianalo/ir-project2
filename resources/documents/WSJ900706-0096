The stock portfolios of investment managers gained anaverage of 3.1% in the first six months of this year,according to performance figures compiled by CDA InvestmentTechnologies Inc., Rockville, Md. Before subtracting fees,the first-half results were a tad ahead of the 3% gain forthe overall market as measured by the Standard andamp; Poor's500-stock index.</LP><TEXT>   All of the first-half gains came in the second quarter;the average manager's portfolio sustained a loss of 3.2% inthe first quarter, according to CDA's calculations. The Sandamp;Pindex fell 3% in the first three months.   For the 12 months ended June 30, stock managers posted again of 13.7%, according to CDA's calculations, compared with16.4% for the Sandamp;P 500.   Extending a trend begun last year, growth and small-stockmanagers have taken the spotlight in the recent performancerankings, far outshining investment advisers who favor thebig stocks that dominate the Sandamp;P 500. The run-up in bigstocks began to flag last year, when both the takeover boomand earnings increases among the large-capitalization issuesstarted to turn soft.   Says growth-stock manager John Sullivan: &quot;Since mid-1989,it has been a growth-stock market, and we have been in theright pew.&quot; He's a partner in Harris, Bretall, Sullivan andamp;Smith in San Francisco, which was one of the top-performingmoney-management firms in the first half.   Mr. Sullivan, whose firm manages about $350 million ofstocks, says he and his partners have had little troublecoming up with a portfolio of 40 well-known stocks, each withearnings growing in the area of 20% a year. The firm makesbig bets on stock groups it thinks will do well, even at theexpense of diversity.   So Harris Bretall has 32% of its portfolio in technologystocks such as Compaq Computer Corp., Automatic DataProcessing Inc., Intel Corp., Motorola Inc., Novell Inc.,Oracle Systems Corp. and Microsoft Inc. It also considersAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. a technology holding.   Another 30% of the portfolio consists of a hodgepodge ofcapital equipment, environmental and other industrialconcerns. Here the firm likes Browning-Ferris IndustriesInc., Waste Management Inc. and even one aerospace maker,Boeing Co. In the drug area, with a 15% allocation, holdingsinclude Merck andamp; Co., Upjohn Co., Abbott Laboratories and St.Jude Medical Inc.   Harris Bretall has stayed fully invested in stocks and,despite skeptics, thinks the corporate earnings picture isgetting brighter. &quot;I suspect you're seeing the trough inearnings,&quot; says Mr. Sullivan. &quot;They're going to look betterin the third and fourth quarters and into 1991,&quot; he says.   Provident Investment Counsel, Pasadena, Calif., anothertop-performing growth manager with about $3.6 billion instocks under management, says companies with strong earningsmomentum could benefit even in a softening economy. &quot;In thatkind of an environment, {investment} money seeks a place thatit can count on as a haven,&quot; bolstering growth stocks, saysRobert Kommerstad, Provident's chairman.   Among Provident's strong performers are Walt Disney Co.,Reuters PLC, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp. andthat favorite growth stock, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (&quot;You musthave heard that 1,000 times from growth managers,&quot; Mr.Kommerstad says of Wal-Mart.) Software makers Microsoft Corp.and Autodesk Inc. also are favorites.   The turnaround in growth stocks is helping growth managersland much of the new money entering the stock market, hesays. &quot;You're starting to see a seminar here and there ongrowth-stock investing,&quot; according to Mr. Kommerstad. &quot;Youhaven't seen that for years.&quot;   George Yeager, head of New York-based Yeager, Wood andamp;Marshall, another top-performing growth manager with nearly$500 million in assets, says strong growth issues such asWal-Mart, Coca-Cola Co., McDonald's Corp. and Disney &quot;are notdependent on the business cycle&quot; for much of theirperformance.   Mr. Yeager says the stocks he holds carry a price-earningsmultiple 1.3 times that of the stocks in the Sandamp;P 500 index.But their earnings are growing four times as fast as the Sandamp;Pstocks. &quot;That's just about the best trade-off in ourprofessional experience, and it's going to be good for quitesome time,&quot; he says.   Some managers specializing in small stocks also did wellin the first half.   Amerindo U.S. Advisors Inc. of Larkspur, Calif., whichbuys nothing but electronic and biotechnology stocks at theirinitial public offerings and sells them when they reachannual sales of $300 million, topped the list of managersduring the period, as it did in the first quarter. The firmhas about $450 million under management.   Amerindo's latest newsletter is bullish on the market,saying it looks for a &quot;spectacular third-leg in an extendedrun that ought to carry over into the early 1990s.&quot;Specifically, it predicts the Dow Jones Industrial Averagewill break out of the &quot;2500-2800 trading mode that it hasbeen in since last July by moving up to the 2700-3000 tradingarea, before ultimately breaking out again on the upside.&quot;   Amerindo recommends &quot;aggressive&quot; buying of stocks such asSequent Computer Systems Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., ChironCorp. and Amgen Inc.   &quot;In the first six months, earnings drove the market, andthat favored our stocks,&quot; says William Jeffery of Wall StreetAssociates Inc., another manager specializing in smallstocks. The firm, based in La Jolla, Calif., with about $400million under management. Like Amerindo, Wall StreetAssociates greatly outperformed one measure of small stocks,the Russell 2000, which rose 0.48% in the first half.   Mr. Jeffery says there is an &quot;ample supply&quot; of stocks withmarket capitalization under $400 million and superiorearnings growth. &quot;They probably will be able to survive aneconomic slowdown better than their bigger brethren, simplybecause they are more focused and have niches in the market,&quot;he says.   Among Mr. Jeffery's favorites: Software Toolworks Inc.,Conner Peripherals Inc., Cirrus Logic Inc. and Wholesale ClubInc.   CDA compiles performance data based on reports that moneymanagers are required to file quarterly with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission. Because of gaps in the filings, thedata aren't precise. They assume, for example, that the stockholdings remain in the managers' portfolios for the entirequarter. Cash holdings, bonds, convertible securities,foreign issues and short sales aren't included.   Returns also haven't been reduced to reflect the managers'fees. In addition, the various levels of risk that themanagers took to achieve their results aren't considered.
