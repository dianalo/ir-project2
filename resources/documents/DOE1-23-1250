In February 1986 the operation of DIII-D commenced. The spring andsummer of 1986 has been devoted to establishing high current plasmas(up to 2.5 MA) to be used as targets for neutral beam heating which willbe available in the fall. The demonstration of shaping control is wellin hand with stable elongated plasmas (b/a andgt; approx. 2) and fully developeddivertor discharges being routinely produced. The ability to bake to400/sup 0/C while simultaneously performing discharge cleaning is believedto be the primary factor that has led to the rapid cleanup of the vesseland achieving flattop loop voltages as low as 1 V/turn at plasma currentsof 2 MA.</TEXT></DOC>
