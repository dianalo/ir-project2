 That column exuded all the enthusiasm andjoy normally assicated with moving into a new home, but the column you arereading now will reflect the darker side of home-buying: specifically, thehellishness of financial institutions.andP;  A case study, which tells a sad storyabout borrowing money from a major financial institution, follows.andM;After having been assured that all was well with my financial report and Ishould move into my new house within a week, I received a last-minute phonecall from the lending institution.andP;  &quot;We've just discovered a problem withyour credit history,&quot; my &quot;friendly&quot; representative said ominously.andP;  How couldthis be, I wondered?andP;  No outstanding debts, everything paid for, nothing onmy VISA or MasterCard.andP;  What's the deal?andM;&quot;In March of 1984, you missed a $35 payment on your Montgomery Ward's chargecard.andP;  You received a 30-day late notice.andP;  Do you know how serious this is?&quot;andM;&quot;Surely you jest,&quot; I replied.andP;  &quot;I was travelling overseas for that wholemonth, and I paid off the entire bill with the next statement.&quot;andP;  For yourreference, this bill was for automotive sundries and amounted to a whopping$41.68.andM;&quot;This indicates negligent financial consideration on your part and gives usgreat concern about your ability to meet monthly payments.andP;  Don't call themoving van yet.andP;  We'll get back to you.&quot;andM;The moving van was already loaded and on its way out the driveway.andP;  Now itappeared its destination was unknown.andM;The loan was refused, and I turned it over to another financial institution.andO;My new friendly representative said the bank would be happy to do businesswith me.andP;  After receiving all my pertinent data in record time--I was payinghourly for the moving van's parking place--the bank said they needed only onemore tiny bit of information.andP;  &quot;This shouldn't take long, but since you ownyour own company, we'll have to check your profit and loss statements andyour tax returns ince 1970.&quot;andP;  Splendid.andP;  No problem.andP;  I was 11 years old in1970.andM;FINANCIAL FREZNYandM;Everything worked out, however, and the loan was ultimately approved.andP;  When Iwent to sign the title papers, yet another obstacle loomed.andP;  Apparently theparent of the bank (located in California) was suing the parent of the titlecompany (in Texas) and therefore would not honor any title insurance conveyedby any subsidiary, including the title company.andP;  Without title insurance, youdon't get a title.andP;  And most title companies want a 45-day review of the homebuilder to make sure no mechanics' liens exist on unpaid contracts.andM;When I recovered from the shock, I was in my new house, but I probably willnever know how I got there, because it sure wasn't through the efficiency ormunificence of the financial institutions with whom I did business.andP;  I workedwith seven financial service institutions before my loan was approved.andO;Except for the bank where I do my business banking, all these institutionsredefined the term &quot;confused.&quot;andP;  This business area can clearly use all thehelp it can get, and probably a lot more that it can't.andM;Fortunately, help is on the way from a most unlikely source: expert systems.andM;We've discussed financial expert systems occasionally in this space before,but these days financial institutions are spending money on expert systems inrecord numbers.andP;  Every major financial institution you can think of is doingsomething in AI, be it expert systems, neural networks, or natural language.andO;After the government and Dept.andP;  of Defense, financial services seems to beAI's next biggest market.andP;  Spending for AI now equals maintenance anddiagnostic systems spending.andM;None of my financial &quot;friends&quot; appears to be using expert-system technology,but I have compiled a list of some expert systems from worldwideorganizations that serve--and service--the needs of financial customers.andO;It's a long list, so you might want to take a quick snack break here or getpositioned in your favorite armchair.andP;  Whatever you do, don't invite yourpersonal banker over for a fireside reading.andP;  You wouldn't want to give himor her any ideas on how to improve business, would you?andM;FINANCIAL FINESSEandM;We'll start with a look at examples from th largest segment of the marketthat has taken expert systems under its wing: the insurance business.andM;Blue Cross of Pennsylvania has developed NERsys, aninsurance-claim-processing package, with Gold Hill products.andM;Coopers andamp; Lybrand has created ExMARINE, which has nothing to do with gruntsand boot camp.andP;  This application is for use in maritime underwriting and wasdeveloped internally using the company's own tools.andM;Mony, those people who made Tommy James and Billy Idol famous, have a systemcalled CLUES, used for underwriting life insurance policies.andP;  CLUES wasdeveloped with Teknowledge's help.andM;The state of Washington uses a system that helps speed the flow of claimsprocessing, developed with Aion's products.andM;Ernst andamp; Whinney has developed a European/U.K.andP;  system using the popularCrystal expert-system tool.andP;  The application, called the Latent DamageSystem, gauges some of the risks in insurance and litigation claims arisingfrom negligence.andP;  It seems to me that the legal industry could also use allthe help it can get, but that's a story for another column.andM;FINANCIAL FREEDOMandM;The next big area of interest in finance appears to be in funds and portfoliomanagement.andP;  In addition to applications created by individual companies,this area has had lots of products developed for resale, such as Apex'sPlanPower, ITG's Intelligent Portfolio, Athena Group's Portfolio ManagementAdvisor, and EXPERTeam France's Finexpro.andM;Chase Lincoln Bank developed the Personal Financial Planning System, which isused, coincidentally enough, for customers' financial-planning needs.andP;  It wasdeveloped with Arthur D. Little.andM;Northwestern National Life created Watchdog, a system developed withPEAKSolutions that monitors bond investments.andP;  (Kind of like a watchdog,don't ya know?)andM;Generale Bank Belgium was one of the first organizations to use easilyaccessed financial expert systems when it made Le Courtier available to itscustomers.andP;  Developed by Cognitive/Intelligent Business Systems, Le Courtieris sort of like an ATM for stock-market investing.andM;FINANCIAL FINAGLINGandM;Lending institutions obviously have a warm spot in my heart, if not my house.andO;Like insurance companies, lending institutions use AI to minimize risks.andM;Peat Marwick and IBI/LEVEL5 developed the Loan Probe, which evaluates loansusing IBM PCs.andP;  Both companies believe this to be one of the largest expertsystems residing on a PC.andM;Arthur Andersen is another company that used Aion to develop a financepackage--in this case, the Mortgage Loan Analyzer, which does exactly what itsounds like it does.andM;Bank of America used the U.K.-based Helix Expert System to create the CreditLetter Advisor, which validates all the necessary features of a letter ofcredit.andM;Now, all this lending and borrowing and exchanging of money adds fuel to awhole different financial fire: taxes.andP;  We've all read about Coopers andamp;Lybrand's ExperTAX, which was top of the pops as far as interesting expertsystems went in 1988.andP;  That company now offers ExperTAX as part of adiagnostic service the company's clients can use.andP;  This means the firm hastaken a heretofore internal tool and made it a commercial vehicle.andM;No tax category (not even one involving AI) is really complete without someintervention on the IRS's part.andP;  Determined to get your money no matter thecost (even if the cost is more than what you owe), the IRS has a systemcalled the Automated Issue Identification application.andP;  This package,developed by Bolt Beranek andamp; Newman, aids in selecting returns that should beclassified as &quot;potential audits&quot; by flagging areas of a return.andP;  Just what weneed, another tool for the benefit of the IRS.andP;  If you get audited by the IRSin the next year or so, I have a couple names at BBN you might want.andM;FINANCIAL FOOLINGandM;Since people like Mike Milken made more money on their way to work yesterdaythan you or I will make this entire year, the trading and brokeringbusinesses are naturally under quite a bit of scrutiny.andP;  Although thisscrutiny hasn't extended into all areas of trading, some organizations, suchas Bear Stearns andamp; Co., are monitoring their own traders through expertsystems.andP;  The Securities and Exchange Commission is monitoring the filing ofcorporate 10K/Q financial reports by using an expert system to search fordiscrepancies.andP;  Once again, Arthur Andersen was involved in setting up thisapplication.andM;Plenty of other companies with an interest in finance are delving into expertsystems.andP;  Top-Center Insurance of Denmark has FIRUS, a fire-risk underwritingsystem.andP;  Yale University has a payroll-management system.andP;  Citibank hasPension Disbursement for calculating pension payroll taxes.andP;  Chemical Bankand Manufacturers Hanover have developed applications for foreign exchange.andO;Security Pacific developed a PROLOG-based system for appraising residentialreal estate.andP;  ARCO uses an expert system for materials accounting.andP;  BancTecis attempting to use a neural net system for recognizing and verifyingsignatures for check processing.andP;  The Chicago Board of Trade has amicroExplorer-based system for performing 24-hour trades.andP;  The list goes onand on.andM;Interestingly, finance is one of the biggest areas of AI development in theEuropean community.andP;  With the world becoming a 24-hour financial marketplace,the use of expert systems by any of the major financial centers (New York,Tokyo, London) could mean significant competitive advantages in the nearfuture.andP;  The 1992 European economic consolidation only validates thisfurther.andP;  Financial experts will be in big demand for quite some time.andM;The next natural step in the computerization of the financial community isadding intelligence to financial computers.andP;  Who knows?andP;  We may end up withsmart checking accounts and credit cards or intelligent expense-reportsystems.andP;  If the U.S.andP;  government got into the act, we'd have a wealth ofexpertise to draw on.andP;  The Oliver North Charitable and/or PersonalContribution Fund System, the John Tower Travel, Entertainment, and MoreEntertainment Expense Report, and the ever-popular James Wright Blind Trustand Conflict of Interest Application are just a few possibilities.andP;  Ipersonally like the Jim Wright application because it lets you spend moneythat isn't yours on things your're not supposed to buy, and there's alwayssome left over for your spouse.andP;  Best of all, you don't even have to show upfor work to collect it.andP;  Talk about untapped expertise.andM;Harvey P.
