West Germany and France have proposed an immediate $15billion infusion of international aid, while Britain and theU.S. say cash won't do any good unless serious economicreforms are in place. Soviet economists say that the helpwould be welcome, but that the country simply isn't ready toabsorb it yet.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'm not sure such aid today would be effective,&quot; saysOleg Bogomolov, an influential radical economist. &quot;It won'tsolve any of the cardinal problems.&quot;   Even Soviet government officials reject the quick fix ofusing Western funds to fill empty Soviet shelves. &quot;All themoney in the world probably won't be enough to speed upeconomic reform if we only do it through consumer goods,&quot;says Andrei Bugrov, a Foreign Ministry official specializingin international economic relations.   Before any aid could be effective, some Western and Sovietexperts argue, the country must start price reforms,industrial privatization, reconstructing its banking systemand building better supports for foreign investment. Linkingthe aid to such economic conditions could actually helpSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev push through unpopularreforms.   But political conditions would be out of the question,Soviet officials say. And many countries that are consideringparticipating in the aid plan clearly have their ownpolitical agendas.   West Germany, which initiated the idea, wants Sovietacceptance of German reunification. The U.S. says it mightnot participate unless the Soviet Union stops funding Cubaand cuts its own military spending. Japan, now the world'sbiggest creditor, won't give economic aid until it and Moscowresolve their dispute over four islands north of Japan thatthe Soviet Union has held since 1945.   &quot;Any intention to call the Soviet Union on the carpet inHouston and dictate political conditions is extremelyunrealistic,&quot; wrote Lev Strzhizhovsky in Pravda, theCommunist Party daily. &quot;There can be only one approach andeveryone in Houston should know it: `yes' to assistance, but`no' to political conditions.&quot;   The aid package is likely to dominate discussions at theHouston meeting of seven major industrial nations. The G-7summit participants -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,Britain, Italy and Canada -- are split on whether giving aidis a good idea at all, and if so, how to go about it.   The goal of France and West Germany is to help Moscowthrough a difficult transition from 70 years of commandeconomy to a supply-and-demand market system. As a statementof support for Mr. Gorbachev and his perestroika policies,the aid plan emerged at the right time, just before thecrucial congress of the Communist Party that is now under wayand which could determine whether perestroika continues orstalls.   Last year, the G-7 countries called on the Soviets toundertake specific economic reforms. Since then, severalreforms have been proferred and rejected, and the Sovieteconomy has spiraled downward. Inflation is estimated at 10%,the budget deficit last year hit 100 billion rubles ($170billion at the official exchange rate or $16 billion at themore realistic tourist rate), and hard currency debt nowstands at about $45 billion.   When West Germany first suggested the aid plan last month,it clearly wanted to give Mr. Gorbachev quick relief until amore acceptable reform program could get off the ground. Someof the money was proposed for food and consumer goods, to getproducts on the shelves immediately.   On its own late last year, the Gorbachev governmentimported about 10 billion rubles of soap, food and clothingin an attempt to soothe the tempers of striking miners andfrustrated city shoppers. At first the shipments did thetrick, but within a month the shelves were bare again andnothing fundamental had changed.   Many Soviet economists say that's the reason aid should belinked to specific economic reforms or sorely neededinfrastructure such as roads and telecommunications. Themoney must be earmarked for specific investments to avoid theproblems that plagued Poland in the 1970s, when tens ofbillions of dollars of foreign investment and loans werewasted, leaving the country with a huge foreign debt and lotsof outmoded equipment.   Frustrated by the government's cautious approach toreform, other Soviet economists say attaching economicconditions to the aid could be just the lever needed to getthings moving. Without such external pressure, the stumblingblocks in the way of economic reform will take too long toremove.</TEXT></DOC>
