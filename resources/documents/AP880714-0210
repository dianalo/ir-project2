The move from 9 percent to 9.5 percent marked the second timethis year the nation's banks have raised the prime, a key rate usedto calculate a range of fixed and adjustable-rate corporate andconsumer loans.   Chase Manhattan Bank in New York was the first to announce therate increase and others quickly matched it, putting the prime atthe highest point since March 1986.   Economists had been expecting such a move because of evidencethat the Federal Reserve has tightened credit over the past fewmonths through its control of the amount of money in the bankingsystem. This control is one of the Fed's principal weapons toforestall higher inflation.   The rate increase came one day after the central bank'schairman, Alan Greenspan, told Congress in his twice-annual reportthat the Fed had been tightening and that holding down inflationremained his key priority. Some economists saw a significantconnection between his remarks and the banks' action.   ``This is one of the few times the Fed really has to saypublicly what it's going to do, so we wanted to see that,'' saidJohn Oliver Wilson, chief economist at Bank of America in SanFrancisco. ``The prime would have gone up no matter what he said,but it was a question of how much.''   M. Kathryn Eickhoff, president of the Eickhoff Economicsconsulting firm and a former policy director in the Office ofManagement and Budget, said the increase in the prime wasrelatively moderate, reflecting confidence in Greenspan'sprediction that interest rates would not rise dramatically thisyear.   Others said the prime rate increase had little or nothing to dowith Greenspan's remarks and merely compensated for the risingcosts of borrowing that banks have been facing.   These costs have narrowed the difference between what banks payfor money in the credit markets and what they charge to lend it,known as he spread, which is how banks make their profit.   An important indicator of bank costs is the federal funds rate,the interest on overnight loans between banks. The rate has beennudging upward toward 8 percent, compared with about 7 percent afew months ago.   Although many economists have said interest rates will not risemuch further before the November election, a few predicted moreprime rate increases into double-digit territory in the monthsahead, possibly by the end of summer, if the banks' cost ofborrowing keeps rising.   ``Overall, this is just one more piece of ammuniion to show thatinterest rates are headed up,'' said William Veronda, portfoliostrategist and credit market economist at Financial Programs Inc.,a Denver investment firm.</TEXT></DOC>
