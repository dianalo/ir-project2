(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A $65 million Navstar navigationsatellite rocketed into orbit early today, a half hour after liftofffrom Cape Canaveral.   A three-stage Delta 2 rocket blazed away from its launch pad at1:58 a.m. and left a fiery trail in the sky as it sped over theAtlantic Ocean and climbed toward space.   The Air Force reported 30 minutes after liftoff that the128-foot-tall rocket had performed flawlessly and had propelled thesatellite into an initial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to11,000 miles above the Earth.   ``The Delta 2 has put its payload into a successful orbit,'' saidLt. Col. Ron Rand, the launch control center commentator.   On Sunday, ground controllers will command an on-board motor tofire to shift the satellite into a circular orbit about 11,000 milesup.   The $30 million Delta rocket carried a Navstar Global PositioningSystem Satellite, the third in a new series of spacecraft whichenable military units such as aircraft, ships, submarines, tanks andfield troops to determine their location within 50 feet and in somecases to within 10 feet.   The satellites, effective in any kind of weather, also keep trackof military units' speed within a fraction of a mile per hour andthe precise time within a millionth of a second.   Each 3,675-pound Navstar contains an atomic clock with an errorrate of one second every 300,000 years.   American and allied military users receive information from acoded channel. Civilian users, also with access to the satellitesystem, would monitor an open channel providing them with lessaccurate position information within 300 feet.   The satellite launched today is the third of 21 upgraded Block 2Navstars that the Air Force plans to orbit to complete a globalsystem by 1992. The first two were launched in February and June.   Seven earlier Block 1 Navstars also are orbiting the Earth. Thenew model has more power and improved systems and has added thecoded military channel.</TEXT></DOC>
