Four years ago, most of the major presidential contenders ran into air-safety problems serious enough to give Secret Service agents sweaty palms. Walter Mondale's jet skidded sideways down a runway. John Glenn's plane nearly slammed into a control tower during a blizzard. An engine on Gary Hart's plane burst into flames during flight. Jesse Jackson's plane was buffeted so violently by heavy winds that passengers got sick.    As the political barnstorming accelerates for 1988, some campaign veterans fear there will be another round of air scares. &quot;I have this queasy feeling in my stomach that because of the frenetic pace, and the tremendous pressures to reach places, even through blizzards, that sooner or later a campaign plane is going to run into serious trouble or go down,&quot; says Patricia O'Brien, a former political correspondent for Knight-Ridder Newspapers and former press secretary for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, one of six Democratic presidential candidates.    In a chilling episode recently, a small plane carrying Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., a Democratic presidential contender, made an emergency landing in Texas after developing an electrical problem.    During presidential campaigns, the overriding goal of all candidates is to get as much media exposure as possible in major markets each day. To accomplish this, candidates rush from stop to stop, and sometimes ignore potential threats to air-safety such as bad weather and flight-crew fatigue.    Critics say that the Federal Aviation Administration should do more to ensure compliance with maintenance requirements and other rules. Further, they say campaigns should place more emphasis on safety and that news organizations, which are charged top dollar by campaigns for space on the charters, should insist that safety be the highest priority.    &quot;I think if your safety is endangered you ought to act on it,&quot; says Clark Hoyt, Washington bureau chief for Knight-Ridder Newspapers. &quot;Someone shouldn't be risking his or her life to cover the presidential campaign.&quot; In 1972, Mr. Hoyt and another reporter assigned to the presidential campaign of the late Sen. Henry Jackson refused to get on a charter plane that was leaking a steady stream of oil.    Air safety doesn't play much of a role in campaign tradition. For reporters, campaign planes are ideal for pillow fights, drinking and dancing in the aisles. Reporters are loath to buckle up their seat belts; some even slide down the aisle on the plastic safety-instruction cards during takeoff. When flights get rough, they sing &quot;Nearer My God to Thee.&quot;    But campaign travel does pose hazards. As campaigns heat up, candidates switch from regular airline flights, which have an extremely low accident rate, to charter flights, which have a substantially higher rate, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. There aren't separate figures for campaign planes, nor are there separate FAA safety rules for them.    There are strong temptations to let safety slip. Many charter companies demand all or part of their payment beforehand, so at times a low-cost company that cuts corners is used. Pilots sometimes are pressured by campaign aides to get their candidate to the next debate or rally on time, even if that means barreling through bad weather. &quot;The trouble with all these damn flights is that they are always driven by schedule,&quot; says Hodding Carter, a journalist and former State Department spokesman who did some traveling with the Jackson campaign in 1984.    Anthony Broderick, associate FAA administrator for aviation standards, insists that there &quot;isn't any special problem&quot; with campaign planes. However, he does urge campaigns to take a close look at the charter companies they use. &quot;They (the companies) all meet our requirements,&quot; he says. &quot;But some exceed the minimums by a lot . . . and some exceed them by a little.&quot;    Terrifying flights have long provided campaign lore, but in 1984 the stories took a grim turn. In February of that year, a four-engine Lockheed Electra chartered from Galaxy Airlines by Sen. Glenn's presidential campaign climbed abruptly as it was trying to land in heavy snow at Sioux City, Iowa. That sent Sen. Glenn, the former Marine flier and astronaut, scurrying into the cockpit to talk to the pilot. It turned out that the plane narrowly missed the control tower on the first try.    A few months later, the same plane was used on a Jackson campaign flight through tornado-racked Texas that was so harrowing that &quot;most of us had pretty much gone through the inventory when you think you're getting ready to die,&quot; recalls Mr. Carter. In January 1985, while carrying a group of Minnesota residents home from a gambling junket, the plane crashed near Reno, Nev., killing 64 people, including the pilot who had flown for candidates Jackson and Glenn.    In June 1984, the engine of a Boeing 707 chartered by the Hart campaign caught fire shortly after takeoff and had to return to Philadelphia for an emergency landing. &quot;You get very fatalistic about these things,&quot; shrugs Mr. Hart. That fall, Air Force Two, with Vice President George Bush on board, had to dive sharply to avoid hitting a small plane while landing in Seattle.    Perhaps sobered by the 1984 experiences, some candidates this season are taking precautions, such as insisting on two pilots even when the rules don't require it. In addition, says Sen. Gore, &quot;We do a careful check of the nature of the equipment and who the pilots are -- and how much sleep they get.&quot;    Even that isn't a guarantee that everything will go smoothly, as his recent emergency landing shows. That's why Donna Brazile, national field organizer for the presidential campaign of Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) drives whenever possible -- even if it's from Washington to Des Moines and back. &quot;If somebody said to me there is an emergency in Minnesota, I'd find eight other people before I'd do it,&quot; says Ms. Brazile. &quot;I am the person of last resort.&quot;    ---                    Airline Accident Rates                Scheduled Airlines vs. Charters                  (per 100,000 aircraft hours)                                             CHARTERS                       SCHEDULED        LARGE        SMALL                        AIRLINES       PLANES       PLANES 1976                     0.376         0.913         5.07 1977                     0.328         2.076         4.78 1978                     0.332         0.986         5.58 1979                     0.343         3.618         4.34 1980                     0.221         1.482         4.73 1981                     0.380         0.418         5.42 1982                     0.233         1.526         4.05 1983                     0.331         0.710         5.44 1984                     0.161         1.231         4.74 1985                     0.227         1.452         5.46 1986*                    0.235         0.929         4.27 *Preliminary Source: National Transportation Safety Board</TEXT></DOC>
