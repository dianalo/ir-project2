Impinger samples from the mixing, forming, curving, pipefinishing, coupling finishing, and epoxy areas contained 0.2 to 2.4,1.0 to 2.8, 0.8 to 2.7, 1.2 to 3.8, 1.3 to 23.7, and 2.0 million particlesper cubic foot (mppcf), respectively. Several samples from the finishingarea exceeded the threshold limit value (TLV) of 5 mppcf. Correspondingasbestos concentrations determined by the membrane-filter method were0.8 to 19.6, 0.3 to 8.7, 0.6 to 3.1, 2.1 to 11.5, 2.3 to 33.4, and 1.8to 3.5 fibers greater than 5 microns per cubic centimeter (f/cc). Inthe packing area, membrane-filter samples indicated asbestos concentrationsof 0.1 to 8.6 f/cc. No standards existed for evaluating membrane-filtersamples, however, concentrations greater than 10.0 f/cc over a 3 monthperiod were considered high.</TEXT></DOC>
