(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Army officials knew or should have knownabout health and safety hazards threatening civilian workers at theU.S. Military Academy that prompted inspectors to cite 156violations, a federal official says.   Of the violations found by the U.S. Occupational Safety andHealth Administration, 107 were classified as ``serious,'' meaningthey held a ``substantial probability that death or serious injurycan result,'' John Tomich, OSHA's New York regional director, saidThursday.   Tomich said he was uncertain whether any serious injuries hadresulted from the violations, which included bare electrical wires,a chlorine gas hazard and unsafe machines.   The military also clearly knew about 30 additional problems butfailed to make a ``reasonable'' effort to rectify them, Tomich said.   In some cases, academy officials had hoped to remove the hazardsbut may have been hampered by budgetary restraints, Tomich said.   ``A lot of the violations have to do with basic safety,'' saidTomich, whose Albany office headed the investigation. ``For whateverpurpose ... the conditions were allowed to exist. We were surprisedat the number of violations and the severity of them.''   West Point officials said the report, which was sent to theacademy this week, still had to be reviewed by the school'ssuperintendent, Lt. Gen. Dave Palmer, and they declined comment.   OSHA's August 1988 probe was the first time the federal safetyenforcement agency had investigated West Point. The OSHA team wasdispatched after the academy's occupational accident rate rose abovethe national average for the first time in 1988, Tomich said. Thenational average was 2.79 accidents per 100 workers a year. Tomichsaid it was 3.85 at West Point.   Besides 3,800 civilian employees, 4,400 cadets and 1,600 militarypersonnel are at West Point, said academy spokeswoman AndreaHamburger.   OSHA is only authorized to investigate civilian worksites. Tomichsaid fewer than half of those were inspected at the academy, and thesites chosen were considered ``high hazard'' areas.   ``The thing that we were surprised at was the sheer numbers thatwe had here,'' Tomich said. ``We had 80 or 90 pages of citations,which is not your normal case. And that's not even going into theentire facility wall to wall.''   Among the violations found by OSHA:   _At the cadet gym, the academy failed to properly separate tanksof sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid near the pool. Thecombination of the two chemicals would create dangerous chlorinegas, Tomich said, adding, ``The potential for them to mix wasthere.''   _Inadequate ventilation at the indoor rifle and pistol rangecreated a potentially dangerous exposure to lead particles frombullets.   _Many machines failed to have adequate safeguards against aworker getting caught in the apparatus. Tomich said there was ``riskof amputation.''   _Numerous cases where electrical wiring was either exposed orunsuitable. Tomich said employees risked coming in contact with livewires and being electrocuted.   _Elevated working platforms failed to have guardrails.   _Many exits were padlocked, violating fire safety codes.   Despite failing to address these problems, Tomich said hedetected no ``blatant disregard'' for civilian safety.   In many cases, he said, Army officials ``basically justtransferred that information onto a notice of unsafe condition andposted it in the area but never corrected it.''</TEXT></DOC>
