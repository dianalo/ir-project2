North and John M.Poindexter, indicted on criminal charges in the Iran-Contra affair.   Carter told a meeting of government and business leaders thatReagan showed ``a callous attitude toward the principles of lawenforcement'' when he said Friday that North and Poindexter wouldbe found innocent of the charges and that he still thinks North isa hero.   ``I think they violate basic principles of law enforcement inthis country for the chief law enforcement officer _ that isPresident Reagan, in case you've forgotten _ to make the statementthat indicted persons are guilty in his opinion ... or notguilty,'' Carter said at a meeting held at Gannett Co. Inc.headquarters in suburban Arlington, Va.   North and Poindexter, along with arms dealers Richard V. Secordand Albert A. Hakim, pleaded innocent Thursday to charges ofconsipiracy, theft and fraud in the Iran-Contra case.   Reagan has said previously he did not think any laws were brokenin the Iran-Contra affair.   In what seemed to be an off-the-cuff response to a questionposed from the audience after a speech to young people Friday,Reagan said, ``I just have to believe they're going to be foundinnocent because I don't think they were guilty of any lawbreakingor any crime.   ``I still think Ollie North is a hero,'' the president said.</TEXT></DOC>
