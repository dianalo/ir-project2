They added that the machine will be a me-too product interms of the technology it incorporates, as IBM continues tostruggle to overcome a disastrous start in the portablecomputer market. But the executives said it will carry afairly aggressive price tag. A spokeswoman for IBM, ofArmonk, N.Y., declined to comment.</LP><TEXT>   The executives said the IBM computer will use a version ofthe Intel Corp. 386SX central processor that will be 25% to33% slower than the versions available in some competitors'notebooks. The executives said the computer will come with a40-megabyte hard disk drive -- while competitors' productstypically include more storage capacity. The machine willcome with two megabytes of main memory and will weigh 6.2pounds, a bit heavier than some notebooks but well within thestandard range. Although the list price apparently hasn't yetbeen set, the executives said it will be around $2,500. Thatmeans an actual retail price of perhaps as little as $1,800.By contrast, a comparable machine from Toshiba Corp. isadvertised this week for $2,000, and a similar machine fromAST Research Inc. is advertised at $1,900.   The issue of IBM's development of laptop computerssurfaced yesterday when IBM and Groupe Bull of Franceannounced a broad technology-sharing arrangement. Theagreement includes a provision for IBM to buy portablecomputers from Bull's Zenith Data Systems unit for resaleunder IBM's label. IBM may also get some development helpfrom Zenith, which has typically been out in front on laptoptechnology but hasn't been able to muster much marketingforce.   Although the IBM-Bull announcement was vague, the industryexecutives said the Zenith part of the agreement didn'tconstitute any sort of admission of defeat by IBM in thelaptop market. The executives said IBM would merely buyZenith products that will fill holes in its emerging productline. They said, for instance, that IBM hasn't beendeveloping a laptop using the Intel 386SL chip, which isproving to be popular largely because it can as much asdouble the battery life of a laptop. Zenith has such alaptop, so IBM might decide to resell the Zenith machine, theexecutives said.   They said IBM will continue with its own productdevelopment and should introduce this year a battery-poweredlaptop containing a color screen. Because color screenstypically require too much power for batteries to handle, theIBM color machine could be a technological innovation,depending on whether the company beats its competitors to themarket. The executives said IBM also plans to introduce thisyear some notebooks and laptops that contain the 386SLC chip,a version of the Intel 386SX chip that IBM has modified torun almost twice as fast.   One of those machines will need to be a breakthrough ifIBM is to finally become a presence in laptops. IBM lost alot of credibility early on, when its first laptops andportables flopped. It finally produced a good portable, butthat was about the time the market for the heavy machinesleveled off and laptops, at 15 pounds or less, took over.   In late 1990, IBM appeared to have a winner with a laptopit was about to unveil. But it ran into last-minute delaysthat pushed the product into March 1991. Then IBM overpricedthe product. While the list price started at $6,000, it hasfallen to $3,645 in just 10 months, and dealers say theinitial problems have hurt sales.   IBM has apparently continued to face problems, because ithad initially talked about filling out its laptop productline last fall, but those announcements have slipped intothis year.</TEXT></DOC>
