ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two Air Force retirees who helped supply theNicaraguan Contras testified Monday they also got involved in theIran arms deals through an Oliver North associate, the first mentionof Iran in North's month-old trial.   The testimony by Richard B. Gadd _ and later by Robert Dutton _brought a quick reaction from U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell,who reminded lawyers in the case, ``I asked you not to go into thehostage situation.''   Charges involving diversion to the Contras of profits from theIran arms deals were dropped earlier after the administrationcomplained that too much damaging classified material would have tobe disclosed in connection with those counts.   Gesell called lawyers to the bench Monday and said bringing upIran and the hostages ``will extend the trial unnecessarily.''   However, defense attorney Brendan Sullivan continued to dwell onthe Iran issue in his questioning.   With the jury out of the courtroom, he told Gesell that thearms-to-Iran initiative is mentioned in four of the 12 countsremaining against North and that prosecutor John Keker repeatedlyreferred to Iran in his opening statement to the jury.   Said the 78-year-old Gesell: ``I'm simply trying to limit proofso we could end this trial while I'm still alive.''   Gadd testified he was brought into the Iran deals by former Maj.Gen. Richard Secord, who told him, ``This could lead to the releaseof the hostages in Lebanon.''   ``General Secord asked me to assist in the transportation of armsto Iran,'' Gadd testified.   Dutton, who followed Gadd to the stand, said he went to work forSecord the day after he retired after 20 years in the Air Force onMay 1, 1986, and was put to work on the Contra supply operation,which was suffering from disorganization.   He said he had worked with Secord in the 1980 attempt to rescuethe 52 American hostages held in Iran and was called by the retiredgeneral again to help in 1986.   Dutton was asked Monday if he believed the new effort was to beunder the authority of the president.   Yes, he said.   When Dutton first joined the Contra resupply operation, he said,none of the airdrops had been successful. Signal fires that pilotsexpected weren't there, radio communications didn't happen. BySeptember, he said, things had been whipped into shape and there hadbeen 15 successful missions.   Dutton was so proud of the progress that he put together an albumof pictures and showed them to North.   ``He said he would like to take it with him and show it to histop boss,'' said Dutton.   ``Who did you understand he was talking about?'' asked MichaelBromwich, one of the prosecution lawyers.   ``The president of the United States,'' said Dutton.   He said North told him ``I know I ca't get you a medal, but someday the president will shake your hand and thank you.'' But thatnever happened, Dutton said.   Dutton said the supply flights stopped after Oct. 5, 1986, whenone of the planes was shot down. The pilot, co-pilot and a Contrawere killed and the loadmaster, Eugene Hasenfus, bailed out and wascaptured.   At day's end Monday, conservative fund-raiser Carl ``Spitz''Channel had begun testimony that was to be resumed Tuesday.   Gadd, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, helped handle thecovert effort to ship arms to the Contras in early 1986 _ whenofficial U.S. military aid was barred _ and ran flights withhumanitarian aid when that was legal.   In January 1986, Gadd said, ``I was told they desired to moveclassified cargo from the United States to Iran.'' Secord, he said,``asked if I could arrange that.''   Secord told him, Gadd said, that flights ``must leave from theUnited States, no one must know the cargo and no one must know theultimate destination. It could not land in Europe and could not gothrough customs. And he said it was possible the aircraft and crewcould be detained in Iran and not released.''   Gadd testified Secord became impatient while he was trying tofigure a way to meet the requirements. He quoted the former generalas saying once, ``You must figure this out. You must convinceSouthern Air Transport to do the job. This could lead to the releaseof the hostages.''   Southern Air Transport, which once was CIA-owned, by that timehad been turned over to private ownership and had been used to flyaid to the Contras.   The company did become involved in Iran arms flights, but Gaddwas not asked that specific question.   Gadd said Secord also asked him in 1986 to make the arrangementsto fly North and his boss, National Security Adviser RobertMcFarlane, to Iran.   McFarlane earlier pleaded guilty to charges in connection withthe Iran-Contra affair and was sentenced Friday in a separatefederal court to a $20,000 fine and probation but no prison term.   After Congress in October 1985 authorized $27 million to be spentfor humanitarian aid to the Contras, Gadd said he contracted withthe State Department to haul supplies to Central America.   Once, lethal weapons were added to the supplies by Contraofficials when a plane stopped in El Salvador to refuel on the wayto Hondurs, Gadd said.   Later at a meeting at the State Department, Gadd said, ``they putit to me this should never have been done...the mix should notexceed 10 percent'' arms and ammunition.   Among the 12 criminal charges against North are four counts oflying to Congress by denying his involvement in the Contra resupplyoperation.</TEXT></DOC>
