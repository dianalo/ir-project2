This action deletes certain technical and operational television broadcastregulations that are outdated and unnecessary. The majority of commentsfiled in response to the <T3>Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) </T3>in this proceeding generallysupported these rule amendments. 2. <T3>Separate operation of TV aural and visual transmitters. </T3>Televisionbroadcasts are usually composed of both picture and sound signals. Thepicture and sound generally are transmitted simultaneously via separatevideo and audio transmitters. Under certain conditions, however, programsmay consist of picture and sound transmissions that are unrelated to oneanother. For example, TV stations may provide an additional broadcast servicein the form of an audio program with or without visual material, or a videoinformational bulletin board with or without related sound information.Such a service might display the text of news, weather, and other reports.Currently, such service is restricted by our rules to ``graveyard hours''(12 midnight to 6 a.m.), or for only 15 minutes just prior to a stationregular sign-on time, if after 6 a.m. When those provisions were adoptedin 1980, the Commission was concerned that broadcasters might over usethis form of service by filling their program day with audio-only or video-onlybulletin board-like informational service, in place of normal programmingduring regular operational hours. 3. Upon reviewing the comments, all of which supported the proposed relaxation,the Commission can find no basis for continuing to preclude licensees frommaking a wider range of programming judgments. The Commission believesthat the public interest would better be served by allowing licensees toestablish the duration and time of day deemed to be most appropriate fortransmitting separate audio or video services. Therefore, the Commissionis amending andSection; 73.653 by eliminating all time restrictions pertainingto the transmission of separate aural and video service. 4. <T3>Power meter calibration. </T3>The rules currently require that a televisionbroadcast licensee have the capability to determine the station's visualpower at all times. The most popular method of complying with this regulationis use of a power meter that must be calibrated at least once every 6 months.Because the rules also stipulate that this meter should be calibrated asoften as necessary to ensure compliance with the appropriate power level,we find that the 6-month calibration requirement to be redundant. 5. While the comments filed in response to the <T3>Notice </T3>supported the requirement to perform meter calibrationas often as needed, they recommended that the Commission eliminate theperiodic 6-month calibration period as being duplicative of the generalcalibration requirement. Accordingly andSection; 73.663 is amended to reflectthis decision. 6. <T3>Color burst signal requirement. </T3>The color burst is a special synchronizingsignal, transmitted within the television picture signal, that enablesthe TV receiver to decode the color information for proper display on thescreen. During the transmission of black-and-white video programming, colorburst signals do not benefit reception. In fact, they have the potentialto degrade the picture quality if transmitted along with certain black-and-whitepicture signals. Thus, the rules currently require that the color burstsignal be omitted during the extended transmission of black-and-white programming..7. In recent years however, broadcasters have encountered certain operationaldisadvantages in omitting the color burst signal during black-and-whiteprogram production. Modern video equipment technology now utilizes thecolor burst signal for more than its original purpose of conveying transmittedcolor reference information. Popular types of video processing equipmentnow rely on the color burst for timing and synchronization informationto correct video signal stability or timing errors. For example, many productionvideo tape recorders (as opposed to most consumer equipment) require thecolor burst signal for proper operation. Consequently, broadcasters haveoccasionally requested and received waivers of our color burst rules ona case-by-case basis. Also, some broadcasters have suggested that the colorburst omission requirement should be eliminated because they believe thattoday's television receivers have been developed to the point that theyare immune to picture degradation caused by the color burst signal. 8. On the other hand, some television receiver manufacturers are skeptical,recalling that older model receivers have in fact experienced black-and-whitepicture degradation due to the color burst and that current receivers maynot be totally immune either. Thus, the manufacturers generally preferthat the current color burst omission standard be retained. 9. While the comments were divided over the extent of picture degradationcaused by the presence of the color burst, the Commission notes that thecolor burst omission requirement was established as a quality control regulationand does not relate to preventing or restricting cochannel or adjacentchannel interference. However, the comments have focused our attentionon the fact that the current requirement has become a television receiverinteroperability standard. Thus, television sets are currently designedand produced in accordance with the traditional objectives of the colorburst omission requirement. Therefore, the Commission believes the currentrule should be retained as a <T3>recommended </T3>standard instead of an absolute broadcast operatingrequirement. This approach is consistent with a 1985 action taken by theCommission with respect to standards relating to maximum horizontal andvertical blanking intervals (<T3>see Report and Order, </T3>MM Docket No. 79-145, 50 FR 13971, April9, 1985). Therefore, andSection; 73.699 is amended accordingly. 10.<T3> Equipment installation and safety specifications.</T3> The rules currentlycontain requirements pertaining to the construction and installation oftransmission systems and studio equipment, as well as related safety procedures.These requirements were imposed many years ago, when it was common forbroadcasters to design and build their own facilities. Today, nearly allbroadcasters acquire their transmission system equipment from manufacturersthat must design it to meet the safety requirements imposed by other regulatoryagencies (<T3>e.g.,</T3> OSHA and various local and state agencies).11. The comments favored elimination of the current requirements, but suggestedthat an advisory reference to pertinent federal, state, local or otherrecognized safety organizations standards and procedures would be appropriate.The Commission agrees and amends andSection; 73.687 accordingly.12.<T3> Reference table for conversion of minutes and seconds to decimal partsof a degree.</T3> This table contains mathematical conversions for minutes-to-decimaland seconds-to-decimal parts of a degree. These values may be used in thecalculation of geographical distance separations between television channelassignment locations. They were placed in the rules to provide the meansfor consistent and accurate calculations before the advent and widespreadavailability of electronic calculators and computers.13. The commenters agreed with the Commission that the table has becomesuperfluous and no longer needed because of the universal availabilityof electronic calculators and computers that provide far more accuracy.Therefore, the Commission is deleting from andSection; 73.698 the referencetable of minutes and seconds converted to decimal parts of a degree.14.<T3> Antenna radiation pattern limitations.</T3> Television broadcastingdirectional antennas may be useful in improving service, <T3>e.g., </T3>to reduce radiation over large bodies of water and concentrateit over populated areas. In such cases, the antennas must normally complywith restrictions that limit the ratio of the maximum radiated power atany point in the antenna pattern to the minimum radiated power at someother point in the pattern (the degree of suppression or null). The Commissionadopted these limits in the early 1950s. It concluded at that time thatthe limits were needed because of the difficulty in determining the actualradiated pattern of an antenna with very sharp nulls. Additionally, earlyantenna patterns were considered unstable, and more subject to televisionpicture ``ghosting'' degradation in null areas because of the exaggeratedsignal strength ratio that is possible between the directly received signaland other reflected signals.15. However, over the years broadcasters have been granted waivers to exceedthe current ratio limits in order to more effectively limit the power radiatedover large bodies of water, or to avoid excessive signal radiation towardthe face of a hill or mountain, which could reflect the signal and cause``ghosting'' degradation. Also, the current ratio limits have no relationshipwith the spacing criteria used to control interstation interference. Thus,the<T3> Notice</T3> proposed that these limits be eliminated.16. The comments, however, have convinced the Commission that while waiverspermitting the use of non-restricted radiation patterns are often appropriate(as described above), such operation might not be advisable in all situations,particularly in cases involving tightly located or short- spaced stations.The comments further expressed concern over the Commission's ongoing FMdirectional antenna proceeding, which is addressing a similar issue, butwhich does contemplate the short-spacing of FM station antenna sites (<T3>see</T3> MM Docket No. 87-121, 53 FR 12779, April 19, 1988). The commentsemphatically reject such short-spacing in the case of TV stations. Thus,the Commission's proposal to eliminate the current ratio limits receivedonly qualified support. Moreover, the record is inadequate in terms ofsuggesting what degree of relaxation in the limits might be appropriate.Because of the current controversy over the circumstances in which directionalantennas should be authorized, and because the Commission's current waiverprocess appears adequate in dealing with unusual situations, eliminationof the current rule does not appear to be a matter of great urgency. Accordingly,the Commission believes the appropriate course of action is to retain thecurrent rules for the time being, and reconsider this matter at some timein the future if circumstances warrant.17. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 603, theCommission notes that adoption of these provisions will provide broadcasterswith alternatives and increased flexibility in meeting their operationalrequirements.18. The rule amendments contained herein have been analyzed with respectto the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, and found to contain no new ormodified form, information collection, and/or record keeping, labeling,disclosure, or record retention requirement; and will not increase or decreaseburden hours imposed on the public.19. Accordingly, <T3>it is ordered that, </T3>Pursuant to authority contained in sections4(i) and 303 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, Part 73 ofthe Commission's Rules and Regulations are amended as set forth at theend of this document. <T3>It is further ordered, </T3>That this proceeding is terminated. <ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.
