TheCommission is directed to recommend modifications to the HTS (1) when amendmentsto the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Descriptionand Coding System, done at Brussels on June 14, 1983, and the Protocolthereto, done at Brussels on June 24, 1986 (Convention) are recommendedby the Customs Cooperation Council (Council) for adoption, and (2) as othercircumstances warrant. Continuous Review Authority Section 1205(a) provides that the Commission may recommend to the Presidentsuch modifications to the HTS as it believes necessary or appropriate_(A) To conform the HTS with amendments made to the Convention; (B) To promote the uniform application of the Convention and particularlythe Annex thereto, which contains the Harmonized Commodity Descriptionand Coding System (Harmonized System); (C) To ensure that the HTS is kept up-to-date in light of changes in technologyor in patterns of international trade; (D) To alleviate unnecessary administrative burdens; or (E) To make technical rectifications. Section 1205(d) provides that the Commission may not recommend any modificationto the HTS unless the modification is consistent with the Convention orany amendment thereto recommended for adoption. Additionally, recommendedmodifications must be consistent with sound nomenclature principles andmust ensure substantial rate neutrality. Modifications which involve achange in any rate of duty must be consequent to, or necessitated by, recommendednomenclature modifications. Moreover, the recommended modification mustnot alter existing conditions of competition for the affected U.S. industry,labor, or trade. ``Technical rectifications'', as used in subparagraph(E) above, are limited by section 1202(6) of the Act to rectificationsof an editorial character or minor technical or clerical changes whichdo not affect the substance or meaning of the text, such as errors in spelling,numbering, or punctuation, errors in indentation, errors (including inadvertentomissions) in cross-references to headings or subheadings or notes, andother clerical or typographical errors. Continuous Review Procedure The Commission will keep the HTS under continuous review and will recommendnecessary or appropriate modifications to the HTS when amendments to theHarmonized System are recommended for adoption by the Council, and as othercircumstances warrant, including at the request of interested Federal agenciesand the public.
