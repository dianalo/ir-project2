The claim stems from what Brent Walker says isworse-than-expected profit performance by William HillOrganization Ltd. and Mecca Bookmakers Ltd. Brent Walkerpurchased the two companies, which are based in London, in1989.</LP><TEXT>   Brent Walker didn't say how much of a rebate it wouldrequest from Grand Met, except to say it would be&quot;substantial.&quot;   The purchase agreement between the two companies calledfor an adjustment to the purchase price if the combinedpretax profit of William Hill and Mecca fell below #51million. Brent Walker said the combined pretax profit of theshops was &quot;substantially below&quot; that figure, according toaccounts drafted by its auditors.   A source familiar with the betting operations said thatBrent Walker may ask for an adjustment of as much as #166million. But Grand Met said a review of the accounts by itsauditors, KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, and outside auditors,Coopers andamp; Lybrand Deloitte, shows that there is no need foran adjustment to the purchase price.   Grand Met also rejected Brent Walker's claim that BrentWalker isn't liable to make a final #50 million payment, dueSept. 25. A Grand Met spokesman said the payment is aseparate issue from any adjustment of the purchase price.   Sources familiar with the two sides said discussions toresolve the dispute are being arranged. If the companies failto resolve the dispute between them, they will turn to anindependent auditor.</TEXT></DOC>
