The leakage radiation in the patientplane and at the surface of the electron applicators has been measuredfor applicator sizes from 6 cm x 6 cm to 25 cm x 25 cm and beam energiesfrom 6 to 22 MeV. For certain applicator/energy combinations the leakageradiation was significant. The leakage radiation, relative to the centralaxis dose, was found to be up to 7% in the patient plane and up to 39%at the applicator surface. Reducing the collimator setting or addinglead at select locations on the applicator surface was effective in reducingthe magnitude of the radiation leakage.</TEXT></DOC>
