The order authorizes regulations to establish grade, size,quality, maturity, pack, and container requirements for potatoes grownin 21 designated counties in Texas and 10 designated counties in New Mexico.In addition, the order authorizes production and marketing research andmarket development projects for High Plains potatoes. The program willbe administered by a committee of six producers, four handlers, and a publicmember, and be financed by assessments levied on potato handlers. The primaryobjective of the program is to improve the quality of potatoes shippedto fresh markets. This should reduce marketing losses, improve qualityfor consumers, and result in improved returns to producers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>June 2, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Robert F.

This order is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural MarketingAgreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act'' and the applicablerules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketingagreements and marketing orders (7 CFR Part 900). The marketing order was formulated on the record of a public hearing heldat Hereford, Texas, on April 19, 1988. Notice of the hearing was publishedin the April 4, 1988, issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This notice set forth a proposed order submittedby the Texas-New Mexico Potato Steering Committee on behalf of potato producersand handlers in the production area. The order authorizes regulations toestablish grade, size, quality, maturity, pack, and container requirementsfor potatoes produced in the production area. In addition, production andmarketing research and market development projects are authorized. Upon the basis of evidence introduced at the hearing and the record thereof,the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) on January25, 1989, filed with the Hearing Clerk, U.S. Department of Agriculture,a Recommended Decision providing opportunity to file written exceptionsthereto by March 2, 1989. One exception was received and was discussedand ruled upon in the Secretary's Decision. The Secretary's Decision and Referendum Order was issued April 19, 1989,and the referendum conducted May 1 through May 12, 1989. In the referendum,the marketing order was favored by more than two-thirds of the producersvoting in the referendum who also represented more than two-thirds of theproduction represented in the referendum. <T3>Small Business Consideration: </T3>In accordance with the provisionsof the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Administrator of the AMS has determined that thisaction will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. Small agricultural producers have been defined by theSmall Business Administration (SBA) (13 CFR 121.2) as those having averageannual gross revenues for the last three years of less than $500,000. Smallagricultural service firms, which would include handlers under this order,are defined as those with gross annual revenues of less than $3.5 million.The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders and rules issued thereunderare unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentiallysmall entities for their own benefit. Thus, both the RFA and the Act havesmall entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 30 handlers of potatoes in the High Plains area,who handled 2,848,000 hundredweight of potatoes for fresh market in 1986with an estimated crop value of about $26.3 million. While there is a variancein size of individual handler operations, most, if not all, of the handlersthat would be regulated under this order would qualify as small firms underSBA's definition. In addition, there are about 110 potato growers in theHigh Plains area, the majority of which could be classified as small businesses.While the order will likely impose regulations on handlers, the burdenof these regulatory requirements should not be significant compared tothe benefits which should accrue to such businesses. The expected impacton persons acting in a handling capacity who could be classified as smallbusinesses was discussed in detail in the Recommended Decision. In summary,the order should be operated in as efficient and economical a manner aswill tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. In this way allentities, small and large, would be subject to minimal regulatory requirementsunder the order. In addition, the order contains the authority to exemptfrom regulation special purpose shipments, as well as minimum quantities,and the order will be operated in a way that would incorporate sound businesspractices and efficiencies which would minimize the burden on all regulatedbusiness entities. Regulations promulgated under the order could be expected to remove fromfresh market channels less desirable grades and sizes of potatoes and divertthem to other outlets, such as livestock feed. An extensive cattle-feedingindustry exists within the production area which could serve as an outletfor culls, or low grade potatoes. Moreover, as the lower grades and smallersizes are removed from fresh market channels, prices to growers for theresulting higher quality supplies should increase, reflecting consumerpreference for this level of quality. This should outweigh any loss togrowers for cull potatoes, since such quality even on the fresh markethistorically returns little or nothing to the producer. Although a somewhat larger proportion of a producer's potatoes may be marketedin secondary outlets at a lower price, the greater part of production,which includes the higher or fresh market grades, should yield a greaterreturn. Thus, the order could be expected to have a positive impact ongrower returns. The impact of the order upon handlers is also expected to be positive.Most handlers perform their services for an established fee based on thequantity of potatoes handled for a producer. It is anticipated that mostpotatoes shipped to fresh market will be required to meet certain qualityand size requirements. It is also expected that an expansion of existingmarkets and the development of new ones will result from the increase inquality. Further, the burden placed on handlers by the order with respect to reportingand recordkeeping requirements should be negligible. Most of the informationthat would be reported to the committee is already compiled by handlersfor other uses and is readily available.  Reporting and recordkeeping requirements issued under comparable potatomarketing order programs impose an average annual burden on each regulatedhandler of about four hours. It is reasonable to expect that a comparableburden may be imposed under this order on the estimated 30 handlers ofHigh Plains potatoes. In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter35), the reporting and recordkeeping requirements that may be imposed underthis order would be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)and would not become effective prior to OMB approval. In determining that the order will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities, all of the issues discussedabove were considered. The order provisions have been carefully reviewedand every effort has been made to eliminate any unnecessary costs or requirements.Although the order may impose some additional costs and requirements onhandlers, it is anticipated that the programs under the order will helpto increase demand for potatoes grown in the High Plains area. Therefore,any additional costs should be offset by the benefits derived from expandedmarkets and sales benefiting handlers and producers alike. Accordingly, it is determined that this action will not have a significantimpact on small handlers or producers. Moreover, potatoes grown in more than one State will be regulated underthe order so as to effectuate the declared purposes of the Act. Thus, anymarketing orders, or their equivalent, authorized under respective Statestatutes could not achieve the same results as an alternative to a Federalmarketing order. In accordance with the principle and purpose of ExecutiveOrder 12612, consideration has been given as to whether the order willhave substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship betweenthe national government and the States, or on the distribution of powerand responsibilities among the various levels of government. It has been determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalismimplications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Determinations </ITAG>(a) <T3>Findings upon the basis of the hearing record. </T3>Pursuant to theprovisions of the Act and the applicable rules of practice and proceduregoverning the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders(7 CFR Part 900), a public hearing was held upon a proposed marketing agreementand a proposed order, regulating the handling of potatoes grown in theHigh Plains area of Texas and New Mexico. Upon the basis of the evidence introduced at the hearing and the recordthereof, it is found that:(1) The order, and all of the terms and conditions thereof, will tend toeffectuate the declared policy of the Act; (2) The marketing order regulates the handling of Texas-New Mexico HighPlains potatoes grown in the production area in the same manner as, andis applicable only to persons in the respective classes of commercial andindustrial activity specified in, the marketing order upon which a hearinghas been held; (3) The marketing order is limited in its application to the smallest regionalproduction area which is practicable, consistent with carrying out thedeclared policy of the Act, and the issuance of several orders applicableto subdivisions of the production area would not effectively carry outthe declared policy of the Act; (4) There are no differences in the production and marketing of Texas-NewMexico High Plains potatoes grown in the production area which makes necessarydifferent terms and provisions applicable to different parts of such area;and (5) All handling of Texas-New Mexico High Plains potatoes grown in theproduction area is in the current of interstate commerce or directly burdens,obstructs, or affects such commerce. (b) <T3>Additional findings. </T3>It is necessary and in the public interestto make this order effective June 2, 1989. Any delay beyond that date wouldinterfere with accomplishing the objectives of the order and the Act. The provisions of this order are known to handlers. The decision of theAssistant Secretary contained all provisions of this order and was issuedon April 19, 1989 (54 FR 17742). It is necessary for the order to be implementedduring the 1989 season, which begins in June. At the hearing, members ofthe High Plains potato industry testified that the lack of consistent qualitywas a problem area that must be improved. Record evidence indicates thatbecause of shipments of poor quality potatoes at the beginning of the season,prices for all High Plains potatoes tend to decline as the season progresses.Moreover, handlers who ship ungraded, unsized potatoes of questionablequality probably contribute to the generally unfavorable image of HighPlains potatoes that currently exists. Therefore, the record indicatesthat the need exists to regulate the marketing of High Plains potatoesthrough grade, size, quality, pack, container, or marking standards, therebyimproving quality which promotes more orderly marketing conditions andhigher returns to producers. To accomplish this objective, it is necessaryto make this order effective as soon as possible to provide adequate timeto appoint a committee, approve a budget, and establish an assessment rate.In view of the foregoing, it is hereby found and determined that good causeexists for making this order effective June 2, 1989, and that it wouldbe contrary to the public interest to delay the effective date of thisorder for 30 days after its publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (Section 553(d) Administrative Procedure Act,5 U.S.C. 551-559). (c) <T3>Determinations. </T3>It is hereby determined that handlers who, duringthe period January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1988, handled not lessthan 50 percent of the volume of potatoes grown in the production area,refused or failed to sign the proposed marketing agreement regulating thehandling of potatoes grown in the High Plains area of Texas and New Mexico;it is further determined that: (1) The refusal or failure of such handlers to sign the proposed marketingagreement tends to prevent the effectuation of the declared policy of theAct; (2) The issuance of this order is the only practical means pursuant tothe declared policy of the Act of advancing the interests of producersof potatoes grown in the production area; (3) The issuance of this order is favored or approved by at least two-thirdsof the producers who participated in a referendum on the question of itsapproval and who, during the period January 1, 1988, through December 31,1988 (which has been deemed to be a representative period), have been engagedwithin the High Plains area of Texas and New Mexico in the production ofpotatoes for fresh market, such producers having also produced for marketat least two-thirds of the volume of such commodity represented in thereferendum. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 949</ITAG>Marketing orders, Potatoes, Texas, New Mexico.<ITAG tagnum="85">Order Relative to Handling of Irish Potatoes Produced in the HighPlains Area of Texas and New Mexico</ITAG><T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>That on and after the effective datehereof, all handling of Irish potatoes grown in the production area shallbe in conformity to, and in compliance with, the terms and conditions ofthe said order as follows:The provisions of the marketing order are set forth in full herein.Therefore, Title 7, Chapter IX is amended by adding Part 949 to read asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>This part will appear in the annual Code of Federal Regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">PART 949_IRISH POTATOES GROWN IN THE HIGH PLAINS AREA OF TEXAS ANDNEW MEXICO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Definitions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.1 Secretary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.2 Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.3 Person.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.4 Production area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.5 Potatoes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.6 Seed potatoes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.7 Handler.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.8 Handle or ship.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.9 Producer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.10 Fiscal period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.11 Committee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.12 Grade, size and maturity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.13 Varieties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.14 Pack.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.15 Container.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.17 District.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.18 Export.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Committee</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.20 Establishment and membership.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.21 Alternates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.22 Term of office.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.23 Districts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.24 Redistricting and reapportionment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.25 Nominations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.26 Selection.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.27 Failure to nominate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.28 Acceptance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.29 Vacancies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.30 Expenses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.31 Procedure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.32 Powers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.33 Duties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Expenses and Assessments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.40 Expenses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.41 Budget.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.42 Assessments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.43 Accounting.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Research and Development</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.48 Research and development.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Regulation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.50 Marketing policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.51 Recommendations for regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.53 Issuance of regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.54 Modification, suspension or termination of regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.55 Handling for special purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Inspection</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.60 Inspection and certification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Reports and Recordkeeping</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.80 Reports and recordkeeping.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Compliance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.81 Compliance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Miscellaneous Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.82 Right of the Secretary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.84 Termination or suspension.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.85 Proceedings after termination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.86 Effect of Termination or amendment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.87 Duration of immunities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.88 Agents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.89 Derogation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.90 Personal liability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.91 Separability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">949.92 Amendments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority</T4>: Sec. 1-19, 48 Stat. 31, as amended;
