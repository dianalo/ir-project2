Officials gathered at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum toreminisce about the events surrounding its signing.   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin praised President Kennedy, whooversaw the U.S. side of negotiations, saying the treaty ``wouldnot have been attained without a fresh and sober look'' atsuperpower rivalry by ``that dynamic leader.''   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, brother of the late president, calledthe treaty a ``watershed event in Soviet-American relations ... thefirst major arms control agreement involving the superpowers.''   The treaty, signed July 25, 1963, after 10 days of negotiationsin Moscow involving Soviet, U.S., and British representatives,banned testing of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, in outer spaceand under water.   Other testing bans have been signed since, but the Test BanTreaty remains the only one ratified by both superpowers.   Former Soviet and U.S. participants in the negotiations agreedat a news conference that the treaty gave rise to a series of othernuclear arms pacts between the superpowers, including last year'saccord to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons.   McGeorge Bundy, special assistant for national security affairsfrom 1961 to 1966, told reporters the signing ``brought a prospectof further and larger agreements,'' and praised Kennedy forignoring U.S. perceptions that the Soviets were further advanced intesting.   Alexei Roshchkin, a disarmament expert in the Soviet foreignministry at the time of the signing, concurred.   ``This was a first step in post-war history ... a first step inthe field of disarmamanent,'' he said.   Theodore Sorensen, special counsel to the president from 1961 to1963 and part of a small group of advisers that guided the talksfrom Washington by telephone, said ``there was a great sense of joyand relief when word was received'' at the White House that thetreaty had been signed.   ``But backslapping was not the Kennedy way,'' Sorensen said.``On the contrary, he immediately began to worry about Senateratification,'' which came in the fall. Intense lobbying by thepresident left only 11 Democrats and eight Republicans opposed.   Soviet officials recalled the jubilation of their leader, NikitaKhrushchev, as described by former Kennedy aide Arthur M.Schlesinger Jr. in his book, ``A Thousand Days.''   As Khrushchev and U.S. Undersecretary of State Averell Harrimanstrode through a Kremlin park, ``a huge crowd collected behindthem,'' Schlesinger wrote.   According to the book, Khrushchev turned and asked the crowd:```We've just signed a test-ban treaty. I'm going to take him todinner. Do you think he's earned his dinner?' The people applaudedand applauded.''   The signing and subsequent ratification followed 336 nuclearexplosions in the atmosphere by the United States, Britain and theSoviet Union over 13 years.   The agreement also was important as a tangible sign of emergingdetente after the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 brought theworld to the brink of nuclear war.   France and China, the only other nations that openly engaged innuclear weapons test programs, have not agreed to the test ban. Butall French nuclear explosions have been underground since 1974, andChina exploded its last atmospheric device in 1980.   Disagreement on verification measures has held up jointratification of the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty limiting test explosions to 150kilotons. A kiloton equals the explosive force of 1,000 tons of TNT.   U.S. and Soviet negotiators began a second round of talks onratifying those two treaties in February, and participants Mondayinvoked the Limited Test Ban treaty as an example that agreement ispossible.</TEXT></DOC>
