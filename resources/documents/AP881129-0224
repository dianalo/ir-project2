The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees the nation's3,028 federally insured Sandamp;Ls, on Monday proposed an ``earlyintervention'' plan that would permit it to install new managementbefore an institution actually becomes insolvent.   It is also considering regulations requiring institutions withriskier real estate and commercial investments to hold more capital,or reserve funds, than institutions investing mostly in residentialmortgages, the traditional mainstay of the thrift industry.   The proposals ``seek to prevent problems before they arise and toresolve those that arise before they cost ... significant sums,''bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said in a statement.   A draft of the new rules will be formally issued in about twoweeks by the board, which will allow 90 days for public commentbefore taking final action.   Capital is the difference between an institution's loans andother assets and its deposits and other liabilities. Aninstitution's losses come out of its capital. Thus, Sandamp;Ls with morecapital are less likely to fail and require rescue by the governmentdeposit insurance fund.   The industry's capital level has fallen dramatically during the1980s. Early in the decade, high interest rates ate into profits.Later, the collapse of oil prices and Southwestern real estatepushed many Sandamp;Ls into the red. Critics say lax capital standardsmade the problem worse.   Bank board officials say capital at the typical, or median,institution was 5.6 percent in 1980, fell to a low of 3.5 percent in1984 and has since rebounded to 5.2 percent.   The new risk-based rule would require capital of 8 percent byJanuary 1993. The current goal is 6 percent, with no fixed date setfor reaching that.   The new policy also would permit regulators to take action whenan institution's capital falls to 1.5 percent of assets, rather thanwait until it disappears completely.   Roughly 500 institutions are currently considered insolvent. Atthe end of September, an additional 269 would have been subject tobank board action under the 1.5 percent standard, said JohnFiechter, managing director for policy in the bank board'sregulatory office.   The proposed new regulations would give institutionsconcentrating on residential mortgages a break, requiring only halfas much capital for a home mortgage as for a commercial loan. Itwould require a fifth as much capital for mortgage-backed securities.   However, the standard for direct investments in real estate,corporate stock and other ventures and for junk bonds is triple thestandard for commercial loans. Also, institutions that borrow moneyby pledging their assets as collateral would have to raise morecapital.   If the mix of the industry's investments were to remainunchanged, the proposal would force a 25 percent increase in Sandamp;Ls'capital, Fiechter said.   ``It will certainly be an incentive for thrifts to stay in theirtraditional business,'' said Joseph T. Lynyak III, an attorney withMcKenna, Conner andamp; Cuneo, which specializes in financial services law.   The proposal is similar to rules adopted in August by commercialbank regulators. However, unlike the bank rules, the Sandamp;L rules alsorequire institutions more vulnerable to fluctuations in interestrates to have more capital.   Wendy Samuel, general counsel for the National Council of SavingsInstitutions, a trade group, said the industry recognizes the needfor additional capital tied to risk. However, she said the bankboard must adopt measures to encourage capital formation.   ``The targets are certainly ... laudable as an ideal,'' she said.``But, it's going to be a while before it's practical. You're notgoing to wave a magic wand and declare, `Now there's capital.'''   Bert Ely, an industry analyst in Alexandria, Va., said theprospect of increasing capital is poor because most Sandamp;Ls' earningsare low and the market for their stock is depressed.   ``Where do they (regulators) think the money is going to comefrom? ... I think they're going to have a lot of problemsimplementing this,'' he said.   He added that the 269 institutions subject to action under the1.5 percent threshold ``are going to scream bloody murder,''increasing pressure on Congress and regulators to grant exceptionsfrom the rules.</TEXT></DOC>
