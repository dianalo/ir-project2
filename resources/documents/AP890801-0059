Col. William R. Higgins because Israel refused to free acaptured Shiite Moslem cleric.   The Soviet Union denounced the reported hanging and also faultedIsrael for kidnapping Shiite Moslem cleric Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid.   In Tunis, an adviser to PLO chief Yasser Arafat denounced thereported execution of Higgins but said Israel bore theresponsibility.   ``We condemn the abduction of innocents and the taking ofhostages and those who are the authors and we condemn even more theState of Israel which practices state terrorism,'' Bassam AbuSharif said.   Higgins' captors, who call themselves the Organization of theOppressed on Earth, claimed they hanged Higgins on Monday becauseIsrael refused to release Obeid.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev read a briefstatement saying, ``We resolutely denounce this inhuman action.   ``The fact that the aggravation of the situation in Lebanon,caused specifically by the abduction of Shiite leader Sheikh Obeidby Israeli commandos, has led to an escalation of acts of violenceand terror and evokes profound concern,'' the statement said.   Condemnation of the purported hanging was widespread.   ``It's an absolutely barbaric act, consistent with the worstdimensions of terrorism,'' said Prime Minister Brian Mulroney ofCanada said of the Higgins death claim.   Japan condemned the reported hanging as ``extremely shameful andinhuman.''   The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that``condemns unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking and abduction.''   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar expressed ``outrageand revulsion ... that an innocent man, serving the United Nationsin the cause of peace, should be murdered in this fashion.''   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., led a 75-man observer team attachedto the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when he wasabducted near Tyre on Feb. 17, 1988.   Timur Goksel, spokesman for U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon,said ``If it's true it's one of the saddest days for allpeacekeepers in the world.''   British Foreign Secretary John Major said in London that, if thereports were true, ``this is cold-blooded murder, brazen savageryof the worst sort and quite unforgivable.''   Syria, which supported Iran in its war with Iraq, said:``Killing Higgins, who was not guilty of anything, is a crime thatviolates all humanitarian principles and norms.''   Iran did not comment immediately on the death report.   Earlier, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said the threat toHiggins ``has nothing to do with us,'' but added that Israel shouldbe pressed to release Obeid. ``We condemn any kind of kidnapping ordeath threat,'' he said.   Many officials questioned the veracity of the claim Higgins waskilled Monday, which was accompanied by a poor quality videotapeshowing a man hanging from a scaffold.   There have been reports that his captors killed the Americanlast year.   Nasouh Majali, Jordan's information minister, said of thereported kiling: ``This is horrible.'' Before the report thatHiggins had been killed, Majali called the abduction of Obeid ``anact of terror.''   The Israelis ``are condemning terror and they are using the samemeans,'' he said.   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson of Sweden said killing Higginswas ``a heinous crime'' that should be condemned along with Obeid'sabduction.</TEXT></DOC>
