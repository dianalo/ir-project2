<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-39-0573 </DOCNO><TEXT>A brief description is given of the modifications to a 2-MW Van de Graaffaccelerator that are required to incorporate a field-emission ion source.The source is used to obtain a 1-microA beam of Ga/sup +/ ions. Lifetimemeasurements using the beam-foil technique are reported for the 4s5s/sup1/S,4s4p/sup 1/P,4s4d/sup 1/D,4s5D/sup 1/D,4p/sup 21/D,4s5s/sup 3/S,4p/sup23/P, and 4s4d/sup 3/D terms of Ga II and for the 5s/sup 2/S,4p/sup 2/P,4d/sup2/D, and 5f/sup 2/F terms of Ga III. A detailed discussion is given ofthe cascading problem in the case of the Ga II resonance transition at1414 Angstrom.</TEXT></DOC>
