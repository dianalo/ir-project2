For 1986, the most recent year for which figures are available, the commodities accounted for 93 million tons, or 6% of total railroad tonnage, and $2.1 billion, or 8% of total railroad revenue.    The proposal, if cleared, would let railroads set rates without filing tariffs with the commission for the commodities, which include various foodstuffs, textiles, leather, chemical and paper products, and machinery. Now, railroads must file the tariffs; if a shipper protests the rate, the commission may review, and possibly lower, the rate.    The commission said it made the proposal because truck transportation is so widely available as &quot;to make it impossible for railroads to abuse any market power they may possess.&quot;    A spokesman for the Association of American Railroads, a trade group, said that he wasn't familiar with the ICC proposal, but that the organization generally favors steps toward deregulation.    The final rule won't be issued for several months. </TEXT></DOC>
