ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oliver North's lawyer, in an emotional finalargument Wednesday, portrayed the former White House aide as asacrificial lamb, a scapegoat and a hostage, and implored jurors inhis trial to ``set him free.''   ``Oliver North never wanted to be a hero,'' said BrendanSullivan. ``He just wants to go home.''   But prosecutor John Keker, having the last word, asked the juryto ``return a verdict of guilty in each and every one of the 12charges.''   With that, the nine women and three men who will decide North'sfate were sent home. They will return Thursday to begin theirdeliberations after instructions from U.S. District Judge GerhardA. Gesell. During deliberation, the jury will be sequestered forthe first time since the Iran-Contra trial began.   In his hour-long rebuttal, Keker said it had been an ``unhappy,unpleasant, miserable criminal trial,'' and dismissed Sullivan'sclosing argument with a Shakesperian touch: ``It was all sound andfury, signifying nothing.''   ``You have heard a lot about courage at this trial,'' Kekersaid. ``There's another kind of courage: courage, to admit when youare wrong, corage to admit personal responsibility, courage toadmit guilt where appropriate. He (North) has not admitted any ofthose things; it's time for you to do it for him.''   It was the end of two tough days for North, a former Marinelieutenant colonel whose power while he was at the NationalSecurity Council was substantial. His face paled and he busiedhimself with writing while Keker denounced him; he looked at thejury while Sullivan pleaded for him.   ``The government has not shown criminal behavior,'' Sullivansaid. ``The man who held the lives of others in his hands, now putshis life into yours.'' The reference was to North's protectingnames of people he dealt with by shredding or altering documents,which Sullivan saw as ``a reasonable thing to do.''   Keker had another explanation: ``He was destroying documentsdeliberately so they wouldn't find what he didn't want them tofind.''   After the arguments, North's mood brightened and he joined hiswife, who was speaking with a minister in the front row ofspectators.   Sullivan, choked with emotion throughout much of his three-hourclosing argument, mentioned President Reagan's telephone call onthe day North was fired, a call in which the president called North``a national hero,'' and also a postcard North got from then-VicePresident Bush thanking him for his work.   ``All these people who went to Ollie North for help, where arethey now?'' Sullivan asked.   Summing up North's defense in the trial's 12th week, Sullivansaid he had done his job well as a White House aide, followingsuperiors' orders to help the Nicaraguan rebels, then was thrownoverboard as Reagan sought to escape political heat over the affair.   Sullivan told the jury that North, who had worked to freeAmerican hostages in Lebanon, has been, in a sense, a hostagehimself.   ``I ask you, on the evidence, to set him free,'' said Sullivan.   In the spectator section, behind North at the defense table,were his wife and three of his four children. Betsy North had beenat the trial before, but it was a first for the children. During arecess, North took their youngest daughter by the hand and walkedwith her down the courtroom corridor.   North is charged with 12 criminal counts, including lying toCongress and the attorney general, illegally converting traveler'schecks to his own use and conspiring to defraud the Treasurythrough a tax scam to support the rebels fighting the Nicaraguangovernment. If convicted, he could receive prison terms totaling 60years and fines of $3 million.   Sullivan sought to persuade the jurors that the government hadpresented only weak evidence to back up the charges against North,whom he described as caught ``between a rock and a hard place'' intrying to keep state secrets while he was asked by Congress to tellall.   ``He was fired from the White House, offered as a sacrificiallamb so to speak to the raging Congress,'' Sullivan said, referringto the day North was fired in November 1986.   Leaning forward and almost whispering to the jury, Sullivanasked, ``What do you think was happening? I draw the conclusion thepresident was using Ollie North as a scapegoat and threw himoverboard to escape some political heat.''   Sullivan said North was innocent of the charges that he liedabout raising funds for the Contras, saying there was no evidencethat North ever raised the subject with a contributor or that moneywas given in his presence.   He said Reagan had met with contributors, including one who soonafter donated $1 million worth of stock.   ``What is the difference between what the president did andOliver North did?'' Sullivan asked. ``The president is happilyretired in California and Ollie North has been in Washington 2{years fighting for his reputation.''   Sullivan noted that Keker had used a biblical quotation in hisfinal argument Tuesday, and said he had one of his own.   ``Greater love has no man than he be willing to lay down hislife for another,'' Sullivan said.   ``That's the kind of man Ollie North is,'' he said. ``Now hecries out. In a sense he's been a hostage. I ask you, on theevidence, to set him free.''   The Iran-Contra affair was ``like a big octopus,'' saidSullivan. ``The president, McFarlane, Poindexter, Casey ... theyare all reaching out to get Ollie North to run something. ... Theyare all reaching out to get him.''   He referred to former National Security Advisers RobertMcFarlane and John Poindexter and the late CIA Director WilliamCasey.</TEXT></DOC>
