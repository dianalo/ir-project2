Long used on offshore-drilling platforms and other dangerous job sites, police-style crackdowns are spreading to other industrial sites and are beginning to reach into white-collar workplaces.    &quot;When we first got in this business in 1981, we never had a client talk to us about bringing in dogs,&quot; says William L. Taylor, president of Professional Law Enforcement, a Dayton, Ohio-based security-consulting firm. Now, he says, 25% to 30% of his clients are considering using dogs.    Advocates consider the method to be less invasive than urinalysis -- and more reliable. They say that dogs can detect drugs from a distance, without the need to rummage through desk drawers or personal belongings. And unlike urine tests, dogs can uncover the stashes of drug dealers.    &quot;The biggest benefit is the visibility,&quot; says W.E. Irby, manager of environmental safety at Mobay Chemical Inc., a Pittsburgh-based chemicals concern that has conducted monthly searches with dogs since 1979 in its Baytown, Texas, plant. &quot;It sends a message to the employees that we don't want narcotics in here.&quot; Mr. Irby adds: &quot;In a large plant or business, you just couldn't find all the hiding places.&quot;    But critics of the dog brigade say the method invades workers' privacy unnecessarily, and that in an office where business is conducted on personal trust, such search and seizure methods can drain morale.    &quot;The Rambo approach in business simply does not work,&quot; says James Depoe, president of Focus EAP Inc., an employee-assistance firm in Stafford, Texas. &quot;How do you justify the cost of dogs and detectives when we know the educational programs are good and work?&quot;    Adds Jim Clemons, medical director of Republic Health Corp., a Dallas healthcare provider: &quot;That's a police-state-type approach to things that begins to create an atmosphere of fear and paranoia among employees.&quot;    Because the proportion of office workers involved in drug trafficking invariably grows in economic downturns, it isn't surprising that half the nation's 20 canine-detective agencies specializing in drug investigations are in oil-busted Texas.    One such firm is Security Associates International in Houston, the largest canine agency in the country. &quot;In the last three years our clientele (for drug-sniffing dogs) has increased more than 100%,&quot; says Fredrick H. Newman, president of Security Associates. &quot;In 1984, we were servicing 30 to 35 commercial clients. Now it's well over 80 clients.&quot;    Some employers try to limit dog searches to a small group of employees. But for others, surgical strikes aren't enough. That apparently was the case last month, when Exxon Corp. subjected 1,000 white-collar workers in Houston to a massive search by six teams of specially trained dogs, mostly Labrador retrievers.    The animals were led through the four buildings of Exxon's four-building Brookhollow office complex, north of downtown Houston, focusing primarily on the company's credit-card operations. The parking lots were also covered. According to an Exxon spokesman, of the 1,000 employees searched, 12 were fired -- mostly for marijuana possession.    Widespread searches of white-collar employees are more common where employees require a high level of safety awareness, as at the South Texas Nuclear Project in Baytown, Texas, now nearing completion by Houston Lighting andamp; Power Co. Over the past four years, the company says, more than a half-dozen searches were aimed at construction workers, as well as at engineers and office managers. Some 50 people were fired as a result.    Widespread dog searches have touched off controversy partly because they occur in the presence of fellow workers. A Burlington Northern Railroad spokesman says the company recently lined up a group of employees after a 12-hour shift so a dog could sniff their valises. One woman engineer was asked to open her case for inspection; it turned up only birth-control pills and other personal medications, according to the Burlington spokesman.    Critics say there's a fine line between the corporate right to a drug-free workplace and the employee's right to privacy -- and dignity. &quot;If they sniff your car that's one thing,&quot; says Don Horn, executive secretary of the AFL-CIO. &quot;If they sniff your pants leg, that's another.&quot;    Labor and civil-rights groups question the legality as well as the propriety of canine drug sweeps. Bruce Griffiths, a lawyer for ther American Civil Liberties Union in Houston, has doubts about the &quot;probable cause&quot; of drug use that Exxon cited to defend its massive white-collar search. &quot;Can they have probable cause to search 1,000 people?&quot; Mr. Griffiths asks. He and others also denounce the practice of having employees sign waivers on the day of a search. Exxon's waivers caution employees that they &quot;may be subject to discipline&quot; upon refusal to sign. An Exxon spokesman declines comment.    Meanwhile, the dogs' keen sense of smell may lead to trouble. When Jim Hale, publisher of the Kansas City Star, found out drug-sniffing dogs react the same way to cough syrup as they do to pot, he abandoned plans last year to search the newsroom. &quot;We were committed not to open any desks,&quot; he says. And the outraged reaction of his staff eased his decision to back down. &quot;It was causing so much grief,&quot; he says, &quot;we didn't do it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
