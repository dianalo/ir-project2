Bennett's argument in favor of mandatory AIDS testing (&quot;We Need Routine Testing for AIDS,&quot; editorial page, May 26) overestimates the public-health value of an AIDS antibody test result, regardless of whether the result is negative or positive. Because an individual with a negative test result could change to positive antibody status at any time, testing would have to be repeated periodically on all subjects. Thus, any testing program would be massive, expensive and of indefinite duration.    Mr. Bennett is twice in error when he says that &quot;testing informs individuals if they have contracted AIDS so they can seek proper medical treatment.&quot; A positive AIDS antibody test does not diagnose AIDS or ARC (AIDS-related complex), both of which are based on clinical symptoms of the disease, nor does it predict whether the individual will go on to develop a clinical case of AIDS. And unfortunately, there is no &quot;treatment&quot; available for asymptomatic infected individuals that will either free them of infection or prevent the manifestation of a clinical case of AIDS. The medical advice given to such an individual to prevent the spread of HIV infection is to refrain from high-risk activities -- precisely the same advice given to individuals with a negative test result.    In some instances, coercive measures, including mandatory medical testing, may be needed to halt the spread of a disease. But such extreme and intrusive measures are not justified when, as with AIDS antibody testing, the information generated does little or nothing to promote the health of the individul tested or of society.    Prof. Mark A. Rothstein   Director, Health Law Institute   University of Houston   Houston   ---   Mr. Bennett tells us that &quot;we can all agree that we must prevent violations of the civil rights of those who are carriers of the AIDS virus.&quot; His concerns for civil rights smack of a profound and venomous hypocrisy, since he is a member of a presidential administration that has acted at every juncture to deny civil rights and simple compassion to individuals who have been exposed to HIV.    The Reagan administration has begun to administer routine tests for exposure to HIV to military personnel, Foreign Service employees of the State Department, and applicants to the Peace Corps and the federal Jobs Corps. Individuals who test positive for exposure to HIV then are discriminated against, either by refusal to hire, by discharge or by receiving restricted assignments. The medical justifications offered for this organized discrimination were condemned by medical and public-health experts at the Centers for Disease Control's HIV testing conference last February in Atlanta. Indeed, one suspects that this HIV testing program is only another manifestation of the historic antipathy toward homosexuals by the armed services and the State Department: that which cannot be discerned behaviorally can now be tested biologically.    Far from seeking to discourage discrimination, Mr. Bennett's administration has been an active agent in its practice. His profession of caring and concern for the victims of AIDS-related discrimination rings hollow. Strong measures prohibiting AIDS-related discrimination in employment, housing, insurance and government benefits are desperately needed for humanitarian and public-health purposes, and it is the responsibility of Congress and state legislatures to enact such laws.    Prof. Mark Barnes   Columbia University School of Law    New York   ---   After reading Mr. Bennett's piece, I reached the conclusion that he would much prefer being an M.D. heading our nation's highest medical office, than a Ph.D. heading our nation's highest education office.    Not once in his entire article does he mention education as a priority in halting this killing disease. Yet health and education officials in New York City, and generally throughout the country, agree that slowing down the disease among gay men mostly can be attributed to the continuing education programs conducted by a few nonprofit organizations (with an extremely limited budget) in the city.    Perhaps the good secretary should return to school, go for his M.D. and, meanwhile, relinquish his post to an educator.    John F. Hartman   Plainfield, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
