Whether they become simple dashes to the nomination or torturous marathons, the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns are taking on more the character of obstacle courses than of simple road races, with some of the most complicated rules in the history of American politics.    From today on, the shape of the presidential races will be determined not only by personality, character, issues, money and media presence but also by the rules themselves. &quot;They are the driving force behind everything that happens from here on in,&quot; says Thomas Donilon, a Washington lawyer who became a rules expert while holding top positions in Jimmy Carter's and Walter Mondale's presidential campaigns. &quot;The rules drive how much money you spend, how you get on ballots, how you deploy your people.&quot;    The rules provide the landscape of the campaign. They determine which candidates compete; politicians who don't satisfy arcane state laws don't win convention delegates. They determine the levels of public involvement; states with party caucuses rather than primaries usually invite more people into the process.    The rules also mean that candidates with little organization, such as former Sen. Gary Hart, and little expertise, such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson, face major hurdles in the race to gather delegates. They mean that chances for a brokered convention are slim, but that Democrats, who generally distribute their delegates by proportional representation, are more likely to have one than Republicans, who use winner-take-all delegate schemes in many states.    The first major factor in this year's races is the growth in primaries. The process of taking the selection of the nominee out of the hands of a few dozen party bosses and putting it into the hands of millions of voters has produced 35 primaries this year, five more than in 1984 and more than double the number in 1968.    The other major factor is the calendar. The first delegates will be chosen by Republicans at a convention in Michigan this month, but the first significant political tests for both parties are here in Iowa, where five weeks from tonight party members gather at 4,986 locations throughout the state and register their preferences at precinct caucuses. Eight days later, the voters of New Hampshire make their choices in the first primary. The largest number of convention delegates ever to be chosen at one time occurs on Super Tuesday, March 8, when voters in 20 states make their selections --in all, more than a third of the delegates to each convention.    The primaries come earlier and faster than ever before --not a prescription for sober voter analysis. This year, three-quarters of the delegates will be selected by the end of April; fewer than half were chosen by the same time in 1968.    Many political analysts worry that the compression of the delegate-selection process may create an irresistible bandwagon effect. Four weeks passed between George Bush's upset victory in the Iowa caucuses in 1980 and the next voter test of the GOP candidates. Four weeks after the Iowa caucuses this year, more than half the states will have selected delegates.    Super Tuesday grew out of Democrats' worries that the South, for generations the core of the party's support, didn't have a sufficiently big voice in choosing the party's nominee. Because Democrats control state legislatures throughout the South, both parties' primaries were moved to March 8.    But another twist in election rules --half the Super Tuesday states permit voters to cast ballots in whatever party's primary they choose --may cause the Democrats' gambit to distort the process further. &quot;Super Tuesday might backfire badly for Democrats,&quot; warns Earl Black, a University of South Carolina expert in Southern politics. &quot;Some conservative Democratic state legislators wanted to help shape their party's race, but a lot of the voters they need may be more interested in the battles in the Republican Party.&quot;    Such &quot;crossover&quot; voters provide an important part of the battleground of the election in 28 states, including such important Super Tuesday states as Georgia, Texas, Missouri and Tennessee. Will Democratic evangelicals forsake their party to vote for Republican Pat Robertson, the former television minister? Will Republican Tennesseans flock to vote for home-state Democrat Albert Gore?    Moreover, the two parties' methods for selecting delegates vary sharply --and these distinctions may make the difference between a short race and a long, bloody one, and between having a clear-cut winner at the national party convention or a brokered convention.    Republican delegate rules generally work toward a crisper resolution of the nomination struggle. Thirteen GOP state parties operate under some form of winner-take-all format, many of them, like Florida and Ohio, granting large numbers of delegates to candidates who prevail within a congressional district. California, however, operates under a system in which the winner of the state's June 7 primary takes all 175 convention delegates --nearly 8% of all the delegates at the convention.    The effect is to winnow out Republican candidates swiftly, for those who fall behind the pace don't win many, if any, delegates, get branded as losers and watch their treasuries dry up. But the Republican rules, crowned by the big California prize at the end of the process, make it easier for a comeback than it would be on the Democratic side.    The vast majority of Democratic state rules use proportional representation to allocate delegates, a system that permits candidates to remain in the race longer than they would in the GOP. &quot;It allows the second-place candidate to stay in longer because even people who continually lose primaries are continually winning delegates,&quot; says Elaine Kamarck, deputy campaign manager for former Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona.    But the Democratic system hurts latebloomers. Although Jimmy Carter petered out in midstream in 1976, he kept winning delegates despite late strong showings by Gov. Edmund &quot;Jerry&quot; Brown Jr. of California and Sen. Frank Church of Idaho.    The Democratic proportional-representation rule applies only to candidates who cross a threshold of 15% of the vote in each congressional district. The 15% figure was adopted after Mr. Jackson claimed that a complex threshold formula in 1984 unfairly diminished his impact at the San Francisco convention.    It isn't enough simply to win the support of voters in primaries this year; candidates must file slates of delegates if they are to translate popular victories into convention power --a fact that Mr. Hart discovered in his first outing in presidential politics in 1984, when his drive for the nomination was hurt because he hadn't filed complete slates in important states such as Florida, Pennsylvania and Illinois.    That lesson has been learned by other candidates preparing for this year's election. &quot;You don't want to break out of the pack and then find you can't go any further because you don't have any delegates recruited,&quot; says Ms. Kamarck.    Filing delegate slates is one of the most complicated tasks of presidential politics. Delegates in some states, for example, are assembled by caucuses before the primaries --in many cases at the same time a candidate has deployed his best organizers in Iowa. In Pennsylvania, no delegate slates are permitted; individuals wishing to run as delegates themselves must gather 250 signatures. &quot;The selection of delegates,&quot; says Gina Glantz, national field director for Mr. Mondale in 1984, &quot;is not always popular democracy at work.&quot;    A variety of state laws, generally more respected by Republicans than Democrats, control delegate behavior at the convention.    This year's Democratic convention in Atlanta will include all Democratic governors, all the members of the Democratic National Committee and four out of every five members of the House and Senate. Republicans haven't any automatic delegates, but offer bonuses to states that have GOP elected officials and that have gone Republican in presidential elections.    &quot;Rules aren't neutral,&quot; says Austin Ranney, a University of California political scientist. &quot;Basketball's rules favor tall guys, and political rules favor certain kinds of candidates. And often it's not a case of who the rules help, but who they hurt.&quot;    ---                     The Calendar    Key dates in the race for the presidential nominations:    Feb. 8      Iowa caucuses    Feb. 16     New Hampshire primary    March 8     Super Tuesday (20 state select delegates)    March 15    Illinois primary    April 19    New York primary    April 26    Pennsylvania primary    June 7      California, New Jersey, Montana and                New Mexico primaries   ---                  The Delegate Race          Percentage of delegates chosen by:                           Democrats     Republicans    February 16                2%             7%    March 8                   43             51    March 29                  60             58    April 26                  77             73    May 10                    85             82    June 17                  100            100</TEXT></DOC>
