Some Western lawmakers have called for big changes in thelaw, and they had hoped for White House backing. But MikeHayden, assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks,said the Bush administration wouldn't recommend such acourse, and he expressed doubt that it would succeed. &quot;Therewill be some people saying radical things, but I don't thinkthey'll prevail,&quot; he told a group of reporters.</LP><TEXT>   The law, under which the government can limit developmentto protect species in danger of becoming extinct, hasprovoked a number of fights between environmentalists andindustry. Mr. Hayden said he does expect Congress to approvesome &quot;fine-tuning&quot; of the law.   On other matters, Mr. Hayden said he opposed someproposals to toughen the government's policy on dealing withcompanies that hold concession contracts in national parks.He said a bill that Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.) is expectedto introduce might restrict the rights of concessionaires somuch that the most qualified companies wouldn't be interestedin the job. But he praised provisions to raise the franchisefees paid to the government and to place revenue fromconcessions in a special account isolated from thecongressional appropriations process.</TEXT></DOC>
