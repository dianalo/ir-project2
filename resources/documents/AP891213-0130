(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA said Wednesday it had delayedthe pre-Christmas launch of space shuttle Columbia at least twodays because of lagging work at the launch pad.   A statement said the new date of Dec. 20 is ``successoriented,'' meaning that any minor new problem could slip theliftoff to the 21st.   It said additional time is needed to validate systems onrecently renovated launch pad 39A and to prepare Columbia.   ``We feel confident about readiness for a pre-Christmasliftoff,'' said William Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator forspace flight.   NASA spokesman Karl Kristofferson said a lot of small problems,many associated with new pad facilities, had put launch crewsbehind schedule.   If liftoff slipped to Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, itprobably would be postponed a few more days to free workers for theholiday.   With the change, the shuttle swapped launch dates with a Titan 3commercial rocket that had been scheduled for liftoff on Dec. 20.The Titan, which is to boost British and Japanese communicationssatellites, was rescheduled for 7:20 p.m. EST Monday.   During a 10-day mission, Columbia's five astronauts are to put aNavy communications satellite into orbit and recover a sciencesatellite before it falls to Earth. The satellite has been in orbitnearly six years and is expected to re-enter the atmosphere inFebruary.   The flight duration will equal the longest shuttle mission todate and will be a stepping stone for even longer flights asColumbia is being modified to stay aloft for 16 days and later for28 days.   Loading of propellants for Columbia's in-flight propulsionsystems and auxiliary power units began a day late Monday because afaulty connector on an electronics box had to be replaced.   Once the fueling began, the launch pad had to be cleared of allnon-essential personnel because it is dangerous. That preventedworkers from making up lost time in other areas.   Work was running late even before the connector problem becauseof difficulties working with new systems on a mobile launchplatform being used for the first time and with the launch pad,which recently underwent a two-year, $50 million refurbishment,receiving 130 modifications.   In announcing a Dec. 18 launch date, NASA cautioned last weekthat the flight might have to be delayed a day or so because of thenew systems.   Astronaut Dan Brandenstein will command Columbia's crew. Theother crew members are pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialistsBonnie Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and David Low.</TEXT></DOC>
