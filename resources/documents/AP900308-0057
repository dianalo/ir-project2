The witnesses said smokebegan billowing from the roof shortly before 10 a.m.   The 281-room hotel, owned by the government's Egyptian HotelsCo., had an occupancy of ``almost 90 percent'' at the time of thefire, but most guests had left their rooms when it broke out, hotelofficials said.   Maj. Gen. Fakhreddin Khalid, chief of tourist police, said thefire began in the ground-floor kitchen of an Asian food restaurantand sent smoke up a chimney to the roof, where it was seenthroughout the neighborhood.   He said the the thick smoke was caused partly by sparks from thekitchen touching fat and grease inside the chimney. There was``hardly any damage'' to the hotel, he said.   Last week, an early-morning fire driven by strong windsdevastated the 630-room Heliopolis Sheraton Hotel on Cairo'snortheastern outskirts.
