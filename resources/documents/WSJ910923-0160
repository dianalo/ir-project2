More important, the warm dinner inSt. Petersburg and the effusive praise afterwards illustratedhow the U.S. is reaching out to a new cast of reformers nowthat the Bush administration's favorite Soviet politician,President Mikhail Gorbachev, has assumed a sharply diminishedrole.   In fact, reaching out to these new faces was one of thepurposes of Mr. Baker's five-day trip to the Soviet Unionthis month. Officials say they wanted to realign U.S.contacts to reflect the new political reality as power flowsaway from the Kremlin and the apparatchiks there and towarddemocratic reformers, radical economists and republicanleaders who were in the political wilderness just a couple ofyears ago.   A few of these leaders appear to be emerging as the newfavorites of U.S. officials. President Bush and Mr. Baker hadmet with most of them before last month's failed coup, butthe political earthquake that followed guarantees thatAmericans will hear much more about these rising stars in themonths ahead.   Mr. Sobchak may be the brightest of the new faces. A legalacademician by background, he was so obscure just a year agothat friends had to coax members of the Washingtonestablishment to meet with him when he visited here.   Now, one U.S. official calls him a &quot;Russian FDR.&quot; He hasmade a profound impact by pushing economic reform programs inSt. Petersburg and by boldly resisting the August coup. AndU.S. officials hint they might want to work closely with Mr.Sobchak to set up some free-enterprise &quot;demonstrationprojects&quot; in St. Petersburg to create a few capitalistsuccess stories that will inspire Soviets to take theinitiative themselves.   The other bright new faces:   Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of the enormous,mineral-rich Asian republic of Kazakhstan. Mr. Baker flewmore than six hours to the distant Kazakh capital of Alma Atafor just a half-day of meetings with Mr. Nazarbayev. Thatdemonstrates U.S. respect for Mr. Nazarbayev's role as anadvocate of free enterprise and champion of an economictreaty among the Soviet republics. Mr. Nazarbayev ruffledfeathers in pre-coup Moscow -- and pleased the U.S. -- byinviting Chevron Corp. to develop the big Tengiz oil field.   Now Mr. Nazarbayev shows his economic independence bycomplaining that the project was held up by &quot;politicalentities&quot; in Russia, but that he intends to complete it. Itisn't clear, though, how much he champions democracy.   Grigory Yavlinsky, an economist and champion of radicalreform. For more than a year, he pushed in vain for a radicalturn to a market economy, but he couldn't get his ideasadopted by the Soviet government. So he devoted his energiesin part to working with Mr. Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan.   The collapse of Soviet communism has turned Mr. Yavlinskyfrom outsider to insider -- a change starkly illustrated whenhe sat just to Mr. Gorbachev's right as the Soviet presidentmet with Mr. Baker in the Kremlin. Mr. Yavlinsky is largelyresponsible for drafting an economic treaty to link the 15Soviet republics, and an economic reform plan. He consultsclosely with U.S. officials, particularly Undersecretary ofState Robert Zoellick.   Alexander Yakovlev, a longtime Gorbachev adviser who nowis working to foster a multiparty political system. Mr.Yakovlev warned Mr. Gorbachev in vain that the coup wascoming. Now he impresses U.S. officials with his sageanalysis.   When discussing recently what will be done with theleaders of the failed coup, Mr. Yakovlev told U.S. officialshe would give them an award because they had precipitatedchanges in three days that would have taken democraticreformers 15 years to accomplish.   Eduard Shevardnadze, the former foreign minister who nowleads the Movement for Democratic Reform. The organization isdevoted to political reform that probably will lead tocreation of a political party. Mr. Shevardnadze is an old newface, well known when he was the stylish Soviet foreignminister. He developed close ties to Mr. Baker at that time.   U.S. officials look to Mr. Shevardnadze as a valuableinterpreter of the new Soviet political scene. After meetinghim in Moscow, Mr. Baker said he had &quot;the closest feeling ofaffection for Eduard Shevardnadze, and that has notdiminished in the least since his retirement.&quot; But Mr.Shevardnadze's biggest problem is that he is a Georgian andlacks a solid political base in the Soviet Union.   Yevgeni Shaposhnikov, the new Soviet defense minister. Anair force officer who got his job simply by opposing thecoup, he has impressed U.S. officials with his eagerness, asone puts it, to &quot;transform the military into a totallydifferent institution.&quot; He particularly pleased U.S.officials by pleading for their help in building a militaryjustice system that will show the Soviet army isn't above therest of society.   Some U.S. officials are more skeptical of Mr.Shaposhnikov, who they think hasn't much of a track record.But he clearly benefits by being, as one official says,&quot;light years&quot; different from his predecessor, Dmitri Yazov,who helped launch the August coup.</TEXT></DOC>
