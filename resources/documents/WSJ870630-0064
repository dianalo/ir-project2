First American Financial said it paid $29.50 a share each for the 997,756 shares it purchased. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, First American Financial closed at $26, down $1.    First American said it can't provide a current value for the two properties in the transaction because the appraisals haven't been completed. The firm, a title insurance company, has about 4.5 million shares outstanding following the buyback.    American Century, a San Antonio, Texas-based savings and loan and real estate concern, said it will realize an after-tax gain of $13.9 million on the sale. </TEXT></DOC>
