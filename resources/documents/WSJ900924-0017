Separately, the Office of Thrift Supervision reported thatwithdrawals at the nation's savings and loans exceededdeposits by $9.65 billion in April, the nation's thriftregulator said. A month earlier, withdrawals exceededdeposits by $958 million, the smallest deposit outflow ineight months.   A spokesman for the OTS said most of the outflows occurredin California, where banks competed aggressively for depositsin that month.   The outflow of deposits also reflects, in part, the thriftindustry's shrinking efforts to meet new capitalrequirements. The Sandamp;Ls needn't hold as much capital if theyreduce their deposits. The number of Sandamp;L associations alsoshrank to 2,492 in April from 2,716 a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
