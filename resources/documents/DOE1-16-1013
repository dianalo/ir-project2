<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-16-1013 </DOCNO><TEXT>Literature data on synthesis, crystal and molecular structures, thermaland other properties of vanadium peroxocomplexes with the O/sub act/:V=2:1ratio are analysed. Monomers and dimers containing mixed and unmixedligands are considered. All monomeric oxodiperoxocomplexes of vanadium(5) are shown to be considered as derivatives of the [VO(O-O)/sub 2/(H/sub2/O)/sub x/]/sup -/ anion prepared by the substitution of water moleculesby other mono- and polydentate ligands. And a resistant coordinationpolyhedron in the form of a pentagonal pyramid or a pentagonal bipyramidis formed. All dimeric oxodiperoxocomplexes of vanadium (5) can be consideredas derivatives of the anion abovementioned, in which water moleculesare substituted by monodentate -OVO(O-O)/sub 2/ and -OHVO(O-O/sub 2/)ligands. 54 refs.; 9 figs.; 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
