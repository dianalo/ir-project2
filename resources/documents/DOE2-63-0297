<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-63-0297 </DOCNO><TEXT>Because of the increasing need for large area detectors the demand forintegrated structures containing both detector and readout electronicsbecomes more relevant than ever. Nevertheless progress is rather limited,the main reason being the compatibility of integrated circuit and detectorproducing technologies. This paper discusses several alternatives forthe practical realization of fully integrated detector-electronics circuits.The concept of full integration on high resistivity material is exploredin detail and will be illustrated by experimental results.</TEXT></DOC>
